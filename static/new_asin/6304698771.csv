921921,5,6304698771,"Being an adult, or atleast a person who attempted to be one from 8 to 5 each day, How the Grinch Stole christmas has always been one of my favourite animated movies. Dr Seuss was simply a master of rhyme, and the  animation of this story...priceless. The grinch, the poor little dog with  the antlers affixed to his little head, and all the who's down in whoville  make this a movie to be enjoyed by children of all ages :)",961977600,2,423,4.2625
921922,5,6304698771,"I compared a VHS version and DVD version to check the Grinch's ""color problem"" discribed by some reviewers of this DVD. True, the Grinch is not bright green on the DVD, but I don't think he is supposed to be. I did  not see any difference between the VHS and DVD versions of his color, and  did not think his color looked wrong at all.",946512000,16,335,4.138461538461539
921923,3,6304698771,"As much as I love the Grinch and Horton, this DVD had problems.  The Grinch is a mustardy-yellow color, Horton is a mess!  Thankfully, I got  this one cheap, but there really isn't much to this package.  I'm glad to  have the Grinch, but I wonder if I'll be buying another, better copy down  the line...",945129600,5,303,4.321428571428571
921924,5,6304698771,A truly wonderful classic!  I purchased and watched the DVD version just last week.  My entire family enjoyed watching it and I am sure it will get plenty of play.,944438400,2,163,4.4
921925,3,6304698771,"I have always loved this classic Dr. Seuss animated film and awaited its arrival with great anticipation.  And while the story is as endearing as ever, I am disappointed that the coloring on this transfer is terrible.  The backgrounds are garish and too bright and the Grinch is the color of  mustard instead of his true green color shown on the front of the case.  In  addition, the pencil tests are far too few and do not add any value to the  disc.  It is hard to focus on the splendid attributes of this title because  of its few, yet glaring oversights.  My advice is to wait for a better  transfer to come out, or perhaps seek out the previous version on dvd which  may be of better quality.",943920000,132,697,4.325581395348837
921926,5,6304698771,This DVD is a must for the holiday season.  It features the original Grinch classic plus Horton Hears A Who.

922397,2,6304698771,"I grew up as a kid in the 70s and 80s, ""back in the day"" when we only had three networks and catching a ""Christmas Classic"" was something all kids looked forward too and marked on their calendar.  When you see a DVD title today claiming ""Classic Christmas Favorites"" these are not the 10 movies I would have picked out... As Obi Wan might say ""these aren't the classics you're looking for""... of the 10, I would say YES, three of them are truly classic favorites and are probably worth the purchase price alone... the other seven are really cheesy spinoffs that weren't popular then, and still aren't popular now.

Below is a list of what you get and tell you if it is a classic or not-so-much of one...

DISC 1
Dr Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas - ***** 5-star classic, yes, of course this movie is great! Only feature on Disc-1 worth watching
The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold - What?
Pinocchio's Christmas - Nope...
The Stingiest Man in Town - Try again

DISC 2
The Year Without a Santa Claus: Deluxe Edition - ***** 5-star classic, yes, you too will get the Freeze Miser / Heat Miser song stuck in your head!
Rudolph's Shiny New Year - Not the movie you're looking for, you actually want Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, which isn't in this collection
Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey - You probably flipped the channel to Magnum P.I. in the 80s when this came on

DISC 3
Frosty's Winter Wonderland - Not the movie you're looking for, you actually want Frosty the Snowman, which isn't in this collection
'Twas the Night Before Christmas - **** 4-star classic... this is a hidden gem, well respected ""back in the day"" and one you always watched!

DISC 4
Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July - Christmas isn't in July, Frosty is melted by now, but this disc makes a handy drink coaster as nothing on it is worth watching",1516320000,,1834,4.542424242424242

I must say that the Horton hears a woo little short film freaks me out though. Also, I didn't like how they had at the end, how the movie was made and what people played what voices. That takes the fun out of the cartoon. Not only that, its boring and I don't see any kid wanting to see that.

Also, it says Rudolph's Shiny New Year and Nestor the Long Eared Christmas Donkey are on disc 2, which is not true. They are not included in this product at all.

924895,1,6304698771,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

Since we don't have cable, trying to catch a movie on TV can be tough, especially when the Netflix offerings are sparse. After watching ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" a dozen times on Youtube, I decided that this year would be the perfect time to get him the movie on DVD so he can watch it all year 'round. I was thrilled to come across this collection of old Christmas movies. I remember watching Frosty and the Misers every year growing up, and was so pleased to see how much my children fell in love with this classic. My husband loved the purchase as well! The movies look great on the screen, and we didn't have any issues with any of the discs. I highly recommend adding this set to your collection!",1456444800,,813,4.426666666666667

Among the other Christmas favorites, like Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, and of course the Peanuts Christmas, this movie was my favorite.  I think it is funny and entertaining for all ages, where some of the other common Christmas movies, especially the newer ones of today, are a bit difficult to tolerate.  I so very much appreciate these classic cartoons over the newer, digital movies.  The artwork is amazing and so impressively!  If you haven't seen this movie, you must!

I was able to watch this with my daughters this Christmas and it was by far the most requested rewatch of the season and it is a must have for anyone with kids, or a heart.  The extras that come with the download (or DVD) are fun to watch and everyone, including my four year old, was just as entertained by the extras as they were the movie.  We have a tradition of reading the Grinch a thousand times during Christmas, and about 50 times the week after.  That's a slight exaggeration of course but I can honestly say that the Grinch is the first book my seven year old memorized, word for word, when she was three and a half years old.  I tried to convince people she could read but I was always foiled when they asked her to read other books.  I'm off topic but for a good reason, the movie is fun and creates memories...great movie that transcends the animation and limitations of the day.",1452988800,,989,4.318918918918919

Never watched disc 2 though which includes my favs ""year without a santa Claus "" and ""rudolph's Shiney new year."" It's been replaced with some John Goodman movie by the same title and doesn't include any of the extras! Even though the description for the original titles is what's on the back! Certainly worth 5 stars if it had the original titles, but I was beyond frustrated with this discovery. Had to order it separately and just threw out the John Goodman movie (year without a santa Claus separately  comes with the same bonus titles as described in this set). I'd recommend checking disc 2 and if it's wrong,have it exchanged. Apparently the majority of people on here received the correct disc.",1449100800,10,772,4.718518518518518

So I broke down and bought the streamable version of the Grinch.  Now I won't have to go through endless YouTube searches for it next year.  We enjoyed it even though it should have been clearer.  I was really surprised it wasn't cleaned up more.  The video looked like a VCR recording of the Grinch.

Purchased this through Amazon Instant Video app. Colors and picture quality are exactly as I remember from childhood. It came with Horton Hears a Who, which I had never seen before. The actual book has a great message but the story in this animated feature is much different from the book. Same sort of message though, but I loved the book so much I couldn't get into it.

I was delighted to see it contains 10 movies, including every single classic I have been looking for! So glad I didn't have to buy them all separately.

The flick itself is perfect, of course. I can't imagine anyone is reading this to determine whether or not they should watch it...because they should.  But what's really important here is that I didn't have to go out into the cold wintry night to see if the library or the video store had this thing in stock, because I just had to load it up onto Amazon and call it a day.

The stop motion animation is charming and texturally appealing, the seemingly hand drawn backgrounds blend well with the rest of the setting giving the film a hand-made quality, and the dance numbers are lighthearted and humorous.
The Year without a Santa Claus Deluxe Edition: Synopsis: Santa thinks the world no longer cares about him and has decided to cancel his Christmas ride. Mrs. Claus disagrees and sends two elves and a reindeer into the world to find evidence of the Christmas spirit.
Other viewing suggestions: Mrs. Claus starring Angela Lansbury
Rudolphs Shiny New Year: Synopsis: Now famous Rudolph has been sent on a mission to find the baby new year and bring him back to the Palace of Time before time stops forever. The film gives interesting explanations about the life of a year and where old years retire when it is time for the next year to take over. Depictions of the islands in the Archipelago of Last Years present opportunities to teach children a little about history.
Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey: BEWARE: There are some depictions of animal abuse in this special. Synopsis: This is a religious special that chronicles the journey of a long-eared donkey, a protagonist similar to Rudolph, on his journey to Bethlehem and his part in the first Christmas.
Special Feature: We Are Santas Elves is a brief history of the Rankin/Bass legacy featuring, among others, Arthur Rankin, Jr.
The next two specials are not animated in the stop-motion format for which Rankin/Bass productions is well known.
Frostys Winter Wonderland: Synopsis:  In this sequel (made by Rankin/Bass) of the original Frosty the Snowman, Frosty returns from up north and finds himself lonely when it is time for the children to go inside so they make him a snow wife.
Twas the Night Before Christmas: This is an expansion of the classic tale. Synopsis: Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring except a clockmaker and Father Mouse because Santa may not come to their town this year.
Rudolph and Frostys Christmas in July: This is a stop-motion film. Plot: Winterbolt has awoken from his enchanted slumber and desires to rule the North Pole once more. Santa and Rudolph are seemingly all who stand in his way so he crafts an intricate plan to discredit Rudolph and replace Santa (deciding to steal Frostys magic along the way).
How the Grinch Stole Christmas Deluxe Edition: Synopsis: The Grinch is a mean and nasty hermit who, sets out to destroy Christmas by stealing everything used in the celebration of this holiday. The story crafted by Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and brought to life by Chuck Jones (along with other talents) has been re-mastered with bright, but not overly saturated colors so that the Grinch is green once more.
The Leprechauns Christmas Gold: Synopsis: Synopsis: After the captain of his ship spots an island in the distance, he sends one of his sailors to fetch a Christmas tree. Once on the island, the sailor meets a leprechaun and frees a banshee after the leprechauns gold.

Being a good is not easy for him and he winds up far from home wondering if he will even be home for Christmas. The animatic special offers a unique spin on the story and gives more depth to some of the background characters.
The Stingiest Man in Town: This is nothing more than an animated, and somewhat spooky, version of The Christmas Carol on which we follow Ebenezer Scrooge and our narrator B. A. H. Humbug on that fateful Christmas Eve journey through Scrooges past, present, and future until Scrooge finds himself filled with the Christmas spirit.",1393804800,,3893,4.889561270801815

928402,5,6304698771,"Years have gone by without me owning this movie.  Why!?  I do not know.  Maybe it's because mostly throughout the years we have had cable TV & the networks usually play it in December.  Well, in 2012, ditched cable in favor of Netflix & HuluPlus & we're saving hundreds of dollars a year.  Anyway, we shopped on the Amazon Video App on our PS3.  ""The Grinch"" is a must have for the holidays.  Dr. Seuss got it right.  I won't even go into the movie specifics on why its such a great movie.  It just is.  If you don't know its a great movie then you must have been living under a rock for 50 years or so.  We bought it & were so pleased to see that Amazon included a special feature not previously mentioned on the website (or maybe we just missed it).  There's a lengthy segment about the history of How the Grinch Stole Christmas!  It is like a documentary about how it came to be.  We loved every minute of it!  Thank you so much Amazon!  This is even more reason to buy this & praise Amazon for their wonderful service.  You gotta love that Thurl Ravenscroft for his lyrical cynical voice in the song.

This is a great movie for young children---not too long,  interesting, nice little moral and sweet songs!  Love it.",1386374400,,386,5.031746031746032

928689,3,6304698771,"Large package with long list of movies, unfortunately the movies themselves are lacking.

This is definitely an item that I had great interest in. There always seems to be room for more holiday classics. The video quality is great for what it is but unfortunately the specials themselves just really aren't the greatest.

The movies you get here are:

How the Grinch Stole Christmas

 - This is a fantastic classic

The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold

 - This is definitely a weird one. It is cute but it is very short. It was nice to have Art Carney in this one

Pinocchios Christmas

 - This story has many of the familiar characters from the original story. It is lacking in charm but has a few bright moments. There just might be a reason that you have never heard of this Christmas special.

The Stingiest Man in Town

- This one is an introductory Scrooge story. This could be a nice way of getting kids to enjoy this story before moving in to the heavy hitters that really mastered the dickens tale.

The Year Without a Santa Clause

-  This is one of the better movies on this set. This story has gotten a lot of play on TV in recent years. This is definitely a fun watch.

Rudolph's Shiny New Year

- This story tries to recapture the magic of the original Rudolph. It tries very hard to introduce quirky characters but is only mildly successful. It does start off right where the original ended which is a nice touch.

Nestor The Long Eared Donkey

- This sort has a much more religious take to it than most of the others. This is about a Rudolph-like character that is around for the birth of Jesus Christ.

Frosty Winter Wonderland

- This is a continued story of frosty the snowman and it is a lot of fun. This animated film is not a classic but is an enjoyable ride.

'Twas The Night Before Christmas

-  This might just be me but I feel that this is one of the most memorable movies on this set. The story is good and the characters are fun. The story is about a group of mice trying to dave Christmas. The description sounds very generic but it is a very enjoyable story.

Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July

- This might be a case of the people who made this trying a little bit too hard. The story is confusing and I'm not sure how well kids would be able to follow along. The real highlight of this movie is being able to see frosty animated with stop motion animation.

This is an acceptable set of movies. There is a lot of value when you consider how many movies you are getting, but the quality of the content of these films is relatively low.

If you are interested in this set I would first go with the set titled ""The Original Classics.""",1382486400,68,2664,4.325252525252525

Three cheers for cds then - my own kids love it just as much, and get to watch it whenever they want. If you've actually managed to make it to adulthood without seeing it, do yourself a favor and get a copy! Nothing beats the Grinch for a simple holiday story with a great Christmas message that is neither preachy, sappy, nor religious (though you can give it that bent if that's your thing.)

Horton Hears a Who is a nice addition. While not actually 'holiday' in setting, it's still got a strong message about peace, love and brotherhood, so it does tie in. My kids love this one too.",1358467200,,724,4.246376811594203

What I was disappointed in was that while they included How the Grinch stole Christmas I wished they would of included Horton Hears a Who. I understand Horton Hears a Who isn't exactly a Christmas movie but it has always played after How The Grinch Stole Christmas and that is just disappointing. Also I don't understand why they chose to include Frosty's Winter Wonderland instead of the original Frosty The Snowman but but that's just being picky.

928862,3,6304698771,"the 4 am police buzzing of my house like most days, bloomberg and kelly stole another christmas not even giving me a day off from the harrassment.. oh right they have the whole world convinced that 24 7 police survellince is necessary no not of serial killer or terrorist of a super of a building . yes Im sure the Nazi had the germans convinced it was for security at first when they started to abuse the gypsies in berlin and the mentally ill in prague

Bloombergs gun control lets see if I covered up 9/11 gased peoples kids by lying about air quality , covered up the subprime great depression closed several hospitals
backed every evil republcan Nazi Neocon policy I too would want guns banned like Koch he was another Tyrant worried about his tyranny.. Koch made lots of poor marginal people homeless Im sure anyone of them would have liked to have lunch with Koch and a few pounds of steel..

anyway thanks NY I couldn't travel this past year was slandered overseas couldn't find a wife couldn't make any friends have no reason to live more reasons to die to avoid being abused mentally and slandered more by the NYPD and FDNY.. to stop the pain of being ostracized so no one wil be freinds with me. but just laugh

I cant believe there is not one person on the planet who is at all a critic of Nazi NYPD to expose this evil  not one person on the planet who would prevent a death or perosn from being homeless not one Michael Moore type or taylor swift type..

Eveyone on the planet believes that this death sentence is the only solution? this daily torture is the only way for me to live? this Truman show torture?

NYPD will read this and FDNY and say hey we have to step up harramsnet because this guy is crazy.

NYC is socially and geopoliticaly and by business part of the european trade block
doesnt mean we all have to live by gypsy torture , gypsy murder rules. There are lots of decent europeans we don't have to be the mean ones that start wars and torture at the drop of a hat for entertainment.

You know why russia is Nazi?? its becasue of Milton Freidman.. his policies are basically a road map for facist and nazi politics..  and reagan and bush and bloomberg are all Nazi they all have adopted Friedman politics and economics.

This is why oprah and Matt damaon and bill moyers are all Nazi's and why I cant afford to get my teeth fixed or pay for stem therapy for my tinnitus .. they kept the bush tax cuts and took the bloomberg cut to services.. this makes them Nazi's .

a quiet politically correct Nazism.. Oprah has 5 billions reasons to prove she is a Nazi. Taylor Swift has 1 billion, sure she is a compassionate Nazi and so on but still if you prosper by Nazi polictis and economics you are a Nazi.

so Heil Heil Heil..

also the door man is a Nazi he supports this regime.. so when you wonder why your homeless or jobless just look to the Nazi liberal progessive like Gary Null or Tim DOlan and realize the Nazis cheated you out of it and stole it..  then they will offer a band aid and a kind word to cover up there Nazism...

anyone of these liberal progressive could have worked to put a communist on the city council and socialist in state legilature.. a green party in mayors office..

so did they? at all ??? lift a finger no no no we get a brain dead moron like bill deblasio and a governemnt whore like scott stringer this is who Bono and Mick Jagger give we the people to govern us.. Incompetent Nazi morons and then complain about bush or some poor child in africa...

ask Dolan ask Menachum Smernoff why do you push Nazi right wing kooks into politics .. Duh we are Nazis and facists and like to see the masses suffer.. we like it when bloomberg closes hosipitals in his necessary 3rd term....

one thing that is interesting about bloombergs health care policy might prove that too many doctors in one area means more people die. He closes hosptials and mortality rates drop , which has been proven the reason being that doctors want people to be sick.. psychiatirsts whant people to be crazy.. and bloomberg pushed personal responsiblity of health banny transfats and smoking which is really the only way to stayp healthy...but it overlooks the fact the the natinal average has been going up also..

His policies have pretty much followed the Fox news pattern..good on health care Nazi everywhere else a jewish bill oreilly",1356393600,,4369,4.418430884184309

Except for the Grinch and year w/o a Santa Claus, the rest of these ""specials"" will remind you why you turned off the TV when you were 8.  Let's face it not all Rankin Bass oldies were goodies.

This is a huge annoyance as I paid for the movie and I don't want to listen to your lies.  I have my own opinions and your brainwashing garbage does not belong on DVDs targeted at childgren.  No matter how great the material, having this on it actually encourages piracy.  You are insane to think that it will actually make people pirate the content less.  This is exactly the kind of thing that makes people like me angry enough to not buy your products.  I like commercials for other DVDs and I don't mind that at all (make it skippable though).  I understand the FBI warning etc. and really that's more than enough (still BS though).  I've got a large DVD collection and I prefer physical media and the ease of purchase with buying them.  I give this collection 4 stars but I think the money grubbing movie studios need to wake up and stop punishing their true audience for the actions of others.  I'm not a pirate, I purchase my movies so stop treaing me like a criminal!  Would have given 5 stars without the anti piracy junk.  Movie execs are grinches.",1324512000,2,1147,4.48792270531401

929165,5,6304698771,"I read the reviews warning that this set might have the wrong ""The Year Without A Santa Claus"" movie, but decided to take a chance anyway.  Either the problem with packaging the wrong movie has been fixed or we got lucky.  Our set has all the classic movies the package advertises.

One funny thing though - the description on the back of the package for The Year Without a Santa Claus says: ""When Santa decides to retire one Christmas, Mrs. Claus takes action. Baby New Year is missing - and a certain red-nosed reindeer leads the search. And a kind-hearted burro, mocked for his ears, takes a special journey to Bethlehem.""

Apparently in China, they have finally figured out the difference between John Goodman and the Heat Miser, but they can't get the descriptions for Year Without a Santa Claus, Rudolph's Shiny New Year and Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey straight.

The four disks included have these movies:
Disk 1
Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!
The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold
Pinocchio's Christmas
The Stingiest Man in Town

Disk 2
The Year Without a Santa Claus (Deluxe Edition)
Rudolph's Shiny New Year

Disk 4

929166,5,6304698771,"We just bought this DVD in Dec. 2010, and it appears that many of the old complaints from former reviews have been fixed.

1)Shrink wrap: some had complained their sets were not shrink wrapped. Ours came shrink wrapped.
2)Wrong Disk: many have said they got the wrong disk for The Year Without a Santa Claus. Ours was the correct disk. Also, the photo above in the product description that shows the wrong disk included and states that only 7 classics are included is correct, but only if you get the wrong disk, since 3 of the classics are on that disk. With the correct disk, you get all 10 classics as advertised.
3)Voices out of sync: some said the voices on Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July were out of sync with the motion. Ours seems to be completely in sync.
4)Little Drummer Boy II: some people have complained that the DVD has a trailer at the beginning of the first disk that lists Little Drummer Boy II as one of the extras on the disk, instead of Pinocchio's Christmas. Our disk does show that promo, and it does say Little Drummer Boy II, but does not mention Pinocchio. The set actually comes with Pinocchio's Christmas, instead of The Little Drummer Boy.

As far as #4 goes, I don't care because the product description, the box and the DVD labels all state that you get the Pinocchio feature, and nothing mentions The Little Drummer Boy II. The only way this could cause problems is if I liked the drummer boy feature better and got buyer's remorse after the fact. However, I had never seen either show, so it didn't matter. Also, I could only have found out about this issue after buying and watching the DVD, which clearly states on the box that the Pinocchio feature is included, so I still got what I paid for.

My only complaint is that the Amazon description above states that How the Grinch Stole Christmas includes the feature Horton Hears a Who. Ours did not include that feature. This does not affect the value of the set, as Horton was not one of the 10 classics the DVD advertises. I was hoping to get that feature, though, so it bummed me out a little. The product packaging itself does not state that Horton is included, so this is something Amazon needs to correct, I think. Also, my set included a trailer for a release of Horton to DVD with a few other Seuss features, so perhaps WB removed Horton from the latest release of this DVD set, in order to sell the new Horton DVD set.

Overall, I think it is a great set, everything works, and it seems like they corrected the old issues people had. I think it is safe for anyone who likes these shows to buy this set. Just make sure you read which shows are included, as many are 'sequels' and not the original Rudolph, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, etc. I was going to give it 4 stars due to the Horton missing issue, but I think that is more an Amazon error than WB's, and I wanted to offset the much older, extremely harsh reviews.",1292889600,,2921,4.4037037037037035

929168,5,6304698771,"First, since many of the reviews from last year mention getting the wrong disc, I will say that I received the right one in Dec. 2010. Either they fixed the problem, or I got lucky.

The movies are good quality transfers, with some special features thrown is as well.

I bought this for two reasons: ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and ""The Year without a Santa Claus."" I have seen these fairly recently, so there were no surprises there. The other shows in the set I had either never seen, or had not seen since I was a young child in the late '70s/early '80s. Without nostalgia, they don't hold up well. Particularly if you aren't Christian, as several - particularly ""Nestor the Long eared Donkey"" - are very religious (and yet somewhat sacrilegious at the same time, it was a weird era in pop culture).

If you are already a fan of these shows, the boxed set is a great value. If you haven't seen them yet, I recommend watching them yourself before showing them to your children.",1292457600,,984,4.4860335195530725
929169,4,6304698771,"I received this DVD as a gift from my sister last year.  On first glance, it looks like a great bargain--the twenty dollar price gets you FOUR discs packed with 10 holiday ""favorites"" as well as various extras.  In reality, however, this set contains only two true Christmas TV special classics:  the original ""Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,"" and ""The Year Without a Santa Claus,"" a title that is sometimes forgotten but a show that is always remembered because it features the memorable characters Snow Miser and Heat Miser.  So, for these two specials alone, I think that this DVD set is a good buy.  (NOTE:  my product, which was purchased in 2009, definitely DOES contain the correct version of ""The Year Without a Santa Claus,"" NOT the live-action version with John Goodman that some other reviewers have mentioned receiving.)

But this DVD set actually does have a few other things to offer.  As mentioned above, it includes extras in addition to the shows themselves.  I found the GRINCH bonus materials to be particularly enjoyable (of course, this IS my favorite Christmas special!), which included an interview with Thurl Ravenscroft, who sang the Grinch's theme song (and was best-known as the voice of Tony the Tiger).  Also, I found some of the unfamiliar shows to be okay, such as ""The Stingiest Man in Town,"" a take on the Scrooge classic (and narrated by Tom Bosley, which I found somewhat poignant since he recently passed away). In addition, I always kind of liked the sweet but seldom-seen ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas,"" which appears on Disc 3; this story pairs up a wayward mouse and a man who fixes clocks to save Christmas.

This DVD set does NOT offer either the original ""Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" or ""Frosty the Snowman"" Christmas specials; I personally didn't have a problem with this, as I have never particularly liked either of those two shows.  However, fans of Rudolph and/or Frosty might enjoy some of the other specials which ARE included in this compilation, such as ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year,"" ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland,"" and the feature-length ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July.""

The one classic special that I do feel is missing from this set is ""A Charlie Brown Christmas.""  Otherwise, I would recommend this DVD.",1292457600,3,2286,4.934725848563969

When i opened the case to pull out the Christmas classic, it was NOT the classic year without a Santa Claus but instead the movie made after 2000 with John Goodman. I have no idea how this grave error occurred.  I never even thought about checking the dvd's for accuracy, when the case stated it was the 1974 classic.

929244,4,6304698771,"Like many people who have written reviews on this, one of the main reasons that I bought it was to get the stop-action-animated Rankin-Bass THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.

800-553-6937.

They say that a new YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS (the right one) is coming.  All I have to do is send back the Goodman version in the pre-paid envelope that they're sending.  Obviously, this is on the honor system, but I'm happy to send it back.

As for the others, you'll be quite happy.  The other seldom-seen gem is 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  (When was the last time this was on nationally broadcast teevee?)  It's one of my all-time favorites because of the fantastic lesson.

When you've done something wrong, you have to fix it.""

His trip down the mountain when he's heading for Whoville and his trip home are funny.

This DVD also has Horton Hears A Who!, narrated by Hans Conrad.

929332,5,6304698771,"How The Grinch Stole Christmas is twenty-five minutes and seventeen seconds long and originally aired on December 18, 1966. The main story is that the Grinch has been living on the mountain for over a half a century and can no longer stand the people down in Whoville celebrating Christmas; mainly he can't stand the noise, noise, noise. He gets an awful idea when he sees his dog Max covered in snow in a Santa Clause like way. So he quickly makes a quick Santa suit and hat. Since reindeers are scarce he ties a branch to Max's head and quickly gathers up some bags and put them on a sled and the two head to Whoville. Once in Whoville the Grinch still everything that has to do with the Christmas holiday. He almost gets away with it when Cindy Lou Who (who is no more then two) comes out from here bedroom to investigate a noise. She spots Santa taking the Christmas tree and asks why Santa. The Grinch thinks of a quick lie and gives Cindy a glass of water and send her to her room. The Grinch finish his job and takes all the full bags to the top of Mount Crumpit. Once at the top of the mountain the Grinch put a hand to his ear to hear all the people in Whoville cry boo hoo. Instead he hears the people of Whoville sing Welcome Christmas and is puzzled that Christmas came. After some deep thoughts the true meaning of Christmas comes to the Grinch and the Grinch returns all the Christmas decorations. The Whoville, who seem to be very forgiving, allow the Grinch to cut and serve the roast beast.

Also included in this DVD is the animated special is Horton Hears A Who is twenty-five minutes long and released in 1970. One day Horton is splashing in the lake when he hears a noise and begins looking around and sees a small speck floating in the air saying help. He rescues the small speck and strikes up a conversation with Dr. H. Hoovey. Later on Jane Kangaroo sees Horton talking to a flower and think he is nuts. She goes out of her way to put a stop to it. Her first attempt is foil when Horton finds the flower among the millions of other flowers that it was dropped into. In Jane Kangaroo second attempt she secures the Wickersham family aid (a bunch of monkey\apes) and they put Horton in a cage and try to destroy the speck in a pot of boiling water. Dr. H. Hoovey gathers all of the people of Whoville to yell to save their world. The people scream: We Are Here Finally one boy yells yolp and everyone hears the townsfolk and Horton is set free. In a way this is sort of social issues to it. How the small voice of a minority is put down by ignorant people on the majority. Both How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Horton Hears a Who gets an AAA+++.

929396,5,6304698771,"Well, this review is long overdue, as many folks have asked me to follow up after my review of the ""Original Christmas Classics"" set, so here goes. First up though, I want to say that this ""Classic Christmas Favorites"" set from Warner Home Video (2008) IS supposed to have the classic stop-motion version of ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"", and NOT the live-action remake starring John Goodman. Apparently, since a lot of folks have complained about this, it seems many people have gotten this set with the wrong version. Amazing, since the original is clearly featured on the packaging. All I can do is speculate here that Warner had tons of those live-action DVDs lying around and were trying to get rid of them, ha, but maybe it was just an innocent but careless mistake. Regardless, as another reviewer has suggested, you can simply call Warner Customer Support, and they'll send you the correct DVD, and if you're lucky, they won't even ask you to send the other one back (which means you get a freebie, which is pretty sweet). I don't want to steal that other reviewer's thunder since they originally posted about this, so simply locate their review for the phone number.

Now, if you were lucky and got the RIGHT ""Year Without a Santa Claus"" disc, you SHOULD be very happy, as this is an excellent set loaded with classic holiday specials, and even some extras!

Disc 1 features one of the all-time greatest animated programs, the 1966 holiday classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". This Chuck Jones directed masterpiece, overseen by Dr. Seuss himself, with the voices of Boris Karloff, June Foray, and Thurl Ravenscroft, is a Christmas MUST. Now, I actually like the Jim Carrey version, but it is no substitute for the original. If you are shockingly unfamiliar with it, this is the story of a grouchy, green creature who hates Christmas and decides to dress up as Santa Claus and ""steal"" it, essentially coming down chimneys and taking everyone's trees, presents, food, and decorations to dump off a mountaintop out of pure spite. That is, until he discovers there is more to Christmas than gifts, noise, and gluttony. A true worldwide favorite, and this version shouldn't be too scary for kiddies, ha.

Also on Disc 1 are, count 'em, three other Christmas specials, plus the bulk of the set's bonus features (since most are about the Grinch). The other three specials are all from those holiday maestros, Rankin and Bass, the guys who brought us the original Rudolph and Frosty TV classics (found in the ""Original Christmas Classics"" set). Here, we have ""The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold"", ""Pinocchio's Christmas"", and ""The Stingiest Man In Town"". These three are all entertaining, but a bit more forgettable (story-wise, at least) as Rankin/Bass holiday specials go. ""The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold"" (1981, stop-motion ""animagic"") isn't that much about Christmas and could easily have been written as a Saint Patrick's Day special. Perhaps that was the original idea, and they just fell under network or reputation pressure to work-in the Christmas aspect. I don't know, but basically it's a fun little story about leprechauns and a young sailor trying to prevent a banshee from stealing taking their Christmas gold. Some folks have complained that its a story that doesn't have the Christmas spirit, as the banshee requires the gold to stay alive and the leprechauns are just being greedy by not giving it to her, and I can see the point of such complaints, but if you are able to look past that and just enjoy the rarity of a leprechaun story, it's entertaining enough. ""Pinocchio's Christmas"" (1980, stop-motion ""animagic"") is similar to Leprechauns in that it could have just been a Pinocchio story, but they worked Christmas into it. The special is basically a series of Pinocchio-type adventures started by Pinocchio wanting to buy Geppetto a Christmas gift. Like in the original Pinocchio story, he is tricked repeatedly by the Fox and Cat, ends up in the hands of a mean puppeteer, etc... If you like Pinocchio stories, you'll like this one. And finally, ""The Stingiest Man In Town"" (1978) is Rankin Bass's rather straightforward, traditionally animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"", AKA ""Scrooge"". As I understand it, it's a remake of a live-action musical version from 1956, but this special is told by a B.A.H. Humbug, a literal bug (voiced by Tom Bosley), which I doubt was the case in the live-action Basil Rathbone version. The wonderful extras on Disc 1 are, as I mentioned, all Grinch-related. There's that wonderful ""Making-Of"" special that I remember seeing on TNT, hosted by the always hilarious Phil Hartman, whom we all greatly miss. There's also a featurette on the music of the Grinch (Songs in the Key of Grinch), a nice Seuss featurette (Dr. Seuss and the Grinch - From Whoville to Hollywood), text bios, an actual commentary track with voice actress Jun Foray (Cindy Lou Who) and Animator Phil Roman, and what are described as pencil tests but simply appear to be three production art drawings from the special.

Disc 2 is the much talked about ""Year Without a Santa Claus"" disc so many people have been getting the wrong version of. If your set holds the correct version, the featured special will be the old ""animagic"" (stop-motion) version from Rankin/Bass, 1974. This program is one of the big Rankin/Bass holiday classics to most people, most famous for the Heat Miser/Snow Miser musical number. Personally, for some reason, this one never was a tradition for me, as I just don't remember it being aired yearly as a kid. When I was an older kid, it would get multiple airings, but I never caught it. I guess I never really sat and watched it until I got this set. It's a cute and original little story, but for me it's no Rudolph, Frosty, or Santa Claus is Coming to Town. I can see myself possibly forming a new attachment to it though, but I digress. ""Year Without a Santa Claus"" is about Santa catching a cold and not wanting to go out on his yearly rounds one Christmas, long ago. The real problem, though, seems to be that Santa has gotten the impression that people no longer really care if he visits or not. Mrs. Claus considers making the rounds herself, but instead sends two elves on a mission to find proof that people still believe in Santa and care about him coming on Christmas Eve. This leads to other complications in which Mrs. Claus must try to make a deal with the Miser Brothers to allow it to snow in a place called Southtown to restore the belief in Santa Claus there. Lots of great music and fun in this classic special, to be sure. And that's not all of the great stuff on Disc 2. There are two more specials AND some bonus features!

The other two specials on Disc 2 are ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" and ""Nestor, The Long-Eared Christmas Donkey"", both in the ""animagic"" medium. The first is, for me at least, a true classic. I loved this one AT LEAST as much as the original Rudolph. Clearly, he was Rankin/Bass's little star/hero, and in this unforgettable New Year's special from 1976, Rudolph is sent on a mission to find the missing Baby New Year, Happy. Rudolph must find little Happy in time for the new year, but also before the monster-bird Eon the Terrible finds him first! Yeah, Eon was actually pretty scary when I was a little kid! This one is full of neat characters and fun adventure as Rudolph and new friends that he meets along the way search over a cluster of magical islands that represent past years. This is the special that introduces the whale, Big Ben, with the big clock in his tail, and the camel, The Great Quarter Past Five, with the big clock for a hump, ha, along with the caveman, One Million, the Knight, Sir Ten-To-Three, Seventeen Seventy Six, Father Time, and even the three bears! Father Time is the storyteller, as Rankin/Bass always seems to have one of those, and is voiced by Red Skelton (looks like him too). As for ""Nestor, The Long-Eared Donkey"" (1977), you may not have heard of this one before, or you may easily confuse it with other specials, but Nestor (narrated by Roger Miller, playing a donkey descendant of Nestor) is the story of a little donkey with ridiculously long ears. Need I say more? Yes, it's like Rudolph or Dumbo, a character made fun of for a physical oddity that pays off in the end. It's not the best or most original special, but some may appreciate this one at least for its focus on the Nativity Story, as Nestor ends up being the donkey that carries Mary to Bethlehem. You may take issue with that if you are a big ""Small One"" fan, like myself, but, oh, well. Nestor is a cute little critter too, so there's that as well, and we get to see Santa and co. gathered around a manger display in the end, which is lovely if you'd like to see Santa acknowledging the true meaning of Christmas in a special for a change of pace. On to the bonus features of Disc 2 though. There are two featurettes, both of which are pretty nice. One is ""We Are Santa's Elves"", which is about Rankin/Bass (with emphasis on Year Without a Santa Claus, I'd say), and the other is ""Stop Motion 101"", which is all about the process of Stop Motion Animation. Good stuff!

Disc Three holds two more great holiday specials. In fact, these are two favorites of mine in particular. Both are traditionally animated and from Rankin/Bass. I generally prefer their animagic stuff, but these and the original Frosty are the ones I make the exception for. They are simply delightful. First up is the TRUE Frosty sequel, 1976's ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"", narrated by an animated Andy Griffith. In the story, Frosty comes back to town to have fun with the kids again (sadly, a favorite character of mine, little Karen, is not part of this story, though I've heard she can be seen in one scene and I need to check on that). However, the children notice that when they have to go in for the night, Frosty gets lonely (well, he basically tells them). So, they end up building him a wife. I always say this, but why he decides on a frozen Shelly Winters is beyond me. I'd make a snow-Elisabeth Harnois or a snow-Hilary Duff, or something more along those lines. Call me superficial (but call me). Anyway, things work out until Jack Frost gets jealous of Frosty's popularity. It's a wonderful and original little sequel from R/B, with a simple and charming story and reasonably good continuity with the first (returning voices and close-enough art, etc...), unlike the two most recent attempts at 2D Frosty sequels (Frosty Returns and The Legend of Frosty the Snowman). Unfortunately, don't expect to ever find this one coupled with the original special, since, as I understand it, WB's ownership of Rankin/Bass titles only includes the 1974-1989 titles (minus ""The Last Unicorn""). So, I just recommend getting this boxed set and the ""Original Christmas Classics"" set, as I did. Continuing, the second special on Disc Three is 1974's ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"", and it's the tale of a town with a problem. A ""forward-thinking"" young mouse scripts an anonymous letter that gets printed in the newspaper and simply explains that Santa Claus does not exist. This, of course, offends Santa and the townspeople become concerned that he will not visit them this year. A musical town clock is commissioned to be built that will sing praises of Santa when it chimes, but the little mouse (who lives in the clock maker's own home) mucks that up as well. It's a great story of making mistakes, learning from them, and working hard to put them right, and just a delightful little Christmas story that ends with the telling of the classic poem of the same name. Both of these fine specials are a must for any Christmas Special-lover's collection.

Finally, we come to Disc 4, which holds the feature film (yes, theatrically released), ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July"". It's from 1979, and the great part is that it brings Rudolph and Frosty together, explained here as best-friends, with their original voices and with Frosty's wife Crystal too (voiced again by Shelly Winters). Mickey Rooney returns as Santa (whom he played in ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" and ""Year Without a Santa Claus""), and we get to see Frosty's kids as well! Plus, Jack Frost and Big Ben make an appearance! So, it's like a great crossover flick for hardcore Rankin/Bass fans! This was one of two attempts Rankin/Bass made at doing animagic feature films, the other being ""Mad Monster Party"", which I recommend for a Halloween R/B fix. The negative on this one is that, well, Christmas in July itself is kind of a bunk concept. Do you watch this at Christmas, or in July? I think I vote Christmas though. The story is pretty interesting though, and it provides a detailed backstory on Rudolph's special light. The villain is a warlock named Winterbolt, who returns to take back control of the North, but first he must defeat its new ruler, Santa Claus. He decides to do this with a storm, but feels he first must get Rudolph and his light-up nose out of the way. When he learns that Rudolph will lose his glow if he ever uses it for an act of evil, he arranges some trickery to cause Rudolph to help in a robbery without knowing it. He also manipulates Frosty and family in his further scheming to gain power. This all happens at the worst time for the Frosties, as they, along with Rudolph, are out of their cold-weather element (thanks to magic amulets) helping a circus put on a Christmas in July themed show. Red Buttons and Ethel Merman also star. Some have called this film's story a bit bleak since the major characters come into some pretty dark situations, sometimes facing ""death"" (as in, melting or losing your magic hat, in some cases), but I think freaking out about those plot elements is a bit much. Having said that, though, perhaps overall the story is darker than one might expect. The heightened drama was probably because the film was made for theatrical release. Overall, it's a good if not great story, and the big highlight is seeing the Frosties in animagic form and seeing all the characters I mentioned together in one story. For that, it's another Rankin/Bass fan Must-Own.

So, that's the ""Classic Christmas Favorites"" DVD set in a nutshell. It's a very solid collection of holiday greats I highly recommend. Get the ""Original Christmas Classics"" set first, but definitely follow-up with this one (or get them at the same time, duh). It's terrible about the swapped disc issue for Year Without a Santa Claus, but just make sure to call Warner Customer Support if your set holds the live-action version instead. They should set you up with the right one, and then you'll be thrilled with this wonderful collection.",1263340800,,14721,4.731982859368913

So I went into this one with low expectations, and the highlight for me was to see Frosty done in animagic stop motion rather than as a cartoon.  I was totally unprepared for how dark this story was.  Yes, there were some scary moments in the original Rudolf, but there threats in other stories to the characters always seem to be no greater than Christmas being canceled.  This special features Santa and Mrs. Claus saying their final goodbyes to each other while trapped in the eye of a hurricane, Rudolf having to take blame for a theft he didn't commit to save Frosty and his family from being melted down, and later he is being booed out of the circus by children because his nose doesn't glow anymore, A chilling scene where Mrs/ Frosty tells her children to be brave as they face death by melting (and yes the worst does happen) Frosty committing what amount to snowman suicide by surrendering his magic hat to the villain to save his friend Rudolf's nose-and his family crying over his lifeless body while their mother begs the kids to ""remember him as he was""....This just isn't fun.  It's bleak.  Yes everything comes out OK in the end, but that doesn't excuse our having to suffer through it.  Am I being too sensitive?  Perhaps, but I know the emotions of a child will feel all of this even more strongly.  I want to forget that this one was ever made.",1261699200,3,1752,4.607717041800643

BTW, I went to Target and for some reason the copies of this set are not shrink-wrapped. I looked in them all and confirmed they all contain the incorrect version of disc two.

The specials I bought the set for are The Grinch, The Night Before Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year and The Year Without a Santa Claus. Those are all classics and are great.

The Stingiest Man In Town is a heavily edited, poorly animated version of A Christmas Carol, Pinochios Christmas is OK. Forsty's Winter Wonderland is fun and is the only true sequal to the original. Frosty And Rudolph's Christmas In July is kind of hard to watch.

An earlier reviewer spoke the same sentiment in asking what has become of ""The Little Drummer Boy--Part 2"", and one of my most-awaited titles, ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"".  Certainly there aren't any DVD copies of them available.

Where is the Angela Lansbury 1975 classic, ""(The First Christmas): The Story of the First Christmas Snow""?  I caught it on television last month and was delighted by it, particularly as I'd never seen it before and am a long-time devotee of all Rankin/Bass holiday productions.

But when I attempted to find it on DVD, I was met with the same absolute dearth of product as when I had looked for ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" in 2007.

It's preposterous that the Warner company keeps re-packaging the ""mainstream"", if you will, specials, such as the latter-day Rudolph stories (""Shiny New Year"" and ""Christmas in July"").  I actually have not seen any of the three newly-released titles contained in this compilation (""Leprechauns' Christmas Gold"", ""Pinocchio's Christmas"", and ""The Stingiest Man In Town"").

Everything here is an absolute classic and if you don't have them already, then you definitely should.  ""Classic Christmas Favorites"" is a convenient and affordable way to pick them all up at an affordable price.

The problem is that this set continues an unfortunate practice of re-selling old material with a splash of new material that is available no where else, meaning that people who bought the previous releases are forced to buy them all over again if they want the other films.  There is no way to buy the new material separately

These are the exact same disks that you would have received before, with even the disk cover art intact.

The new material is included on the ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" disk.  This is an odd choice, as this is the only non-Rankin/Bass release and of course, this Dr. Seuss treasure has seen a variety of releases, including a recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50th-Birthday-Deluxe-Remastered-Edition/dp/B000HA4WDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50th Birthday Deluxe Remastered Edition</a>&nbsp;special edition. Tagged onto the disk are three Rankin Bass rarities, ""The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold"", ""Pinocchio's Christmas"" and ""The Stingiest Man in Town"".  All three are making their first appearance on DVD, and they are really what most people will be buying this set for.  It is great to have them released at last, but I would have preferred an individual DVD.

There are still a few Rankin/Bass Christmas specials that have not had a DVD release, and I fear this being the wave of the future.  The same problem happened with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popeye/dp/B000P296AS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popeye</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B001CTXUTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;cartoons (also by Warner Bros) series until definitive collections were finally released.

929768,5,6304698771,"Dr. (Theodore Geisel) Seuss's story of a mean-spirited creature who discovers the real meaning of the holiday was a lovely story to begin with. But director Chuck Jones's contribution made the story truly poignant.

During the war, the two had collaborated on a series of animated shorts for service men featuring Private Snafu. Afterward, Jones returned to directing those wonderful animated shorts from Warner Brothers and Seuss went on to write a score of children's books. Their reunion produced this seamless blend of heartfelt sentiment refracted through the lens of a Looney Tunes sensibility.

929900,5,6304698771,"""Horton Hears a Who"" is a good introduction to the Who characters, and is typical of Dr. Suess talent for incorporating clever rhyme and cute storytelling. The animation is equal to the story, no complaints.

The reason I purchased this DVD is because of the Grinch.

This is the year my 3-year-old daughter is discovering Christmas, and the Grinch is a focal character in what I hope will become a holiday tradition around here. We've been reading the 1957 edition of the book ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" because it represents the best of Dr. Suess (my opinion) and the MGM cartoon adaptation is clever, cute, and simple in its telling and plotline.

For small children (and for nostalgia saps like me) the 1967 video version of the story is as good as any video interpretation can get. Boris Karloff provides narration and the voice of the Grinch with just the right amount of sneer in his voice, and at the end, Karloff's natural accent describes the transformation of the Grinch perfectly.

Where the Ron Howard live action film is dark and creepy (the Whos look like something from a 1960's ""Twilight Zone"" episode), Chuck Jones' characters are light and colorful, the songs are simple enough for children to enjoy and remember. Thurl Ravenscroft (aside from having a very cool name) sings a great baritone ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"". My daughter pretty much has the book memorized and now she sings ""Welcome Christmas"" in all the right places when she recites the story.

Sorry, but it is kind of sweet.

So, my recommendation is to skip Ron Howard's over-produced, over-analyzed, and, I might add, rather creepy and nightmare-inducing, interpretation of ""The Grinch"" (let's leave the psychological implications Opie Taylor's Grinch to his therapist) and introduce the tots in our lives to something much more palatable for their impressionable young minds.",1198195200,,1873,4.987179487179487
929901,1,6304698771,"I must agree with the reviewer who was complaining about the color of the Grinch.  The Grinch in THIS version is indeed YELLOW, not green.  On the cover of the DVD case, the Grinch is Green.  On the disc itself, the Grinch is Green.  In the actual show, however, the Grinch is definitely YELLOW. Obviously a bad transfer to DVD.  I've put this DVD on several DVD players and it is always YELLOW, so it's this version of the Show, not the DVD players.  This version of the show should have been recalled.  I've heard that the 40-year anniversary edition has the original Green color restored.",1197417600,5,591,4.518867924528302
929902,5,6304698771,"Seuss and Jones, two masters of their crafts, combine here to create one of my favorite works of art, period.

The morals ring truer than ever, the voices are incredible (Karloff is legendary, Carrey's version is nowhere near this), and the artwork is perfection.

This may be the single finest cartoon ever made, all of Bugs B included. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and has as much to offer adults as kids, maybe more in our incredibly selfish world. Seuss's take on pathetic Xmas commercialization gets truer every year. Watching this on tv surrounded by ads is one of the great modern ironic experiences.

Much better to just get this dvd. Paired with Horton, one of Seuss's other completely genius works, there's more enlightenment for your kid here in less than an hour than s/he'll get in a year of normal entertainment (or should I say marketing? Kids' stuff now is all one big ad, if it was ever otherwise). What Christmas cartoon would Jesus watch? The Grinch, no question. Might be tough to work the remote, though.

Grinch and Horton make so many deep comments on our culture and our species while looking gorgeously unique. Plus, they're as fun as they can be.

929944,5,6304698771,"The 1966 cartoon version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" has rightly become a Christmas season classic.  Its simple but evocative storyline is brought to life by the pairing of animator Chuck Jones with original artist Theodor Geisel.  Boris Karloff's absolutely superb narration is the thing of genius that makes the whole movie work.

The story is familar to anyone who has been young in the last forty years: The Grinch, a Christmas-hater, lives near Whoville, populated by Whos, a cheery bunch who celebrate Christmas with abandon.  The Grinch has the stoke of awful inspiration one Christams Eve to sneak into Whoville and steal all the holiday paraphanalia, and stop Christmas from coming.  Disguised as Santa Claus, the Grinch makes away with all the presents, decorations, and food, only to discover that he has missed the point about Christmas altogether.  His moment of relevation may be the highlight of the whole movie.

929945,4,6304698771,"I bought this DVD primarily to get Horton Hears A Who. It has been several years since I have watched this show. I don't even remember how old I was when I first saw this show. It has been maybe 20 years. I was very pleased to see it being sold in the animated version. For me, it brings back a youthful experience. My children have shared in the experience. If you have small children, it may be different for them because of the animation we have today, but they just may enjoy a simple cartoon with a purposeful message.

The message seems to be simple; that even little children can make a difference in the world around them. They are needed, no matter how young, or as Horton says, ""...no matter how small"". I'm sure that different people get different messages.

It has been wonderful seeing this show again.

I had read Seuss as a child in the public libraries but this was the first time I had a chance to see the animated versions.

The picture quality has been restored very well here on this DVD however the sound quality while is good at Dolby Digital Stereo quality is not remastered well enough coming without any DTS with THX or Dolby 5.1 option although whose of you with Pro Logic would have it a little better.  This becomes apparent especially for the second great feature: ""Horton Hears a Who"" where the volume levels alternate from just right to too soft at various points of the cartoon.

The special features here are very, very good with documentaries featuring great interviews with the voice talents and the composer Albert Hague who wrote the great music for the songs on the Grinch.  Overall, this is a very good DVD of great value for money and I can only anticipate what a better restored version with enhanced sound quality perhaps on Blu-ray would look like and I await such a DVD with bated breath.  In the meantime though, this DVD is still a very good tribute to that great classic, the original and still the best version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!""

Here's a short little book report for those of you who haven't seen it yet- the Grinch gets tired of the Who's enjoying Christmas and decides to take away all their Christmas joy.  So with his dog, Max, he comes down from his hill while the Who's are all sleeping.  Disguised as Santa Claus, the Grinch steals all their stuff for the Christmas celebration, in hopes that will stop Christmas from coming.  Will it?  5 stars

Also included is Horton Hears a Who, a lesser known special which dates back to 1970.  Horton was also co-directed by Dr. Seuss and Chuck Jones.  Although not quite as good as The Grinch (no, not the live action movie of 2000!), it's fun and quirky and teaches the lesson of valuing all people- ""because, after all, a person's a person no matter how small!""  Horton the Elephant tries hard to relay this message to a snooty kangaroo and the 3 ornery Wickersham brothers.  To answer the question one reviewer asked ""Wasn't this released by Warner Brothers in a short cartoon?""  No, it wasn't.  That cartoon he's probably thinking of is Horton Hatches the Egg.  4 and 1/2 stars for Horton Hears a Who.

Extras include pencil tests by Chuck Jones (2 stars, only worth seeing once!), commentary on the Grinch by animator Phil Roman and June Foray (2 and 1/2 stars, Roman speaks on who's who in animation and Foray speaks on what an honor it was to have only one line in the special and neither of them can even remember what year it came out!), interviews with Hague and Ravenscroft (3 stars) and saving the best extra for last, a 1994 TNT special about How the Grinch Stole Christmas, with interviews by all involved, including an old interview with the late great Dr. Seuss and many from Audrey Geisel, the widow of Dr. Seuss, hosted by the late great Phil Hartman, Saturday Night Live comedian (5 stars).

Tunes: The guy who does the voice of Tony the Tiger (recently deceased, R.I.P) sings the Grinch's theme song. It isn't the only cool song here, you also get the TRIM UP THE TREE with who foo fluff song. Also the BA BOO BORIN song, which in my house, this song pretty much establishes that its officially ""Christmas time.""

Toys: KLUM DUM DINGERS and WAZAMA WOOS. Yeah, I made that up.. lets go smoke some WHO HASH! You know what I'm saying?

THE GRINCH: Conceived by Dr. SEUSS and brought to the small screen by Chuck Jones. Two genius' for sure, who worked together once before when they brought Horton Hatches the Egg to the silver screen sometime back in the forties. They would also produce HORTON HEARS A WHO in later years, that too can be found on this DVD. But the Grinch, is his own. Nothing can stop him (except maybe the love of Christmas, but as we know this really only made him stronger.) The Grinch is probably the coolest cartoon character around (and I watch a lot of cartoons.)

My 26 month old granddaughter really enjoys watching this(three times in a row)the first day we bought it. A added bonus is Horton Hears A Who which is not the greatest but is OK,although if you have a very young child who gets scared easily or is very sensitive you may want to skip the Horton episode. It has some creepy looking monkey brothers,an almost boiled in oil scene and Horton is roped and caged. Kiersten did watch Horton and was OK with it and asked to watch it a second time.

An annual holiday classic for the whole family to enjoy for generations. Karloff has one of the greatest voices ever heard and is the best source to hear it, this unforgetable animated special. the holidays are coming sooner than you think, buy this DVD",1131840000,,482,5.0375
930059,5,6304698771,"One of only a handful of essential, ""must-see"" animated Christmas classics, How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a Dr. Seuss holiday masterpiece. Created in 1966 on the heels of the phenomenal success surrounding such TV specials as A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964), the Grinch has morphed into a sacred annual Christmas rite perfect for any child from one to ninety-two.

How The Grinch Stole Christmas tells the story of a lumbering green monster who has a heart seven-sizes-to-small. Living with his dog in a mountaintop cave high above the town of Whoville, the Grinch (voiced by Boris Karloff) hates all the Whos, but what he hates worst of all is their happiness and celebration at Christmas. So the Grinch (smiling an evil Grinch grin) hatches a plan to steal Christmas. Fashioning reindeer horns for his dog and Santa suit for himself, the Grinch drives a sleigh down into Whoville while the Whos are asleep on Christmas Eve. He steals their lights, their ribbons, and their bows. He steals their boxes, packages, and bags. He steals wreathes and Christmas trees and even their Roast Beast (why that evil Grinch even stole the Who hash). And only thing he left behind was a crumb far too small for even a mouse. Caught in the act of stealing a Christmas tree by tiny little Cindy Loo Who, the Grinch tells an evil lie about taking the tree to his shop to fix the lights and sends the girl back to bed.

Leaving Whoville with his bounty, the Grinch starts off the highest mountain peak where he plans to throw all the Who stuff off a cliff. But first, he waits to hear the cries of pain from the Whos as they wake up to find all of their things long gone. Instead, every Who down in Whoville gathers together to sing a song. They aren't sad. In fact, they seem to be glad. The Grinch ponders this unaccounted for event and discovers the true meaning of Christmas. In an effort to save the sleigh full of Who stuff from falling off of the cliff, his heart grows seven sizes on that day, and he gains the strength of seven Grinches times ten. He rides the sleigh full of presents back into Whoville, where he celebrates Christmas with the Whos and even carves the Roast Beast...

Created under the direction of Chuck Jones (creator of famed Warner Brothers characters Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote, and Pepe Le Pew), How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a masterful production with stellar voice-overs, imaginatively drawn characters, and Karloff's impressive narration. Several songs interspersed throughout are memorable in and of themselves (such as ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch""). In a nutshell, no celebration of the Christmas holidays is truly complete without at least one viewing of How The Grinch Stole Christmas...

Borlis Karloff is creepy as the voice of the Grinch. and alluring as the narrator. Chuck Jones is a brillaint cartoonis. as is Dr Seuss who made many lovely books. both of these 2 toons on dvd are timeless. I must of seen the Grinch one 100 times on tv at least. you can never get sick of it. it may be short in time span. but the Grinch tale is so powerful that in 24 minutes you grow to realize that Christmas is not about gifts and toys. it's about being together with loved ones and family. that and don't steal things from others. it's a touching classic story. when I have kids someday I'll have them watch this with me. it's really a touching story.

Funnily, in the Seuss book, the Grinch is drawn with india ink and the Grinch himself isn't any color at all except for reddish eyes and a red Santa suit, when donned.  On my daughter's bedroom wall, we have hanging an original Chuck Jones cell--the color of the Grinch in the cell is somewhere between the green of the VHS tape and the yellow-green of the DVD.  Isn't Technicolor wonderful?

My four-year old daughter noticed that the string used to tie the horn to Max's head is red in the book, black in the cartoon, and this seems to be the major deviation from the text as written.  Was this a mis-read by Karloff or was it intentional?",1104192000,5,807,4.248366013071895

I still enjoy watching the transformation of the Grinch from a Christmas criminal to the Christmas hero.  I still enjoy singing, ""You're A Mean One Mister Grinch"", with Mr. Ravenscroft (Tony the Tiger).  I still enjoy the rhyming story written by Dr. Seuss and narrated by Boris Karloff.

The DVD is nice but people are right to complain about the color.  The ""green"" Grinch you see on the cover is not Grinch you'll see when you watch the DVD.  My Grinch was more of a greenish-gray color.  I don't know what is involved in digitally cleaning a film but I suspect that is what is ruining the colors.  I had a similar problem with my DVD version of WHITE CHRISTMAS.  It, like HTGSC, had muted colors that failed to match the earlier VHS release.  However, the muted and slightly distorted colors were not bad enough for me to reduce my rating of this Christmas special.  It is still a 5 star special to me.",1104105600,4,1081,4.409090909090909

Love the story, hate the color and the audio.  At least you don't have to rewind it everytime you get done watching it.

I did discover on my tv sets that turning the tint abnomrally toward the green side mostly fixes the color of the Grinch while watching the DVD.  Interestingly enough, all the other colors also seem to be ok with this tint setting.  Someone really screwed up the color settings when mastering this one...

Maybe Horton's color is all wrong too?  There's nothing to reference it to except maybe the original book version.  ;^)

I wanted my son to see the grinch because it's a Christmas tradition for me.. When I received it I popped it into my DVD player to find out that THE COLOR OF THE GRINCH IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT IS ON THE VHS! Kind of a pea green color. I'm so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews! My son loves the Grinch (cartoon and movie) but he LOVES Horton Hears a Who (he's actually watching it right now for the 2nd time in a row).

I decided it was time to get it so I went to Best Buy one day for the sole purpose of just buying this DVD. Abd let me tell you, IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY! The presentation of the show is great and it contains some nifty extras including a half-hour documentary on how the film was made hosted by the late Phil Hartman.

But there's more! You also get Horton Hears A Who! Another one of my all-time favorites in the Dr. Seuss animation dept. The extras on Horton are really thin but you bought the DVD for the main purpose of seeing the Grinch. There is also a neat 10-question trivia game included with the Grinch extras on the show and is fairly easy. But the kids will surely enjoy it!

After not having seen this in quite some time, and not since Jim Carrey's version, it was great to return to one of Chuck Jones' masterpieces.  As the marvelous Boris Karloff narrates, the Grinch comes to life reminding us that he was considerably more dour initially than the wild barely contained slapstick Carrey brought to the table.  The famous Grinch song moves us slowly along like a black sludge as the Grinch endeavors to steal the commercial trappings of Christmas from the Who village.  In the end, of course, good triumphs and the Grinch repents his ways and gets the picture of the holidays as a `feeling' rather than material things.

930148,2,6304698771,"These are two excellent stories and my kids love them as much as I do.  Unfortunately, Warner Bros appears to have done the DVD on the cheap.
The overall color is much improved, very bright and vivid (the yellow Grinch not withstanding), but absolutely no effort was made to clean up the picture.  Defects and noise that don't show up on VHS are very distracting on the DVD.  There are several scenes where you can see the background disruption caused by layering animation of the Grinch over a static background.  Probably normal back in 1966 for television animation, but a real indicator of the lack of effort put into this DVD.  I also see no reason that the fade-to-black cuts designed for commercials could not be deleted, I could do that on my home software with almost no effort.
Since Warner Bros does not advertise this as remastered or enhanced then I guess there was no foul on their part, but I expect a quality improvement when an old classic goes to DVD.  That is the reason most people buy DVD's to begin with.  I don't know how a company can expect you to spend money to replace movies you already have on video if they don't give you something for your money.
The background pieces are good, but these are not new.  All Warner Bros did was toss a couple of existing products on the disc.  Once again, the least expensive route.
Warner Bros is also on a cost cutting binge with their DVD cases.  This was the first of many Warner Bros DVD's I bought or received this Christmas that came in fiberboard cases rather than the standard plasctic DVD case.  I suspect that these cheaper cases will not stand up to repeated use by my children.
I will definitely think twice before buying another Warner Bros product anytime soon.
Overall, I recommend both of these stories/cartoons to everyone, they are the product of genius, but until a remastered product is released I recommend the VHS version.",1072310400,12,1908,4.59882005899705

What is more, this 1966 version adds a wonderful EPILOGUE entitled ""WELCOME CHRISTMAS"" which is completely absent from the original 1957 poem.

Disguising himself as Santa, he sneaks down into the town to take everything Christmassy, and everything else, from them.  But will that stop Christmas from coming?  Is he beyond enjoying the season himself?
What can I say; this is a great holiday special.  There were only a handful I had to watch every year growing up, and this is one of them.  That's extended to my adult Decembers as well.  It keeps the story simple, not trying to expand it needlessly like the recent live action movie did.  And the songs add to the fun, especially ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.""  That song alone is worth watching the special for.
This DVD is a great way to own this classic.  The picture and sound are good.  I can't really tell that much difference in how the Grinch is supposed to look, and to me this is a minor issue anyway.  The extras are a mixed bag.  The audio commentary isn't that great because it's obvious that they really don't have that much to say.  However, the special about the making of the cartoon and the separate interview about writing the songs are both interesting.
This disc also includes another cartoon from a Dr. Seuss book, HORTON HEARS A WHO.  I had never seen this special before I bought the disc, but I'm not a fan of it.  Not sure why because I like the book.  Maybe if I'd seen it as a kid I'd feel differently.

930216,5,6304698771,"I should begin by saying, after reading other reviews where people complain about the color of the Grinch: I don't see the problem. The Grinch on the box is bright green, but *that* was the thing that didn't seem quite right to me. The color of the Grinch in the program itself was just fine. I assumed they whipped up some fancy artwork for the DVD cover. I had actually taped the Grinch off a local TV channel shortly before receiving this DVD for Christmas, so I played them both and compared the colors. Again, no problems.
Moving on to the actual content...what a treat this DVD is! Not one but two features about the Grinch: TNT's 1994 special with the late and sorely missed Phil Hartman, and another also featuring interviews with composer Albert Hague and singer Thurl Ravenscroft (who always tells delightful stories about being involved in the project). You can also skip directly to any of the songs, and there's a cute little trivia game for the kids.
Just for fun, I turned on the subtitles to see how they'd handle all the strange Seuss words. The accuracy of the whole program is weak in spots (the Grinch is a ""crooked dirty trockey""? I think you mean ""jockey""), and the Whos' songs (""Welcome Christmas"" and ""Trim Up the Tree"") are not captioned at all, which is kind of a shame.

930218,5,6304698771,"Since I am sure most of the world is familiar with How the Grinch Stole Christmas, it is most likely unneccesary to discuss this high caliber little story. The presentation of the story is worth mentioning however, since I have never seen the Grinch in a more colorful or crisp display than on this DVD. Besides this wonderful classic, we are offered an AMAZING treat in the features. An older TNT special on the making of the Grinch is included on the disc and in my opinion, is worth the price alone. The special is hosted by the gloriously campy Phil Hartman before his tragic death. He literally demonstrates the way the Grinch was made from beginning to end. At one point his voice is dubbed over the classic voice of Boris Karloff to demonstrate how perfect Karloff's voice was for the role. We are treated to the Grinch played by John Wayne and Jack Nicholson, as well as other hilarious impersonations that made Hartman a genius. He also shows us the many ""tools"" used to create sound effects for the Grinch. Children will find this particularly interesting.
On top of this now preserved ""performance"" by Hartman, we are treated to interview segments with the now deceased Chuck Jones who shares wonderful tidbits about working with the genius Dr. Seuss. Speaking of Dr. Seuss, his wife is interviewed as well and gives us nice details about her husband and his love for his work. We are also given great background on the music of the Grinch, the most amazing thing being that Boris Karloff in fact did not sing the famous ""You're a Mean One Mister Grinch."" In fact, the man who did was never credited with his performance. We now know him best as Tony the Tiger and his most famous line, ""It's GRRRRREAT!""
Along with these special features and the feature, ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" we get another Dr. Seuss classic, ""Horton Hears a Who"". This feature is also decently restored, although the picture is not near as high quality as ""The Grinch"". Horton, an elephant, hears a tiny voice screaming ""help!"" from a speck of dust one day (he has very large ears) and quips the line ""I must save them, because after all, a person is a person no matter how small"". The rest of the feature shows Horton's dilemma as his fellow jungle friends who do not hear the voice believe Horton is going mad and attempt to punish him and destroy the dust. We also learn that the voice is in fact coming from Whoville (the same as in the Grinch) and that the entire town is so tiny that it is entirely inside the speck of dust. The Who's don't believe that anything exists outside their world and thus, don't know of their impending danger, except for one Who who has built a large telescope which stretches to the outside of their world. Both the Who and Horton have to deal with the fact that society doesn't believe they have truly spoken with one another.
If you find it difficult to spend money on a Christmas classic that lasts only half an hour and would only be watched during one season of the year, then the addition of Horton should make the purchase more worth while. This DVD is a classic every way you look at it. Two classic cartoons, and footage of personalities now gone but forever imprinted on our hearts. By way of Christmas classics, few are better than ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Even my husband still sheds a small tear when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes. We now have this endearing work to share with our children any time we want.",1039478400,,3464,4.552884615384615

930272,5,6304698771,"I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. I wasn't expecting too much; I mean, is a 30 minute TV special worth the price of a DVD? I knew that there was a commentary and a few pencil sketches, which made me feel a bit better, but when I got it home and found out that it also contained a documentary and a short music segment, PLUS ""Horton Hears a Who"" (also containing bonus material), I was excited.
First, ""The Grinch:""  never have I seen it this clear. The commentary, sadly enough, does not include director Chuck Jones. It features one of the animators and June Foray (Cindy Lou Who). That doesn't sound promising: an animator and the voice of a character who has about 2 lines in the whole cartoon? However, it is quite good as both are veterans of the cartoon industry and shared not only their experiences with Chuck Jones and Dr. Seuss on this project, but their experiences as part of animation history. The documentary is really an old TV special that details some of the making of the Grinch while also explaining animation basics. It doesn't get very technical, but at least Chuck Jones makes an appearance. The most exciting things in the documentary were clips of the film as a work-in-progress. I would have liked to have seen the entire thing as a work-in-progress, but perhaps it wasn't available. The short interview segment on the music was also nice. I don't think I will ever be able to hear ""You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch"" without thinking of Tony the Tiger.
Horton Hears a Who is included as a bonus feature, presumably because both feature Whos. It had never occurred to me that the 2 stories were related until I got this disc. This feature is not as widely seen as The Grinch, and the story is pretty heady stuff. The bonus materials for this subject are pretty skimpy; basically just some pencil sketches. It would have been nice to have at least some production notes. I mean, Dr. Whoovey looks an awful lot like Chuck Jones, who provided the voice, but there isn't any information about that or anything else.
The Grinch is a Christmas classic that usually receives repeated viewings every year, and DVD will definitely outlast old-fashioned VHS in that category. Even with the shortcomings of Horton, this disc is well worth the price, and you'd have to be a Grinch not to enjoy almost 2 crystal-clear hours of classic Chuck Jones animation.",1009411200,5,2370,4.629453681710213

""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"": On Mount Crumpit, the Grinch lives watching the Whos down in Whoville celebrate Christmas every year. And every year, the Grinch becomes grumpy and angry about all the noise, the singing, the feasting, and practically the whole idea of Christmas. Then he gets and idea, and wonderful, awful idea! With the help of his dog Max, he decides to steal Christmas.
Who can resist the charm of the wonderful world which Dr. Seuss creates? You just have to love all of the narration, the music, and the whole idea of the Grinch and the Whos. The spirit and meaning of Christmas it well told in this story. The songs like ""Welcome Christmas"", ""Trim Up the Tree"", and ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"". Boris Karloff certainly is great but I think my favorite character would have to be the cute and adorable Max. A movie you'll just have to watch for Christmas!
""Horton Hears a Who"": Horton the Elephant is surprised find a dust speck, which is really a tiny planet where the Whos live. But no one believes him, including Jane and Junior the Kangaroos and the Wickersham brothers. Can Horton make the others believe in the Whos before they boil the dust speck!
Another truly fun story! The songs are so much fun, especially ""Mrs. Toucanella Told Me"" and ""Wickersham Brother's Song""! I also watch ""Horton Hears a Who"" with the English subtitles on so I can sing along! (One of the advantages of having a DVD player!)
So, to put it all together, if you still haven't seen these two Dr. Seuss movies, I suggest you get the movie as soon as possible. Great for the Christmas season, great for all year round! Fun for both kids and adults!",1008633600,3,1867,4.576119402985075

930280,5,6304698771,"Chuck Jones, America's premiere comic animator was firing on all pistons when he adapted Dr. Seuss' famous tale of the small hearted Grinch and his good hearted dog Max who almost stopped Christmas from coming.  This version is new and improved. While the last DVD included both stories of the unlucky ""Whos"" with a blow by blow commentary, the new digitally enhanced version includes a sweet little documentary hosted by our sadly departed Saturday Night Live comic Phil Hartman. There is only a slight improvement in the digitally enhanced version over the early analog copy.  One of the things people find most peculiar things about watching the Grinch is that he is mustard yellow with a brown collar.  This is extra disturbing now as on the DVD cover and the new Jim Carrey live action Grinch is very green. When the Grinch steals into Whoville on Christmas eve you will notice he becomes a bit greener because it is a convention in animation to add blue to the paint at night. So rest assured, especially those of you who purchase the digitally enhanced copy, they did not screw up the color.  Notice the green packages and the plonking Who-blonkers have many perfectly subtle shades of green when the Grinch stands near. An interesting bit of Grinch trivia is the identity of the deep voiced singer who sang the song about the evil Mr. Grinch. Why it is none other but the voice of children's cereal favorite Tony the Tiger, Thurl Ravenscroft.  He was hired to do the voice at the last minute and did the whole thing in just a couple hours and left.  He was never credited in the film and Dr. Suess apologized to him later as his voice helped make the film immortal. Boris Karloff narrates and voices the Grinch. If you wish to reminisce about the original children's book, type ""Grinch text"" into your search engine and select the top choices and you can re-read the text and see the original illustrations.
  Included on the disc is ""Horton Hears a Who"". The story of the faith of the good-hearted elephant with big ears who recognizes that a person is a person no matter how small. Horton hears a ""Who"" on a dust speck and must convince his unbelieving friends and the evil Wickersham brothers not to ""Boil that dust speck"". Either version, Digitally enhanced or not are fairly comparable if you are interested in just the movies.  Neither version is widescreen as the cartoon was made for TV.

The Grinch realizes he was wrong and well, you'll have to see the rest!

It's the perfect way to put your Little Cindy Lou Who to bed on Christmas Eve, or any night of the year.  ""Hurton Hears A Who"" is another delightful story, which will be especially popular with animal lovers.  The animated adaptations of these two stories are a ""hatful"" of fun! Here's more on each of the shorts, because a person is a person is a person is a person no matter how small, and you deserve some good protect information.
""HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS"" is the story of the rotten-hearted Grinch, who, well, tries to steal Christmas!  But he learns his lesson eventually, as everyone does--it's not about THINGS.  It's about holiday spirit and being together.  The anamation is as lighthearted as the pictures in the Dr. Suess picturebook, and the words are almost the same as the ones in the book.  This one is sure to please, and will make a nifty stocking stuffer.  But it's be even niftier when paired with....
""HURTON HEARS A WHO"" is a very cute adaptation of another Suess offering, taking place in two completly different worlds about to collide.  Hurton the Elephent finds a tiny part of a flower, which contains a whole different world.  Hurton makes contact with a scientist in this second world, and learns how different the worlds are.  But because a person is a person no matter how small, Hurton decides to help his newfound friend.  The one major problem here is that NO ONE BELIEVES EITHER HURTON OR HIS FRIEND.  What will happen next????  This one will keep kids in suspense, but I like the former of the cartoons better.
To end--The Grinch is a mean one, and your kids will think YOU'RE mean if you don't stuff their stocking with this.  It's collectively a perfect video, and kids will be excited to hear that the soundtracks to both films appear unabriged on a single CD.
