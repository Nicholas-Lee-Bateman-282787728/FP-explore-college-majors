8067008,1,B0009UVBZO,"If there was a way to give this dvd several negative stars I would definitely do it!  What a waste of money!  All you see in the whole thing is a couple of different PLASTIC pumpkins set in different badly staged places.  Sometimes they are lit with a fake flame sometimes they aren't.  Oh yeah...there is some guy skulking around in a cheap Halloween costume too.  The sound effects are laughable.  I was planning to have this playing in the background of my Halloween party this year but would now be embarrased to.  The packaging is deceiving in regard to whether it was made professionally.  I'll either be giving this away, probably anonymously to an enemy, or throwing it away which is redundant in regard to the $10 I spent on it.  Be warned...the 5 star rating this has received was probably entered by the creater of the dvd.",1223078400,4,834,4.543624161073826
8067009,1,B0009UVBZO,I can't find the words to describe this utter failure.  The spooky sounds and images are highly repetetive and hokey.  The production value is hilarious.  There is no way to skip the more annoying effects to get to the halfway listenable ones because it's all one long track.  The only scary part was that I actually paid 13 dollars for it.,1159833600,5,340,4.524590163934426
