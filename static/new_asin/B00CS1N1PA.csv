5736469,4,B00CS1N1PA,"Lucky enough to see this during its limited theatrical run. Definitely one of the best horror-comedies I've seen in a long, long time. Great performances and lots of fun surprises including one of the funniest/most disturbing sex scenes you'll ever see... though potentially you'll be looking the other way trough some of it. Is it just me or are the Aussies a really sick and twisted bunch? Love the music too!",1376611200,,411,4.802816901408451
5736470,3,B00CS1N1PA,"Sophie (Anna McGahan) along with her BF (Oliver Ackland) and Wesley (Jamie Kristian) a male rival are headed via the back roads to a music festival when their automobile breaks down. They get a ride from Reg Morgan (Damon Herriman) who is driving the company truck of Morgan Brother's ""Blood and Bone"" organic fertilizer. Not too hard to figure the rest out.

The film has some blood splatter scenes, but lacks the gore. This slasher film is in part dark comedy as Reg, is the younger partner brother who is insecure in what he does as well as being sexually repressed. While facing death, Sophie's boyfriend is more concerned about her infidelity, wanting to know the details of what she did, rather than being worried about the situation at hand.

The film is a good concept, but comes off as going through the motions. Okay as a rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex or nudity. One scene of apparent self gratification.",1373068800,,924,4.726708074534161

8585477,5,B00CS1N1PA,"The Morgan brothers run a fertilizer business in the remote countryside somewhere in Australia (the movie is shot in South Australia), an area famous for the disappearance of a number of corpses from a multi vehicle crash.  When three from the city musical festival attendees (two guys and a girl) break down on a backroad, Reg (Damon Herriman), one of the brothers decides to give them a lift to the festival after he's made his delivery.  But the guys discover something in the back of his truck and Reg who is a bit mentally challenged, knows he'll get in trouble, so comes up with a plan to use and silence the three.  His brother Lindsay (Angus Sampson) is home on their property and is shocked at what his brother has brought them, but embraces the idea, since well he really has no other choice.  But these brothers have never done this sort of thing before.  Reg is having second thoughts, and is starting to develop feelings for the girl (Anna McGahan).

The two male festival goers are played by Oliver Ackland and Jamie Kristian.  Neither are likable characters but both actors do a good job. John Jarratt (Wolf Creek) also has a small cameo in this.  This is a fun light horror comedy.  It doesn't have a huge body count, because there just aren't that many people in the movie. It isn't the goriest thing you'll ever watch.  There is a sex scene but it's a laugh at one, not a flesh revealing one.  If you get the region 4 DVD there's plenty of extras including, making of, bloopers and a number of TV commercials the Morgan Brothers have made for their fertilizer business.  We also see the characters go to a radio station or whatever and record the radio advertisement in the movie.",1525564800,,1698,4.5493421052631575

8585479,5,B00CS1N1PA,"Very violent, totally original Australian horror-comedy. Follow two brothers as they find a way to spice up and grow their fertilizer business in an unusual way. Not for the faint of heart - but a great movie for fans of B style horror.",1472083200,,236,4.511627906976744
8585480,5,B00CS1N1PA,"Awesome import from Australia! Only watched for the actor from the TV series Justified and the whole movie was a blast! First caught this on Netflix and Knew that I must add the blu ray to my collection. This is one dark, bloody horror/comedy film. It is extremely violent so its not for the easily offended by graphic violence. This ranks way up there on my list as one of the best dark comedy I have seen in years (What We Do in the Shadows from New Zealand comes a close second). If you like twisted humor with your blood, check out 100 Bloody Acres. Had me on the floor laughing (in a twisted way).",1425081600,,602,4.243478260869566

8585482,4,B00CS1N1PA,"Do you like films where apparently happy characters drive out to Australian hillbilly country, get stuck, then grab a lift with a hillbilly who happens to have a corpse in the back of his truck? Do you like ""city slickers"" being dangled by chains over industrial grade meat grinders? Do you like watching great hulking psychopaths named Linds with a big black beard and no mustache of soul patch?
Well if you do, you'll love 100 Bloody Acres.
Seriously, it's a really good film. But don't let that eclipse the real news: Popeye fans rejoice! We have found the new live action Blutto!!!! His name is Angus Sampson and he plays the aforementioned Linds. I'm not joking people. He is the ""chosen one"" of whom the Sea Hag spoke!",1404086400,,724,4.62015503875969
8585483,2,B00CS1N1PA,"So, as Australian movies looked to pick up over the last few years with such greats as Storm Warning up to Wolf Creek 2. However, this movie here just does everything an Aussie horror movie doesn't need. (BTW I am Australian)

What really irritates me about Australian made films is they never show the real Australian, they just show the typical country bumkin stereo type out in the middle of nowhere that is pawned off as ""The Bush"" and shoot inside a tin shed. It surprises me this film didn't have a waste of scenery shots of nothing and a bunch of inserted shots of cockatoos and koalas.

Now, I don't mind Angus Sampson as a comedian. He's provided some great comedic talent on shows like ""Thank God Your Here"" and a few television commercials. But as someone trying to do some serious acting, he really needs to just get out of the game and stop trying. His acting skills where horrible in Insidious as one half of the paranormal investigators, but the only thing you can say he's improved on in this film is not trying to hide his Australian accent. However his performance in this is not going to make any future casting agents take note of him.

The plot evolves around 3 people on their way to some sort of concert in the middle of nowhere, and instead of taking the highways, they have taken the back-roads and low and behold the car just happens to stall in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It doesn't look like things will be bad for the 3 hitchhikers when they meet a nice slow friendly country bumpkin who shovels $#!% for a living, but ya know, they happen to discover a dead body in the back of the truck! Look, it's not a spoiler, OK, it happens within the first minute of the film, and it's shown in the trailer too. But it makes absolutely no sense as to why this guy just happened to hide this body in the back of the truck when he discovered the guy dead in his car on the side of the road. It's not like he killed him... but ya know, the reason behind you discover later is just absolutely stupid. As stupid as these 3 find themselves kidnapped by this guy and his brother and they won't get to party all night by the look of it.

What failed in this movie was everything that could have made it something. Wolf Creek II at least made it a fun gore ride... did this film have any gore? No, not really. So maybe they should go for the comedy approach?... well, they attempted it, but very little was funny, and what's especially not funny is someone tripping on acid in peril. Not only has that been done before, many times, but this ones take on it gave it no new life or made it fresh in anyway. Is there any shock value to the film? Mmmmmm nope! So what does this film have going for it? A typical out the middle of nowhere atmosphere that is cheap to make films in and a typical shed where it all takes place. Seen something like that before? Yeah, it's pretty much a standard for anyone who makes a film in Victoria. You must have to sign contracts or are offered discounts if you shoot out there and include sheds. Enough already. The glory days of the world wanting more Mad Max is over. Show the world what the real Australia looks like, not the acres of nothingness of sand, dirt, farms and eucalyptus trees.

Or at least, if you are going to film out there, make a decent bloody movie out of it. If Wolf Creek 2 could manage it, why can't others?

I think the other thing I found disappointing in this film was I thought it was going to be something along the lines of ""Tucker & Dale vs Evil"", but it's not even remotely simmilar. This one just seemed to come off as your typical standard average every day Australian excuse for a horror picture. Had it been made in the 70's it would probably be a cult classic, but times have changed, and this one just comes off as a bad clone of a few movies with nothing special about it what-so-ever.

And for those saying the film has heart? Yeah, ummm, go compare this to another Aussie movie called ""Bad Boy Bubby"" if that's what you really think.",1403395200,,4026,4.2894736842105265
8585484,5,B00CS1N1PA,this one too is worth watching.  it was a used dvd and it came in quickly.  very impressed with amazon. will order movies again on this site.,1388966400,,141,4.185185185185185
8585485,5,B00CS1N1PA,"its great a different type of horror movie and from the ""outback"",cant wait for the sequel...insert sarcasm here ...do that",1388016000,,123,5.2
8585486,3,B00CS1N1PA,"The Morgan brothers run a blood and bone fertilizer business in the isolated backwoods of Australia. Not content with just using road kill to make their product, they begin relying on car crash victims found by the side of the road. When they cross paths with three kids on their way to get drugged up at a music festival, it becomes a struggle to see who will survive and if the Morgan brothers will be able to make a big shipment of ""new blend"" to one of their biggest clients.

The movie is pretty gory from the start, although I've seen worse. It bills itself as a gory comedy. It is funny in parts, but so much of the humor is mixed in with the character development that it gets a little tedious, especially when the film starts to spiral out of control and the script starts asking the audience to actually sympathize with any of the characters. Not a single one of them is likable, though. The three teens are composed of a girl who cheats on her incredibly whiny boyfriend with his best friend. The film wants you to root for the girl, but she's wishy-washy, self-righteous, and kinda dumb. Of the Morgan brothers, the youngest is poor Reggie. He seems to have a mental handicap and is constantly abused by his older brother, so the film also paints him as a sympathetic character. However, he's also the one who gets the idea at the start of the film to kidnap and kill the three teens.

The point being: if the film had decided to take a completely amoral stance and had sent the plot into a total splatter-fest, it might have risen above being just mediocre. The third act feels a lot like that's where it's headed, but at the last minute, the movie veers into sentimental schmaltz, and starts asking you to cheer for survivors, when the entire story has been leading up to a maximum body count. This hokey stab at sentiment detracts from both the gore and the comedy, making it all just seem dumb. Not without its charms for fans of blood, guts, and goofiness, the film just doesn't have the edge to sustain itself through the drama.",1381017600,2,2046,4.453333333333333
