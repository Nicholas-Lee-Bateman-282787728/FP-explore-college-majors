8555870,5,B00AQ0IYFM,"I purchased this set directly from Michaela Sirbu and not from Amazon. I was a bit worried about spending so much on a set of DVDs without any reviews; however, my fears were quickly put to rest after just watching the stretching DVD. If you are looking for more than how to stretch and massage, then this is probably the set for you. Michaela is very straight forward and doesn't waste your time with useless information. The DVDs are packed with every imaginable exercise and stretch/massage with your foam roller.

I'm 44 and have been riding a 36"" unicycle for many years. Last year I started experiencing knee pain after about an hour of riding. I wen to my doctor who ordered an ultrasound and an x-ray. Both of which, came out in the normal range. The doctor gave me a shot of steroid under my knee cap. This did nothing for my pain. So I did a search on the internet for possible fixes. I ordered a DVD, titled ""Strong Knees."" This was the cure that I ""Kneeded!"" :) After just a week of Yoga exercise, building some knee muscles, I felt no more knee pain. However, I started getting severe leg cramps/knots. The stretches helped a little, but wasn't enough to get the rid of the spasms that I was experiencing.

After an extensive search, I ordered ""I Love My Foam Roller.""  I love this set! 3 hours and 27 minutes of instruction!!! This is a complete workout. The stretches were painful at first and that is to be expected. But if you are persistent and keep up on the stretches the pain will subside. After each session of stretching I felt much better. I use to experience back pain, but even that has been helped by doing the exercises included in this set.

I guess the best part of purchasing this set, is that if you ever have a question, Michaela is more than willing to help you out. She is very knowledgeable and has great customer service.",1375315200,5,1858,4.439882697947214
