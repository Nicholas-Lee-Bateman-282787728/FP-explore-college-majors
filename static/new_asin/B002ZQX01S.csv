8385227,3,B002ZQX01S,"This concert has a nice selection of songs. However, Stuart's vocals are sometimes buried in the mix. Amazon also states the dvd is region 2. It's actually region zero. It played fine in my US Blu-ray player.",1445385600,2,208,4.648648648648648
8385228,5,B002ZQX01S,I am a huge big country fan and have all of their US dvd releases as well as several imports.  Great rare footage of the band.  If your a fan a must addition to your collection!,1355184000,6,177,3.888888888888889
