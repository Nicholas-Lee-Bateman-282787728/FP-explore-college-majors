2521631,4,B000EJ1VLE,"Revisiting BUNTY AUR BABLI. I haven't seen this fun Hindi film in eons, and it's definitely grown on me with repeated viewings. BUNTY AUR BABLI clocks in heftily at around two and a half hours long, which is the typical length of a Bollywood picture. When I first saw this years ago, I remember liking it but not liking it as much as KUCH NAA KAHO or DHAAI AKSHAR PREM KE, two other films which featured Abhishek Bachchan. But BUNTY AUR BABLI, I guess, ages like fine wine.

So, the plot: Rakesh (Abhishek Bachchan) is a young man determined to escape his humdrum, small-city life. He opts to leave home when given an ultimatum by his father to either show up in a job interview or to get lost. Rakesh, you see, has come up with the perfect business scheme which he believes will propel him to immediate financial success. Meet also Vimmi (Rani Mukerji) who wants more of life than to become a typical arranged bride and so runs away to pursue her dream of becoming Miss India. Both of these young hopefuls' plans go awry. Then they meet and Rakesh and Vimmi transform into Bunty and Babli, scammers extraordinaire, bilking people of their riches and then sharing the wealth with the poor and downtrodden. Halfway thru the film Dashrath Singh strides in, a bulldog of a policeman played in full taciturn glory by iconic actor (and Abhishek's father) Amitabh Bachchan. The remainder of the film chronicles DCP Singh's frustrated attempts to nab the carefree criminals, Bunty and Babli, who had by then become modern day legends.

Nowadays Abhishek tends to go with the bearded look, so it's a bit jarring to eyeball him here all whisker-free. He takes on his role with good humor, but I tend to be on sure footing when Abhishek is starring in a film. He's an entertaining cat. BUNTY AUR BABLI was when I first saw Amitabh Bachchan, who is large in India, and I thought he was okay. It wasn't until I saw KHAKEE that I finally got what the icon status was all about. Rani Mukerji is cute, although her character's occasional (and unconvincing) weeping may grate on the nerves. Incidentally, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but this may have been the first movie that both the Bachchan men have been in.

So, this is Bollywood where song & dance are alive and well and pop up with unexpected frequency. There are two musical numbers to anticipate. One (""B & B"") takes place in the closing credits, with an MTV-like video of the elder Bachchan portraying his policeman character rapping/lipsynching in English - it cracked me up. The other one is the penultimate number, ""Kajra Re"" (Night Eyes), a gem of a specialty item featuring Aishwarya Rai, wherein she engages the two Bachchans in a smoking dancefest - very cool, with Aish very hot. To be utterly honest, back in 2006, Ms. Rai (now Mrs. Bachchan) was the main reason I purchased this movie. Yup indeedy, her one guest musical performance now elevates my eval of this flick to 4 out of 5 stars. When I first saw this film back in the middle oughts, my rating was a bit lower. As mentioned, repeated viewings have made me reevaluate. I've gotten fonder of the film.

To sum up, BUNTY AUR BABLI is a diverting watch. It has no airs about it. It just wants to entertain its audience. It knows what it is and cheerfully hams it up to the hilt. It won't challenge your mind, but it may make a run at your heartstrings. It won't make you fall into a deep reverie, but you may grin at the sheer goofiness and escapism of the story. If you've got nothing better to do one evening, pop this musical-comedy DVD in and take a load off. Suspend disbelief as hard as you can and be gentle on the actors. They're all better than this movie, and this movie's not at all bad.",1328313600,,3713,4.520833333333333
2521632,3,B000EJ1VLE,"BUNTY AUR BABLI is a fun movie. For American viewers it's BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE Meets BONNIE AND CLYDE. Bunty (the guy) and Babli (the girl) are both so good natured and so good looking that it's hard to remember that they're grifters.

Actually, they aren't. They're just two kids from small towns looking to escape the family business (Bunty) and a traditional arranged marriage (Babli). They run off (separately), meet, and begin a long string of criminal misadventures, mostly defrauding obnoxious rich people, all the while having a blast.

The film is seemingly endless, and presents us with (at least) one of everything onscreen, including the kitchen sink. Flashy dance club routines break up the action, characters come and go in profusion, the storyline wanders more than an Indian mendicant on his way to Varanasi, and somewhere inside the third hour of the film the typical American viewer comes to realize that Bollywood loves colorful excess and pretty people.  Not too different from Hollywood, really.",1282348800,,1030,5.155688622754491
2521633,4,B000EJ1VLE,"Bunty Aur Babli was a movie I bought on a whim because it appeared as a suggestion based on other films I bought, and I'm glad i did. This is a movie that just makes you smile and laugh all the way through. It is light on plot in the first half, then introduces more serious moments in the second half, which surprisingly work perfect for the story. The tone is upbeat, the music is fun, and the story is a hilarious take on a Bonnie and Clyde kind of couple. Its a Bollywood film that proves that formula can work with the right stars, script, and music. If you like romantic comedies this is a great pick.",1281484800,,607,4.1525423728813555
2521634,5,B000EJ1VLE,"On the heels of their award-winning performances as an abusive thug and his suffering wife in Yuva (2004), Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji are paired again, this time, in lighter fare--the romantic comedy Bunty Aur Babli--playing a hen-pecked con artist and his vivacious partner in crime--and their delivery is just as strong.

Amitabh Bachchan appears with his son Abhishek for the first time in this film--and they went on to memorable onscreen collaborations in Sarkar (2005), Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), Sarkar Raj (2008), and Paa (2009). Here, the senior Bachchan--a jack of all genres--plays Dashrath, a cool, crusty police detective, and he hams it up to the fullest in bomber jacket and aviator sunglasses while hot on the trail of two notorious small-town kids on a crime spree. His interaction with his son's character, Rakesh, is a riot.

Director Shaad Ali's previous film Saathiya (2002), which also starred Mukerji, was a serious story also about impulsive young lovers who strike out on their own, and here again, Ali creates vivid working-class characters, and his signature metaphor of train travel figures largely.

Rakesh meets Vimmi (Mukerji) in a train station after both have run away from home. They're dreamers who want more out of life than their parents imagine for them, and they're frustrated with the limitations of their upbringings. Believing they're destined for bigger and better things--Vimmi wants to be Miss India and Rakesh has a business idea--and delighted to discover a kindred spirit, they hit the road together. When their plans are a bust, they start scamming for money--and they have so much fun doing it, they don't want to stop. They hilariously impersonate government officials, spiritual gurus, gangsters, and business partners to trick people into giving them free meals, hotel rooms, cars, and cash. They adopt the names Bunty and Babli and leave their initials at every crime scene as they crisscross North India at a frenetic pace and gain fame as a crime duo. Finally, they're successful and important, as they always hoped to be.

While they start out as pals, it's inevitable that this reckless, passionate couple fall in love. After all, they argued like an old married couple from day one--so they make it official. But once hitched, everything changes. Suddenly, Vimmi has different priorities, and they have to find a way to be true to themselves while taking responsibility for each other. But that's not an easy thing to do with Dashrath always one step behind them.

2521635,5,B000EJ1VLE,The Songs were the best part of the movie.  Overall a good look into the different mentality of movies and life in general in that region of the world.  The english CC was close to what was really said but some of the translations were funnier.,1267574400,,244,4.282608695652174
2521636,5,B000EJ1VLE,"This movie and a couple of other ""Bollywood"" movies that I bought at the same time have completely turned me around on this genre of film. There are 2 big time song and dance productions in Bunty Aur Babli that are stunning. Nach Baliye explodes on the screen with incredible energy that manages to build during the performance. Kajra Re begins softly and quaint and builds to an almost furious pace that is rooted in tradition and spectacular in design. The musical score, choreography, cinematography and performances by all of the actors and dancers are first rate. The rest of the music in the film isn't half bad either, not to mention the story that is thrown in.

Rani Mukerjee is wonderful as Babli. There is a scene where she cries like Lucille Ball ala I Love Lucy where it actually adds to the scene.",1241827200,,811,4.593103448275862
2521641,5,B000EJ1VLE,This movie is really good. Cute and not overly silly. I like it that the main actor's lives don't turn out the way they want all the time. Makes it more realistic...kind of. Abhishek and Rani are a great pair. The soundtrack is also great.,1217116800,,239,4.333333333333333
2521642,5,B000EJ1VLE,"I think this movie was part ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and part ""Catch Me If You Can"". The story was pure fantasy, but totally engaging and fun. The songs were catchy, and I find myself humming the tunes even a couple of weeks after watching the movie. There is also a cameo (song) by Aishwarya Rai (best song of the movie) to look forward to. Great fun!",1190851200,,344,4.2272727272727275
2521643,5,B000EJ1VLE,"Bunty Aur Babli (Bunty And Babli) are the Bollywood equivalent of Bonnie and Clyde.  Both misunderstood by their families, and longing for more from life, Rakesh and Vimmi each leave home to follow their dreams.  Fate or circumstance brings them together.  Closed doors and corrupt dealings keep them together.  Frustrated after a bank manager steals his get rich scheme, Rakesh devises a plan to con the con man.  On the run, Rakesh and Vimmi become Bunty and Babli.  Thus begins an adventure that leads them from Lucknow to Delhi with many stops in between.

 The evolving relationship between the two main characters is enchanting, despite the nefarious nature of their partnership.  Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee have a wonderful chemistry as the engaging criminal couple.  Their characters are well developed, allowing the viewer to see beyond their unlawful behavior, to the warm-hearted souls that they truly are.  Bunty and Babli charm everyone they meet, including Deputy Commissioner of Police, Dashrath Singh (played by Amitabh Bachchan).  The film has elements of Catch Me if You Can, as DCP Singh tries to track them.

 Bunty repeats the aphorism ""Yeh world hai na world... Isme do tarah ke log hotey hai... (This world has two kinds of people . . . ) several times throughout the film.  It seems to have become almost a philosophy for him, in an effort, perhaps to make sense of a world that doesn't seem to understand him.

 I was drawn to this film after watching one of the musical numbers on You Tube.  Kajra Re is pure Bollywood song and dance, and the special appearance by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is the icing on the cake.  The songs in the film are captivating and memorable, and the incongruous sight of Amitabh Bachchan rapping during the end credits was a delightful end to the experience.  One of the most delightful and characteristic aspects of Bollywood films is the way in which the musical numbers can transport the characters into totally different settings, as a means to portray a particular emotion or event.

 As with most Bollywood films, it is quite long, at 170 minutes.  With non-stop action and song-and-dance numbers, I hardly noticed the time passing.  If you've never seen a Bollywood film, this one would be a great introduction.

 The one issue I had was the tendency of the subtitles to flash by too quickly, near the beginning of the film.  As the action began, this was much less of an issue, and did not detract from the enjoyability of the film.",1173657600,,2506,4.8352941176470585
2521644,5,B000EJ1VLE,"Gift reciepient thrilled.  Packaging very secure, shipping times as stated.  Would buy from seller again.",1169164800,,105,5.933333333333334
2521645,5,B000EJ1VLE,"I absolutely had to have Bunty aur Babli for Aishwarya Rai's sizzling cameo appearance in the musical number Kajra Re (a song which took India and my little piece of America by storm), but I really enjoyed this movie on its own merits.  Yes, the story is a tad far-fetched, but who cares?  This is Bollywood, after all.  We're talking great performances (including those of the formidable father-son tandem of Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan), incredible songs, and lots of laughs.  Rani Mukerji, an actress I was unfamiliar with, proved to be nothing short of delightful (even during her several crying jags).  This really is a movie you can enjoy over and over again.

Rakesh (Abhishek Bachchan) and Vimmi (Rani Mukerji) represent many a village youth who dream of thwarting tradition and finding wealth and fame in the big city.  Rakesh comes from Fursatganj in Uttar Pradesh, and he is a born schemer always on the make for a big idea.  Vimmi, from Pankinagar, dreams of being a supermodel and can't stand the thought of being forced into a marriage with someone she doesn't even like.  Both Rakesh and Vimmi decide to run away to realize their dreams, but their plans are quickly squashed in Lucknow.  Then fate draws them together, and Bunty and Babli are born.  Setting their sites on Bombay, they con a man who scammed Rakesh out of a lot of money in order to get the travel funds they need.  It doesn't stop there, though, as they fully embrace their Bunty and Babli personas, gaining widespread notoriety from all of the increasingly elaborate and highly profitable schemes they pull off.  They soon become cult heroes of a sort to the youth of the country, as even the most powerful of men and women fall victim to their daring plans.  They even succeed in ""leasing"" the Taj Mahal to a fabulously wealthy American businessman for his wedding.  They can be anyone or anybody, from real estate tycoons to tour guides to spiritual gurus to government ministers.  So, yes, they technically are desperately wanted criminals - but you can't help but love them as they run their scams, argue back and forth, and eventually fall in love.  One man who doesn't love them, though, is DCP Dasbrath Singh (Amitabh Bachchan), who devotes himself to bringing Bunty and Babli to justice.

The music of this film is amazing.  Kajra Re was a huge hit, but it's only one of several fantastic songs to be found here.  Dhadhak Dhadhak sets the stage of the main characters' optimism and determination to pursue their dreams, while the title track manages to epitomize their irresistible personalities.  As for just how big those dreams are, the elaborate Broadway-esque musical number Nach Baliye gives you a pretty good idea.  Nach Baliye doesn't get mentioned as much as the other musical numbers, but I absolutely love this infectiously energetic song.  Chup Chupke is a wonderful love song that beautifully frames Bunty and Babli's romantic relationship.  And, of course, there is there is the rap song B n B (performed by Blaaze), which features Amitabh ""Uncle D"" Bachchan in the promotional video that also runs alongside the closing credits.

Like many Bollywood releases, Bunty aur Babli features a bonus DVD full of wonderful extras.  This hours' worth of material includes the B n B video featuring Amitabh Bachchan, an MTV ""Making of"" look behind the scenes of the B n B video, a feature on ""The Making of Bunty aur Babli,"" a number of deleted scenes and outtakes, a look at the official music release for the film, a theatrical trailer, and a number of television promos.  It's just an embarrassment of riches that makes this a must-have item for any and all Bollywood fans.",1167350400,,3674,4.818181818181818
2521646,4,B000EJ1VLE,"Bunty aur Babli is the story of two small town kids with bigger aspirations.  They meet up while trying and failing to achieve their dreams.  The young man gets cheated out of his dream, so together they cheat the man who cheated them.  Taking on the pseudonyms Bunty and Babli, they travel around India, dressing up as various types and stereotypes, defrauding people of their money.

In real life, many of the scams the characters run would never work.  In real life, they would have been caught within a matter of months, because the would have been easily recognized.  Reel life in Bollywood, however, is a different matter.  The police officer trying to track them down says that nobody knows what they look like.  (Really, their disguises aren't that good).  But if you are willing to ignore these factors, the movie is a lot of fun to watch.

The acting by Abhishek Bachchan as Bunty is great, and his father, Amitabh, as the police officer is also great.  The film makes a couple of jokes about their real life relationship.  Rani Mukerji is a bit disappointing in this role.  She has done better.

The music, possibly the most important part of a film in this genre, is good fun.

One criticism about the DVD is that there are no Hindi subtitles.  This is true of almost all Hindi films.  What do hearing impaired Hindi speakers do?",1145491200,,1341,4.614406779661017
2521647,3,B000EJ1VLE,"I guess it was bound to happen. This is gonna be the first Bollywood film I'm rating as less than 5 stars ('course, I only started viewing Bollywood not more than 2 months ago). Bunty Aur Babli is a so-so film, about 2 and a half hours long, and is definitely more of a rental. Hated to say that because I'm becoming a fan of Abhishek Bachchan, whom I've seen in Kuch Naa Kaho and Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke, two most definitely superior movies.

So, the plot: Rakesh (Abhishek Bachchan) is a man determined to escape his humdrum, small-city life and opts to leave home when given an ultimatum by his father to either show up in a job interview or not come home at all. Rakesh, you see, has come up with the perfect business scheme, which he believes will propel him to immediate financial success. Meet also Vimmi (Rani Mukerji), who wants more of life than to become a typical arranged bride and thus runs away, pursuing her dream to become Miss India. Both of these young hopefuls' plans go awry. Then they meet and Rakesh and Vimmi become Bunty and Babli, scammers extraordinaire, bilking people of their riches and then sharing the wealth with the poor and downtrodden. Halfway thru the film enters Dashrath Singh, a stoic, bulldog of a policeman played in full taciturn glory by iconic actor and Abhishek's father, Amitabh Bachchan. The remainder of the film tells of DCP Singh's frustrated attempts to capture the carefree criminals, who had by then become modern day legends.

This is my first time watching Amitabh Bachchan, who is big in India and, frankly, I found him only serviceable, as I did the rest of the cast. I've noted that I've become a fan of young Abhishek Bachchan, but in this effort, while he doesn't embarass himself, I feel that he isn't as good as he was in the other movies I've seen; Rani Mukerji is cute fluff, whose acting is basically good here but who, at one point, annoyed me with her incessant, unconvincing crying. Incidentally, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but this might be the first movie that both the Bachchans have been in.

The musical numbers, I must admit, took turns in alternately grating on my nerves or boring me to a clock-watching frenzy (""isn't this dang song over yet, already?""). There are only 2 musical numbers I enjoyed. One (""B & B) takes place in the closing credits, with an MTV-like video of the elder Bachchan portraying his policeman character rapping/lipsynching in English - it cracked me up. The other one is the penultimate number, ""Kajra Re"" (Night Eyes), a specialty item featuring Aishwarya Rai, wherein she engages the two Bachchans in a smoking dancefest - very cool, with Aish very hot. Three minutes of this lovely creature will make the viewer forget all about the movies's female lead, old what's-her-face? To be utterly honest, Ms. Rai is the main reason I purchased this movie and, yup indeedy, she raises my eval of this flick from an initial 2 and a half stars to a full 3 stars. Someday I plan to marry her and then we'll reside in a glorious castle on the moon.

To sum up, Bunty Aur Babli is a good-natured, pleasant enough viewing experience, with no airs of self-importance or grandeur. It cheerfully knows what it is and hams itself up to the hilt. It won't challenge your mind or tug at your emotions. It definitely won't make you think or fall into a deep reverie. But if you've got nothing better to do one evening, pop this musical-comedy dvd in, sit back, suspend critical judgement as hard as you can (remember, this is Bollywood), fastforward thru the musical numbers if they get to be too much, and be gentle  on the actors. They're all better than this movie.",1143417600,,3656,4.618461538461538
