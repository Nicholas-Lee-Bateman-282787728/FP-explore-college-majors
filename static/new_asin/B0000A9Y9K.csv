1904022,5,B0000A9Y9K,My one year old granddaughter loves this DVD. It is her favorite. I turn it on and she grins from ear to ear and squeals. LOL  Love it.,1361491200,,135,3.8214285714285716
1904023,5,B0000A9Y9K,Very cute story and keeps my 5 year old's attention.  Loves the music and learning all the other characters names and personalities. Great buy!,1360540800,,143,4.958333333333333
1904024,5,B0000A9Y9K,"This is a great movie! My daughter watches this movie like its going out of style! Good, clean, innocent strawberry shortcake.",1357171200,,126,5.0476190476190474
1904025,5,B0000A9Y9K,"Very cute movie, good story and morals. Nice story about giving to others. My 2.75 yr. old loves this era of Strawberry Shortcake, as do I. It is tolerable for the parents to watch, not like some kids movies.",1354060800,,208,4.358974358974359
1904026,3,B0000A9Y9K,"This show must have been one of the first ones made by DIC in 2003 because the quality is poor compared to the other SS shows I have on DVD. The sound was not mastered and so it gets louder and quieter and is not consistent. The animation is not as sophisticated looking. The lines are too heavy and their noses look too big. The voices are slightly different as well. I'm not sure if my 3 year old daughter will notice but she might. Also the story is all about shopping so I'd say its fairly shallow. That said I love almost all the other DVD's for Strawberry Shortcake in this series, and my daughter loves them too. I bet she will like this but maybe not quite as much as the others we have...",1352851200,,697,4.132352941176471
1904027,3,B0000A9Y9K,"I bought this for my almost 4 year old since she's in a Strawberry Shortcake phase right now.  She's loved several of the other DVD's, especially Cooking up Fun, the Seaberry one, and the Big Country Fun, but this one she didn't even make it all the way through before wandering off in boredom.  She was so excited to see a Christmas Strawberry Shortcake, but it's mostly just Strawberry and, of all characters, Honey Pie (the mouthy pony) wandering around looking for gifts.  It would have been much more interesting if the other characters were around to interact as friends and liven things up a bit more.",1292630400,,608,4.663551401869159
1904028,4,B0000A9Y9K,"I commented on another post about how there is no mention of Jesus in this. I didn't really expect there would be. Aside from that, it is a cute DVD. The songs are sweet and catchy. I do like how they talk about friendship. It is cute, very girly.",1281139200,,247,4.061224489795919
1904029,5,B0000A9Y9K,This was a movie that my twelve year old has asked for since she was nine.  I finally bought it as a Christmas Present to be added to our family Christmas Movie collection.  She was not disappointed.  She loves it.,1263600000,,214,4.3
1904030,5,B0000A9Y9K,My daughter always loved Strawberry Shortcake when she was growing up. Stawberry Shortcake never gets old. My daughter and grandchildren love to watch her.,1262563200,,155,5.5
1904031,5,B0000A9Y9K,This is a great DVD for Strawberry Shortcake lovers.  It is the usual Strawberry Shortcake DVD with singing and cute stories.  My daughter loves this DVD.,1252627200,,154,4.884615384615385
1904032,4,B0000A9Y9K,I purchased this for Christmas day entertainment.  It's nice to have some wholesome offerings for youngsters. My niece loved it - the Strawberry scent on the packaging is very clever. Good purchase.,1231459200,,198,5.1875
1904033,4,B0000A9Y9K,"My three yr old girl loved this dvd. It was a fun Christmas movie and it was age appropriate, not 'scary' like The Polar Express or some of the other cartoons for kids.",1231200000,,168,4.121212121212121
1904034,5,B0000A9Y9K,"I could not find this item in our local area, and it was a birthday request from a 6 year old granddaughter.  I was very happy to find it on Amazon.com  I'm sure she enjoyed the DVD, but hadn't opened the gift last time I spoke with her.",1229904000,,237,3.9166666666666665
1904035,4,B0000A9Y9K,"I bought this for my 22-month-old granddaughter Audrey thinking she might sit through it once or twice now and would grow to really like it as she gets a bit older.  Her mother (my daughter) was quite the SS fan when she was about 4 and 5.  Well, Audrey sat through it all right... and again...and again...and again...you get the picture!  She absolutely LOVES this movie and thinks her world is falling apart if someone tries to turn it off! :)  I haven't quite figured out why it's so appealing to her when I'm pretty sure she's not really following the story line (since she doesn't talk yet except for a few first words) but she loves it enough that sometimes (if mama allows) she will watch it back to back 4 or 5 times in a row!  So I told my daughter (who still likes SS but not quite THAT much!) that I'm buying Audrey 3 more SS DVD's for Christmas -- so at least they don't have to listen to the same one over and over again!  Having read the other reviews here, it seems to me that this little adorable gal appeals to a wide variety of age groups -- but I just wanted to assure the parents/grandparents of the VERY young that they too will probably love it!",1228780800,,1167,4.2342342342342345
1904036,4,B0000A9Y9K,"As every parent of a young child will agree, kids go through multiple phases, and my 3.5 year-old is currently in her fairy and SS phase:) Well, we've been going through quite a few SS DVDs, but she enjoys them so much, and I make it a point of watching them with her, and it's been quite entertaining.

In ""Berry Merry Christmas"", SS wishes to get special, meaningful gifts for her friends in Strawberryland and together with Honey Pie Pony, they travel to Holiday Land, a magical place in search of the perfect holiday gifts. There are some great lessons in this DVD - of the joy of giving rather than receiving, of how important friendship is [more so than presents] and of course of treasuring quality time in the company of good friends. I'd recommend watching this with your little one on a cold winter's day in anticipation of the holidays! Oh, there's a special music video included on this DVD too.",1224806400,,907,4.564417177914111
1904037,4,B0000A9Y9K,"We've bought nearly every Strawberry DVD that's out so far, and this one is my daughter's favorite. I'm a little hesitant to compliment the animation, but the story is very cute. And, as with every strawberry shortcake movie, we've watched it over and over. If you're looking for a movie with a good Christmas base, and your child already loves Strawberry Shortcake, I'd definitely recommend it.",1197849600,,395,5.0
1904038,3,B0000A9Y9K,"My girls love Strawberry Shortcake and I was excited to find out that on this DVD Strawberry Shortcake tells the Christmas story - the real one! I couldn't believe it. Well I was a little disappointed when I discovered that it was tucked away in a special feature. My disappointment turned to disgust when the wise men went to Bethlehem to find ""the first Christmas gift."" No mention of Jesus - Political correctness at its worst.",1134000000,,430,4.671052631578948
1904039,5,B0000A9Y9K,"My granddaughter received this SS DVD for St. Nicholas Day. Kiersten enjoys watching Christmas movies and Strawberry Shortcake and this DVD combines both. Strawberry goes shopping to find the perfect gifts for her friends and pets which leads to her meeting some interesting characters. The gifts get accidentally ruined on her return trip home but she learns being with friends and family is what is important,not what you give them. Even though as in all the SS DVD's the dialogue is sugary sweet it is bearable. Watch this Strawberry during the holiday season with your child/grandchild. You'll like it.",1134000000,,606,5.1313131313131315
1904040,5,B0000A9Y9K,Very sweet holiday cheer from Strawberry and all her friends-sweet Christmas songs and situations with Santa Claus-would recommend it.,1104969600,,134,6.105263157894737
1904041,5,B0000A9Y9K,"My 3 year old loves Strawberry Shortcake.  These DVDs keep her entertained and are just the right length so I can finish dinner and keep an eye on her.

I find it refreshing that this progam is populated with children voiced by children. So many cartoons have children voiced by adults using falsetto and I, personally, find that a little creepy.

My little girl loves singing along with the characters in her sweet, OFF-KEY voice and for that the DVD is worth twice the price I paid for it.

The fact is that this is a DVD for small children and it's bright colors and simple storylines it hits the mark.",1076371200,,605,4.423423423423423
1904042,5,B0000A9Y9K,"My daughter absolutely loves Strawberry Shortcake as much as I did when I was growing up! We already owned Meet Strawberry Shortcake and Springtime for Strawberry Shortcake, and she watches them over and over and over again all day long. I find myself singing the songs in the shower! So, when I saw that there is now a Christmas movie, I had to get it for her! And I'm glad that I did because she loves it just as much as the other two. It is full of great Christmas scenery and catchy little Christmas songs (there is also a soundtrack to this movie that you can buy for all of the Christmas songs). The story is about Strawberry Shortcake and all of her friends at Christmas time. Strawberry finds herself stuck in the dilemma of what to get for each of her friends - she wants to get everyone the absolute PERFECT gift. All of the main characters are in this movie.  It's a must have for any Strawberry Shortcake fan!
I'm kind of tired of hearing people saying that it doesn't live up to the Strawberry Shortcake of the past. I grew up watching and playing with the old Strawberry Shortcake, and although it has changed slightly, it is only a little bit in a appearance. They are better quality and a little bit more modernized... so what??? I don't understand what the big deal is. And it's not like little girls now even know the difference, so who cares? They are great movies! Especially this one! There is also a music video at the end that my daughter loves to dance to!",1068940800,,1480,4.381818181818182
1904043,2,B0000A9Y9K,"If you enjoyed the classic Strawberry Shortcake videos (e.g., ""World of Strawberry Shortcake"") and were excited about the new series of videos, you might be disappointed that the new videos have very little in common with the classics other than the name.  In my opinion, the changes are for the worse.
Many of the classic characters have either changed or are no longer present.  The beloved benefactor Mr. Sun as well as the evil Purple Pieman no longer make an appearance (more about this later).  The personality of the remaining characters also change.  In the classic videos, the character portrayal is deeper, while the characters in the new videos have rather stereotyped one-dimensional personalities.
The classic videos spoke about the human condition in a way that could move our hearts.  We sympathized with the Purple Pieman's love for pie.  In him, we could see our own struggles of the flesh.  We longed for the innocence of Strawberry Shortcake; yet we feared that innocence would be lost to malice.  We applauded when Mr. Sun saved the day, and we found relief in the knowledge that an all-powerful being would make every situation work out for the good of those who love.  In the end, Purple Pieman found redemption in the berry fellowship of friendship, and we saw that even the most lost among us could be brought back.
In comparison, ""Berry Merry Christmas"" is sanitized, with no deeper struggles or longings than that of the last-minute Christmas shopper.  There are some sugar-coated lessons about friendship but these reflect simple ignorance rather than truly heartfelt struggles.  Shortcake videos aim to be sweet, but this video is purely empty calories with no nutritional content.",1066608000,,1709,5.0462633451957295
