2114248,2,B0002PYSTW,"Typical 'B' western from 1953.  But fans of the original Superman TV show should note that the cast includes Phyllis Coates (Lois Lane), John Hamilton (Perry White), and Robert Shayne (Inspector Henderson).",1409961600,,206,5.4375
2114249,5,B0002PYSTW,"I enjoyed this western. It has all the things I enjoy in a western. Riding after the bad guys, the good guys win, yet it was highly entertaining.",1409011200,,145,4.214285714285714

2114251,3,B0002PYSTW,"Good action hero. Had solid screen presence. He was likeable, and kids could
trust his persona on screen. He never let them down. His message and character
stood out most of the time in his films.",1380067200,2,196,4.472222222222222
2114252,1,B0002PYSTW,"the movie is fine, but the producing company has put out a product that stinks.....the picture looks like it was filmed in a theater.....the sound fades in or out and at times is garbled..  I have bought other movies from this company and the results are always the same.....awful...can't this company spend some money to clean up their products?  Guess I'm slow but no more movies from this company for me.",1098057600,12,407,4.71830985915493
2114253,4,B0002PYSTW,"This western saga has Rocky Lane tracking down an escaped convict hoping to find the hidden loot. As it truns out, the escaped convict not only is innocent, but helps Rocky Lane uncover a fiendish plot to swindle farmers out of their land before the railroad gets to Cedar Rock. Marshal of Cedar Rock is the 36th entry in the Rocky Lane series of 38 features. By the time it was made (1953) Republic had cut the length of these movies from 60 minutes down to 54 minutes. Rocky Lane movies were different from the Autrys and Rogers in that they had no music or love interest. Just action throughout. The tape has a clear picture that will look even better if you enable the soft picture mode on your VCR. for $9.99 Marshal of Cedar rock is a gem you want to miss!",1089244800,5,762,4.298611111111111
2114285,5,B0002PYSTW,It's a classic 50s movie.  I enjoy them very much and wish they were available to watch more often.,1474848000,,99,4.2105263157894735
2114286,5,B0002PYSTW,"Always a fan of these early 'B' Westerns, but the plots and execution of the stories of the Alan 'Rocky' Lane movies are usually a few steps above most of the others in this genre. When Rocky's plan to have a convict escape to follow him back to try and catch the others works, he ends up learning more than he bargained for. The cast delivers realistic performances, and the watcher can believe the story true. Roy Barcroft excels as the villain, giving Waller and Lane a great performance to play off of. This is one I have enjoyed watching more than one.",1474848000,,557,4.41747572815534

2114293,4,B0002PYSTW,"Rocky Lane was one of the biggest, if not the biggest, Western stars of Republic Studios
back in the late '40's and early '50's. These films were aimed at the Saturday Matinee crowd, and
always promised plenty of action, and fun, watching Rocky and Nugget Clark outwit Roy Barcroft,
Gene Roth, and others. Pop some corn and sit back and enjoy!",1459209600,,343,4.639344262295082

Our agreements with the content provider don't allow purchases at this time"". Hopefully Amazon and it's ""content provider"" will reach a new agreement soon or a lot of Prime members will be exiting.  Also notice scores of classic (40's, 50's) Paramount action movies (eg.
