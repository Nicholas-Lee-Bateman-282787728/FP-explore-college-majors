2398085,5,B000AYELAQ,"Hallelujah!  The release of one of the most incredible mini-series ever is fast approaching.  I can only hope that ""The Adams Chronicles"" is not far behind!

I give this DVD-set my highest recommendation.  The fine acting, the beautiful score, and the fact that it's based on a true story would merit five stars alone.  The wonderful lessons in history and humanity that it provides makes ""Backstairs at the White House"" a MUST for everyone's video library!",1130112000,10,457,4.9605263157894735
2398086,5,B000AYELAQ,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  I have been waiting for years for this series to become available.  I have both books and have read and re-read them many times.  This is a wonderful mini-series and a fantastic cast and is too long in coming.  If you like American history and want an insight to the ways behind the scenes and the lives of our Presidents, you will enjoy this movie.",1130112000,16,383,4.352112676056338
2398087,5,B000AYELAQ,This is definitely one of the finest tv miniseries ever.  I have waited for it to come out for 25 years and finally it is here!! Thank Goodness since the movies on tv these days are so pathetic!!  I hope this will either give the studios incentive to release more of these treasures of the past or to create new ones for all of us to enjoy.,1128297600,19,340,4.059701492537314
2398088,5,B000AYELAQ,"I saw this mini-series as a teenager and was facinated by it. It is clearly one of my favorite movies. I found a copy recently that someone had taped off of TV when it aired on NBC and was reminded of what a great historical treasure it was. But the quality of the 25 year old VHS tape was so poor that I am very greatful that the mini-series is coming out on DVD. Miss Cole and Miss Uggams give wonderful performances as Maggie and Lillian Rogers, mother and daughter who worked in the white house during the first half of the 20th century.",1128211200,10,541,4.211538461538462
2398089,5,B000AYELAQ,This is perhaps the BEST miniseries ever made.  It's about time it has finally been released for all of us who have been searching for this for over 20 years!  I plan to get this IMMEDIATELY!  This is one series that needs to be shown to schools because it is so great!  I just thank God for getting this released finally.  Viewers will never see so many great actors assembled together as in this.,1127174400,15,398,4.324324324324325
2398090,5,B000AYELAQ,"With all the attention people give The West Wing (I should talk, I've bought them all here), and big screen comedies like The American President (I own that too), here's a REAL look at the White House of the first half of the 20th Century.  Olivia Cole stars as Maggie Rogers, a black woman with 2 kids, and a constantly disappearing husband, who gets a job as a maid at ""ole 1600"" at the beginning of the Taft administration.  Leslie Uggams plays the adult version of her daughter Lillian, and between the 2 of them they see the ins and outs of the first families all the way til Kennedy's inauguration.  An all star cast of known tv and movie stars, portray the Tafts, Wilsons, Hardings, Coolidges, Hoovers, Roosevelts, Trumans and Eisenhowers, as well as other maids, butlers, chauffers, etc.  If you think ""The West Wing"" gives a great look, at the staffers during an administration, get this classic mini series which you will see the oval through the eyes of the ""permanent"" staff.  Screenplay written Paul Dubov and Gwen Bagni based on their novel which in turn is based on the real Lillian Rogers own autobiography ""My 30 Years Backstairs At The White House"".  Since VCRs were invented, I thought this series was long gone.  When The History Channel was born, I thought it would get a new lease on life.  Now 25 years later it finally has, Thank you, NBC for finally giving the rights to a local (to me at least) video manufacturer like Acorn to release a DVD copy.  I will NOT let this one get away from me.:-)",1126483200,121,1519,4.534798534798535
2398091,5,B000AYELAQ,"The release of this DVD is LONG overdue. It is EXCELLENT. Based on the books My 30 Years Backstairs at the White House and Backstairs at the White House it's the lives, trials and celebrations of the first families from President Taft's administration through to the Kennedy inauguration as told by a mother-daughter team of White House staff workers.

No, it's not a scandalous expose as one would expect in this 21st century but rather the historical and human sides of the White House residents and staff within the walls of the executive mansion.

First aired as a 4 or 5 night mini-series in I believe 1979, it has stuck in my memory for these many years!

Again, well worth it and too long overdue.",1124755200,26,704,4.616

2398097,5,B000AYELAQ,"This was a TV mini-series which followed the highly successful ""Roots"" in the late 1970's.  I loved it then and still do, it is great to have the set.  It portrays the White House from the perspective of the permanent staff that serviced the Presidents.  It presents the Presidents as real people and is very educational from that perspective.  It is interesting to see these families from the staff's point of view.  Some of the portrayals seem counter to as they are portrayed historically.  Two that stick out for me is Woodrow Wilson and particularly his first wife, and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

A must see for anyone who loves Presidential History and entertaining even for those who are not particularly interested in this subject.",1487894400,2,735,4.879032258064516

2398099,5,B000AYELAQ,Backstairs at the White House is one of the great unsung brilliant made for TV movies of all time.  The DVD was every bit as good as I remember the original broadcast being.,1482364800,,173,4.242424242424242

2398101,5,B000AYELAQ,This is hands down one of the best movies ever.  This is something that everyone should see.  It is a lost movie that needs to be publicized more.,1479772800,,146,4.178571428571429
2398102,5,B000AYELAQ,Excellent DVD and informational if you are a history buff!/!,1478736000,,60,5.1
2398103,5,B000AYELAQ,"I loved this DVD series. I've watched it dozens of times. The actors resemblance to the actual characters is uncanny. My only complaint is the grossly ridiculous Overacting of Leslie Uggams. She nearly ruins the series with her absurd head motions & artificial facial expressions & literally overdoing everything. Any actress to replace her would have been an improvement.

However, the magnificent acting, makeup & costumes with all the other actors is so superb that they more than make up for everything Uggams does to ruin her character. If the real Lillian Rogers behaved like Uggams, then she was long overdue for a spanking.  Uggams is clearly full of herself & grossly self concentric to the max.

Olivia Cole also does an excellent job keeping Uggams in line. Uggams does this gross overacting in every role she ever played. Remember Kizzy on Roots? She had no business being in acting. Stand up Comedy is more in her line. I suspect she failed to follow any directors instructions & overwhelmed everyone she worked with.

Regardless, you will never be sorry you bought this series. It is quite wonderful. All the actors except Uggams were outstanding & riveting in their roles. You will feel like you are actually seeing the genuine first families and their real personalities. They bring these little known presidents to life for those of us who were not alive at the time. This series should be required for all students. It is also very educational about the times & major events of each administration.",1466899200,,1516,4.91015625

I loved it and am so glad that I found that they had made CD's of the whole story. It is a classic and a wonderful history lesson about the presidents and how blacks were treated at those times in history. It is a lesson for all to see. There is nothing harsh or mean about this story and recommend it for all. I even recommend it to be watched in schools. There is nothing wrong with it for Blacks or Whites in this day and age.

I purchased the book a while ago that the mini series is loosely based from. I have enjoyed both items although they differ in many ways. The book was a much more serious retelling of the memoirs while the TV mini series, as often happens, added more drama for viewing entertainment.",1389398400,,425,4.605263157894737
2398186,5,B000AYELAQ,I watched this as a tv mini-series back in the 1970's and loved it. I purchased it about 10 years ago through research as it wasn't easily available at that time and spent close to $200.00 for the set. After wearing it out I decided not to purchase it again at such a high price. Luckily I found it on Amazon and a great steal. A must have for History Buffs.,1388102400,,358,4.056338028169014

2398189,5,B000AYELAQ,I had this mini series on tape since I first saw it and looked at it many times. Finally was able to get it on DVD and thrilled to have it. It is not only a good look at first families over that period of time but it is an excellent picture of the White House staff and how an African American family managed to survive during those times. The cast and all the role portrayals are wonderful. It holds the interest start to finish. I can't recommend it highly enough.,1384214400,2,466,4.131868131868132

Because of Lillian Parks book on this subject, White House staff after her book came out had to sign an affidavit that they would not write books or movies about what goes on at the White House.

2398217,5,B000AYELAQ,Good ensemble acting.  Two of my favorite actors cavort with clout: Ed Flanders and my dear Victor Buono.  The movie itself teaches (and entertains) with affection and intelligence.  Violence?  Nary a slap to the face.  Good family fare.  The story of the backstairs folks at the White House is an Upstairs/Downstairs done USA style.,1367366400,,333,5.074074074074074

2398237,4,B000AYELAQ,"Backstairs at the White House is a very good 70's era miniseries of White House life as seen through the eyes of the staff.  It covers a lot of ground so some details are a little sketchy but I did end up learning some things about lesser-known presidents Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge and Hoover.  I've seen a number of movies about FDR and Truman so I was much more familiar with them.  Dwight Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie, were shown in a less than favorable light and didn't seem to have the rapport with their staff that the other presidents ended up having.

At any rate, this is a good miniseries with a lot of well-known actors and actresses including Olivia Cole (excellent at Maggie Rogers), Cloris Leachman (as the snarky Mrs. Jaffrey), Louis Gossett, Jr. and Robert Hooks as Levi Mercer and Mays (two good friends of Maggie's) and countless other stars representing the First Families.  If you can get past Leslie Uggams' constant grinning (which really gets on your nerves after a while), she does a good job of portraying Lillian Rogers Parks on whose memoirs the series was based.

This is a good investment in the kind of TV miniseries that are, for the most part, sadly missing from today's television productions.  What makes it even better, there's no gratuitous sex, nudity or bad language and it still--surprise, surprise--manages to be an exceptional series.  No wonder it was nominated for 11 Emmy Awards.",1348531200,2,1432,4.7926829268292686

2398249,5,B000AYELAQ,This was an excellent movie when it aired and still is.

2398255,5,B000AYELAQ,"Backstairs At The White House is a Joy to watch from start to finish, the casting is superb and all the characters are believable.  I love history - but for those who don't - this is an easy way to learn about the past while enjoying a good film.  Leslie Uggams and Olivia Cole play the mother and daughter who work at the White House - they watch what occurs across the years as Presidents come and go (William Howard Taft - Woodrow Wilson - Warren G. Harding - Calvin Coolidge - Herbert Hoover - Franklin D. Roosevelt - Harry Truman - Dwight Eisenhower) It is surprising how much we learn about each President and his family - we share the joy and the sorrow of events that effect the various Presidents, we begin to understand them and feel sympathy for them.  The video is excellent and the sound is very good - you don't have to keep readjusting it. When Backstairs at the White House ends - you wish it could go on and on - to Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon etc.  All the Presidents are played by well known actors - don't miss this one!",1276387200,3,1036,4.270408163265306

Contrast between the old and new guard is really shown. It does give you the feeling of what it would be like working at the White House and dealing with the different personalities of the First Family.

The problem is highlighted when the two share the screen, however the disparity dissipates somewhat as the pair ages. What a cast of good looking black men who can also act! Robert Hooks (and his son Kevin), Lou Gossett,and Bill Overton lead of cast of the most handsome black servants ever seen on screen. The supporting cast of Presidential families and white servants show how pathetic and fragile whites in the White House really were. Cloris Leachman did a particularly outstanding job as the bitch...I hated her! I can't help resenting every U. S. President for the way they treat their black servants...and African Americans in general. I only hope the Obama(s) are doing a better job in showing respecting to their servants.

  I had read that the television series was not available for purchase due to legalities of ownership and other reasons. I was searching one day on Amazon.

I purchased it and even then it took me a couple of weeks before I watched it.  This mini series ranks up there with the best of them.  They have done a great job to keep the politics out of it and only casually mentions the important scandals and events.  It focuses mainly on the life of the servants in the white house.  That doesn't sound exciting but the story draws you in so you really care about the people involved.  If you are thinking about buying this mini series do it.

2398275,5,B000AYELAQ,"Backstairs at the White House was incredibly enjoyable.  The acting was super and the perspective very interesting.  It is the true account of a woman and her daughter who worked in the White House from the time President Taft took office until President Kennedy was elected.  It chronicles the personal ups and downs of the presidential families and their respective interactions with the staff.

I laughed. I cried. I learned many personal facts about these presidents and their family members that I otherwise never would have known.  I realized the struggles they faced in living such a public life and having to carry the weight of many heavy decisions.

I will definitely watch this mini-series over and over again, as well as share it with friends and family. I will say, it depicted quite well the change in the attitude of our society in general when it showed that a once united in friendship staff was now aloof from one another and the family they served.  A sad statement, indeed.

Highly recommend this as a family viewing - multiple times.",1256774400,2,1054,4.816666666666666

This is a story of a 'family' in any sense who worked at the White House.  The woman its mainly about worked through 8 presidents as a maid and eventually became a supervisor and her daughter worked there as well and wrote her biography.  It covers so much history, from World War I, through the swinging 20's in to the Great Depression, FDR and through to JFK Inauguration.  It focuses on the African Americans who served behind the scenes for the most part in keeping the President and his families secrets and caring for them through some of the most difficult adminstrations and times in American History.  From when discrimination was still rampant and the 'hired help' had to come in the backdoor and not be seen.
The cast is the best! Leslie Uggams, Louis Gossett Jr (with hair!) and many others.  I think PBS should bring this series back again.",1232064000,,1006,4.555555555555555

2398293,5,B000AYELAQ,"People could actually walk by the White House separated
only by a black iron fence. This mini-series covers
the presidencies of Taft through Eisenhowe snd includes
the great events such as the Teapot Dome Scandal, WWI,
The Great Depression and WWII. Interwoven are the lives
of the staff who work at the White House and truly own
it as they welcome in and bid farewell to each First
Family. The drama settles on Maggie Rogers, the first
African-American maid to work in the White House quarters,
and her daughter Lillian, a talented seamstress who is
lame as a result of polio. FDR sees that he and Lillian
have this affliction in common and makes sure that
Lillian always has the use of the elevator in the
family quarters.
Olivia Cole and Leslie Uggams head an excellent cast
that includes Leslie Nielsen, Louis Gossett, Jr.,
Robert Hooks and Cloris Leachman. Actors playing
roles as First Family menbers include Julie Harris,
Robert Vaughn and Eileen Heckart. Particularly
poignant, I thought, are the episodes covering
the death of the Coolidges' young son and the
tragic, scandal-ridden administration of Warren
Harding. Celeste Holm plays his heartbroken
First Lady.

2398296,5,B000AYELAQ,"I remember watching this mini-series back in 1979 and I am so pleased to see it out on DVD now. In 1909, Maggie Rogers is hired at the White House as a maid to the Presidents family. She is the first African-American woman to hold this key position. Not much of a job considering the long hours, low wages and primadonna like behaviour of some of the President's and their families. The cast is superb and you come to care about each individual staff member as they endure personal tragedies while trying to maintain their jobs. The timeframe is 1909-1961 so there are two world wars, the depression and many other significant events of our history that are covered. Leslie Uggams, is brilliantly cast as Maggie's daughter Lillian who is proud, headstrong and sassy, traits that often drive her poor mother crazy but they love and support one another through life's tribulations in this turbulent era of war and poverty. Lillian starts working at the White House in 1931 because of her incredible skills as a seamstress. She had polio as a child and is left using a crutch for the rest of her life. As each President comes and goes we are treated to glimpses of their personalities. The Hoover's and the Eisenhower's are  my least favorite inhabitants due to their vain and rather vapid approach to dealing with the staff. I highly recommend this tender sometimes heartbreaking, many times joyful account of life in the White House in the early years of the 20th century as seen through the eyes of two strong and very classy ladies.",1206316800,5,1533,4.698884758364312
2398297,5,B000AYELAQ,I found the DVD of Backstairs at the White House an excellent portrayal of several presidential administrations.  It was also an eye-opener to how the servants were treated and to the quirks of the various presidents and first ladies.,1202428800,,234,5.0
2398298,5,B000AYELAQ,"Would recommend to anyone who likes good drama and wants to learn about the last century in the white house.  This is not straight history, but is told from a human view point of the little man or the servants who work in the White House.  Acting is inspired and though  I doubt if the First Family actually interacted that much with the staff, it is still a sweet story suitable for the whole family.",1191110400,,401,4.32
2398299,5,B000AYELAQ,"I've been looking for Backstairs at the White House on video for years and was so happy to find it at Amazon.  Though it had been nearly 30 years since I had seen it, I remembered a number of the deails vividly.  It did not disappoint.  I thought I had watched this on network television when I was in high school, but the release date is listed as 1979 - is this correct?  I thought it was closer to 1973-74.  Since my daughter is now living and working in Washington, D.C., watching it again was of particular interest.  I am also reading The President's House, by Margaret Truman, which I would recommend as an excellent companion to the video.",1190678400,,647,4.394957983193278
2398300,5,B000AYELAQ,"Backstairs at the White House came out when I was just a kid and I've never forgotten the impact it had on my young life.  It was amazing to see how things worked at the White House from the servants point of view.  It was honest and refreshing to learn the truth without all the political nonsense that goes with it!  I would recommend this movie to anyone.

I had been looking for this for YEARS and it was by chance that I discovered it just randomly searching on Amazon.  I didn't hesitate to buy it. The acting, writing, directing et al....remarkable! Olivia Cole and Leslie Uggams at the top of their games.  This one will be special for me, particularly when I recall the memory of seeing with Nana, who has since passed on.  Thank you, NBC.",1188777600,2,512,4.3578947368421055
2398302,5,B000AYELAQ,I remember this series back when it was premiered in the 70's. I loved it then and wanted to see it again but never found it scheduled.  I was thrilled to see it reissued in DVD. Watching it brought back so many memories and I found it still had the charm and splendid acting I remembered from so many years ago. Seeing behind the closed doors of the White House gave a glimpse of a part of history we never see.  I highly recommend it.,1181347200,,436,4.117647058823529
2398303,5,B000AYELAQ,"I watched this mini-series when it orignally aired in 1979 when I was 10 years old.  It aired over serveral weeks and my family would gather around the TV to watch it.  I have been talking about this series since I was ten and have been dying to see again.  I cannot tell you how excited I was to see that it had been released on DVD.  The minute that I discovered it, I placed my order.  It is a great piece of history, with a great cast and I urge everyone to see it.",1179100800,2,469,3.8947368421052633
2398304,5,B000AYELAQ,This is an excellent series for people of all ages.  It is an interesting look at all of the personalities who lived in the White House throughout the years.

It is a great story for the whole family. It is an example that history is not just made by the famous and powerful alone, they were helped and supported by many whose names we will never know.",1168300800,6,351,4.101449275362318
2398320,5,B000AYELAQ,"Backstairs at the White House is a delightful and entertaining production about a little known aspect of White House life, that of the servants and staff. It is based on the book by Lillian Rogers Parks and covers five decades of White House life and eight Administrations. The focus is on the lives of Maggie Rogers and her daughter, Lillian Rogers Parks. The sets are beautiful, though somewhat repetitious. The Characters are well developed and acted. Over the 400+ minutes I really got to know them and was sad to say goodbye as the series ended. The series is informative and entertaining. It should also be of great interest to those seeking to learn more of African American History or to learn more about life behind the scenes at the White House.",1163030400,3,755,4.7272727272727275

2398322,5,B000AYELAQ,"Having missed this mini-series when it was first aired on television in 1979, I searched for years for a VHS or DVD version without success.  Finally, I was able to purchase a poor-quality copy in 2003 from a private owner who had recorded it on his VCR at the time of its original television broadcast.  Because of technical distortions stemming from amateurish recording techniques, however, much of the sound and some of the visual components of the production were diminished.  As such, I was thrilled to discover that a DVD set had been recently produced and released.  Now, more than two decades later, I finally can enjoy this wonderful mini-series at its technical best; and, with its fine cast and excellent story development, it was well worth the wait!",1154476800,3,763,4.891472868217054

2398327,5,B000AYELAQ,"This was one of the best looks at how the White House works behind the scenes. This is a true documentary story that told of what it was like to live as servants under six administrations, This story is told by a real servant that served over thirty years at the White House.  The story is told in a four disc set, each approximately two hours long, for a total of eight hours.

I especially liked the way it was broken down to 2 hours each, you didn't get too tired of watching.  I remember watching this on television back in the later 1970's, as a mini-series.  My wife and I ejoyed it so much we couldn't wait to find a copy.  We searched for a copy of this, and were unable to find one until this year in CD.  This has been a real treasure for us, and I know this will be very interesting for others.  We very highly reccommend this story.

It's a wonderful series and my whole family loves it - from my 84 year old Mom to my 9 year old nephew. Excuse me - 9 and almost a half, I'm told!

I have a very poor copy of a VHS tape from it's only one viewing on the air but it was better than nothing to have.  This series was so wonderful that I immediately went out and bought Gwen Bagini's book with the same title.  Gwen worked on it with Mrs. Parks too.  Both the book and the mini series was so wonderful.  It really showed what went on behind the scenes.  The way the writers incorporated that into the film was laudable.  I loved this series when I first saw it and I love it just as well today.  This mini series has brought back a lot of nice memories for me.  This series was one of the last series that I watched with my Mom right before she passed away, she loved it too.  I was reading Gwen's book to her when she passed.  I know she would have liked to have seen this new fangled stuff of DVD's.  This one is a sure fire winner and well worth the price.  Actually the price is very reasonable for a mini series.

He had the Lincoln bed all set up for her. But She was a Reb that had been sent out of her home with order number 11. So she refused to sleep in that bed.

I would have not known this part if I had not heard someone speak about President Truman and his family. But I thought the movie was good.",1140134400,4,449,3.880434782608696
2398342,5,B000AYELAQ,"I ordered this DVD as a result of a vague memory from years ago.  I was delighted when I received the DVD.  Watching the performances of Olivia Cole and Leslie Uggams (among others) held my wife and I spellbound for three consecutive evenings.

The account is told first from the perspective of Maggie (Olivia Cole) who comes to work in the White House in the Taft Administration.  As time goes by, her daughter is drawn into the domestic staff of the White House, first as a part time seamstress, and finally as a maid during the Hoover administration.  The portrayals of each first family are great - and we found ourselves enjoying the Coolidges most of all.  Ed Flanders was truly funny as a Not So Silent Cal.  And it was odd seeing Leslie Neilsen is such a serious roll (as Ike Hoover, the chief usher).

We enjoyed this DVD.  It's particularly wonderful to have around in the winter when there's not much on television.  Makes you wish that the networks were still in the business of producing such good and interesting programming.",1136678400,7,1039,4.628415300546448
2398343,5,B000AYELAQ,I too like many of you am so thankful that this mini-series has finally been released on video after all these years.  I got to know Lillian Parks personally shortly after the mini-series came out and visited with her a number of times prior to her death at the age of 100.  She was a fascinating person and a very friendly person as well.  She shared with me some of her personal experiences at the White House and allowed me to video tape her discuss her experiences at her home one time.  Up to her death she lived on the second floor apartment of a two story home on the outskirts of DC.  Up the steep stairs up to her floor were many autographed photographs of the presidents and first ladies as well as some paintings that Eisenhower painted as well.  She also had a number of miniature donkeys that were President Roosevelt's and other items given to her by the presidents and first ladies.  I will cherish my memories of this fascinating woman and have now been able to let my son watch what I enjoyed watching about 26 years ago.  Buy this DVD and become part of a fascinating time in our history.  Watch and enjoy!,1134777600,7,1124,4.365384615384615

Traces the history of the domestic staff along with the presidents and their families from William Howard Taft to the inaguration of the Kennedy White House.

Each of the four colorful discs is enclosed in a separate holder and all are enclosed in a box with a pamphlet of information. The discs are in much better shape than I thought they would be and would rate the quality a 4 out of 5 and quantity a 5 out of 5. Good but not as good as Eleanor and Franklin: The Early Years - better color and in letterbox! The set is worth the price and will provide hours of enjoyment.",1131235200,34,737,4.302158273381295

You get a feel for the difficulties for both servants and presidential families. The characters are very appealing.
However, many of the scenes of all of the servants eating together could not have happened. During Maggies's work years, black and white servants ate in separate rooms, according to the book Private Residence by Kate Brower. Why didn't the producers check the facts with Lilian Parks?
The program was great but the employers were almost too nice. I would like to read the book by Lilian Parks now to get the real story.",1513209600,,713,4.712
