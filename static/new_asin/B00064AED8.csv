8038538,4,B00064AED8,"Lo Mejor de Salsa en Grande, I don't think so, however and even though I never heard of some of the Salsas I was surprised and thought they were Good! Not that many Hits Here! The Video Quality is Good, not the Best, The sound is Loud and Clear the way it comes through my Big Speakers just the way I like it, sometimes it goes up and down depends on the Music Video but is not that Drastic, most of them are from the 90's and All the Music lasts about 97 Minutes

I gave it 4 stars for some of those reasons, to me a 5 star DVD are the Following: Clasicos en Vivo Adolescent's Orquesta, Sonora Carruseles Heavy Salsa & Sweet Boogaloo, Fruko y Sus Tesos El Padrino De La Salsa, I wish I could give them more than 5 stars. Salsa En Grande Vol. 1 Has No Talking Interruptions between Songs which is good, and there is a Bonus Track where Gilberto Santa Rosa Talks his Head Off and it's OK, he is in the Proper Place for That!

The Sound Volume in the Bonus Track is very Low and the Video Images Pretty Bad, many different Old Video Clips and Gilberto Santa Rosa makes many comments per each Clip Shown, I found the Bonus Track not that interesting to me, although you can't beat that Low Price for the DVD!
Salsa En Grande Vol. 1 has A lot of Great Salsa Music and I am Glad I got it, I am considering getting  Lo Mejor de Salsa Vol. 2 if I ever find the List of Titles, for some reason it doesn't give much Information on the Product Page! ...Thank You  D.D.",1348531200,,1458,4.069686411149826
