3894870,4,B002BJGYJO,"When it's time for a child to go to school, I think it is only natural for them to be a bit nervous. And when the characters from a popular series are redesigned, that can lead to some nervousness too. So there's a certain symmetry when it comes to this DVD release.

""Let's Go to School"" is the first Leapfrog DVD to feature a brand-new character design launched in 2009. It's also the first in the series to be released by Lionsgate-- previously the DVDs were released by Sony. So let's get some things out of the way, right away. The characters definitely look different, but they still look quite cute. Overall, the feel of the animation is very nice and it's a lot of fun to watch. The characters' heads seem to be slightly too large for their bodies, but the effect works here. The other main thing to note is that this seems to be a bit of a reboot. Tad and Lily are now the exact same age (in fact, it seems to be suggested that they're twins) and the show staff have apparently chosen to have them forget everything that they learned in the previous DVD releases. They don't seem to know anything more than basic counting or letters.

That said, I think this DVD works on the whole. The story begins with Tad and Lily being nervous about their first day of school. Big brother Leap assures them that it's going to be great, but they're not so sure. Enter Edison. In ""A Tad of Christmas Cheer,"" Edison was a fairy godbug who helped out Tad and Tad only. In this release, both Tad and Lily seem to know Edison quite well. He has a special stone which transports them to a sort of magical school. There, they learn that they're not the only ones nervous about going to school. So are all the books, the chalk and erasers, the calendar and the clock! But together they help each other to all feel less nervous. The film clocks in at about 35 minutes, which seems like a reasonable amount for the target age group. I suppose I somewhat agree that they may be trying to teach a bit too much and too many varied concepts here, but the material is in general presented well. In fact, it's so well presented that I think many kids will want to view the program more than once, which should help to reinforce the material. On the whole, the program is presented pretty straight, but there are some humorous moments involving Edison and also a slightly snarky talking clock.

The film features five songs. The only one that doesn't really seem to work is the film's alphabet song. 26 letters is a lot to present and the tune used isn't very catchy and really starts to drag after a few letters. Otherwise, the songs are fun and have catchy tunes.

Special features:

- Closed-captioned (I know, this may not seem like a special feature. But none of the previous Leapfrog DVD releases have included closed-captioning, so it's nice to see this finally being included.
- Preview of ""Math Adventure to the Moon,"" which comes out in 2010
- Interactive alphabet book
- Trailers for other programming
- Selectable Sing-alongs of all five of the film's songs-- ""Alphabet Song,"" ""Counting Song,"" ""Animal Family Song,"" ""Calendar Song,"" ""Leapfrog Learning Path Song""

This film is not rated, but is listed as being targeted at ages 3-6.",1250726400,26,3223,4.510273972602739
3894871,5,B002BJGYJO,"My son's absolute favorite LeapFrog DVD is the ""Letter Factory"". I have to admitt, that I was excited to see this new DVD ad in Parents Magizine, hoping that ""let's go to school"" would be equally favored, and some honest relief to watch a diffrent DVD for a change.  :)
I gave this new DVD 5 stars because it is great!  I wish it had been released a year ago when my daughter was starting Kindergarten.
Let's go to School"" really grasps the nervousness and uncertainty that children face as they begin school.  I apprecaite how relatable both Tad & Lily are with their own fears about school at the begining and with help, end the DVD being confident. (great lesson to apply to your children who are equally uncertain and nervous).

In this DVD the classroom enviornment is exciting and fun, which in turn helped me to explain how fun learning can be, and is!
The songs are very catchy, and the two that my children have memorized, (after only watchig the DVD two times) enforce numbers,(counting to 20) and a song teaching the days of the week and the months of the year (great concept).

Even though this DVD is over 30 minutes long, the story takes you on a journey that seems only minutes.  I highly recomennd this DVD, esspecially if you have a child starting a new grade, or a new school.
I know that this will be given as gifts from my family to many friends this next year.",1250726400,2,1381,4.417322834645669
3894872,1,B002BJGYJO,"We bought this for our daughter because she is about to enter kindergarten, and because the other leap frog videos we have purchased were awesome. This one however, is just ridiculous. The content and the animation have really gone down hill. There is no character continuity between this video and the rest. The First 5 have Tad learning his alphabet and numbers with Lilly and Leap (his older siblings) helping him. Then in this one he magically forgot everything he's learned at the Letter Factory. Plus Lily is no longer his older sister, but is now his twin. This one just seems really dumbed down compared to the others.",1250726400,7,626,4.752293577981652
3894873,5,B002BJGYJO,"We got this DVD the day it was released! We are big fans of all the LeapFrog DVDs and really looked forward to this one as our youngest has had a lot of anxiety about starting school this year. The DVD immediately put her (and the entire family!) at ease. She related to Tad and Lily and their nervousness about starting school and by the time the movie was over, she was so excited to start school! What was even more amazing was how my older daughter (who is starting her second year) was also glued to the story. Besides putting children at ease with the start of school, there are some great lessons packed in here that will be relevant throughout the entire year as they learn about The Alphabet, Counting, Animals, Time, etc. Another great LeapFrog DVD that doesn't dissapoint!",1250726400,4,783,4.52112676056338
3894874,3,B002BJGYJO,"I am a huge fan of many Leap Frog products because kids love them and as an educator, I really appreciate how well they reinforce given skills.  My absolute favorite DVD for teaching phonics skills is the Leap Frog Letter Factory DVD.  So, when Let's Go to School came in the mail I opened it right away and let me kiddos, ages 3 and 6 watch it.  Tad is back and ready for another learning adventure.  This time Tad and Lilly are going to school for the first day.  Leap makes Tad and Lilly a little nervous about the first day. Soon they find out that school is pretty cool & everyone gets nervous sometimes.  As they tour their classroom they learn many things when typical classroom items come to life and teach them.  Basically, this DVD has a little of everything, ABC, numbers to 20, animal classification, more an less...  It is definitely cute and the songs are catchy.  It kept my kiddos attention.  They enjoyed the catchy songs.  I am giving it three stars because I was not impressed with the teaching value of the video.  It seems to try to cover too many concepts in a short amount of time.  I love the other Leap Frog DVD's because they focus on one skill.  Fun to watch, but learning is little.",1250726400,20,1210,4.367713004484305
3894875,1,B002BJGYJO,"We very much enjoyed the first four Leap Frog DVDs, but this one is terrible.  I'd say invest in the first two, Letter Factory and Math Factory.  They are much better done.",1250726400,4,172,4.34375
3894876,5,B002BJGYJO,"I taught pre-school for 19 years at Praiseland Pre-school.  Our school was lucky enough to be one of the first groups to watch this movie.  It is very entertaining for young children.  ""Let's Go to School"" held the interest of the children (ages 2 -5) and they were able to interact with the movie while learning shapes, letters and numbers.",1250640000,4,341,4.65
3894897,4,B002BJGYJO,this dvd is not the same as the others. Tad and Lilly are not the same they look and sound different. It is also a different format.

So, this was a good way to give them an idea of what might be in a school.  Of course, nothing in their classroom is going to sing and talk to them, but seeing some of the things that they are going to learn about was good for conversation.

I even like it and find myself singing some of the songs on the dvd because they are cute and catchy. I did not have any problems with the sound being low like I read in another review. I do agree with the other reviews about Tad and Lilly being the same age in the dvd when they weren't in previous dvd's, but they never mention them being twins so I don't know where those reviewers got that from. I think the dvd was meant to help kids be comfortable with starting school and learning some basic things (days of the week, seasons, months, numbers, etc). and not to be technical about Tad & Lilly's story. Great learning dvd, and although it covers several subjects in a short amount of time, I would recommend this for toddler's/young children.",1406505600,2,846,4.327044025157233

3894949,3,B002BJGYJO,"Okay, so my kids have all loved the Letter Factory and the World Factory and the 2nd Letter Factory (now called Code Word, or something). Those were excellent, 5-star videos. With their help, all my children learned their letter names and sound before they were 2 years old. My complaints about this one and the other newer ones are as follows:

1. Suddenly Tad's older sister Lilly is now his twin. Huh?
2. This Tad's voice is terrible.
3. The previews go on and on and on and on and on. They didn't have any previews in the first Leapfrog videos I bought and these previews make it really hard to get to the main movie in the car where my daughter watches these. It is sooo annoying to me that I'm tempted to give it only one star. Really.

The plus. My daughter doesn't care that Tad's voice is annoying or that Lilly's age suddenly changed. She enjoys the songs. These reinforce the first Leapfrog videos but are definitely NOT a replacement. Buy those first. I'm glad I got this for her, but I put in the others more.",1401062400,,1022,4.373684210526315

3894977,5,B002BJGYJO,"This Leapfrog DVD introduces a wide array of concepts, from counting to 20, ""more and less"" concepts, animal families, days of the week/months of the year, to letter sounds and shapes.  If you are just new to the leapfrog DVD's, I highly recommend starting with this one (or a 3-pack that includes this one and the letter & word Factory ones).  My child learned SO much through this ""movie,"" as she calls it.  I feel that this one is even more packed with educational stuff than some of the other Leapfrog DVDs, because the entire plot is about learning things in preparation for school, so not much time is wasted in a sub-plot.

As for the negative reviews, I'm not sure what's wrong with introducing a vast array of concepts.  I think the concepts here are well-chosen, as most of the topics are ""sequencing.""  What I mean is, they are all things your child will have to memorize in order at some point anyway.  Counting, Alphabet, Days of the Week, Months of the Year, etc.  Learning these topics in this format is extremely helpful with the songs.

And I personally liked the ""story format"" of this DVD better than the ones at the factory with Professor Quigley (which, by the way only constitutes for a small portion of the many Leapfrog DVDs).  We will all like/dislike different things.  This does not detract from the educational value in any way, and I personally think it's silly to make a big deal about it.  The purpose of these DVDs is to TEACH, not entertain (though they accomplish both phenomenally).  We love the ""learning path"" song at the beginning of this DVD, which is also in many of the other DVDs, like Math Adventures to the Moon, and Numbers A'hoy.  I think the ""Factory"" ones might have been made first, so maybe that's why people have a hard time with this one, and the others like it.",1351382400,,1814,4.558641975308642

This time they get to go to school all by themselves and learn about all the objects in the classroom. They meet the singing and talking calendar and the clock thats kind of like an old man. They play with the blocks, who talk and grow big and small. They stack up like a staircase all the way up till they hit the clouds. The little frogs follow the steps singing and laughing. They play with other things, the little animals. They are plastic but they turn real and make the whole experience fun. I think that if characters were like this you would begin to feel very safe. Thats what happened for the little frogs, school wasn't even going to be scary because they had made friends with all it constitutes. I love climbing up into the sky to find the clouds, who knows maybe you would find Mary Poppins. It was happy. The other one was underwater this one was skybound.",1348358400,,1008,4.367021276595745

These are their favorite shows and watch them all the time. They hradly want to watch anything else. We bought another program (your baby can read) but both girls lost interest very quickly.

The first time I showed him this one, he told me to turn it off because they were doing the letters wrong (his words, not mine).  I think he had gotten used to Letter Factory, and did not like the difference.  He now likes this DVD.  He especially likes one part where Tad is playing with and counting blocks.  My only caution is that Tad is shown juggling the blocks at one point, and my son had tried to imitate him.  I admit that I really don't appreciate a DVD that encourages a toddler to throw blocks.  The DVD covers a lot of different topics without going into a lot of detail on any of them.  The main goal of the DVD is to show a kid what school is like.  One thing that I find a bit strange, is that they never show a teacher in the classroom.  The mention a teacher once or twice in passing, but the teacher is not present in the DVD at all.  It seems to me like telling kids about their new teacher is a big part of preparing a kid for school, so I wonder why that leave that out.",1300147200,,1087,3.9403669724770642

In addition to the unnecessary change in the birth order, the singing in this video is absolutely horrible - Off key, hard to hear, and just plain bad.  The content is decent with numbers and days of the week presented but it is difficult for anyone to hear and difficult for an adult to watch, unlike the Sony produced videos which were enjoyable for adults as well as children. I could have sung better than these characters . . . which is not saying much.  Additionally, all the characters sound like their noses are clogged. The whole sound track is unpleasant.  I am giving it two stars only because the content is decent and my daughter did not walk out of the room while the video was playing.",1298246400,,807,4.5
3894992,3,B002BJGYJO,"Let me start by saying that the other leap frog videos are awesome! This one, however, is not.

I like the animation, but it isn't consistant with the rest of the videos and if you're child is used to the other ones they might not like the change.  My daughter seemed unphased.

In the first letter factory, you have Leap, Lily and Tad going from Oldest to Youngest, respectively.  That theme continues while Tad learns is alphabet, phonics, numbers, counting, etc with his older brother and sister helping him.  NOW Tad is  Lily's twin! What?  and he doesn't know anything?  Huh?  I would thing consistency helps in learning.

My 2year old loves this video.  It's entertaining and I do like the animation. BUT its not a typical leapfrog educational video that I'm used to. It's their earlier edition If you want more learning, I would go to the more specific videos like: Letter Factory, Math Circus, etc. Those videos stick more.  My daughter knew her letter phonics within 2 weeks of randomly watching Leapfrog's Letter Factory.

But this video has a little of everything and is entertaining.  I can see with repetitive viewing why this could be educational, but isn't worth as much as their other video series.  It's too much.  The alphabet is 26 letters and the pretty much whip through it.  The same goes with lots of other subjects and their songs.

AND I'm not a fan of the songs.  the calendar song reminds me of a song in Wicked, the musical, with the months as lyrics.  Its annoying- and I liked Wicked.

This is pretty much a cartoon.  Glad I didn't buy it.

He also has a leapfrog explorer (which he LOVES) and i'm sure that has alot to do with why he still wants to watch it!  It's very informative, and I was surprised how many special features it has.

I mean the old series there were many characters, in this one there are only 3 full sized characters (Leap hardly counts though) and multiple small characters that are more subjects or guides to what is going on and don't really play any significant role. I enjoyed the interactions of the older series betweeen characters. This dvd is more skit based. Like the difference between a drama show and saturday night live. We follow a less interesting and not as bright Tad through various areas mostly inside a classroom. There are observations going on but hardly any teaching. They rattle off the ABC's much too fast, and the whole things moves too fast. I was much less satisfied at the end of this dvd than I was with the older series. My daugter seemed to like it but Lily's role change is a bit confusing and I think we both missed the old cast of characters. When a formula works why change it?

It doesn't matter how old you are...it seems there is always a bit of trepidation when starting a brand new school year and the characters in LeapFrog Let's Go to School...felt the same way.

We already own all of the other Leap Frog movies and they have been favorites for years (Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory, Talking Words Factory II: Code Word Capers, Learn To Read at The Storybook Factory, Math Circus, and A Tad of Christmas Cheer). I cannot say eneough good things about those movies.

I guess I had wrongly assumed that this new movie would be like the ""next"" in the Leap Frog movie series--which it absolutely is not.

It's like whoever made this movie had never seen any of the other Leap Frog movies before. Suddenly, big sister Lily is now the same age as little brother Tad? Suddenly, Lily AND Tad have forgotten everything they knew from the previous movies and have to learn the alphabet all over again? Not even that they have forgotten, the movie actually implies they have never learned anything ever before! This is just not alright!

This movie is no more educational than Barney or Dragon Tales. In fact, this movie DID remind me a lot of Dragon Tales. Just horrible. It was not put together well at all, and really was a disapointment when compared with the previous Leap Frog videos.

My child immediately noted that the letters were not the same colors as in the other movies, and they did not have their classic characters that they have always had (the letter K used to wear a karate uniform and kick, the letter L used to lick a lollipop, etc.) Leap Frog omitting this from their new movie is just another disappointment.

My child was also very much looking forward to seeing the ""Quidgits"" again in this new movie (remember them from Math Circus), however what looks like quidgits on the back cover is actually a stack of blocks, not the quidgits.

I recommend buying all other Leap Frog Videos except this one, because it really just doesn't fit with the previous movies in the series.",1250899200,10,1934,4.656891495601173
