I have almost every Scandanavian detective series and they were all outstanding
except for Vares. I would not watch any part of this if it appeared on TV.",1381708800,,355,8.128205128205128
8563133,5,B00B62ER1O,This is a wonderful character. I would love to see more of Vares and his whole crew at the bookstore and bar. His relationship with the police is very believable and it shows the problems that they have to deal with. Vares is a character to himself and I would like to see more intricate plots especially ones that involve unsolved crimes from years earlier. This would allow him to have more interaction with his book shop friends. I love seeing the country side and the stories of how small areas think of crime and outsiders. More Vares Please.,1379116800,,547,4.5353535353535355
8563134,5,B00B62ER1O,I enjoyed watching every exciting episode and the acting is superb. The stories are complicated and kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat. Fascinating storylines.,1370649600,,168,5.035714285714286
8563135,5,B00B62ER1O,'Gambling chip' (second in this series) is a tour de force. The first series was wild enough. These are almost OTT. But they are not. Antti Reini (Vares in the TV series) never drops all the strings. Any pretense of a linear story line is abandoned in this second set. I seem to remember a time when there were guys like Jussi in the US. I repeat the 'adults only' warning from my review of the first series (teeny boppers will be bored to tears anyway).,1370217600,,454,4.290697674418604
8563136,5,B00B62ER1O,This is one of the best mystery series around.  It captures the magic of Finland while having the ambiance of Mike Hammer.,1368921600,2,122,4.545454545454546
8563137,2,B00B62ER1O,"it was totally boring from the start
each episode got worse
to be honest it was a waste of money\
same goes for the 1st three episodes",1367625600,2,134,4.0
