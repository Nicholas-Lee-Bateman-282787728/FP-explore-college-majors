189307,5,1572522828,"An Adult, not rated, film

This is the second film in a ""trilogy"" (like Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was a Trilogy; i.e. more books and more films followed the trilogy) that stars Sylvia Kristel as Emmanuelle and spawned a large number of copy-cats (most of which go by the name Emanuelle).  This particular film is based on Emmanuelle Arsan's book ""L'antivierge.""  This film has been alternately titled ""Emmanuelle 2,"" ""Emmanuelle L'Antivierge,"" and the US trailer says that this film is titled ""Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman.""

The second film starts with an older longer-haired Emmanuelle setting sail on a passenger ship in the group sleeping quarters.  While lying in the cot that the ship has provided, Emmanuelle starts talking with one of the many women sleeping nearby (some of these woman seem to prefer sleeping barely clothed; some in hammocks, some in cots).  The blonde mentions how she can't sleep with all these other women nearby as she was attacked at school by some women.  Emmanuelle ""comforts"" her with some of the other women looking on.

When Emmanuelle arrives at her new Asian home, she finds an unexpected guest, a male pilot.  After finding that pilot, wife and husband try to make up for being apart for 2 months but husband has an appointment.  After the meeting, the husband and wife are able to make up for lost time.

Emmanuelle goes out on the town shopping with the pilot, and ends up receiving an acupuncture massage in front of the pilot.  While receiving the massage, Emmanuelle nude massage, she fantasizes about her husband, while the pilot looks on with disgust.

There are numerous interesting scenes, besides the ones already mentioned, including: Emmanuelle visits a dance study and spots a machine with an erotic/bondage picture show inside (hand-drawn), and while watching is visited by the dance instructor;  Emmanuelle, her husband, and a young blonde friend visit a special massage parlor where all the customers are messaged by women, who start off using their hands, but who quickly use their naked bodies against their naked clients, front and back (a very interesting massage parlor (actually it is a place where people are cleaned using soap and asian women); Emmanuelle visits a nightclub filled with naked (some dressed or semi-dressed) women, and men having fun (most of the women are asian and most of the men are in uniforms); then their is the scene where Emmanuelle and her husband have fun with the blonde woman (Anna Marie) from the parlor.

Emmanuelle is less naive in this film and takes pleasure everywhere she can find it.

Interesting music choice, I kept expecting to see that guy from the Incredible Hulk TV show to turn up, similar sounding music.  (4.45)",1114732800,20,2726,4.956043956043956
189308,4,1572522828,"If you are a sex loving couple looking for some ""lustful voyerism"" before pounding each other silly...but you don't want the usual XXX (boring) porn...this may be a film for you.

It has all of the magic of the other, successful, mid-1970's Euro erotica films...the music is haunting and stays with you long after your last orgasim has been completed.  I particularly enjoyed the theme of ""a middle-aged couple"" befriending a young, naive, 18 year old French girl.... and for what else? To de-flower her and then have 3-way sex with her while on vacation with her in Bali!

This film has serious female ""bi-sexuality"" in it....it portrays a theme I believe most middle aged women, in their hearts, truly desire.  You get to see Emmanuelle passionately kissing and making love to a variety of men and women....all done very tastfully and erotically.  As opposed to showing two totally naked people, baring their obscene ""shaven"" genitals and finally ""spooing"" all over each others faces.

I'd forgotten how many young women had beautiful pubic hair on their genitals, back in the 1970's...until you see this film...perhaps you had forgotten too.  I recommend this film for ""horny middle aged couples"" whose wives are secretly ""bi-sexual beasts"" ready to drip all over the couch, while they watch beautiful French women masterbating or getting a nude bubble bath from many stunning, petite, Chinese bathhouse [...].

The only thing keeping me from rating this film 5 stars is the rather weak story line....and the toned down sexuality between the stars.  If you want a little more sexual tension and realistic ""S&M style"" floggings, in your old Euro-porn films...try ""The Story of O"" or even better, ""The Image""...Those are two 5 star recommendations.",1105574400,6,1749,5.066202090592334
189309,5,1572522828,"If we had to pick the best erotic film ever (and we're glad we don't), this would be it!  This film violates many of the conventions that hold back other erotic films.  Rather than unbelieveably beautiful bodies and impossibly vigorous action, this film features erotic tension between several believable, attractive characters.  What's more, it has one of the most important characteristics of any movie -- it ends at just the right time.  (Interestingly, the same could be said of the film's subject!)  If the bath scene doesn't stick with you for years after viewing this film (as it has for us), please check your pulse.  Be sure to listen to the original, French soundtrack, because in addition to being the language of love, many of the voices of the actors add immeasurably to the eroticism of this film (particularly the young girl, Catherine Rivet).",1105056000,4,858,4.923611111111111
189310,4,1572522828,"The best of the original trilogy, I think. Those are the ones where Sylvia Kristel starred (i.e., had more than a moment on screen), and vastly better than the tripe that followed in the Emmanuelle name.

This is a warmly sensuous film. This might even be the one to use for introducing a shy viewer to movies about physical happiness. Emmanuelle is fully her own woman - every scene lies well within her consent and enjoyment. A new character, Anna Maria, is a sweet, innocent young thing. Emmanuelle, of course, broaches that innocence in an elegantly filmed sequence of encounters. A few scenes, like the infamous ""Jade Club"", come across as crude, but only when meant to. Still, they don't seem threatening. That's another aspect of this film that I like better than the first.

It's too much to say that this movie has a plot, but it does have a story line of sorts. The movie is really just about happy eroticism, though, the kind that relies more on your imagination than on actual imagery. It's sort of like a musical where I come out humming the tunes even if I can't remember the words. Couples might like this movie, even bashful couples, and might like playing along with the actors on screen.

189311,3,1572522828,"There are several running times for this film according to the IMDb, but one thing I noticed about this DVD is that the transfer could have been done in the PAL European standard, which makes the film run faster by 4%, hence the shorter running time.  The UK DVD, which is censored by about 30 seconds runs 87 minutes, this Fox Lorber version is short of 86 minutes by less than 10 seconds.  The 2.35:1 transfer on the US disc looks soft and the film has its share of scratches, colors are mildly faded as well, certainly not an ideal presentation, but still a good deal at this price, especially since the title is already out of print.  These early Emmanuelle films will be reissued by another video company in 2003 as part of their ""Emmanuelle Collection"".",1043280000,4,759,4.525547445255475

At least is much better than the sequels that go after.",1022371200,5,249,4.208333333333333
189313,4,1572522828,"There is something about Kristel, this genre, this era, that I must have a lack of good judgement.  Perhaps I can blame it on my adolescence.  My utopian sex life would mirror these cheesy videos.  Kristel is beatiful, her lovers are too.  The soft core sex scenes definitely work for me.  This video makes for a great escape from the realities of sexual freedom.  There are no jealousies, ugly consequences or ugly people.  --  Again, I think that I could be a bit more critical if this movie were made with another actress.  I have a soft spot for Kristel in my cynical view of soft porn.  All of her Emmanuelle films are fun to watch.",1012694400,10,637,4.413793103448276
189314,4,1572522828,"Strange...I have the full 92 minute version (with French Subtitles) and it is made by Fox Lorber.  Anyway, that is the movie I will review...
Sylvia Kristel knows what female sexuality is.  She does not have a fantastic body  and her face looks typically Dutch, but she has this mystical look that  most women nowaday have no clue about (Catherine Deneuve has this same  look).  She plays the now experienced Emmanuelle (from the first movie),  who now has a new husband and lives in Hong Kong.
There is little plot,  and the movie is based on a series of vignette sexual encounters, but the  European soundtrack and exotic locations are so sexual.  If there is a  movie to put anyone in the mood, without being obvious, this is it.  I feel  that it is better than the first one, which was very seventies, raunchy and  had artsy dialogue.
The DVD is still pretty bare, but the transfer is  very good (absolutely neccessary for such a visual movie).  Sound is  average, but hell, I read much of the dialogue anyway (I absolutely love  the emmanuelle song).
So, you want to a little raunch in your collection,  skip Pamela Anderson and all those fake blondes and try this erotic gem  that will show you the true meaning of sexiness......Rating: B",964915200,64,1244,4.6192660550458715

189330,5,1572522828,"A wonderful sensual film with a most outstanding soundtrack. Sylvia Kristel brings to life another episode of the insatiable Emmanuel. Ms. Kristel not only brings decorum to the role, but also class and a beautiful sensuality that only this beautiful woman can exude. The artistry, cinematography and detail for art direction makes this film a beautiful cinematic crescent of colors to watch. The erotic scenes were so beautifully stages, shot and endured, that you cannot help but to want to be with the actors playing the scenes out with them as well. I recommend this film cause it will not only transport you back to a time where erotic films had a definite story structure and cinematic beauty, but they were also artful and decadent. The nostalgia is palpitable. I cannot comment enough on the soundtrack of this film. The orchestration are guttwrenching and emotional and adds light to every scenes where it is placed.

189345,3,1572522828,"So this is not what I thought it would be, for 2 reasons: one) I must have missed that this particular DVD version only has French in the spoken version, with Spanish subtitles! While this does not bother me, since I master both, it did, however, not help my husband, who only speaks American English, lol.  Second, if you saw the original Emmanuelle, you might find that this E-2 lacks the freshness of the story line E-1 is displaying. As with many 2nds and 3rds, etc..., the story line suffers and becomes ""flat"" or repetitive, and in this case, both. There is not much interaction on the level of the couple, as in the E-1, they meet, have some sex, and go their merry ways with separate adventures. Also, the husband is not the same actor this time (Umberto Orsini) as in 1. While in the first one, it is all about the definition of the ""erotic education"" of Emmanuelle, in this one, she is just going from one little adventure to the next. And frankly, one wonders what should be the specific reason for these haphazardly encounters. Eroticism: yes, some  -  but the spirit of the ""Emmanuelle"" line of eroticism, not so much! But, on the up-side: the story stays within the realm of what is referred to as ""soft porn"" in this country: no explicit shots.",1353024000,2,1259,4.5131578947368425

A gorgeous cast of women and men headlined by Sylvia Kristel, this was by far the finest movie in the entire Emmanuelle series. Francis Lai's beautifully seductive and haunting score throughout, adds to the rich photography and passion laced scenes. I've always said let me personally experience the massage parlor scene before I die. That scene features the beautiful Laura Gemser who went on the play ""Black Emmanuelle"" in a later series. This movie never fails to romantically stir both myself and my female companion who is watching at the time. I have given this as a gift on 6 separate occasions to good friends.

189351,3,1572522828,"Okay, first of all I will start by saying that the director of this film took a totally different direction with the film compared to Just Jaeckin's 1974 Emmanuelle.  On my first viewing I found this film very hard to follow being as there were many inconsistencies in accordance with the first film in which only six months has elapsed in the timeline of the movie.

This time around, Emmanuelle is travelling to Hong Kong to visit her husband(not played by the original Daniel Sarky, but by Umberto Orsini), who instead of being a French diplomat as he was in the first film is now oddly an engineer/artist... Is he the same Jean character or did she coincidently marry another French man named Jean?  Not that the first Emmanuelle film was big on its plot, the sequel's plot seemed to be more scarce and focusing on the sex scenes, which pop up more randomly than the first,of course that's a big plus if you're really a fan of that kind of stuff. The scenes are often described as being 'sensual', but I just figured that the director was taking more risks by making the sex scenes a tad bit more raw and a bit sleazy(of course today's soft core is more sleazy). For instance, when Emmanuelle has fun with the blonde she meets on the boat...not nearly as sensual as the scenes with Bee in the first film. Not that I really understood why she joined the mile high club with two men in the first film, I was really baffled as to why she chose the injured polo player as her quest, or the dance instructor...or the three sailors??? She definitely enjoys her 'freedom' more in this one.

While I found the plot a but hard to follow, Emmanuelle 2:L'Antiverge has a great score offered by Francis Lai(Love Story).  The opening theme is great, not a French classic as the 'Emmanuelle' song had become but still amazing.  There are many scenes within the movie where the soundtrack is beautiful such the acupuncture scene, the dance studio scene, and lastly the infamous bath house scene.

I'm not sure if I have the completely uncut version of this film, but I do have scenes of the movie others have complained are missing from their versions. The version I have does indeed include the dance studio's interesting porn-toon peep show clip as well the bath house scene, which lasts well over three minutes so it couldn't possibly be cut. Btw, I have the 92min version, Fench dialogue/English subtitled.",1246320000,,2399,4.617370892018779

This is a more polished movie then the first Emmanuelle, with all those involved, gaining from previous experience. It is a very stylishly elegant and restlessly erotic film in the series that changed sexy cinema forever. One of the most delectable pleasures include the famous bathhouse masseuse sequence (featuring the legendary Laura Gemser)and Emmanuelle's daring seduction of a friend's shy young daughter into the delights of a menage-a-trois!

so i bought the 2012 dvd thinking and hopeing it's the Unrated version which goes bit longer than 90mins
it has more scenes of explicit sex with Sylvia kristel
i know for a fact the old Anchor bay dvd is the Unrated version with a small retrospect featurette on the film
this Anchor bay dvd is hard to get now and out of print
the 2012 listing on amazon has the same cover art as the Anchor bay dvd so i thought Great it must be the Unrated version
there is no product details to say if it's Lionsgate dvd so i took a risk and bought it for $20 of amazon listing
man was i Disgusted when i got the dvd, the Lionsgate logo is on back cover but it's Definitely not the Unrated version
i played the Disc and the film is an exact copy of the 1998 Fox Lorber version which is the edited version
plus there's no extras, just the production notes, Sylvia kristel BIO & Theatrical trailer
again there's no product details to give you any info on this 2012 dvd & amazon does not have listing for the Anchor bay dvd
which tells me they're not selling it anyway, you'll have to try get a copy of Ebay that's the only option
