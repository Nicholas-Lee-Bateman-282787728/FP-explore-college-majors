8127395,5,B000FVW9OE,"Watching this film can be unsettling, not really because of what it shows but because of how it shows it. The camera is our point of view and Jancso has the camera in constant, restless motion. After seeing this film for the first time, I felt like I had been on a roller coaster ride. Like Hitchcock's Rope, the film is shot with very few cuts; the camera just moves from one subject to the next. Even when the characters are perfectly still, the camera continues to move about them. But the people are mostly in motion, peasants walking around, back and forth as they speak; soldiers milling around and confronting them; aristocratic riders on horseback circling around the perimeter, hemming them in and blocking our view of the background and their paths of escape. Like many films made under a communist regime, this one has no single hero we can follow; instead the protagonist is a group of peasants, often holding hands and embracing in solidarity. What characters say is often hard to make sense of, especially with this DVD translation; but I originally saw this film in a theater with a decent translation and I still couldn't make sense of what was being said. I just don't think that's important. Jancso is a master choreographer and this film has so much to say just with its ""body language"" that I never get tired of seeing it.",1394928000,,1342,4.642857142857143
8127396,3,B000FVW9OE,"This DVD was apparently produced in Korea.  As far as I can figure, the Hungarian was translated into Korean and than the Korean subtitles were translated into English and for the most part make little sense.  The visuals are wonderful; the ability to follow what is happening through dialogue, not so much.",1372291200,3,307,4.884615384615385
8127397,4,B000FVW9OE,"This is a 1971 Hungarian colour film about the revolt of agrarian peasants and land workers against being dispossessed of their land. Miklos Jansco's Red Psalm is an allegory based on the choreography and movement of large groups of people. It's like a cross between Von Trier's Dogville and the American musical Oklahoma,utilizing music almost continuously,saturated with music and songs from Hungarian folk music to Russian revolutionary tunes. Both form and content are revolutionary,with Jansco's innovative golden age starting in the 60s with films like The Red and the White,usually in black and white and their great use of long takes. There are the revolutionary working class and the oppressors,but told eschewing traditional grammar of scene and narrative,where the framing device moves with extended tracking shots from distant observation to extreme close-up. The shifting nature of the camera means the characters are essentially moving around with it,giving the film a ballet-like feeling. The storyexpresses the powerless attempting to create space in which they have power. The social issues are transmitted by the movement of the characters within the choreography. The great chorus of the oppressed chant against an inhuman and immutable order,the dumb soldiers stripped of significance,the passing horsemen have neither function nor goal. The female nudity represents freedom and equality,a nod to the liberation of 1968.

The seed planted now will only be revealed to grandchildren,the river flowing with oppressed blood will go on to irrigate the revolution. This is a hymn to official socialism and revolutionary traditions. An attempt to return to a grassroots sense of faith rooted in the earth,a communal identity,a form of paganised Christianity,away from a corrupt power-serving church. People break into dance and song when they feel like it,the revolt is perpetually under threat from the vested interests of the ruling classes. The men's dances, their arms around each other's shoulders, supplies a visual motif denoting brotherhood, solidarity and the importance of banding together. The violence is moralistic,ideological,the righting of an ancient wrong,its achieving perfect justice. Impressive individual set-pieces throughout, but perhaps most spectacular is the large-scale massacre towards the end, shot from a single camera position in the far distance, with soldiers and peasants singing and dancing together in apparent unison before the soldiers regroup into a circle around the peasants, trapping them in a human stockade. If the didactic material is not to your liking give the film a chance as a harbinger of the future in Eastern Europe and for the sheer virtuosity in which it ploughs a new furrow in the modern story of film.",1320192000,2,2773,5.524705882352941
8127398,5,B000FVW9OE,"Cinema is often idealized as the unitary coherence of the artforms that proceeded it. It's in this spirit that Raymond Durgnat spoke of the ""photo-tography and choreo-calligraphy"" of Miklos Jancso's Red Psalm, a 1971 Hungarian socialist musical about a 19th century peasant revolution. Composed of 28 lengthy shots, the film is 87 minutes long. The camera dances (tracking, panning, tilting and zooming) around a large cast always in motion singing, dancing, monologuing, conversing, uniting and dividing either into an amorphous mass or sharpening down to a single individual. A tele-photo lens flattens background and foreground elements. The story is as like to be advanced by dialogue as by a gesture, an article of clothing, a color, the movement of a girl roaming around a hesitant body of armed men or the clash of two opposed musical cues. The characters remain largely unnamed but we are allowed to provide our own. The film's theme is revolution.

The characters stand for ideas. The Idealist, the Materialist, the Militant, the Pacifist, the Poet. Their interactions with each other and with the representatives of the major institutional forces of history are dialectical. There is no right and wrong. There is only conflict and growth. Early on the socio-economics of this world-stage are presented to us in the form of a letter from Frederich Engels. The development of Hungarian capitalism is bringing forth new industries while undermining peasant agriculture creating sharper class divisions between large landowners, struggling peasants and newly landless proletariat. This capitalist revolution ""means indescribable suffering for the majority of the people but it alone creates the conditions which ensure a new social system"" along with ""men and women who will have the strength and desire for the materialization of a new, better social order."" This tragic Marxist world-view is later reinforced by a landlord who tells the peasants that the iron law of supply-and-demand will not be overthrown even if they were to own the land they now fight for. While the letter from Engels sympathetically urges the revolutionaries to have faith in the future (it seems improbable they fully understand the letter's contents) the landlord attempts to co-opt the revolution into liberal avenues of promised reform. When his attempt at co-option is rejected he magically drops dead.

This is a classic and unforgettable film that should be better known. It rewards many viewings. With the exception of Carl Theodor Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" no film has moved me and challenged me to the same degree. Unfortunately, this film in not available in Region 1. This Clavis Film version, though, is well worth the effort of getting.",1291852800,3,2744,5.262557077625571
8127399,3,B000FVW9OE,"Miklos Jancso was one of the most important Hungarian directors of the communist period, and used the traveling dolly shot more skillfully than any other film maker. His ideas about movement and drama contributed a great deal to the film landscape. His films are highly didactic, filled with undeveloped characters acting out rituals which express his loathing for war. His films are often rituals of massacre--one side killing enemies, then the other side killing enemies. THE RED AND THE WHITE is a fine example. RED PSALM comes very late in the cannon, and is his first color film. It's a rare bird indeed. The film moves very much like a piece of music--theme is stated then returned to with variations. Peasants gather to resist their oppressors and the crowds and oppressors keep growing in size. The whole affair reflects a national celebration--music and dance infiltrate every scene while a constant litany of communist agitprop fills the soundtrack. What's unusual is its ""flower child"" sensibility--nude girls with flowered crowns, dancing youth, a uniformly beautiful cast. Fire is another visual theme that grows in the film to include a burning church that must have influenced UNDERGROUND. It becomes an extravagant expression of visual poetry which Communist film making encouraged. (I AM CUBA) Nothing in American film looks anything like this film and if you're into visual style, this will amaze you. You'll also need patience.",1230595200,3,1446,5.210300429184549
