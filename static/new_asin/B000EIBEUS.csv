8110473,5,B000EIBEUS,"I loved the inspector so much in this film I wouldn't mind a sequel. This is a film for history buffs and Mystery lovers alike. Blood Rain is set on a paper rich province in 19th century Korea. During a festival a ship loaded with paper cargo is burned down, and a detective is sent in to investigate the circumstances behind the arson.
Immediately upon his arrival on the island the investigator becomes entangled in a series of gruesome murders. The owner of the paper plant was accused of being Catholic and killed, along with his family 7 years prior, and now people are falling victim in the same fashion the family was killed.
The protagonist of this story is an investigator named Lee. He is a Korean Sherlock Holmes, working on simple deduction, and at times violence. He doesn't suffer superstitions lightly, and is especially irritated with the local Shaman.
Lee is played by Seung Won Cha, who is nothing short of brilliant in this role. He is stoic, a man with pride that comes with rank and genealogy. Because of his own morals and pressure from his senior officer, he is determined to find the killer.
The only thing that kind of puts me off is the level of violence. There are only a few violent scenes, but the few that are there are a bit graphic. There is one scene where someone was drawn and quartered that I had to look away. But I have a low tolerance for violence, so I'm really not a good judge.
All in all, Blood Rain has the best of everything. Beautiful costumes, good production, intriguing mystery, the right amount of action and wonderful acting.
I don't think there are enough adjectives for this movie. Highly recommended!",1182729600,,1654,4.591216216216216

Visually, theyve surpassed the U.S. in terms of color and composition, and in the case of Blood Rain, in terms of plot and pacing as well. In the Chosun Dynasty, a ship loaded with fine paper as a tribute to the ruler burns in port. An investigator is sent to the remote island where this occurred to investigate.  He encounters a series of brutal murders and a deep secret which he has to unravel before the island disolves into chaos. Like many Korean films, there's no lack of violence and intensity. Good acting and a terriffic plot, with first-rate production values make this one to watch.",1176076800,,636,4.578947368421052
