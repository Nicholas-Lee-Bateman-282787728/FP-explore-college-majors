7841952,2,6303205682,"I was deeply disappointed with this video. I purchased it to learn about Seville. The video cover reads ""Museum City Videos: Seville, Jewel of Andalusia: A Tour of the city seen through the eyes of its artists, architects and poets."" This is NOT what the purchaser receives! The video does have the usual lovely, even breathtaking shots of Seville, accompanied over 90% by the most annoying background music you've ever heard. This is not a documentary. There is a narrator who comes in very very occasionally and has a vague word to say. But this is not an educational video by any stretch of the imagination. You see numerous pictures without ANY explanation of what you are viewing AT ALL. The average American high school Western Civ student gets more than this from her textbook.",1028851200,4,784,4.814814814814815
