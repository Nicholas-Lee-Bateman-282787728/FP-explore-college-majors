There was a building subplot brewing between the two lead characters and a possible romance. I have not heard or read a good reason they canceled the show!!! I get so pissed when I binge watch the 16 episodes and realize there are no more!!!  If you can find it, buy it!!!",1503100800,2,438,4.0813953488372094

8574019,5,B00BUELL2Q,"I bought the set recently, thinking was all region but it isn't so I bought an Orei player and it is playing right now and I would urge other Harry Mc Graw fans to buy this DVD package. It played on my desk top as well.",1389916800,2,219,3.782608695652174
8574020,5,B00BUELL2Q,"Why is this an Aussie-only release?! This is a delightful show, a late 80's spinoff from ""Murder, She Wrote,"" about a well-mannered Boston lawyer, Ellie McGinnis (Barbara Babcock) and her lovable slob investigator, Harry McGraw (Jerry Orbach). The characters played beautifully against each other. It was light in tone, with excellent writing. We have some of these episodes on VHS, taped off TV years ago, but the quality has degraded over the years. Please put this out on DVD for American viewers to rediscover!",1364774400,10,514,5.130952380952381
