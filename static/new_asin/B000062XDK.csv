These are the only DVD's that I have ever had to return for reasons of very poor quality.  Stay away.",1023148800,16,350,4.242424242424242
1684445,1,B000062XDK,"Not only is the quality of the Peter Gunn episodes recently released by A&E substandard (it is more reminiscent of Madacy Video), the episodes are CUT, despite what it says on the box.
I was checking The Chinese Hangman for quality against the Rhino/Image laserdisc and noticed that some lines in one scene were missing, as follows.
[Cult leader Ahben Unesku is talking to Gunn about finding Joanna Lund, who absconded with money from his organization. The missing lines are in square brackets.]
Unesku: The funds were in safe keeping. Joanna and I were the only persons who had access to them.
Gunn: When did she disappear?
Unesku: Last week. [I held hope that perhaps she would return to us. I sought forgiveness for her in meditation. By her act she has desecrated the sacred duty. She's shattered the very tenets of the philosophy.]
Gunn: How long have you known Joanna?
Unesku: She came to us almost five years ago.
Gunn: Any relatives?
Unesku: Not to my knowledge.
Gunn: What about friends?
Unesku: WE were her friends.
Gunn: In other words, you want me to find a girl that could be anywhere. It's a large world, Mr. Unesku
[Unesku: Would you accept a thousand dollars?
Gunn: If I find Joanna and return her to you with the stolen funds...
Unesku: I would be greatly in your debt.
Gunn: There's no need for you getting in debt, Mr. Unesku, I'm sure we could settle on a figure right now.]
Unesku: (takes money from his sleeve) Shall we say a thousand dollars now and an additional two thousand when you find Joanna and the money?",1018742400,69,1535,4.626373626373627
1684446,3,B000062XDK,"Blake Edward's ""Peter Gunn"" is a tough character.  The private investigator is a big man, quick to use his fists, and used to carrying a gun.  A smoker and drinker, his HQ is a bar called ""Mothers"" run by a woman called ""Mother"" (big surprise!).  The singer in the bar, Edie Hart (Lola Albright) is Gunn's girlfriend.  Every private eye has a buddy on the local police force, Pete's is Lt. Jacoby (Herchel Benardi).  The two-disc set contains 16 half-hour episodes arranged in broadcast order.
A half-hour TV detective drama is a challenging proposition.  Almost all of the screen time must be devoted to plot development, with little time for wasted scenes.  A concern was that the writers would take the easy way out, and resolve stories in some convenient fashion just because of time constraints.  Having characters pull out guns, and shoot their way to a solution could be a tempting way to wrap up an episode running long.  And truthfully, it does happen here more than a few times.  There are however, some quality episodes in this collection.
Gunn does his share of investigating, but perhaps because of the time-limited format, it often seems that trouble seeks him out, thus speeding up crime solving process.  Gunn is like a lightning rod for trouble, drawing hoods, heavies and damsels in distress.  When trouble appears, it usually means a fight, and Gunn both gives and takes his share of lumps.  The level of violence in these episodes is very high, and they are not suitable for young children.  Gunfights, strangulation, shotgun blasts, explosions, hangings, arson, car bombings, and plain old cold-blooded murder, is what you will find here.
Peter Gunn is not about solving mysteries, with the audience following along, sorting out false leads, and attempting to guess the guilty party.  There isn't time for that.  Instead each episode usually opens with a murder or crime, and then it's more or less a straight line from there to the culprit.  There isn't a long list of suspects to choose from.  In the best of these episodes, there is still suspense generated in this rigid format.
Craig Stevens as Peter Gunn, comes off as stiff and rather wooden, with a delivery reminiscent of a sedate Cary Grant.  A gruff, low-key individual, that is somewhat hard to warm up to.  Herschel Bernardi as Lt. Jacoby is deadpan, speaking with a dull monotone, at times he hardly seems alive.  His conversations with Gunn do not make for the most animated TV viewing.  Peter's relationship with girlfriend Edie is firmly established, but he has little time for her.  And though we follow with some interest what happens to these characters, it may be a stretch to say that we actually ""like"" them.
These black and white episodes are from 1958, and the picture quality reflects that age.  Common flaws are streaks and dirt, lack of sharpness, missing frames and a ""wavey"" image.  The quality of the episodes varies, but seems to improve as you get to the later ones in the set.  Comparing the image quality of Peter Gunn to ""The Rifleman"", a program from the same time period also recently available on DVD, the transfer of ""The Rifleman"" is far superior.  The images are sharp, texture is more visible, and dirty and missing frames are not evident.  Based on A&E's high standards, the quality of the original Peter Gunn episodes must not have been very good to begin with, and they did the best job they could.  While the video quality isn't the best, the audio track is clear, and sounds just fine.  If you happen to own Henry Mancini's Peter Gunn TV soundtrack, you may recognize a track or two from the snippets of music played on the program.
Vocal numbers by Edie Hart are also frequently featured.
In summary, Peter Gunn provides a look into TV's violent past.  The set is a good value, providing nearly seven hours of hard boiled, two-fisted programming.  The programs at roughly 25 minutes in length, make for quick convenient viewing.  If you like a tough no frills approach, Peter Gunn is your man.",1018396800,30,4013,4.786337209302325
1684447,1,B000062XDK,"Shame on A&E for using the syndicated masters on the series.  In many cases hissy, 16mm prints with scratches in them.  To make matters worse, the episodes are cut 22 minute syndicated versions.  Another BIG disappointment.  The packaging should have been the tip off here...COLOR pictures do exist from the series BUT so-so black and white shots used for the covers.

1684453,4,B000062XDK,"What is here is good. But I was disapointed that there are episodes missing that are not on Set 1 of Set 2. They just happen to be some of my favorite episodes. Like the one where right after the scene where Peter has received a close shave in a barber shop, the next scene is a lady singing ""Too Close For Comfort"". Also the one featuring a female singer who fakes her own death to escape a man trying to kill her. She is a great singer. I bought the Set 1 and Set 2 mostly for the music.",1299715200,3,489,3.9

I told him that were it not for the shear thrill of seeing Craig Stevens and hearing Henry Mancini in the original settings, I'd never believe that Stevens or Mancicni who gave their all, would accept such poor historical versions of what was, next to Mr. Lucky, the best of their genre.

I hope to live long enough to see someone digitally clean these up and restore the original dialogues.",1296259200,5,463,4.383720930232558
1684455,4,B000062XDK,"OKAY! FINE! SWELL! I DIDN'T DISCOVER PETER GUNN UNTIL ABOUT 1974. BUT I CLEARLY REMEMBER MORE EPISODES THAN WHAT WERE OFFERED IN THE 2 VOLUMES THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED. I LIKED THIS SHOW. HOWEVER, LIKE SO MANY OTHER SHOWS WE KEEP GETTING JUST A HAND FULL OF EPISODES.

WERE ARE THE REST?! THIS WAS SUCH A COOL SHOW. UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT STARTED. WAS THERE A MOVIE THAT BEGAN THE SERIES. IN THE LATE 80'S THERE WAS A PETER GUNN MADE-FOR-TV FILM. I KNOW THAT PETER GUNN HAD A GIRLFRIEND WHO WAS A SINGER IN A LOUNGE/BAR. I KNOW THAT HE WAS CLOSE FRIENDS WITH LIEUTENANT JACOBI. I KNOW THAT HE HUNG OUT WHERE HE GIRLFRIEND WORKED. MOST OF ALL HE WAS A REALLY COOL DETECTIVE.

NOW ABOUT THE QUALITY. I AGREE, THE QUALITY COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER. SOME OF THEM JUST LOOK LIKE SOMEONE SIMPLY TRANSFERRED THEM FROM FILM ONTO DISC WITHOUT DETAILS TO APPEARANCE.

SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!

ALL IN ALL WHOEVER HAS THE RIGHTS TO THIS SHOW, PLEASE RELEASE THE REST OF THE EPISODES. I DON'T RECALL ANYTHING FURTHER BEING AVAILABLE SINCE 2004. CRAIG STEVENS, THE STAR, PASSED AWAY IN 2000. HE WAS ONE OF THOSE STARS THAT HOLLYWOOD JUST SORT OF OVERLOOKED. I'M SURE HIS TALENT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USED.",1262908800,5,1228,4.493273542600897
1684456,5,B000062XDK,"For those who enjoy film noirs from the 1940s and 1950s, should enjoy this set of Peter Gunn TV episodes.  Here, the setting is the late `50s with the jazz, poetry and beatnik scenes and the ultra-cool ""Gunn"" and his beautiful girl ""Eadie.""

Sometimes I think just catching a short scene here and there with Lola Albright (""Eadie"") is worth the price of the set alone, but Craig Stevens as private eye Peter Gunn is always good, too, and the stories are generally interesting.  I mean, the guy hangs out at a bar called ""Mother's"" and has a girlfriend who has the facial looks maybe even surpass Marilyn Monroe.....so it's all very cool.  Yet, she's the one pining over him.

""Pete"" takes on tough cases, gets beaten up frequently but always survives, of course.  This set consists of 16 of Season One's 38 episodes, so you do not get a lot of bang-for-your-buck, but what you do get is an exceptional ""classic"" TV series that still looks and sounds great.",1262131200,3,956,4.594117647058823
1684457,5,B000062XDK,"I don't remember seeing this on t.v. when it originally came out, but I do remember the theme song being all over the radio.  So I thought I'd take a chance and buy it.  It is so cool!  As in ""jazzy"" and ""hep"", with a film noir quality.  There is a great jazz group that plays in most every episode, in the club that Gunn hangs out in.  It is easy to watch because it has a relaxed, laid back attitude to it.  Craig Stevens, the actor who plays Gunn, is suave and easy on the eyes.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good black and white mystery, that is unlike any other in its time.",1236211200,5,595,3.9495798319327733

As for the quality of transfer - I consider myself lucky that these shows have even been saved in a way that allows for reproduction in the first place.  Being much younger than these shows-I'm actually thrilled with the quality-I found no problems that affected the viewing.  I'd rather they looked the gritty way they did way back when than look like a show made in B/W today.  It's authentic, and it's a really great show.",1235520000,8,580,4.433962264150943
1684459,5,B000062XDK,"I only vaguely remember seeing Peter Gunn as a child.  My parents probably didn't let me watch it because of the bar scene, violence, etc., which is tame by today's standards.  Over the years and everytime I would hear the Henry Mancini theme song, I would think about buying the series and watching it.  Finally did and WOW!  Great detective series!  If you are at all nostalgic, this will take you back.  Subsequently bought Vol II and I am looking forward to seeing them all.",1231372800,3,478,4.564705882352941
1684460,5,B000062XDK,"Look up ""cool"" in the dictionary and you might get a picture of ""Peter Gunn.""  This show started a wave of private eye/detective shows in the late 50's, ""77 Sunset Strip,"" ""Johnny Staccato,"" ""Mike Hammer,""  ""M Squad,"" and many others.  Craig Stevens starred as ""Peter Gunn,"" sort of a lesser Cary Grant -- but solid nonetheless.  Lola Albright was a real dish as his squeeze.  Throw in Emmy winner Herchel Bernardi as his Lt. pal, Hope Emerson as the 6'2 ""Mother,"" and last, but surely not least, Henry Mancini's jazzy score and you have a real winner.  The show ran first on NBC, then ABC, for a total of three season.  The discs are a bit pricey, but you'll get some terrific retro stuff.  The picture quality of the 50-year-old prints are not pristine (as you might imagine) but the sound quality is first-class.  Highly recommended viewing for a chilly, rainy evening.",1187827200,8,872,4.684210526315789
1684461,5,B000062XDK,"Long before Crockett and Tubbs, before Magnum and Dan Tanna, and before Tony Franciosa as Matt Helm or Mike Conners as Mannix, there was Peter Gunn. He was cool. He was the guy every girl wanted and every guy wanted to be like. He lived in a cool world of jazz and bad guys, and girls who needed his help. He had a cool and sexy girlfriend, a little on the sweet side. Some of his friends, like Lt. Jacoby, were squares. It somehow made Gunn even cooler, that you didn't have to be cool yourself to be his pal.

Craig Stevens was Peter Gunn and Lola Albright was his girl, Edie Hart. Hershel Bernardi was his cop pal Lt. Jocoby. Hope Emerson was ""Mother."" She ran the jazz joint Gunn frequented. Blake Edwards was the guy who dreamed up Peter Gunn in the first place. By accident, he ran into a guy by the name of Mancini while getting his hair cut, and the music Mancini would write for Gunn would change television forever. It would also begin a long and fruitful friendship that would give moviegoers and music lovers such classics as ""Days of Wine and Roses"" and ""The Pink Panther.""

While there is an occasional washed out look to these black and white episodes, the convenience of having so many great episodes on the two discs sort of makes up for the occasional lack of quality. Volume one contains great episodes like ""Rough Buck"" and ""Streetcar Jones,"" while the second disc contains fabulous entries such as ""Death House Testament."" My favorite ""Peter Gunn"" episode of all time, ""Lynn's Blues,"" is included on the first disc.

This is one of the best episodes of Peter Gunn ever aired. Linda Lawson portrays Lynn Martell, singing hauntingly about being blue. It is obvious she needs someone on her side. Lynn is an old friend of Peter Gunn's girlfriend, Edie, and Gunn noses around the jazz club where she sings as a favor to her. He soon learns that Edie was right to be worried.

A knife-wielding guy named Santano (David Tomack) guards Lynn and doesn't take well to Gunn asking questions. Gunn's old pal, Lt. Jacoby, warns him about Santano, who works for the club's owner, Nat Kruger ( Guy Prescott). Peter suspects it all ties in to the murder of Roger Dwyer (William Masters). Gunn is just in the nick of time to keep Lynn from ending it all, and she finally tells him her story of love and sadness.

Linda Lawson gives a great performance as the distraught Lynn Martell, and sings beautifully, adding a lot of atmosphere to this episode. Gunn gets to flirt with his girl Edie and talk to ""Mother."" Lt. Jacoby will have Gunn's back when everything comes to a head, and the last scene of Gunn and Edie dining at the club and listening to Lynn's final number makes this one really special.

This particular episode was written by Lewis Reed and the show's creator, Blake Edwards. Like all the others, it had Mancini's West Coast jazz score. Craig Stevens will always have a special place in TV history as the very cool, Peter Gunn. This show broke new ground in television for its blend of music and action, and set a tone for what cool really was. This is a must have for ""Peter Gunn"" fans and anyone else who loves classic television. There may indeed not be much that's new here, but that is only because Craig Stevens as Peter Gunn started it all.",1158105600,16,3266,4.499156829679595
1684462,5,B000062XDK,"Great entertainment from the fifties.  Peter Gunn was the cool detective of his day.  From the great opening theme to the fine cast of supporting and guest characters, this show is an institution from the golden days of television.  In watching these episodes, it is hard to believe that they only run thirty minutes each rather than the hour long dramas we have become accustom to.  Drop into Mother's for a nightcap, some cool jazz and good tv.",1155427200,7,446,4.67948717948718
1684463,3,B000062XDK,"I was hoping this was going to be a lot cooler than it was.  PETER GUNN has a solid reputation, the redoubtable Blake Edwards behind it as creator and, of course, Henry Mancini's justly famous, driving theme song.  In this series set you get two disks covering the first 16 half-hour episodes of the show.

 Anyway, here's what I learned from the first seven-hours (series set number two is in transit, but the mold was cast by episode two, and I don't think it's gonna change much.)  PETER GUNN stars actor Craig Stevens in the title role.  At certain angles Stevens is a dead ringer for Cary Grant, a fact not lost on the show's producers.  Gunn is suave, cool, unflappable, and well dressed in the latest of late-`50's fashions.  Each episode, which lasts about 25-minutes without commercials, begins with a crime or a scene of violence happening to someone we've never seen before.  A girl falls through a swank nightclub skyline to her death, for instance.  Opening credits and theme roll and Peter Gunn is soon drawn into the case.  Gunn can usually be found at Mother's, a smoky jazz joint on the right side of the river run by `Mother,' played by the imposingly tall (6'2"") Hope Emerson.  Pretty Edie Hart (Lola Albright) is the lead singer at the club and, not surprisingly, Gunn's girlfriend.  Rounding out the continuing cast is Herschel Bernardi as police Lieutenant Jacoby.  For those who keep track of such things, Gunn has a cordial, respectful, and mutually supportive relationship with Jacoby.

 The episodes may start with a bang, but there's an awful lot of whimper that follows.  The crimes aren't terribly imaginative, the guest stars sturdy but unspectacular (the names I recognized from disks 1 & 2 include Gavin MacLeod, Whit Bissell, J. Pat O'Malley, Billy Barty, Ross Martin and - for old music fans - Nino Temple plays the girlfriend of a young hood in disk two's ""Sisters of the Friendless,"") and, although a time or two the light'll grow harsh and the shadows grow long and fat, for the most part the stories aren't all that visually appealing, either.  A lot of dingy back alleys and under-furnished rooms, mainly.

 The show did make me laugh once, unexpectedly.  Poor Lola Albright's Edie is left without much to do besides look beautiful - which she does uncommonly well - breath a tune every half-dozen episodes or so, and worry, wait, and be elegantly wooed by Cary Grant-clone Stevens.  Some of my favorite scenes involve the two of them, leaning over a railing in the back of Mother's, nuzzling.  In the episode entitled ""The Frog"" Whit Bissell plays a character named Daniel Swink (a debonair crime boss from `the other side of the river.')  Another character's name is Vernon Lilly, yet another is simply called The Frog.  When Gunn tells Jacoby and Edie he has to go see Loretta Gymps Edie exclaims `Gymps!  What is it with these names!?'  If PETER GUNN had spent more time gently poking fun at itself, in particular, and crime thrillers, in general, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.  There's a beatnik bar Gunn visits in a couple of episodes that was fun, too, as was a rockabilly bar.  Beatniks and rock-a-billers lost their edge a long, long time ago, but they were `out there' back then, and they add a nice sense of time to the program.  Too bad there isn't more of that here.",1154217600,12,3333,4.696551724137931

The storyline of each half-hour-slotted epidode is tight and to the point, but time is still taken to explore the relationahip between Gunn and his glib, glamourous girlfriend Edie, his matron-with-moxie chum Mother, and the dogged, job-bound Lt. Jacoby.  The series has a timeless ambience.  It oozes with hot, on-the-surface sexuality without being brazenly explicit, and the violence is palpably throbbing without being gratuitous or gorey.

Why can't she just stay in the car or home?

Peter spends a lot of time hanging around Mom's place ""Mothers"" where he gets mysterious phone calls from the soon to be dead. We listen to quasi jazz tunes for the most part.
