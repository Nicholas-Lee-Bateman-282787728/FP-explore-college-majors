8209208,5,B000TGQPY0,"I purchased copies of this DVD a couple weeks ago (from another source) as I recently had some very intense personalized instruction on Burmese boxing. My instructor (saya) had to leave the area for work, so I wanted to have some additional material to use as reference.
Saturday (March 14, 2009), my saya called me to let me know he received the DVD, but he was also very excited to let me know this:

My saya's instructor and school was the one filmed during the segment that shows the movements!

I was stunned. He then told me about the filming, all the people involved, etc. as he was there, but off camera. What is also stunning is he has never seen the original and had been wanting to get a copy of what was filmed for decades.
Anyone care to figure the probability on this? I'm still in shock.",1237075200,2,802,4.375838926174497
8209209,3,B000TGQPY0,"Great documentary on Burmese boxing. Very informative, but I'm not sure why the sound quality on it is quite low. It's well filmed, and edited and narrated. Very real and true to the country, but the poor sound still bothers me.",1204502400,,228,4.585365853658536
