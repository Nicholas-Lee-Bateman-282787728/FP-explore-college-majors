8639493,5,B00I5UXAC2,"Kimi ni Todoke (From Me to You) is one of the best romantic comedies out there. Sawako (the main female character)adorable for her kindness and honesty, despite the fact that she has always been feared and looked down upon by her fellow students, who believe that she can see spirits, place curses on people, and that being near her brings bad luck. It's wonderful to see how she grows after she meets Kazehaya, the first person to treat her like a normal person. Anyone who likes romcoms should watch this series!",1360800000,,514,4.65934065934066
8639494,5,B00I5UXAC2,"Out of allot of Anime I have watched this has to be within the top 20. But the reason it ranks so high out of all of the other more sentimental anime's is because it it does everything it sets out to without taking forever but dos not happen in one or two episodes like other anime it almost completely perfect. Also just to frank every frame looks like it was panted so that's really nice.

NOTE.I didn't like the opening for the 2nd season as much.",1344816000,,513,4.446808510638298
