8318874,4,B001LNOMRM,"""Night Train to Milan"" (1962) is an Italian movie about a Nazi war criminal discovered by an old victim on a train to Milan which leads to attempted murder and a shootout and the train continuing with the Nazi holding a beautiful woman hostage.  The acting is very good with Yvonne Furneaux and Andrea Checchi in the cast and especially Jack Palance as the Nazi war criminal trying to escape recognition and then upon discovery showing very good cause for his service in the German military to be held accountable for being a doctor in a concentration camp and his experimenting on victims.  His final moments are some of his most memorable in his career.  Directed by Marcello Baldi and written by him and Elio Bartolini with music by Carlo Rustichelli, the movie also scored highly for its editing by Mario Serandrei. The movie had quite an original premise for 1962 and the plot has been served up in different ways several times later and the end result is pretty entertaining and effective.  In black-and-white.  Sinister Cinema's original source material is blotchy and has much damage, but, as with all of their product, is watchable.",1344988800,3,1141,4.8307692307692305
