2768713,5,B000NHHDZA,"This is another good set from Timeless Video. This set is from the group of U.S. videos taken in Europe and Pacific which were classified and released recently with the Freedom of Information Act. They are complete with maps and commentary, and will be video not seen before. They will show some U.S. defeats the military didn't want the public to see. The time period is from roughly late 43 through the 1st half of 44. Restricted, the companion set from Timeless Video, is the last half of 44 and the 1st of 45. The video is mostly crystal clear. Some of it is a little dark.",1200614400,21,577,4.401869158878505

8177669,5,B000NHHDZA,"The combat footage is terrrific, there is nothing to compare to the actual films.  It is interesting how these different actions are presented together, it's the view from both sides of the picture.  I particularly enjoyed the aerial sequnces, as the air actions were key to the overall struggle .  JRV",1366243200,,302,4.882352941176471
8177670,5,B000NHHDZA,"If YOUR interested in seeing any of the actual World War 2 films, buy this one. I hae bought several of the World Wa 2 film footage taken during that period. Must SEE",1358899200,,166,4.0606060606060606
8177671,5,B000NHHDZA,Not a bad choice.  This is video files of Bombing raids.  Some gun camera footage too.  Perfect take a nap video.  It's got the same narrator as old cartoons.  Watch and see.,1281398400,,174,4.3125
8177672,3,B000NHHDZA,Very interesting battlefield films of World War II.  A WW II Buff will enjoy this DVD.  I found it very interesting and in many ways informative of what our military went through.,1268611200,,179,4.5625
8177673,3,B000NHHDZA,"I was most interested in seeing AND hearing the DVD about WWII, however, as with the other DVD in the set I commented on, the audio is simply non-existent in this DVD.  I had my volume maxed out and still could not hear the dialog for the hissing and low quality.

The video is okay, but hte sound makes it not worth the money unfortunately.",1262563200,4,341,4.230769230769231
8177674,2,B000NHHDZA,"While Timeless Media Group usually recycles old documentary footage and passes it off as a ""documentary"" accompanied with bland narration, this set is slighty better because it is what is--US Government films not intended for the general public, but produced for the commanding generals and their immediate staff.  Originally considered ""too sensitive"" for general viewing, these declassified films offer an interesting glimpse into the unseen WWII.  Some segments, like ""School for Jungle Life"" is an instructional film for GI's fighting in the Pacific Theater while ""RAF Sinks Tirpitz"" offers some interesting footage on the demise of the German battleship in Norway.  Most of this footage is overlooked by the better documentaries on WWII, but for those amateur historians who like to collect everything possible on WWII now available on disc, will undoubtedly find this footage interesting and affordable. Don't bother paying the Amazon price listed here; these sets can be found at Rite-Aid or Ross Dress for Less for considerably less.",1229040000,5,1041,5.453416149068323
8177675,3,B000NHHDZA,"Forget the ""confidential"" rubric and just relish this assortment of short films. You won't find any secret Operation Market Gardens here, just a quick succession of bombing raids, dogfights, POWs -- even an offbeat segment about a master sergeant who came up with several clever time-saving innovations for which he won the Legion of Merit. The quality varies considerably, but well worth the price.",1228780800,14,399,5.25
8177676,1,B000NHHDZA,"I enjoy good documentaries, especially WWII films. This double ed. gives lots of old footage but little commentary. Segments were not presented in order, just one film clip after the other. It could have been improved a lot with at least a chronological setting and a basic narration. Anyone want to buy my copies?
