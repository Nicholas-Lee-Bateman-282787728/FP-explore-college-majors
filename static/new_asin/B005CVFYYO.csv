8465924,4,B005CVFYYO,This set provided me with great insight into the Mayan way of thinking and how it's not necessarily all about the end of days so to speak. The shift in consciousness is my concern and this explored that aspect in depth.,1368921600,,219,4.365853658536586
8465925,5,B005CVFYYO,I think even post 2012 this still has some very usual information and is still relevant.  Obviously we didn't have it as figured out as we thought we did and this dvd set provides some clues and conjecture,1368835200,,205,4.394736842105263
8465926,5,B005CVFYYO,"I will be ready for the end of days. Will you? Whether the Mayans were dead on with their date, I don't know, but I see it coming, that much is clear.",1354492800,,150,3.71875
8465927,3,B005CVFYYO,"I feel that we should all be prepared for the worst, that all signs point to hard times ahead, and that it has been prophesied so. I bought this as research.  But whatever you're doing with your time, this will be worth your while.  Lots of information here--and it introduced to me the possibility that the great change upon us may be a positive change.",1353456000,,354,4.430769230769231
8465928,3,B005CVFYYO,"My theory is the Mayans just got tired of making calendars and moved on to other things, possibly food-related, but you've got to decide that for yourself, and do it quickly, 'cause time's a-wastin'.  This collection of three DVDs begins with 2012 Mayan Prophecy and the Shift of the Ages, which puts a spin on 12/12/12 as a possibly positive event, the beginning of something spectacular, a new age, and not the end of life as we know it.  Cool.  Less fun and the one I'd go ahead and skip, is 2012: An Awakening, interviews of people studying, teaching and writing in the extra-normal realm, who are quick to rush in with theories and conspiracies wherever science fails to explain.  The third DVD is Ancient Code the Movie, which is the science behind what could make a great X-Files type TV series.  According to this, we're ticking time-bombs and the code for our ultimate demise is locked into our DNA, or somewhere.  Interesting.",1339286400,,936,4.711656441717792
8465929,4,B005CVFYYO,"When did we begin to worship celebrities? Are those the false gods the Mayans warned of? Three hours of historical background, expert interviews, and film give perspective to the predicted end of the world in 2012. Compelling stuff.",1338854400,,232,5.131578947368421
