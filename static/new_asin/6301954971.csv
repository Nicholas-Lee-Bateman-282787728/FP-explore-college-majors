7817368,3,6301954971,"Snakeeater 2, a.k.a. ""Snake Eater 2"" varies wildly from the original Snakeeater movie that allowed Lorenzo Lamas to step out of the giant shadow cast by his father, the late, great Fernando (insert Abba joke here).  Lamas is back as Soldier, with a LAST NAME this time, so now he's called Soldier Kelly.  Seems Soldier is so gosh-darned crazy and in-your face (again) to his wimpy cop bosses (this was filmed in Canada, remember) that he ends up with the choice of either jail-time or an insane asylum for his ways.  CAN'T YOU JUST ACCEPT HIM FOR WHO HE IS???  Anyway, Soldier ends up at the local nut-house, populated by some colorful characters who all just happen to be bad actors.  Horshack from ""Welcome Back..."" makes a return appearance.  Also, there's a Jim Baker televangelist clone in there.  So, Soldier keeps breaking out to do his version of justice: rigging cowardly traps, killing people in cold blood, blowing up bathroom stalls, etc.  AND this time he has a cool, urban sidekick named Speedboat (Larry B. Scott); a dude that looks like he got lost on the way to a Bell, Biv, DeVoe concert and ended up in this movie.  Oh, that Speedboat, what with his witty lines and all.  Anyway, this movie is nowhere near as violent as the first and there's no nudity, so if you are hoping to see Speedboat's hot sister starkers, forget it.  There are two reasons to see this: 1.) the afore-mentioned wheelchair fight on the roof of the nut-house and 2.) the way they kill the drug-runners...OK, and 3.) Speedboat's sister.  That's about it.  Harmless and somewhat fun drivel; great for watching at 3am while loaded.",1090022400,5,1620,4.702127659574468

""Soldier Kelly's not your ordinary cop. He's a shortfused, high-powered ex-commando who's not above breaking the law to bring a criminal down. Lorenzo Lamas returns as Soldier Kelly, the SnakeEater, back to battle a deadly ring of drug kingpins who are killing young kids with poisoned drugs!""
By the way, if you're looking for plot development, there is none.  They give only marginally decent explanations as to how they know the locations of where the drug lord lives, where the crackhouses are, etc. We never find out why Speedboat is called Speedboat... and we're always left wondering how it is that the two main protagonists end up shirtless in a room, muscles glistening as beads of sweat emphasize the labour they're putting into pouring crack into a ventilation shaft for 5 minutes in the movie.
I'm still a little stupified as to the wheelchair duel that takes place on the rooftop of an insane asylum...  And beyond all else, why anyone would want to preserve this film on DVD.
I thought it was hysterically funny in the sense that this is such an awful film.  If you like sitting and making fun of 80's flicks, or if you have a cardboard cut-out of Lorenzo Lamas in your room that you lather in vaseline every day to make yourself feel more like him, then this is the movie for you.",1034467200,3,1321,4.6127659574468085
