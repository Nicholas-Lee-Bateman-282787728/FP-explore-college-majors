8116545,5,B000F2JIRE,"This is an excellent collection of Nanalan' shorts from the series that ran on Nickelodeon in 5-10 minute segments and it really is worth owning the entire collection. If you come to this DVD expecting recordings of the 30 minute program that has more recently aired on CBC you may be dissapointed. This is an earlier version of Nanalan' before it was developed into a full 30 minute program and many things are different.  Most notably Nana is much thinner, has wild red hair and crazy pink framed glasses. There is no Mr. Wooka, no puppet shows and no inside to Nana's house. The story in each episode takes place in Nana's backyard and each episode runs about 5 minutes. The characters of Mona and Russell are mostly the same. The voices are all the same and the sweet and humorous nature of the program is ever-present. However, it does have the program intro and close around every 5 minute short which, after about a dozen shorts gets to be a little tedious. It is interesting to see how Nanalan' has developed over time and this is the chief benefit of this DVD. It may not be something that especially entertains the kids, though, because there isn't much continuity in the collection of shorts and again, each one is broken up by intros and closes. Still, worth buying if you are a fan to be able to have and hold onto a piece of this wonderful little world.  The DVD does say ""As Seen on Nickelodeon,"" but Amazon failed to make this distinction in the posting.  I don't think we should rate the product poorly due to Amazon's omission.",1213401600,2,1545,4.530465949820789
8116546,1,B000F2JIRE,"My kids and I adored the ""orginal version"" aired on CBC. I purchased this not knowing this was remake by Nickelodeon. We were all shocked and saddened at how they changed the look and some of the voices of the original characters. I tried to contact the seller and asked for an exchange rather than a refund being that we opened one DVD. No reply.  Anyone want my set? If anyone can find the ""original"" shows on DVD let me know",1192838400,4,427,4.271604938271605
