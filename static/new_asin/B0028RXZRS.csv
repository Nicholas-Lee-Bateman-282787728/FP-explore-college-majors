The only negative for me, is that it is only 20 minutes long. I can't blame Amazon for that, as the run time is in the description, but I assumed incorrectly that an item being sold as a documentary would be at least an hour. Although this seems like a lot of money for such a short clip, my real disappointment came from the fact that I would have liked the show to be longer. There is plenty of miraculous stuff going on at St. Jude's, and I would have loved to see more.",1313971200,,619,4.12396694214876
8356745,5,B0028RXZRS,"This story starts out like your typical holiday piece, tragedy hits, all is lost, let's look for some good in it.  Not so here, this real life story follows an amazing boy, with the most positive attitude and outlook, through a treatment program so tough that I doubt most adults would have the commitment to complete.  With his mother by his side, he takes each step with the belief that he is one step closer to being finished and moving on with his life.  I don't want to spoil it for you, but you simply have to see this to the end...Daniel and mom Lisa are 2 amazing people who had the blessing of being at St. Jude's where they appear to have given Daniel's life back to him.",1248134400,,681,4.263565891472868
