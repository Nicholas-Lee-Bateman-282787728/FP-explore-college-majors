3883443,5,B002A6JWP6,A very entertaining movie based on the book series created by Robert Arthur. I grew up reading these books and enjoyed them much more than the more drawn out Hardy Boys. I have wondered for years why a movie has not been made on this amazing and very entertaining trio. I am hoping the DVD of Terror Castle will be released for the U.S. Region 1. Try reading the series after watching the movie. I believe you will enjoy them as well. The actors for this movie do great justice to the characters in the books.,1324771200,,509,4.3125
3883444,4,B002A6JWP6,"Fans of the THE THREE INVESTIGATORS books unite! Jupiter Jones, Pete Crenshaw and Bob Andrews come to life in this live action version of The Three Investigators books we all loved as kids.

I'm glad this is finally available in Region 1 so the fans in the United States can see this. The movie gets started right away with a little suspense/action sequence in an elevator shaft. This leads into another scene where the investigators solve a mystery and introduce themselves. The title sequence then rolls and shortly after we're off to Skeleton Island. The story has very little to do with the original Robert Arthur book but I found it to be enjoyable nonetheless. It had some fun ""Indiana Jones"" type action sequences, though I thought the movie could of used some more suspense and a little more action too. There were a couple laughs and some fun *winks* referencing previous books for the fans that I thought were cool. The story was easy to follow and had some nice exotic locations. Though all the child actors didn't quite fit the book descriptions, I thought they did a great job. I loaned this to some friends who had kids under 10 and they were crazy about this movie!  They loved it, even asking to borrow it again!

Overall I found the movie to very enjoyable. If you're a die hard of the books you might find it less so, but if you just have fond memories of the books and haven't read them in a while, I think you'll like this movie and of course if you have kids this is a must buy! There is a 2nd movie that was made based on The Secret of Terror Castle that is even better than this one. When it comes out on DVD early next year be sure to pick that one up as well!

I don't see anything about EXTRAS included on this DVD but if the producers of this DVD are listening, it would be great to get some behind the scenes stuff like deleted scenes, interviews and more!

On another note, be sure to check out my Three Investigators facebook page at [...] and if anyone has any original art from the books for sale, please contact me as I am a collector ... Thanks!",1316563200,5,2079,4.347938144329897
3883445,5,B002A6JWP6,"No idea why this has not been released in Region 1 (USA/Canada) format. And where is The Secret of Terror Castle? I saw BOTH of these movies on the Disney Channel a few months back (and REALLY enjoyed them), so I know they have ""made it to our shore"".

To withhold these movies from DVD release is insanity. And please make more movies before these actors get older and make the series already more unbelieveable than it is already (i.e. Harry Potter). I was hopeful when I saw it on the Disney Channel that they would make it into a weekly series and explore all of the 3I books. That would be absolute heaven and I would gladly re-subscribe to Cable-TV just to get the Disney Channel if that happened.

I guess the real fans of this genre will have to rely on our Aussie buddies to rip a Region 4 and re-encode it in Region-Free for us American blokes.

All the money being lost....such a shame.

-----------------Enough of that...My review-----------------

Although not true to the book, a very entertaining interpretation of a childrens classic series. The Secret of Skeleton Island is told in true Disney fashion; without harsh language or overt sexuality. A movie that the entire family can watch TOGETHER.

Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews, and Pete Crenshaw make the leap from book to silver screen and it's about time! I loved this series as a child in the 1970's and it's theatrical debut is very acceptable and encouraging.",1287360000,3,1429,4.696

The movie cost about $17 million U.S. dollars to make, but I couldn't find out any box office numbers to see how the film did overall. They have made a second film based on Terror Castle but I know that this was a planned trilogy so I'm not sure if production was already under way before the first movie came out or not.

Overall I found the movie very enjoyable. If you're a diehard of the books you might find it less so, but if you just have fond memories of the books and haven't read them or even remember them much, I think you'll like this movie.",1274486400,12,1736,4.409375

3883512,3,B002A6JWP6,"Being a fan of The Three Investigators books since the 1970's, I was excited when I first learned that this German production was available on Region 1 DVD.  The Three Investigators had become extremely popular in Germany, so much so that new Three Investigator books were written and published in Germany.  Known as ""Die Drei"", the series was also adapted for radio dramas.  The original series published by Random House, ran from 1964 through 1987, and produced 43 books.  By comparison, the number of books published in Germany is reportedly upwards of 150!

Why a series about three teenage boys operating from a junkyard in Rocky Beach, California, captured the hearts of those in Germany, may be a mystery, but it is due to that phenomenon that the film The Three Investigators: The Secret of Skeleton Island (2007) came to be.  This movie was followed by a sequel, an adaptation of the detectives' very first adventure, The Secret of Terror Castle, released in Europe in 2009.

In Skeleton Island, the film's producers incorporate some of the basic elements of the Three Investigators' mythology, but little from the original novel.  After an introduction to Jupiter Jones (Chancellor Miller), Pete Crenshaw (Nick Price), and Bob Andrews (Cameron Monaghan), and glimpse inside their secret headquarters in the Jones Salvage yard, the setting shifts to South Africa, as the boys join Pete's father Al (Nigel Whitney), who is building an amusement park on Skeleton Island, for a woman named Miss Wilbur (Fiona Ramsay).

On Skeleton Island they meet Chris (Naima Sebe), a young girl who later hires the boys, after her father Gamba (Akin Omotoso), a native chief who opposes the construction of the park, is arrested for assaulting Miss Wilbur.  Involved in a case that also features an ancient legend, the Three Investigators narrowly escape death while searching for clues.  Back home they would ride bikes for transportation, but here they rely on taxis, and Bill, an associate of Al Crenshaw, who chauffeurs them around.  With Chris joining the boys, they discover that a painting may hold the key to solving an ancient mystery and discovering a lost treasure.  Intended for kids perhaps 8 and above, the movie has instances of superb cinematography, and breathtaking scenery, and is reasonably entertaining, featuring action, adventure, animals, and kids acting independently.  The story is relatively complicated, with does include some adult concepts.

Recognizing that adapting characters over 40 years old, is bound to entail some changes, I'll examine the film from my perspective as a fan.  That said, while a decent adventure, I don't feel that the story really captures the essence of The Three Investigators, or their relationships with each other.  The casting of the boys is kind of marginal.  Chancellor Miller probably comes the closest, as he displays some of the smugness, and flair for the dramatic that Jupiter had, although he doesn't suffer from being slightly overweight.  Pete was the athletic one, and Nick Price kind of assumes that role at times, but the writers don't capture his sense of reserve and cautiousness.  Cameron Monaghan as Bob seems the most miscast, or perhaps more accurately, the movie gets Bob's character completely wrong.  In the books, Bob was much more intelligent and poised, than he is portrayed here, where Bob, is clearly the ""baby"" in the group.  When he spouts information, his pronouncements seem staged, like reciting a speech.  Having all three boys expressing an interest in Chris, and particularly having her sleep over in their room, would never have happened in the original books.

Setting events in a foreign land far from home, gives the writers a free hand, and they take full advantage, jettisoning almost everything associated with the series' mythology.  The Investigators' unique business card, and a peek at their secret headquarters, among the few elements imported from the books.  The most critical element is clearly The Three Investigators themselves, and the movie isn't quite on target in capturing their personalities.  On the good side, technology and gadgets do not figure prominently in the story, the boys are not obnoxious, and though they don't often succeed, at times, the writers do attempt to come up with dialog that reflects the books.

The opening scene in an elevator shaft, and subsequent arrival at an art auction, is nonsensical, reckless, and totally out of character.  Things do improve, but never seem to get completely on the right track.  With not much else of substance to grab on to, the writers turn to the character Victor Hugenay (James Faulkner), the master thief that the boy detectives had repeatedly tangled with in the books.  They do work Hugenay into the story in a clever way, and ramp up the action nicely in the final act, going ""Indiana Jones"", giving the movie a dramatic, big studio type finish.

Some of the issues evaded in the first film, are apparently dealt with in the sequel, The Secret of Terror Castle.  Set in California, this film features Jupiter's Aunt Matilda, and Uncle Titus Jones, highly significant characters in the books, as well as Worthington, the chauffer of a Rolls Royce, who aided the Investigators many times.  Probably not a good thing, but Victor Hugenay returns.  I have yet to see it, but the true measure of the filmmakers' vision of The Three Investigators, should be realized in this second film.  I wonder what role if any, the German books play in the film adaptations.

As entertainment for kids, Skeleton Island is a decent 3.5 star effort.  However as a representation of cherished childhood memory, the movie regretfully does not do The Three Investigators true justice.  Although I do appreciate the attempt, it only rates 2 stars, bringing my overall rating to 3 stars.",1331769600,14,5835,5.070157068062827
3883513,4,B002A6JWP6,"Okay, mock me. As a kid I devoured them Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries. I even had a yen for Trixie Belden. And yet I was always more partial to Robert Arthur's juvenile detective series, Alfred Hitchcock and The Three Investigators. What I liked best about it was that just about every adventure showcased elements of the supernatural. A typical Three Investigators case tends to be - to quote the cautious Pete Crenshaw - ""spooky, dangerous, and impossible."" Of course, near the conclusion of each case, Jupiter Jones would employ his wits and offer up a clever but perfectly mundane explanation for whatever featured unearthly phenomena.

My second favorite bit is that the Master of Suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock, would drop in for a cameo, mostly so that the Three Investigators could regale him with details of their latest solved mystery. At the time, way back then, I only knew Hitchcock from his television show. Reading these books convinced me to try out his feature films. I figured any grown-up cool enough to hang out with the Investigators deserved that consideration.

After decades of being kicked to the curb by the Hardy Boys and even Nancy Drew, in 2007, the Three Investigators were finally adapted to motion picture. THE SECRET OF SKELETON ISLAND is set in contemporary times and yet, even though certain things are tweaked, the story keeps enough faith with the source material. There's an unmistakable whiff of Scooby Doo in the goings-on, but this film recreates that sense of adventure and the sleuthing and that smidge of the occult that so typified the books.

Jupiter Jones (Chancellor Miller) is the brains of the outfit. Pete Crenshaw (Nick Price) is the athletic (but reluctant) go to guy when action is called for. Bob Andrews (Cameron Monaghan) is in charge of Records & Research. These very young private eyes frequently meet in their hidden clubhouse located somewhere in the cluttered junk piles of the Jones Salvage Yard. Okay, certain liberties were taken. THE SECRET OF SKELETON ISLAND does veer away some from the plot of the same titled book (which was first published in 1966). The film opens with the Three Investigators exposing a shocking art forgery and preventing what would have been an audacious art theft. Well deserving of a jaunt, the detecting trio are invited by Pete's dad to go traipsing in South Africa, specifically on the ominous Skeleton Island where Mr. Crenshaw is working on a construction contract. But even on holiday the Three Investigators are never too far from the weirdness.

Skeleton Island is rumored to be cursed, this springing out of a 400-year-old legend. And a strange mythological creature is assaulting the island's inhabitants. It's not too long before the Investigators are in the thick of things, unearthing ancient clues, rescuing a kidnapped girl (Naima Sebe), and in a race against a fabled criminal to locate a long-hidden treasure. It's a real tricky case. But, as ever, Jupiter Jones, that impeccable logician, applies the first rule of the investigator: ""To see what's right in front of you.""

I had a lot of fun watching this film, even though things were tweaked or modernized to commercialize it. For one thing, I don't recall Jupiter, Pete, or Bob ever getting all caught up in a crush over some girl (who, in the book, was a boy). But I'm sure the kid viewers will get a kick out of the Investigators' secret lair and their use of wireless mics and blowguns that dispense itching powder and the fact that the Investigators demonstrate repeatedly that they're smarter than the adults around them. The kid actors all bring something to the table. The really terrific Chancellor Miller is the boss of many moments. Miller effortlessly spits out a heap of big, multisyllabic words. There's even a taut sequence past the halfway point which recalls those Indiana Jones flicks. Hopefully, watching this will inspire kid viewers to look up the original novels. They're in for a real treat. Although, grown-ups may have to explain just who Alfred Hitchcock is (""Mom, what's PSYCHO?"").

Been there, done that, unimaginative copy-cat storyline of evil developer and her cohorts wanting to build a resort on an ancient indigenous population sacred site which they, of course, are not too happy about. Kid detectives have all the exotic tools in their hidden junk yard, (cheaply appropriate) hide-away headquarters from which they conduct, beyond any reasonable expectation, the solving of Indiana Jones type mysteries. For the most part just cheap background, sets and props - a cave, a fake tomb, hidden messages. Just too predictable of an ending which you probably can guess at.",1326672000,,757,5.064
3883515,4,B002A6JWP6,"Having no children, I am not familiar with children's books until they become movies. As an adult, I have found seeing the movie first makes reading the book easier as you already know the characters and plot.

The three investigators are far smarter than any child or adult on the planet. While this is all fun, it is extremely unrealistic. To add to the fun, spy music is played during the introduction. Our trio of bad child actors go with dad to the cursed Skeleton Island off the coast of South Africa where they plan to build an amusement park. The island is also the sacred ancient burial ground for a local tribe, of which one man guards the land. Realistically an amusement park would never get built on a burial ground, especially in South Africa today. This demonstrates that the screen play was poorly adapted from an older book to modern times. They drive modern vehicles, but there is a lack of cell phones.

As a mystery, this is strictly for kids as there are as many suspects as there are in a Scooby-Doo cartoon. The kids are able to make connections that don't exist. The kids do things I wouldn't want a child to do such as sneak around, breaking and entering, and creating disruptions. The movie does have a theme of racial harmony as we have an inter-racial kiss, something I didn't expect. Entertaining for kids, tolerable for adults.

If your child loves Scooby-Doo, they should love this film.",1326585600,2,1418,4.619047619047619
3883516,4,B002A6JWP6,"At first I was expecting this to simply be a little kids movie, but as it went along I was more and more intrigued by the characters and their talent and wit/cleverness.
Chancellor Miller plays Jupiter in an enjoyable story of three boys who love investigating and finding answers to the unanswerable. Jupiter's ingenuity is much greater than anticipated and was actually fun to watch for a person who is used to the best in detective shows and films. The two boys who back him, Pete and Bob, are entertaining and pleasant enough. Pete acts as the cautionary one who is always the first in the safe zone, but last into danger. Bob, whom some may recognize from Music Man with Kristen Chenoweth, plays the brainy sidekick. Oddly enough, he finds all his research through books, which is unusual to modern movie goers because all the slueth films today have the nifty computer gadgets. Supposing though that the movie was coming out around 2007 in Europe and 2008 in the US. Being made therefore before 2008, it can be guessed that this was around the time when computers and cell phones were just beginning to be a big thing (iPhones first came out in 2007).
A fun and enjoyable watch, great for any young slueths out there who want to sit back and take in an investigation!",1324944000,3,1273,4.612334801762114
