My daughter's name is Holly (born in 1989) and my son's name is Christopher (1987) so I was thrilled that I found a movie where the characters had their names.  Anyway, I am happy to find it again!  I put the Bears out every Christmas!",1357948800,,383,4.191780821917808
8176561,5,B0006AZNGA,"This is a Christmas program that came on a few years ago when my daughter was very young. She is going on 19 now, and it is still her favorite of all times even though it doesn't come on anymore, or we haven't seen it in a while. We watched it over the holidays, and she still had the same reaction as she did all those years ago, brought back so many memories. I would recommend it to anyone with small children, i think it will be their best Christmas show also.",1261612800,,464,4.054347826086956

""I remember watching this on CBS back in the mid-90's. It was a really cute tv special; it's a shame they don't air it anymore. Actually, I think they only aired it once.""

They have actually aired it more then once because I used to watch it yearly until Iforgot the name, it is a great holiday special with a tale of experiencing Christmas for the first time.  There is also a great big grizzly bear in it who they must convie to help them and a family of beavers too!  It is a great holiday classic for all ages!",1148083200,,545,4.211538461538462
8176563,5,B0006AZNGA,"I remember watching this on CBS back in the mid-90's. It was a really cute tv special; it's a shame they don't air it anymore. Actually, I think they only aired it once. It tells the story of two kids, a boy and a whose names I don't remember, and their parents who are on their way to visit Grandma for Christmas for the first time. Each child owns a teddy bear; the boy's bear is named Christopher and the girl's is named Holly. When a bad snowstorm hits, they are forced to put their journey on hold and come across an abandoned cabin, conveinently located in the woods. The kids are naturally upset that their Christmas morning at Grandma's won't be happening, and say that this is going to be the worst Christmas ever. The two bears come to life and, with the help of a talking compass whose name I also don't remember, they set out on a mission to cut down a Christmas tree. Of course, being that it is a kids show they are successful in their mission, and the next morning the kids and parents are awestruck at the tree in the cabin's living room.",1132876800,2,1054,4.275
