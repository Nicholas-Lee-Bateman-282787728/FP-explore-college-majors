To make it the right length, they added more boring filler material than any video in history.  They had 4 cameras working, I'm sure they discarded more video than they used, and still we get a couple hours of boredom.  Rent it, buy it with six other people, something, but don't spend the $30 by yourself on it, you'll be mad.",1354320000,,452,4.409638554216867
8456663,5,B0054G732S,very educational & the cap gave it all the viewers. I believe this the best Emb190 you could ever fly with. I really enjoyed it,1329523200,,127,4.12
8456664,4,B0054G732S,"I had looked forward to receiving this video for about two weeks and felt almost satisfied with this ultra professional Just Planes video. It was a pity that the cover of the box presented that this video was ""FILMED IN HD"",but it appeared on my SONY BRAVIA TV only if I used a smaller screen to display. Nevertheless,this is the single disadvantage of this fantastic video.
Captain Jeff Lewis & his first officer really did a great job,getting us on the ground safe
& sound gracefully. I will recommend this video for people who love the EMBRAER 190 very much. Hope that you guys benefit from my reviews and can share your opinion with me.",1325376000,2,640,4.573913043478261
8456665,5,B0054G732S,I always look forward to a new Just Planes video arriving.  The Air Canada video has a good mix of cockpit presentation and video of scenery.  The captain is very interested in flying and gives very good presentations.  One of my top Just Planes videos.,1322006400,,253,4.5777777777777775
