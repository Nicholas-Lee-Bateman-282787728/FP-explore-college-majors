271791,5,6300214559,"The acting is superb and makes you feel that you are part of the action. However you do feel like telling them what to do or say. The story is loosely based on a sixteen-year-old girl Lady Jane Grey (Helena Bonham Garter) on the throne of England for just nine days in 1553, and how everyone tries to manipulate her.

The genealogy behind this can get quite complex but the story is strait forward. Naturally the costumes and scenery add to the movie. If there was any music I did not notice it.

For those who want historical accuracy, go watch a documentary. That does not make this anything less than great entertainment. It has religion for the religious, love fort the loveless, and teaches us to stick our neck out for our principles.

Did I mention that this is an engrossing film?",1499904000,,788,4.496503496503497

I would say it's the screenplay that is too dry at times, but Nunn's direction lacks pacing.  The movie has the steady (and ultimately dull) rhythm of the drum beat that opens the story.

271966,1,6300214559,"Perhaps the actors in this film would even agree -- could have been a special film with on-location shooting and lovely costumes.  As a director, it is clear that the direction in this film is greatly lacking - OR so prescribed that the actors do not feel authentic.  None of the characters seemed to know who they are, to have a 3D history and personality.  The introductions to seeing Cary Elwes' character are awkward and silly.  The best that can be said for this film is probably what Cary Elwes' says in his new movie memoir (As You Wish - excellent audio book!) -- this movie caused him to be discovered as Westley for the Princess Bride.

However much the romance is a vast deviation from historical fact, this movie remains a gem! The acting is unbelievable, the characters unforgettable and best of all...regardless of whether the two two main characters ever even consummated their marriage (they did not), Lady Jane Grey was a fascinating character in what we do have of the historical record (as the grandniece of Henry VIII through his sister Mary).
This film definitely will prod one to investigate the facts themselves and discover the history that is just as sad, yet remarkable, of this extraordinary young women, who goes to her death innocent, yet without the fear of those who used her abominably and ruthlessly to advance their power; and with more true character than the Queen who condemned her.",1415404800,,796,5.083969465648855

I know there are some historical inaccuracies in the movie, but without dramatization, the story would be boring.  The only complaint I have is that some of the liberal views held by the couple seemed too unrealistic.  I don't think young aristocrats of that time would care much for the peasants.  They barely viewed them as human beings.  It's fine to portray the couple as young and innocent, but they were not ideologues..",1395014400,2,521,4.863636363636363
272111,4,6300214559,Very realistic in dialogue and costume for that period. I love ANYTHING related to the tudors. This movie focused on a very obscure queen who only ruled for 9 days. It really lets you see how it feels from lady jane grey's point of view,1394409600,,236,4.266666666666667

The cast does a really good job of defining their roles here and you can tell they understand what their characters want.
Even though it's a little a-historical, and a little boring, I'd still give a light recommendation to people historically interested, with the disclaimer it's a bit of a slog if the romance doesn't interest you. You might cringe. I guess I'd also give an even lighter recommendation to anyone curious about early Helena Bonham Carter? Yeah, sure.",1393027200,,709,4.916666666666667

Helena Bonham Carter was wonderful in her role as Jane Gray.  It unfortunately is not true to history , far from it actually between Jane and Guildford from all  the historical books I have read and historical fiction , that have stuck very close to history. England was a horribly cruel country in those times and I have been stunned by all that I have read including documentaries and the like. Children were treated like chattel and chesspieces on a game board.  More so , the children of the royalty or upper classes if there was something in it for "" the family"" . It disgusts me , and was very difficult to watch , knowing these things actually went on. Four stars instead of five for the liberty the director took with the great 9 day love story.

Despite the fact that some historical liberties were taken, I give this movie 5 stars. Lady Jane's story should be told again and yet again, until finally historians include her where she belongs. Queen Jane of England, murdered by her cousin, Princess Mary Tudor. History reminds us that King Henry VIII chose to pass the cross the crown to Frances Grey, not his daughters. King Edward VI, Henry VIII's only legitimate male heir to the throne, also chose to bypass his half sisters, particularly Princess Mary. So, the most likely candidate was Lady Jane Grey...she was very much aware however, that in being chosen over Mary, or Elizabeth, her very life was in danger.

272134,3,6300214559,"Overall it was a highly compelling and enjoyable historical drama. This was the movie that launched the career of the brilliant and versatile Helena Bonham Carter. Helena was very good on this, as a highly intelligent, and studious girl who brilliantly challenges the dogma of the Catholic Church in her classes with her tutor.
It is dramatically done how she is forced by her cruel and ambitious mother Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk , who Sara Kestelman portrayed perfectly in her ruthlessness and cold determination. The scene where she beats Jane in to submission with whip, while Jane is restricted in stocks is just heartbreaking.

But some of the liberties taken with history from Jane's marriage to Guildford Dudley (Cary Elwes) went just too far for artistic license. The couple never fell in love, Dudley remained selfish, capricious and childish until the end, Jane despised him and never allowed him to us the title of king though he did beg for it.

Furthermore, though Jane may have in her intellectual pursuits have though of bettering social conditions, Jane and Dudley certainly never took any steps as social reformers, even if this can be overlooked as much needed message on the need for social conscience in Britain at a time when Thatcher was waging a war on the British poor (that has never stopped)

I did like the way the ruthlessness of Bloody Mary (Jane Lapotaire) is portrayed and how she agreed to Jane's execution to marry King Philip of Spain, but a lot of this is simply not history",1376697600,2,1516,4.845559845559846

272199,4,6300214559,"This is a pretty good movie about the historical time period after Henry VIII dies. Whether it's historically accurate or not is a whole different question.

Henry VIII broke England away from the Catholic Church. He left 3 important children: Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. Jane, whom this movie is concerned with, is 5th in line to the throne. Edward, as we know, was very sickly, and he is dying. The nobles are concerned that when he dies, if Mary, who is Catholic, succeeds, she will return England to Catholicism, and this is especially a concern to them because they have already plundered the properties of the Catholic Church and do not want to give it back. Edward, the child King, is under the influence of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, his scheming trusted advisor. John Dudley marries his son to Jane, and persuades Edward on his deathbed to sign a document making Jane his successor. John Dudley has been prolonging Edward's life through arsenic, which keeps a person alive but in excruciating pain, just so he can have the time to persuade Edward to sign this document, poor kid. And so Jane becomes Queen of England for 9 days after Edward's death, until Mary manages to take over the throne.

The love story between Jane and Guilford Dudley, John Dudley's son whom she is married to, is particulary touching. I'm told it's not historically accurate, but that's okay. At first it is a loveless marriage, but they learn to love each other, and he gives her a lot of support when she finds herself Queen of England. At first, Guilford has been living a dissolute life, and he is jaded because of all the unethical things he sees his father doing. But after Jane becomes Queen of England, he and Jane try to enact laws that make the common people's lives easier. I'm told this is not historically accurate either, and it did strike me as unrealistic and overly idealistic in the movie.

It is so interesting and sad to see how these child monarchs are caught up in the adult world of political intrigue, and how they deal with it. The first child monarch is, of course, Edward, and then it's Jane and Guilford, and you see how Jane and Guilford deal with these adults who are trying to manipulate them. I thought it was neat the way Jane and Guilford try to manipulate the adults, though I'm not sure that was historically accurate either. It was a bit sad, since Jane and Guilford keep saying, ""Why can't we just go somewhere quiet and peaceful together and be happy and not deal with all this politics stuff.""

Of course, Jane gets overthrown eventually, and she and Guilford are beheaded. It's a sad story.

The movie was made in 1986, so maybe techinically it's not as great as we're used to, but it was okay. It stars Helena Bonham Carter when she was younger as Lady Jane, Cary Elwes (who was in The Princess Bride) as Guilford Dudley, and Patrick Stewart (from Star Trek) as Jane's father. Overall a good movie, though some people might find it dull and plodding.",1355961600,,2988,4.630188679245283
272200,3,6300214559,"After just watching this film, I have to say I am a bit disappointed. To start with a good note, the actors were brilliant, it was well filmed for the time, and it was an enjoyable fictional film. However, my excitement at coming across this film was due to my long study of English history, the period and the monarchy. This film was a complete disappointment as a hisorically accurate piece. The facts were entirely muddled, and the relationship between Jane and Guilford was utter nonsense. There is no evidence whatsoever that he was even kind to her much less in love with her. Jane had very little happiness in her upbringing from what we can find in history, and even less in her later years. Long story short, if you want to enjoy a good drama, it's a great film.

272232,4,6300214559,"The common complaint about this film since its release is the inaccuracy concerning the ""love story"" between Guildford and Jane.  It's certainly true that the couple were not the passionate lovers depicted in the movie:  the marriage itself was actually not consummated, per the orders of both sets of parents, until Edward VI was dead - an arrangement which suited Jane just fine.

What's also inaccurate is the portrayal of Jane and Guildford as sixteenth-century Socialists, fighting for the rights of peasants and pursuing economic justice in the form of a ""real shilling.""  In all probability, neither of them gave much of a rat's ass about the poor, in keeping with the attitudes of their own class:  Guildford was by most accounts a spoiled brat, and Jane, while undoubtedly intelligent (having been raised for a time under the tutelage of Queen Katharine Parr), was far more interested in ongoing Protestant reform than in social and economic reform.  Ironically, *had* Jane gone on to reign, it's quite likely that she would have been every bit as intolerant as Mary I in terms of religion.

So Jane and Guildford were hardly compassionate do-gooders determined to make the most of their tragically short lives, nor was theirs the romance of the ages.  This is still a fine movie -- beautifully filmed, well-acted, and - if you're willing to suspend the window of disbelief - a good tearjerker of a ""historical romance.""",1118534400,7,1429,4.974789915966387
272233,4,6300214559,"One of the most interesting instances of genetic and gender in the history of Western Civilization is found with the death of King Edward VI of England at the age of 15 in 1553.  Too young to leave heirs, his older half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth Tudor were both considered illegitimate because of the martial history of their father Henry VIII.  Going through the Tudor family the only other potential claimants, Mary of Scotland and Lady Jane Grey, were also female.  It seemed that God that determined that a woman would sit on the throne of England and the political question was who that woman would be.  The one with the best claim was Mary Tudor, but she was a devout Catholic and the creation of the Anglican Church had created a religious schism in England that would turn ugly with her on the throne.
Lady Jane first became connected with the English crown as a potential mate for young Edward, who was more interested in Mary of Scotland or another foreign princess.  Jane was supposedly betrothed to the duke of Somerset's son, Lord Hertford, but was then informed by her parents that she was to wed Guildford Dudley, the youngest son of the duke of Northumberland.  Handsome and only one year her senior, Jane did not like him and refused the marriage until her mother literally beat her into submission.  The couple were married in May of 1553 and lived apart, although the marriage was consummated the following month at the expressed command of Northumberland.  Jane was then informed that she had been named Edward's heir three days before the king's death.  Northumberland kept Edward's death a secret in order to stop Mary Tudor from claiming the crown and made a speech announcing Jane was the new queen.  Forced to accept the title, Jane dismissed the idea that her husband would be made king.  When Northumberland went forth with his army to meet that of Mary, who was marching on London, the royal council declared Mary queen and Jane's own father signed the declaration.  On November 13 Jane and Guildford we tried, convicted, and sentenced to death.  Jane believed the Queen would pardon her, but the revolt against Mary by Sir Thomas Wyatt in February 1554 hardened her heart against her enemies.  Within days Guildford was executed, with Jane being beheaded on February 11th.
None of this historical information consistutes a spoiler because anyone familiar with the kings and queens of England knows that there was never a Queen Jane and even those unfamiliar with the specifics of English history will be aware early on that this is going to be a tragic tale.  Even so, the 1986 film ""Lady Jane"" from director Trevor Nunn would more properly be considered a historical romance, with the emphasis more on the romance than the history as the marriage between Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) and Guilford (Cary Elwes) is turned into a tragic love story.  Jane is presented as an intellectual (you would like to see her and Elizabeth Tudor have a conversation), and given a sense of nobility in that she and her husband apparently intend to rule in their own names, not only because it will thwart the plans of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland (John Wood), but also because it is the right thing to do.  In bed they tend to talk about their idealistic plans, such as not branding men or sending them into slavery because they are starving.
This new version of Lady Jane's marriage and her new found political ambitions work to add to the tragedy of her execution at the hands of Bloody Mary, even though her being an unwilling pawn in the machinations of some one else's power games makes her enough of a tragic figure.  You have to appreciate the irony that these two privileged children of the British class system were idealistic friends of the common folk.  The cast features the standard collection of British character actors, with Michael Hordern as Doctor Feckenham, Mary's teacher, Jane Lapotaire as Princess Mary, Joss Ackland as Sir John Bridges, and Sara Kestleman as Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk and Jane's mother.  For me the low moment in the film is when Jane is betrayed by her father, especially since Patrick Stewart plays Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk.  Of course, both Bonham Carter and Elwes have gone on to much better films, although I was surprised that she made this after ""A Room With a View,"" one of those much better films. ""Lady Jane"" runs a bit long, especially given that Jane's ""reign"" only lasted nine days, and while the fictional romance has its moments I would hope that one day the bleak reality of what happened to this young girl becomes the subject of another film.",1085875200,9,4632,4.765
272234,4,6300214559,"Helena Bonham Carter stars as the young girl who for nine days was Queen of England.  Lady Jane Grey was Henry VIII's niece and a staunch Protestant.  Through political machinations, the dying King Edward (a teenager) makes his cousin Jane his successor, not the legitimate choice, his very Catholic sister Mary.  Jane is forced into an arranged marriage to facilitate the move and soon finds herself on a throne she never wanted.  Her husband gives her much support, and the two decide to make changes that will benefit the long suffering common man.  But Mary will not be denied her throne (and neither will her husband, the Spanish king).  Queen Jane is removed and condemned to death, quite a common fate back then.  The acting is tops, with Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes as her husband delivering excellent performances, surrounded by a cast of pros.  The sets, costumes, and other period details are terrific as well.  I wasn't expecting to see a romance film, which is what this movie develops into.  It's not very accurate, although the actors have a great chemistry and make it work.  I was expecting to see more of the political behind-the-scenes treachery, since the story of Lady Jane is rooted in religious conflict and personal ambition.  The politics of Tudor England are fascinating, and this film certainly deals with the political and religious climate, but I would like to have seen more.  Nonetheless, the film is well made and serves as a solid introduction to that critical time in English history.",1047600000,23,1519,4.88671875

Also Jane didn't love Guildford Dudley, they never had a love romance like in the movie at all.  This movie is mostly base on the beautiful love story between Jane and Guildford but that love story never existe is not accurate. I think the one who play Queen Mary was good and seem to have more character then the one in the more modern movie ""Elizabeth"" with Cate Blanchett.  Mary in the movie ""Lady Jane"" is not boring and plain like the one in the movie ""Elizabeth"".It's still is a beautiful and good movie.  I love the atmosphere in this movie and the beautiful costumes.

272236,4,6300214559,"This gem of a film is from Helena Bonham-Carter's ingenue days in which she captures the strength of the pious and studious Nine-Days Queen magnificently. Strangely, paintings show she bears a stronger resemblance to Guildford Dudley than Cary Elwes, who makes up for his lack of physical resemblance to Jane's slovenly, disreputable husband by turning out a charismatic and thoughtful performance.
 This rather heavy-handed account of Jane Grey's life has a lot of symbolism. In a very English hunting scene at the beginning (which closely resembles a Breughel painting), we see the elders in Jane's life closing in on a deer in much the same way they would trap Jane into serving their own corrupt ends. After Jane is whipped by her mother for her reluctance to marry the obnoxious Guildford Dudley, King Edward comforts her by giving her a puppet to play with. The symbolism of that moment at this point in the film is blantantly obvious.
 Michael Hordern's Father Fekenham is a comforting presence in Jane's life, despite their disagreements over religion. He never hides the amount of respect he has for the young girl.
 Inaccuracies of the film include the fact that Jane's parents, played by a hard-driven Patrick Stewart, and a ruthless Sarah Kestelman(who reaffirms the fact that the saintliness of Frances Grey's mother, Mary, who was Henry VIII's younger sister, truly skipped a generation)responded to Jane's initial refusal to marry Guildford by respectively slapping her in the face repeatedly and cursing her. While one is greatful that the audience is spared that, the nude scene between Jane and Guildford was a bit gratuitous, and as Jane was actually unwavering in her resentment of her chosen husband, it's highly unlikely that their union was consumated. But the earlier wedding scene was indeed, a phantasmagoria of white and gold, and beautiful to watch.
 After her scheming elders place her on the throne, there is no evidence that Jane became, as Americans might say, a forerunner to FDR. She took to her bed, grief-stricken over the loss of King Edward. There is some truth to Guildford's having provided some comfort to her at this time, and part of the dialogue that is heard in the initial coronation scene is based on historical fact.
 As Jane's Governess, Mrs. Ellen,played by Jill Bennett, stands by, a helpless witness to her brilliant charge's fate, Jane Lapotaire's gracefully portrayed Mary reclaims her throne, Henry Grey tears down the royal canopy, and all the conspirators, reluctant or otherwise, are placed under arrest. Jane bears these indignities, as she has many others throughout her life, with a courage and patience well beyond her years. John Dudley becomes a turncoat, deciding to return to Catholicism to save himself, much to the dismay of Guildford. But this scheme doesn't work. Jane and Guildford almost escape with their lives, until Henry Grey joins a rebellion to restore Jane to the throne.
 Certain scenes of Jane's final days in the tower were given better treatment in the 1936 film, "" Nine Days A Queen"", starring Nova Pilbeam, and John Mills. But in the scenes of Jane on the scaffold are, for the most part, well-reenacted in this film. The sense of sorrow witnesses have at the brutal death that is to be faced by a girl so young, so brilliant, so sweet, and so innocent is almost beyond expession. Even Queen Mary (I hesitate to call her ""Bloody Mary"" when her father killed more people and has more flattering nicknames ascribed to him only because he had better P.R.)must have sensed that hers would not be a blessed reign as a result of her having to execute her own cousin in order to marry a Spanish King and restore England to Catholicism.
 Frances Brandon Grey is shown curtseying to the Queen who has just executed her daughter and who would soon execute her husband. Ironically, she would become a court favorite with the Queen. But there is some sense of justice in the fact that history has not been kind to Jane Grey's parents.
 Trevor Nunn has given the world a sharp, glistening, stately, and lavish production filled with a great sense of period and place. Whatever inconsistancies this film may have with history,its loving homage to Jane Grey is well-paid.",1021161600,33,4241,4.938288920056101

One thing I do wish was included in the film is the time that Jane spent living at Catherine Parr's (Henry VIII's 6th wife) home with the future Queen Elizabeth and Catherine Parr's then husband, Thomas Seymour.  Apparently there were all sorts of things going on there between Bess and Tom and it would have been interesting to see how Jane reacted and dealt with that.

272256,5,6300214559,"This is a beautifully rendered period piece, with outstanding performances by the entire cast. A very young, petite and exquisite Helen Bonham Carter plays the title role of Lady Jane Grey, who was fifth in the line of succession to the throne of England upon the death of King Henry VIII in 1547. The first was Edward, King Henry VIII's only son. The second in the line of succession was Henry VIII's oldest daughter, Mary. The third was his other daughter, Elizabeth. The fourth was Lady Frances Grey, the Dutchess of Suffolk, and mother to Lady Jane Grey.

Upon the death of King Henry VIII, his only son, nine year old Edward, became King Edward VI of England. His uncle, the Duke of Somerset, brother to Edward's mother, Jane Seymour, third wife of Henry VIII, ruled as Regent. In 1552, he was removed and beheaded. The ruthlessly ambitious John Dudley, the feared Duke of Northumberland, took his place as Regent. Here, the role of John Dudley is marvelously played with implacable and sinister resolve by John Wood.
King Edward VI, touchingly played by William Saire, very much likes his cousin, the quiet, religious, and intelligent Lady Jane Grey, and treats her kindly. Both are devout believers in the Reformed Church. In fact, her ambitious mother, the Dutchess of Suffolk, marvelously played with icy malice by Sara Kestelman, expects that they will probably wed. She does not count on Edward dying a premature death. The Duke of Northumberland, however, knows that the King is ill and will probably die. He realizes that with Edward's death his Regency and all the power that such office confers will be no more.

So, in the Spring of 1953, he tells Frances that the King is ill and likely to die and proposes to Frances that Jane, instead, marry his somewhat dissolute youngest son, Guilford, dashingly played by the very young and handsome, Cary Elwes. Together they intrigue, as they know that Mary, a staunch Catholic, is next in the line of succession. Dudley tells her that since she is the fourth in the line of succession that she waive her rights to her daughter, Jane, who is fifth in line. He will have Edward sign a decree making Jane his successor, under the pretext of keeping the Reformed Church in and the Catholic Church out. This way England will remain Protestant.

When her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Suffolk, inform Jane of the proposed match, she protests and objects. After being beaten by her mother, she relents and marries Guilford. They fall in love as only the very young can, impractical and full of high ideals. Then, their bliss is rendered asunder, when the perfidy of both their parents becomes apparent upon the death of King Edward VI. Jane and Guilford are hustled out of their home and taken to Court. There, Jane is informed that Edward decreed her his successor. She becomes a most reluctant Queen at the age of sixteen. It was a reign that would last all of nine days.

What happens to Jane and Guilford, as well as all the other players in this first class drama, is well worth watching. In addition to the those performances already noted, Jane LaPotaire is magnificent as Queen Mary, and Patrick Stewart is marvelous as Henry Grey, the Duke of Suffolk, Jane's father, whose ill advised action in seeking to restore Jane to the throne was the functional equivalent of signing her death warrant himself. Look also for a touching performance by Jill Bennett in the role of Miss Ellen, Jane's attendant, who showed Jane the tenderness her parents failed to provide. With a first class cast and beautiful sets and costumes, this is a most enjoyable film. While not totally historically accurate, it is still a notable historical drama and a very enjoyable one at that.",1000512000,6,3726,4.772093023255814
272257,5,6300214559,I have been trying to track down a copy of this movie ever since I saw it back in 1986.  I went to the movies with my girlfriend and we cried for hours afterwards.  We then took her sister a few weeks later and started crying half-way through. I think the love story between Jane and Guildford is even better than Rose and Jack in Titanic.  I can't wait until my copy arrives here in Australia.,997833600,2,394,4.157894736842105
272258,4,6300214559,"The story of the real Lady Jane, tragic and fascinating, would make a wonderful screen play. Unfortunately, the writers of this film's script adapted a few facts and sandwiched stock, pat fiction in between.
Helena Bonham Carter, at once beautiful and earnest, does give the viewer a flavour of the intellectual, devout, and manipulated Jane, and the acting, scenery, and music are first rate and the reason for my high rating. There is a sense of Edward VI's concern for the sucession, how Jane was used as a pawn, and such historical truths as, for example, how the poor were reduced to destitution when there no longer was monastery land to farm.
Beyond that, the circumstances of Jane's life and brief reign are so distorted as to make the book verge on the farcical. Whatever factors there were in Jane's situation, no part of it was in any way a ""love story."" The depiction of the madly romancing couple managing all sorts of reforms (for example, ""their shilling"") within a matter of a week practically reduces Jane's story to camp. One could get the absurd impression that Jane's being manipulated, even beaten, into a marriage with Dudley was a piece of good fortune with a happy, if brief, outcome.
Of course, those who believe that history in no way matters are welcome to compose fictional love stories... but, when anyone had as intriguing a true story as did Jane, it is preferable for such love stories to not borrow her name.",997833600,,1441,4.745019920318725
272259,5,6300214559,"I believe that although this film is not historically accurate, the emotions expressed through the brilliant acting far outweigh any negative aspects. Sadly, it is true that Queen Jane was executed for something she was unwilling to do and had to be manipulated into.  As the great niece to King Henry VIII and cousin to Princesses Mary and Elizabeth, not to mention King Edward, she should have been treated as a Queen, not some common criminal of the time. One of the points that really irritates me is that once Mary was on the throne she married Philip of Spain who turned out to hate her and resent her for her lack of childbearing ability and then she fanatically burned Protestants at the stake and by the end of her 5 year miserable reign, the people were praying every day for Mary to die so her half sister Elizabeth could be Queen.  Jane, if she had been allowed to remain Queen would have done a lot of good for England.  The costumes were brilliant as was the scenery and above all the music-it is so moving and so heart wrenching, I want the soundtrack so badly, could someone email me if they know how to acquire it-see email above.  I just think this film is brilliant because it emphasises the youth of Jane when she was forced to marry and become Queen, then a brutal execution following the harping of that twisted crow Princess Mary-known as Bloody Mary.  It was a tragedy and yet I think ""their souls took flight to the world that is invisible and there arriving are sure of bliss and forever dwell in paradise"".",989625600,,1533,4.5
272270,5,6300214559,"I have seen this movie several times.  This last Sept. I had the great honor of actually visiting the Castle Warwick in England where Queen Jane reined.  There in the history book of who has reined in the Castle from the 1200 to current is Jane and a short account of her rein.  Although I'm sure the storyline has been altered for this movie, it is true that King Edward did approve of her marriage to Dudley & her father-in-law wanted her in power to be able to control the throne from Cathalithism.  I would recommend this movie to everyone if for nothing more than to tell you, YOU can make a difference if you stand up for what you believe.",971568000,,645,4.305785123966942
272271,3,6300214559,"Let's start with what's good about this movie.  The cast is wonderful, the costumes superb, etc.
And, they even got part of the history right.  In the 16th century people did argue passionately (and die) over religion, poor innocent Jane was the puppet of ruthlessly ambitious adults.
Blast it!  That dumb love story ruined the whoe movie.  There is absolutely no evidence that Jane and Guilford Dudley ever loved each other.  Nor did they attempt to reform the coinage, build public schools, redistribute income...  I think Jane's story is even more tragic when you realize that her horrible parents forced her into a loveless marriage to further their own ends.
But yet, the execution scene was true to the historical accounts. Can you imagine the horror of watching a blinfolded sixteen year old groping for the executioner's block, and asking:  ""Where is it?  What do I do?""
If you ever go to London, visit the British Library where Jane's prayerbook is on display.  The night before she died, she wrote a letter to her sister on the endpapers.  The handwriting never wavers.  What courage this innocent child had.",971395200,231,1118,4.8936170212765955

I am just getting into the history  of the monarchs in europe in the 16th century,and this movie seems to be  pretty historically accurate.""Lady Jane"" takes the viewer to an  emotional high and then an emotional low in about the span of 3  seconds.

We feel for the two young lovers so that we  would do anything to prevent the inevitable. Just knowing the fate of Lady  Jane almost reduced me to tears.
 The acting was superb, the scenery  stunning, and the costumes both lavish and breath-taking.
 And if *that*  doesn't tempt you enough, then I have two words to add. Cary Elwes. You may  remember him from The Princess Bride and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Not  only is he a terrific actor, but he gets the job done looking *incredible*.  He alone is reason enough to make this purchase.",964137600,2,713,4.340909090909091

272278,2,6300214559,"No, no and again no; I simply cannot agree that this is a good film.  While I accept that when some, if not most, historical facts are either embellished or plain ignored in films it is sometimes less unnecessary than  others the complete re-writing and re-structuring of this film based upon  the life, ""reign"" and death of Henry VIII's great niece Lady Jane  Grey (later Lady Jane Dudley) is proposterous.  Plucked at a tender young  age was fresh-faced Helena Bonham-Carter to play this role and while she  shows promise as the wily, naive and confused young royal there comes a  point when her constant wining gets tedious and irritating.
The web of  treachory spun by the manipulative, ruthless and really rather nasty adults  in this film who abused their power over her and her young husband Guilford  Dudley for their own means is certainly apparent enough and certainly makes  you hate them but somehow it all seems a bit to Dynasty-like and therefore  not totally believable.
And what with all the pious and over the top  ""we have the chance to make a better world"" attitude by the young  protagonists?  Did this even exist?  I highly  doubt it; while I am sure  they were nice enough people they were also young and rich and probably  didn't give much thought to the less fortunate among them at a grass-roots  level.
But one thing it possibly did get right was the love affair  between Jane and Guilford; although I don't know it has a fact I have good  reason to believe that although the marriage was arranged by their  conniving parents they did eventually fall in love once hitched and this  was very clear in the film.
Interestingly enough Guilford's brother  Robert was a favourite of Jane's cousin-once-removed Elizabeth; yep the  very same Queen Elizabeth I and he didn't have the most squeaky clean of  reputations either.",960854400,6,1843,4.765079365079365
272279,4,6300214559,"For Historical Dramas, Hal Wallis is superb. Mary, Queen of Scots and Anne of The Thousand Days were both excellent movies. Lady Jane could have received Five Stars except for the historical misrepresentation of her head  over heels love for Guildford Dudley, whom she at best tolerated.  Lady  Jane was a victim of parents who were cowards, especially her mother Lady  Frances Brandon who ""waived"" her right to the Throne of England  as well as the death by beheading sure to follow an unsuccessful usurpation  of the Crown. Lady Frances had the Tudor ruthlessness as well as a streak  of cruelty towards her daughter absent in other members of the Tudor Royal  Family.  Jane's mother was first cousin to English Queens MARY and  ELIZABETH as well as King EDWARD VI and JAMES V of Scotland but this was  barely touched on in the movie. John Wood's performance as Northumberland  is superb as is Jean Laportaire as MARY TUDOR.  It is ironic that MARY's  mother Catherine of Aragon's marriage was conditional on the beheading of  the last male Plantagenet, demanded by Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain of  HENRY VII while their granddaughter MARY was forced to execute another  royal claimant of Tudor and Plantagenet blood as a condition to marry  Archduke Philip, Prince of Spain - and as with her mother resulted in a  wretched life and miserable sad death for both mother and daughter whom  many claimed at the time were cursed as a result of shedding innocent blood  for their marriages.  Lady Jane's mother Frances, Duchess of Suffolk  married very quickly after the death of her daughter and husband as she was  pregnant by her horse master Adrian Stokes.  The baby died and so did the  scheming duchess whom history doesn't record as having plead to her cousin  Queen Mary for her daughter's life.  The duchess should have been the one  beheaded, not her daughter the innocent pawn Lady Jane.  As a historical  note the Queen Mother of England is descended from Lady Jane's sister  Katherine Grey, while Cary Elwes who played Guildford Dudley is actually  descended from Guildford Dudley's elder brother Ambrose Dudley, Earl of  Warwick. Another irony is the last male Plantagenget who was executed by  HENRY VII was also styled Earl of Warwick.  Lady Jane and Guildford Dudley  were also distantly related by being descended from England's King EDWARD  I, the king made infamous by the movie BRAVEHEART which was entertaining  but historically almost worthless as a work of non fiction.",953078400,22,2493,4.9156626506024095

This movie inspired me to study  and learn more about her tragic life, such as the fact that she is listed  in Foxe's Book of Martyrs for her choice of death over recanting her  beliefs.

And there are excellent portrayals from John Wood as the scheming and  ruthless Duke of Northumberland and Warren Saire as the dying boy-king  Edward VI.Cary Elwes as the reluctant but doomed bridegroom Guilford Dudley  proves here he's not just a pretty face.

Of course she was rather young at the time of this production, but the effect was still exceptionally good. So was most of the acting, being true to the English tradition of producing really remarkably good actors. As nearly as I can remember from what I have read, this film seemed to be historically faithful in relating the very brief reign of Lady Jane Grey, before Henry III's daughter Mary grabbed the throne.

The problem is solved when she triumphantly changes into a man's outfit. Her husband is amused - and approves.)  The movie makes a good effort to depict the intrigue and backstabbing (even of one's own family) to gain power at the highest levels.
