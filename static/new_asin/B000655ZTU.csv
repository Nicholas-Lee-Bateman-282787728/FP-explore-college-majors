While many thought the atom shoudl be used to create nearly free electricity for the masses, other people saw the potential to create the most devestating bombs the world would ever know.

Even more worrisome, some people would argue, was that there was so much energy in the atom that even using it to simply make power caused a huge risk to the general population if and when an accident should occur.

In the 1950s the american government wanted to explore both the energy and weapons potential of the atom, but knew that they would need to generate public support for both projects.

This would not be an easy sell - because many people were generally terrified of any use of atomic energy.

Therefore the propoganda boys stepped in and made films designed to not only explain the power of the atom to the american people, but to also sell them on the idea that we needed both nuclear power and nuclear weapons.

What's interesting about these films is that they show that the essential debate has not changed much over the years. We are still discussing the same concerns and fears - even though our atomic understanding is far, far greater than it was back in the 1950s.

I like the way the producers of this package allow the footage to build up slowly with benign uses for nuclear energy and then hit us with the bigger more modern and far more dangerous explosion clips towards the end.

All in all these are important films that have earned their way into history.",1162857600,,1694,4.5493421052631575

The premise of all the clips here is that the government was building bigger and bigger bombs to beat the commies and at the same time trying to get nuclear power going and popular no matter what the case.

What they did was create a bunch of propoganda films designed to make people love the bomb and all things nuclear. It's like something out of the Ministry of Truth.

I can't imagine what it must have been like to grow up in a time when people watched and beleived these things and I'm glad I got a chance to see them because it gives me a good sense of just how far the government will go to convince people that what they want is good for the country.",1146700800,,795,4.116129032258065
