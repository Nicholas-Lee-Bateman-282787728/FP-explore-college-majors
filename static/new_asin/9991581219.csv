7901845,5,9991581219,"This is a fabulous (not an exaggeration to use that term) way to encounter the delightful, brilliant, insightful Eckhart Tolle - whose book, ""The Power of Now"" is also pretty super - as is his subsequent book ""A New Earth' --- Tolle is like a great modern voice of Krishnamurti, Maitreya (the World Teacher), and ACIM (A Course in Miracles) combined, and perhaps with a sprinkling of Sai Baba, Sri Ramana Maharshi, and the incomparable Benjamin Creme.",1408924800,,451,4.87012987012987
