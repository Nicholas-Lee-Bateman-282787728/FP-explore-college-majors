481519,4,6302503795,"The weekest cartoon in this is ""Rudolph's Shinny New Year.  BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 300 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA.

A year after delivering Christmas presents, Santa Claus receives a letter from his friend Father Time asking for help to find Happy the Baby New Year before midnight on New Year's Eve, or else it will be December 31 forever. Santa sends Rudolph out to find him. An evil vulture called Eon the Terrible is supposed to live for exactly one Eon after which he will turn into ice and snow and disintegrate. As his particular Eon will end January 1 of the New Year, he plans to kidnap Happy to keep the year from ending and stop time, thus preventing his predestined death

This Rankin/Bass Production is a sequel to the beloved Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Where the original had heart and charm to spare this special offers nothing inventive. (Besides if you knew you were going to die wouldn't you do everything you could to prevent it).

I fully understand why Rankin-Bass would want to make another Holiday Special that featured Rudolph. However that special was told with more heart than this. It gave us such memorable characters and songs that they have become part the fabric of Christmas itself.

Over the years other ""Rudolph"" sequels followed but none of them ever has captured the pure joy of that classic cartoon.

This special isn't too bad but compared to the original it comes across as cold and distant.

The Year Without a Santa is a Classic and should be seen by all.  The Year Without a Santa Claus is a 1974 Christmas stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions. The story is based on Phyllis McGinley's 1956 book of the same name, illustrated by Kurt Werth. It was originally broadcast on December 10, 1974 on ABC.

This could be a sequel to ""Santa Claus is Coming To Town"" and it is in a spiritual way. Their is however isn't. The animation is different and the elves in this special are not the same elves we see in ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"". It is however produced by the same company (Rankin/Bass) and Mickey Rooney voices ""Santa"" in this special as well.

Now in this film ""Santa"" decides to not deliver presents this year because he sees that people no longer have ""Christmas Spirit"" and no longer believe in Santa.

In an effort to save Christmas Mrs. Claus dispatches two elves out into the world to prove to Santa wrong.

Now this special has the now classic songs from ""The Heatmiser"" and ""Mr Snow"". There is however 2 other songs that should of been cut or re-worked. Then again that is just my opinion

This special is a true classic. To call it ""One of the crown jewels of Holiday Programming"" would not do it justice. It is one of the finest programs ever produced for TV.

This special really gained a huge following once it hit Home Video. ABC held the rights for TV broadcast for years but seldom aired the special. After it became obvious that this special was loved by millions ABC began running it again on ""ABC FAMILY"" and the ""ABC Network"". The same thing happened with ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" that special was also returned to the ABC Network because of its huge following. That special was syndicated for years. ABC has now re- gained broadcasting rights.

Nestor the Long Ear Christmas Donkey is not as well known as the others but it is still a gem..  In this special a donkey that helps brings Mary to Bethlehem.  His deformity becomes an asset to mankind",1505347200,2,3714,4.577677224736048

481881,3,6302503795,"The main movie is great - silly old thing brought back a lot of memories. My lower rating, however, is for the special features - the other movies included in this ""deluxe edition"" didn't work. They stopped and started, pauses all the way through. We managed to watch the one about the religious donkey, but the Rudolph sequel wouldn't work at all. The disk looked fine, no scratches or anything, so it was the quality of the recording. Why have a ""deluxe"" version with extra movies if the extra movies don't work? Ridiculous. But hey, at least the main movie works - and that's what we bought it for - the Miser Brothers - love those guys.",1483488000,,640,4.478632478632479

In it, I put hot chocolate packets, popcorn, new pjs for each child, and a new Christmas DVD of some sort. I did ask my kids(the parents) if they had a preference just to see what they said. My youngest wanted this. It made me happy to be able to share a classic like this with my grandkids that I know their mom loves too. If you haven't seen this one, watch it and share it with your kids. I loved it when I was a kid, so did my kids. Now my grandkids too! It's the full version I watched when I was 8 in 1974, and it has extra Christmas bonus features too.

482989,5,6302503795,"If I could, I would give this a 4.5. It loses a star for the fact that the Miser Brothers really do have unnecessarily confusing names. (Really. A ""snow *miser*"" would hoard snow, not give it away. Same with heat.) But it regains a half star for the extras after the movie including an interview with Ray Harryhausen about stop motion animation!

Still the Miser Brothers number is the highlight of the show. So much so that even decades after first seeing it, that scene is the majority of what I remember about this special. The rest of the show is a serviceable story about Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus. Though I kind of wish that it was a little better tied to Here Comes Santa Claus. A little nod to it would have been Santa calling himself Mr. Kringle when asked who he is instead of Klaus. But that is minor. All in all, I enjoyed it as a boy and I enjoy it to this day.",1482105600,,875,4.208333333333333

What is nice is that this DVD is the deluxe edition so not only do you get The Year without a Santa Claus, you also get two other movies: Rudolph's Shiny New Year and Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey.

I was never a ""supplement"" user as I hated all the conflicting info on what was safe, ""proprietary"" ingredients, and such. After seeing them appear on my timeline I did some research and it seemed these guys just wanted to produce simple products with quality ingredients without hype or the latest fad. I entered and won. After using the Build and Blast I felt and saw results without any jitters or unwanted side effects. I see more definition of my appearance (as does my wife) and feel good going into workouts and crave spending more time at my fitness center. I am happy because this stuff works, plain and simple. Just like the days of ""old school"". Try it out. There is really nothing to lose as they are truly affordable and no guessing what you are consuming.",1424563200,,843,4.516339869281046

It is entertaining and isn't one of the more modern ""specials"" that serves only as an introduction to the line of toys that they will have to have afterwards. I don't have to recommend it.

We watched all three with our granddaughters ages 21 and 33 months and they loved all of them. Nestor was the particular favorite, but all were very enjoyable to relive the shows I had watched as a child with my granddaughters. the 3 year old did get a bit upset during Rudolphs Shiney New year by Eon the flying condor/vulture. But, after we convinced her that Rudolph would win and save Happy she was still suspicious, but happy to learn that Rudolph would win! There are happy, sad, and scarey parts in each of the shows, but that is life and delivered with good messages.

484683,2,6302503795,"First, I love the video.  I believe the high ratings for this are for the video, not the blu ray edition.  Heat Miser and Snow Miser are awesome.  When I watched my DVD of Rudolph this year, I thought of how nice it would be to see it full screen and in Hi Def on my TV like it would be to watch the broadcast.  With that in mind, I purchased the blu ray of Year Without a Santa.  To me, on my HD TV, there was not much of a difference between the DVD and blu ray.  It didn't make it full screen, and to me, it didn't look totally sharp- I suspect this was from how it was filmed, I don't know.  If you don't own it, the price difference between DVD and blu ray is up to you.  If you're like me and already own it on DVD, I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.",1418515200,4,758,3.7531645569620253

484839,5,6302503795,"My first review got deleted and I have no idea why. It was a 100% positive review. LOL :) Maybe because I listed the specific 'you pee see' code for this product so people knew which version to get? I did it because Amazon lumps the reviews for different video formats all together and it can get confusing on which version to buy. They aren't all the same ... some have scenes cut, different soundtracks, etc etc, and there is a lot of negative comments about the versions of this movie with deleted scenes.

So ... here is what I originally wrote, minus the you pee see code.

.........................

Sometimes it's hard to tell which version of movie to get with the way Amazon lumps together all the reviews for different formats.

This review is for the Blu-ray version. (This line edited to remove you pee see.)

I recently watched this on TV and was shocked, and quite honestly, offended at all the scenes that were deleted. They ruined a very special memory from my childhood and that's what prompted me to come to Amazon to try and find the uncut versions of the Rankin Bass Christmas classics.

The Amazon description says it is Widescreen but it is not quite. In order for it to look right, I have to set my TV to Widescreen, but it doesn't fill the whole screen if that makes sense.

For those looking for the complete, uncut, full original soundtrack version of The Year Without A Santa Claus on Blu ray, this is the version to get. It looks as good as it will ever look, which is pretty darn good.

All the scenes people complain about being deleted are here.

This also has Rudolph's Shiny New Year and Nestor The Long Eared Christmas Donkey as bonus movies. Both of those look great as well and appear to be the full uncut, unedited versions that originally aired on TV.",1389139200,17,1789,4.48

***** For some reason, no one can issue a critical review of this blu-ray without being thumbed down for it, NO MATTER HOW ACCURATE AND HELPFUL IT IS. (I saw this with another negative review for this product, which was an excellent review.) Already there is a thumbs-down for this review despite the accuracy and detail of the review . . . sheesh! Lovers of this show: PLEASE don't thumb down this review just because you love this program and I say it's not as good as the great Rankin/Bass productions; or because I say the sound goes nearly mute every time a song comes on; as these are FACTS. This knowledge may be HELPFUL to a future buyer, which is what reviews are SUPPOSED to be judged on-- their helpfulness to shoppers considering the item. If you automatically thumb-down every review wherein the reviewer doesn't like a product you love, you are saying that unless the reviewer has your taste, his review cannot be helpful--facts be d_mned. Those of you who do this seem to feel that products you like deserve 5 stars, and that someone pointing out a negative, non-debatable fact, such as that the songs on this blu-ray ALL go into low volume (as I have pointed out), is just a bad reviewer without anything helpful to add. But you are doing a disservice to people who want to read accurate, FACTUAL reviews that discuss the pros and CONS. Thank you. *****

I am not one who thinks this story is so great, not least of all because they have Mrs. Santa Claus (Shirley Booth) narrating HER OWN STORY-- while she uses all kinds of accolades (so, it sounds a bit arrogant??); whereas using the Burl Ives Snow Man-- a 3rd-party observer-- in the classic Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer, was so MUCH more appropriate and smarter.

This program was mildly entertaining, but really they strained to make anything happen plot-wise; the plot was poorly developed, as were the characters.  This isn't anywhere near the caliber of the original Rudolph, The Red-nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, or The Little Drummer Boy, which represent the absolute best of Rankin/Bass.  Not even close.

""Snow Miser""?  ""Heat Miser""?  Seriously, where were they shown to be ""miserly"" with their snow or heat except in the OTHER brother's domain???  My family saw this show as kids when it debuted in the mid-1970s, and we thought much about it was dumb THEN, and well below the creativity and quality of the other Rankin-Bass shows.  It seems the people who wrote this and those who produced it were unimaginative people who had little creativity, even when it comes to coming up with better names for the villainous brothers.  Oh, and WHY, in the first place, there was any relevance of heat and cold (and brothers who control temperature) to a story of why Santa Claus didn't want to make his rounds one year due to a lack of enthusiasm, and the existence of cynicism, among children . . . I cannot connect the dots back to hot and cold weather.  A stupid plot.  (Those who love this show, please don't give me a thumbs-down because you love it and I disagree; I am providing accurate critical feedback for future buyers, and the dumbness of the plot details isn't really a matter of opinion, it's a fact.)

My biggest complaint is with the fact that, every time they launch into a song on this blu-ray, the sound (its volume) goes down by 80% or more-- it becomes nearly inaudible.  For EVERY song.  Raising the volume setting sky-high helps very little. I am surprised that I haven't seen any complaint about this among the reviews here; I own about 180 blu-rays and maybe 1500 DVDs, and this is my first such experience.  The songs are audible, but barely.  Then, when it returns to normal dialog, the volume returns to normal.

Lastly, they couldn't have chosen a worse narrator-- Shirley Booth has a horrible, nasal, NY twang that sounds so whiny and street-tough.  She calls 'em the ""MIZA brothas"". And WHO said she could sing?  When she sings, the sound is far worse than nails on a blackboard. Whatever happened to using someone with a pleasant-sounding voice, such as those who voiced Wilma and Betty on the Flintstones originally, or frankly, just about any female voice actor around . . . except Shirley Booth.

The blu-ray picture quality is good, not blu-ray great, but is nothing to complain bout.

Sorry, this is sub-par for Rankin/Bass compared with their wonderful library, Shirley Booth is just horrible, and the defectively-low volume for every song makes this a problem blu-ray.",1388361600,,4532,4.723350253807107

484911,5,6302503795,"I absolutely love this trilogy of Christmas classics by Rankin and Bass; they give the holiday season much needed illumination and perspective. The 1974 classic The Year Without a Santa Claus has the signature stop motion animation that was a Rankin Bass staple for a decade running. Here, Santa has every intention of staying home, while Mrs. Claus tries to save Christmas with the help of those iconic brothers, Heat and Snow Miser. When I think of this special, I think of the Miser brothers. Next, there's Rudolph's Shiny New Year, which is a very refreshing break from the Christmas specials, with its focus on New Years and ensuring it happens. The narrator of this one is Red Skelton, who does a fine job as another iconic entertainer who gets the call. I like this special, in that it's different, dark at times, but the story can be a tad hard to follow for the very young. Still, there's plenty of eye candy for the little ones. Finally, there's Nestor the Long Eared Christmas Donkey, which is a story that tugs at the heart strings, and is borderline depressing, yet carries a good message. At only 22 minutes, it gets to the point, and is one of the truly underrated Rankin and Bass Christmas specials. I like this one, along with The Little Drummer Boy, as they don't try to dance around the origins of Christmas, like so many specials of today do. Overall, this DVD is money well spent, and a must-have for those who love the nostalgic Christmas specials of yesteryear.",1386288000,,1484,4.64638783269962

Presents started rolling toward Santa's front door.  Santa sat there blinking, but nobody knew what he was thinking.  Now, what will Santa do with all those presents?

485046,5,6302503795,"My daughter (6) loves these stories (have had them for two Christmas seasons now).

I love them *still* ~ they remind me of my Christmases as a child...when they would be played on TV at Christmastime.

I so enjoy the simpler animation...  After a while, as amazing as the super-up-to-date, technological, uber-digital movies can be, I prefer the more simplified animated show.

*****These are also pre-""change""******

For example, in ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"", at one point of the movie Santa blows his nose (after getting teary-eyed) and says, ""God bless my soul.""

Uhhhhhh....you can't put a price on THAT anymore...  In this day and age?  I'll take that over any super-modern movie any day of the week and two trillion times on Christmas!

The story of Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey is about a sweet, misfit donkey who is bullied and belittled by his peers because of his long ears but he eventually becomes the ""chosen"" donkey...  Mary and Joseph pick him to be the donkey that carries Mary to the place of Jesus' birth...  Beautiful...  Yes...and at the end, he's revered by those that once treated him poorly :)

Rudolph's Shiny New Year is always a favorite...  I think I especially love Morey Amsterdam as ""O.M."" (short for One Million), the caveman that Rudolph befriends on an Archipelago Island.  Another good story with layers of history, kindness and hope.

HIGHLY recommend...even if only to keep more good and God in your fun, Christmas viewing.",1360108800,2,1477,4.919028340080971

I had never seen ""Nestor, the Long-Eared Donkey"" and it will seem cheesy to the average older child of the 21st century (namely my son), but it is awesome for the younger child and for the adult who never seemed to grow up (namely ME  LOL).  This DVD also contains ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" which has a special place in my heart as what I watched around Christmas in a Mexican hospital when I was 19 because it was one of two programs I could get in English, but that is another story.

I love to watch the Shiny New Year cartoon in between Christmas and New Years and even the background music while you look at the menus is festive on this DVD.  It is definitely worth the money and I watched it all this year around the holidays.  I can't wait until next year when I don't have to wait to see when these shows are on; I can watch them at any time.

However, it does not wear well with age. I have no idea how others see this as being the best of the Rankin/Bass bunch. I would say it's slightly above ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"", but not by much, where most of the 1960s specials are far superior. However, there are two extras here, as well. The first, ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"", with Red Skelton, is just okay. In fact, my wife and I were pretty bored, but when it came to ""Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey"", my wife was enthralled.

485105,5,6302503795,"Given my mid-1960s birthdate, I am squarely in the generation that animated Christmas classics--from ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" to the Grinch to ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer""--were originally made for. Back in the days before DVDs and even before VCRs (yes, Virginia, there were such prehistoric times) we would eagerly wait for the Christmas specials to be shown on teevee. We gathered in front of the teevee and if you missed that showing, you had to wait an entire year for the special to be broadcast again. I can't help but thinking, in a 'you kids get off my lawn"" type of way, that my kids are missing a little something, having these specials at their ifngertips on DVD or instant video to watch whenever they want. No anticipation, none of that ""this only happens once a year so it's special"" feeling.

I have always had a soft spot in my heart for ""The Year Without a Santa Claus."" Not quite as well known as the Grinch or Charlie Brown, I still loved this Rankin-Bass stop-motion special. When the show begins, Santa is getting a cold and rendered cranky by what he perceives as the ingratitude of children for what he does. Egged on by his doctor, he decides to take the year off. No Santa Claus, and therefore no presents, no filled stockings, no joy for children all over the world.

Two of Santa's elves, Jingle and Jangle, decide to venture into the world to see if they can find some Christmas spirit that might change Santa's mind. They take a flying reindeer with them, and end up in a small town, Southtown, in the southern U.S. Dressed oddly, with a reindeer in tow, the elves get into trouble. They make a deal with the mayor: if they can make it snow in Southtown on Christmas, he will believe they are Santa's elves and let them all go.

In order to make it snow in the south on Christmas, the elves--now accompanied by Mrs. Claus (the voice of Shirley Booth)--visit the brothers who control the weather. Heat Miser will only agree to let it snow in Southtown if his brother Snow Miser gives up the North Pole and lets it be warm there for a day. Mrs. Claus resorts to a higher authority, Mother Nature.

In the meantime, Santa, worried about the elves and reindeer, dresses as a civilian and tries to track down his missing colleagues. He runs into some people who convince him that true Christmas spirit still exists. After the children of the world send Santa touching notes and gifts, he decides to make his rounds as usual.

Why do I love this special so much?
1. The voices-- including Shirley Booth as Mrs. Claus, Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, and the actors playing Heat Miser and Snow Miser.
2. The over-the-top production numbers by Heat Miser and Snow Miser when they first grant an audience to the elves and Mrs. Claus.
3. Great (albeit hokey) songs that you can't stop singing
4. Adorable stop-motion animation
5. Childhood nostalgia

I also like that it includes three different movies, all of which are equally enjoyable.

This cold reality (pun intended) made me think of my arsenal of Christmas DVDs, which is all of two, and the only one I haven't reviewed yet on Amazon - The Year Without A Santa Claus (1974).  I used to like this when I was a kid.  In fact, I liked it better than Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty The Snowman, Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, etc.  I don't know what I was thinking back then (much like I don't know what I'm thinking writing a review of this in August), because watching this now makes me realize that it has something major in it that I don't care for and forgot about until I bought the DVD in 2004 - it has way too much singing in it.  A song here and there is fine, but it seems like there's a song a minute.  The story is good, but there's a little too much singing.  Mickey Rooney voices Santa Claus and Shirley Booth voices Mrs. Claus.

This DVD also comes with two other stop-motion animation stories - Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey, and Rudolph's Shiny New Year.  These two are OK, but pretty much forgettable.

  Things just might heat up for you too--if you pay close to $20 for the Blu Ray only to find out that two of the three won't look much better than the dvd version. Actually, of the three titles on this disc (also includes ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" and ""Nestor-the long eared donkey"") only ""The Year without a Santa Claus"" is enhanced to 1080p resolution. A real shame, because all three are personal favorites of mine. On those  two, I had to select 4:3 HD to keep the original apsect ratio on my monitor's settings. I would say they look better unconverted in this mode setting. YWASC also had it's sound upgraded to 5.1 sound, which is not bad. I would say that even the original 1.0 mono sound on the other two works just fine. A couple of short bonus features round out the disc. One about the origin of the production and another for a primer about stop animation. If you are a big Rankin/Bass fan, then keep an eye out for a good deal--because I would still recommend the disc because of the improvements to YWASC.",1291593600,3,1136,4.374407582938389

One of the best qualities of this movie is that it is unpolished. It isn't perfect stop motion animation and that is what gives it its charm. I really enjoyed The Nightmare Before Christmas ( i own it too) but the flawless stop motion took away from it, a little, for me. Sometimes imperfection IS perfection. The story here is pretty straight forward, read the synopsis and you've got it. The most memorable parts of this move, of course, are snow and heat miser. They stole the show even though they don't have much screen time over all. This movie has a child like magic and charm (with out being childish) that just isn't anywhere to be found anymore. The Christmas movies today could take a page or two from the older classic Christmas shows (fred claus was awful imo).

Still, I was a little nervous about spending close to $20 on an HD upgrade.  Luckily it turned out to be worth it.  This is a very colorful movie and nothing shows that better than 1080p.  Every snow flake and sun drop and jingle bell lights up the screen fabulously and any long time fan of the movie will notice the spectacular difference immediately.

Unfortunately, the movie itself is the only feature in high definition on this release.  There are a great variety of extras, but they are all in standard definition.

Here's a list of the bonus features:

- Rudolph's Shiny New Year
- Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey
- We Are Santa's Elves
- School of Stop Motion

Overall, I'm very satisfied.  I came to experience an HD The Year Without a Santa and that's what I got.

485350,4,6302503795,"Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass productions ruled the Christmas TV landscape in my childhood.  SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN, RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER, FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and on an on.  This production/direction team put out three holiday specials in the late 1960s, took a break and then went full steam ahead starting in 1974 with a dozen new programs over the following 7 years, and one last lone attempt in 1985.  What's interesting is that they did both conventional animation and stop-motion, but it all has very much the same house style - big, cherubic faces, a whiff of Victorian style even in more modern stories, a pretty even mixture of humor and sentimentality.  They always got older members of ""Hollywood royalty"" to tell the stories, too - Burl Ives, Fred Astaire, Gene Autry, and in this case Shirley Booth.

I'm pretty sure I saw The Year Without A Santa Claus on its first broadcast, when I was 9, and like every other kid who saw it at that age I loved Heat Miser and Snow Miser - and I still do.  The story is the weakest and silliest element here - Santa decides to stay home for Christmas one year, deciding that there's no spirit of Christmas left (based mostly on a one-minute exchange with his doctor), and it's up to his resourceful wife and a couple of rather stupid elves to teach him that it isn't so, by dredging up some real Christmas spirit in the American city of Southtown.  C'mon, would Santa really just stay home?  And wouldn't it be a little more exciting if he didn't meet a couple of Santa-believing adults first thing in Southtown?

Ah, no matter, it's kids' stuff after all and one thing that did - and does - set this above most of the other shows of this vintage is that none of the songs are truly lame, which cannot be said for RUDOLPH or SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.  No sappy love songs here; ""I Believe in Santa Claus"" comes closest to mush but it doesn't go over the edge.  The humor and petulant childishness in the Miser brothers scenes still works - they remind me of my brother and I, always fighting, and is it a coincidence that ""miser"" calls to mind that most famous Christmas character, Scrooge?

The voice work by Shirley Booth and Mickey Rooney (Mr & Mrs Claus) and Dick Shawn and George Irving (the Misers)  is quite excellent, and it's nice to see a Christmas special with strong-willed women (Mrs. Claus and, later, Mother Nature who has to teach her boys the Miser brothers something about getting along) for a change.  The stop-motion animation retains its charm to me, even if the reindeer do look sort of drugged and the North Pole is pretty featureless.

485366,5,6302503795,"Have you heard? Christmas has been cancelled! Santa Claus (voice of Mickey Rooney) believes that there is no Christmas spirit left in the world. Why deliver presents to children who don't even care? So old Saint Nicholas declares a sick day and decides to stay in bed. His elves Jingle Bells and Jangle Bells can't believe it. Mrs. Claus (voice of Shirley Booth), however, is determined to keep her husband's gift-giving tradition alive (whether he likes it or not!). She sends Jingle and Jangle out into the world to find an example of good will so that Santa will change his mind. The elves, along with Vixen the reindeer, head for Southtown, USA...and head right into trouble! First Vixen is snatched by the town dog catcher. When Jingle and Jangle appeal to the mayor to let her go, he laughs at them. The mayor won't release their reindeer unless they use ""elf magic"" to make it snow in Southtown (where it hasn't snowed in 100 years). There's only way to get it to snow, so Jingle and Jangle, Mrs. Claus, and a local boy named Iggy (who thinks believing in Santa is for ""little kids"") pay a visit to the Snow Miser. Sorry, Santa, I've got to cheer for the ""Bad Guys"" here because the scenes with the tall, cool Snow Miser fighting with his short, hot-tempered step-brother Heat Miser are the best part of the show! You can't help but sing along when the brothers introduce themselves (""I'm Mr. Heat Miser, I'm Mr. Sun...). And I love Snow Miser's chilly sense of humor...

Snow Miser: ""How's your hubby, Mrs. Claus?""
Mrs. Claus: ""He's got a bad cold, I'm afraid.""
Snow Miser: ""He should've come to me. I would've given him a good one!""

My family and I watch this show every year and it never gets old. Even viewers who think they're too old for Santa will enjoy this classic animated television special.",1259884800,4,1810,4.583333333333333

485375,5,6302503795,"TYWSC is an animation masterpiece by the remarkable Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rankin/Bass had a prolific stretch of productions using stop-motion puppet animation (""Animagic""), beginning with the ever-popular Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer in 1962.

Many of these Rankin/Bass ""Animagic"" productions are interesting on several levels, since they often pulled the holiday away from religious moorings (with a couple of exceptions) and contributed to the huge holiday commercial machine (music, decorations, TV, now video and DVD) but at the same time celebrated the secular-humanist qualities of Christmas, such as cheer and pleausure of giving or sharing for their own sake. TYWSC, like some of these others, is in fact a pagan, feminist and still moralizing tour de force.

485442,2,6302503795,"First, let me say that I own this movie because it still retains it's charm more than three decades later, and still get a kick out of it. I can recall watching it on TV when I was a kid, and would sing the catchy Miser's songs. So having it on hand to watch it every year at Christmastime is a pleasure.

I was looking forward to upgrade from my older DVD of YWASC to this ""Deluxe Edition"" since I was keen on seeing a couple of documentaries and noted the product being advertised as ""Newly Remastered"". Well, in looking at the ORIGINAL 2000 DVD release, I realized that it is quite sharp in picture, as well as having a decent mono audio track. I noticed there were scarcely any grain or dirt on this print. So maybe I could not see a need to upgrade after all, and, as it turns out, I was correct in my assumption. I rather like to make picture comparisons with different DVD releases of a favorite movie, and I did the same with YWASC. Much to my surprise, the image is not only NOT an improvement, but to my eyes, in some instances has less sharpness and is duller in the colors! Again, in the first DVD release, one can see the finest details in say the puppet's hairs. Great clarity. With this new edition, there are periodic (though admittedly minor) inconsistancies in image. It is indeed puzzling that such a reduction in clarity (and I do know that the overwhelming majority of folks wouldn't know of them--and further, would not detract from their viewing enjoyment).

Sorry, I know I could get flack for what might be considered a minor quibble, but I feel that, apart from two (fairly interesting) documentaries, one could just as well not bother to invest in this repackaging of what was an already very adequate DVD release.

But either way, by all means enjoy and share with the family. Along with Rankin and Bass' other, earlier classic, Rudolph, The Red-nosed Reindeer, Year Without A Santa Claus is a gem that will charm for generations. So let me make very clear that the two-star rating is for this DVD release, of which the content is a decent four star.",1197417600,65,2078,4.463157894736842

485522,5,6302503795,"Last night NBC introduced a live action version of The Year Without a Santa Claus. It was cool to see that NBC was paying homage to this, a somewhat lost christmas classic at this day and age. However, the live action bit, just couldn't compare at all to this 1974 feature, from Rankin Bass... the kings of the stop animation Christmas classics. Year Without a Santa Claus, is perhaps the most underated of the dozens of specials Rankin Bass created throughout the sixties and seventies, but I gotta say, it is one of the best. It's too bad NBC didn't just play this one on TV. Its far more entertaining, and is guaranteed to get more laughs than the live action version...

All the characters are great, the dissillusioned Santa,.. his wife, the doctor, the two elves, Jingle and Jangle, Iggy, and of course those bumbling hams, the Heatmeiser and the Snowmeiser (Too Much!)Will Santa regain his Christmas spirit?, and will Southtown get that Christmas snow they've been dreaming of? Well, you just have to watch. This one was probably one of the last great Rankin Bass specials, its a littler more advanced then the bonafied hits like Rudolph, Frosty, and Santa Claus is Coming To Town. Much more a story for everyone to enjoy. Kids and adults.

The bonus features are the specialss that came out later, and are sort of weak compared but are ok. Like Rudolphs Shiny New Year, more for the kids, and are a little hokey.

Personally I have to wonder where that special is when the Leprechauns got together to throw an Irish Christmas. I liked that one better than Nestor the Long Eared Donkey. But Year Without A santa Claus should be the reason you purchase this disc. Good story, good music, good stuff.",1165881600,,1705,4.657807308970099
485523,5,6302503795,"When I was growing up in the 1980s before cable was widespread, I would occasionally catch a glimpse of these shows, as well as other ""animagic"" classics. Of all the Christmas shows I watched growing up, these had the greatest impact on my memory. When I went looking for them in the 1990s, I found many of them on video, but now that the DVD age is upon us, I am looking for them again.

This set contains three excellent, although somewhat lesser known, Rankin-Bass animagic classics.

The first show, ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" tells the story of when Santa decides to cancel his yearly Christmas trip, and nobody seems to care. Some of Santa's elves, along with Vixen the reindeer, take off to Southtown to find some Christmas cheer. If only it would snow at Christmas, the town would believe! This show features the well-known ""Heat Miser"" and ""Snow Miser,"" who battle for control of the weather. I have always enjoyed this one, especially the Miser brothers. I especially like the song ""I Believe in Santa Claus,"" which is a fine Christmas song in its own right. I wish someone would compile a ""best of"" Rankin-Bass CD.

The second show, ""Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey"" tells the story of a donkey with big ears who is kicked out of his original stable, only to wind up accompanying Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem (thanks to the help of an angel). It is short, but it is told beautifully. Rankin-Bass produced a few religious animagic shows, including this and the acclaimed (but sadly out-of-print) ""The Story of the First Christmas Snow."" They do a wonderful job of creating stories that are entertaining, but also reverent and respectful of the biblical stories.

The final show on the DVD is ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year."" It is the story of Happy, the New Year's Baby (the future Father Time) with big ears who runs away because he is constantly teased. If he doesn't make it back in time, the new year won't arrive! Rudolph joins the hunt to find the baby. This is the weakest of the three shows, in my opinion. While it is funny in many places and teaches a good lesson of accepting others, overall I find that this show just isn't as memorable as the others. However, it is still much better than most other holiday specials out there and worth owning.

Overall, these are three great animagic shows that teach basic values and always get me in the Christmas spirit. While some kids and adults may not understand the point of animagic, seeing as how we are now in the digital age, I find that the stories themselves are strong enough to draw people in and in turn allow them to appreciate the animagic. I just wish other similar shows would make it to DVD soon, especially ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus.""",1165795200,6,2738,4.613963039014374

485554,4,6302503795,"I love Nestor!!!! This is my 2nd favorite Christmas special of all time, and what a bonus, it comes with The year without a Santa Claus!!! But, let's begin with Nestor, He has some gigantic ears, and in the beginning not to many people (or animals) like him for that same reason. Actually, to tell you the truth, the first 15 minutes of this are quite mean and cruel. Not only do all the farm animals make fun of him but so does the farmer. Things actually begin to look up for Nestor around Christmas time as most of the animals apologize, but then the Roman guards intrude and that changes everything.

Seems the Roman empire have a need for some new donkeys and they take most of what the farmer has, including Nestor. But his ears fall down (they are cropped up) and the guard gets angry and takes all the farmers animals, for FREE!! So, obviously Mr. farmer is really ticked off and yells and screams at Nestor and throws (actually he launches him) Nestor outside in the cold and wind (where is the animal precint?) Well, mom is not to happy with this and runs away for the farm to find her son. She eventually does and he runs to hug her, but of course he trips over his ears....Ears Nestor.....Yes Momma!!!! she protects him from the cold and the wind, but very sadly dies during the night, so Nestor is on his own. Pretty dreary so far huh? Well, he meets a charabe (a rather fruity fairy) who tells him to keep his head up and he is destined for greatness, and then he is actually taken in by some more not so nice people and animals.

Joseph and Mary (with child) come looking for a donkey to carry her to Bethlehem, all they can afford is Nestor, and in a slight miracle, the caretaker has a change of heart and gives Nestor to Mary and Joseph for free, then wonders ""why did i do that?"" (God works in mysterious ways my friend) Anyway, in a beautifull scene with a tear-producing ending, Mary rides Nestor all the way to Bethlehem through a terrible wind and sandstorm. There, she gives birth and Nestor is the hero of the day. I have seen this thing over 30 times atleast, and I STILL get a tear in my eye everytime. I feel every person should watch this, and for this reason....Even if you are not religious like myself, watching this will definetely help you get some of that Christmas spirit alot of us sometimes lack, life gets most of us down, but this helps pick it up again, I promise.

The year without a Santa Claus is such a kick, just a whole lotta fun, with alot of great characters, and 2 that really stick out. You see, it seems Mr. Claus is not feeling so well, and that, along with his thinking that most kids just don't care anymore about Christmas, he decides to take a holiday. No Christmas, are you kidding me? well, Mrs. Claus does not like the idea either and sends two elfs (Jingle and Jangle, rather fitting don't ya think?) down ""there"" to find some Christmas spirit. Along the way, Mrs. C and the boys have a run-in with Snowmeiser, who loves  the winter and snow everywhere, and Heatmeiser, who loves, well, I'm sure you got the idea by now. They generally don't like each other but there mom, the big MN (mother nature) puts both of them in there place and helps to get Santa his holiday. Both Meiser's are priceless, each with there own song that you absolutely can't help but sing along with. Also quite hilarious when these two ""tough guys"" get chewed out by mom.

So, Santa gets his holiday, but during a very touching scene when he is reading a letter from a little girl saying how she is going to have a Blue Christmas without him, he realizes how wrong he was and Christmas is back on big time!!!

This really is a wonderfull story, and though not as good as Santa Claus is coming to town, it's still a classic and definite required viewing. We also get Rudolph's Shiny New Year. I loved the first Rudolph, but this is very weak, and rather dark and really not all that fun like the first two are. I'd just watch the first two and skip this one, your kids will thank you for it, Merry Christmas all, and rememeber.....Nestor Rulz!!!!!",1133913600,5,4082,4.35742444152431
485555,4,6302503795,"I love The Year Without A Santa Claus. This a fun movie that should be part of every families Christmas tradition. Mickey Rooney kills me as Santa in this one. His ""acting sick"" is hilarious, especially at the end when he's going from room to room moaning like a zombie. Wonderful movie, sure to bring a smile to your face.

Nestor The Long Eared Christmas Donkey breaks my heart every time I watch it. The way that poor little guy is treated makes me want to jump in and crush all who laugh at and pick on him. And when his mom reminds him of his ears from heaven is completely heartbreaking. Great little story and shares with us the true meaning of Christmas.

Rudolphs Shiny New Year - Love the original Rudolph, this one. Can't stand it!!! I hate that little ugly rugrat baby wandering around in his diaper which has to be full of dump and pi$$. He goos like an idiot,and forget about his ears, I would laugh more at his stupid Little Orphan Annie hairdo. Ion should have eaten him for breakfast. Would have given this a 5 if it weren't for this one.",1133913600,8,1055,4.3232323232323235
485556,5,6302503795,"Wow..What can I say? I grew up with this great Christmas show and even today,it still makes me feel good to watch it! I can't believe that some people are dissing it! I mean,what's to not like?? It's got great songs-great animation(even their fingers move!)and a happy ending for everyone! One reviewer went into alot of details and I'd like to answer it!
#1. Innocence does Not equal immaturity!
 2.""65% of the movie is made up of songs""..well..it's a Musical ! Hello?!
 3.""immature songs that are always happy, even in a dangerous situation""...Say what? It's a Kid's Christmas show! Did they expect ominous sad songs? And Dangerous situations?? Guess I missed em,cause,as far as I can see,the only ""dangerous"" part was Jingle and Jangle falling off for a few seconds of the reindeer,and no one was singing...and even then,they were caught right away! Did they mean when Mrs. Claus was talking to the Misers? Dangerous?  Where? They never menaced any of them-in fact they even sang and danced for them!
 4. Jingle and Jangle weren't clearly made out early on to be main characters? They should have Announced this??
 5. Characters are lacking ""development""..uhh..it's a CARTOON?? Not Gone With the Wind..
 6. Flip-flopping story..hmm..let's see...a kid that didn't believe in Santa Claus ""suddenly"" believes in him Right After he actually Meets him..yep that's weird. And Santa being sick and in bed getting motivated into trying to save his friends Right After he hears about the trouble they've gotten into...again...Verrrry weird....
 7. Butttt..now that ""gaping plothole"" ! Jingle and Jangle ride down on the tiniest most fragile young reindeer(""Vixen?? She's just a Baby.."")into a hot Southern town where she gets sick,but Santa rides down Dasher-a burly tough older veteran male reindeer and Dasher's okey for the short while that Santa is there. Hmm...guess I'm a ""fool to not notice this error""...probably for the simple reason that there Isnt any error...Big tough older male reindeer...tiny fragile young female reindeer...one gets sick-one doesnt! ! Amazing ! !
  For Pete's Sake,people! It's a Cartoon-made for Kid's! And one that everyone apparently Loves from all the reviews I've read here! Some people just try to think too much and like ruining things for others,I guess! It's got a full Five Star rating from almost 80 reviewers-only 1 or 2 seem to hate it! That's a little over 2% against to 97+% for !  There's a Real Easy solution to the problem! If you don't Like it-don't Watch it! But for the Rest of the world who already know what a great little cartoon this is-we'll just keep on watching it and Loving it each Christmas and so will our kids-for years and years to come! ! Santa is happy-Kids are happy-and the Miser brothers find out once again that they shouldn't mess with Mother Nature ! A Super Christmas Movie ! !",1133740800,15,2847,4.949685534591195
485557,5,6302503795,"I remembered only vague bits of TYWASC from 30 years ago, and being under ten years of age, the incomparable Miser Brothers left an impression on me that never really went away in three decades.  I remembered the songs, of course, no one who hears those could forget them, but I remembered being a little spooked by those two when I was a kid...they were just plain larger than life and maybe a little dangerous, too.  I just saw the flick the other night, and although the rest of the movie is sweet and cute, I was on pins and needles waiting for the peerless Snow Miser to make his appearance, and the King did NOT disappoint.  Both Miser brothers were far better than I remembered, with Snow Miser being a little more in love with himself than his brother and hands down my personal favorite.  The other songs in the movie were nice and heartfelt, although I admit it made the show drag ever so slightly for me.  The highlights were the Blue Christmas and I Believe In Santa Claus songs.  For children, I think this is one of the best Christmas shows ever made: there is danger, but it's understated, and the villains really aren't villains so much, just powerful fellas with powerful personalities.  The characters in danger are rescued and in the end safe and comforted, so even for small children I think the anxiety level would be minimal.  For adults it might get a little slow sometimes, but the Misers are worth the wait and repeat viewings later on.  The only regret I have is that this is the only appearance of the great and magnificent Snow Miser in the annals of entertainment.",1133568000,6,1593,4.522648083623693
485558,5,6302503795,"How does one explain Nostalgia to children who aren't old enough to have experienced anything yet to be nostalgic About? ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" was made in 1974. Today-a lofty and vast 30+ years later-those of us who grew up in that era know of it as being a more ""innocent"" and in many ways a more ""preferable"" time than to that of today. The harsh ""in-your-face"" crudities and street filth of the Modern Era and it's so-called ""new humour"" seem offensive and un-necessarily ""raw and intrusive"" to those of us that remember that earlier age. This little movie which so many of us recall fondly brings us back for just a tiny while to those more pleasant days and,no doubt,we will never tire of watching them-perhaps if only to ""feel"" the feather-like touch of that never to be seen again Past. It's not a Long movie and neither is it a deep and complex Plot. Indeed,in many ways,the youth of Today find it incomprehensible and can only sneer their derision to see their elder generation finding pleasure in something so ""silly"" and ""boring"". But,that isn't what ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" was supposed to be About. It wasn't ever intended to be a gripping epic of intense drama and accuracy-it was only a Cartoon. One to delight a young and innocent audience. The primary lesson or moral underlying the movie was simply that of ""Hang onto the Innocence of your Youth and don't lose your Sense of Wonder and Trust to the harshness of Age and growing up"",and is it so far off from that message even today-an almost inconceivable 3 decades later? Today's movies and television shows seem to have lost themselves to the stark bleakness of the street culture. It isn't ""cool"" to laugh at something that Isn't at the expense of another. The only humour we see in today's media Must include foul language,sexual situations and confrontational violence and drama or else it's ""boring"" and ""stupid"". If it doesn't Hurt or Insult someone,it's not Funny. And how sad is this? Even sadder,when one realizes that those doing the sneering and mocking will soon be in positions to begin making changes in the everyday lives of the population. Perhaps,from the state of today's Society,they have already Begun? One final musing...What will They look back fondly on 30 years from now?

485559,5,6302503795,"Surely, everyone knows how special these specials all were growing up, with the exception of Nestor, which certainly didn't get as much TV airing as the other two.  And I needn't go too much into each one.

The Year Without a Santa Claus has truly gained cult status, with it's quirky characters like the Heat Miser and Snow Miser.  In Rudolph's Shiny New Year, everyone always loved watching Rudolph save the ultra cute Baby Happy (Baby New Year), and they always seemed to air it on TV the day after Christmas in the 70's and 80's.  Nestor is a classic narrative of the Christmas Donkey with the long ears that is the least known and least replayed of the 3, but an excellent, heart warming, family tale.

Now, let me get to the best part!  The DVD quality is amazing!  I think Nestor is the sharpest of the 3, with Nestor nearly looking 3-D like you can touch him on screen.  You can see every hair fiber on the claymation figure!  They really did an incredible job with the DVD transfers of these 3 classic Rankin/Bass specials.

Don't even hesitate, this one has to be in everyone's holiday collection, and stop motion animation on DVD is visually stunning!  All 3 for one price, it's a no brainer!",1131494400,11,1203,4.497695852534562

The two real stars in this timeless classic are the Meiser brothers. Heat Meiser and Snow Meiser show off their talents for Mrs. Claus with unforgettable musical numbers.

485561,5,6302503795,"""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" has been my favorite Christmas movie since I was about 5 years old (I am now 35 years old, so that's a LONG time!!!).  Although it used to be played on t.v. each year, I noticed about 10 years ago that it was no longer shown, so I went out and bought a copy for myself - and I make sure to watch it each & every Holiday season.

This movie is done in the ""old"" animated fashion - with Mickey Rooney playing the voice of Santa Claus.  It is about a year where Santa Claus, believing that children just don't care about him anymore, decides that he's canceling his annual sleigh ride - so, of course, he won't be handing out gifts to anyone this year.

Of course, Mrs. Claus will have none of this, so she sets a plan in motion to show Santa just how much he's still loved - but there winds up being several glitches in this plan...

My favorite part is the ""fight"" between the heat & cold misers -I LOVE the song they sing (although I must say that I like ALL of the music on these old holiday movies).

The ending is wonderful & happy - as they all are.  I am trying not to say too much, as I don't want to ruin it for you if you've never seen it...  Suffice it to say that it's a great movie for children & adults alike.  For us adults, it will bring back many wonderful memories!",1121472000,10,1314,4.023076923076923
485572,5,6302503795,This DVD has a wonderful selection of holiday puppet animation. Most people have seen the Santa and Rudolph movies but are unfamiliar with the story of Nestor. This is my favorite Christmas movie. The story of Nestor is a charming Christmas story told from the point of view of an orphaned donkey that must journey to Bethlehem and with the guidance of a cherub learns his oversized ears have a very unique purpose. I highly recommend these shows for anyone who has the Christmas spirit.,1111968000,4,487,4.741176470588235
485573,5,6302503795,"On 'A Year Without Santa Claus' this is BY FAR the most surreal of the Rankin/Bass christmas specials. Santa tries to take a year off,resulting in Mrs. Claus trying to bargain with the Heat and Snow Mizar (two bizzare,showboating characters that more or less steal the show) and mother nature,they're mother. In 'Shiny New Year' Rudolph must locate the deserted Baby New Year named Happy from the 'archapelago of lost years' such as it is and from a bird-like foe called Eon. Trouble is Happy,like Rudolph is possessed of a non-conformity (in Happy's case Dumbo-like ears) that cause him to be laughed at by all he meets. Then upon finding Happy Rudolph explains how he is being laughed with,not at and a happy ending abounds. And Nester?Well that's just a very charming story in Rankin/Bass classic style. I always have saught them out-as I admire that clever animatronic style they use and the clever stories of various misfits finding themselfs at Christmas. These two are the most bizzare but even late in the day they still rock!!!!!",1103241600,8,1038,4.870056497175141
485574,5,6302503795,"I'm sure the other two cartoons on this DVD are good, but the only one I really care about is ""Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey.""  I remember watching this special on television each year when I was little, and I absolutely loved it.  The story is about Nestor, an adorable little donkey who was born with two ears as long as a pair of elephant trunks.  Poor Nestor has a hard time managing with those ears, and everyone makes fun of him.  When his mother gives her life to save him on a cold winter night (a scene that makes me cry harder than when Bambi's mother dies), he finds himself all alone in the world.  Soon Nestor meets a friendly little cherub who guides him on a quest that puts his ears to good use.  Nestor SINGLEHANDEDLY (or maybe singleEARdedly?) saves the Virgin Mary's life when she is carrying Baby Jesus to Bethlehem!  How cool is that?!  (I guess you have to see it to believe it, but trust me, it's quite entertaining!)

All religious undertones aside, this is still a great holiday classic that everyone will enjoy.  Nestor is irresistible, and I'm thrilled that I finally own the DVD and can watch it whenever I want.",1102982400,16,1150,4.485576923076923

I have always wanted to see this movie because it's part of the Rudolph and Frosty cartoon classics of Christmas and because I heard only great things about this movie and something about 2 guys named Snow and Heat Meiser. I really enjoyed the movie but I REALLY REALLY enjoyed the movie when Snow Meiser started to sing and dance and then Heat Meiser followed right after him. I had their songs in my head(which are the same exact song except the lyrics are changed to fit with each character)all the rest of the night and earlier this morning. I downloaded the songs and have been listening to them repeatedly! I love catchy songs and their songs take the cake! And they really steal the show! If it weren't for it being on TV I would have rewound the movie and watched them sing and dance repeatedly for the rest of the night and the rest of the Christmas season.

For some reason I have never watched ""Nestor The Long Eared Christmas Donkey"" during my years BUT I now plan to.  I just don't remember Nestor being one of those 8pm ""Special Presentation Movies"" in the late 70's and 80's.  OH, what a feeling listening to that Special Presentation build up music.

I love all the songs in the movie from the Heat Miser and Snow Miser songs to Blue Christmas although I absolutely love the I Believe in Santa Claus song and can't believe that someone hasn't recorded it on their Christmas CD.

The First is ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"", when Santa gets the blues over humans attitudes towards Christmas. Narrated by Mrs Claus, it includes as usual a great soundtrack and excellent characters.  Most fans loving the best, Heat Miser and Snow Miser. Jingle and Jangle, two of Santa's elves are pretty cute also.
The Second is ""Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey"", which I think is the most touching movie of the R/B collection.  It is a re-telling of the birth of Christ with a sweet twist. It brings tears every watching. If you haven't seen this, it is a must.  Wonderful inclusion on this DVD, especially if you want a break from the commercialism of Christmas.
And Thirdly ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"", which tells the story of time, our calender year.  Rudolph is asked to help Father time, when Baby New Year Dissapears.  This is a must have to keep your R/B appetite filled. When Christmas is over, and you have watched all your favourite R/B Christmas specials......oh no.......but wait, there's one more to keep you entertained!

485612,5,6302503795,"THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUSE is my absolute favorite Arthur Rankin Jr. & Jules Bass production. It has everything a Christmas story could want; action, story, suspense, villains, magical creatures and above all, music.
Written by William Keenan the story tells of the year that Santa got sick and could not do his legendary Christmas Eve ride. As a result Mrs. Santa Clause sets things in motion to make this right. You see, Santa believes no one cares about Christmas anymore. Mrs. Santa Clause will prove him wrong.
Told and song by the wonderful talents of Shirley Booth (Come Back Little Sheba, Hazel) she tries hard to convince Santa, voiced by Mickey Rooney (Lady And The Tramp II, The Fox and the Hound, The Black Stallion), to see that kids need him all over the world.
Who could forget the incredible talents of Dick Shawn (Captain Eo, The Producers) as the incredible arrogant and proud wizard of the chills Mr. Snow Miser. George S. Irving (Underdog, Tennessee Tuxedo) also incredibly voiced the not so even-tempered brother Mr. Heat Miser
This is a great story and a lot of fun for adults as well as kids. This one will make you smile without even noticing it. This little gem has clever writing and great songs throughout the whole piece. Buy this one too!
Also on this DVD are two other stories RUDOLF'S SHINNY NEW YEAR and NESTOR THE LONG EARED CHRISTMAS DONKEY. Both are attempts at the originals of trying to get quick stories and clever song s out but they lack the energy and creativity of The Year Without A Santa Clause and the every-popular Santa Clause Is Coming To Town.

Along the way, Santa, in search of them and Vixen, makes a family there believe in Santa again. Then, a deal is made with the bickering Miser brothers about if it can snow down south, and if it can have a spring day up north.

485616,5,6302503795,"What a difference that a DVD makes. The company that released this film has cleaned up the visuals and sound to look like it was filmed just yesterday. It is an eyepopping WOW! that can compete with any of the new computer generated films for visual. But the great colors, memorable songs, and nostalgia factor make this a better film. Actually there are 3 films on this DVD, making it well worth the purchase price. I had the feature story on VHS and I just can't get over the difference. Rankin & Bass always made great films for our generation in the 60's and 70's. Whether it was their stop-animation, or fully animated films, they are fun for all ages.

 I was born in 1963, before we had full time cable TV, satellite, VHS, cartoon network, etc. The Rankin/Bass studios made the best holiday specials. It was a time when kids and even whole families plopped down to the TV specials at Christmas and it was an EVENT! We only had kid shows on Saturday mornings back then, and you had to wait a whole year to see these great shows again. We are very lucky to be able to buy these now and to enjoy them without the tons of commercials. I remember rushing to get snacks or bathroom breaks during commercials too. Now my son is enthralled with these shows that have passed the 40 year test of time.

If you want to see more treasure by this great studio, search for films by Arthur Rankin, or Jules Bass. Some are animated, some are stop motion Animagic, some are traditional cel animation but they all have great story, design, and music. Not all have made the jump to DVD yet, but buy the ones that have so they will be encouraged to release more of their library. I highly recommend:
""Here Comes Peter Cottontail""; ""The Easter Bunny is Coming to Town""; ""The Hobbit""; ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" this DVD also has a rare treat ""Nestor the Long-Eared Donkey""; ""The Flight of Dragons"";  ""The Mad Monster Party"" (a 90 minute theatrical film); ""The Daydreamer""; ""The Wacky World of Mother Goose""; Little Drummer Boy Book 2""; ""The Emperor's New Clothes""; ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year""; ""Mouse on the Mayflower""; ""Twas the Night Before Christmas""; ""The Stingiest Man in Town""; ""The First Christmas""; ""Jack Frost""; and more all available at Amazon.com.

There are also 2 books sold here that I know of on this studio and their films, ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Making of The Rankin/Bass Holiday Classic"", and ""The Enchanted World of Rankin/Bass"".",1039737600,10,2453,4.629885057471264
485627,5,6302503795,"This is an outstanding release of three of the very best Christmas specials ever.
The Year Without A Santa Claus is an extraordinary work.  The plot is intriguing, the music is devine, and the voice actors are extraordinary.  Mickey Rooney and Shirley Booth are the quintessential Santa and Mrs. Claus.  Much has been written about the dynamic duo of Heat Miser and Snow Miser, but has anyone else noticed that Snow Miser bears a striking resemblance to James Woods and that Heat Miser looks just like John Goodman?  One of the lovliest songs ever written about Christmas is included in this special: ""I Believe In Santa Claus,"" sung touchingly by Mickey Rooney.  When the special first came out in the 70's I was just about at that age where I started to question Santa's existence, but after hearing Mr. Rooney sing that song, I believed once more.  ""I believe in Santa Claus, like I believe in love.  I believe in Santa Claus, and everything he does.  There's no question in my heart that he indeed exists.  Just like love, he's always there, waiting to be missed.""
""Rudolph's Shiny New Year,"" is a gem itself.  Red Skelton steals the show with his many voices, and the whimsical animation is charming.  How many of us wouldn't like to go back to the archipeligos of time and find our joy again?
""Nestor,"" is a three-hanky boo hoo, and absolutely wonderful.  It shares the message of the hope of the Christ Child without becoming a preachy mess.
You can't go wrong with this set of joyful entertainment.",1039132800,10,1506,4.684410646387833
485628,4,6302503795,"I love this movie! I remember watching this as a kid and thinking it was just so great. I watch it now and realize how cheesy it is but it really is so bad it's fabulous. The miser brothers are, of course, wonderful and what the flick is known for but you'll also love Mrs. Claus and the elves.",1037577600,,294,4.0
485629,4,6302503795,"Year without a Santa Claus is a good story with some catchy tunes.  The story has some memorable characters like Mother Nature and her two sons, the Heat and Snow Miser.  The voices are done very well and the music is great.
The Gem in this collection is Nestor the Long Eared Christmas Donkey.  This is a story about a misfit donkey who longs to find his place in the world.  Lo and behold he finds his niche and of course it is a very important one.  This story is about the true meaning of christmas.  Caution!  You will need a box of tissues to make it through this one.  This is a must have for all families.",1035504000,6,613,4.135593220338983
485630,5,6302503795,"For entertainment value for the kids (and those of us who are kids at heart), this DVD is TOUGH to beat.  Three classic Rankin-Bass stop-motion films together on one DVD.  A great testemonial to the DVD format.
The Year Without a Santa Claus is the ""main"" feature of the DVD.  If you've never seen it, you really owe it to yourself to check it out.  As others have stated, Heat Miser and Snow Miser have to be the highlight of this special.  Their songs are hilarious little vaudeville-type tunes, made all the more catchy by each brother's little army of ""Mini-Me""-like clones that perform the back-up vocals.  I think these bits are also the best of R-B's stop-motion, from a technical point of view.  The part where Snow Miser is spinning around in a blur, then suddenly you see his head stop and he sings out ""that's right!"", is VERY well done.  Of course, Snow Miser and Heat Miser are not the focus of the special, though they steal the show.  The basic plot is this - Santa has a cold, and he's tired and feelng worn out.  So, he decides to take a year off.  Well, Mrs. Claus won't have this, so she sends out the bumbling elves Jingle and Jangle, plus the reindeer Vixen, to find some Christmas spirit.  Naturally, they immediately get themselves in trouble, so first Mrs. Claus, then Santa himself, have to get involved in order to straighten the whole mess out.  While he's traveling incognito out in the world, Santa finds out that he IS appreciated after all.  Besides the Heat Miser and Snow Miser tunes, this special contains more great music, including the classic ""I'll have a blue Christmas Without You.""
Also here is Rudolph's Shiny New Year, another fond favorite of all of us who were kids in the '70s.  It's a little bit short in the music department, but overall very enjoyable.  Happy, the Baby New Year, is missing, and Father Time sends for help to his old buddy Santa Claus.  SC decides to send a search party, and who else is better equipped for a nighttime search that a flying red-nosed reindeer?  Rudolph joins forces with a large bunch of characters as he combs the Archipelago of Last Years to find the missing kid.  Complicating matters, the evil buzzard Eon is also trying to find Happy for reasons for his own, and he does NOT want Happy to make it home.
Finally, this DVD includes Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey.  This tale, set in Roman Empire-dominated Palestine, chronicles the adventures of Nestor of the long ears as he is thrown out of his home, loses his mother, and generally suffers through life until he meets his destiny helping a certain young couple on their way to Bethlehem.  A very moving and touching story, but I highly suggest you keep the supply of tissues handy, as this one is a real tear-jerker.
A great DVD with three holiday classics.  It's fun for both the thirty-somethings and today's kids.  Don't miss it!",1009670400,14,2878,4.6
485631,5,6302503795,"You might think that stories about Santa and Rudolph and Nestor the Donkey are just for kids.  Year Without a Santa Claus appeared on TV while I was in grad school, and my friends and I were immediately fans of it and watched it year after year as we tried to complete our Ph. D's.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it has a great cast, worthy of a Broadway hit, all of whom obviously took their work seriously.  Nothing shoddy here.  Lots of humor and cleverly written songs.  The Mini-Me version chorus lines of the Miser Brothers are hysterical.  The song ""Believe in Santa Claus"" may well bring a tear to your eye.  Ditto the other two entries on the disc. Red Skelton was well into his 60's when he starred in Rudolph's Shiny New Year, and his touching rendition of ""The Moving Finger Writes"", concerning the inexorable passage of time, was particularly poignant for me, who just turned 50 in 2001.

485633,4,6302503795,"For some reason, I didn't remember seeing TYWASC feature and was skeptical about all the reviews of how enjoyable the Snow vs Heat Miser songs were.  They were all correct,  those are catchy[...] songs!  I must have used the ""skip to a scene"" option 5 times just to rewatch it!  The sequences involving those two are wonderful!  For the record, I'm with those that prefer the Snow Miser just a tad more.  And since we are playing this game, I see John Lithgow as Snow Miser but not sure who would play his brother.  This episode is worth the price on its own.
RSNY I do remember seeing, and still enjoyed seeing it again.  With a unique cast of characters and some interesting ideas, it's worth a watch also, although the songs aren't that great.  But seeing Rudolph a part of the action in another episode is just plain fun.
NTLECD is ok.  It's a little too depressing for me despite the upbeat ending and I didn't find it as fun, but it's still very watchable.
Overall, the DVD package is really good as far as the films go, but it's all in standard versions with no extras at all.  Still, at this price, you might as well buy it and enjoy it.  BTW, does anyone remember the Rankin/Bass episode that featured the Norse mythology gods(I think)?  Or did I imagine that?  Sorry to post that hear, but I have no idea where a good place to pose that question would be.  Thanks, and happy holidays to anyone reading this :)",1008028800,2,1419,4.383141762452107

I remember seeing this around the time it first came out on TV and I've never stopped loving the music, the character and the stop-motion animation.  For pure nostalgia, this is a hard film to beat for those of us that grew up in the 70's.
The added bonus is that you get ""Nester the Long Eared Donkey"" and ""Rudolp's Shiny New Year"".  If you were to buy these individually on VHS, you'd spend well over the discount price offered here.

485666,5,6302503795,"""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" is one of the classic Rankin-Bass stop-motion animated holiday specials. In this installment, Santa Claus (voiced by Mickey Rooney), feeling poorly and convinced that people don't care about Christmas anymore, decides to cancel his annual sleigh ride around the world. Fortunately, Mrs. Claus (Shirley Booth) sets in motion a chain of events that restores Santa to his jolly self.
""Year"" is great fun from start to finish. The producers achieve a nearly perfect balance of musical numbers, fantasy, sentiment, and humor. Booth is outstanding as Mrs. Claus (who also narrates the tale). She gives a particularly spirited rendition of the fun song ""I Could Be Santa Claus"" (in which Mrs. C contemplates taking the reigns of Santa's sleigh on Christmas night). The vocal performances are excellently complemented by the whimsical stop-motion puppets and other superbly realized visual elements.
This film also introduces two of the most unforgettable characters of the Rankin-Bass mythos: Heat Miser and Snow Miser, the respective overseers of hot and cold weather phenomena. Each one is accompanied by his own chorus line of look-alike mini-Misers, and each gets his own outrageous theme song.
""Year"" has a subtle feminist twist, since Mrs. C is such a pivotal character, and also because Mother Nature emerges as perhaps the most powerful figure in the story. Religious fundamentalists will probably dislike the fact that this special seems to distance the Christmas holiday from its traditional religious implications (some may even see a touch of goddess-worshiping neo-Paganism in the character of Mother Nature). But for most audiences, I believe that this holiday special will be an entertaining delight.",994032000,68,1741,5.404411764705882

Forget his chilly brother, Heat Miser steals this entire program. I defy anyone- child or adult- to watch this without rewinding to see his song and dance number again. A must-have.",989539200,2,506,4.28125
485668,5,6302503795,"Funny, when I was in my teens and really becoming an animation ""connisseur"" (I'm a cartoonist and amateur animation historian) I thought very little of the Rankin-Bass product. The characters, at least in cel-animated work like ""Frosty"", tended to look bizarre (red circles on each cheek, which gave them a doll-like quality). Once the Fox Family Channel began re-running some of these old specials, though, I began to see them with new eyes. That's especially true of ""Year Without a Santa Claus"".
Mickey Rooney does a first rate job in his SECOND Rankin/Bass outing as Santa (for a while there, it seemed like he had a second career going as St. Nick) and like most people, I cannot miss the Heat Miser/Snow Miser production numbers. When my brothers were kids, they used to sing both those songs in an attempt to drive me crazy, but I'm the one who's singing along now. This is a must-see, and it's a definite improvement over the current crop of specials which seem determined to insert some PC message or other. Rankin/Bass' moralizing was mild at most--their main purpose was to tell a great story, and they succeeded beautifully here.",977356800,5,1141,4.826530612244898

485670,5,6302503795,"I grew up on the Rankin-Bass specials such as The Little Drummer Boy, Rudolph and The Year Without a Santa Claus. When I got to be in the 6th grade or so I thought I was too 'mature'(yeah, right) for them, but I still secretly watched TYWASC just to see the Snow Miser and the Heat Miser do their thing. One night when I was a teenager a bunch of us were sitting around flipping channels and landed on the Snow Miser about to start. You can imagine how it went after that, since we were all trying to act nonchalant and cool:
""oh MAN, this dumb special.""
""You want me to change it?""
""I don't care if you don't""
""OK, whatever, I guess we'll leave it."" By the time Heat Miser was halfway through his big number we all had big grins on our faces. The next time it was on I taped it and we watched it every year. At some point, the tape broke (probably from overuse), but a few years ago I finally tracked down a copy of the video. Now it's back in print!
The whole special is cool (can't beat that RB stop-motion) but we bought it just to see the Miser brothers do their thing. It's worth the price of admission even though they only have about 10 minutes of screen time.  This year we actually were going to give the whole movie a try, but lost patience after about 10 minutes (though kids might enjoy this more) and just cut to the chase and fast-forwarded to the Snow Miser. Usually when we dust off the copy every Christmas, my husband is the one hitting the rewind button after the big finish, ""TOO MUCH!""and sheepishly saying "" OK, uh, just one more time..."" Warning: you will NOT be able to get the song out of your head. Those are catchy-a$$ songs! You will walk around for days with, ""They call me Heat Miser, what ever I touch, starts to melt in my clutch..."" running through your head. To this day I have yet to meet one person who hasn't seen the special, loved the song, and in fact most of them know all the lyrics. You'll start singing it to yourself at work- ""he's Mr. White Christmas he's Mr. Snow""...and without fail you'll hear someone else, ""I'm Mr. Icicle, I'm MIS-ter Ten below...""
I agree with the other reviewers-they are crazy not to repackage the special prominently featuring the Miser bros, because it would fly off the shelves. At least put a little sticker with a picture of Heat Miser on the box or something, people will get the idea.
I'm also glad I'm not the only adult who has thought about who they would cast in a live-action version...we were thinking James Woods (who unfortunately looks more like Snow Miser every year) and--hey, as long as we're dreaming here anyway--Chris Farley. Anyway, if you watched the special as a kid, and are holding off on purchasing a copy because you think it won't stand the test of time, trust me on this- IT WILL! It's...too much (BA-da-da-da!).",976492800,11,2815,4.3619047619047615
485671,5,6302503795,"When Santa sends down two of his best elves to see if there's any Christmas Spirit left in the world, with the youngest reindeer Vixen. They get in a bit of trouble. Wether it's getting stuck in the middle of a battle between the Heat Mizer and the Cold Mizer, or getting poor Vixen locked in the pound. Needless to say they don't come back with the best news and Santa decides it's HIM who's going to take a holiday. Can Jingle, Jangle, Mrs. Claus and a little boy named Ignatius Thistlewhite save the day. Even if it means creating a truce between the biggest sibling rivalry in the history of time, the Heat Mizer and the Snow Mizer? Well I'm not going to give the ending away!
I feel in love with this movie when I was about 5, now that I'm 15 I still love to watch it every year it comes on. I have all the words to the songs memozied and am delighted that I can actually buy a coppy of this. I'll be sure to order one ASAP. I reccomend this video to anyone who loves Christmas specials and never gets to old for them.",975801600,2,1023,4.12
485672,5,6302503795,"Growing up in the '70s, I was enthralled by the Christmas specials of Rankin and Bass (Rudolph, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, Drummer Boy, Twas the Night Before Christmas ['80s]). But ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" was my favorite stop-motion show. I LOVED the Snow Meiser and I still sing both the Snow Meiser and the Heat Meiser's songs each year.
Thanks to the reviewer who recommened the CD of music that has the Snow Meiser and Heat Meiser songs on it.",975628800,5,460,4.488095238095238
485673,5,6302503795,"Plenty of other folks have gushed (properly so) about the nostalgic content of ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" (hereinafter ""TYWSC"") so I'll concentrate on the technical quality of the DVD release:
The picture on this disc is unbelievably bright and sharp -- undoubtedly worlds better than it looked when we all watched the original CBS transmission in 1974. It makes me wonder if they did any digital processing and cleaning up of the original print. I really enjoyed the ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" DVD release earlier this year, but the picture quality on TYWSC is far superior both in terms of clarity and vividness, and the animation and set design are also more detailed and elaborate than in ""Rudolph.""  While not of Nick Park caliber, perhaps, the stop-motion animation is more than adequate: Both our 7- and 3-year old were transfixed throughout the whole show. You will be surprised by how great the picture looks.  The original mono soundtrack is well balanced, with no audible hiss; both the characters' speech and the (many) musical numbers come through very clearly.
The ""extras"" include two additional Rankin-Bass holiday specials, making this disc a triple feature and a great value.  They include ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" and ""Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey.""  Both are of similarly high technical quality. Notwithstanding its goofy name and lower profile in the Rankin-Bass pantheon, ""Nestor"" is a half hour, animal-based gem that gives a welcome nod to the religious underpinnings of the Christmas holiday.
Whether for nostalgia value or your own youngsters, this DVD is a fine purchase.",973123200,114,1623,5.183206106870229

This classic Rankin/Bass animated tale surrounds the story of a Christmas that almost wasn't. The jokes are corny but the short, silly vaudeville sequence of the Heat Mizer and the Snow Mizer dancing and singing has made this feature a cherished classic for both children and generations of adults.
(I'm waiting for a live action Hollywood remake of this one with Jack Nicholson cast as the Snow Mizer and Danny Devito as Heat Mizer)",973036800,,696,4.857142857142857
485675,5,6302503795,"In this video, Santa Claus wants to skip his job because he feels unappreciated.  Mrs. Claus tries to take his place, but everyone knows it's her and not Santa.  Mrs. Claus sends two elves to a nearby town to try and find someone who still appreciates Santa, but the elves can't find anyone.  Meanwhile, the elves lose the reindeer that they rode on to get to the town and Santa has to come and rescue the reindeer.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Claus finds out that if the town gets some snow once in a while, they might start to believe in Santa Claus more, so Mrs. Claus decides to go see Freeze Miser, a guy who controls the north winds and creates snow and all forms of snow.  Freeze Miser likes Mrs. Claus a lot because her husband, Santa is usually associated with snow, and everyone likes Santa, so most people like it when Freeze Miser makes snow in their town.  As Freeze Miser said, ""He's(""he"" being Santa)the best advertisement I've had in years!""  Anyway, Freeze Miser likes Mrs. Claus, so he's happy to do anything for her.  However, the town where Mrs. Claus wants snow is in Heat Miser's territory, and Heat Miser won't let his brother Freeze Miser put snow in any of his territories, so Mrs. Claus has to go and see Heat Miser and ask if he'll let it snow in one of his territories, but Heat Miser wants the North Pole in return for his cooperation, so Mrs. Claus goes to Mother Nature, the mother of Freeze Miser and Heat Miser, and Mother Nature makes them cooperate.  In the end, Santa Claus gets an official holiday and children send him presents on Christmas morning.  I guess it was sort of a way of saying ""Thank you"" to Santa.  However, Santa realizes that his job is just too important to skip.  In short, buy this video!",971568000,3,1734,4.418238993710692

I immediately snapped this up when I saw it in a video store, and it's become a treasured holiday favorite.  It's a fairly typical Rankin/Bass production in some ways (some of the songs are REALLY treacly), but the storyline is cute and Vixen, the baby reindeer, is adorable.  However, this film will always stand out for the world-famous Miser Brothers, who sing possibly the catchiest song ever created in a Christmas special and have inspired many the eggnog-fueled singalong!

485697,5,6302503795,"""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" is a true Christmas classic from the masters of ""Animagic."" Mickey Rooney reprises his role from ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"" voicing a tired ol' Kris Kringle who decides to take a year off.  Well, Mrs. Claus (Shirley Booth) won't have that and sends two enterprising elves, Jingle and Jangle, out to find some Christmas Spirit.
As everybody knows, the true show stealers in this perennial favorite are Mr. Heat Miser and Mr. Cold Miser, Mother Nature's feuding sons.  They sing the best songs (""I'm mister Green Christmas, I'm Mr. Sun, I'm Mr. Heat Blister, I'm Mister Hundred and One."" ""I'm Mister White Christmas, I'm Mister Snow, I'm Mister Icicle, I'm Mister Ten Below."") and they have the best lines.  They also have a chorus of little copies of themselves to sing along.  This one reigns as my favorite Rankin/Bass Christmas special.  Also features the classic tune ""I'll have a blue Christmas without you.""
And let's not forget what else is on this DVD!  ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" features the adventures of Happy the New Year's baby (""those ears!"") as he journeys through the Archipelago of Last Years.  Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer follows in hot pursuit accompanied by Big Ben the Whale, the knight Sir 1023, the caveman 1 Million B.C., and 1776 (looking like Benjamin Franklin).  ""Nestor the Long Eared Donkey"" is inspired by a  Gene Autrey song, and tells the tale of a donkey with VERY long ears, who is turned out by everyone.  He finally finds his destiny with a man and his pregnant wife on their way to Bethlehem.",969580800,21,1570,4.760147601476015
485698,5,6302503795,"This is the weirdest christmas special I have ever seen...yet it does what all great christmas specials do, it puts me in a festive mood. I love the  stop-motion animation using ""real"" textures (I call it  Feltmation), it lends a warmth to the picture that other forms of animation  (cgi, Claymation) cannot equal.
""The Year Without a Santa  Claus"" is by far the most surreal children's christmas special, but it  is still very suitable for children...the weirdness just makes it more fun  for the adults.  The intro productions for Heat and Snow Miser rival  Elizabeth Taylor's entrance into Rome in ""Cleopatra"" in terms of  utter ridiculousness. Completely unnecessary, but hilarious.
It's a  must-see, if not own!
The show also has a nice touching ending--Santa  receives a bunch of caring messages and gifts from children around the  world and he realizes how much he is loved.",967334400,8,881,5.0
485699,5,6302503795,"This is one of the classic holiday television stories from my childhood (I am now 33).  Probably the most memorable part of this particular story  (Santa decides to take a vacation) is the Heat Miser/Snow Miser song.  Anyone who grew up during the seventies will gleefully remember the  animated puppet productions by Rankin/Bass about Frosty and Rudolf and, of  course, Santa Claus.  However, enjoyment of these stories is not limited to  the thirty-something crowd.  Last year, when ""Rudolf, the Red-Nosed  Reindeer"" came out on DVD, I purchased it to savour and reminisce with  my friends.  To my surprise, my nephews and niece (ages 3, 5, and 7) LOVED  it.

The story involves Santa Claus catching the flu right before Christmas, and thinking that no one cares about him or the holiday anymore.  Two elves decide to take a baby Vixen (one of Santa's reindeer, of course) to talk with people to try to prove that Santa is wrong about his perceptions and to convince him to continue with his work.  Needless to say, things do not go as planned resulting in Mrs. Claus having to come and get the elves who have gotten themselves and Vixen into trouble.

She decides to make a visit to the two notorious brothers who control all of the weather to see if the Snow Mizer would agree to let is snow in the South for just one day (a condition that the Mayor has set in order to let Vixen go - she is trapped in the Dog pound, mistaken for a dog).  He agrees only if she can get his brother - the Heat Mizer - to let it be warm in the North Pole for one day.  Of course, he doesn't agree to this and Mrs. Claus is forced to escalate to their mother - none other than Mother Nature herself!

Great songs in this show, and a good story (even if the elves are more than annoying).  The Mizer brothers are the key to making this show one of my holiday favorites.",942969600,7,1398,4.129151291512915
