6604947,5,B00MZ3X3UE,"The oblivious Ichika is back along with Houki, Cecilia, Rin, Charlotte and Laura who are all still vying for his attention and affection. Ichika had learned in season one that there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide  when you're surrounded by highly competitive boy crazed combat ready mechanized exoskeleton pilots.

In season two his already complicated and hazardous life goes into overdrive with the addition of new girls and the emergence of advisories hell bent on achieving their goals. While the hilarious harem comedy and thrilling mech action are more than enough to make this season worth watching it was the intriguing and mystifying revelations that made this season a must buy and left me eager for a third season.

The biggest change from season one to season two is the switch from computer generated to hand drawn animation for the mech battle sequences. While the first season's computer generated battle sequences were great I found the second season's more traditional animation style an excellent improvement.

The animation is gorgeous, the characters are compelling, the story is intriguing and the English dub is excellent making this series a must own for any anime fan and one of my favorite animes!

Be warned this anime contains fan service so it may not be suitable for children! Fan service involves bouncing breasts, skimpy bikinis, revealing clothing, glimpses of panties, brief nudity, sexual innuendos and suggestive themes.",1416096000,12,1462,5.177966101694915

6604950,4,B00MZ3X3UE,"Poor Ichitka - just when he thought he was getting used to not only being the only male IS pilot and dealing with the competition of his lady friends (mostly oblivious, much to their dismay and anger), new things begin showing up.  The student council president has taken a personal interest in our hero, there are people out to kill him and steal his unit, and then there is the upcoming team battle in which he is trying to get the younger sister of the president to be his partner.  Can he survive his second semester of school, or will his end come from food poisoning - or the woman who says she has a vendetta against him and his sister?

Watched this on Crunchyroll and it follows the same formula of season one.  Itchitka is mostly clueless about the feelings of all the girls in his life (though he starts to come around near the end of this season), but the action and drama are taken up a notch.  My favorite girls are the president and Laura - one is forward with her affections, the other is just as forward, but gets so flustered when she thinks about our hero.  If you enjoyed the first season, you should enjoy this while we wait for season three to come around.",1409097600,12,1178,4.331818181818182

6604953,5,B00MZ3X3UE,"- Synopsis: A sequel to the first season. This anime shows the whacky adventures of one lucky guy or unlucky to some, in a training academy full of women. Because for story reasons, and harem reasons, women are typically the only ones who can pilot their mechas. Due to this, being the only guy who can pilot a mecha immediately makes him the center of attention. The rest of the story involves the daily interactions between the main character and the other students, as well as the occasional enemy appearing with unknown motives.

===========================================================================================================

- Analysis: If you were looking for a strong, confident, non-hesistant main character; you will have to look elsewhere. The main character of the show is fairly weak compared to the other pilots. Not only that, he isn't the smartest person out there, either. But his unique circumstances and kind-hearted personality helps win over the other female students without much effort. Furthermore, the main character is plain and common. He exhibits traits that are common in many anime characters that have harems.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. It's a 3 DVD set and includes 12 episodes for a total of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence and moderate fan-service.

- Conclusion: The main character is your standard character you will find in many other harems. The girls are cute, the mechas are unique and interesting and may be more appealing to those that do not care much for the traditional, bulky robots. These are more compact mechas. The fan-service is moderate and the scenes have plenty of comic-relief. The overall tone is light-hearted with some serious events as the situations call for it.

6604960,4,B00MZ3X3UE,"Synopsis:
The gang is back, summer break is over and the second semester of school in starting up. The girls are still flirting, and fighting for affection from the clueless Itchika... the lone male I.S. pilot trainee, and while not much has changed, this semester may prove to be more dangerous for the gang. A new threat to the safety of the school and it's students, comes in the form of a secret organization, Phantom Task, bent on stealing all the I.S. units with unique capabilities. Also, there is a new romantic rival for Houki, Lingyin (Rin), Charlotte, Laura, and Cecilia, in the Student council president, Tatenashi Sarashiki and her younger sister Kanzashi.

While this season was not as good as I had hoped, it was still worth watching. It used the same basic formula as season 1, and possessed a good bit of action, comedy, and some unique elements that helped set it apart from other 2nd season anime's that I have watched. The only truly annoying thing I found with season 2 is the same pet peeve I have with most anime in the harem genre. The lack of commitment to a particular character of the opposite sex gets old after a while. After all, Itchika almost kissed Houki at the end of season 1 and now Itchika has returned as the clueless male. Not that I was rooting for Houki specifically, in fact I was rooting for Charlotte in that she seemed the most genuine, loyal, and suited for Itchika..... but, as for him.....nobody can be that oblivious, or ignorant to the feelings of those around him. This just detracted from the series for me on a most basic level. And while I get the reason behind keeping him in this state, they could commit him to a relationship and still keep the harem style of all the others trying to steal him away. If there is a season 3 in the future, I hope this plot hole gets filled. That being said, I did enjoy this season and look forward to a season 3.",1457049600,,1903,4.468390804597701

6604973,3,B00MZ3X3UE,"Let me say first and foremost, I love this series. That being said, this season has problems that a viewer could give a pass to in season one because it was new. Ichika returns as the clueless typical Japanese Anime male ""hero"". The problem is that his character type has been done to death in a hundred other anime. As I watched season 2, I found his character to be more and more grating and annoying. The rest of the cast is ok. I love Charlotte, I admit, and while I may not adore the entire cast, they are different enough to be enjoyable to watch on the screen. The problem is the lack of character development among the main cast returning from season 1. Ichika doesn't change at all. His reaction to the harem anime in which he is the center of simply isn't funny anymore. The viewer gets to see some fresh blood in a pair of sisters who join our happy band of awesome mech pilots, and they are also very fun to get to know episode to episode. The animation is amazing, the mech battles are fantastic. The plot is a mess. For every episode or piece of an episode we are given with plot development, we are then subjected to one or two episodes of pure fan service that do NOTHING for the overall story and serve only to show how painfully un-hilarious Ichika is with his clueless personality towards the other girls, as well as his not so covert admiration (obsession?) with his older sister.  Do not get me wrong, I like fanservice, I just don't want to drown in it.  I do hope there is as season 3, but if so, I hope they stick closer to the light novels and the intriguing plot and not so much on the girls wooing the clueless Ichika who really isn't that great of a mech pilot to begin with.",1437523200,,1703,4.253086419753086

6604976,4,B00MZ3X3UE,"A situation I've never come across in Australia - a lone boy at school filled with hundreds of girls who definitely consider him a 'bit of alright', and determine to get their share - exclusive to everyone else.  Would we have reacted by pushing him down a flight of stairs - or by getting extra keys cut to his dorm room door and selling them to the highest female bidders?  A 5-strong harem at the end of the first series gathers pace and grows to a 7-strong gaggle, with situations egged on by the school student president, a strong-willed girl who seems to be having far too much fun doing so.  It can also turn serious, as an unexpected family plot materializes out of left field, but hilarity can break out at any time and frequently does.  A welcome follow-up to the first series, and some key material available to provide a starting point for a third series if the producers so desire.

6604984,3,B00MZ3X3UE,"Coming off of the first season of the show, I was eagerly awaiting the second season and looking forward to seeing what type of situations that Ichika would get caught up in. I felt that the first few episodes of the second season were good, but things just fell apart afterwards. It seems like the studio just decided to focus on fanservice (not that I mind it), but the latter episodes were a pain to watch and did not do anything to advance the plot. That said, it's still the show that most of us came to love in the first season, just with a few new additions to Ichika's harem.",1426464000,,583,4.261261261261262

6604986,3,B00MZ3X3UE,"I'm giving this 3 stars because of the art & fight scenes, I thought they were really good. The storyline however was the same lame story you see in just about every harem anime out there. You have a group of girls, one of them is always a childhood friend, who all like the same guy. The entire span of the series, these girls all on different occasions try to get the affections of the lone male character which is fine. Problem is that the male character in these types of anime's are always clueless idiots who show more attention to other males on the show than the females. As I watched this show, I started to think c'mon, no one is that dumb, how can this dude not know these girls all want to get with him. You would think with this being the 2nd season, that some type of romance between him & maybe his childhood friend would blossom but it never doe's. Add to the fact that everytime the guy actually doe's say something to one of the girls that may slightly be affectionate, they kick his butt. These are supposedly High School age kids & yet like sooo many other of the same type of anime's they're completely immature about relationships. If you saw the first season then you already know all this. Nothing really changes in this season, just more of the girls chasing the idiot & casually being interrupted by attacks from some agency called Phantom Task. The other problem I have with this series is that even though this is a school full of IS operators, the only individuals we ever see fighting in the mech suits are the main characters. The main male character's sibling side story never gets resolved, I'm wondering if there's going to be a third season where all of this is explained. If your a fan of fanservice, there's not really a whole lot in this series only a few scenes here & there. The ova for the second season actually had more fanservice than the entire 2 seasons so far...",1424908800,,1909,4.410764872521247

6604994,5,B00MZ3X3UE,"I love the IS series. It's a really good blend of action, comedy, and harem. It's also one of the few animes that I prefer to watch dubbed because of the added emphasis on the accents of the main characters (as a native English speaker, I obviously don't notice much in the Japanese accents). Season two adds a few new love interests and starts to structure a real story. It's a great show to sit down and have a good time with and not take too seriously. That being said, this specific DVD bundle is kind of disappointing. First, it's a dvd and not blu ray. Second, it doesn't come with a soundtrack like the first season did (I believe it's because it's published by someone else this time around). And finally, because it wasn't release yet so it's absolutely not the fault of this product, it doesn't include the World Purge OVA. If these sound very nitpicky, it's because it is. It's a great series that, while in a downgraded visual quality because of it's DVD format, is still great to go through. I'll definitely pick it up again if they decide to release it again on blu-ray or with the OVA.",1421366400,,1100,4.4236453201970445
6604995,1,B00MZ3X3UE,"Now first off I should preface this review by saying that I have actually read all of the Japanese Light Novels that this anime is adapted from. Key word there, ""Adapted"" as in an imperfect imitation of a superior product. A factor also worth mentioning in advance is that the novels and this series is colored by Japan's current dislike for the United States and xenophobia/racism towards other nations and ethnicities in general, as well as a heavy dose of ethnocentrism. The light novels are definitely worth reading and maintain a consistent plot that gradually reveals the series' secrets. Now let's clear some other things up. The first anime basically covers all the events of the first 3 novels with each episode corresponding to a chapter in the books. It also follows the novels with relatively good accuracy and only really leaves out a few of the side characters, the Gotanda siblings and the pilot of the Silver Gospel, Natasha Fairs. Now the end of the first anime sends up a huge red flag that the anime is going to go way down hill simply with the absence of Natasha and the claim that the Silver Gospel is completely automated. While not a huge change at first glance, this opens up a significant plot hole later on when compared to the light novels.

Now this sequel to the first anime basically tries to cover all of the events in the light novels that occur from the 4th volume to the as yet unpublished 9th volume when the anime was in production. Basically they try to cover twice as many books using the same amount of episodes, the end result is an abominably stupid farking disaster. Now about half of this show follows some of the events in the light novels while the other half is whatever brain vomit the writers and producers could think to pull out of their rear sphincter to try and compensate for throwing away 75% of the plot for the sake of money and fan service. Now IMO I think the reason that this anime turned out so bad is a mixture of a spat that the series creator had with both his/her publishers and the producers of the anime as well as the current dislike of the USA leading to certain components of the novel being ignored and/or left out. This resulted in a mad attempt by the anime producers to squeeze as much money out of the series as possible before they possibly lost all rights to it, while simultaneously using it as an opportunity to screw over both the publishers and the series' creator by ruining it's popularity. Essentially this anime is a product of Japanese corporate politics at it's best.

Now assuming that a person watches anime with the hopes of enjoying a decent story then I think it's safe to say that this one sucks terribly. However if you're the type that only watches for fanservice then you'll probably like this no matter what",1421280000,2,2803,4.570576540755467

6604998,2,B00MZ3X3UE,"Maybe you shouldn't watch too many harem comedies in short time, because you become annoyed with how ridiculous the characters are.  Infinite Stratos 2 picks up with the 5 girls from the first season still obsessing over whether Ichika notices them, likes them, likes their cooking, whatever.  They alternate between mooning over him and beating the crap out of him if he actually appears to be checking them out or might possibly be interested in some outside girl. Psycho and Schizo, what a charming combination!  We add in a new girl who is the student council president and her mousy younger sister.  Fortunately they don't become full-fledged members of the ""obsessed with Ichika"" club although the little sister does kinda, sorta admit that she might like him a little.  Jeez.  The harem action is occasionally interrupted with a random fight to the death with some mystery organization named Phantom Task.  Repeat all this a few times, toss in a final battle scene, and there you have it.  Nothing gets resolved. Nothing gets explained. Ichika never figures out that the girls who constantly want to spend time with him and are always bringing him lunch because ""they made too much"" actually like him.

I also did not however expect the plot to get totally jerky snapping in and out of school life and back and forth through time and it was just too busy to me. I felt tons of potential was wasted on this show. The acting as well as the characters are strong, so it is just so disappointing to see it miss like this.
