8511504,1,B000SMQPZE,"This sounded like a great product, but the instruction isn't easy to follow. She just blows through each pose, tells you ""do this 5 times"" and moves on to the next pose.

If you play golf with this same hurry-up pace you've completely missed the point of yoga and golf. I've ordered another yoga/golfer  DVD from this same instructor, Im hoping its not the same style and pace.",1364083200,,377,4.529411764705882
