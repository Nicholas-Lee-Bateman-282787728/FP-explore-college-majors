SYNOPSES for ""Horror Classics V.10""--

KING OF THE ZOMBIES--  A plane crashes on an island and its passengers take refuge at a mansion that may be inhabited by ghosts and zombies. Released in 1941, this film has a WWII subplot. Director Jean Yarbrough is best remembered for heading up several of Abbott & Costello's features, plus their TV show.

LADY FRANKENSTEIN--  After his demise, the infamous doctor's daughter continues his experiments. She hopes to transplant the brain of her aging lover/assistant into the body of a powerfully-built but mentally challenged servant. Musclebound Mickey Hargitay (Jayne Mansfield's ex) has a small part as ""Captain Harris.""

THE MONSTER MAKER--  Nicely atmospheric story of a mad scientist who innoculates his enemies with a fast-acting virus that deforms their bodies. For a victimized concert pianist, the antidote may be bought for lots of money... PLUS his beautiful daughter. Ray 'Crash' Corrigan appears in one of his uncredited man-in-the-monkey-suit parts.

SISTERS OF DEATH--  A Russian Roulette sorority initiation causes the death of a pledge. Years later, the other girls are invited to a reunion, but they aren't aware their host is the dead girl's whacked out father.
