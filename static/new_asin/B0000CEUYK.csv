8312052,1,B0000CEUYK,This is about the worst I ever saw. The hand putting wood on the fire or poking at the fire seems low budget at an inflated price. Even the picture is fuzzy and not clear. If I could I would send it back. It is not worth the money I paid.,1075248000,18,238,3.6862745098039214
8312053,1,B0000CEUYK,"This DVD is a bootleg.  First off, you have to have a DVD player that plays CD-R's, tipping you off that it is recorded on cheap stock.  That should have been my first tip-off not to open this horrible waste of $30.  I bought this because it had Christmas music, and I figured I could wire it through my surround sound and fill my home with the hollowed tunes of Christmas during my annual Christmas party.  First off, the picture quality is no better than a home movie and the sound wasn't recorded in 5.1 or 2 channel sound.  The sound is terrible, so don't worry about the great Christmas music feature.  To add the icing to the fruitcake, there is actually a point in time, where you see a hand put more wood on this ""Crackling Fireplace.""  If I had to do this all over again, I might pay the 3.97 for this DVD that I paid for S/H.  I hope this helps others, do not get scammed like I did.",1071446400,24,893,4.151162790697675
