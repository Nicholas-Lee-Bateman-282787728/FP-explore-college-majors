8535931,4,B0094GMT0A,"A brand-new volume of the insane series ""Almost Naked Animals"" is here.  Join Howie, Octo, Piggy, Bunny, Narwhal, Sloth, and Duck as they have the craziest of adventures that go on inside the Banana Cabana hotel.  In fact, there are six of them on this DVD:

""Narwhal's Contest"" - An obsessed fan wins a day to spend with her singing idol Narwhal, but then she gets fascinated by Howie and his love of stunts prompting jealousy in Narwhal and Sloth !
""Robo Howie"" - In an attempt to take over the Banana Cabana, Poodle builds a robotic version of her brother Howie.  Only a stunt attempt will prove who's the real Howie and who's the one that's firing the others.
""Ear Wax Elf"" - Howie pulls out a wad of ear wax in hopes of the Ear Wax Elf leaving gifts in exchange.  But his friends don't seem to believe Howie.
""Cool Paw Howie"" - Howie decides to turn his hotel into a prison.  Unfortunately, his annoying new prisoners don't want to escape.
""Piggy Party"" - Howie decides to throw a surprise ""Mud Day"" party for Piggy, but keeping it a surprise from the ninjitsu chef is gonna be a challenge.
""The Sun Howie Always Wanted"" - When the sun isn't shining down on the Cabana, Howie and Duck decide to build an artificial sun that actually works.  Problem is, how do you turn it off ?

That's it for this volume, but I hear there's gonna be some new episodes of ""Almost Naked Animals"" coming soon to Cartoon Network, so stay tuned !",1366416000,,1430,4.390151515151516
