You do not have to be very religious to enjoy this, which it is where the greatness in the songs lie. It makes you want to sing to Jesus even if you never knew you wanted to do that! A must for girls and boys that love more mainstream preteen bands. THIS BAND WILL RIVAL ANYTHING OUT THERE TODAY.",1188345600,,416,4.148148148148148
2551993,5,B000F5DSUE,"We have the first Hillsong worship DVD for kids and have loved that one for a few years now.  I was a little hesitant that this would not be as good, but I was wrong.  I love this DVD and love that they incorporate the salvation message as well as scripture throughout the DVD.  My kids dance through most of it and worship at the same time.  I love this kind of influence on my kids!",1187308800,,384,4.0131578947368425
2551994,5,B000F5DSUE,"Love it - my daughter loves it! As soon as it comes on she light up and then starts to dance. She is only 11 months old but boy does she know how to get down. We have other DVDs but this one is her favorite! Thanks Hillsong for the great job - I wish more Churches had kids programs like yours! I myself even find this DVD very good and lots of her DVDs I can't stand to watch but this one I can.

All are good but the 2nd DVD in their collection is the best!",1175299200,4,459,3.683673469387755
2551995,5,B000F5DSUE,"This DVD is perfect to connect your kids to God. It is full of fresh worship with music that kids love.

My 6, 5 and 1 year old, all of them love it,  and jump and dance and lift their hand to worship a Super Strong God.

With the many features of this DVD you can choose different backgrounds, or how to learn the hand motions to the song, with subtitles or without subtitles, a whole DVD full of fun.",1171324800,2,402,4.0

8117622,2,B000F5DSUE,"We have Hillsongs ""Tell the World"" and kids and adults alike all love it!
So we waited in eager anticipation for this DVD to arrive from Amazon. However when it arrived we couldn't contain our disappointment. None of us really like this DVD. Our 3 year old boy who dances away to Tell the World was not impressed. Our 9 and 11 year old girls who also like Tell the World walked out of the room due to lack of interest.",1335139200,,418,4.172839506172839
