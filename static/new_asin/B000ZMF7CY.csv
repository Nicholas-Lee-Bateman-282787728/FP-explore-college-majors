8424650,5,B000ZMF7CY,great dvd a must for any haunter.  rich hanf details how to set up a great haunted attraction and how to give people a good scare.  Many ideas seem simple but they really work.  he is over the top when he does his saleman bit but his stuff works. i have used the ideas here and have seen the results. I liked this dvd so well that i bought the other dvds he has created.  this disk is not a prop makers how to but a haunted house how to complete with behind this scene footage of how the audence reacts to the scares.,1241913600,3,517,3.9423076923076925
8424651,1,B000ZMF7CY,"This is a rip off. This is a DVD that does nothing but advertise their haunted house. The DVD shows one thing over and over. How to jump out from behind a curtain or a fake panel and go boo. Over 100 minutes of this. It does not show how to make any props. It does not show how to do any makeup. It does have about 20 minutes of news clips about how great thier haunted house. I am not taking anything away from thier haunted house. It looked pretty good. But this was suppose to be a How-to DVD. And the How-to it showed was how to jump out from behind a curtain.

Skip it.",1199491200,3,574,3.905982905982906
