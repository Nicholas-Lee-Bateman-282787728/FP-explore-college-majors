Camera work also did not zero in on brushes to see some identifying brand or crimp. And Mr. Reid does not always stop and make
strong emphatic points...he just drifts along in mumble-tone. Do not get me wrong...it's the program DIRECTOR that is at fault b/c
 CReid is an excellent ""explainer""..just check out his books! Glad  I saw this before buying it.",1519776000,,483,4.540229885057471

8397371,1,B003IGZZS0,The book is so fabulous so I was expecting the same from the DVD.  Instead it is a critic of other peoples artwork and how to improve.  That may be helpful for others but it was not for me and I was so disappointed it was not like the book AT ALL.  It should have been given a different name from the book.  Charles Reid is still my idol in watercolors and I love all his work and own ALL his books and DVDs.,1426032000,,408,3.8214285714285716
8397372,5,B003IGZZS0,"I have decided that after buying and studying many books on watercolor, that Charles Reid is unbeatable.  But, it takes a lot of art appreciation to realize his remarkable style.  Many years ago I have to admit that I did not appreciate his apparant casualness, yes even sloppiness.  Now I realize that all those spatters, drips are deliberate, planned and executed with such skill that the viewer is fooled into thinking all of his work is done easily and without strategy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  He is working hard, thinking, making mistakes, fixing mistakes all the time.  If I could paint like anyone I would like to paint like Charles Reid.  It will never happen.  I own many of Charles Reids demonstration on VHS and now DVD.  I cannot get enough of them.",1400889600,,781,4.6838235294117645
8397373,3,B003IGZZS0,"Received the dvd, and overall its not a bad one.  The humming, and mentioned by another reviewer really was distracting, he hums and makes noises all through the dvd.",1400025600,,166,4.724137931034483
8397374,4,B003IGZZS0,I enjoyed learning with this teacher except for his humming as he worked. It was so distracting. He is a wonderful artist.,1374969600,,122,4.590909090909091
8397375,5,B003IGZZS0,"Taking other watercolor pictures and painting them in his way was very interesting, his instruction is very educational and has helped me",1357862400,2,137,5.2727272727272725
8397376,5,B003IGZZS0,I watch this DVD frequently and learn something every time...I consider Mr Reid as one of the best teachers in W/C  we have .  The DVD is very well done wiht good sound and excellent photography.,1348704000,4,195,4.388888888888889
