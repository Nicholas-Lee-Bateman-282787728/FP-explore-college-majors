795768,4,6304053576,"BOTTOM LINE: This is a much-improved, straightforward & serious sequel to the insultingly stupid previous 'origin' film. Thankfully, you don't need to see that one to enjoy this follow-up. There's plenty of excellently choreographed Hero VS Monster fighting, a thumping synth score, and some cool ideas & backstory to flesh out Our Hero. If only all direct-to-home video flicks were this exciting & energetic. It's like Power Rangers on steroids, only with a darker edge. 4 STAR movie, but a 2 STAR DVD. :-(

THE STORY: (contains spoilers): Sean Barker (David Hayter) is your average guy who unwittingly becomes a superhero when alien bio-armor invades his body, turning him into a kind of organic Iron Man. But does he control it ...or does it control him? That was over a year ago, as our story opens, and Sean has involuntarily continued his bad guy blasting ways ever since. He thinks he may have a clue to discovering more about the weapon inside him (and hopefully a way to get rid of it) in a TV news story about a ""werewolf"" sighting near an archeological dig in rural Utah. Traveling there, Sean immerses himself in the work at the dig site, and is stunned when he learns that his old enemies, Kronos Corporation & their shape-changing soldiers, the Zoanoids, still exist... and are now posed to become an even bigger threat than he ever dared imagine. In addition to Kronos and the Zoanoids, there's a budding romance with a feisty young researcher at the dig, plus unwanted help from a gung ho government agent to keep Sean busy. Things quickly spiral out of control and Sean is forced to call on the fearsome & deadly powers of The Guyver to save his newfound friends. In the end, the very thing Sean hates most may well prove to be his - and Mankind's - only hope. Can Guyver triumph and save the day?

THOUGHTS: I had no idea what to expect when I first saw this as a newly-released flick on VHS tape way back in 1994. I remembered the first GUYVER film and thought it was just awful; bits of interesting action & thrills strangled by a rotten script and the stupid decision to make the whole thing a big joke. Thankfully this sequel avoids that ignorant choice, playing out instead as a straightforward action adventure. Lead star David Hayter is better looking and more intense than the previous actor who played Sean Barker, yet he still projects a disarming, boyish charisma. The occasional jokes here (""I love my job."" ""You're fired!"" etc.) are small asides that break the tension without derailing the primary narrative. The bad guys, while still over-the-top, are nonetheless cunningly cruel & brutally lethal. (This film does not shy away from monster gore!) Biggest downside is that unless you have some familiarity with the Guyver & his universe - either through the previous film or the anime' series - it can be kinda confusing. The movie's stunts are high-energy and show some true flair, especially for a low budget piece. Obviously this was a real labor of love for most of the crew, especially Director / creature costume creator / a little of everything else, Steve Wang. The soundmix is impressive, with lots of cool sound bites used during the fights and to represent the powered-up aspects of The Guyver. Special mention to composer Les Claypool, for a surprisingly energetic, properly heroic score that knows when to play it quiet and when to rev it up when our blue-armored hero is kicking monster butt. Kudos, Mr. Claypool!

THE DVD: The original 2004 DVD release has long been out of print. So, your choices are either buying a used copy of an old DVD or ponying up to get this new no frills M.O.D. release from Warner Bros. Archive. Prior to this the majority of WB-Archive titles I'd bought were nice looking & sounding. Bad news, Guyver fans. That is definitely NOT the case here. While the audio is mostly clean & level (though a little on the soft side), the video portion of this Manufactured-On-Demand release is quite poor. Very soft-looking picture, loaded with dirt & debris. The source material for the transfer would appear to be a heavily-used DVD. I realize this kind of film is sort of a specialty title, still, there's no reason not to spend a little extra cash to strike a decent quality transfer. Hopefully someday a fan-centric company (like Shout! Factory, Kino Lorber or Olive Films) will license GUYVER 2 and take the proper steps necessary to affect a quality transfer in hi-def; (and perhaps even bundle it together with the first Guyver, as a 2-disc double feature Blu-ray). Packing in some decent bonus goodies, in the way of interviews with the cast & crew, would also be more than welcome. Until then, this disappointing barebones DVD re-issue is all we have.",1476057600,,4725,4.7527405602923265

795841,5,6304053576,"I couldn't have been more happy with this movie... Well, okay, that's not true. Despite my giving this film five stars, it does have problems, but I'm personally able to overlook them. The one thing that hurts the movie the most is the acting. It's not really the most solid onscreen performances, but I personally feel that's the only thing that comes close to being a distraction and it really shouldn't be. This is B-movie schlock at its finest. If you're into things like Sci-Fi, low budget stuff like that, I personally feel this is top of the line in that department.

The suits and practical effects are top-notch. Yes, this movie uses man-in-suit monsters like Godzilla and yes it is realistic. Almost makes me wish the guy who did those effects (who also directed the movie) had actually made an American Godzilla film. It probably would've turned out better than both American films combined. Anyways, back to subject. The practical effects are totally off the FREAKING HOOK!!!! They look so real and it is so exciting to watch them do pound and ground, wrestling, martial arts, MMA, and all that kind of fighting in this movie with the titled character. As many have stated before, it plays out like an R-rated version of Power Rangers and if that sounds up your alley, this movie is for you.

Also, the music score is absolutely fantastic. Most people tend not to like it and say it's hammy and stuff, but I personally think it may be one of my favorite film scores ever. I know I've been gushing over this movie, but I can't help it. I thought it was that good. Also the story is interesting in my opinion, but admittedly just interesting enough. All this and more make ""Guyver 2"" a thousand times better than the first movie (even though I still sort of like that one, too). That may or may not have to do with the fact that this movie more closely follows the manga the two movies were based off of, but I can't be sure. I really wish they could've made more Guyver movies. This series was screaming for more installments in it and so was I.

I also love the way this movie looks and how it was shot. Everything was right about it. Overall, good effects, good fight choreography, great camera work, great lighting, great music, interesting story, great design overall, and good everything else (except acting). It left mt wanting more, but for all the right reasons. It's no ""King's Speech"", but it''s not suppose to be and I wouldn't want it to be.

Very violent fight scenes, people transforming into monsters, some cheesy acting, and the guy who voiced Solid Snake for most of the Metal Gear games as the lead character.

In comparison to the first film, Guyver 2 aka Guyver 2 The Dark Hero, is a better overall film.  Guyver 2 pretty much covers the majority of the major plot points of part 1 via exposition between characters.  In other words I am saying you don't need to see part 1 to enjoy this sequel.",1425513600,2,594,4.306306306306307

795968,2,6304053576,"Only a marginal improvement on the first film.  The basic problems remain the same: repetitious fight sequences, monster costumes that look patently silly, cackling villains, and an obvious plot development: finding a space ship.  They tried to take things too seriously this time out, beginning with the breakup of the lead character and his girlfriend of the first film (both played by different actors and not much in the way of an upgrade).  While the first film was dopey, this one was mopey.  Even worse, the plot was infinitely forgettable.  It had something to do with an archeological dig half populated by rubber thingies prone to cackling and beating their chests for effect.  I like camp and camping as well as the next person but in this case, they just went too far with it.  Lame by any name: The Guyver 2.",1344470400,,821,4.73943661971831

Many people have been complaining about this and I can see why... When I order something I expect the item to be NEW and UNDAMAGED! Do they have to be that lazy to take a knife and slice away? Companies are suppose to be using a MARKER for the barcode... This prevents damage to the case... It's real simple...

As for the dvd itself... It could of been better... It was bare bones... No extras at all... That to me is a sloppy job... They could of added some cast interviews, art galleries ect... It's a good movie and I feel that it could of had better treatment...",1342915200,,859,4.302469135802469

What surprised me was that it was covered up by a vertical sticker and then a horizontal sticker with the product bar code on it. That is an obviuos attempt to hide serious damage to a product. Perhaps it was just a lazy employee but when I reordered I received another package with the same damage. I know it was a different DVD with the same damage because I had removed the wrap on the first one before I discovered what was hidden and the plastic wrap on this one was also cut just like the first. Unbelievable! I don't know how many damaged ones are out there but I wouldn't recommend ordering this one. At least Amazon has a decent return policy.

796014,4,6304053576,"In order to find out the truth behind his new found powers, Sean Barker sets off to the mountains of Utah to visit an archaeological dig where sightings of the monstrous Zoanoids have been reported by the locals. The dig uncovers a derelict alien spacecraft that houses the secrets behind The Guyver and Sean's shape-shifting enemies. THE GUYVER 2 drops the silly slapstick and humor that hampered the first film in place of a darker atmosphere and mood that is much more in line with the original source material. While acting and writing only show minor improvements, the fight choreography in Steve Wang's action sequences have improved dramatically, and the deaths of the creatures are far more gruesome than before. Wang's own design crew has stepped in for Screaming Mad George, proving that they are more than competent as they produce equally stunning costuming and monster effects that rival the best Hollywood has to offer. The new Guyver suit is more lightweight and maneuverable, and allows martial artist Anthony Houk with a greater range of motion and control. Its features have also been exaggerated, with longer blades and increased muscle tone. Finally, the unique set designs for the alien craft that were created on the film's small budget are just as impressive. THE GUYVER 2 is a fast-paced and action-packed super-hero sequel that is a vast improvement over the original film.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FIRST MOVIE!!!! IT IS A TOTAL JOKE AND AN ABSOLUTE INSULT TO THE ANIME SERIES. Start the FIRST movie without a plot, then add terrible actors wearing cheesy fake rubber suits multiplied by low budget CGI special effects equals a receipt for disaster.

Guyver 2 Dark Hero has everything the original lacks. Solid acting (though somewhat cheesy at times but forgivable) a good plot that actually resembles the anime series, and great special effects considering the year (1994) and tight budget.

I have been a fan of The Guyver for many years now, and later when I became a fan of Metal Gear Solid games I realized that David Hayter was The Guyver.  Putting Solid Snake and The Guyver together made this movie 100 times cooler for me, making this one of my all time favorite movies.

The story does suffer some bad lines here and there and the length of the overall production is hindering. It is clear the producers were hesitant to edit anything out of this film. The Guyver suit is much better in this version than the last, the muscular appearance more resembling its anime counterpart. The coolest part of this film is the Guyver/Zoanoid hybrid, who provides an excellent final villian for the film.

796020,3,6304053576,"Trying to make up for the campiness of the first movie, Guyver 2 takes itself way too seriously while not improving the quality overall.

When I first saw this movie, I though it was awesome, because it was serious and the costume looked closer to the original anime design.  But upon reflection I realized that it's not as enjoyable to watch for exactly those reasons.

The Good:

-As previously stated, the costume matches the anime perfectly.

-It explains the origins of The Guyver very faithfully.

-The action is faster and more brutal, in keeping with the anime series.

The Bad:

-The acting is still terrible, so you don't care about the characters.

-Just for the sake of action in the opening scene, The Guvyer now thinks he's Batman and is busting a bunch of thugs for no reason.

-The low production value and poor cinematography is the same as the first, so really all your getting is a humorless version of the 1st movie.

And that's the bottom line, it's still B-movie quality, but without the tongue-in-cheek humor of the first film, there is very little to make you go back and watch the movie a second time.

796055,5,6304053576,"Alright here is the Deal Guyver 1 the 1st movie was alright. But Guyver 2 Dark Hero is a BIG STEP UP!! It is a great movie. Acting is somewhat kinda iffy sometimes. But good non the less! I was dissapointed that Guyver III wasn't in the movie. I mean I figred sence they did the 1st one they would bring more people from the original anime adult cartoons. Over all freaking 5 stars its one of the best movies out there. I say buy this and buy the DVD Set for the Anime version I kinda think it's better than the movies. And if you are pleased with Dark Hero and all 12 episodes, then get the 1st live action Guyver movie.",1129075200,4,621,4.056910569105691
796056,4,6304053576,"When you watch a lot of low-budget sci-fi films, you can't help but realize there's a lot of terrible stuff out there.  Stuff so bad that it's not even funny.  But every once in a while, between the terrible stuff, and the unintenionally amusing films, you discover something like this.  I've seen this a couple of times, and every time I just enjoy the heck out of it.  It shows what imagination, clever writing, and a good special effects crew can accomplish even with limited resources.

The story is good, and the acting, while not always great, is always solid.  But what really gets me about this film is the action sequences, strange hybrids of mutant monsters and bizarrely improbably kung fu.  Since I enjoy both these genres, it's nice to have a film blend them so well.  They're a blast.

This is based on some anime show which I'm only vaguely familiar, but it seems true to the original concept.  That's a neat trick, since animation doesn't always crossover into live action as gracefully as in this film.

See it if you like some over the top action with an interesting story.  ""Guyver 1"" is okay, though not nearly as good.  If you've seen the first and didn't like it, give this one a shot.  And if you haven't seen the first, it won't stop you from enjoying this film.

Highly recommended.",1119312000,11,1307,4.549356223175966

If you pay attention to the anime and movie, you will notice similarities between them. One is where Sean jumps off the cliff and changes into the Guyver in midair! In the anime, he jumped off a fence at his school (very high up) and did the exact same thing. Steve Wang and his crew did an excellent job.

David Hayter I believed delivered a strong performance that is worthy of attention. Also, let's not forget that the first movie never showewd him using his laser (located above the Control Metal) even once! The fight scenes are superb (especially the fight between the Guyver and the Guyver Zoanoid). The only thing that I disliked was some of the dialouge, but it's forgivable.

796059,4,6304053576,"I was a fan of the Japanese anime before I saw the live action version, and while I thought it was awsome at the time (I was 13 I think) I now see it as a cheesy B movie.  The fact is that in the original movie they just didn't take the material seriously.  The treated it as a kids movie, but it was to gory for kids so they decided to advertise it as an adult movie, and they failed.

Many scenes in the movie where actually designed to make fun of the fact that there were genetically enhanced monsters and add to that the cheesy fight sequances and you've got a bad B movie.

It really sucks that you have to watch the first one to understand where this one comes from but it's actually worth it because this is so much better!  First of all the actually took the material seriously and didn't gear it towards the kiddies.  David Hayter (The Guyver) is about a million times the actor that what's his name from the first one was.  The script was actually very solid and had a real point to it.  The action was excelent, especially for such a low budget film.  The fight choreography is top notch and overall the only real problem was one or two bad lines of dialouge, but oh well.  It's still B movie material (Movies with shape changing monsters and cyborg superheroes always will be), but this is as good as it gets!",1099440000,,1322,4.2103174603174605

To help better explain how sweet this movie is I am going to compare it to Spawn. The reason why I think these two movies are similar (and sweet) is because of the theme that both movies hold, how the main characters changed (mentally and physically) after recieving their new powers, how awsome their costumes were, and the carnage each of them released upon their enemies.",1097107200,,497,4.595505617977528

This film was about as good as an anime to live action adaptation can be without a big hollywood budget behind it.  It kept the mood of the original manga and anime, and even though the film was probably on an even tighter budget than the first, Steve Wang did a great job of masking the special effect deficiencies with good lighting and camera work.  The acting was surprisingly good for this kind of film, with the lead David Hayter being the standout as the Guyver's tormented host, and the fight scenes were very well done.
I'm eagerly anticipating the remastered widescreen DVD version, and will be picking it up the day it's released.  Thanks, New Line!",1087516800,2,762,4.6716417910447765

When I saw ""Guyver 2"", I thought that they had captured the essence of a superhero that didn't know if he was a good guy or not, like the same dilemma that was bestowed upon DareDevil in his film.
This has all the makings of a good ""Comicbook-to-movie"" film that it's over and above any understanding that superhero fans don't check out this film.  It has good fight scenes (although some of the dialogue is a bit campy) and the special effects are good considering that it's an indie film.

It's so involving you wish you where the Guyver. David Hayter is a vast improvement on the original guy who played Sean Barker, and just in case you didn't know, David Hayter wrote the screen play for the excellent X-Men movie and did the voice of Solid Snake for Metal Gear Solid one and two. I didn't see the anime series until a few years later and was blown away by that to. So to all you anime/sci-fi fans, i recommend you buy this one, and get the first one, if only to make sure you know what's going on in Guyver 2. Even though it's been 10 years, i still hope they get round to doing a third Guyver to bring it full circle. Well, go on, buy it.

796115,4,6304053576,"Fans of the Guyver Manga, Anime and original live-action flick will get a kick out of this sometimes cheesy, but thoroughly entertaining flick. Sporting talent that includes Director Steven Wang (who also directed Drive, the Power Rangers Movie, and did special FX for a wide range of Horror and Sci-Fi movies) and David Hayter (voice actor for Solid Snake and writer of the X-Men movie screenplay) in the lead role of Sean Barker, Guyver 2 improves upon the original with a stronger emphasis on martial arts, drama, and character development.
Special effects, such as the transformation of Sean into the Guyver are either cleverly hidden, or done courtesy of CGI that still manages to impress nowadays. A well-done score by Les Claypool III helps add a dark mood and sense of urgency to many scenes, particularly fight scenes.
The majority of people seem to either love or hate this film, and I fall into the latter category; it's definitely gots its weak points with some cheesy villain character designs, gangster cliches (as depicted in the opening intro sequence), and the usual romance involving a cynical woman who eventually warms to a misunderstood hero.

7863207,4,6304053576,"I'll be honest- most of the people who rated this 5 stars must have watched it immediately after the first.
Imagine Power Rangers but with only one ranger, and the other five are replaced by blood and some pretty solid creature effects. It's not exactly an accurate retelling of the original Guyver story, but it's a good, fun movie based on its own merits. The action is great, and the story is actually relatively free of grievous plot holes.
It's a far cry from the travesty that was the original. In fact, you're better off not watching that one at all. Sure, it gives us Sean's origins as the Guyver, but please don't subject yourself to that kind of psychological torture. That's why I say the five-star ratings come from comparing it to the first one- it makes Dark Hero look like Ridley Scott's magnum opus or something.
If you're a tokusatsu junkie like me, you'll love it. If you're just looking for a cheesy 90's movie to kill a couple of hours, you'll love it. But if you're hoping for an actual good movie, you'd better stay away.",1525996800,,1043,4.523809523809524
