7159882,4,B00X797L62,"yes some parts were predictable.. I am hoping the end of season five isn't.. You know like assignation of the president... ,,, Hoping season five is really the end of scandal.. I don't see any more lead way with this tv series... and the end we all know how it's going to end...  hope they really write a surprise ending, that none of us already see..: )",1436832000,3,354,4.2835820895522385
7159883,3,B00X797L62,"Let us bow down to the Queen of Thursday nights on network TV.  Three smash hits in a row is nothing to sneeze at.  Shonda Rhimes has hooked the TV viewing audience with ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Scandal"" and most recently ""How To Get Away With Murder"" and she owns Thursday like no single producer has ever owned a single night before.  And as the fourth season of ""Scandal"" progressed there were increasing signs that, alas, success is going to Shonda's head.

The season started off predictably enough with Olivia and Jake enjoying a blissful hiatus on an unnamed island in the middle of nowhere, hidden even from her psychotic dad Rowan, when they are unexpectedly tracked down by Quinn to let Olivia know that Harrison Wright has turned up dead.  OPA has been disbanded; Quinn is off doing her thing, Huck is working in a computer store and is in a snit at feeling abandoned, and Abby is the White House press secretary and acting very bitchy at Olivia running off without telling anybody.  The first half of the season proceeds satisfyingly enough, with OPA getting partially back together (Olivia, Quinn and Huck) solving various cases while Mellie is in a drunken stupor most of the time over the death of her son.  But for some reason I am at a total loss to fathom, Shonda threw in four episodes dealing with Olivia being kidnapped and auctioned on the Dark Web at the instigation of Vice President Andrew Whats-His-Face (I can't even remember the guy's name), Fitz's old buddy who turns out to be boinking not only Mellie but also the head of the Republican National Committee, known as Lizzie Bear (the purpose behind the kidnapping was evidently to hold Olivia hostage while blackmailing Fitz into undoing some of his more moderate acts which cause his right-wing constituents to have spasms and heaves), and the season disintegrated into absolute chaos.  Not even a couple of good episodes after Olivia is rescued by, of all people, her former OPA colleague Stephen who left to get married and have a normal life (of course that didn't work out but who expected it would, given what a womanizer he was?) could save the season at that point.  I was almost glad when the season ended before it imploded out of sheer idiocy.

A lot of the problem is Shonda herself thinking she can do no wrong.  This is her show and she is running it, and if her audience doesn't like the direction she is taking it in, too bad for them.  But Shonda's arrogance is going to be her undoing if she doesn't rein it in.  Her audience is what made her show so popular and when they tell her enough is enough, she needs to start listening.  This was especially evident when Rowan and the whole B613 story line kept getting dragged into every other episode to the point of sheer exhaustion, never mind ennui.  Shonda should have kicked B613 to the curb last season; that story line was already old and stale.  But no, she had to keep dragging it along like a desiccated corpse as if anybody still cared about it, and Joe Morton, who I had always respected as an actor, became absolutely godawful, turning each speech into a Shakespearian rant and Wag.ging. His. Head. With. E.ve.ry. Sin.gle.  Syl.la.ble as if this is some new kind of method acting he invented all by himself.  Whatever it is, it's a crashing bore to watch.  It got to the point where I had to change the channel during his interminable rants.  It was either that or throw a shoe at the screen.  Another problem was Shonda threw so many WTF moments into this season that they became annoying.  A few WTFs add interest to a series; too many is like a 10-course dinner that is 9 courses dessert.  It's sensory overload and ultimately ends up being sensory deprivation.  Never mind the WTFs, just tell the story.

A third problem is that Shonda seems to be letting her characters run away with her.  We always knew Mellie was shallow and spiteful but this season she turned absolutely soulless, telling Fitz their son died to ensure his re-election and going along with a busload of people being killed to ensure her senatorial nomination.  Cyrus is a straight-up demon, passively acquiescing to Olivia's kidnapping and hoping she will be killed because she knows too much about him.  And Huck... I can't even.  Shonda has turned Huck into a bloodthirsty ghoul whose favorite pastime is killing people.  He's become an absolute monster.  I don't even know if he's redeemable at this point.  The only character who has become more interesting is Quinn, who went from being a whiny pest in the third season to going total badass in the fourth season.  Nobody better mess with this girl because she is BAAAAD.  She's a lot more fun now.

Shonda ended the season by doing a total unexpected re-set.  Mellie and Cyrus finally went too far even for Fitz and both of them are sacked -- Cyrus from his job as Chief of Staff and Mellie as First Lady.  (Fitz has put Lizzie Bear in Cyrus' place, an act of transcendental stupidity that is going to bite him in the butt before the fifth season is off the ground.)  Jake has finally come to his senses and realized Olivia is never going to leave Fitz, and has walked away from the whole hopeless relationship.  And Olivia has ensconced herself back into the White House and into Fitz's bed, and it's nice to see them back together while it lasts, which almost certainly won't be for more than an episode or two next season before they have a major fight and everything blows to smithereens.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

So -- how to rate this season?  I'll give the first half four stars, the kidnapping interlude a big fat zero, and the second half two stars (I'm being generous here) which rounds out to three.  Let's hope Shonda gets the series back on track before it's too late.

P.S.  I'm editing this review to add a brief note: be sure to watch the extended version of episode 22, the season finale.  There's some really good stuff in here that had to be omitted from the finale shown on TV due to time limitations.",1436745600,19,6013,4.597560975609756

7159946,4,B00X797L62,"I really want to give more of a 3.5/4.

I was with this show and its promise to focus more on the stories outside of the love triangle in season 4... and it somewhat achieved that in the beginning -- but towards the end, we just continue to go through the same old circles with Papa Pope, Millie, Olivia, Fitz, and Jake. The finale itself was lackluster in its takedown of an important season-long storyline, and the setup for season 5 feels like we are backtracking into old story habits.

I fell behind every so often this season because of the repetition. I'm still in for season 5... but not without hesitation.

Just how much longer can we keep this show going???",1442620800,,668,4.459016393442623

7159953,1,B00X797L62,"If it's free, it's a great way to waste an evening. Sadly, the two leading characters are the least inspired and believable characters in the show--with many of the supporting cast members doing a much better job.

Kudos to ABC for intentionally including African-Americans in lead roles, but Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope (and her hideously collagen over-stuffed lips) is almost cartoonish in the two basic states she presents: either misty-eyed on the verge of tears or shouting about things that really shouldn't be quite so alarming. Except for her fashion show strut, and the ability to make her over-processed hair bounce with every step, I have no idea why she is in the role. She could be the poster child for the current crop of narcissistic, selfish, and demanding hipster and thug-wannabe types.

Season Three and Four have become gratuitous in their use of contrived sex scenes--the show qualifies in every regard as soft-core porn, and I suspect the writers have simply ran out of ideas and surrendered their craft to the masturbatory fantasies of post-pubescent teenage boys. It really has become crude and contrived.",1442188800,5,1133,5.086021505376344
