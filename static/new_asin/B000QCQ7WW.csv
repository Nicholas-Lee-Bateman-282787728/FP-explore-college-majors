8195438,4,B000QCQ7WW,"Master Tak Wah Eng has generously revealed his training regimen for Iron Palm training.  Overall, he demonstrates techniques like most Sifu's, teaching by doing, without very much explanation.  I have over 30 years experience in Northern Shaolin Kung Fu, and because of this background, I was able to decipher the majority of Master Tak's training methods.  A beginner will likely have trouble understanding and following the techniques outlined in his video instruction.  Nevertheless, I found Master Tak's work very revealing, and an excellent addition to Wing Lam's work on Iron Palm training method's.  Wing Lam fails to provide training in<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kur-s-Rage-Part-One-of-the-Duaredheim-Staff-Saga/dp/1432710133/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kur's Rage: Part One of the Duaredheim Staff Saga</a>&nbsp;breaking techniques, while Master Tak's video demonstrates several of them.  For students developing the Iron Palm on their own, without an available Master, this video will reveal many secrets!",1329868800,2,1057,6.568345323741007
8195439,5,B000QCQ7WW,"This dvd is one of the better dvds on the iron palm. I have been doing martial arts for 44 years now, and this dvd is the closest thing to what I was taught, by my Chinese Shifu (master).  It does not include the key element of, ""the iron itself"" however, I found it really good for adding to my martial arts collection of books and dvds. There are several dvds on the market currently, on the iron palm, but mostly on these dvds they go on about dit da jow and less on how to obtain the iron palm technique. I would highly recommend this dvd to add to your collection (more for the advanced martial artist) but would be interesting to the novice to give them some idea of what iron palm entails.",1302307200,,696,4.155555555555556
8195440,1,B000QCQ7WW,"The production of the DVD is good.  Master Tak Wah Eng seems to know what he is doing but he does not explain anything. I bought this DVD to supplement my Iron Palm training by what I was being taught, to get a second opinion.  There is no explaination on Qigong breathing, how to breath properly when you hit the bag, anything!

You just watch Sifu Eng hit the bag and that's it. I wish I hadn't bought it.",1191196800,10,407,4.1265822784810124
