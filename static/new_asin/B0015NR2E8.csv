8259293,5,B0015NR2E8,"Noel Coward and his very diverse works have influenced the worlds of theater, film and music far beyond his own life.  In this one DVD Set you get one of the best and most thorough documentaries of any public figure.  In these 3 programs a very detailed view of his life, his world and his magnificent work in the Theater, Film, and later Cabaret Performances.  He is one of my heroes, and if you do not know this great, talented man, buy this DVD Set and you will be Astonished, and very, very happy.  5 Stars are not enough! - James B.

8259294,5,B0015NR2E8,"PBS broadcast a much briefer version of this documentary. The full length trilogy is a non-stop delight for this Coward fan, packed with rare footage from his career and contemporary visits to his homes and other locations connected with his life. The final sequence, an interview with his longtime companion Graham Payne, is incredibly touching. This loving tribute truly does ""The Master"" proud.",1374105600,4,397,5.317460317460317
8259295,4,B0015NR2E8,Just goes to show how the wealthy&celebrities are low-life trash and raw sewage.  those with lots of money are liar and garbe whores.  Criminals with seperate rules due to ALL their money.,1326758400,,188,4.84375
8259296,5,B0015NR2E8,"I recommend this film for anyone who is looking to better understand the life and times of Noel Coward.  I have enjoyed his lyrical talents on a superficial level, listening to Sail Away.  I sought out this film for the sake of curiosity about the man behind the performance and I wasn't disappointed.  It appears Noel Coward's approach to self-promotion and style would eventually influence actors and society personalities alike, to this day.  I am amazed at his luck and his sense of irony.  One thing that is missing from the film is a query of some of the people he would later satirize.  I wanted to see more of that line of thought developed.  Despite this, the film was deeply informative and highly entertaining.",1264377600,11,721,4.72
