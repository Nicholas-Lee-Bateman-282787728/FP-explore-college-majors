The first twelve minutes of the video is the instructor explaining his history and given a run down of what to expect. Then the workout,which has flashy music for hills and sprints. The last bits are the instructor taking you through the proper set up of the bike.
  Scince this is the only video on the market-that I've come across-for spinning its not to bad. Like I said its all depends on how hard you push yourself.
 Somebody put more spinning DVD's out on the market.",1050192000,3,599,4.427272727272728
7867774,4,630429171X,"Yeah! I really know that sometimes these kind of videos get too bored once you get used, but I think Johnny G help you to make your own spinning routine, he really helped me in my spinning routines, sometimes I can't go to the gym and I go to see my own and private trainer and create my personal routines.
These both videos are good for people of all fitness levels, that enjoy to exercise alone, if you like groups, don't try it, but if you do, try it once and you'll see.
Thanks Johnny G!!",1033689600,,492,4.135416666666667

On the other hand, the market doesn't offer a wide variaty of choices so, for beginners, this should hit the spot.",1018396800,6,357,4.682539682539683
7867776,3,630429171X,"My husband and I are new to spinning and found the  video helpful in teaching us the basics, like hand positions and proper sitting positions.  It really helps us work out harder than if we only had music on or were  watching t.v.  He guides you through a decent workout.  Definitely for  beginners, and there's stuff you'll have to fast forward through, and  finally,once you have the hang of it, you have to ignore his requests for  beginners to take it easy or take a break.  We just follow the pack.  The  music isn't all that great, but it gets the job done.",953424000,16,563,4.368932038834951
