7902743,4,B000003KB6,"In ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" Episode 66, ""Displaced"" (Teleplay by Lisa Klink, Aired May 14, 1997) we start off with a halfway interesting mystery that gives way to a rather standard resolution to this week's problem.  A Nyrian named Dammar (Kenneth Tigar) suddenly appears on ""Voyager,"" and the crew discovers Kes (Jennifer Lien) has disappeared.  Soon Kim and Tuvok disappear in the same manner, and Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) realizes her crew is being traded off one by one every nine minutes.  Eventually we get to the point where half the crew has been exchanged and we learn that the Nyrians are behind it all.  This is how they steal spaceships.  Apparently the idea of pirates boarding a vessel one at a time, every nine minutes, has been extremely successful for a long time.  Meanwhile, the displaced crews are housed in environments similar to their home worlds (think really, really large cages at the zoo).  Fortunately it turns out the Doctor can be reprogrammed by Torres so that he can see the portals that connect together the various biospheres.  This allows the ""Voyager"" crew to have fun not only retaking their ship but also having to rescue all the other inhabitants of the various biospheres who have been the guests of the Nyrians as well.  If you do not take ""Displaced"" all that seriously it is enjoyable enough, but it is hard not to think that there was a whole bunch of missed opportunities to come up with something better off of this premise.",1067990400,,1465,4.781746031746032

The crew isn't responsible for beaming him aboard, and they soon  discover that Kes mysteriously vanished from the ship at the same instant  Dammar arrived. Not long after, Kim disappears as another Nyrian turns up.  Soon, Tuvok also vanishes.
