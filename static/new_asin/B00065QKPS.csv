2169491,1,B00065QKPS,"I am not quite sure why this movie has such a high rating, given that I turned it off and went to something else halfway through due to the first one, then two, utterly irritating 10-11 year old bratty kids  (in the first 10 minutes while the family is moving, one kid complains about no mall and no cable tv, grills her mother about intimate details of her romantic life while mom is trying to concentrate on driving, and after seeing the new house goes outside to get into the driver's seat of the car and starts honking the horn repeatedly in a demand they go back where they came from), the idiocy of the mother who acts like the ultra permissive parenting guru with kids and like a complete jerk with (some) adults and blithely ignores laws so commonly known she stamps herself as an unbelievable character, the stereotyped boyfriend who acts like a cardboard cutout of the hayseed and the lover left behind rolled into one, and more.  The scenery and cinematography are good, but unless you like unbelievable silly characters, brats who get away with literally everything, no chemistry whatsoever between romantic leads, and stereotypes woodenly walked through galore, find a better flick to watch so you won't be disappointed",1484352000,,1232,4.779342723004695

2169529,5,B00065QKPS,"A very lovely movie from 1995 that I had not seen before.  It stars Randy Travis and Connie Selleca as two people who had been close to marrying years ago.  When she returns to town with her daughter the two of them don't seem to get along -- not Mom and her old flame nor Mom and her daughter, who doesn't want to be stuck in a town with no mall and no cable TV and ...

2169602,5,B00065QKPS,"This is an excellent movie for any age to watch, very tasteful, all the characters are wonderful in their respective parts.  It is a very heartwarming story of a young boy but also a  story of romance which is amusing enough to keep your attention.  At Christmastime, a divorce (Connie Sellecca) returns to her home town and reacquaints herself with her ex-fianc (Randy Travis).  Rue McClanahan is also quite funny as the aunt of Randy Travis.  I would recommend this to anyone.",1390435200,,478,4.780487804878049

It was a cold brutal December and had to drag myself out of bed to do my Christmas shopping. Let me say the acting is not Emmy worthy, the Wlliam character is a little too precious. Randy Travis is a mite wooden but his character is supposed to be. Rue McClanahan is excellent as usual. Despite all this, It just holds up as a warm Christmas movie.",1387843200,,438,3.9886363636363638

2169611,2,B00065QKPS,"After reading how favorably impressed everyone else was, I thought I'd love this movie. But I don't.  The plot was a lovely idea, but probably would have suited a novel rather than a movie script.  The worst part was the actors (except Rue McLanahan), who were wooden and transitions between scenes were uneven.  The acting was so poor that I couldn't pay attention to the movie.  IMHO, Randy Travis needs acting lessons, pronto!",1385942400,,429,4.835616438356165
2169612,5,B00065QKPS,"I watch A Holiday to Remember on TV every year at Christmas.  It's an endearing story of happy-ever-afters for everyone involved.  Connie Sellecca and Randy Travis make a surprisingly cute couple, and the kids in the story are fun to watch.

I'll keep it simple, if you enjoy a nice family movie, wonderful acting, and an awesome cast, try A Holiday to Remember. It's not frilly, but it is memorable and goes straight to the heart. I've seen it many times, and never tire of it. It is also kinda rare to see Randy Travis in this sort of role, and he really fits my picture of the good guy that stays true to himself.

2169635,2,B00065QKPS,"This movie, starring the beautiful Connie Seleca and interesting choice, Randy Travis (What a missed opportunity as he does not sing!!!!) was sort of a flop.  I agree with the other negative review that the female lead is way too harsh with the male lead considering she left him at the altar.  There's very little chemistry (what a shame!) between the lead characters, and it takes a little too long for them to explain why she left for the film to ""work"".  However, if you like to collect every Christmas romance under the sun, go ahead and buy it.

The performances are uniformly good with Connie Selleca and a hilarious Rue McClanahan the obvious standouts; and the story is warm and funny and brings out all of those good holiday feelings we all cherish during this season.

12/30/2011 review of, ""A Holiday to Remember"" starring Connie Selleca & Randy Travis

What a delightful Christmastime movie!  A divorced, mom with a professional career takes her young teenage daughter & moves back to her hometown.  There's a love story, a ""villainess,"" a boy & his dog, a church complete with the birth of Christ-story, snow, mom wrapped in Christmas lights-a-glowing, anger, hurt, disappointment, and then the happy ending (of course!).  Its a light-hearted, fun movie with some serious moments interspersed.  Try it.  You just might like it.  I loved it & have watched it year after year.  I was so glad to see that Amazon had it on DVD -- finally.  I have looked for it for the last couple of years.

I felt that all of the actors -- all of them -- did such an excellent job with their roles.  And, who could not love the boy & his dog??!!

FOR AMAZON:
Please make this an Instant Video for those of us wishing to store this on a hard drive.  Thanks. And thanks for bringing this fine family movie on DVD.",1325203200,2,1185,5.141361256544503

True love never dies and sometimes we just have to go back to where it all began and that's what happened in this movie.  going back to her old home town for a fresh start, Caroline got more than she bargained for.  but it was all worthwhile.

2169674,5,B00065QKPS,This is a movie that will make you realize what Christmas is really all about.  It's a wonderful story of a divorced woman who really found out what she missed out on in her earlier life.  She is trying to get her teenage daughter to learn what really matters in life.  Randy Travis is so good in his role.  He is just a ordinary guy that let what really mattered to him get away.  Now the two of them need to decide what they really need and want in life.  A lot of lessons are learned along the way by a lot of people.  This is very good intertainment.  A very good Christmas Movie.,1323907200,,584,4.06140350877193
2169675,4,B00065QKPS,"Despite its flaws, I love this movie. The down-home, country charm of the whole thing overwhelms any less-than-perfect details. Connie Selleca and Randy Travis make an unusual pair--Connie is so elegant and sophisticated and Randy is so...country, but it works.  It would be more believable that Jordy would instantly accept her mother's revived interest in her old flame if Jordy's dad had died and there was no possibility of her parents getting back together.  The story is set in South Carolina, but the movie was filmed in Canada, so no wonder the snow looks so real and so cold.",1323734400,,584,4.888888888888889

2169679,5,B00065QKPS,"This movie is a good clean movie.  The plot isn't the best, but if you like Randy Travis, you will love this movie.  There are no R rated scenes in this movie.  It is a movie I would not be afraid to let my grandchildren watch.  Randy Travis isn't the best actor (but he is the best singer around) but it is well worth the purchase.  You really have to like family movies to enjoy this one.  But to me, Randy Travis fits the bill in this movie.",1322784000,,444,3.9886363636363638

The only trouble was that there wasn't much. All the pieces to the puzzle were in place, but they didn't quite fit together. I guess if you had a thing for Randy Travis, it would have been much better. In my opinion he's a much better Country Singer than actor.....real stiff. But its not a horrible movie, just not one you want to see over and over again. Not Unhappy that I added it to my Christmas collection.",1321315200,,565,4.289719626168225
2169682,5,B00065QKPS,"This is a great holiday movie, it is one of my favorites. I'm glad to see it back out on DVD at a great price. Rue McClanahan plays a sassy and funny role in this movie. I enjoy watching this movie every year.
This movie is about a divorced woman, (Connie Sellecca) that dicides to move back to her old small hometown. Her teenage daughter is reluctant to go, no malls in small towns. The woman runs into an old love, (Randy Travis). Together they discover a runaway boy that's been sleeping in the basement in need of a family. Rue McClanahan, (Blanche in The Golden Girls) plays Randy Travis' aunt who doesn't mind telling it like it is. She knows that they are meant to be together.",1321142400,,685,4.359375

2169684,5,B00065QKPS,"I had seen this movie and really liked it. It was not available to buy then. I have since purchased it and have enjoyed it. Its a comfy movie. A newly- divorced professional woman decides on  not only changing her marital status, but her life, as well as her just-entered-her-teens, Daughter's life. Moves back to her small town, runs into a long-lost , but never forgotten love, she ,many years before, left at the alter. It is a story about,love, compassion, starting over and possibly having a better life than ever. Get a hot-chocolate ready!",1319241600,21,546,4.747368421052632
2169685,4,B00065QKPS,"The always perfect looking Connie Sellecca plays Carolyn Giblin, an L.A. therapist who divorces her cheating husband, takes her young teenage daughter, and moves back to her hometown of Mayville, to the old house she inherited from her Grandma. Randy Travis plays Clay Traynor, the long ago flame that she literally left standing at the alter (""lookin' like an idiot in a rented tuxedo"") when she skipped town many years ago. Rue McClanahan turns in her usual top-notch performance as Travis' aunt, Miz Leona, who usually speaks her mind.
Carolyn wants to escape the rat race of the city and have a quiet, hometown Christmas. Her daughter, Jordy, is disgruntled over the move and the fact that Mayville doesn't even have a mall or cable (though she doesn't seem to spend much time missing her father). Things aren't quite as serene as Carolyn hoped. The house is a shambles, there is a runaway in the form of a young boy (William) hiding in the basement with his dog, and Clay Traynor is still in Mayville. He is constantly thrown in her path and is still annoyingly attractive to her. Through his interference the woman from social services, Eve, comes to get the boy to place him in foster care just before Christmas and it is at that point that Carolyn realizes there is something going on between Clay and Eve. Why should that bother her? She has already made it clear that she isn't interested in him  anymore.
Jordy and the runaway spend a lot of time bickering, Carolyn is constantly spouting psychological theory, Clay keeps busy being the local police, mayor, handyman, and trying to evade Eve's less than subtle pursuit of him, and Miz Leona keeps making pies and dishing out opinions.
By the time Carolyn finally faces the fact that she wants Clay back it is Christmas Day, and Clay drops by to let her know that he realizes he needs to move on and make a commitment to Eve.
If you can get past some of the inconsistencies in this movie (snow on the yard in one scene, then on the same day minutes later the neighbor's yard has almost no snow; a dog that is supposed to be pregnant sure doesn't look it, and the hours-old puppy in the backpack is amazingly large with open eyes, etc.) and some of the things that date it (Sellecca's fashions, cassette tapes, corded phones), then the movie is a pleasant way to pass a holiday evening. Family friendly, but definitely geared to lovers of holiday romance. I don't think my husband would sit through it again.",1318896000,4,2467,4.632420091324201
2169686,5,B00065QKPS,"Loved the movie but be careful where you buy it.  I bought it off of Amazon by a seller who described it as new and the copy was horrible.  I have a better copy of it off the tv.

2169687,1,B00065QKPS,"So let me get this straight,so i sit down to watch this movie,and as a male, father, role model to my 2 kids, this is what i see in the opening scenes......

A soon to be divored mom(dad left us, was the moms description,vague to say the least,all lifetime network watchers take that as all men are scum) and they are driving across country to start over........Does anyone care that the child won't have her father around much anymore?(all lifetime network watchers will respond, don't all men to this?) Apparently so......

Then we get told that she left a future husband(mr travis) at the altar.......No big deal there right? What kind of person would embarrass someone they love like that, embarrass ""both"" families like that, not to mention whomever paid for it, ah, No big deal................

THE TOPPER, when they get to their new old hometown, SHE GIVES THE GUY SHE LEFT AT THE ALTAR,EMBARRASSED IN FRONT OF ALL, ATTITUDE...........and then he softens up to her???
AND THIS IS A HOLIDAY MOVIE!!!!!ROFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!
Believe me, in the sequel, he dumped her because she is a shallow self absorbed misogynist twit........",1292371200,7,1128,4.957671957671957

Everything ends wonderfully, and it's just a quaint setting we all want to live in. I'm so upset this wasn't shown this year. I watch White Christmas, Holiday Inn, this story, and John Denver's The Christmas Gift every year. To me, that's Christmas. The newer stories just don't hold water next to the older beautiful stories, and this is the first time in years they haven't shown it. I didn't even see Holiday Inn or White Christmas this year. The Christmas Gift with John Denver is being shown a day after Christmas. I cannot figure out what all these stations are doing showing war movies during the Christmas season.

We have seen this movie probably hundreds of times (they will watch again after we have our annual first time) and will cry every time we watch it!

2169705,4,B00065QKPS,"the fairy tale of ever lasting love... Very nice! I've given four stars because I think the character of little William, although sweet and well acted, but he is really too good to be true. No child, living on the streets, expresses himself in that way and certainly no such child can be transformed so easily. You can argue, of course, that there is no reality in the story of the couple either. Right. But - don't we all say silly and irrealistic things when we are in love? Or don't we all wish, Mr. Right would wait for us forever, no matter how much we've hurt him? Yes, we do. So that is a different matter. But- never mind, don't think too much about it! Just make a large hot cup of cocoa, lean back and enjoy it, because that's what X-mas movies are made for.
