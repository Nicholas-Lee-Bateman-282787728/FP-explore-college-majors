4110506,5,B003CT351M,"This film gives a glimpse in to the life of Christianity in the Orthodox tradition in Romania through the eyes of a thoughtful spiritual seeker. It focuses on the core of the faith, with meetings with elders, abbots and priests. Definitely worth a look for anyone who is interested or wants to know more about Orthodoxy!",1271721600,11,320,4.732142857142857
8394462,5,B003CT351M,This is a very good film.  Shows many holy men and women in Romania that you would not see otherwise.  Very spiritually enlightening as well.  For anyone interested in Orthodox Christianity this film gets to the heart of spiritual matters.,1396656000,,239,4.925
8394463,5,B003CT351M,It was on her Christmas List - but she never expected her aunt to find it.  She couldn't wait to watch it.,1392681600,,106,3.8181818181818183
8394464,5,B003CT351M,"A moving documentary of the film maker's spiritual pilgrimage and immersion into the beauty and holiness of Eastern Orthodoxy. For those accustomed to the Evangelical Protestant American landscape, seeing how culture (in this case, Romanian) is shaped by Orthodoxy is a refreshing change of pace.",1387324800,2,296,5.6
8394465,1,B003CT351M,"I would love to give this film an excellent review as I'd intended, but so far Amazon has sent me 3 of the discs, not one which will play. I hope any one who orders through Amazon doesn't have a similar situation as they have been clearly alerted and asked to problem solve to avoid further inconvenience to their customers.",1383609600,2,324,4.416666666666667
8394466,5,B003CT351M,A wonderful and most inspiring DVD that I watch again and again - it has a meditative quality for me although I am not orthodox but roman catholic.,1380153600,,147,4.285714285714286
8394467,3,B003CT351M,"there are some great scenes here. the host of this documentary provides some wonderful scenes of Romanian Orthodoxy, as well as intriguing interviews with Romanian elders.

i think where it fails is an overall narrative. what is the purpose of this documentary? what is the film maker trying to achieve?  it sort of meanders along without a clear idea of what it's about.

it's worth buying. i would just like to see a tighter film next time.",1361923200,2,442,4.714285714285714
8394468,5,B003CT351M,"This is a thoughtful and meditative film.  There is an honest searching quality to the interviews, without hidden agendas or axes to grind.  Anyone searching for the ancient signposts of Eastern Christianity along their spiritual path should check this out.

On a technical note, these DVDs are burned to order, and my copy is in PAL, not NTSC as are most DVDs in the US.  Perhaps for that reason, although it played fine on my computer, my DV Dplayer was unable to play it.",1347235200,3,474,4.607142857142857
8394469,5,B003CT351M,"Although not about Orthodox monasticism strictly speaking, it does present a look at what monks are about. It's really more about the journey of discovery for one young man with questions. In that respect it applies to most of us. Many refuse to undertake the journey while some of us are still on the journey after several years. We never learn the pilgrims' decision or if he has given up or continues on or reached his destination. Perhaps it really doesn't matter.

It says it was filmed in 2007 so it took 3 years to get it out on the market. Small budget and time restraints no doubt. Editing may have been an issue. The quality is quite good for this kind of film. I think it is worth the price and hope many people of all religions watch it and it offers hope to all.",1301616000,6,775,4.308219178082192
8394470,5,B003CT351M,"What a find! I enjoyed going on this pilgrimage through the forests of Romania.

This documentary on Orthodox Christian spirituality and the Romanian monasteries is narrated by someone who spent some time there with the monks, immersing himself into their life of prayer.  The writer/director travels to a monastery in Canada then to Bucharest, Romania, and further north to Putna monastery and other sacred sites.  We get to meet novices, young monks, experienced monks and even an unusual hermit, what they call a ""fool for Christ"".

The image was grainy at times (during the night vigils) but this effort to film holy men answering questions about God and prayer (has English translation), and to present a less explored corner of Christian spirituality, deserves 5 stars.",1294790400,12,775,5.176
8394471,5,B003CT351M,"A wonderful documentary for anyone curious about Orthodox Christianity, the life of monks, or about one man's search for spirituality.  Beautiful and fair.  Highly recommended.",1272153600,13,176,6.0
