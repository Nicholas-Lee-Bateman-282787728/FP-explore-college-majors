2294723,5,B0009JFDFO,"This film forces us to look inwardly at our own prejudices and to re-think what assumptions we make about people based on their appearance, their ability to speak or the manner in which they speak.  I have met Sue Rubin and have seen her respond spontaneously to questions using FC (she independently types responses).  She is an inspiration to people with disabilities who so often are wrongly assumed to be incompetent.

One prior reviewer has no problem accepting that people with cerebral palsy may competently use assistive technology yet has difficulty accepting that this could work for people with autism.  These comments reflect a basic lack of understanding of autism.  Having autism does not mean one is cognitively impaired.  Rather, autism is a movement disturbance.  Once one internalizes that basic principle, the idea that people with autism are capable of very complex thought processes is not foreign at all.

I recommend this film for anyone seeking to gain a greater understanding of what it means to be human and how we can better ourselves by assuring that we accept and respect people with differences.  Remember that 100 years ago it was assumed that people who were deaf were mentally retarded.  How ludicrous that notion seems today.",1119916800,12,1259,5.067961165048544
2294724,5,B0009JFDFO,"It seems as if a couple of the reviews here have trouble when someone with Autism behaves in a manner different from what the ""book"" says about Autism or from what they have seen before.  Interestingly, this has happen many times in our past.  People with Cerebral Palsy were treated for generations like they had severe mental retardation--that what you could see is what they were.  Many disabilities have been plagued with the notion that because they look different and act different, they must be ""less than"" those who look and act normally (whatever that is).  Autism is a profound and disabling condition.  And it seems to me when someone with Autism spends their life breaking through to be able to communicate effectively with the rest of the world that we should listen to them, rather than doubt what they say is real.  Can you imagine what Sue Rubin, the star of this film, must feel when after focusing her entire life on fighting her Autism and proving to others she is for real, to have others write here that she is being manipulated?  Oh, how sad a statement about those who must put down what they fear--what they refuse to accept.  THE book on Autism, on disability in general, has yet to be written.  And when it is written, it may very well be authored by the Sue Rubin's of the world.  Be critical about new knowledge, but be open to new possibilities, especially when some people with Autism are working so hard to be heard.  Sue Rubin is talking, are you listening?  This is a great film loaded with a real life story.  It makes you feel good and it makes you cry.  What a life this young woman has had-and she is only 26 years old!  I can't  wait to see the sequel!",1119830400,12,1690,4.473856209150327

Striking how most that would be critical of this type of project (at a distance) lose there own self critic when they are around the mentally disabled and can't reach out or even connect with them on a more than superficial level.

2294726,2,B0009JFDFO,"I saw this movie on TV a week ago, and it troubled me deeply. Purportedly it was written by an autistic woman named Sue Rubin, and it tells her story.  It is either the heartwarming story of a woman locked in a prison of autism until she was rescued by assisted communication.  Or, she is still a retarded, autistic, uncommunicative person being manipulated by her family and some academic supporters of assisted to communications to appear as a genius, a sort of autistic Helen Keller.

It disturbed me enough that I did quite a bit of research since I've seen it, and I am left with the conclusion that this movie is a piece of propaganda for a highly controversial view of autism.  It tells a very one-sided story, and in the end I find myself unconvinced and concerned that parents of autistic children are being misled.  I am giving this movie two, rather than one, star because it does what it set out to do well.  I am only giving it two stars because it is so misleading.  It certainly leaves way too many questions unanswered.

On the surface this is the story of Sue Rubin a 26 year old college student at Whittier college.  Sue Rubin looks and sounds retarded as well as autistic.  Until she was 13 she was considered to have a mental age of three.  Then, with the aid of something called ""assisted communication"" which involves an aid holding her hand while she types on a keyboard, she gradually blossomed into someone with an IQ over 130.  She is still autistic; she is still severely handicapped; she still cannot perform basic functions, but she can read and write and learn.  She graduated high school and she goes to college.

Now, at the first mention of assisted communication,the movie says ""controversial assisted communication.""  It never elucidates.  It never explains.  It just goes from there.

Controversial?  Here's where I was driven to do research.  The community of people who work with autistics are seriously split over this issue.  Many experiments demonstrate that assisted communication in the case of autistics may be little more than (as one critic said) ""using autistic people as a ouija board.""  There is no doubt that assisted communication is real with respect to some handicapped people such as those suffering from cerebral palsy, but there is serious doubt that it is effective with autistics.

So here's where this movie really troubled me.  Is Sue Rubin for real? Or is her ""progress"" an illusion, a combination of wishful thinking from her family and overzealous advocacy by academics with an axe to grind?  The movie never raises or acknowledges this question let alone answers it. It assumes she is ""real.""  Yet, it just isn't possible to tell from the movie.  Did Sue Rubin really write it?  or Did a well-meaning care giver guide her had to write it?  Is it really Sue Rubin communicating, or is it her care-givers?

I don't know.  I can't tell.  I can't tell from this movie and I can't tell from what I read on the web.

On the one hand Sue Rubin supposedly tested over 1300 on the SAT.  I'm sure that she had unlimited time, and I'm sure that her caregiver gave her lots of help.  But still, even with unlimited time the vast majority of people will not score that high, and it's unlikely that her assistant would be that smart, so how did that happen.  And, if you read her writings on the web, to the extent you can find them, they are quite articulate and sophisticated.  Most people can't write that well.  Is it likely that her caregiver would?  Were the writings edited to read so well?  Or, did she really write them.  In some of the writings ""she"" says that she now writes unassisted.  I'd like to see that in the movie. Similarly she does seem to respond with comprehension to what people say to her, and she seems to give appropriate, if hard to understand verbal responses.  Maybe she is for real. I'd like to see the proof.

In the end I really don't know.  This movie disappoints me for pretending the reasons for skeptiscism don't even exist. Because the movie begs the real questions so thoroughly I find it highly suspect.  I'd love to see the evidence that this story is real and not a well-meaning hoax.  Until then I don't believe it.",1117929600,78,4208,4.616734143049933
2294727,1,B0009JFDFO,"Sue Rubin is a 26-year-old woman with autistic disorder whose life story is told in ""Autism is a World,"" an Oscar nominated short documentary.  During childhood, Sue was also diagnosed with mental retardation and assessed to be functioning at about the 3 year old level.  Her parents and therapists subsequently began to use Facilitated Communication with Sue.  Facilitated Communication is a controversial technique in which a 'facilitator' holds the arm of a person with autistic disorder while she/he types on a keyboard.  In Sue's case, one of her therapists holds the keyboard while Sue types.  Sue's verbal skills are limited (she says `later' quite a bit), so the words that are produced via her Facilitated Communication are narrated by Julianne Marguiles.

Unfortunately, Facilitated Communication has been the source of great controversy and simply has not stood up to scientific examination; in fact, an official resolution has been adopted by the American Psychological Association (APA).

""THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that APA adopts the position that facilitated communication is a controversial and unproved communicative procedure with no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy""  (This information is provided at the APA website - search for ""Council Policy Manual: M. Scientific Affairs"").

Sue's story is certainly interesting, as she has obviously made enough progress that she's able to live on her own with assistance and even attend college.  She also seems to have amazing parents who love her.  However, it would be misleading to assume that she is typing all of the material in the program that is attributed to her.  Not once was Sue shown typing more than a few letters in a row by herself.  I'm concerned that the film may provide false hope to people whose loved ones may have autistic disorder, particularly given that the documentary does not present the other side of this controversy.  If you watch this documentary, please check out some of the scientific research on Facilitated Communication.",1117929600,55,2040,5.314641744548287
2294728,5,B0009JFDFO,"After viewing this program I was very impressed.  People often times think that autistic people are mentally retarded.  This film proves that theory is a myth and that there is hope for autistic children.  From what I understand autism is a neurological disorder and I think that is why they make the strange facial expressions and sounds.  Sometimes they do that just to soothe themselves because they can't deal with certain feelings the way ""normal"" people do.  I thought this film was excellent and will give people insight on autism.  We need more documentaries like this one that will demystify this disorder.",1117843200,14,615,4.980392156862745

But I help out in his special school and see all kinds of autistic kids, including some like her.  What is so completely amazing is that this woman acts and looks as if she has the mentality of a 2 year old, but is an extremely intelligent, highly-sensitive person inside!  While I've heard of cases where children, once able to communicate via a sort-of-typewriter, showed that they ""are in there,"" I've never heard of such an extreme case!  Sue Rubin says that her real life started when she was 13 yrs. old and given the communication device.  (She had tested at something like 23 on her IQ test.)  The communication device helped her organize her brain, and she found that she was not only able to communicate VERY effectively, but that she had apparently absorbed information all along.  She now tests at 136 IQ points and is a college student, and has written several articles about autism.  But she STILL looks very retarded, and it is surrealistic to see someone running around a room like a small child, babbling and making very strange faces, and to realize that she is someone very different inside.

2294768,5,B0009JFDFO,"As a professional in the field of autism, I hope reviewers here without clinical training and education will exercise restraint in making generalizations about Sue Rubin and AAC that are unduly harsh and insensitive.

It's important to understand what augmented communication is and is not, and what is meant by the addition of having a facilitator as Sue Rubin uses.  Augmented communication takes several forms; from pictures and symbols to signing to electronic devices such as keyboards or voice generators. For anyone who can't speak, these devices are effective and have been empirically validated among other disabled population studies for many years.

If the AAC user is physically unable to access a device because of motor problems- as some autism clients as well as someone with cerebral palsy or other PDDs might have - then a facilitator can help guide and direct the manual use of the AAC. This might look something like ""hand-over-hand"" guiding -for example, if the client's hands shake or have low motor tone.

The controversy with using a facilitator arises when the facilitator is typing or operating the device him/herself or answering questions for the client to then type in. Then, clearly the client isn't actually doing the communicating. Good facilitator training usually corrects this problem. In the case of Sue Rubin, sh is not pretending and she is -as many with autism are- of normal IQ and high intelligence.

That said, clients with autism can have problems with certain types of cognitive processing where they need help from a facilitator in understanding.  To the lay person, this is puzzling and it seems illogical. Why for example, can a particular client do complex math but can't count change? Why is another autistic client's memory exceptional for facts and figures but he has trouble in some areas of reasoning?

When we see these incongruences in client functioning, particularly among those using AAC with facilitators - the casual observer might think the facilitator is filling in the gaps with their own answers. I do not see that in this case of Sue Rubin but it has happened with some facilitators. Again, good training is key, as is the use of the most appropriate and least restrictive use of AAC tools.

Parents will I hope, approach AAC with the same optimism but careful consumer awareness and education that is necessary when exploring any avenue of help for their child.",1184544000,7,2426,5.0475

I work as an instructional aide with children who are labeled severely autistic.  I just returned from the Autism Society of America Conference in Phoenix and attended a seminar led by Sue Rubin.  I didn't connect the dots that this was the same young lady until I walked in and saw Sue getting ready to present.  She had prepared a typed ""speech"" which was read aloud via computer device, explaining her life history.  Then after that questions were given to her from the audience and we WATCHED her type very eloquent and sometimes sarcastic answers without someone assisting her hand.  It did take some time for responses and her mother answered other questions while we waited.  Sue was definitely typing her own personal answers. Her aide verbally helped her concentrate, but was NOT typing her answers as we sat there.  Let's support each other and not bring each other down. Yes, in the past some people have misused Facilitated Communication, but that does not mean we need to bring down this form of communication when used properly that gives a voice to those who do not speak verbally.  Best wishes to Sue as she seaks out a career in advocacy!",1184457600,4,1268,4.7272727272727275
2294789,5,B0009JFDFO,"This short little film really goes a great job at taking the viewer inside of the life of Susie Rubin.  Even though on the surface she looks and acts mentally retarded, as we come to know her through the film, we come to see that she's pretty much a normal autistic person.  She was considered to be retarded till the age of thirteen, but after she was diagnosed with autism, given an IQ test, and introduced to facilitated communication, she really came out of her shell.  Though she doesn't have Asperger's, the highest-functioning form of autism, she is still very intelligent and articulate.  A generation or so ago, before all of the breakthroughs in educating and treating people with autism spectrum disorders, it would have been considered impossible for a woman like Sue to attend college and do very well there, nor to be able to enter the workforce as she plans to do, being an advocate and counselor for others with autism.  It's amazing that this intelligent articulate person was able to be reached and brought to near-full potential after having been untreated and considered at the level of a two year old for 13 years, that her brain hadn't atrophied from lack of stimulation and the proper treatment.  Although, as anyone familiar with autism spectrum disorders knows, most autistic people do have remarkable intelligence, even if it's in just one area, an intelligence that one doesn't often see in ""normal"" people.  Susie admits that she does contribute to the image of her being retarded instead of autistic by constantly carrying around plastic spoons and zoning out while playing with them in the water, and knows that she doesn't need to do this, but says that the spoons are like her security blanket.  Is that any less rational than a non-autistic person who might constantly wear a lucky piece of jewelry or carry around a lucky penny in one's pocket even though s/he knows s/he doesn't need to do this?

Even in spite of all of her progress and capabilities, however, we also see how Susie sometimes feels overwhelmed or trapped because she can't always fully express herself and does have limitations in what she can and can't do.  Her friends and caregivers, as good as they are, also can't deal with all of her frustrations, as evidenced by their seemingly angry and annoyed reaction when she wonders why she should have to suffer just because they're leaving her soon, as though she didn't have the right to feel abandoned and crummy and it were unreasonable that she used some rather strong language when she raised this issue that obviously was very important to her.  And as for the naysayers who are convinced this film is some sort of propaganda, we see over and over again throughout the film that Susie is typing on her own.  She only needs the other person to hold the typing device for her.  No one is holding her hand or finger or doing the typing for her.  Facilitated communication has brought so many autistic people out of the darkness and into the light, enabled them to finally express themselves and communicate with the rest of the human race, unburden themselves of all of the things they had been dying to get out their entire lives.  It has done for them what Braille did for the blind, what Sign Language did for the Deaf, and what the finger alphabet did for the blind-deaf--allowed them to experience the joy of expressing themselves and being understood and communicated with in return, instead of being considered unreachable and stupid just because they weren't able to communicate in the ""normal"" way.  Of course there may be those who are unscrupulous enough to have abused facilitated communication, but the facts speak for themselves, that there are far more success stories than there are stories of fakery.  My only complaint about the film is that it's only 39 and a half minutes long.  As good as it is and as much ground as it covers in that relatively short amount of time, I just wish it had been longer so we could have gotten to know and understand even more about Susie and her world.",1172016000,4,4057,4.7304964539007095
2294790,5,B0009JFDFO,"""My name is Sue Rubin. I'm 26 years old,"" begins this moving 40-minute documentary where all the horrors as well as talents of this brain disorder are revealed. Originally cataloged by psychiatrist Bleuler in 1912, such qualities include the essential feelings of oddity and aloneness felt by Sue which slightly improve as her brain evolves, through the help of a keyboard, that dictates her thoughts, as well as the  life-saving help she receives by her constant support system, and a 24/7 compassionate aide.

It's bad enough to be born with a mind that works unlike any other, but Sue's physical appearance is also an anomaly. Her immense courage and family support has propelled her out of her house and into the world at large where she ventures daily, hurtling obstacles impossible for the uninitiated to appreciate. She lives by herself with her paid companion and attends college where she is matriculating in history.

To call her heroic is an understatement, as is her mother's comment that seeing one's child so burdened is heartbreaking. Yet, making use of massive government funding and newly available technology, Sue finds joy and meaning in her life and serves as a true inspiration to others in her situation.

2294792,5,B0009JFDFO,"I'm absolutely appaulled by the negative reviews written about this documentary. My nephew has autism and shares some of the behaviors Sue Rubin and the other autistic people in the film exibit. It is clear to anyone that has first hand experience with people with autism that this documentary is authentic.

Additionally, my sister-in-law's mother assists a child with a communication device. Not only does this child use the device with my nephew's grandmother, but with all whom she communicates with. There are several examples of this seen in the film. A number of people hold up the device for Sue to communicate with, not just one caregiver with one point-of-view. Sue is clearly and thoughtfully spelling out her sentences... as is the child my nephew's grandmother works with.

The communication device is controversial because it has been abused in the past for personal gain by scholars and caregivers. Nonetheless, this should not take away from the tools value. In fact, the documentary isn't about the tool, but it's about the struggles and successes of an autistic person to communicate and attempt to live a full life. This is what should be learned and celebrated from the film.

Very little is known about Autism... but one thing is clear. Sue is making choices for herself. I don't believe that can be disputed, and does offer hope for all autistic people. This documentary is well worth seeing.",1165104000,6,1414,4.983050847457627
2294793,1,B0009JFDFO,"facilitated communication is highly controversial, and i'm suspicious about it for a few of the reasons listed below.

1. If Sue can type so easily with the aid of her facilitator, maybe she could type just a little less fast and a little less accurately on her own.

2. The facilitator held and moved that small keyboard at all times. Imagine if someone was holding a tiny keyboard for you and moving it around, even slightly, would that help you type? No way! The facilitator doesn't always know what letters I want and would be moving it opposite of the direction I needed to go some % of the time. No such problems were visible in this show.  A fixed keyboard should be the easiest way to type, or maybe a keyboard with a different design, one with extra large buttons so that precision motor control is not needed.

3. This is a nice miracle story - the miraculous story of Sue coming alive with the aid of a facilitator. Not only did she come alive, she came alive almost instantly and completely, scoring 133 on an IQ test just months after a facilitator was provided. Where was the long struggle, the learning curve, the things that everyone has to go through. Dream selling is the hallmark of quackery.

4. If one disregards what happens on the keyboard, all of Sue's other behavior (playing with water, holding the spoons, responding like a 2 year old to commands and smiles, very limited highly repetitive vocabulary) indicate a severly mentally handicapped person.

It wouldn't take much to convince me that Sue was a genuine miracle, just one shot of her alone with a keyboard (of any size) responding sensibly to a few questions. Too bad the movie makers don't have even 60 seconds of something like that.",1165017600,12,1719,4.619672131147541
2294794,1,B0009JFDFO,"I thought the documentary was biased in showing facilitated communication as almost miraculous in how it can help people with Autism communicate.  One of the co-producers of the film was Douglas Biklen, who was one of the first advocates of facilitated communication.

To say this film has nothing to do with facilitated communication is silly, because the whole point of the film is that Sue may be capable of much higher levels of thought than might be readily apparent.  The entire basis of this assessment is what she appears to type on the keyboards.  Certainly, people with disabilities can use alternative means to communicate.  But when Stephen Hawking is typing a message, the keyboard is in a fixed position and nobody is ""helping"" his movements.  There would be no debate about if these were really Sue's thoughts if in the film they would have just let Sue type by herself without holding either her arm or the keyboard.  Nobody could fault her parents for wishful thinking, but scientists should know better.

For any parents who wish to see a more impartial documentary on facilitated communication, I would suggest the PBS Frontline episode ""Prisoners of Silence.""  The transcript from the show is on the PBS website, free of charge.

Facilitated communication is an example of the ideomotor effect.  People can unconsciously move their hands in a meaningful way when they gesture.  Similarly, two people can place their hands on a Ouija Board and the pointer will spell things out without either person intentionally moving it.  Yes, you are moving the pointer, but you don't realize you are moving it, just like you don't normally think about hand gestures while talking.  Sadly, this same effect can allow well-meaning assistants to helpfully, but unknowingly, move a keyboard toward the next letter to be typed by an Autistic child.  The Frontline documentary shows well how this effect can be tested.",1165017600,8,1920,5.031645569620253
2294795,5,B0009JFDFO,"The documentary changed what I thought about Autism.  It makes me search more to understand what is it.  I feel sorry to see a healthy mind locked in a disabled body with no control on facial or body expression.

Sue used facilitated communication in the film.  I also see some autistic patients use similar device/pda to communicate with their parents in the film.  Controversial does not mean unreal.  It may not work for some, but it works for Sue.  You can't rule out Sue just because facilitated communication is controversial.  You can't rule out Sue after an IQ test, doctor's visit, high school and college.

Not every Autism case is the same as Sue, but this film should bring more attention and understanding on Autism.",1164585600,3,729,4.768

2294797,5,B0009JFDFO,"I saw this film when it originally appeared on TV twice.  There were a few good points that I got out of it.  One was that the medical field is now responsibly reevaluating its long standing position on autism/retardation.  In other words, the kids that they used to think were retarded and autistic, may not have been retarded- doctors just didn't know how to test visually for IQ back then.  Another good point is that there is still hope when a child is autistic and hasn't gotten intensive treatment super early at age three.  This poor gal got productive treatment when she was a teenager and she advanced.  Still another good point was that she has a great support system which aided her progress.  Most importantly, you can't always judge a person's potential and you can't give up trying to help them.  I must say that I was a bit shocked at so many bitter comments directed at this film.  I don't think people can write an objective review if they are that bitter and torn up inside.  A truely interested person should give the film two viewings a few days apart and think about it for a while.  I feel that the film is genuine and deserves the praise it got from the Academy nomination.  Judge for yourself with an open mind.  I found it very hopeful.",1153526400,6,1261,4.478070175438597
2294838,2,B0009JFDFO,"People with autism have communication difficulties based on the severity of their autism.  Sue Rubin and her alleged use of Faciliated Communication (FC) remains open to discussion and questions, lots of questions.

Ms. Rubin was diagnosed with retardation at the age of 3 and spent years in special programs.  Sadly, she does appear to be cognitively delayed - her physical appearance and behavior lends itself readily to that assumption.  This is not to say that she is, but her delayed development included does support that finding.

I take issue with the statement that autism is a ""world;"" sadly, for too many generations the misperception about people with autism inhabiting their isolated worlds has proven costly.  For the most part, people with autism want to communicate as that is an innate need and want to be a part of what others are doing, but lack the social and/or linguistic tools to make it work consistently.  I am tired of the claim that people with autism are ""in another world;"" that kind of thinking reinforces negative stereotypes about people with the condition and dodges the underlying causes for the behaviors.

I have seen Ms. Rubin on television with her facilitator and many was the time when it looked as if the facilitator was doing all the typing and all the work for her.  Ms. Rubin's verbal skills appear to be quite limited and that adds to the question of the veracity of FC.  The story closes on an upbeat note with Ms. Rubin enrolled in college courses with her facilitator at her side.  However, Ms. Rubin cannot live independently and requires many services and a lot of help in basic needs, such as dressing, housecleaning and shopping.

At this time, FC has not been proven scientifically; it remains question of great debate and speculation.  In some reported instances, FC has been uncovered as the work of the facilitator only.  That is not to say this is the case in re Ms. Rubin; it is to ponder the question.  The American Psychological Association website also upholds these doubts about FC and so do many experts who have specialized in autism and other communication issues.

In watching Ms. Rubin, she does not appear to type independently; the few key strokes she makes are not the length of the highly sophisticated sentences her facilitator ""reads"" for her.  I do worry that this is a Feast of Dreams/Illusions that holds out false hope.  For anybody who has watched this documentary, please do some research on FC as it remains a questionable method.",1152230400,10,2510,4.852112676056338
2294839,1,B0009JFDFO,"One thing that I had a major issue with was the way that she continually spoke of autism, it utterly reeked of the fact that she undoubtably had been told all of her life that being autistic was wrong and that being non-verbal was synonymous with retarded. The other major issue I had with how much she was shown playing with water, I think it was overdone. I barely got through it, I only watched it out of morbid curiousity with the knowledge that it would probably irritate me and I was right. I think perhaps that I was quite lucky not to have been diagnosed until my twenty-second year.",1152230400,8,591,4.381818181818182
2294840,4,B0009JFDFO,"For a more complete description of the story and characters of this documentary, read what other reviewers have already posted.  My review isn't about the film's story, but about what the film taught me.

This documentary presents the paradox of being both deeply flawed and exceptionally gifted.  It would be shallow to say that Sue Rubin is a brilliant woman trapped in a disabled woman's body.  It goes beyond that.  Sue's spoon fetish, her attraction to water, her speech difficulties, and her behavior all make her appear to be retarded.  Some would say that these retarded tendencies mask the real Sue.  That is not the case.  The retarded Sue is the real Sue just as much as the intelligent Sue is the real Sue.  This apparent contradiction challenges the way we view others, especially those with disabilities.  It can be difficult to accept this unified duality of blemished excellence, so much so that some are disturbed by the very idea, and others doubt whether Sue is for real.

Personally, I thought it was beautiful.  In the weeks since I saw the film, I have often found myself thinking about my own strengths and weaknesses in terms of the film's lessons.  Sue has learned to accept her situation and herself.  She grows where she can, even though there are many challenges she will never be able to overcome.  She doesn't deny her struggles, nor does she pretend to like them, but she has the strength to accept them.

I'd also like to touch on facilitated communication.  This documentary is NOT about facilitated communication.  The film does nothing to advertise FC.  It makes no suggestion that FC should be used more widely, does not assert any statistics about how effective FC may be among the autistic population, and does not imply that you ought to be using FC with your child.  Yes, FC played a huge role in Sue's life, but those who fixate on FC as a myth are unable to see the film for what it really is.  Those who dismiss Sue Rubin's story simply because there is a keyboard on screen are just as blind as the people who believe every jumble of letters produced by a non-verbal must be poetry.  Let me repeat, this film is NOT about FC.  If you've got a problem with FC, get past it long enough to figure out what else the film has to offer.",1145491200,20,2274,4.588089330024814
2294841,5,B0009JFDFO,"I know Sue Rubin and I have watched her move from a person who began using facilitated communication to a person who types independently, despite severe autism. Her story is not the made up wishful thinking of her parents and educators, but a real story about a real person. If you doubt Sue's proficiency and success with facilitated communication on the road to independent typing and communication, just visit her web site, email her and arrange to meet her and see for yourself. Unfortunately in the field of autism Sue's existence is very troubling to those who believe that ""what you see is what you get"" and that anyone who looks and acts like her must be retarded-Sue's success challenges the so called experts to look at their knowledge base and reassess what we thought we knew. The people who do not want to do that, who only want to quote from one book or article to another, tend to hide behind their so called expertise. Not one expert or professional who has met Sue has walked away with the belief that she is not who she claims to be. She has proven her proficiency to her local school district, Whittier College, her physicians, autism experts at UCI and UCLA and in Boston, and she has been an expert witness in court cases in which other people with autism have fought for their rights to communicate. Sue's story is worth hearing. It might be your child's story. If you have a child with severe autism, you owe it to yourself to hear what Sue has to say.",1134518400,25,1475,4.52808988764045
2294842,5,B0009JFDFO,"As an indvidual on the autism spectrum myself who wasn't offically diagnosed  until the ripe old age of 30, I was wowed by this movie.:-) Sue Rubin is a woman of brilliance and determination who, while being quite signficantly affected by autism, has managed to work _around_it by the use of Facilitated Communication. Without FC, she would not have made all of the progress and accomplishments that she has achieved, so before we poo-poo FC, we need to give it a chance. It was because of this avenue of communication that Sue was able to get ahead and attend college and to be the person she is.:-) She still has autism and will always have it, but Autism is a World proves that one _can_live with autism and have a happy, successful, fulfilling life. Autisn is not the end of the world, it is only the beginning. As an individual on the Spectrum, who has been included in regular classrooms and work situattions for most of my life, as one who has had lots of love, help and support, and as one who wanted to keep on growing and changing, I can attest to that. So instead of punishing the autism and thowing the baby out with the bathwater regarding Facilitated Communication, let's give this wonderful communication technique and all individuals with autism the benefit ot the doubt. We must, before we do anything else, presume competenc. This movie makes that point beautifully. It's a winner!!",1131148800,5,1400,4.691056910569106
2294843,1,B0009JFDFO,"If you're not interested in using common sense, move on to one of the reviews giving a very positive review of this DVD. For the rest of us wanting to be realistic, read on. I too bought into FC for a number of years. But eventually, it becomes almost a cult, and the world is broken down into ""believers"" and ""non-believers."" If you question anything about FC, you become a non-believer and are no longer accepted in their world. You may think I'm just jaded. I've lived more autism than most. I worked in the field for 20 years and met 100's of individuals with autism. I also have a son with severe autism. I've seen some individuals who obviously can FC, but they can also print and write short sentences. It is physically impossible to write poetry, etc if you're not looking at the letters and at the same time have no reference point of relatively touching or locating the correct letters on a keyboard. This is what comes out: ""ciicme ice caewossd cjare."" I typed that using an FC-type method. It's garbly-gook, but a true FC believer would say that I typed something poetic that really means something like ""click me in ice, caring would in a jar"" and would have some deep autistic/poetic meaning. I don't have to pretend that my son has some deep poetic, Bob Dylan-like ability to write to find a purpose and love for him. Step back, live in the real world, and love and enjoy your friend/family member with autism for who they are, not who we would pretend for them to be.",1129248000,30,1483,4.476014760147602

2294845,5,B0009JFDFO,"My friend borrowed the DVD from the local library hoping to learn more about autism, as I have a 9 year old daughter with severe autism.  She wanted to watch it with me so I could answer questions and give my views.  To both of our surprise, the movie wasn't just another ""what is autism? 101""!

The movie is a documentary about Sue Rubin, a non-verbal autistic woman who's life was changed by ""facilitated communication"" when she was 13.  Using a key-board helped her to make sense of the ""noises"" that had made no sense to her before.  In just months of hard work, she was able to learn and could communicate her thoughts and feelings. Rubin says, ""before I could communicate, I was considered a nonperson."" . . . Her I.Q. went from 29 to 133!

I am sure there are many who doubt the truth of this movie.  As for myself, I am a believer!

Autism is as varied as you and I, there are many similarities, but not everyone with autism experiences the same symptoms or conditions or to the same degree.  My point being, we all have different learing abilities and styles, one size does not fit all.  Not every person with autism will benefit as radically from ""facilitated communication"" as Sue did.  She was not ""cured"" from autism.  But was given the key to communication and learning.  Another person's key may be ABA, another therapy, or diet.  You don't know until you try it.

Sue Rubin's documentary is a wonderful film.  I reccomend it to EVERYONE, not just those touched by autism or another disability.  It gets the point across that you cannot assume that someone is not intelligent because he or she can't talk.""

2294846,5,B0009JFDFO,"I think the film is absolutely incredible, but I feel the need to first address the doubts shown by several of the other reviewers.  I just came from a 3 day seminar, attended by 20 people, to learn about Facilitated Communication.  15 of the people were teachers/educators and 5 were parents of autistic kids(including me).  I must admit that I was originally quite skeptical, but there is no doubt that Sue is actually doing the typing herself.  Her aides (she has several and new ones keep hiring on as old ones leave to do something else) do not hold her hand when she types.  They merely hold the keyboard so that it is as the proper height and angle for her.  They are working on finding or making some kind of stand for her, so that she won't always have to have an aide.  However, she tires easily and slumps further and further down into her chair as she types, and a human aide is able to accomodate this.  Also, she seems to need to ""ground"" herself every so often by leaning her head against the aide.

I was not only an audience member, but got to actually sit with her while she worked with my friend's 2 young sons.  She also interacted with my 8 year old son, who is fully verbal, but he took a instant dislike to her because she opened his bag that he had sitting on the desk.  Thus, this was not a fruitful meeting for him.  However, I do feel that I am able to say, without any doubt, that Sue is ""for real.""

Having said that, I found this seminar rather upsetting.  I expected to find that my friend's 2 non-verbal boys would experience a sort of ""rebirth"" in being able to communicate.  They were, in fact, thrilled, and were actually typing things like, ""I can spell"" and ""I can spell too.""  I could see that the facilitator was not forcing their hands, because she just placed 2 fingers under the boys' wrists.  Also, she asked one of the boys what his address was.  He typed it himself!  As I had registered the family for the seminar, I know that their address was not given to the seminar.  (I don't even know their actual address, myself, and they are unlisted in the telephone directory.)

So why did I find this upsetting?  Because, even though many of these people were able to communicate, they were still very autistic, with all the strange things that can go with that.  One wouldn't type any answers that contained the letter ""A.""  Another acted completely crazy (scary, actually)and mentally retarded, and he would only type about food.  While they were certainly better off in being able to communicate, by no means were they ""regular people just trapped in a dysfunctional body.""  Many of them still had very peculiar ways of looking at things, had serious behavior problems, were afraid of anything new, were uncooperative, and more.  And the autistic adults had all sorts of emotional baggage from having spent many of their formative years in state hospitals for the insane.

Nevertheless, I think this documentary is brilliantly done, and is an extremely important source of information for parents who have no hope.  That was the case of my friend with her 2 sons, ages 6 and 9.  It was as if she and her husband thought there was very little brain function at all.  They certainly loved their boys, but they expected less from them than you would of a cat (let alone a dog!)  It was only after 2 years of hounding them to try something, anything (!), that I saw this film and made them watch it.  Now they see that their boys are actually quite intelligent, and are thrilled to be able to communicate their needs.  For that, they, and I, will be forever grateful to Sue Rubin.  She is responsible for changing the lives of that entire family and, I'm sure, many others.",1127952000,15,3713,4.4992526158445445
2294856,5,B0009JFDFO,"Bravo to all the pioneers who listen to and support people who have Autism.  They are breaking the barriers of silence that limit acceptance and inclusion.  Sue Rubin and the producers of this documentary are among those pioneers.

I seriously doubt that those who try to debunk this movie and its author, Ms. Rubin, understand what Autism really is.  I hope that an increased awareness of apraxia, along with its related conditions as manifest in Autism, can become more widely understood through more attention being paid to the voices of those who experience this condition.

Can the person typing be manipulated by the facilitator?  Well, perhaps some could who have been conditioned to ""behave"" and follow authority figures at all times. One essential rule taught to beginning users is to not allow that to happen.

This film is a precious portrayal of a woman's humanity, her struggles, her dreams, and her indomitable spirit.  I highly recommend watching it again and again.",1123977600,10,981,5.049689440993789

This documentary was well-made, but very narrowly focuses on this one individual's weaknesses/strengths and the one method of increasing communication for this individual. Many (most?) ASD kids/adults are not mentally retarded, are not non-verbal, are not living in half-way houses, do not have a team of personal aides, etc. Where are their stories?

Facilitated communication developed a bad rap a few years ago and no doubt there were people who abused it and spoke their own thoughts and not those of the disabled person, still, there is enough evidence that shows it's extremely beneficial to non-verbal autistic people.

I wish that Sue didn't feel self conscious about her spoons, her spoons are nothing to be ashamed of, people who treat her badly or think badly of her because  she is autistic should be ashamed of themselves.

I hope to see more quality documentaries about the lives of autistic people, Sue has one perspective and there are thousands of other perspectives out there that haven't been given a rightful hearing.

2294861,5,B0009JFDFO,"This film about Sue Rubin is all truth.  Sue started out typing with support, but now can type without anyone touching her arm. She is an amazingly intelligent young woman.  My son Sean Sokler has met her and her family, as have I, and we are the better for it.  Sean just graduated from George Mason University with

Dean's List and double major. His life somewhat parallels Sue

Rubin's life, but he does not have the ideal muscle tone like she does. Luckily, he has had support from over 90 adults, and has passed messages many times.

 Sean's IQ went from 18-141, much as Sue's score went upward like a rocket in the space of days after her IQ testing with support of her typing hand.  I wish the best to Sue, and hope that her screenwriting will continue.  Since a person with autism is now in 1/68 families, we need to have more movies about and with persons who have autism.

Get this DVD. The film is essential for any person who wishes to understand the difficulties of being autistic and trying to communicate on the same level as one's intelligence dictates.",1120867200,11,1069,4.492227979274611
2294862,1,B0009JFDFO,"One reviewer said that ""Autism Is A World"" is ""incredible."" Indeed. If it seems too good to be true, then it probably is. First, of all, Sue Rubin is not the one communicating. Although no one, at least in the film (which everyone must remember is a carefully edited film) is physically moving Sue's hand, if you watch carefully, you'll notice that at no time does Sue actually hold the communication device. It is always being held by a facilitator who has worked with Sue for years. Moreover, the facilitator ever so slightly moves the keyboard and, as another reviewer pointed out, we only see a few letters at a time being typed (sometimes from behind so we don't actually know whose hand it is), then the facilitator interprets. We are told that Sue wrote the screenplay as well as speeches that she purportedly gives at conferences, but we never see her actually sit down at a table with the keyboard on the table typing long sentences.

As for Sue being a college student, well, any professor who gives her a grade without knowing for sure who is actually communicating, is violating ethical responsibility.

And there are many little things that viewers of the film should question such as how Sue can type speeches and screenplays but cannot punch 911 on a telephone in case of emergency. And how is it that someone supposedly that intelligent cannot brush her teeth or close the front door of her apartment without assistance?  And, contrary to claims, Sue does not live on her own; she has 24-hour care. And notice that in the film Sue never initiates picking up the keyboard and typing but she quickly closes it up and puts in down. It looks like she complies with the facilitator, whos is always the one who instigates the ""typing,"" just to get it over with, hardly the behavior of someone dying to communicate.

It is all part of the illusion created by her parents and the FC vultures, like Douglas Biklen, who stand to gain, both financially and professionally, from this film.

Biklen and other promoters of FC reject the 50 or more controlled studies that have shown FC to be bogus and deny that it can be scientifically tested. How convenient.

The real tragedy is that during all these years that Sue, who, by the way is obviously not autistic, but mentally retarded (with some kind of chromosomal disorder) has been exploited by her parents and others, she could and should have been receiving appropriate education.

And any one who thinks that you just have to watch the film or see Sue in person to believe that it is real doesn't know the first thing about the scientific method. If we take that approach then we'd believe in UFOs, ghosts, ESP, and so on.

I understand parents' desparate desire for their autistic kids to be normal, but they're not and it should be okay; parents should accept their children for who they are and provide the best education possible.

If you watch ""Autism Is A World"" knowing that Sue is a low-functioning mentally retarded woman who is not communicating, then it is a very sad film indeed.",1120867200,22,3049,4.673507462686567

While I have heard about the controversies regarding facilitated communication, the film makes it obvious that Sue Rubin is indeed communicating her own thoughts and desires. The camera repeatedly follows Sue's hands as she types  showing that she is not being guided. It's obvious that Sue has overcome tremendous physical difficulties in order to communicate and her story is an inspiring example of what the human will can do. The film is the unique story of one person's struggle to make sense of her world and it gives the viewer a rare glimpse of what autism is like from the inside of the disease.

My son is in an intensive ABA program at home as well as a year round school program at one of the top private special education schools in the country.

8061911,5,B0009JFDFO,"I am very glad to be able to get a copy of this DVD.  It is an excellent story which shines a light on the mystery of Autism.  Although it includes terms no longer accepted (i.e., retarded), it IS Sue Rubin's story.  I am a Speech-Language Pathologist in a public school and I work with children with special needs and I have often referred to this film to encourage others (e.g., teachers, parents) to see for themselves that every child is unique and that what you think you see is not the whole picture.",1411948800,,506,4.361702127659575
8061912,4,B0009JFDFO,"This is a great story of someone struggling with autism who actually has the gift to express what is going on deep inside.  I work with autistic children so she did put some things into perspective, which I'm thankful for.  If I can suggest a movie about Autism:  I really enjoyed ""Autism: The Musical.""",1395446400,,303,4.574074074074074

8061914,5,B0009JFDFO,"A beautiful story, very well written and great video footage. Inspiring story to make you wonder about others you have met unable to communicate verbally. I would recommend parents of autism children to view.",1388534400,,208,5.147058823529412
8061915,2,B0009JFDFO,"The video describes the life of Sue Rubin who is autistic but has other developmental problems, thus not the typical autistic child for those interested in learning more about the disorder.  The use of the keyboard to facilitate language communication raises several questions of doubt. Sue always has an aid with her to cue and help her.  This gives a picture of false hope,in my opinion.  Sue R. is enrolled in colleges classes and the segment showing her interacting with the professor in the classroom looks terribly staged.  No professor would spend that much time with one individual in such a large class.  Also, we are led to believe that she is very gifted intellectually, but yet, she is not able to function without help at home.  She needs 24/seven assistance and care.  I have a grandson who is three years old and recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.  This video was no help to me at all in understanding autism.",1384819200,2,939,4.788819875776397
8061916,2,B0009JFDFO,"Got to watch a library copy.  Having read the negative reviews here on Amazon.com, I must concur with many of the points.  The ""miraculous"" transformation from severe mental retardation to near-genius was not persuasive.  We get only images of printed reports touting the newfound brilliance, yet we see a woman lacking a basic grasp of the events surrounding her.  Regurgitating data (definition of ""Sharia"" in the classroom) is not indicative of intelligence nor contraindicative of mental retardation.  Indeed mentally retarded people are frequently gifted in rote memorization.

We see questionable use of the ""facilitated communication"" device.  As many here commented, I too noticed that the assistant was not holding the device steady and, consciously or not, quite possibly influenced the outcome via ideomotor effect ala Ouija board.  The examples of Suzie's communication shown in the video are a far cry from the movie dialogue as read by the narrator.  (Perhaps it was edited for time, but one particular example shows Suzie pressing about three buttons and having long and complete words.  The device showed no special shortcut keys, so what gives?)  The creators of this movie went to great lengths to portray Suzie as a trapped woman with ""neurotypical"" thoughts and words.  Sorry, I'm not buying it.

Autism is a World does not resemble any sort of scholarly work on Autism, but it does look a lot like a commercial for FC devices.

Even if you accept at face value the claims made in this movie (a tall order), it remains a poor piece of work, if for no other reason than that it focuses on a single patient.  I had hoped to come away with a better understanding of Autism, a disease routinely criticized for its ambiguous definition.  ""Loving Lampposts"" is a far better movie - more objective with every bit as much of a personal touch.

One final thought.  Autism is quickly descending into a sort of religion, almost a cult.  Many of the glowing reviews on this movie reflect this disturbing trend.  Its becoming a subculture replete with quackery, denial (""my child is just different""), heresy (""How dare you question the Autism Orthodoxy"") and the attendant pseudoscience.  Tell people your child is retarded and the reaction is ""I'm sorry"".  Tell them your child has Autism and ""You're so brave"" and ""Its ok, that's just a different way of being"", or ""You're not alone"".

Our present impotence in dealing with Autism has clouded the division between the victims, who need our support, and the condition, which should be dispatched to the land of Leprosy and Smallpox as soon as science will permit.

8061917,5,B0009JFDFO,"Helped my students understand what living with Autism is.
Watched this DVD when I was finishing up my NYS Teacher Certification.
It was a better way to understand this label than just reading about it.
When I stared training foreign teachers in Inclusion Education I knew
this DVD will be a greater help than any book would be.",1340582400,,327,4.655172413793103
8061918,5,B0009JFDFO,"I'm late coming to this forum, but having owned the Autism is a World DVD since soon after it came out, and having loaned it to many (very impressed) people, I realized I need to purchase another.  As a Speech/Language Pathologist with almost 18 years' experience with Autism and Facilitated Communication, I've had varying degrees of success with FC with dozens of people with Autism and have found Autism is a World to be a wonderful and exciting way to show many truths about autism.

Unfortunately, there are lots more ""common sense"" MISconceptions about autism out there than there are understandings of just how inconceivably complex and misleading this condition can be.  How do I know that?  Because I get my understanding (hopefully, constantly growing) of autism from people with autism.  Now there's a novel idea!  Seems simple enough, but I can assure you that you need to do more than read ""scientific studies"" to understand autism and FC.

Share this video with others, read some of the many wonderful books written by, or in collaboration with, people with autism.  If possible, seek out individuals who use FC.  Seeing may not be believing, but holding someone's hand or arm and feeling that person push YOUR hand toward the chosen letters (only after some coaching by a well-trained facilitator) is an amazing experience.  FC isn't for everyone, but it opens the world to some.",1272153600,,1394,4.944206008583691
