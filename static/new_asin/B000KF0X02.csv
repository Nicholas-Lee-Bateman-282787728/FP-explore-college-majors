8156212,1,B000KF0X02,"I purchased these for my Leadership class that I teach. David has good points; however, almost every time he finishes a sentence, he says 'right'. It was so irritating that I can't even listen to his concepts.",1298851200,,209,4.675675675675675
8156213,4,B000KF0X02,"I found the Four Factors a great introduction to Leadership for my semester-long course for our aspiring college campus student leaders. In spite of the presentation being a ""talking head-type"" David is a great speaker and can hold the attention of our young freshmen and sophomores with ease.  His presentation helped our 60 college-age student to better operationally define the terms ""leader"" and ""leadership!""

I highly recommend its use for similar basic leadership training workshops and seminars!",1200096000,3,503,5.51948051948052
8156214,5,B000KF0X02,"This DVD is truly a great find! I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for direction on how to become a great leader. The stories and examples used are entertaining and inspirational!

8156215,5,B000KF0X02,"This DVD, and the companion book, are both well worth the money.  Given the dearth of leadership DVDs available, Dr. Rendall has really done the genre a favor.

I have had the privilege of attending one of Dr. Rendall's presentations live--he is very intelligent, witty and a clever storyteller.  His command of the material is thorough, but the best part about the presentation I attended was its practicality.  Dr. Rendall's telling points were easy to remember and apply because they were entertaining, simple, and concrete.  This DVD captures these memorable qualities, and I highly recommend it.",1199750400,3,600,5.208333333333333
8156216,5,B000KF0X02,"This video is full of insight and information on leaders, leadership and personal effectiveness!  The speaker does a good job of integrating leadership history with personal leadership.  This is a fresh new look at practical leadership application.  As a college professor, I will be using this video in my management classes to inspire others to be ""Effective Leaders.""",1199664000,5,370,5.344827586206897
8156217,5,B000KF0X02,"This is an excellent DVD that clearly presents the Four Factors outlined in Dr. Rendall's book.  You will definitely benefit from this presentation.  Gifted with a dynamic presentation style and sense of humor, David Rendall will make your time worthwhile.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1199577600,5,286,5.311111111111111
8156218,1,B000KF0X02,"This has to be most boring speaker I have ever seen as mentioned by another reviewer. I purchased two of his DVDs but after watching this one I decided to return the other one(GROW! Ten Strategies for Maximizing your Leadership Potential), he has no energy what so ever. People looked like they were not interested at all in his seminar. He has no sence of humor.  I just simply DO NOT understand how he has done hundreds of seminars around the country. Just horrible do not waste your money.",1199491200,2,492,4.52808988764045
8156219,2,B000KF0X02,Boring speaker but uses leadership theories of the great leaders. Was going to use in class but students will fall a sleep.,1198713600,3,123,4.636363636363637
8156220,5,B000KF0X02,"I have been through many a video whose bent is to train us on the status quo, but this video, I have to say is excellent. I found myself taking copious notes; and enjoyed, and learned quite a bit.

I identified with the idea of the oxygen masks(on the plane when cabin pressure drops, you put on your own oxygen mask before you help others), not only for the idea of me-first leadership, but for the fact that leadership has to be grounded in individual perspective, not a cookie-cutter one.

Also, that to be a leader, you need to be competent, not an expert. I tend to push myself to extremes to try and prove how skilled I am, but there have been many times when that interferes with my thought process as a leader... So, not having to try and seem an 'expert' is a solace.

Overall, very, very effective and thought provoking. What I would suggest is to loop it back into specific training for your own company.

8156221,5,B000KF0X02,"This is a truly fabulous DVD seminar. Dr. Rendall does a great job of clearly and simply presenting a topic that I have found to be challenging at times. How do you define leadership? And once you define it how do you know how to develop it? These questions and more are answered in this session.

Don't miss out on an opportunity to learn! I would defiantly buy it again!!!",1191283200,7,374,4.3428571428571425
