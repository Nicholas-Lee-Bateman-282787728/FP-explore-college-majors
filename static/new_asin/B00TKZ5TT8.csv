8702173,1,B00TKZ5TT8,It was good until the Michael Brown story which distorted the trueth by painting him as a martyr. Investigations showed that he was aggressive before and during the episode. You can't rewrite history especially with a story that affected race relations as I have never seen in my lifetime. Shame on you!,1497398400,,303,4.846153846153846
8702174,5,B00TKZ5TT8,"If you haven't :walk"" the path, then you will never understand the journey and realize why we can't repeat the past.  Watch with understanding and accept that history must never repeat itself.  Thank you.",1496448000,,204,4.970588235294118
