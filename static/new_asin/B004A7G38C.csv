4295588,5,B004A7G38C,"THE PINK PANTHER has an endearing quality. THE PINK PANTHER is a film richly textured with well-defined characters, plot, dialogue, production design and location photography. David Niven, Peter Sellers, Capucine, Robert Wagner and a brooding Claudia Cardinale all give very fine performances which seem to remain fresh and vibrant to this day. Images of the Cortina ski lodge, the costume ball, the wild car chase and especially the animated Pink Panther are part of the iconic cinematic contribution from this film and Henry Mancini's theme and score are equally audibly iconic and indelible as well. This is an eternally endearing film that introduces Inspector Clouseau as Peter Sellers established that character for all future generations to come.

Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards are at their Best in A SHOT IN THE DARK. The Pink Panther (Inspector Clouseau) films were so popular that once seen you will never forget them. Whether it was the animated image of the Pink Panther or images of Peter Sellers' bumbling yet likeable screen personification of Inspector Clouseau or Henry Mancini's unmistakable theme you never forget. A SHOT IN THE DARK has somehow come up short with the younger fans for no good reason other than its title. It does not say ""Pink Panther"" yet once discovered A SHOT IN THE DARK is a true gem. A SHOT IN THE DARK is a great example of sophisticated slapstick (screenplay by Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty based on plays by Harry Kurnitz and Marcel Achard). A SHOT IN THE DARK has Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Kato, which THE PINK PANTHER did not. A SHOT IN THE DARK focuses on Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. It is really more character based and driven than THE PINK PANTHER. In many ways A SHOT IN THE DARK is much funnier. It really defines the character of Clouseau a good-natured inspector who just cannot see the forest for the trees. George Sanders is once again brilliant in another similar role, the type that he perfected throughout his career. This time he is the very sardonic yet stately Benjamin Ballon one of Clouseau's suspects. The cast also includes Elke Sommer (the most obvious suspect to the audience), Tracy Reed, Graham Stark and Martin Benson. The opening shot (shots in the dark) and the nudist colony scenes are great examples of Blake Edwards' direction at his best. Production designer Michael Stringer and cinematographer Christopher Challis visually replicate the idea of shots and murder taking place in the dark or at least in places where passions run uncontrollable. A SHOT IN THE DARK has a much different look than the invigorating and opulent images found in THE PINK PANTHER. Henry Mancini once again delivers a very good score. A SHOT IN THE DARK's main title theme is very good but has been greatly overshadowed by THE PINK PANTHER theme. But can you blame it? A SHOT IN THE DARK is somehow in a league of its own yet it spawned all the great supporting characters found in the subsequent films which we all came to love and couldn't get enough of. A SHOT IN THE DARK was the foundation for what was to come and made the world of Inspector Clouseau so enduring and endearing yet there is something very different and special about this one film. It is somehow etched in a time that can never be replicated. To really enjoy it try to place yourself back in that time.

THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN is a bit of a dichotomy. It starts off extremely humorous with a base of some sense of reality. However, as the film progresses its drifts into a fairytale like world that is quite offsetting initially, creating some Freudian comedic nightmarish goings-on that are definitely a visual feast for the eye. This film does contain some extremely good scenes, but it almost comes off as a very strange dream by the finale. Herbert Lom really comes into his own in this film. He is outrageously funny and he eventually steals this film. Mancini's theme and score is once again on target and extremely innovative as he introduces a very distinctive melody for Clouseau apart from the Pink Panther Theme. This is a fun outing in all.

Each of these films are distinctly different and funny in their own right. For me, A SHOT IN THE DARK is the best of these three. These three Clouseau films more or less make up a trilogy because they represent the best films of what became a series. Nostalgic stuff I suppose.",1337731200,3,4427,4.76171875

4295591,5,B004A7G38C,"great seller, videos, well, return of the pink panther is great.  the others, like bond movies but slow.

Purchased for my kids preteen, and revenge is good for families wanting simple with some depth but at it's core, just funny, while two other movies in the 3 pack were too slow.  Those appear aimed focusing on those wanting scenery, remonance and deeper plot (not bad for some but for us, we wanted silly pink panther).",1325289600,,424,4.626666666666667

8419588,4,B004A7G38C,"An excellent starter kit for Sellers or Clouseau franchise fans.  'The Pink Panther' (3 1/2 stars), the first and glossiest-- although also comedically tamest-- in the series, is more of a cosmopolitan mystery/romance with only a smattering of classic Clouseau antics.  'A Shot in the Dark' (4 1/2 stars) is the second and arguably best of the five Sellers/Edwards Panthers, packed with memorable sight gags and clever dialogue (compliments of 'Exorcist' writer William Peter Blatty) while retaining a good bit of that old-Hollywood luster.  'The Pink Panther Strikes Again' (4 stars), the fourth entry chronologically (1974's hilarious 'Return of the Pink Panther' is not licensed to MGM/Fox), is the most absurd as far as story and characters go, serving mainly as a vehicle for pure Sellers silliness (and he is very, very funny in it).  Contrary to Amazon's above-stated specs, however, there are only two DVDs in this set: a one-sided picture disc for TPP and a flipper containing ASITD and TPPSA.  Prints appear to be those remastered for release in 2004 and package offers no bonus content of note.  Still, a solid 4-star value overall.",1352332800,4,1143,5.118279569892473
