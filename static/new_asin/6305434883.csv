7889300,5,6305434883,"I've trained for some years in Matayoshi Sensei's kobudo system, mostly with Kimo Wall, one of his top students. So much of the following comes from personal experience.

Other reviewers have described the contents of this tape, so I won't repeat them.  Suffice it to say that Matayoshi Sensei (he did not like the title ""Master"") was unquestionably one of the greatest martial artists of the 20th century.  He was a living link to the ancient Okinwan tradition, a tradition that has been all but obliterated by rampant commercialization of karate and kobudo.  Tsunami produced this tape near the end of Sensei's life, when he was on his last American tour. The production is top notch, a bit glossy but always tasteful.

Matayoshi Sensei viewed katas as living dynamic things, and as such they were subject to change.  His interpretation of kata was always evolving. This is very unlike the ""carved in granite"" approach seen in other systems.  So what one sees on this tape might not be exactly what is being taught today, but believe me, if the source is authentic it's all Matayoshi kobudo.

Sensei also believed for most of his life that kata needed to be taught in person. He steadfastly refused to record his art, except for a special show done for Japanese educational TV.  That tape is vastly superior in content to anything done by Tsunami, but it is nearly impossible to find.  Anyway, he recorded the Tsunami tape after he'd had a stroke.  Whether he was concerned about his legacy or just not thinking clearly, we will never know.

Interestingly, the hatkutsuru kata contained on this tape is not authentic.  I have it on very good authority that this kata is just a hodgepodge of techniques from various hakutsuru kata.  After the tape was released a young American asked to demonstrate the taped kata for the Master.  He did so, and Matayoshi Sensei just laughed at him and walked away.  In the end Sensei stayed true to his principle of only teaching the real thing to those who had earned the right to learn it.

Buy this tape if you train in Matayoshi style kobudo, or if you'd just like to learn about the legacy of truly traditional Okinawan martial arts, a legacy that may soon disappear forever.",1167523200,,2216,4.729166666666667
7889301,4,6305434883,"The Cassette is very informative for a kobudo enthusiast. It is indeed a great experience to watch the Grand Master matayoshi performing all the weapons. The picturisation is well taken,using 3 cameras in 3 different angles,and it is edited well. The weapons covered are Bo,Tonfa,Nunchaku and Eku. Bo session is well covered with details of basics,hand grips,stances and the kata,Choun no kun,sakugawa no kun,shushi no kun and bo kumite. But there is no basics shown in the case of Tonfa,Nunchaku,&Eku. The Katas are recorded in 2 speeds;slow motion and full speed.
 This is a wonderful cassette with a few glaring omissions. In the Bo Kata Choun no kun ,a few steps are missing. After the initial 4 steps,the fifth step is gedan harai uke and gedan nuki Bo. This is missing in the kata. Iam sure a sensei of the caliber of Hanshi Matayoshi would not be responsible for the omission. I trust you will make the necessary rectificatios,else this may mislead aspiring Kobudoka.",1028851200,4,974,4.939024390243903
