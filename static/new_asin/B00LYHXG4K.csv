8669039,1,B00LYHXG4K,"Unless your a die hard fan, and want to watch them clowning around for several hours, this is not for you. There are some good songs, but no concert. Buy, though the never, much better. It is a concert with all their best hits. And a movie around it. I bought both, and gave this one away. It's a year and a half of boring!! Only reason for 1 star is it has a few songs, but it's not worth watching whole thing for them!!",1495238400,,421,3.9647058823529413
