3176126,5,B0017WI5OI,"This is one of about 10 DVD's we constantly replay in our home.  We bought the book and love it, too.  What we love about the DVD is that is is 90% music and 'stop shot' pictures from the book itself, with 10% slow, deep, male, British narration.  It gives you enough time to think, and the words are ponderful  :)  The pictures are as sweet as the story line.  The theme creative.  You will not be disappointed in wither the book or the movie.  In fact, they are a beautiful complement to each other.",1249776000,6,501,4.2

8267639,5,B0017WI5OI,"There are a very few animated films that I watch more than once. Abel's Island is one of these. It's a smartly adapted film and director Michael Sporn and his team, including the great animator Tissa David, not only do a great job translating William Steig's illustrations into animation, they also honor the story and it's intentions.

While it might be wishful thinking on my part, it would be wonderful if many of the directors and writers who steer today's animated blockbusters would take a look at this film and see how to create a film, whether adapted or not, that doesn't pander to the perceived low expectations of today's audiences. For all the cleverness of these blockbusters, many of them, sadly, lack the ability to make us truly care about their stories in a way that isn't manipulative and filled with false sentiment.

Watch this film. It's beautiful.",1350604800,,869,4.825503355704698

8267641,5,B0017WI5OI,"My children first saw ""Abel's Island"" on the PBS fable series, ""Long Ago and Far Away.""
They wish to have the entire collection for their own children.  We were lucky to find this, and have enjoyed it.  The DVD arrived in new condition with great quality.  We are currently looking for the other episodes as well.",1311206400,,313,4.553571428571429
8267642,5,B0017WI5OI,"This is a kids story with a love story in it's core. Great for children and adults alike. We borrowed this from the library, and after watching we just had to have our own copy. This is a wonderful adaptation of the book by William Steig, Abel's Island. In the story a mouse named Abel gets stranded for a year on a deserted island, and learns to survive while realizing the most important thing in the world to him is the love of his wife. My 9 year old son loves to watch this story, since it has plenty of adventure to keep the kids interested as Abel has to learn how to survive. He is a spoiled rich mouse, who does not know how to fend for himself, yet he has become a Robinson Crusoe of sorts. He fights off an owl determined to eat him, and never stops trying to find a way off the island. Abel teaches himself create fire, to find and store food, build shelter, and to make pottery to eat with. He has to make use of his time and he finally learns he has an artistic side which brings him to sculpt life size images of his friends. His perseverance is incredible against all odds and fears, he never gives up trying. His strength lies in his never ending love.

The animation is very good, this is not simply still pictures from the book, yet it is quite faithful to the illustrations from the original book by the same name. Believe it or not, the lead character is voiced by Tim Curry. The original book by the same title the film is derived from is a very beautiful story, and appeals to the kids as adventure while a parent sees the true romance of the separated husband and wife who love each other so much. The book that the movie is sourced from is of course a wonderful story, it a very important addition any library for kids or adults. A good film to watch before bedtime, I highly recommend!
The Dancing Frog story is a nice addition, they did not have it on the VHS edition.",1302480000,5,1895,4.206043956043956
