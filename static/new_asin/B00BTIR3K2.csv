8573669,5,B00BTIR3K2,Scarlet Angel was released in 1952. A wonderful film starring Yvonne De Carlo and Rock Hudson. So fun to watch these great stars entertain us in the story of a woman pretending to be someone she's not. Fans of Yvonne De Carlo and Rock Hudson will like this the most.,1463356800,,266,4.34
