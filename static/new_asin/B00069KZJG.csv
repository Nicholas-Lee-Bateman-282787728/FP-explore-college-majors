This was way back in the 1970's when they were shooting rockets into space & I think almost near the time sending the (1st. Man to the Moon). At any rate...let's get back on track; boy just thinking back makes me feel ancient!

I recall watching this film on TV somewhere several years ago and was very impressed with it. And ever since then I've been wanting the Video. But then DVD popped up and decided to wait til it came on DVD--and waited and waited and waited. Hey, how much of a hint does one need...someone? I'm getting tired of waiting. And I bet there are some other people who'd like to see Shy Boy on DVD as well; but be that as it may, I'm sure soon enough someone will get the hint and wella our wish will come true.

It's a great film and I'm sure it will be worth the wait to be on DVD format. Final word? Every horse lover should watch Shy Boy.
