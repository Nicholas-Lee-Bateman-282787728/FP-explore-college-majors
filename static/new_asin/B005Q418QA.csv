4857949,3,B005Q418QA,"I was intrigued to see this film, first because I respect Paul Muni as an actor, and second because this is a film dealing with early Canadian history, which is uncommon.  The film was fairly entertaining, with a few moments of intense drama, for example, when a European is executed by other Europeans to stop an Indian war.  But I felt that Muni played his role too much for laughs, which weakened the plot.  Vincent Price was passable as Charles II, and Gene Tierney was lovely but a stereotyped English lady.  I didn't really learn much about the development of the Hudson Bay Company, which has played such a big role in the history of Canada.  All-in-all, a modest effort.  Fellow admirers of Paul Muni would do better to watch his performances in ""The Life of Emil Zola,"" or ""Juarez,"" (my personal favourite).",1356739200,,816,4.671328671328672
4857950,2,B005Q418QA,"In the mid 1600s, a French Canadian fur trapper (Paul Muni) convinces King Charles II (Vincent Price) of England to back an expedition to not only gather thousands of fur pelts with the full cooperation of the Indian populace but to colonize Hudson's Bay. Based on the life of Pierre Esprit Radisson (yes, the very same who has a chain of hotels named after him in the U.S.), whose idea was it that the formation of the Hudson Bay company would make for an interesting film? Well, it doesn't so, of course, the film is highly fictionalized with incidents that never happened to hold one's interest (to no avail). Adjectives don't exist that could fully describe the awfulness of Muni's hammy, eye rolling performance with his awful Pepe Le Pew French accent. To say painful is an understatement and Laird Cregar as his trapping partner isn't far behind. Which leaves us with John Sutton and a horribly wasted Gene Tierney to provide the pallid romantic interest. Directed by Irving Pichel (THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME). With Nigel Bruce, Virginia Field, Morton Lowry and Ian Wolfe.

The Fox DVD from Spain is an adequate B&W transfer in English or dubbed Spanish with optional Spanish subtitles.",1349913600,,1191,4.8669950738916254
4857951,5,B005Q418QA,"I fondly remember watching this movie on Long Island's television station WPIX back in the '50's when you could see an entire movie without hundreds of commercial interruptions.  Seeing it again via DVD only served as a reminder as to what a good actor Paul Muni was.  This was not one of his more memorable films but it was one that I very much enjoyed watching him act in.  I would recommend this movie for people who do not complain that the picture is in ""glorious black and white"" or that every two minutes something is not getting blown up.  This movie was made in the day when they wanted to tell a story through dialogue (that you could understand what they are actually saying) and good acting.  It was good to see Vincent Price in a role before he went into horror movies as well as Gene Tierney and John Sutton at the beginning of their careers.  I am so glad that 20th is finally opening up their archive vaults and hope to see more movies eventually released.",1347321600,21,972,4.402234636871508

4857955,3,B005Q418QA,"Hudson's Bay is a 1940 black and white comedy adventure tale set in 1667 in Canada, providing a fanciful account of the settling of Hudson's Bay, 1.5 million square miles between Quebec and Manitoba, and the creation of the Hudson's Bay Company.

Paul Muni (1895-1967) stars as a French trader who is responsible for setting up the company.  Muni was nominated for an Oscar his very first film, ""The Valiant"" in 1929, and 6 more times - ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932), ""Black Fury"" (1935), ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" (1936), ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (1937), ""The Last Angry Man"" (1959). To be nominated 6 times over a period of 30 years is remarkable (and unmatched) itself, but this achievement is all the more meaningful when you realize that Muni made only 21 films, and furthermore, he wasn't nominated for ""Scarface"" (1932) or ""The Good Earth"" (1937) in which his performances were also exceptional.

Larger than life Laird Cregar (1913-44) often played villains in films like ""I Wake up Screaming"" (1941) and ""The Lodger"" (1944) but he could also play effectively in comedies like ""Charley's Aunt"" and ""Rings on Her Fingers"" (1942). My favorite Cregar performance was as Sir Henry Morgan in ""The Black Swan"" (1942). In this film he plays the comedy sidekick to Muni, and this is another one of his very good performances.

Gene Tierney (1920-91) is in the film so briefly it's hardly worth mentioning. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Leave Her to Heaven"" (1944) and appeared in more than 40 films, the most notable of which were ""Tobacco Road"" (1941), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Razor's Edge"" (1946), and ""The Left Hand of God"" (1955). She was known for her escapades with famous personalities like Tyrone Power, Ally Kahn, and JFK.

We tend to think of Vincent Price (1911-93) for all the B horror movies he made in the 50s and 60s, especially the first 3D film ""House of Wax"" (1953) and the marvelous ""The Fly"" (1958). But Price was extremely versatile, and did comedies (e.g., ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"", Egghead on the TV series ""Batman""), period pieces (e.g., ""The Ten Commandments"", ""The Three Musketeers""), and film noir (""Laura"", ""The Long Night"", ""His Kind of Woman""). Here he plays King Charles II.

Nigel Bruce (1895-1953) is best known as Dr. Watson in all 14 of the Rathbone Holmes films. Bruce had quite a distinguished career apart from the Holmes' films, appearing in many British films like ""Treasure Island"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934), ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). Bruce plays the man who ultimately forms the company.

The film was directed by Irving Pichel (1891-1954), an actor director who is better known for his acting. He directed 37 films between 1942 and 1954 and two of the actors in his films (Monty Woolley in ""The Pied Piper"" and J. Carroll Naish in ""A Medal for Benny"") received Oscar nominations.

The top grossing films in 1940 were ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Rebecca"", ""Boom Town"", and ""Santa Fe Trail"". ""Rebecca"" won for best picture, James Stewart (""Philadelphia Story"" was best actor, and Ginger Rogers (""Kitty Foyle"") was best actress. Other notable films that year were westerns like Spencer Tracy in ""Northwest Passage"", Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan in ""The Westerner"", and Errol Flynn in ""Virginia City"", comedies like Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in ""My Favorite Wife"", Cary Grant and Roz Russell in ""His Girl Friday"", and W.C. Fields as ""The Bank Dick"" and with Mae West in ""My Little Chickadee"".The NY Times'

Bosley Crowther said the film ""is as static and ponderous as a bale of furs, and the only breath it is filled with is that which the characters expend in endless talk."" If that wasn't sufficient, he - ""added there is little or no fast action in the film, no accumulation of suspense, no propulsion toward a crashing climax.""

If you're looking for history, look elsewhere. But the film has lots of comedy, some adventure, great photography of rural Canada, and interesting subtext about the inherent merits of a country like Canada vs. European countries, a subtext that probably wasn't lost on people in 1940 as the world was at war and North American was still on the sidelines.

It's also one of the best performances by Paul Muni, who manages to keep his French Canadian accent throughout the film. Coming from Fox, one suspects the film was intended for Tyronne Power who was the star in several historical pictures  - ""Lloyd's of London"" (1936), ""Suez"" (1938), ""The Black Swan"" (1942 - from that period. Indeed, some of the early fisticuffs were a little unusual for a Muni film, but he (or shall I say his double) handles it well.

Bottom line - a fun adventure film that fans of Paul Muni will surely enjoy.",1314576000,7,4741,4.852722772277228

8482919,4,B005Q418QA,"As of November 26, 2016, there are 15 reviews posted under this title.  All 15 concern a Paul Muni movie of the same title as the 1959 television program which I streamed via Amazon Prime.  The first episode is all that is available at this time.  The program, filmed in Ontario, starred Barry Nelson and George Tobias.  It was a pretty good western with a different setting and story idea than most.  The only false note I detected was Nelson's crisp, clean white shirt which stayed crisp and clean through the end.  Ok.  It's black and white, maybe the shirt is some very, very pale color.  Doesn't matter.  It's made of some kind of miracle fabric which instantaneously sheds dirt and wrinkles.",1480118400,5,697,4.647540983606557
