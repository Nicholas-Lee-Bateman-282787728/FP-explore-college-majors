1622872,5,B00005LP3O,"I'm such a huge fan of Cynthia Rothrock. This movie was action packed, funny, and her phsyic ability to the touch. Don't I wish I can have that ability. The most amazing part of this DVD was the interview with Cynthia Rothrock. To see her explaination of certain scenes was nice. But one thing that bugs me was her semi nude body in a romantic sexual scene. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful but I'm not used to seeing her in those scenes, But she pulled it off. In my opinion I gave this movie 5 stars, just because it had it all:) And I would love to train to fight like her.  Just to stay in shape and to take care of my self when nesacerry. But this is my opinion you'd have to see it then agree, if you agree with every one, or just put in your two cents in a review.:)",1266278400,4,776,4.006451612903226
1622873,3,B00005LP3O,"I'm pleased that ""Sworn to Justice"" tends to get appreciated as a good mid-career adventure for Cynthia Rothrock. As the only solo vehicle she'd produce within an eight-year stretch, it's fitting that Rothrock herself would point to this as one of her personal favorites. As such, it's definitely worth picking up for fans and general karate aficionados...but it's not perfect. I'm almost sorry to say so, knowing how much effort went into this and how different it is from the rest of Rothrock's work, but there are a few major drawbacks that pull the rating from a solid four stars down to a high three.

The story: Following a robbery, a psychologist (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-O-Brien/dp/6305232725/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China O'Brien</a>) gains a psychic power that allows her to track the criminals and uncover a massive plot of police corruption.

The most apparent strength the film has is its impressive cast list. No other Cynthia Rothrock feature has quite so many genuine actors of repute in its credits: Tony Lo Bianco (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-French-Connection/dp/B0006GANN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The French Connection</a>) as the shady detective, Walter Koenig (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001DHXT6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>) as Janna's colleague, Brad Dourif (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Two-Towers/dp/B00005JKZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Two Towers</a>) as the murder suspect, Mako (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sand-Pebbles/dp/B000059HAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sand Pebbles</a>) as Janna's martial arts instructor, and Mary Margaret Humes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawson-s-Creek/dp/B005CGI3ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawson's Creek</a>) as an attorney all converge to give this one a dramatic credibility that many other Rothrock flicks have lacked. However, the first major drawback is that this unique cast isn't fully utilized. Koenig, Dourif, and Mako are all restricted to only a couple of scenes, which may have all been shot in a day. And while it's genuinely cool to see Cynthia acting alongside name performers, they don't elevate the movie's quality as dramatically as one would hope: the roles of most of the stars could conceivably have been played by lesser-known players and still would have left similar impressions.

The action generally sticks to karate fistfights, and these deliver a mixed bag. Wanting to give the brawls some flair, Rothrock brought in Hong Kong choreographer Tak Yuen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaolin/dp/B005FQ1OOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaolin</a>) to wrangle the fights - the first time Yuen had worked on a U.S. feature. However, longtime American choreographer Eric Lee also contributes to the action, and while Lee has delivered some good work in the past, he can't hold a candle to Yuen. It's easy to tell which fights were choreographed by whom. Three of the film's half-dozen fights stand out: the duels between Rothrock and Kenn Scott (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-2/dp/B0000696I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2</a>) and Scott and Kurt McKinney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B009191EBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat No Surrender</a>) for their quality, and the scene wherein Janna thwarts a gang robbery for its unwelcome goofiness. The brawls seem split evenly between the choreographers, and because of this, I can only give the action content a 50% score.

Production values are on the high side, although the movie's not particularly flashier than other direct-to-video actioneers. Even though I don't think the psychic angle was fully exploited, the film delivers a special feature in Cynthia Rothrock's first topless love scene. I don't watch action movies to see breasts, but this is pretty unique, seeing as Rothrock had hitherto gone her entire career without removing her clothes. She gives them up for Kurt McKinney, who's a strange choice but does pretty well in his first martial arts flick in ten years. Rothrock and he have good chemistry, and I'm glad it was played tastefully.

Again, established fans ought to add this one to their collections, and folks who enjoy American martial arts films by default should give it a try. Despite its flaws, it's  still one of the more solid pictures the Kung Fu Queen has made in this half of her career, and deserves to be seen.",1240531200,8,4824,6.565149136577708
1622874,3,B00005LP3O,"The last 7 minutes of this dvd had blurred video, audio was fine, just blurred pixels. This is a quality control problem. Service was fast but product is faulty.",1210723200,,161,4.586206896551724
1622875,3,B00005LP3O,"Many good things about this movie make it better than many B grade martial art films, but unfortunately, there was just too little action for my needs and the pacing of this movie felt too eratic.

The story is definetly more interesting in Sworn to Justice than most martial art films, and the plot thickens nicely and has some surprises throughout.  The charcaters are ok, some are really good and some not so good, and Cynthia Rothrock has many up and downs throughout the movie.  Her acting can be pretty good at times, and then not so good.  The movie also stars Kurt Mckinnley (from No Retreat, No Surrender - about 10 years before this film) who does a ok job, though a little bland.  The villain is played by Kenn Scott, who also does an ok job.  The movie begins a little weird with Janna (Cynthia Rothrock) getting psychic powers from a fall that would normally kill someone.  For the most part, the movie feels lagging at times, but finally gets exciting about 3/4 through.

Unfortunately, there just wasn't as much action as I had hoped for.  The few fight scenes are pretty good, and my favorite was the fight between Kenn Scott and Kurt McKinnley.  A quick fight, only lasting 1-1/2 minutes, but exciting and very well done.

Just another average film overall, with high spots and low spots.  I also point out that the picture and sound quality is better than most martial art B movies.  Ok story thats fun to watch the first time, but after that you'll probably wish there was more action.",1177027200,,1504,4.567164179104478
1622876,3,B00005LP3O,"After reading an article about this film, I had wanted to see it for the last 10 years because of the fact that I hadn't seen the wonderful Kurt McKinney since 'No Retreat No Surrender', and liked Cynthia Rothrock after seeing her in 'China O'Brien'.

I wasn't dissapointed. Since being a fan of marital arts and martial arts movies, I liked this film a lot.

If you are a  martial arts fan, you will likely enjoy this movie.",1154736000,3,425,4.423076923076923

1622886,3,B00005LP3O,"The plot of this movie was to easy to follow. However, what I liked about this movie was, you have the star of ""No Retreat No Surrender I"" (Kurt McKinney) joins forces with the star of ""No Retreat No Surrender II"" (Cynthia Rothrock). The story was predictable and the direction lost track only but a couple of times. However, it showed Cynthia in a view worthy of a classy pretty lady who is also a weapon. My wife and I both liked this movie as the music score matched with the martial arts action and other scenes perfectly. Kurt's role could have displayed more action i.e. my reason and point for stipulating the direction loses track. Overall a good movie to watch and eat popcorn with.",1326844800,3,691,4.492063492063492
