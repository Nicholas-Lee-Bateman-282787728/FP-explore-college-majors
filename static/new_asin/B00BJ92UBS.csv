8641394,5,B00BJ92UBS,"An absolute Gem to find. This is far more than a documentary about two women taking up winemaking in their own private vineyard, it's a celebration of life. If everyone could find just a piece of the joy that these two have found, the entire world would be a better place. You can tell by watching the interactions with guests that this feeling is contagious. Magnificent country with beautiful people doing what they love, it can only make you smile.",1485043200,,451,4.65

""Nous avions souvent regard des sujets sur la vigne, le vin, les cultivateurs, les vendanges.

Celui que nous avons dcouvert sur les Cabotines est assez exceptionnel et different des autres.  C'est trs interessant.

Le plan technique est abord serieusement mais pas ennuyeux.

J'aime la chaleur et l'atmosphre du film.  Bravo  vous les filles ainsi qu'a tous vos amis""",1376265600,2,462,5.705882352941177

1 Feb 2013 by Julia Harding MW
Last week I was invited to a screening of a film about two women, Carole Leblanc, a nurse from Qubec, and her partner Jo Befort, a vet from Alsace, who have fallen in love with wine and have been making their own in southern France under Les Cabotines label for the last five years. They found and rented 4 ha of old vines - Syrah, Grenache and Cinsault - in Collias in the Gard dpartement and rent a cellar in the centre of the village, kitted out mostly with second-hand equipment. This charming film gives a very personal view of growing grapes and making wine, alongside their day jobs, helped by various gangs of friends when it comes to pruning and harvesting. It also discusses the question of becoming accepted as a gay couple in a small French village. There's plenty of insight into both the hard physical work behind every bottle of wine and their relatively unusual context. Lots of great attitude.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wine-Women-Friends/dp/B00BJ92UBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wine, Women & Friends</a>",1376179200,4,1166,5.240641711229946
