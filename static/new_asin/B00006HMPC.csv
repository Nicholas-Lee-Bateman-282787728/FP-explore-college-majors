1760290,5,B00006HMPC,"If you followed the popular book series or not, you will glued to the screen watching this movie.  I got it earlier (and cheaper) than most people because the store placed it out before the deadline, tomorrow.  You must watch it and then compare the quality of special effect, amazing plot, and superb cast to say the least.  Buy this one, it's worth every penny and more!...",1035763200,2,375,4.567164179104478
1760291,5,B00006HMPC,"For those who have seen the first movie, this is way better. Do not expect the book, but where LB left off this picks up and sails forward. The DVD is awsome and includes alot of cool extra's. I got my copy early and before the release have already watched it 5 times. There is so much in it that you will find many things missed the first time.
It has enough Gospel Message without being ""pushy"" so those that may be turned off by a preaching movie will still enjoy it. I cna hardly wait for the next movie.",1035504000,3,508,4.09
1760292,5,B00006HMPC,"I loved the first movie for its ability to reach out to anybody, both Christians and Non-Christians. An entertaining, realistic look at what the future holds for all of us. This movie is a great buy for anyone who is searching for the truth. The Left Behind movie is a great resource to share with friends and family. If this is a topic of interest to anybody I would also recommend Apocalypse - Revelation - Tribulation - Judgment Series by the same producers. Happy watching!",1035417600,,477,4.623529411764705
1760293,5,B00006HMPC,"""Left Behind II: Tribulation Force"" (LB II: TF) is the latest movie from the independent Christian Film Studio, Cloud Ten Pictures (CTP). I was recently provided an advance screener copy of the film and, in one word, I would describe it as ""excellent.""
LB II: TF takes place one week after the events of the first film in the series, ""Left Behind: The Movie"" (LB: TM) While that film focused on the events of ""The Rapture"" (the disappearance of all true believers from the Earth), this movie continues the story of those who were ""left behind.""
One of the things that is immediately apparent is the return of the entire cast from the first film: Kirk Cameron, Brad Johnson, Clarence Gilyard, Chelsea Noble, Janaya Stephens, and Gordon Currie. After compelling performances in LB: TM, their characters are incredibly solidified in LB II: TF. It would be difficult to see anyone else in those roles again. The acting is truly top-notch and the cast is to be lauded for their heart-felt and very real performances. These are not actors playing characters, these ARE the characters.
The pacing of this film is much different than its predecessor. This is not action-fare, it is great story-telling. Any of the qualms some may have had concerning the plot of LB: TM will be quite pleased with the tightness of the script. Much of this is the result of the decision made by CTP to divide the story of the novel, Tribulation Force, into two movies. This allows better concentration on the story, which is the mission of the Tribulation Force to spread God's truth to as many who will hear it. This involves a daring mission to Israel and the announcement by revered scholar, Rabbi Tsion Ben-Judah concerning the Messiah. Everyone has their part to play as the world enters the Tribulation Period. This story is played out beautifully on-screen.
And what about the story? How good is the adaptation from book to movie? Again, in a word, ""excellent."" As in all adaptations, there is some liberty taken, but we see many of our favorite scenes from the book brought to life. The powerful sermon of Pastor Barnes at New Hope Village Church, the early courtship and struggles of Buck & Chloe, the first meeting with the Two Witnesses (and the fiery aftermath!), the speech by Dr. Ben-Judah - all are presented in high quality.
The strongest point of LB II: TF is the unashamed presentation of the Gospel message. Again, anyone who may have been concerned with the lack of a stronger message in LB: TM will have no problems here. There are clear, reproducible conversions which are both powerful and personal. I was greatly moved by these scenes (even to tears).
Simply put, ""Left Behind II: Tribulation Force"" is by far the best Christian film I have ever seen. As entertainment, it's moving. As filmmaking, it's dynamic. As an evangelistic tool, it's potential is absolutely limitless. Cloud Ten Pictures has raised the bar yet again, and they are to be commended and applauded for this excellent film.",1032825600,83,2990,4.807766990291262
1760294,5,B00006HMPC,"Ted Baehr, of Movie Guide, is the most authoritative voice on Christian filmmaking and Christian values within Hollywood films. He was provided a rough cut of the movie (no music, no sound effects, etc.). Here is what he said: ""In my opinion this film (Left Behind II: Tribulation Force) is better than the first one... The evangelistic power of this film is awesome! Characters repeatedly come to Christ in powerfully acted and compelling scenes... Fans of the book Tribulation Force will be especially pleased with the film's faithfulness to their favorite scenes... I love it when dedicated teams of Christians make quality Christian films like Left Behind II: Tribulation Force."" ...",1032048000,32,687,5.198198198198198
1760295,5,B00006HMPC,"This is one of the best series ever written and I can't believe some of the negative feedback that's being posted.  People talking about how they thought this movie should be as big as Spiderman's or Star Wars special effects.  Come on, get real...How many independant movie companies out there can you think of that can afford over 100 million dollars?  None that I can think of.  I think what they did in special effects at the budget they had was an outstanding job.  Also the characters I felt were some of the best.  There are some great actors in there, just to mention a few (Clarence Gilyard Jr., Brad Johnson, and Gordan Currie who was perfect for the part of Carpathia).  I hope to see the entire series come out and I will be one of the first people to see each and every one.  We need more movies like this.  I highly encourage everybody to go and see it and to pay no attention to the negative reviews.",1031961600,31,915,4.3352941176470585

It is not even in the hands of the official reviewers yet!  How these people can say it is horrible is beyond me.  Further, folks, please be careful believing what you read.  You can learn more about this film and find out that it is going to have a limited theatrical release also.  Make sure the reviewer knows what they are talking about!  Check out the offical web site.  Having been on site of the movie, yes, this movie is going to be beyond anything that Cloud Ten has done yet!

1760336,5,B00006HMPC,I ordered this movie because my husband had never seen the left behind series and we are both movie lovers. It arrived quickly and was just as described. Kirk Cameron is a great actor in the left behind series and while there are a few cheesy bits this movie is pretty good for a budget film and is a good drama. If you've read the books or not I think you will like this film. I found that it is entertaining and a good christian family film about the end of times. Happy with this purchase and would recommend to a friend.,1460246400,,524,4.147058823529412

He's been down on his luck for a while so this was good to see. I think he should have ""left behind"" his toupee though because it looks so phony that it hurts an otherwise Oscar-worthy performance.

I hope that his wife Chelsea isn't disappointed in him. Sometimes, when you fail at one career you have to try another one like a God-based career. Which is what a lot of people who can't get work in Hollywood will do. I mean the bills still come in and getting hooked-up with an indutsry that doesn't have to pay any taxes is actually a clever thing to do. You don't even have to believe in God and you still don't have to pay no taxes.

Sometimes I think about Chelsea and how beautiful she is and my head starts to spin and my hands are everywhere and then it just happens! A spiritual eruption all over the place but mostly on myself and computer screen.

One of Kirk's best.",1448841600,,903,4.232558139534884

1760371,1,B00006HMPC,"I really wasn't sure what to expect of this movie. I enjoyed the books - they were a light read but I found the story interesting enough to stick with it for all 12 books. The first movie, the one with Nicholas Cage, was awful. So I didn't know whether this one would raise the game or leave me wondering why I bothered.

Sadly it was the latter. The first half of the book seems to have been skipped over. Kirk Cameron plays Buck Williams, a man who apparently managed to become a journalist known by name to just about everybody in the civilised world and yet who lacks even the smallest amount of charisma and turns into a giggling schoolboy when he sees a pretty girl he likes. Nicolae Carpathia lacks depth in a way that is unimaginable if he is truly the antichrist.

The spiritual aspects of it are desperately contrived, as seems to be the norm for things branded as ""Christian movies"". Needless to say the sinners repent just before death, people show a little token hostility to the message before seeing the light and changing their ways and curiously anyone offered prayer accepts enthusiastically.

Just to top it all the movie finishes with a group of people in church singing a hymn. There's nothing wrong with showing people in church singing a hymn - people up and down the country do just that every Sunday morning, but when the hymn isn't even over before the movie cuts to the closing credits it just finalises a crushing sense of disappointment at the realisation that I had wasted yet another evening watching a ""Christian movie"" that I'd be embarrassed to show my Christian friends and wouldn't dream of showing to a non-Christian.",1442016000,,1654,4.619047619047619

The movies are very choppy and don't go into elaboration about the characters and their inner conflicts, which is why the book's more successful. It helps you connect with each of them personally and isn't just an overall summary like the movie makes them to be.

For example, Rayford Steele is someone I find distant and a figure in the movie but in the book, I know him personally, understand his struggles and thoughts etc.",1430265600,,488,4.609195402298851

1760424,3,B00006HMPC,"Left Behind II: Tribulation Force is a direct-to-video Christian apocalyptic/thriller and the second of the trilogy that was based on the Left Behind book series written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. It tells a story about how four people of faith must take it upon themselves to be responsible for the salvation of humanity.

The story starts at the conclusion of the first film wherein millions of people around the world suddenly disappeared into thin air without any apparent reason. This placed the world into chaos. Nicolae Carpathia,the president of the United Nations and an international media magnate,steps forward to guide the different nations into this time of chaos. But television journalist Buck Williams know the real reason behind those disappearance as predicted from the Bible and he knows very well that Carpathia is an anti-Christ. It is up to Williams together with the three remaining believers - pastor and biblical scholar Bruce Barnes, airline pilot- turned-believer Rayford Steele and Steele's headstrong 20-year-old daughter, Chloe to save mankind.

This is an improvement as compared to the first film in terms of the film's technical aspect such as the action scenes and the sound. Also,the story becomes more interesting in the sense that four believers try to stop the anti-Christ into leading the world into a direction different from a Christian perspective. But as a Christian film,it is still lacking as it is more of a science fiction and an action film rather than than of trying to impart a good Christian message. The conclusion can be considered Hollywood clich rather than a believable Christian conversion.",1421971200,,1653,5.2105263157894735

1760504,3,B00006HMPC,"I've never read the books (I'm not into self-torture), nor have I seen the first film in the series.  I'm vaguely familiar with the whole ""Left Behind"" phenomena, but mostly through second hand sources, such as those awkward-turtle conversations with a co-worker that one sometimes finds oneself in.  You know, the kind that has you saying ""okay then...good luck with that"", because sometimes it's better to say nothing if you can't think of anything nice to say.  I basically watched this on Netflix on a lark.  It was one of those ""how bad could it really be?""  kind of moments.

Well, it was bad, really bad, and it really deserves one star, but I gave it a bonus star because I found it entertaining in a ""Battlefield Earth"" sort of way, and I gave it another bonus star because of the sincerity of the people involved in the making of it.  Paradoxically, that's what I found to be the most disturbing as well.

As the story picks up, presumably after the events of the first film, hundreds of millions of people have mysteriously disappeared off of the face of the Earth.  We quickly learn that they have been raptured up to Heaven, and these lucky souls (literally) are those who had already accepted the Protestant Evangelical Jesus as their Lord and Savior.  I think it's safe to assume from the tone of the film that this doesn't include Catholics or liberal Christian denominations, but it does include all of the world's children.  Apparently those who are too young to choose whether or not to accept Jesus automatically get a free pass into Heaven, which I suppose would make abortion a good thing, if one were to think about it logically.  But I think it's fair to say that logic doesn't play a very big role in the thought process of either the filmakers nor their target audience.  In fact, they seem quite proud of the fact that they don't use logic, wearing their stupidity as if it were a badge of honor.  Apparently the rest of us were ""left behind"" because God likes to torture humanity until we kiss His backside, at which time he'll still torture us with immeasureable suffering because HE works in mysterius ways and it's not our place to question Him.  Those who turn to Christ after the Rapture, which include all of the characters in the film, have to remain on Earth and suffer throuth the Apocalypse.  Apparently God's favorite game is ""talk to the hand"".  Die unsaved?  You get to spend eternity in Hell.  Don't like it?  You should have thought about that when you had the chance.  Unsaved prior to the Rapture?  You get to endure Hell on Earth, but at least you can still qualify for the Big Prize that's behind Door #1, because, He's a meciful God who LOVES you.

So how are things after the rapture?  Well, the Anti-Christ is the Secretary General of the United Nations, because nothing says EVIL like liberal notions like world peace, nuclear disarmament, and the nations of the world working out their differences through diplomacy.  And he's Russian, because, you know, Russians are all Atheist Commi-Socialists.  We know this because he proclaims that ""there is no God"".  I suppose what we're supposed to take from this is that Atheists and Satanists are basically the same, right?  Uh, no.  Atheists don't believe in a supernatural diety of any kind, and would find a Satanist's belief system to be as logically flawed as that of a Christian's.  But I digress.  After this anouncement, his first act as Secretary General is to create one world-wide monetary system, because apparently the world is in some sort of mass economic crises after millions of people disappear.  Of course, that doesn't make sense either.  With hundreds of millions of less people, one would think that there would be more real estate and natural resources to go around, making life more comfortable for those ""left behind"", but as I already noted, logic isn't this film's strong suit.

Other than that, things don't seem to be THAT bad.  All the characters live in nice homes and have well paying jobs.  Things seem pretty much the same.  One would think that the Apocalypse would be a little more Apocalyptic.  You know, fire and brimstone coming out of the heavens, famine, desease, mass murder.  I would even take a lack of clean running water.  Something.  ANYTHING.  Maybe the filmakers saved all that stuff up for the third installment, but I doubt it, given the production values on display here.  The characters even go to church openly.  You would think that at the very least that the Anti-Christ would be rounding the Christians up and sending them to concentration camps, but no.  But one only has to look at contemporary Christians to see why the filmakers did it this way.  Concentration camps aren't needed to convey the message of persecution, because Christians love to pretend like they're being persecuted already, when in actuality they don't even know the meaning of the word.

I don't want to give away to much of the plot because I personally don't apppreciate spoilers, but I'll suffice it to say that it is completely ruined by the overwhelming, unbiquitous presence of DEUS EX MACHINA.  Maybe it's not surprising, given the subject matter, but it's lousy story telling nonetheless.  It's simply unsatisfying (and lazy) on a dramatic level if the hero is unable to solve his problems on his own.  Here, problems are solved through a mere act of prayer, wherein God magically intervenes and solves the problem for them.  What's worse is the fact that millions of people come away from this thinking that's how the world actually functions.  Forget science and logic, which is based on observable, natural, and CONSISTENT phenomena.  Instead, we get treated to a world where things just magically happen, apparently upon the whim of a capricious diety who gets to change the rules whenever He feels like it.  Little Timmy's heart transplant is a success?  Our God is an awesome God!  Little Timmy dies?  Our God works in mysterius ways, and who are we to question His plan.  Either way, God get's a free pass, while the surgeons who actually performed the operation apparently had no part in it.  This failure on the part of the characters to function as if they existed in the real world results in some major plot holes.  Why doesn't Brad Johnson simply fly the Anti-Christ's jumbo jet straight into the ground?  Because according to Bible prophecy, the Anti-Christ gets to rule, that's why.  So why even try?  But if that's the case, why do anything?  Why even bother to get out of bed in the morning?  And why bother to pray, if the future is set and God has already decided everything that will happen, including knowing who will turn to Him and who won't, which sorta makes all those people burning in Hell for all enternity sorta INNOCENT, doesn't it?

It's a very interesting film is one wants to understand the mentality of millions of contemporary Christians.  To summarize:
1)  They don't believe in a universe that's built on natural law.  Basically anything goes, and prayer and blind obedience to biblical authority take precedence over personal initiative.  2)  This belief in a ""higher power"" in control of ""everything"", coupled with a denial of and guilt over their own natural drives and insticts, leads to feelings of helplessness and delusions of persecution, fueled by passive agresssion and a resentment of those who choose not to follow their (God's) rules.  3)  This leads to the creation of and the belief in eloborate revenge fantasies wherein the righteous are rewarded and the wicked are punished, such as the Book of Revelations and The Left Behind Series on which it was based.

In closing, I'm not an Atheist.  I would consider myself an Agnostic.  Even if the universe was somehow created by a sentient being outside of it, I don't see that alone is proof of either an afterlife or proof that such a being would be even mildly interested in us.  If I were a betting man, I'd throw my lot in with Azathoth, the Blind Idiot God.  Suffice it to say that I DON'T KNOW, and I'm okay with that.  Just because I don't know doesn't mean I'm going to accept every explanation that comes along.",1326153600,3,8155,4.744665718349929
1760505,2,B00006HMPC,"I wonder if the Kirk Cameron jokes on Family guy were inspired by these two films, or if it was simply Kirk being an outspoken and vocal Christian. I am sort of a Schizophrenic Christian. Sometimes I am feeling drawn to the spirit of Christian ideas and values, and then sometimes I feel like Christianity is nothing but hypocrisy. I know this makes me human. I know many Christians would say I need to get saved. Some would feel I am living in the flesh. Really, it's hard for me to know how I feel since I no longer go to any kind of church. I've had bad experiences which led to my dead end in the church.

That being said the first two Left Behind movies did little for me. The acting is bad. The actors are not very credible. The scripts are bad. It's very easy to see what a low budget the producers and actors had to work with. The movies try to deal with a global crisis but the films have a local aspect or perspective. Never was I lead to believe that the actors actually went anywhere. How did Kirk Cameron and others worship in very public places during the tribulation? With the Antichrist on the loose and in the flesh, when EVIL was prevailing all over the world, how were these CHRISTIANS worshiping in CHURCHES. The characters even wore CROSSES around their necks, or a couple did.

I appreciate the work and the effort put into the movies but as someone who is not in the church I have to say these films simply are not on a part with any modern film which has any sort of respectable budget to work with. The movies are sort of entertaining. The ideas are compelling but the actors cannot sell the ideas and they can't make them believable. When the one character in this last film came up saying that so and so ""just got saved"" it just sounded childish and silly. The characters have not SOLD the feeling of the SPIRITUAL WARFARE. There needs to be a lot of BELIEVABLE DISTINCTION and CONTRAST between these forces of GOOD and EVIL. Sure, the Kirk character seems like a WHOLESOME Christian, but he doesn't look like some STRONG man that GOD has used to TRICK the ANTICHRIST. And the ANTICHRIST has a REALLY BAD ACCENT. Come on!!!!!! What was the ANTICHRIST, RUSSIAN? What a put on and silly accent.

I'm sorry, I got rid of the first film and I feel the same will follow for the second. I know if I was hanging out with other Christians my age (50ish) that then I would be KINDER to these films. Christians ALWAYS SUPPORT the work of the lord. Fans of any BAND always SUPPORT the work of the band. Employees in a business support their employer and their company. But as someone not in the CHURCH I can say these films did little to steer me back into fellowship. They are just weak low budget Christian flicks.

Sorry, I've watched TWO of these movies now and they have left little impact on me, and I AM reachable. I am not SO far gone. I am able to recognize good acting and good scripts, and I know how a budget makes all things POSSIBLE or IMPOSSIBLE.",1324166400,,2977,4.329749103942652
1760506,4,B00006HMPC,"I'll say the same thing about this movie that I did the first one. In most movies based on books they unfortunately must leave out a lot of content, usually due to time constraints. Such is the case with Left Behind. I understand it and know there is not much that can be done. What can be done, though, is to make sure the right content is selected and that what is selected is put together in a good way that keeps the story coherent and the main message of the book intact. I loved the book (the entire series actually), but felt the movie seemed to not be as impacting mostly due to the content that was left out. Of course, maybe if I had not read the book first it would have seemed better, but I just did not feel anywhere near the thrill from watching the movie that I got from the books. That being said, I think it does still give a good message and can help people understand end time prophecies by presenting one plausible scenario. I would recommend the books in this series over the movies (all of them), but the movies are worth seeing even if they may not have the same impact. And of course I would say if you can get an unbeliever to watch with you (since it would be harder to get them to read the book) then it could definitely be a valuable tool in getting a conversation started about end times and man's need for salvation through Christ.",1324080000,,1361,4.218390804597701

1760518,5,B00006HMPC,"Have you ever wondered what the world would be like after the Christians are taken up to heaven at the time of the Rapture. Left Behind - the Movie was the adaptation of the first book of the best selling series - Left Behind. This is book 2.

Tribulation Force has our heroes, Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron), Capt. Raymond Steele (Brad Johnson), Chloe Steele (Janaya Stephens) and Pastor Bruce Barnes (Clarence Gilyard Jr.) uniting forces to go up against the Antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie).

Carpathia is creating a one-world government, currency and religion. He wants to convince the world that he is the Messiah and it's up to Buck and Ray to stop him - to get the message of the truth out instead.

Not in the book, but prominently placed in the movie is a version of Kirk Cameron's ""Way of the Master"" pitch trying to convert a friend of Ray's.

If you don't have time to read the book, this is a great concise retelling of the story and it gets the most important message across - if you don't believe in your heart that Jesus is the Son of God and your savior, you will be left behind.",1264118400,3,1107,4.465346534653466

1760520,3,B00006HMPC,"This movie is more character driven than ""Left Behind"" 1... and thats it's strength. The film makes one care about Buck, Ray, Chloe, and Bruce.

The ""covert"" mission Ray has as the Antichrist's personal pilot is tense. Rabbi Ben Judah's study of Messianic prophecy is compelling, as are the rag strewn prophets at the wailing wall.

Again, the film has to avoid seeming contrived or preachy. Using evangelical language (""Chris was just saved!"") will turn off the very viewers these films were intended to reach. I see some Christians who have reviewed this film like how ""unashamed"" it is as a witness for Jesus. They have to ask themselves this... are these films designed for an evangelical-Christian audience only? That would just be ""Preaching to the choir."" Instead, these movies have to take a softer approach, so as not to disenfranchise a larger audience.

Once again, the dramatic repentance and conversion scenes are cornballish. Bowed heads, tear streaked faces, etc. Playing up this ""moment"" of salvation is preaching to a very specific choir indeed.",1251331200,,1062,5.091954022988506

1760526,2,B00006HMPC,"Left Behind is based on the award winning multi-selling Christian novel extravaganda. The premise is that people (only true-blue Christians) are all taken away by God before all the bad stuff starts to happen on earth during the end times. Funny thing is that there are a significant amount of Christians who believe this stuff. Yes, their god will come down in secret and take all these good people away (leaving only their crumpled clothes as we know they will be nude in heaven)>

Ridiculous stuff, but could have made a half-decent horror movie out of it if they were so afraid of violence (though the bible is certainly R rated and above in places and should be unavailable to children).

The worst part of this film is Kirk Cameron's preaching to everthing that moves. Yes, he tells them that god will torture you forever cause you lied, stole a paperclip or lusted after a woman - that's the message. Why anyone would believe in such a petty god punishing people forever is their business, personally I find it's all a scary fairy tale, but...

As a film, quite entertaining, and the chick in it Stapleton is kinda hot, but no sex scenes (cause sex is evil) and boring tamed down violence.

1760537,1,B00006HMPC,"Just before Buck and Rabbi Ben-Yehuda cross over to the sealed teritory of the Western Wall in Jerusalem, we get a glimpse at a big red warning sign saying in English ""Do not cross. Violators will be shot."" Above the warning in English we get also what seems to be the Hebrew translation to that same warning. However, this is not the case. Someone has decided to either play a prank or just got it all wrong. The letters are in Hebrew but the words mean nothing except for phonetically copy the warning in English backwards. What's wrong? Not enough Jews in NY to translate it correctly? Not funny, just sick.

As to the movie itself, the film suffers from too much missionary mumbo-jumbo and makes very little logic if at all. It also covers all possible racist remarks and inuendos: the Muslims are portrayed as clumsy war-seekers that play into the hands of the Antichrist, whereas the Jews are the genius fools that can be manipulated by both good and evil only to finally witness and confess their historical mistake and sin respectfully.
All other religions are either forgotten or just gathered under the  infamous ""they will perish"" kind of exclamation. Interestingly, The State of Israel is portrayed as a passive, impotent entity for it cannot defend itself in any way. When the Arab joined air forces surprise attack Israel in the first film, the IDF is practically paralysed. In the second film, it is the Antichrist who calls the shots as he orders complete siege of the Western Wall untill his arrival there.

Missionary could have been acceptable and maybe even convincing, in my opinion, if it would have followed some good sense and showed less ignorance. Otherwise, I prefer other positions.",1182988800,,1710,4.809523809523809

In a subtle way it adds some of today's culture and political attitudes to create a story.  It may not be an attempt to guess how all the events will unfold but rather to remind us they will come to pass in some fashion at some point in time.,1154995200,4,358,4.476923076923077
1760544,5,B00006HMPC,"You ask if this (Tribulation) is true, than why bother being a Christian , you can live how you want and then get your 2nd chance in the Tribulation after the Rapture. Well, I assure you, a 'pre-trib' rapture is by FAR the most believed of the three (incl. mid-trib rapture or no rapture...just the Second Coming) The most blatant,obvious proof in scripture of a pre-trib rapture is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves. Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.(NLT)

There is a very good reason to accept Christ NOW before this happens . God promises tomorrow to NO ONE. If anyone that hasn't accepted Christ should die tonight, there IS no second chance, they'll spend eternity in hell and then the lake of fire(unbelievers judged at the Great White Throne Judgement will be cast with Satan into the lake of fire..Revelation 20:11-15) after Christ's 1000 year reign on earth. Even if you choose to deny Christ until after the Rapture and intend on turning to Him during the 7 year Tribulation, it won't be a picnic. Christians will be persecuted and hunted down day and night and be killed, most likely beheaded for their beliefs. The worst of the years will be the final 3 1/2 years which will culminate with Armagedden. As God said in 2 Corinthians 6:2 TODAY is the day of salvation"" I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation.

1760545,1,B00006HMPC,"[...] This movie was simply boring. The content obviously had potential to be exciting but the director, writer and actors felt the need to proselytize instead of telling a good story. Admittedly I haven't read the book version but I did recognize Kirk Cameron doing his Way of the Master evangelical schtick in the middle of the movie trying to convince a ""sinner"" that he was no good.
If one of the goals of this movie is to convince nonChristians of Christ's imminent return than the movie fails because even while I'm up on some of the end time paranoia the movie itself is very confusing and the subplot of ""Buck"" getting involved with a jealous Christian girl is worse than a Growing Pains sitcom scenario.
But the greatest ""sin"" of this movie was that it was boring. And I'm not against Christian movies per se as long as they're entertaining or so bad that they're still entertaining. I mean the original Left Behind dragged in parts but at least it was amusing. This was one was just a snore.
And that's a shame because I don't see how this end time paranoia should be boring. It should be thrilling and enjoyable. I think the problem may be that Christian directors/writers don't know or are afraid to present evil as evil. That may require language, nudity or gory violence. Because evil interests us. The figure who is the anti-christ is about as evil as a corrupt CEO--evil enough, but it's all paperwork and business meetings.

So when I saw Movie #2 I was not expecting much, but it was only a few dollars, so I took a risk.  Turns out, it was actually GOOD this time!

Perhaps they got a different writer, or listened to feedback from the last movie's audience, but there was far less bible-thumping & far more focus on the battle between good and evil.  More akin to what you might find in a Stargate or Buffy/Angel episode.  I enjoyed seeing more of ""the devil"" in this movie, to hear what his motivations were, and why he's seeking to unite the world under one government.  Also, I enjoyed the suspense leading up to the confrontation between the Angels & the devil's UN soldiers.

Although this movie shows its low-budget roots, overall I still enjoyed it, and recommend it for purchase while it's on sale.  (And now I see they have a part 3, which continues the story, so I plan to purchase that next.)",1142208000,4,1157,4.440758293838862

1760558,2,B00006HMPC,"Like the books, Left Behind II is the second in the series, tribulation Force. I hope they do not plan to make twelve of these. They were able to get all the same actors back two years later to film this. And their acting was a bit better then the first movie. The sets were nice, extras did a good job, but the especial effects were not that great. The did the best on the morphing of the Nicolae...which if you think about no one would see him like that until after he was indwelt.

This movie strayed much further from the book then the first movie did. And this time I found it disappointing. I wonder how Buck will continue his work once he is on his own now that he is a TV reporter instead of a writer.

Some of the things that bothered me were: The plane is really small for Global Community One. I guess they could not afford to pay to place that sticker on a 757. Rayford has to almost beg Hattie to become Nicolae's Pilot, the opposite of what happened. Nicolae actually loses his temper and throws a tantrum, very unNicolae like. And though there were many more errors these last two bothered me the most. The two witnesses do not get to actually witness. And they are sealed off from the world. We see them once. And Dr. Ben Judah starts off believing that their is no God, yet Nicolae is the Messiah. The last was most disappointing for me. For he was one character I had a lot of respect for.

Now, though not in the book, the movie is character driven. They are very proactive. Like Rayford going to get his pilot job and Buck getting himself to the Rabbi Tsion Ben Judah speech.  And the angelic character, which does not exist in the book, helps our heroes reach the two witnesses. About half the book was not even referred too in this movie.

- Buck never referred to himself in public as Buck, it was always Cameron.
- Buck was a newspaper writer, not a TV reporter
- The GC didn't forbid people to go near the wailing wall this early in the series.
- Chloe is blonde in the books
- Dr. Benjudah (sp) didn't take the stand he did in the video.  He never said there was no God, and he invited Buck to the wall, not the other way around.
- In the book, Nicolae didn't have outbursts like at the end of the video.
- Rayford didn't have to beg Hattie for the GC1 pilot job, he was practically pushed into it.  Same for Buck.

1760579,5,B00006HMPC,"I may have been a little skeptical about the first Left Behind at first, but then I realized it had a great message to it, and would really mean something in my life. When I saw the sequel, I definetely say this had more meaning to it. It had two characters become christians, which had really been far away from God in the first place, plus this gives people who don't know, more information about him.

It has been exactly one week since people all over the globe have disappeared without a trace. There's confusion everywhere, but not in a few newfound christians, Rayford Steele, Chloe Steele, Bruce Barnes, and Buck Williams. They now know that after what Buck experienced, Nicolae Carpathia, the peace leader of the world, and the secretary general to the UN, isw infact the antichrist. Buck, and Rayford want to help out as much as they can in stopping him, but it may mean giving the devil himself a little help first. They have only one goal, and that's to try and bring more people to God in anyway they can.

It may have been lower budget than the first Left Behind, but this one is definitely better. As a fourteen year old, a lot of people think I'm crazy when I talk about the rapture. When I think about that, I think of Pastor Bruce Barnes in church and how difficult it is to tell these people what they already knew, yet denied it long before.

Thinking about the church scene in the movie, it made me think a lot of 9/11, and how all of the sudden people are going to church, and praising God because of an apocalyptic event. It shouldn't take something like that to get people to go to church, or devote their life to God. It shows you, though, how cowardess people are when something like this happens.

I now own this movie because of these, and glad about it. I still believe the rapture is coming, so I'm careful. As a Christian, I do believe, and hope you believe it too. Just remember, if you are caught in the Tribulation, you can still give your life to God regardless. He stands at the door, and knocks. Just incase, you'd better be prepared BEFORE the rapture. 5 stars instantly.",1079568000,5,2109,4.413881748071979
1760580,1,B00006HMPC,"I felt the first Left Behind film was such a corny lark (if people leave behind dentures and hip replacements, does that mean they also leave behind breast implants when they get Raptured?) that I had to see what Kirk Cameron and crew were up to for their second turn at bat.
I will state this as clearly as possible - nothing happens in this film, absolutely 100% nothing. There's no progression, no forward momentum, nothing. The only thing you could classify as character development is the believers patronizingly preaching to the uninformed. Does anyone want to get their religion from the kid from Growing Pains? The plot consists of our four left behind-ers forming a group (Tribulation force, unite!) that wants to warn the world that the leader of the UN is the, wait for it, Antichrist. This plan goes nowhere. Two of the Tribulation force members contribute nothing to the cause except wistful praying.
The crux of the film is on a learned Rabbi who is to reveal to the whole wide world that Jesus is actually the Messiah. In what universe would a single Rabbi saying something about religion have the world's eyes and ears? And why would everyone systematically accept one man's words as the divine truth? If this was the case couldn't we end this boring movie with Cameron yelling, ""I loves me the Jesus"" and be done with it? I enjoy the Rabbi's slow reveal in his speech. He starts talking about how he's proven who the Messiah is (though we see nothing of his findings) and says it's a man who was born in Bethlehem and betrayed for 30 pieces of silver. Then he says it's Jesus. And the audience literally gasps. This whole plot device couldn't be any more insulting.
Overall Left Behind 2 is far worse than the original film, and that is something of an accomplishment of itself. I challenge you to stay awake and interested into what's going on, because there may be more nothing going on in this film than in the entire history of cinema. Cameron is the best the world of journalism has to offer? And anyone else notice that if you're not Western European in ethnicity you're either evil or dead wrong with your religious beliefs. Take that 4/5 of the world!
There are so many laugh-out-loud moments (like the explanation for millions instantaneously vanishing as ""nuclear radiation,"" are we in 1955 all over again?) but the largest drawback of Left Behind 2 is how horrifically boring it is. The Omega Codes were equally atrocious but campy and slightly entertaining in an I-Can't-Believe-People-Spent-Money-On-This kind of way. Left Behind 2 on the other hand has no sense of humor and no sense of style, let alone competent pacing, directing, and acting. I know sixth graders that could blow the socks off these Left Behind thespians.
I can think of no possible reason anyone should every view this film at any time. I have never been more bored, and I fell asleep during The Thin Red Line three separate times when I saw it in theaters. The only reason you would recommend this film is if you wanted that person to die of boredom.

If you ask me, hats off to Peter and Paul Lalonde for putting out two BETTER quality Christian movies then some of the ones that some of us have seen in our home churches in the past. The poorly made End Time films of the '70s and '80s. Cloud Ten Pictures and Namesake Entertainment did the best with the money they had. It's hard to find funding for Christian Movies-no one's interested and why? Because the message of life through our Lord Jesus Christ will always be attempted to be down-played by those who don't believe.
We need to not be rating this movie like we would secular movies. This movie is trying to get a message of Salvation through Jesus Christ to those who don't believe. It's not about thinking if its' Hollywood quality as far as script and cinematography. And as for the comment about the Angel ""hypnotizing"" the guards, Angels would not use secular means to their advantage. It was the Holy Spirit working through the Angel as she sings it brings forth the mighty power of God to stop those guards. We as Christians need to understand that the Spirit of God is so mighty, mighty enough to stand against any guards and most importantly to stand against Satan.
Who knows, one day when Jesus comes again and the rapture takes place. A person that is left behind may put this video in and realize the reality of what has just happened and commit their life to Jesus Christ.
Bad or good reviews of this movie doesn't matter. Someone's life being touched and changed by the message of Salvation in these movies is ALL that matters!!!!",1062979200,19,1781,4.466257668711656
1760597,2,B00006HMPC,"Having read many of the novels, Left Behind movies turned out to be very poor! The reason I say this is because of the way that the directing of the filming deviated from the orginal story line. Please don't tell me that these things happen all the time because they do not.
What made the the novels incredible reading was the tension and build up. Maybe if I hadn't read the novels I maybe a little more graceful, however, I did and I felt that in most part, the hashed story line had been poorly directed and implemented. I found more tension in watching the grass grow.
There's a scene where buck wanted to get Ben Judah to visit the two witnesses was nothing like the orginal story line, and worst, when then Rayford turned up with an angel singing amazing grace hypnotising the guards made me feel sympathic to guards! Very poor! I'm a christian, but that doesn't mean that I will pay hard earned money to watch utter non-sense.

Second, let me say that I like the actors. I mean, Kirk Cameron's been miscast and his character badly re-written from the books (he's a print journalist, not a tv journalist. Oh: and by the way, live shots take WORK! You don't just turn on a camera and start beaming to the whole world without telling anyone at the office you're about to break into regular programming)! But Kirk is a trooper and does a good job. Clarence Gilyard and Gordon Currie, the best actors of the original movie, are pretty much wasted in this one (although Currie, as Nicolae Carpathia, gets the best special effect). Brad Johnson comes across as the most genuine of the bunch, and Janaya Stephens' character is a vast improvement over the original movie (which was not a bad jumping off point for her).
So the actors did okay given what they had to work with.
My problem with the movie is that they were working with GARBAGE! The writing in the book is bad enough without being given the Cloud Ten treatment. Bleagh.
Let's see, I'm going to take a trip to see a potential girlfriend, but first, I need to take a detour because the anti-Christ is on my roof and wants to talk to me!
I have to show my ID to a security guard, even though he and I are on a first name basis!
I thought the anti-Christ was the Messiah, but a couple of homicidal ""witnesses"" spouting a few verses from the New Testament convinced me to consider Jesus instead.
I just recently became a devout Christian, but I've got no problem inviting a woman AND HER FIANCE to stay in my apartment.
Sigh.
Not to mention that characters are supposed to meet, but don't; characters are supposed to marry, but don't; characters are supposed to die, but don't.
And by the way, this criticism really belongs to the book, but how CHEESY is ""tribulation force"" as a name, anyway? No self-respecting group of Christians would call themselves that. As if four schmoes from Chicago are going to isolate themselves from their church and give themselves such a ""cool"" name based on... based on what, exactly? Cheesy and stupid. They're a circle of friends. Not to be cliche about it, but they are a fellowship. They are not a ""tribulation force."" That's stupid and self-important and detracts so much from what should be the characters' appreciation for God in Christ.
The first movie was campy fun, an evangelical tool that works well as a conversation piece and little else. This movie was just bad. An earlier writer noted that they did a better job of presenting a Christian message, and I'll agree. They did get that right, relatively speaking. But at what cost? Bleagh. That's all I can say.

1760599,3,B00006HMPC,"To begin with, one thing has to be made perfectly clear: a novel and a movie are two completely different forms of artistic expression. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie TRIBULATION FORCE. I really was expecting to totally hate the movie because the book it's based on is nothing more than a glorified romantic novel set against the backdrop of the Tribulation (I think the only reason TRIBULATION FORCE was written was to increase the female readership of the series). However, this movie is better than LEFT BEHIND, correcting mistakes made in that film. Also the filmmakers took enough liberties to make the film much more enjoyable to watch than the book was to read.
The acting in TRIBULATION FORCE is much better than in LEFT BEHIND. Kirk Cameron and Clarence Gilyard were tiers above their fellow performers in the first movie. Their performances still outshine everyone else, but the rest of the cast has developed some acting skills and their characters seem like real people rather than the wooden cut-outs they appeared to be in LEFT BEHIND. The movie's plot is more tight-knitted and not as jumpy as in LEFT BEHIND. The dialogue isn't as cheesy and much of the inexpensive production values are hidden with creative and clever cinematographical tricks.
However, though TRIBULATION FORCE is an improvement upon LEFT BEHIND, the movie makes several mistakes the prevent it from being as good and powerful as it could have been. The mysterious wandering angel was unnecessary and distracting. Her presence isn't justified and there are much better ways that could have explained how Buck visited the Western Wall (a simple scene of praying hands coming together e.g.). The character of Tsion Ben-Judah was highly underdeveloped and the fact that he wasn't a Christian before seeing the two prophets irrated me greatly. Finally, even though the purpose of this film is evangelism, I found that there were too many scenes of witnessing and conversion. The movie would have been more entertaining and therefore reach a wider audience if the only salvation scenes would have been the service at the church and Raymond's talk with his friend.
As a movie, TRIBULATION FORCE is a decent film. It is better than both LEFT BEHIND and the TRIBULATION FORCE novel. The movie is also a better piece of evangelism than the movie LEFT BEHIND. The novice filmmakers are becoming better movie magicians and hopefully if they continue the series, they will again improve in their craft and make a film worthy of showing in movie theatres around the world.",1052006400,37,2571,4.981395348837209

I enjoyed the first ""Left Behind"" movie (albeit not as much as the books) okay. So Of course I wanted the Trib Force DVD. Asked for it for Christmas. Got it. And I must say I am NOT Buying movie 3. They changed the story WAY too much, and in ways that don't make sense. I don't understand why they had to have the characters lying their way into their jobs, and then  snooping around, etc to prove they needed those jobs. OR even leading Rabbi Ben-Judah to Christ. I like the way it was written in the books better. It felt more legitimate. The ONE thing I did like about the films was the conversation with ""Chris"" --> I really get the feeling that was true to life to those who do not want to accept Christ. I see the same attitudes around me, that is. And, as a response to the heavy-handedness, Chris thinking about suicide really felt right as well.

1760604,5,B00006HMPC,"Okay, if you read my review of the first Left Behind movie, than you know I didn't like that one as much because it presented a vague Gospel message...the crucial focal point of the Left Behind series itself.
In Tribulation Force, it's much better. The Savior's name, Jesus, is mentioned a good dozen or two times. There are several touching salvation moments. The characters interact better. The groundwork was laid in the first movie, and now the second movie got better. Granted, it still has a slight air of cheap-ness, but not as bad as the first. (Example, the set for The Wailing Wall just looks like a Wall in a sound stage...I wonder why?)
There are a few changes which kind of throw you off...Tsion Ben-Judah doesn't look very good at all for his character, but he's...at most, acceptable. Besides the actor, the movie guys changed the plot so that Ben-Judah isn't a Christian until halfway through the movie! Big change, and rather unnecessary.
Readers of the book will remember a mix-up between Chloe Steele and Buck Williams. This was portrayed rather differently in the movie. And I was not pleased with the change at all. Chloe actually DID find a woman living in Buck's apartment. For WHATEVER reason, Buck allowed a friend of his, Ivy, to ""crash at his place"" for a few days. There wasn't any sin per se, implied or other, but the implications for public movie-goers could be less than sterling.
The Witnesses - TWO this time - are pretty well-done. The fire-breathing is a little disjointed. First they blow CGI fire, and then some stunt-soldiers have flames on their backs/fronts. To me, if fire were actually BLOWN onto you, you would be engulfed in flames. A little unreal the way they did it.
All-in-all, I give this movie high marks, because they do a better job in comparison to the first movie.",1045180800,,1819,4.723270440251572
1760605,2,B00006HMPC,"Let me start by saying I am a Christian and I am a graduate from the Berklee College of Music. Having worked in musical theatre and worked on movie soundtracks I know a little bit about acting, film making and story writing. I wanted so for this to be a continuation of the original. I wanted this to be taken to the next level because the first one was quite nice. I wanted this to be the sleeper hit of the year.
Sometimes the problem with making a book into the movie is that you don't have the ""film"" time to develop certain characters or plot lines, so they try to re-arrange events to make them ""flow"" better. Unfortunately, this did not work with LBII. If I had not read the book, it would have been more difficult to follow than it was. There were many holes in the movie version. Yes, you can follow what is given, but if the story line had not been as disjointed and some of the crucial parts of the book included; this could have been a very good movie.
Some of the writing could have been better thought out. Unlike the first movie, I felt they tried too hard and thusly wound up creating amateurish scenes instead of great movie meat and potatoes. By trying to compress some of the story lines of the book, you created scenes that were forced, lacking in credibility and sometimes quite difficult to watch.
Now since I'm a music grad, let me tell you the inclusion of sweet strings was over used to try to ""mellow"" or ""pretty-up"" a scene. They would have been better served to just create more ""generic"" classical music. The angel at the Wailing Wall scene was painful to watch. It was confusing; the use of Amazing Grace (musically) did not work and the way the scene played out seemed to need a magician's wand than the grace of God. I know what they were ATTEMPTING to do. That attempt just fell short, in my opinion. I don't know whose idea it was to alter the order of scenes that was so well developed and arranged in the book, but that should have been thought again as well. Don Sebesky (a famous Jazz composer and arranger) once stated, ""There should be a reason for every note"". I didn't get the feeling there was a reason for every bit of dialogue in this movie.
This movie will work if you don't compare it to the first one or definitely not to the books. There is no mandatory sex scene 20-30 minutes into the movie. There is no foul language. Unfortunately when I see a movie, the previously mentioned is not a stellar endorsement for that movie. It's like when asked how the blind date was and the response comes back ""he/she has a nice personality.""
I wanted this to be a really good movie. I wanted this to be something I could recommend. I wanted this movie to work well. God bless all the people involved. Their hearts were in the right place. It's just that their ideas weren't. I do hope they keep trying. I'm sure Oliver Stone's first attempts were not great either.
Do yourself a favor. If you want to be entertained, read the book or get the audio book with Frank Muller narrating. His presentation is ""FABULOUS"" and his Nicolae is both engaging yet evil. Mr. Muller never misses with any of the accents and they all sound different and enjoyable with which to listen.",1044921600,5,3205,4.3882352941176475

Though we do not know precisely how and when it will happen, we know for sure it will come ""like a thief in the night"", without any warnings.  I wish the movies would come out faster.  I can't wait for the next one in the series!!

1760617,1,B00006HMPC,"This movie fails on a number of levels. As it can be viewed on strictly religious terms or as an action thriller, I will address both.
First, let's just talk about it terms of an thriller film. It fails in this regard because it simply makes no sense. People don't act in any sort of real manner. It's simply not how people would act if this were a real situation of millions of people vanishing. You would think the Bible is some book that was only known to the people who vanished and no one else. Everyone else seems to be completely in the dark and don't even make the connection this might be the ""Rapture,"" yet, millions of Christians vanish overnight as Christians have been saying they will. I don't know about you, but if that happens in real life, me and most of the planet would be rushing to Church the next morning. It seems implausible no one would. Everyone goes about their business as if some mugging happened in the neighborhood. The most ridiculous thing is that most people accept the disappearance as some sort of nuclear radiation when that is the most insane excuse that could be even offered. This film is incredibly outdated, a complete fabrication of how and what the U.N. is and how it works. Acting and dialogue are unintentionally hilarious, setting off streams and fits of laughter. In one Church scene, there is a bulletin board and six pictures of people on it with the caption, ""OUR MISSING"" A Church and there is only six missing people? How funny is that? What was it, The Church of Satan? There's no surprises and no tension, especially among the people who are not saved and whom you know will be calling out for Jesus by the end of the picture. There's a lot of talk about the ""Wailing Wall,"" yet what is supposed to be the wailing wall, I guess, looks nothing like the real ""wailing wall,"" as if producers have no clue about the ""wailing wall"" or don't think it's important enough to make a reasonable close simulation of it. The whole movie treats it's audience as simple-minded, uneducated couch potatoes.
Seeing this as a religious film, it is incredibly insulting. This lies the main offense. It's not powerful enough to convert anyone and not realistic enough to make anyone want to know more. It's most heinous crime, though, is how it uses the Jews. If the Jews made a big-budget multi-million dollar film and a huge media campaign about how the Pope came to his senses and announces to the world how he has come to the conclusion that Jesus Christ was not GOD after all and everyone should know that and see the truth, there would be an UPROAR in the Christian community. But they seem to have no problem committing that perfidious insult onto the Jews. Rabbi Ben Judah, the most learned and respected scholar in the world, announces to the planet that Jesus Christ is indeed God and he has been wrong and now knows the truth. This is terrible, terrible injustice to the Jewish faith. Besides the fact that it is simply ludicrous to think that a Rabbi could sit on a podium in Israel and the entire world of different religions is going to sit back and take his word for it just because he thinks so and these other religions be converted (What planet is this film on? Certainly not Earth.), but to put words like that in the mouth of the head of another religion and have them say how wrong they were, well, it's just hateful and disrespectful, that's all. It's also disturbing that the whole conspiracy of trying to take over the world comes from INTERNATIONAL BANKERS, which has always been another word for Jews when it is in this context. It's just another example of the total disregard for the integrity of the Jews. It feigns respect for them while denigrating their beliefs. Coupled with a preposterous plot and representation, this film fails as both an action thriller and as a religious film.",1042070400,9,3851,4.57452966714906
1760618,3,B00006HMPC,"I read the first two novels of the Left Behind series and thouroughly enjoyed them. I waited and waited for the first movie to show up and I thought it was very well done. When I saw the sequel in the video store, I instantly grabbed it to watch. Again, I was not disappointed with the production valuse or acting. I was disappointed that they shaved so much out of the movie. This does not have the epic scale of Left Behind, but it was entertaing - even for a non-Christian.",1040428800,3,476,4.241758241758242
1760619,5,B00006HMPC,"Can it be that the same public that busts this film for having production values that fail to measure up also embraced The Blairwitch Project and turned it into a runaway hit? Face it: A lot of people will eventually settle on criticizing the obvious (the budget and FX) because they know criticizing the faith implicict in the film would be just un-PC enough to make them sound unenlightened or prejudiced. Sure the film preaches largely to the already-converted. But in a climate in which the uncoverted will latch onto any trivial thing to renounce a film, what is a Christian filmmaker to do? The makers have compromised to arrive at a solution which upsets a lot of people here, but so it goes: You have YOUR hits, and we'll have OURS for the present time. Or put another way, we'll give aid and comfort to believers when unbelievers are incontrovertibly hostile and unopen to our message and P.O.V..
This may not be good Christianity, but it makes the kind of business sense that may one day make mounting a Christian Lord of the Rings-caliber SFX extravaganza that also teaches and converts possible. Think about it. Even Christian filmakers live in a business world and pray for a time when something like that won't be only a dream.",1039305600,5,1241,4.697247706422019
1760620,2,B00006HMPC,"This one was definitely better than Left Behind, but it was still VERY substandard and not a movie to be taken seriously by the mainstream public.  Once again, we Christians are accepting a movie that we would NEVER like if we didn't know it was a ""Christian"" film.
If you want to see a movie made by Christians that actually has quality, check out Hometown Legend.  I was skeptical of that movie because it was executive produced by Jerry Jenkins, author of the Left Behind series, but it proved why he did not support the Left Behind movies.  It has fantastic acting, music, cinematography, and has actually been taken seriously by the mainstream and released by Warner Brothers, not just a Christian company.  Hometown Legend was the first film made by Christians that actually excited me.
I really hope that films made by Christians can improve, but as of now, we're still way behind the curve, and we should demand better.",1038873600,,927,4.739130434782608

If you enjoy the books, then you'll enjoy the movies too.  It is a shame that the movie went straight to video bypassing the theaters; it would be great to expose as many people to God as we can and if a medium like the movie theaters can be used, then we should take advantage of it.  The actors did a wonderful job and I commend them all for using their talents to create movies that could change so many lives.  Bravo and Thank You!

If the movie makers were to make a movie word for word to the book, it would be a 4 hour epic, so come on. The movie is a loose interpritation of the book.
I loved the different pacing of this movie from the original, mixing the mild romance between Buck and Chloe and the action that comes climaxing with the events at the wailing wall, and the insuing speech. Okay, so certain characters didn't die at the end.
I am glad that all of the original actors came back to play in thir consecuitive roles, it gives it that extra sense of continuity, and the soundtrack was good, and it added a lot to the feel of the scenes.",1038528000,3,772,4.222972972972973
1760623,1,B00006HMPC,"As a Christian, I think it is great that we are expanding our horizons with the film industry. As a Christian-moviegoer, I find it an embarassment that movies like Left Behind + Omega Code are the best entertainment we have to offer the world.
The Christian film industry, in its' current state, deserves every type of criticism and stereotyping it receives because, let's be honest, it's all true! THESE MOVIES ARE HORRIBLY WRITTEN, ACTED, AND PRODUCED WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE NOT IN THEATRES AND WHY THE VERY SECOND THEY ARE RELEASED THEY HEAD STRAIGHT TO THE BOOKSHELVES!!! Why do we Christians so badly want to get our message out to movie lovers that we'll blindly support and purchase any 2-bit operation that has a Christian moto/message to it? We can do so much better, yet we continue to give our money away to movie houses like Cloud 10 so they can continue to make movies that no non-believer in their right mind would ever want to watch?
Another thing is, why do all major Christian film fall under the category of ""end-times thriller"". I'm sick of hearing movies like Left Behind I+II, Tribulation, Appocalypse, and Omega Code getting so much praise when they are not only horribly made, but are repeating the same messages over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and again! Don't we Christians have anything better to make movies about than an upcoming persecution on believers? I mean, why not make a serious movie with serious characters dealing with serious issues? Why not make a movie about a man torn between God and country? Or a young girl having to decide whether or not to get an abortion? Or about problems inside the church related to new Christians falling unwittingly into a cult? There must be a million other ideas we could use to make good Christian movies! I refuse to believe that we Christians only have the mental capacity to talk about one thing and make bad movies about it that don't serve the topic any justice anyway! The fact is that we can do so much better! And I for one will refuse to support any half-witted film that has no structure or entertainment value whatsoever just because I might hear something positive about Jesus.
Now, after reading my big tirade above, don't think that I haven't fully given up on the Christian film industry. I do firmly believe that there is hope for the future. If you want to support the real filmmakers who can actually keep an audience interested long enough to care about the message of the gospel, I suggest you go out and buy movies like the Veggie Tales. Or better yet, find some ameteur Christian video movie houses online. They're a thousand times better than any major Christian movie house, and they're actually entertaining! Not to mention much, much cheaper than buying a DVD at your local bookstore.",1037664000,9,2825,4.674698795180723

Angels have their own songs to sing praise to God. I would have thought a psalm would have been more appropriate here.
The Two Witnesses costumes are very believeable and sound affects made in their voices sent chills down my spine. The fire breath scene could have been more thought out, though.  You'll have to buy the movie to see what happens here...
I would like to see better directors in sequential productions with more skill.  While this movie will leave you riveted, the level of calibur seen in hollywood productions are still to be attained.",1036368000,,721,4.698412698412699

She just looks SO beautiful and ""alive"" here that she makes this cheesy low-budget film worth watching, and she even makes Chelsea Noble, who I'd usually consider a good-looking woman, look bland and ordinary by comparison! The way Janaya looks in the scene where she is in the purple dress at the Church service...WOW, pure feminine perfection! Her big sweet smile in the photo booth scene with Kirk Cameron would melt any heterosexual man's heart. Her big wide eyes and full-lips, GORGEOUS!!! The Church audience that loves this film might be shocked to know that Janaya is no goody-goody Christian either. In fact, she appeared totally nude during a sex scene in an episode of the Canadian TV show ""Lexx"" (and yes, full nudity is allowed on Canadian TV late at night). Those males who fall in love with her after seeing her here in ""Left Behind 2"" might want to check that episode of ""Lexx"" out too, although I'm sure their pastor won't approve! While I repect this flick's religious message, I may just start my own Church and worship Janaya instead! My Rating: the story and rest of the cast get 3 stars.

1760638,2,B00006HMPC,"People who are born-again Christians will probably appreciate this movie.  I am and I sort of did.  Several of the story-line elements in the movie (I don't think any of the ones I'm thinking of were in the book) are touching and moving.
However, this was the last book in the series that can be portrayed at all on a shoestring budget, bad acting and little or no directing.
Imagine if you will what the spiritual soldiers rampaging through town and killing unbelievers would look like if ILM, or the team that did Lord of the Rings stuff, would look like.  Then think what they'd look like if you did them with your camcorder and a Macintosh in your garage.
If this movie series is going to be a way to reach out to people to share a Christian witness, it has to be done by someone who can spend some money on it.  AND, the way the books have prospered, I think you'd have people beating down the door to do it...I think they could get away with the actors/actresses they have, if there were someone with talent and vision directing them, but I'm guessing they'd toss the cast and start over.  Picture Matt McConaughey as Buck, Joe Mantegna as Ray, Reese Witherspoon as Chloe... I could go on, but no reason.
For all the wonderful things LaHaye and Jenkins have done in the books, character development is not one of their strong suits.  A very talented director and scriptwriter could take these stories, flesh out the characters, and put people on the screen whom you would love, and wait with baited breath for the next episode to see them.
There are many books, so here's hoping that someone else picks up the series and either remakes it altogether or finishes it out from where Cloud 10 left off.  (I'm voting for starting fresh)

I've read each book, strangely attracted to them... now that I have started them I feel compelled to finish, even though they are not very good literature.
I watched Trib Force last night and found myself coming away disappointed, once again.
I'm sure Kirk Cameron is a great guy.  But he just does NOT cut it in this role.  Nicolae is poorly cast.  At the end he came across like a whiny baby.  His accent is pathetic.  (though the special fx where his face morphs is cool!)
There were just a handful of memorable moments in this movie.  But it is definitely a low-budget flick.  I found myself noticing the actors rather than their characters, a very bad sign.  The series needs a complete makeover.  They ought to keep Brad Johnson in his role and scrap the rest of them, recasting for the next movie.

Those of us who have seen books made into films know this is not unusual (for example, see ""The Hunt For Red October"" and then read the book ... you'll be surprised).  But it is a fair adaptation of the material.
In general, the dialogue moves along a little better than the first film.  There are more special effects and they are well done.  For those concerned about Biblical content, especially in relation to the presentation of the Gospel, you need not worry.  Though several verses are combined, the material is presented in proper context throughout the film.
The Two Witnesses of Revelation 11 make their appearance in this film.  Also, Tsion ben Judah delivers his startling announcement regarding Messianic Prophecies from the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.  Virtually all original cast members have reprised their roles and the Gospel is clearly presented, but without ""hitting someone over the head with a Bible"".  Nonetheless, there will still be those who criticize the ""Bible thumping"" aspect of the film.  So be it.

The DVD version of the film includes quite a lot of bonus material, so if possible, make the jump to DVD if you haven't already.  The cinematography is worthy of digital processing.  However I did not see a wide-screen version available at this time.
