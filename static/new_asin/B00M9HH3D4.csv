8670928,2,B00M9HH3D4,"The film was a concept of Daniel Ponickly and was directed by his wife Zoe Quist. They also starred in the film as Adam and Stephanie, an engaged couple who live in Big Sky County. Well actually they live in Wyoming, the other Big Sky Country. Their remote cabin is the site for them to entertain Jack (Christopher Soren Kelly) and Amanda (C. Ashleigh Caldwell) college friends of Adam. Adam and Amanda were once an item for a short time in the freshman year.

Stephanie is an avant-garde student of found footage film making and wants to use the couple in a film project involving Hillbillies attacking the beautiful maidens...a scene that would have been interesting had they actually filmed it. Instead the movie is filled with filler material, of guys and girls talking about their relationship and what marriage should be like...something that might be of interest to newlyweds Ponickly and Quist, but boring for the rest of us.

I warn you. The film has a nice wicked twist which I didn't see coming. The clues were far too sparse and misleading. I did notice that the champagne bottle, the one where Jack pops a cork, had a screw top lid. Bad prop? Or a clue? It could be a clue as we do find out Jack and Amanda are broke and looking for somewhere else to stay, but it wasn't.

8670931,1,B00M9HH3D4,"This was the worst found footage flick i've ever watched,, and i watch a LOT of them because i'm sort of addicted to them. The cover isn't even part of the movie. I'm angry that i even paid for this, the plot was slow and painful; the characters just makes you sick. One female still has me angry, her character makes you want to break your tv, i wished i never watched this crap! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!",1410134400,,402,4.10126582278481
