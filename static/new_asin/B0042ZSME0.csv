8425609,3,B0042ZSME0,i can only give this 3 stars.  not because of the actors.  guess it was the story itself.  just too long and drawn out.  boring in places.  kind of disappointed in the movie.,1525564800,,174,4.151515151515151

8425612,4,B0042ZSME0,"Even though this seemed like a spoof of DDLJ, I still enjoyed the zany antics, the music, and the romantic bits. Ranbir and Deepika were adorable as usual!",1477267200,,155,4.571428571428571
8425613,4,B0042ZSME0,"Started watching on a whim because I really wanted to watch a Bollywood movie and I've enjoyed the performances of Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone in other movies. I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed it ! Ranbir plays Raj, a guy who avoids commitment and acts like quite a jerk to women. The story tells of 3 different relationships he had over the course of maybe 10-15 years, and how he grows during that time and tries to right some wrongs. I have to say, first of all, that I currently live in Switzerland and so when the first of the relationship stories took place in Switzerland (Berner Oberland and Zurich), I was super excited! The references definitely make more sense if you've seen DDLJ already, so I would check that one out first. Someday I'll make it over to Gstaad :)

Anyway, the movie was fun to watch. All the acting was great and the chemistry between Ranbir and each of the leading ladies worked well (plus special appearance by Kunal Kapoor, who plays his part wonderfully). The music fit very nicely with the story. My favorite songs were ""Aahista, Aahista"" and ""Khuda Jaane"", while of course the title song ""Bachna Ae Haseeno"" is super catchy. Overall, it's definitely worth a watch. Enjoy!",1472169600,,1229,4.689814814814815
8425614,4,B0042ZSME0,"The young guy doesn't realize what a jerk he's been to the two women earlier in his life, til he falls in love. Very good movie, there's a music score that goes along with this that's as good as the movie. Ranbir and Deepika both great in this.",1465603200,,244,4.104166666666667
8425615,4,B0042ZSME0,"Ranbir comes from a ""movie"" family that gave him his ""break"" in Bollywood BUT he is a GREAT actor on his own! !  I love the dancing in this film!",1449014400,,145,3.8333333333333335
8425616,4,B0042ZSME0,Quality is good,1431907200,,15,4.333333333333333
8425617,5,B0042ZSME0,"The movie plot is fabulous. The dancing and songs are incredible. Above all, Ranbir and the actresses, especially Deepika, compliment one another perfectly. I see why Ranbir easily became a Bollywood superstar and Deepika to the top with this film.",1412985600,,248,5.225
8425618,5,B0042ZSME0,Watch DDLJ first. Then Bachna Ae Haseeno. Both are entertaining. The younger Indian culture is interesting to see. Maybe more films about the younger generations in other cultures would help us see their hopes and dreams.,1402358400,,221,5.166666666666667
