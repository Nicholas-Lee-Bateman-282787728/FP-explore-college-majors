8624445,1,B00GM45VIY,"AJR Discos who is selling this DVD never reviewed it for quality control. The audio and video is very poor. The video is not narrated by the person stated on the cover as we expected and my wife used to have this DVD and says that the actor does not even represent the video well. There was no description on this DVD. We would like to return it for a refund. If the company wants it back, fine. We are willing to discard the DVD as it is of no use to us at all. We will ship it to you if you would like to see what we are telling you about the the quality. Thank you, Ron",1398124800,,572,3.8151260504201683
