When the popular revolt in Nicaragua against Somoza attracted world attention in the late 1970s, many journalists went there to report the news. One journalist made world news when he was murdered by government forces, and another reporter filmed this event. This 1983 movie weaves this incident into a story about those days.

The scene in Nicaragua starts with a parade. Rebels infiltrate and hoist a banner; the military chase them. This is photographed by a journalist who climbs on top of a parked car. (NEVER park your car by a parade route!) The rebels invade a night club, a grenade goes off, and then Russell ""visits"" the police station. A ""businessman"" gets him released, and then suggests that Russell visit the provincial capital where the Sandinistas are active. Russell photographs the action, and gets involved. The pitching skills of a Nicaraguan are used, but he is soon retired from this game.

Back in the capital Somoza announces the death of the rebel Commander, Rafael. Russell visits this province to photograph the news. He meets the rebel leaders, and agrees to photograph Rafael in a live setting; others in the rebel camp are photographed. The movie shows how ancient DC-3s are used as military weapons. Alex returns and asks to visit Rafael. Russell discovers that his photos are being used to identify and eliminate the rebels! When Alex can't find Rafael, he wants to do a story on the ""businessman"". But Alex is prevented from doing this by unidentified soldiers. Russell photographs this, but escapes with his life. The film gets back to the hotel, and is published. Somoza flees the country, and lands in Miami. And so it finally ends happily? Or does it? Could such a movie be made today?

The romantic triangle (older man, younger woman, younger man) reminds me of ""The Quiet American"".",1437609600,,1860,4.895238095238096
