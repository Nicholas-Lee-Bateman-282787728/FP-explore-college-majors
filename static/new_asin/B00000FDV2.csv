7908272,5,B00000FDV2,"When I was in grade school, one of the local stations had a weekday morning cartoon show that ended at 8:30 a.m. After watching it, if I ran all the way, I could just make it to school on time. The show was a hodgepodge of Famous Studios cartoons (mainly I remember Casper the Friendly Ghost and Herman & Catnip, as well as the 'bouncing ball' sing-alongs) and 'Little Rascals' two-reelers. This tape really took me back to those bygone, halcyon days of cold cereal in front of the TV (ours was black-&-white), watching cartoons that, even when I was a kid, were antiques. They seemed to put me in touch with an older, vanished, more perfect world...

This tape includes 'There's Good Boos Tonight' (one of Casper's earliest), 'Lone Star State' (you can sing along with the 'bouncing ball' to the tune of ""Deep in the Heart of Texas""), 'Friendly Ghost' (more Casper, this time with a little girl named Bonnie), 'Ants in the Plants' (directed by animation legend Dave Fleischer), 'A Haunting We Will Go' (more Casper, what else?), 'Mutt in a Rut' (cats & dogs), 'Base Brawl' (baseball sing-along), 'Sudden Fried Chicken' (Herman but no Catnip, instead a rooster named Henry), 'It's a Hap Hap Happy Day' (with Gabby, the Lilliputian know-it-all from Fleischer's ""Gulliver's Travels"") and 'The Golden State' (another 'bouncing ball' sing-along, this time to the tune of ""California, Here I Come"").

Fun for the whole family, or for you Gen X-ers (like me) in need of an early childhood nostalgia-fix.",1209340800,,1497,4.84375
