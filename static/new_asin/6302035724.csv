416436,4,6302035724,"if you don't mind a little fluff and not much of a story, this is a GREAT little easy to watch, fun movie with decent story line, good actors and lots of laughs. it really reflects good old surfing heydays and beach trivia.

FUN FUN FUN ... wish it were on DVD but probably never will be unless it is no longer copyrighted.  then hopefully some independent will get a good print and publish it. it really deserves to be seen.",1300233600,8,425,4.234567901234568
416437,2,6302035724,"Good movie about some kid who arrives from Chicago,trying to fit into one California Beach town,who tries to learn how to surf and get girls. a good coming of age movie, but not one of the best, really cool beat up pontiac in the movie, and a Custom Corvette Solid Axle.",1263772800,2,270,4.313725490196078

416556,5,6302035724,"Movie is one of my old favorites. Filmed in Avila Beach at my Dads Restaurant, the original Custom House.
Enjoy it!",1447804800,,115,4.523809523809524
416557,4,6302035724,"This is a fun old movie that can be a bit clunky with the story line but it's nowhere near as bad as it has been portrayed by ""professional"" critics.
Depending on your age, it may draw you in with the music and characters that will fondly remind you or your life when you were younger.
And it's better than a lot of the cookie-cutter c-r-a-p-o-l-a that Hollywood vomits forth today.
Pay attention to the facial expressions.
Enjoy!",1447632000,3,430,4.5256410256410255

Amazon was the only place I could find her movies that'. Looking for old movies is how I found this and many others of  her movies. Amazon has tons of movies any year .",1389139200,,257,4.03921568627451
416682,5,6302035724,"I've been waiting for this to be released again for quite awhile now. I enjoyed it just as much as the first time I saw it. Cheesy surfer back story, but the overall theme is pretty good. Humorous side story about a grease monkey lusting after a Corvette is a bonus.",1387497600,,266,4.235294117647059
416683,5,6302035724,"This movie starts a little slow but then heat up as the story unfolds. It's about a young boy from Chicago, coming of age on the beaches of California.

416684,5,6302035724,Wish it would come on DVD. But VHS tape quality is what expected. Very good copy for price.  Was a movie I saw as a youth. Being from the west coast it always reminds me of my beach days as a kid of 10 - 14.,1328227200,5,207,3.5

I was a bit hesitant to watch it, as some movies from eighties just don't seem as good when I watch them now. That wasn't the case here. I really enjoyed seeing it again. If you grew up in the 70's and 80's and love California and the beach, this movie is worth a look.",1506902400,,389,3.7439024390243905
7819949,4,6302035724,I saw this movie back in the day and was glad to stumble on to again. It's a quirky nostalgic and occasionally cliche story of a long lost California beach that manages to draw you in. Tanya Roberts was indeed as drop dead gorgeous as I had remembered!,1494979200,,252,4.270833333333333

7819951,4,6302035724,"Is this a four star movie?  Well, of course not.  But the experience is to some people, including me. That being said, it actually has kind of a sweet tone and message to it, it's very 60's 70's and the real reason I like it is shot in Avila Beach, CA (and Pismo Beach), back before the town was torn down and rebuilt by Union Oil.  It's probably the only way you'll see what a cool, funky town Avila was 'back in the day'.
It's still beautiful (picture attached!!), but it's all upscale now.  This is a real slice of California in the 60's.",1477526400,2,541,4.173076923076923
