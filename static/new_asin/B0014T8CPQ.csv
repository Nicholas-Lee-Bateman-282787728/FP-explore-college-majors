8256240,3,B0014T8CPQ,"I was looking forward to this workout. The idea to have low weigths-high reps and heavy weights-low reps on the same DVD is great, but the reality is that I didn't feel worked out afterwards. Some body parts are somewhat neglected. For example, I like to work my chest intensly, not just a few pushups. Triceps is not done enough. I also found it boring overall and Trish says ""y'all"" way too many times. I have so many first-class advanced exercise DVDs that I just don't want to waste my time with this one. Too easy, boring and not enjoyable for me, however, for the beginner/intermediate exerciser this is probably a great place to start.",1247788800,,642,4.591304347826087
8256241,4,B0014T8CPQ,"Brief Synopsis: Strength Attack includes 2 ways of working out:Low Resistance with Hi Repetitions or Hi Resistance with Low Repetitions (resistance refers to the amount of weight you use). Trish focuses on functional exercises which improve your ability to do everyday activities such as carrying your kids or shoveling snow. This means a lot of compound moves (where you work your upper and lower body simultaneously) and focus on balance.
  You start off this intense strength workout with a quick warm-up and then proceed into moves using light weights (Trish uses 5-lbs) and doing many repetitions of the exercise. Afterwards, you move into the high resistance portion (she uses 8-10 lbs).  No muscle is left untouched, but I find the lower body make be worked a bit more.  This workout is really effective for developing strength and balance. She finishes off with a very thorough 19 minute stretch, which could be a workout by itself.

Equipment Needed: Requires light and heavy dumbbells. A medicine ball is used but you can substitute with dumbbells.

Level: Advanced/Intermediate (This is a lot of work but you can choose to do either just the low or high resistance, and this would make it more do-able and cut your workout time in half).

Instructor: Trish Muse is very personable and encouraging without being annoying. She does not count out each move, which works for me but some people might find disconcerting. She is a physical therapist so she focuses on proper form and includes a lot of unique moves.

Special Features: If you don't want to do the entire workout you can choose a Strength Attach Mix, which has 8 different ways to combine the various sections. You can choose to do just low or high resistance.

Overall: I really like Strength Attack and felt it was really effective at improving my overall fitness level (strength, flexibility and balance). My core got a great workout, and she really worked the calves and rotator cuff which a lot of instructors ignore. She includes some new moves and works every muscle group, so I would definitely recommend this workout.",1231372800,5,2096,4.931818181818182
8256242,5,B0014T8CPQ,"I never had a Trish Muse workout before, but I've seen her dvds around and finally decided to try one.  This is the one I picked and it's great.  Based on this I would definately look at buying more of hers.  I think she's terrific and outgoing and encouraging.
Here, there is a bit of everything.  You do light weights with lots of reps and then heavier weights with fewer reps and there is core work that's done on the floor.  It's almost non-stop from start to end and I actually find that my heart rate is elevated throughout.  My favourite segment though, is the stretches and flexibility work.  It's top notch and you can do that as it's own workout if you want.  All you really need are two sets of weights and a medicine ball and you're good to go.  I have a lot of strength dvds but this is one of the best ones.  I love it and have done it many times.  You will feel the burn for sure because the entire program is about 1 hour.  It's fun and effective and I hope you all love it too.",1217116800,10,994,4.0932642487046635
