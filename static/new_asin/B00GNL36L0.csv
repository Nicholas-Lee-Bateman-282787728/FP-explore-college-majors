I actually just checked to see if they had made a second Solibeat  but unfortunately they haven't.",1440201600,,255,4.543478260869565

8625116,4,B00GNL36L0,"Very good workout for people who like to dance and appreciate music from other cultures, so the movements might be a little different.  It's all done barefoot with music accompanied by drum music.  The dances are definitely high energy, and you need to do them more than once to follow the steps.",1419292800,3,296,4.673076923076923
8625117,1,B00GNL36L0,"I was really excited to try this because it sounded fun and different and the girls on the front cover are pretty. But the workouts are hard to follow, don't flow well, and don't feel like workouts. They're all over the place, and it just seems like these girls were hanging out at home and decided to dance around and make a workout video of it. I'm glad I only spent 5 bucks on it.",1419292800,9,383,4.12
