4308942,5,B004AGDJIA,"My husband and I were unable to attend the latest Kenny Chesney concert series, and I was doubtful that a DVD could do justice to the real thing. (We had seen him live in 2007 so I knew what a great live performer he was).
It was a WONDERFUL experience even though I was only in front of my own TV set!! The DVD quality is great, the song selection is excellent and it truly felt like I was at a concert. I would highly recommend this DVD!!",1281398400,20,440,4.011363636363637
4308943,4,B004AGDJIA,"I can well-imagine why Kenny Chesney was voted entertainer of the year four years running. His songs define what makes modern country music so much fun: fast, funny, insightful, introspective, sensitive, and all with great voice. To be honest, this is what I think Chesney should pay homage to...his voice. Superb!

All that said, this man could not dance to save his life! I can only give this DVD four stars, as I could just as well listen to the radio or to my iTunes collection, gaining just as much satisfaction. His performance in this DVD provides nothing more than a repeat of his studio recordings: nothing new or envelope-pushing beyond the same tunes we know and love to listen to. He does nothing to spice up his songs in the live performance, nor does he give us something different in the material itself - no covers of other popular artists, nothing outside the normal album Chesney repertoire. [For example, only in a live performance will you see Sting doing his fantastic reworking of Jimmy Hendrix's ""Purple Haze.""] Yes, there is a lot of running around on stage on this DVD, high-fiving the audience members, and having fun with this band musicians. But to be completely honest, this DVD is nothing more than a group of guys pretending what they are doing is out of the ordinary.

Don't misunderstand, I purchased this DVD because Chesney is one of my favorite artists. However, I am very glad I watched the DVD for a fraction of the cost of a live performance ticket. I did not miss a thing in a live concert. Buy his music, listen to the radio, visit his website, join his fanclub...but save your money on this DVD.",1280707200,2,1637,4.641379310344828
4308944,5,B004AGDJIA,"I saw this at the theatre and it was like a mini concert with beach balls and all!

I have been to see him at Gillette Stadium 4 times and it was neat to see parts of it in this movie.

If your a Kenny Chesney fan, you will love this. He does some commentary between songs and it gives you a great insight into who he is and where his music comes from.

I'll be buying the DVD....",1273795200,4,380,3.7848101265822787

4308958,3,B004AGDJIA,"Last year, while attending Cedia 2011, I had the pleasure of
watching a fantastic live concert demo courtesy of SIM 2.  With
a dual projection system in the room, I donned a pair of passive
eyewear and watched an amazing clip of The Black Eye Peas
taking center stage at a concert performance.  It was probably one
of the best 3D experiences I have ever had.  Fergie seemed
more alive and beautiful than I ever imagined.

From that experience alone I knew that concert videos would
be the most attractive seller for 3D.  What a better way to come
face-to-face with your favorite musical performer or group than
in a 3D audio and video environment that goes beyond just putting
you in the front row, but rather places you squarely in the middle of
an event.

It's very unfortunate that studios haven't been rolling out a lot
of 3D concerts on Blu-ray.  The problem is either the lack of
interest, or perhaps there just hasn't been enough concerts
taped in the newest home format.  I am hoping the problem
is the latter.

So, as of the date of this review, when one is considering
purchasing a 3D concert on Blu-ray, you have less than 5
choices to pick from.  These include Hannah Montana,
Jonas Brothers and Kenny Chesney.

Sigh!

When Image sent me Kenny Chesney Summer in 3D
to review I wasn't necessarily thrilled.  This northern boy
has never heard of Mr. Chesney -- most likely due to the
fact that I really have no interest nor appreciation of
country music.  Most of the radio stations up here are
mostly filled with pop, rap rock and roll (though a few country
stations do exist).

So, upon doing some initial research I came to discover
that Chesney was originally born in Knoxville Tennessee,
has recorded 15 albums and produced over 30 singles that
have ended up as Top Ten songs in the Billboard Country
charts.  He has been awarded Entertainer of the Year by
the Country Music Association for 4 consecutive years in
a row.  He has a huge fanbase which is very loyal to his
music and has helped him become one of the most popular
touring acts in the country.

All of this becomes plainly evident while watching this
concert video directed by Joe Thomas and filmed in 2009
over the course of 6 nights across several cities that include
Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Indianapolis, Boston, Philadelphia
and Seattle.  These concerts comprised the last leg of Kenny's
tour prior to him taking some much needed time off.  He is
returning to the stage this year.

Within its running length of 99 minutes, this concert
video manages to feature 23 songs which include Old Blue
Chair, No Shirt, No Problems and Back Where I Come From.
Of course, not being a fan, I'm not certain these are his
best works, but gauging from the crowd that knew the words
to every song Chesney sang, I doubt that there isn't anything
included here that fans won't be appreciative of.

The then 41-year-old singer shows a great deal of energy,
building sweat as he runs from one end of the stage to another,
across multiple runways that extend into the audience -- often
connecting personally with his fans.  Between many of the songs,
we are treated to a scrapbook of home movies and stills as
Chesney reflects on growing up in east Tennessee, falling in
love with music and playing everything from college bar rooms
to coliseums, arenas and stadiums.  I must say, I was rather
touched by Mr. Chesney's devotion to his friends and fans.
He seems quite appreciative of the things that life has given
him, never forgetting where he came from.

I have to admit, I found this concert to be far more entertaining
than I had thought.  It's a lot less country and more rock and
roll with the infusion of Jimmy Buffet.  Chesney's voice seems
to be in great shape here and he's backed onstage by a dozen
musicians, electric guitars and a full horn section. At times, the
venue comes alive with nice foot-stomping rock.

Multiple cameras provide stunning shots of the concert from
every angle possible.  The high definition image is crisp and
provides a full array of colors from the spotlights and rear
screen projection.  This intensely lit show comes off brilliantly
on Blu-ray.

Much planning was put into making this 3D experience as
effective as possible.  The film opens with Chesney arriving on
stage above the audience, sitting on a chair secured by wire.
This remarkable entrance gives us just a hint of the great 3D
that is to follow.  While there is not a hint of ""In Yo' Face""
objects being thrown towards the screen, the real magic comes
from cameras cleverly placed behind drum kits and microphones
where viewers get a real sense of of defined depth. This is another
one of those picture window experiences where you feel as if you
can reach out and touch the objects from within your screen.
Your eyes can be firmly focused on Chesney, only to be
pleasantly distracted by hands reaching up from the audience
that stand before him.  I was very surprised that with all the
quick cuts in the concert action there were no blurring problems.
Since the concert footage was shot at night, there is a few
noticeable instances of ghosting whereas you have double
images around the musicians and even the microphones.
This doesn't appear to be a major problem or diversion.

The film's 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack completes the experience
of placing you squarely in the middle of the stadium.  The
audio is immensely dynamic with the center channel clearly
reproducing Chesney's vocals.  The left and right channels
provide an amazing amount of fidelity with the rears surrounding
you with the roars of the audience.  The only thing that I found
lacking here was a substantial amount of bass, which I would
have personally preferred.

The Blu-ray contains both 3D and 2D versions of the film.
There are 4 bonus songs featured separately on this release,
not seen in the theatrical version. Those sequences are in 2D.

Not being a fan of Kenny Chesney and listening to his
music for the first time, I must say that I liked what I
heard.  I can just imagine what a satisfying experience
this film will be for his fans.

Fan or not, Kenny Chesney Summer in 3D effectively
shows how great concert footage can look when filmed
in this new format.  One can only hope that we see more
releases such as this in the very near future.",1453075200,,6293,4.651898734177215

4308962,5,B004AGDJIA,"What could be better than Kenny Chesney, In the Summertime, in 3D??? Not much. This is one of the first 3D movies we bought when we got our Samsung 3D television.  I could watch this over and over. The production of this is outstanding. You can tell they put a lot of thought and planning into this, as they do all of his concerts. I have only been to one of his concerts in real life and this 3D experience is almost as memorable. You can feel the energy of him, his band and the crowd. This is as close to a real concert you can get.

The sound quality is really amazing. Getting up close and personal with Kenny is more than amazing. He is one of my all time favorite artists so I am glad that we purchased this. A Blue-ray disc can be played endless times. For less than the cost of a concert ticket, you can enjoy the experience in your own home. You could just also play this and listen to the music as you do other things if you don't have time to sit down and watch the movie.

This is a must buy item if you are a Kenny Chesney fan. If you are interested in music or concerts in general, I am sure you would enjoy this too.  I purchased this on Amazon, paying full price for it.",1446508800,,1187,4.016949152542373

4309012,5,B004AGDJIA,"This is a terrific DVD featuring a wide array of Kenny Chesney songs that were performed in concert. The DVD showcases concerts from a half-dozen different cities and runs 99 minutes.  There is some brief commentary mixed in, and still photo shots from time to time too.

The first few songs are very upbeat and rousing, such as Live These Songs, Summertime, and Beer in Mexico. There's more than a couple `beer drinking' songs featured too.  The middle of the presentation has some more serious songs such as There Goes My Life and Old Blue Chair. But the `fun/party' theme soon returns with Living In Fast Forward and later She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy.  The DVD wraps up with a tearful performance of Better As A Memory.

The DVD showcases Chesney's Country/Rock spectacle with many great shots of the crowds, his band, and of course Chesney himself.  As usual he's dressed pretty casual in well-worn jeans, a sleeveless shirt, cowboy hat, and boots.  His band gets some well-deserved attention in some numbers too.  While I like some songs a lot more than others I felt like I was part of the crowd having a great time. The presentation as a whole is awesome.",1371859200,,1163,4.694581280788177

What was also great about this DVD was getting to see his sexy body while he sang! LOL Again it was EXCITING & FAB to watch!! The one song that Kenny sang & I could tell that it got to him a little @ the end was There Goes My Life. When I hear this song it brings tears to my eyes everytime.

4309031,4,B004AGDJIA,"Let me start off by saying ,I have only seen Kenny Chesney a couple of times on the CMA awards and he was very good. Did you ever just know when you see something come out it's going to be good? Well, I took a chance and ordered the movie in 3D-and I must say it is just wonderful. The selection of songs were great and he sure knows ow to work a crowd, his energy is something to see and it gets emotional towards the end.  As for the 3-D, I feel it really added to the experience and made me feel I was there. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the confusion that is out there that you have to be very careful when ordering and that you read the description carefully to make sure you get the 3-D verson if that is what you want. Just buy it ,sit back and enjoy.",1344470400,,777,3.85625

4309075,4,B004AGDJIA,"Ok, so well it is Kenny Chesney, and if you are a Kenny Chesney fan you'll enjoy seeing him run around the stage looking all sexy!  However, the issue I have with this is that since it was made for the Big Screen, they edited it to where he is voiced over.  They added perfect singing over top of his concert singing.  The problem is that it's not always perfectly matched, so it appears as though he is lip singing the concert.  Now, as a Kenny fan I do not believe he would ever do that - so I have summed it up to the production team that put this together for the big screen.
It does bother me to see it though, and I honestly prefer a real Kenny Chesney concert to this voiced over version.
Now, saying that - I KNEW this BEFORE I bought the DVD, so obviously it did not stop me from purchasing it!
Like I said, it IS still Kenny - and it is still his music!  So I think Kenny fans will enjoy it regardless, but might be a little embarrassing to show to others that aren't such big Kenny fans!  They will assume he doesn't really sing at his concerts.",1325203200,3,1056,4.052884615384615

If you have never experienced 3D television please try it. I know 3D isn't for everyone but I really do enjoy 3D TV and own over 2 dozen 3D Bluray DVDs.

4309094,4,B004AGDJIA,"Not the biggest Kenny Chesney fan, but he does have a number of catchy tunes.

But they did pretty good with the camera angles to show off some 3D goodness. The cameras are on suspended wires that float above the crowd - showing some cool vantage points.

The band itself isn't super active (this aint a Brittany Spears concert) but Kenny himself is all over the place. Lots of fun (especially the opening scene).

We look forward to more concerts in this format. Maybe bring the price down to about twenty bux?",1303776000,,511,4.532608695652174
4309095,1,B004AGDJIA,"The concert takes were great. However, this Blu-ray 3D is one of the worst Blu-ray 3D's that I have viewed. Even worse than the new Blu-ray 3D release of Tron.

The 2D viewing of this disk was great and the sound was fantastic. However, I didn't purchase the Blu-ray 3D version to watch a regular DVD version.

At first I thought the problem could be with my main Blu-ray 3D player and 3D HDTV. So I played it in 3D mode on my other 3D set-up, same problem. Went to my neighbor who just bought a new high-end Panasonic set-up and was welcomed with the same unwatchable 3D effect.

I have contacted IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT BUT HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THEM.

I pre-ordered this a very long time ago when it was first listed on Amazon for pre-order. Was then notified late last year that the release of the Blu-ray 3D was being pushed out with no new release date. Finally made available this past March.

There has been a lot of confusion regarding this Kenny Chesney 2D DVD and Blu-ray 3D release. I don't fault Amazon for this confusion because the supplier of the product, in this case IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT, supplies the script and marketing data to the sales outlets. Usually the sales outlet, in this case Amazon, prints and displays whatever the supplier of the product gives them to market the product.

For some reason IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT hid the Blu-ray 3D logo on the bottom back of the case. When viewing the front of the case it only had printed, 3D & 2D ON ONE DISK, NO Blu-ray 3D logo. This led to the question. ""what 3D format is this Blu-ray disk""? Is it only to be viewed with the old red and blue cardboard glasses?",1303689600,4,1627,4.442953020134228
4309096,5,B004AGDJIA,"OK-first of all; this is in 2D-not 3D. With that said, it's a great concert of Kenny Chesney. I've listened to his music since he first started out years ago. This DVD has a wide variety of songs-mostly hits. There's a little interview footage interspersed throughout. All in all-I think it's a great value-there's somewhere around 20 songs on here.",1303689600,,349,4.833333333333333
4309097,1,B004AGDJIA,"This was supposed to be the 3D version, but came as the 2D version. who would want a 3D DVD in 2D???",1303344000,4,100,3.590909090909091
4309098,4,B004AGDJIA,"Unlike the bulk of the reviews on here, I actually purchased this blu-ray disc and watched it in 3d mode on my Mitsubishi WD-73838 TV using 3d glasses.  The 3d effects are not as cool or as astonishing as some other 3d films.  Nothing pops out to the extent you'd be surprised.  That said, you can definitely see the effect at different times.  For instance, you can see him walking near the crowd and the hands of people in the audience appear 3d.  Also, you can see depth in Kenny being at one part of the stage and other musicians being behind him.  So, the effects are small things.

More than anything, the 3d effect just makes the picture a bit sharper and more enjoyable to watch.  It's almost like being at the concert if you are listening to this on a nice sound system.

Overall, I would recommend this blu-ray.  But, if you're looking to dazzle people with the 3d effects, this is probably not the one to buy.",1301529600,8,920,4.358823529411764
4309099,1,B004AGDJIA,How cheap can one get? This title was released on DVD last summer with 3D blasted all over the cover. Then in tiny lettering as listed as not in 3D. If the artist is that desperate as to lie about video releases then I am not interested. If you are going to release a DVD as 3D then subltly explain that it isn't in 3D at all then at least be honest. Don't buy since it is a final insult to former fans.,1300492800,7,403,3.8674698795180724
4309100,1,B004AGDJIA,"I guess this re-release is for super fans only or people who didn't live near a location of the department store that had the exclusive right to sell the original release last year. According to Image Entertainment's website, the company releasing the new director's cut dvd, this dvd has 4 songs not included on the original dvd release, not the 7 that Amazon's listing description here claims. The songs are You & Me, Guitars and Tiki Bars, Don't Blink and Never Wanted Nothing More.

The concert in this dvd is very good with Kenny giving energetic performances. If you already own the original release, it's your call whether you want to re-buy it for 4 extra songs. The concert gets 5 stars from me, but this dvd gets 1 star for the cash grab by the dvd company. Trying to double your sales by temping big Chesney fans to re-buy something they already own is a cheap way to make money.",1296259200,12,890,4.527950310559007
