The Flesh and the Fiends (1960) stars Peter Cushing in one of his more sympathetic roles as Dr. Knox, who wasn't too particular where he got his stiffs for surgery class. This is based on the actual murder scandal of the early 19th Century and is very atmospheric and Jack the Ripper-gothic. Donald (I shot him six times!) Pleasance displays a playful Mr. Hare (of Burks and Hare, that is) as he and his dimwitted partner, Mr. Burke (of Burke and Hare, that is) murder poor slobs for Dr. Knox's coin. Pleasance's character is obvious inspiration to Malcolm McDowell's socialpatic anarchist from A Clockwork Orange (1971). Yes, the Continental Version with the nudity is on this DVD.

Graveyard of Horror (1971) is an Eurpopean (Italian, I believe) horror movie that looks as if it were shot on-location at the same monastery as the first two Tombs of the Blind Dead films; the movie is slow, slow, slow and slow; all the women are haters (a/k/a harpies), except for the young hot one, who seems to be in love with her uncle (?); we have another goober stealing corpses for profit in here, too, but this time the corpses are being eaten by a nutty doctor that obviously took a stupid pill before he turned himself into a cannibalistic lizardman that we don't see until the last ten minutes or so. Most of this film is bickering women and men being cruel to bickering women who all in love with this girl's self-centered uncle. It's an european thing, I guess. The goober stealing bodies looks like a shorter version of Reggie Bannister from Phantasm (1979). Strange, dull movie but excellent locales and creepy camerawork...oh, the harmonica, whistling and twanging soundtrack sucks artichokes.

Raiders of the Living Dead (1986) is an awesome title. I'm thinking of Indiana Jones battling zombies for a fabled Ruby of Necropolis or some such thingie, but, alas, no, nothing quite so ostentatious. What we have is a collaboration of three movies (the previous two attempts at failed cinema are also included on the 2-DVD set) that somehow make an entertaining film, not great, not art and not intelligent, but stupid fun. Throw in Laserblast, Night of the Living Dead and Indiana Jones by way of a meth lab and you get this bizarre, low-budget movie. Dreck to some but popcorn silliness to me.

I bought this set for a fiscal reason. I could have purchased just Flesh and the Fiends for the same price that I paid for this collection, instead I got five movies for the price of one great movie. Can't go wrong there.",1352419200,,2633,4.729847494553377
