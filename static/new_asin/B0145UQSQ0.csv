8729795,4,B0145UQSQ0,"As good as remembered, acting and writing wise, but the  audio and visual quality lacked rating as a five star. Copied from 16 mm for the DVDs. Don't know why season 2 had 40 shows but enjoyed each of them. Season 1 has more that the normal number of shows. Great TV from the past;.",1466294400,3,282,4.127272727272727
