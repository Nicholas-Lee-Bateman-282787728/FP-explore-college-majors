8516776,3,B007HOND0G,"The Tag Team Match between Los Maximos(Jose & Joel) against the team of Jimmy Yang & Tony Mamaluke was decent but nothing special. The Rich Criado-Josh Daniels match was pretty good. The Da Hit Squad(Monsta Mack & Mafia)-Samoan Island Tribe(Samu & Ekmo) was average with a poor finish to ruin it. The CW Anderson-Steve ""Dr. Death"" Williams match was average yet overbooked. The Jerry Lynn-Homicide match was strange with lots of flashes(good & bad) to boot. The Simon Diamond-Sandman match was awful this side of WCW. The Mikey Whipwreck-Sabu match was decent and a good reminder of the 1990's ECW. The Rich Criado-NOSAWA match was short and pointless. The CM Punk/Michael Shane-Raven/Norman Smiley tag team match was decent even with the booking. The Terry Funk-Abdullah The Butcher match was a good old school blood bath to say the least. The World title match between Mike Awesome & Steve Corino was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl even with the dusty finish. The Impromptu handicap match between the team of The Sandman & Steve ""Dr. Death"" Willaims against the team of Steve Corino,CW Anderson & Simon Diamond was average but maybe the best bout on the card due to it's length. I give this dvd a 5 out of 10.",1445817600,,1209,4.87378640776699
8516777,2,B007HOND0G,"First off I love HighSpots Videos. They're really insightful and cool to watch. Especially the documentaries. (HighSpots is great at having wrestlers shoot on certain topics) This video was just bad. Nothing really worth watching on here as the matches weren't that great and there wasn't a lot of really good known indy or other pro wrestlers on this set for how long it is. Run time is 2hrs 50min. The matches I'm listing happen later in the DVD. There's a bunch of other matches on here first that aren't promoted on the case.

Impromptu Match
Steve Williams & The Sandman vs. Extreme Horseman

World Heavyweight Title Match

Los Maximos vs. Jimmy Yang & Tony Mamaluke

Even with some of the great names on here, this is low budget, and the wrestling is poor. Even the CM Punk match is slow and boring. WWE Developmental NXT on the WWE Network even makes this DVD look awful. I'm a huge wrestling fan and hate rating these indy promotions low but I'm being honest and expected way more, especially for the price.",1415577600,,1434,4.706827309236948
