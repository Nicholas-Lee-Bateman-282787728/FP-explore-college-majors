Movies like this one were produced for pure clean entertainment. Really basic story of 2 newlyweds played by the then box office stars young JULISSA (she also was a singer) & Mr. RODOLFO DE ANDA (R.I.P. 2010)AND THE EQUALLY FAMOUS & VERY SEXY MS. FANNY CANO (R.I.P. 1983)
Ms. Cano enters the picture as the other woman, the temptress trying to steal JULISSA's husband by trying every imaginable trick. Not a dramatic picture in the sense of a spanish soap opera (telenovela) but enough serious touches here and there to add to what really is a light comedy. WHO WILL KEEP THE MAN IN THE END? FIND OUT BY WATCHING. MY ONLY COMPLAINT HERE, AT NO FAULT OF THE SELLER, IS THAT THIS MOVIE REALLY IS SHOT IN BLACK & WHITE AND NOT IN COLOR AS BEING MARKETED BY THE DISTRIBUTION COMPANY. NEVER THE LESS THE PICTURE TRANSFER IS VERY CRISP & STILL FUN TO WATCH FOR THE ACTORS & THE STORY.",1300924800,,1108,4.994594594594594
