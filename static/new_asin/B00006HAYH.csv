7968667,1,B00006HAYH,"To be honest, I bought this because Ava Lake was in it.  Huge mistake.  While there are a couple scenes where Ava and her fellow actresses shed their clothing, they're only about a half minute in length.

The most annoying part was the slow motion.  A scene would begin in slow motion, go to regular motion, and back to slow again, all in the span of a minute or two.  At first I thought my DVD player was flaking out.

The flashbacks were also endless.  How many times do we need to see that guy shuffling the cards?  Was I supposed to forget about the poker game the first two times I saw it?

The plot of this may have been enjoyable if I could keep track of what was going on, but these flaws just completely ruin it, by distracting your attention.

The DVD is lacking.  Sure, there's a menu, but the only option on it is ""play movie"".  No scene selection, no extras.

Do yourself a favor, and forget about this flick.",1108425600,4,922,4.2298850574712645
