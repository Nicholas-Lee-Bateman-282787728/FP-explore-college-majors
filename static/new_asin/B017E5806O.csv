7502036,5,B017E5806O,"I was extremely worried of this movie being dumbed down to try to appeal to children. Like Minions, and many others tend to do. But instead, they took the high road. They chose quality over box office. Which is a not something they do with franchises these days. But remember, Peanuts is the exception, not the rule. You should be worried when you see a CGI reboot of your favorite franchise. They will ruin your childhood. They will modernize it. They will bastardize everything you hold sacred to make a quick buck. Peanuts is the one CGI reboot that comes in a lifetime, that doesn't compromise it's integrity. But don't expect that to happen ever again anytime soon.",1449792000,20,670,4.686440677966102
7502037,5,B017E5806O,"As a 40-something year old couple, my wife and I were concerned about some of the things mentioned by other reviewers. We were concerned that it was modernized to a point where all the kids would be texting, and trying to be cool by today's standards. Instead, the movie was refreshing in very much the way it should be. Beyond the fact that we like that, our 4 year old daughter love the movie as well, and is now excited about Peanuts, Charlie Brown, and of course, Snoopy. I wasn't too excited about the 3d, but then again, most of the time I find it not worth it; but as far as the story and content, that movie is excellent.",1449792000,2,629,4.25
7502038,5,B017E5806O,"By now, we all know that CGI reboots are notorious for destroying a great brand's legacy, for the sake of making a quick buck. AKA, selling out. And given the horrendous track record of CGI cartoon reboots, I was certain this movie would ruin my childhood. But 'The Peanuts Movie' is the one exception to the rule.

I was skeptical about this this movie going into it. The obvious red flag was the CGI. I thought, ""Oh no. They're modernizing it."" It won't be long before we see Charlie Brown twerking. All the kids texting, and using emojis. Speaking in hashtags. All while trying to become YouTube celebrities.

But thankfully none of that happened. They stayed true to classic peanuts. Even the CGI was spectacular. And this is coming from the biggest CGI cynic you'll ever meet. They managed to create a brand new art-form in the making of this movie. They took something three-dimensional, and managed to make it two-dimensional. And very beautiful, might I add.

As someone who grew with the Peanuts, and is so numb from seeing their childhood get destroyed so many times with awful CGI adaptations, I really had a good time watching this movie. It truly put a smile on my face, and I was quite pleased with it. This is, without a doubt, the best movie of the year.",1449792000,5,1270,4.610619469026549
7502039,5,B017E5806O,"To say I am a fan of Charles Schulz's Peanuts is a complete understatement.  I'll always fondly remember Charlie Brown continuously getting a rock for Halloween, and Linus's blanket, but I love all the Peanuts characters quite honestly.  So seeing this movie was an absolute necessity for myself.

And though I was admittedly skeptical, I left the theater with a smile. Seeing Charlie, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, Franklin, and the rest of the gang adapted on-screen was a real treat for a fan like myself. The plot involves all your favorite characters and revolves primarily around Charlie having a crush on the sweet Little Red-Haired girl.

When I watch an animated movie, I expect two things 1. For it to retain the innocent childlike qualities on which it sets out to achieve 2. be entertaining for both kids and adults.  Number 2 is important because as adorable as little children are, they can't pay the price of admission!

The Peanuts movie has that childhood adventure and quality that will bring out the kid in everyone who watches the film. While watching The Peanuts movie, there were numerous times I was reminded of why these characters are so special and why even today they hold such an impact.

And the animation (for today's generation) is done exceptionally well in The Peanuts Movie. Pig-Pen is still as dirty as ever, and Snoopy still looks as recognizable as ever.

More importantly, I love how The Peanuts Movie has a lesson for both kids (and as a guy who is currently crushing on a girl right now and is still admittedly a bit shy) and adults to take to heart. It never fails to stay true to Charle Schulz's stories, nor does it cease to entertain. I'd gladly see The Peanuts Movie again and again, and it is one of my favorite animated movies released this year.",1449705600,109,1784,4.69551282051282
7502040,5,B017E5806O,"This movie exceeded all my expectations. As a 42 year old couple, we weren't sure if this movie would hurt or help this classic franchise. I was blown away at how good this was... it was exactly as you would expect that it should be... It is Peanuts, and I didn't want to see it modernized to a point where it loses what made it so great. Fortunately, this movie was excellent. My 4 year old daughter loved it too!",1449705600,58,414,4.1875
7502041,5,B017E5806O,So glad they didn't reinvent Charlie Brown. I love the old cartoons and love this one too. Wonderful family friendly movie. Just what we've come to know and love from the Peanuts gang.,1449619200,2,184,4.606060606060606
7502042,4,B017E5806O,"Good Grief! This feature is similar to ""You're in Love, Charlie Brown."" It includes all the cliche bits we have seen a dozen times before. BTW I have never really warmed up to Woodstock which they insist on putting into the film.

I loved the old cartoons, and indeed they attempted to use similar voices. In that regard they did fairly decent except for Charlie Brown and Lucy, the two main characters. The film starts out in winter and seems days later it is the middle of summer. The film avoids all holiday or religious themes as Chuck does a book report on ""Leo's Toy Store"" by Warren Peace.

The theme is that Charlie Brown is a good man with good intentions under all of his ""failures"" and that is what is important. It was so much like what was already done, I was not overly entertained. 3 1/2 stars",1449273600,,808,4.38

7502090,4,B017E5806O,"Charles Schultz' Peanuts characters are perfectly captured in this film. Unfortunately, the film is a little on the long side and drags in places. Artistic quality from Blue Sky meets the same standards they had with Ice Age. This is the typical insecure Charlie Brown story that occupied the comic strip for all those years. The red-haired girl moves in across the street and poor Charlie is in love, but so insecure that he fumbles all over himself, more than he usually does. Snoopy also has a live interest from France as he battles the Red Baron. I won't reveal anything else, other than to say that by the end of the film, everything is okay with Charlie, Snoopy and the rest of the gang. Good family entertainment. Four stars because it drags in places and could have been shortened by removing some of the padding.",1521763200,,822,4.636986301369863

7502115,5,B017E5806O,"This was our household Christmas movie this past Holiday. This is the best movie I have seen in a long while. Period

Everyone of us enjoyed it immensely. Not only the producers and animation artists did an incredible job with the type of computer design and animation they chose but the dialog is right on spot, the timing for the jokes and their delivery is immpecable, the jokes are laugh hard funny and it never lost pace. And they also got a fantastic soundtrack with the classic PEANUT's melodies all the fans know and new excellent vocal scores that refresh the beloved music album of these classic characters.

The story is simple yet entertaining and very catchy for adults and children alike.
So are the new soundtrack themes which we ended up playing a lot all the way to New Year's eve.

There is a lot of extra content, some of which are a must for collectors and fans of the PEANUT ensemble specially some shorts about its creator work, Mr. Charles Schultz (r.i.p).

My wife and I are fans of these characters. I have a few CD's with music from the original series and movies. A few years ago we gave our children a CD collection which contained a large aggregate of the original animated movies (from the 60's) just to see if they liked it. They treasure it and watch it very often. So everybody in our house was earnestly and eagerly awaiting to get and watch this movie for Christmas since we missed its original theatrical release.
This is palpable proof of the timelessness of these characters and the transgenerational allure of their stories.

The movie is so well sorted out that it either contains references, or elements or even entire sections belonging to or connecting with classical stories of the Peanut characters but they are all so masterfully arranged and cleverly intertwined that the story flows smoothly and progressively.
Frankly I was happily surprised since a sketchy story made up of compartamentalized sections forcibly connected together is most commonly the result of movie making efforts of this kind.
But NOT HERE, and that is a great tribute both to the work of the original creators of PEANUTS and to each man and women involved in making this fine film.

The editing of picture and sound is flawless also. This movie is a triumph.

The main goal of a movie is to entertain and that's what you get here : pure great entertainment for all ages.
I enjoyed thoroughly, laughed my heart out together with my wife and kids, but the best joy comes from my youngest kid, who is seven and asks to play it practically everyday.
This is the gift that keeps on giving. Get a copy, you will be glad you did.

I've been a HUGE fan of the Peanuts comic strips for decades and so has my wife, so when this movie came out we went to see it in the theater.  We really didn't know what to expect but we hoped to see The Peanuts Gang in all their glory, each member with their own individual quirks, and maybe some of the old but favorite Schulz gags.  This movie did not fail to disappoint on any level.

I knew it was going to be good 20 seconds into the movie.  The 20th Century Fox logo comes up, you hear the drum roll, and then (perhaps unexpectedly) you hear the musical fanfare being played on piano.  As the logo spins around, you see Schroeder playing the fanfare.  VERY clever.

According to the special features, they based the appearance of the characters on the circa 1980's Peanuts comic strips.  It's readily apparent the animators went into painstaking detail to get the look right -- and to bring a three-dimensional look to them.  It worked.  You really can see the Peanuts characters ""coming to life"" in this movie.  You can also see the amount of work that went into getting the backgrounds looking right.  In short, the visuals are fantastic.

The storyline starts with a ""snow day"" where the Peanuts Gang goes out to play hockey -- except for Charlie Brown, of course.  He decides to fly his kite.  Hey, the kite-eating-tree has lost all its leaves and is hibernating for the winter, so it makes sense in a Charlie Brown way, right?  The story then continues through the school year and ends on the day class is released for summer vacation.  Along the way, you see Charlie Brown weave his way through numerous situations (and numerous foibles) as he vies for the attention of The Little Red Haired Girl, who moved into town on that ""snow day"" where the story starts -- but we don't find that out right away, of course...

The best part of this movie is we get to see Snoopy in action as The World War I Flying Ace.  They devoted an entire back-story to this premise, and yes, we get to see the dog house (a.k.a. Sopwith Camel) fly.  We get to see Snoopy attempt to romance Fifi (who flies an actual plane), get into dogfights with The Red Baron (GREAT action scenes) and we also get to see Snoopy save the day and rescue the girl -- along with some help from Woodstock and his bird pals.

As for the Charlie Brown storyline, we see Snoopy try to teach Charlie Brown practicing magic for a talent show and learning how to dance (HILARIOUS bit where Snoopy does the Flamenco and Charlie Brown responds with The Chicken Dance), we see Charlie Brown get the highest score on the yearly standardized test -- or so it seems, we see him pull an all-nighter doing a book report by himself because his partner -- The Little Red Haired Girl -- had to leave town due to a family emergency, and of course there are some great classic bits of Charlie Brown getting shellacked while playing baseball and trying to fly his kite.

What's not to like?  Well, some people have written less-than-praiseful reviews because -- SPOILER ALERT -- Charlie Brown gets The Little Red Haired Girl (she volunteers to be his pen-pal over summer vacation).  Apparently this rubbed a lot of Peanuts fans the wrong way because they believe Charlie Brown is and always should be a perpetual loser.  Some have even given the opinion that the movie falls in line with the new-age thinking ""Everyone is a winner"" so the producers HAD to make Charlie Brown win in the end.

I would say the people giving these opinions have really missed a significant point in this movie.  Yes, Charlie Brown has more than his share of stupendous screw-ups throughout the course of the movie, but he demonstrates a lot of positive qualities like honesty, integrity, giving his best effort for the team, putting others before himself, etc.  THESE are the things that The Little Red Haired Girl liked about Charlie Brown.  Is that a bad thing?  Don't you think there's a valuable lesson for children there?

In short, if you're like me and my wife and still enjoy watching the Peanuts holiday specials, you're going to LOVE The Peanuts Movie.  If you have children, this is a very good, very wholesome movie with a few things that might be mildly scary but usually have a comedic payoff.  So I think it's safe to say this movie has something for everyone -- except the people who get sour grapes over anything good happening to Charlie Brown...",1513900800,4,4437,4.559343434343434

7502143,3,B017E5806O,"I'm afraid I have to be the 'blockhead' in the bunch and call out the negative points in this film. They did a lot right with it, and that makes it almost makes me sad to have to call it like I see it. The timing is off. In the original cartoon films, it was the pacing that allowed you to reflect with the characters that made it endearing. Here there is no time for that. They are constantly racing you from one scene to the next, jamming in so many references to the original films that you feel bombarded. Sometimes it goes to even greater extremes to get more scenes per second.

In one scene, while the talent show is happening, they throw us smack in the middle of no less than 5 different typical Peanuts scenarios for nostalgic value and literally before you even have a second to register it, they are accelerating you into the next while the one you're watching is still going on. It felt awkward and off putting, and that isn't the only example. In the scene that borrows from A Charlie Brown Christmas where they are all dancing, they give you all of 5 seconds of it. JUst when you start to smile and say 'hey, nice touch adding the ....' you don't get to finish what you're excited to see. Early on, there is the ice skating pond but I guess they thought the viewers didn't want to see the characters skating so they thrust us into a moment that should have come after they had a chance of introducing us to and establishing the characters. It just felt like that whole scene didn't go thru proper planning when they were in the storyboard phase at the studio.

Another thing they did was borrow too heavily from past Charlie Brown film and comic strip material. With decades worth of impeccable comic strips, surely they could have sprinkled the film with bits that haven't been in other Peanuts films before.

Plus, even when they do add something new and interesting to the Peanuts world, they don't capitalize on the emotion of the moment. After a school assembly, where he is deemed a hero for getting 100% on a standardized test, Charlie Brown is once again brought down by the grim reality that he wasn't actually as smart as he thought, but instead of capitalizing on the sentimental moment, letting the viewers empathize with his plight, we are whisked off into 'the next thing we want you to focus on for only about 10 seconds.

There are clever moments like Linus's plane that he uses as a device to introduce his report on the Red Baron becoming a running gag in the film, but such a gag feels out of place and a device to get a laugh that may be more at home in other children's movies.

One thing they got right about 90% of the time is Snoopy's ability to steal the show and get big grins and laughs at moments when other things are happening. That was one trademark of the Peanuts franchise I was glad to see they were able to modernize fully intact.

I do think that with a little more work on slowing things down and a bit of polishing, if they do another Peanuts movie in this style, they could have a proper modern rendition of the classic world of Peanuts we have all grown up loving.

The bottom line is that if YOU as an adult love the Peanuts classics, expose your kids to those before or instead of watching this. Maybe the second time around for a modern Peanuts film won't leave us old fans saying 'Good grief''",1511481600,,3352,4.370786516853933

7502163,4,B017E5806O,"When I heard that Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang were going to be made into a 3D Computer Animated film, I wanted to cringe. The PEANUTS comic strip been one of my all-time favorite comic strips for decades. I grew up with it, and I still like reading it. I enjoyed the Charlie Brown holiday specials year after year. I was certain that the makers of this movie would do something to Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, and the others in a way that I wouldnt be too happy about. But when I saw the trailer in the summer of 2015 I began to wonder if they might actually pull it off.

After seeing the movie, I am happy to say that they did. THE PEANUTS MOVIE is a delightful film that clearly remembers a lot about the legendary comic strip and the characters were all familiar with. The 3D animation gives us additional things that have never been seen in the Peanuts gang, such as texture in clothing, and almost lifelike hair in the characters. All the characteristics we remember from the gang are here: including Linus security blanket, Lucys crush on Schroeder, who is still playing Beethoven, Sallys love for Linus, and Snoopy is still the World War I Flying Ace, battling against the Red Baron. And Lucy still pulls the ball away every time Charlie Brown tries to kick it. Adults are never seen in the film, and you only hear the familiar, Wah, wah, wah, sound when they speak to the character.

But THE PEANUTS MOVIE also takes all of those things and adds new angles. The movie gives us the Peanuts gang that actually looks at Charlie Brown differently. For decades, Charlie Brown believed that nobody likes him. Thats not the case here, although Lucy still seems to hold a grudge against him. She still refers to him as, you blockhead. Snoopy, as the Flying Ace falls in love with a female beagle pilot named Fifi, and is determined to save her from the Red Baron. Charlie Brown develops the familiar crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl, who moves across the street, but this time he is determined to win her heart. Lucy advises him from her familiar Psychiatric Help booth to demonstrate that he is a winner (for the usual 5 cents.) Charlie Brown then makes several attempts to win her over. First, he creates a magic act for the talent show. Believing that this attempt failed, he discovers that she likes dancing, and Snoopy coaches him on how to dance. Last, when assigned to do a book report with her as a partner, Charlie Brown completes it all by himself while she is away for a week. (It is a sense of irony that the book he chooses is the same one that was assigned to him in the Peanuts TV special: HAPPY NEW YEAR, CHARLIE BROWN.)

Every attempt is a failure to Charlie Brown, who believes they were disasters that she happened to witness, but there is something buried underneath all of them, and that Charlie Brown has special qualities that he never knew he had. And it is these qualities that elevate him to a new level, and show the rest of the gang how special he actually is. One quality Charlie Brown always had in the decades that the Peanuts comic strip has existed is determination. No matter what happens to Charlie Brown, whether he is tangled in the Kite Eating Tree, knocked off the pitchers mound so hard his clothes come off, or lands on his back after Lucy pulls the ball away, he doesnt quit. He just tries again and again.

Watching THE PEANUTS MOVIE, it is clear that director Steve Martino understands the world of Peanuts through and through. The screenplay was co-written by Charles Shultzs two children, and it also becomes clear this is a fitting tribute to their father. The movie even has a catchy song that is played when Snoopy trains Charlie Brown on how to dance. One other critic complained that the movie doesnt break any new ground with the Peanuts gang; it just continues what everyone remembers from the film. That is probably true, but I find it a relief that it doesnt muck up the series, or the characters. I believe that if Charles Shultz were alive today he wouldve loved the film.",1506729600,,4053,4.510204081632653

I have been searching for a full-time career for nearly 3 years now, and it is easily to become discouraged and fall into a negative mindset. Charles Schulz understood those struggles and gave us the ever persistent Charlie Brown to endure the hardships of failure and loneliness. He will certainly get down on himself at times, but he will return the next day with a new bout of confidence. This movie portrayed the importance of persistence, honesty, and compassion, as well as being extremely faithful to the source material. It may have a happier ending than what we usually get from a Peanut comic strip, but it feels appropriate.",1506384000,,679,4.762711864406779

Apart from the nostalgia of being transported back to my childhood again what I love most about these cartoons is the pure simplicity and decency of them.  I just love everything about these cartoons.  The imagery, the quaint small town, the characters (Lucy, Schroeder, Linus, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, Snoopy and of course Charlie Brown), and even the unintelligble sounding adults.  Everything about these cartoons exudes happiness, simplicity and purity.  One of the minor issues I have had with these cartoons in the past is that it wasn't inclusive enough.  In this release the producers did include more diversity in the student body of the school and I think they deserve kudos for doing that.  Certainly the main characters in the peanuts gang are the same as they have always been and I would not have it any other way.

7502258,5,B017E5806O,"When you have the ability to make a film based on some of the most legendary characters for a whole new generation, what do you do? YOU DO NOT CHANGE A THING!

The Peanuts Movie give every true Peanuts fan one of the greatest Peanuts stories ever. The film is so delightful, filled with imagination and all the innocence of childhood. This film fits perfectly with all of the other animated Peanuts films and specials given to us for the last 4 decades. The voice cast was on par with all the past films and specials. The animation from Blue Sky was so beautiful with a very unique blend of CGI and 2-D animation through thought bubbles and other effects to make it look like the legendary comic strips.

I have no idea how this film got totally overlooked at the Oscars because I thought that it was a true tribute to the legendary Charles Schultz who gave us these amazing characters. However, that is just me. Either way I love this film and I am so glad I own it.",1486598400,,967,4.337016574585635

I had cautious optimism when I learned they were doing a modernized full length movie, as it could have gone either way... but they did an excellent job. Each character was handled with care and is true to who Charles Schultz created. The story line is adorable. So many little hidden gems from all the original TV specials can be found throughout. And all of it done while updating the look and flow of the film to match some of the best kids movies from the last 15 years. This is so well done I was quite literally choked up several times throughout.

side note: I loved how they were able to properly  fill in the holes to keep the right feel for the neighborhood. The little houses look just like those found in the St. Paul neighborhood where Charles Schultz grew up.",1483315200,3,842,4.356687898089172

If you missed it in the theaters becasue you were afraid it wasn't going to be a true Charlie Brown classic, I did too. I give it 5 stars becasue this adaptation of the classic Peanuts cartoon is true in every way.

I was afraid they were going to modernize the characters such the characters using cell phones, texting etc. As a reader of the classic cartoon itself and enjoying the TV specials I was was pleasantly surprised by this movie. This is the classic brought to life with modern film making. Charlie Brown is a great character and they do him justice in this movie.",1482883200,5,683,4.377952755905512

Simply put it's a gorgeous recreation of the original look using modern animation and somehow it just all works (I for one was sure it wouldn't but it really really does.) It also knows to keep things fairly low key, because that's what Peanuts is. The Red Baron sequences are used to up the scale, but since that's all Snoopy's fantasy it doesn't feel too crowbarred in. Overall it is more of a series of smaller segments strung together than an overall narrative, but that's what Peanuts is good for anyways, so I think it was the right call to make.",1482105600,,647,4.445378151260504

7502597,4,B017E5806O,"I admit, i was skeptical of this movie before giving it a watch. I rented this on itunes when it became available and was pleasantly surprised. I thought that maybe the animation would bother me but it was actually really good, especially on Blu Ray. The story/plot was solid and cute. It definitely has it's share of picking on Charlie Brown throughout the movie but that's why we always root for him. The story itself was predictable but that doesn't always make for a poor movie. Snoopy got all the laughs. He has a side story within the movie, almost like a movie within a movie but done well enough to where you're not forgetting the main theme. He and Woodstock were great together. The film was, of course, filled with all the typical character quotes that have been heard for decades but well balanced.

Overall, i'd say that this film was done with respect to Shulz. I believe he would've enjoyed it very much. The only downside, for me, would've probably been wanting a different season setting and some discrete adult humor thrown in, as they do with most successful animated films.
This had a Winter setting which makes me feel like it's a winter movie to me.",1476662400,,1171,4.6028708133971294

7502652,4,B017E5806O,"Honestly, these days there have not honestly been very good animated films that have drove upon the past inspirations, and when they have they just have not been able to sparkle the way the originals have done. What I have seen with films recently like Disney's Inside Out and Toy Story 3, I did not enjoy them because the films weren't stronger from the heart alone. There are some films that I have liked, because they are among the wild and wacky nuts of comedy, like Minions with the sidekicks from Despicable Me, which was loud of loud funny and showed a beautiful side from the loony sidekicks. But there are some that draw from the past well. One example is when I had watched The Peanuts Movie, which Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and company bring back the charm that made the long-lasting classic comic strip by the great Charles Schulz, as a new generation's trip to the past, and it is definitely a novel and adorable treat.

The Peanuts Movie tackles the inspiration from the classic comic strip well. As it reflects on the classic animation, teaming up with the studio that conjured Ice Age and takes on a new, old school charm that hasn't been touched since Schultz' s tragic retirement and shocking death in 2000 from cancer. The movie works very nicely and brings in the Frozen era, to a world when animation was just drawn at hand. The films shows the story of Charlie Brown, trying to accomplish one of his deepest goals, winning over the little red hair girl in the neighborhood, but becoming a laughing stock many times over his peers and classmates at the end. He does numerous good deeds, which have backfired from assisting in a book report for her, while dealing with her grandmother's illness, giving up his act in the talent show so he can make his sister Sally win and feel the top prize, to holding onto one of her pencils that she accidentally drops in class, and uses it as a sign that he is stronger than a nobody. The gang brings in the classic jokes and Peanuts charm from older comics like Charlie Brown getting beaned by a wild pitch on the mound in the snow, to Snoopy writing a story about battling the Red Baron, risking his life to save the dog of his dreams. It really is a lovely feel good film, with the aid of Charles Schulz's kinfolk helping with the story line, and vintage tunes from the original Peanuts series and specials like Lucy & Linus and Christmas Time Is Here.

Overall, what I had liked about The Peanuts Movie, is that it is a great animated movie, that does the job at letting the Frozen generation of children, take a trip back to what classic cartoons were like, and celebrate the generations before of the classic Charlie Brown & Snoopy charm. If you have loved watching the classic Peanuts specials over the eras like You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown, or Snoopy's Reunion, than you'll absolutely love watching The Peanuts Movie, and it shows what Charles Schulz had always made Charlie Brown. Even the most unsung disgraced person, can be the most beautiful human being at the end of the day. I sincerely recommend this movie.

7502664,5,B017E5806O,"Where oh where do I begin? From the cover art, at first glance I thought this movie would be completely terrible. It looked so saccharine-sweet that it would be unbearable. I've never been a huge fan of the Peanuts comic strip, but I used to watch the animated films as a kid because I was only allowed to watch The Disney Channel and that's what was on. Those films were filled with depressing storylines, slightly mean-spirited mania, and instrumental musical numbers that went on way too long and left me wondering as a child if the animators were on depressants while making the films. I am happy to say that while the essence of the characters has been captured here, the overall downer tone of the previous animated films, and the mean heartless spirit of one zany Beagle (anyone else remember him abandoning Charlie Brown with no explanation? Acting totally aloof as Charlie struggled through life? Seemingly caring not-at-all about the feelings of his owner? Yeah, maybe only I remember that...) has been replaced with a movie filled with love, of the very best kind.

The Peanuts World

Yes, this film is set in the classic Peanuts world. The adults sound like you remember. Snoopy writes with his typewriter atop his dog house (which is also an airplane!). Peppermint Patty still calls Charlie ""Chuck"" and is his undeclared ""girlfriend"" (am I the only one who figures he grows up and marries his best friend?). Sally is a lovable space cadet. Marcie calls Peppermint Patty ""Sir"". Linus is obsessed with his blanket and Lucy is obsessed with Schroeder.  And yet...

Despite the familiar trappings, and the somewhat ordinary world inhabited by the Peanuts Gang, there magic everywhere. There's the good  old cartoon physics that let a kite carry a kid over a fence, a toy airplane that after taking off  flies endlessly, etc, etc. But just the same, the heart, spirit, and genuine LOVE in this film is pervasive.

A couple days before seeing The Peanuts Movie, I tried to watch Angry Birds. I quickly gave up on that film because I never laughed once and was bored out of my skull. Despite being set in the real world, the Peanuts film is endlessly entertaining, and consistently laugh-out-loud funny. I could not stop laughing. Yes, Charlie Brown suffers some disappointments, and for a kid like him they are doozies. But they aren't the devestating downers of the previous animated films (failing the spelling bee, having his dog abandon him, losing a sports event at the finish line). While they are the same type of events, the direction of the film doesn't dwell on the disappointments too long, and we feel like Charlie Brown's dog Snoopy actually cares about him, and his story is inspired by what his friend Charlie is experiencing, as if Charlie Brown is Snoopy's hero, and Snoopy wants to see him triumph. And speaking of Snoopy's story...

The Greatest Love Story Ever Told...

Yes, from the beginning of the story that Snoopy starts to write, it is obviously a parallel to Charlie Brown's story. That in of itself is a really cool storytelling device. What makes it AMAZING is that not only is this a film within a film (it actually feel a lot like the awesome recent release of the animated ""The Little Prince"", it is a gorgeous, action-packed film full of humor in it's own right. By the end of the film film the parallels were amazing, and my heart was soaring.

A film to own

Honestly, if you love the positive side of the Peanuts stories, it would be hard to not love this film. And if, like me, you found the previous animated releases too much of a downer you should still give this film a try. Charlie Brown may be the ultimate loser, but in this film losers finish first when they have a heart of gold. Charlie Brown always does the right thing (he faces some genuine moral quandaries admirably,, and there is no ""dark side"" to this film), and when you see the effects of that build to a climax in his young mind, I think it's impossible not to be touched by the emotional payoff.

The downside of this film is that it's loaded with predictable situations and re-used plot devices. Every Peanuts trope is used, and just about every imaginable film plot device as well (switched exams, inability to confess a crush, jealousy of another's achievements, riding on another's success, chasing after someone to confess your feelings, etc, etc), but every one of these obvious steals of familiar ideas is executed with wondrous simplicity and wide-eyed innocence.

In the end, the only downside of this film is easily forgiven because it's such a well-made film with such good intentions. After seeing this film I love it's cover. Because it's not sugary-sweetness just for toddlers. It's how the two main characters really feel about each other, and the inspiring heart-felt glue that holds this film together.

Review:  As a lifelong fan of The Peanuts, in all its incarnations, I had a flutter of joy when I heard they were making a brand new 3D computer animated film, which was quickly followed by a sense of dread.  Hollywood does not have a great track record with modernizing shows from our childhoods (Transformers, Land of the Lost, etc.).  Generally they rip the heart and soul out of it, especially when it was a family friendly and morally upright franchise.  However, this movie shows that you can maintain the integrity of the original, pay homage to its origins, and modernize it all while creating a highly successful movie.

The creators created a story line that stayed true to the roots of Peanuts but was fresh and not rehashed.  It remained simple and poignant.  Charlie Brown isn't suddenly walking around with an iPod strapped to his head or anything like that, giving the movie a timeless feel that is eminently relatable.  Where some of the original TV specials and movies could sometimes feel like a series of daily comic strips strung together; this story has a very fluid feel, remaining cohesive all the way through.  It is wonderful story of fitting in and learning to love and loose love.

A quick thought on the movement to computer animation.  For a stubborn purist this will cause great consternation.  However, when looked at as a progression and evolution of the tools, this is a great thing.  The animation itself resembles that of the hand-drawn originals, but gives the whole things a fresh new look that will hopefully help introduce it to an entirely whole new generation.

I highly recommend this film for fans, or anyone looking for a great family movie they can watch again and again without fear of content being questionable.  While it doesnt stray into that the adults will get this joke kind of approach, it is appealing to all ages.",1472083200,,2110,4.75

After receiving my copy I watched it with two teen age grand-daughters, then with the three year grandson. It's a pleasure no matter your age.

Anyway, any Peanuts fan will enjoy this movie.  Especially if you enjoy Charlie's crush on the little red haired girl. It was super adorable. Actaully, it was every iconic thing I remember from Peanuts. Perfect little movie!",1471392000,,490,4.258064516129032

She'd rather watch this movie than watch TV. It has something for adults, older kids, and kindergarten aged children. The music is good, and it has a nostalgic element for those adults who watched The Peanuts as a child.",1470960000,,483,4.148936170212766

7502832,5,B017E5806O,"Absolutely LOVED this movie. I am extremely critical when it comes to new movies. I have little good to say about 90% of new releases, especially when it comes to 'kid's movies'. I hesitated to let my kids watch this because they love the old Charlie Brown movies, and I figured in this new adaptation, the writers would have Charlie sitting around on his Xbox. I also expected a load of sarcastic adult humor. This movie was brilliantly made. They managed to update it slightly in the animation itself, but they held onto the spirit of the Charlie Brown movies. It's bursting with scenes of all the children outside playing, and having fun together. They are the same creative and intelligent kids that they are from the old ones. The one thing that they DID change I thought was brilliant as well. At the end, Charlie comes out a winner!!! I won't say more so I don't spoil. If you are hesitating on this, don't. But it. or rent it. oh and by the way.....my kids love it as well, and it has become one of their top favorites, and they still love to watch the old ones as well!!!",1469664000,,1080,4.405

This is bad, but where it gets worse is when you see an appropriate end to the movie it picks right back up to a new story. If you're like me you cursed the movie and wanted nothing more than to turn it off. If your also like me you had no choice but to endure it to the end.

7502931,5,B017E5806O,"This movie was our family's ""pizza and a movie"" choice. Right from the very beginning, the characters came out and just warmed our hearts. I just thoroughly enjoyed how the the graphics were so well done. Snoopy actually LOOKED FUZZY!!!  And Charlie Brown's few strands of hair was so nice. The kids loved every part of this show, but Snoopy and Charlie Brown were the stars of the show. Everything that Charlie Brown felt and said rang true in our kids' hearts: feeling insecure, feeling like a failure, feeling alone, feeling never good enough, feeling just plain ordinary. These are  things all of us feel some time in our lives. And Snoopy was just so over the top wonderful. We just loved that he, a dog, typed these great stories and chased the Red Baron everywhere.

Charlie Brown is able to overcome and be encouraged by such a great crowd of friends, even when they were mean.  Every part of our childhood Charlie Brown was stuffed into this movie: the ""wa wa"" adults, Linus' cleverness, Lucy's obnoxiousness, Schroeder's love for music, and of course, the football. This is such a keeper because it teaches the lesson that it's not always about how you feel about yourself. You do have friends that support you, and the little red haired girl is just a heart stealer.  After this movie, we were just thanking Charles Schulz for being so genuine in his characters.",1468454400,,1373,4.704166666666667

If you remember, he was called stupid and a blockhead a lot in the older cartoons, they really stayed away from that in the new movie, which I'm ok with. You'll recognize the same story type lines, like the red baron, the little red head girl, Lucy and her advice booth, and very familiar quotes.

The animation looks spectacular, and the movie itself includes many vignettes from classic Peanuts stories. Fun for all ages. There are basically two story lines happening: Charlie Brown trying to work up the courage to address the new red headed girl next door, and Snoopy's fantasy story about taking on the Red Baron. I've read reviews of people saying they think the story leaves something to be desired or is confusing, and I'm not sure how that is the case. It's no War and Peace, but it has some fun and lighthearted storytelling as well as some of the classic Peanuts bits.",1467590400,,663,4.6752136752136755

7503040,5,B017E5806O,"I've always had mixed feelings regarding Charlie Brown and the ""Peanuts"" comic and TV specials.  On the one hand, Charlie Brown is a sympathetic and wholly relatable character, and his friends, from Snoopy to Linus to Peppermint Patty, are a cast of characters with fun personalities and believable interactions.  On the other hand, sometimes it can be downright depressing watching Charlie fail constantly at whatever he does, and after awhile seeing our wishy-washy but determined ""blockhead"" get so relentlessly ground into the dirt is just painful rather than any measure of entertaining.  So though I was like much of the rest of the world in worrying about how a CGI ""Peanuts"" movie would turn out, I was merely curious and not deeply invested in said movie.

All that said... I greatly enjoyed ""The Peanuts Movie.""  It stays true to the look and feel of the classic comic strip and the animated specials, yet is entertaining and enjoyable enough for kids to enjoy as well as the adults who grew up with the strip.

A new kid has moved into Charlie Brown's neighborhood... an adorable red-headed girl whom Charlie is instantly smitten with.  He has hopes for gaining her attention, only to be reminded at every turn that he fails at everything he does.  He tries many ways to impress her, from competing in the school talent show to winning a dance competition to aiming for the highest score in the standardized tests.  His efforts are thwarted by sheer bad luck at every turn, but he's not about to give up...  Meanwhile, his imaginative and so-clever-he's-nearly-human beagle, Snoopy, is penning an epic tale that parallel's Charlie Brown's, a tale of a determined WWI pilot out to shoot down the Red Baron and win the affections of a spunky poodle named Fifi...

I'm sure many viewers were expecting this movie to be a smear on Charles M. Schulz's beloved series... but the movie was produced under the watchful eye of three of Schulz's children, and that close attention to faithfulness to the strip shows.  Despite the updated animation, this movie feels very close to the classic ""Peanuts"" specials, down to the piano music and the authentic children's voices (and the stuffy trombone honks substituted for adult voices).  And for those concerned that the movie would be larded with pop culture references at the expense of plot and character, don't worry -- the movie has almost no such references, deriving its humor from the character interactions and the gags made classic from the comics and specials.  The movie does take some time to explain things that the original comic took for granted, such as the history of the Red Baron and how a typewriter works, though I believe this is for the benefit of younger viewers who have never used a typewriter or studied WWI.

The CGI of the film is similar to the CGI of another hit spinoff movie, ""The LEGO Movie,"" in that it looks almost stop-motion instead of smoothly animated like a Pixar film.  Likewise, despite being CGI the film looks flat and 2D, closer to the older specials than a traditional CGI movie.  I actually enjoyed the animation, which looked far more faithful to the old comic than traditional CGI would have been.  There's some liberties taken with Snoopy's imagination sequences, which are more lushly rendered, but that helps set them apart from ""reality"" in my mind.

All in all, I feel this movie stayed very true to its roots, maintaining the feel, humor, and character interactions of its source material.  The attention to detail is amazing, and the story feels faithful to the old ""Peanuts"" strip while still maintaining a sense of sweetness and hope.  Both younger viewers and older fans of the original strip will enjoy this film, and for those worried that it will continue the tradition of setting Charlie Brown up to be knocked down again... well, I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say that even Charlie Brown deserves a break now and then, and this film manages to stay true to its source even while keeping a sweet and hopeful note.

Recommended for children 6 and up (the only possibly-objectionable material here is some fighter-plane action sequences, and even those aren't very scary), and for both devoted ""Peanuts"" fans and anyone else young at heart.",1466553600,,4262,4.865836791147994

7503137,5,B017E5806O,"This movie was better than expected.  The odd part was the movie was enjoyed more by the adults in the room than the kids.  The kids liked the silly parts of the movie but the adults in the room had the background knowledge for the inside Peanuts jokes and gags.  The kids today do not watch the Peanuts holiday specials and have no connection to any of the characters except for MAYBE Snoopy.  In fact, when I asked the kids, Snoopy was dominantly the favorite character with no other character being mentioned or even remembered.  It's a great ""G"" movie for the entire family and believe it or not, the adults will get more of a kick out of it.  Unfortunately, like the Muppets or any other nostalgia filled show, the audience that is loyal is older because our kids are not growing up with these characters and honestly, they do not connect to many of these characters at all.  Rent it unless you are a huge Peanuts fan, then buy it.",1465257600,,936,4.406976744186046

7503166,5,B017E5806O,"Being it 35 years since their last animated movie, the Peanuts gang is back in their first film featuring the title of their comic strip. Blue Sky Studios took a break from doing Ice Age sequels to make this 3-D CGI feature-length production and latest animation featuring Chuck and the gang outside of insurance commercials. This acted as a retake of the stories, not acting as a continuation from any previous works.

 Charlie Brown is a young balding boy who despite having a decent group of friends and an overly-imaginative beagle named Snoopy, he suffers from low self-esteem. The arrival of a new neighbor/schoolmate referred to as the Little Red-Haired Girl give Charlie Brown the determination to get her to notice him. This goes from trying to win the school talent show, and working with her on a book report. Most of his efforts go fall to either Charlie helping out his sister, or loosing his book report to a model airplane. Snoopy meanwhile tries to write his own story of himself as a WWI flying ace patrolling for the infamous Red Baron who kidnapped his imaginary love interest Fifi(voiced oddly enough by the movie's only celebrity voice actor, Kristen Chenoweth). Charlie Brown does eventually gain the attention of the Little Red-Haired Girl, but just as she's going away for summer camp.

The Peanuts Movie works as a perfect time capsule for the entire print run of the original comic strip, as its could take place during anytime in the last 50 years, not alluding to anything specifically recent or trendy, making it very innocent and open to all-ages, also one of the few G-Rated mainstream movies to come out in a while. The CGI works great and achieves a significant stop-motion look to it. It stands out as a timeless modern day classic for fans of a simple story or something for the whole family.",1464912000,,1827,4.775316455696203

Part of the reason that the Christmas special is so well beloved is that Charlie Brown finally gets the recognition and respect he so deserves.  The same with this movie.  It is well paced to include Snoopy's adventures, and the story line follows the theme of the comic.  Nothing Charlie Brown tries to do works out the way he intends it to.  But in the end, that doesn't matter.  Very heartwarming movie.

Plus it was great to see Snoopy's WWI flying ace and Joe Cool!",1464393600,,586,4.462264150943396

But really, this is why I watch old movies and certain independent movies. Everything has to be politically correct....even Charlie Brown which was already for kids but obviously that wasn't good enough.

So let's turn Charlie Brown into a winner just like we give trophies to kids who finish in last place.....I'll stick to Charlie Brown Christmas ....Couldn't be bothered matching the voices either...I'm sure there was a politically correct reason for that too....

I won't be bothering with any sequels.....

7503295,1,B017E5806O,"Most modern animated movies entertain REALLY WELL for kids AND adults. This doesn't. I'm a Peanuts fan since childhood, but other than the Snoopy flying ace parts, this movie was awful.  Kids may like it, but IMO, it panders way too much for adults.

Worse, it has an ending that isn't true to the series. In today's modern PC culture, a kid can't be ""a loser,"" but that's what Charlie Brown is.  SPOILER: Charlie Brown (sort of) ""gets the little red-haired girl"" at the end. Does that sound right to ANYONE who grew up with the Peanuts? They might as well let him kick the damn football and pitch a shut-out too.

The Peanuts characters have their own weird look (Linus looks like a forceps baby, and unless he's at Dana Farber, why is a kid Charlie Brown's age bald with one hair?). They recreated that look, but the animation was not really up to the standards of Pixar or DreamWorks.  Snoopy's face in particular, actually LOOKED ""drawn"" on top of his slightly better-rendered animated body rather than being and integrated part of it.

Get/Rent Mr. Peabody & Sherman instead. It's fantastic (awesome animation) and has none of these problems. Both you and your kids will enjoy it a lot more.",1463097600,2,1196,4.644549763033176

I have, and always will love Snoopy and the Peanuts gang and this is an awesome tribute to an awesome comic strip! I was totally blown away by the 3D animation and realism of the entire movie! I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs several good laughs and even a few good cries! Yes, I admit it, I cried at the end when the little red-headed girl acknowledged Charlie Brown!

There was no added violence or adult humor slipped in to be ""edgy"". I hope there is more to come.",1462147200,,398,4.438356164383562

7503383,5,B017E5806O,"Can't praise this movie highly enough. We saw it in theatres with the kids and pre-ordered it almost immediately.

It manages to capture the essence of Charlie Brown. There are constant references back to the strip and previous TV specials, but it never attempted to replace any of them. It does perfectly what a new take on an established franchise should do; give nod to its predecessors while taking known characters somewhere new.

Our kids (6, 5 and 2) love this movie and for weeks would watch nothing else (until we started to introduce them to other Peanuts specials). They don't stop quoting parts of it. They love Snoopy in the Red Baron sequences the most, but they seem to have picked up some of the good life lessons in there too.

I love the fact that they decided to not force the gang into the modern world; children still played outside with friends, and not a cell phone in sight!  The 3D renderings worked well to keep younger viewers interested, but animation styles still mimicked the 6-7 actual positions the characters were drawn in to appease even the oldest fans.  Snoopy still is amazing, and it's wonderful to see them incorporate nods to his ""runaway fiancee"" Fifi from the strips into a unique story with the Red Baron.  Overall, it's a new interpretation of the classics and well worth the time of fans old and new.",1461628800,,695,4.710743801652892

The animation worked so much better than I ever thought it would, keeping to the original style remarkably well. For the story, it was also just wonderful. There's so much snark, edginess and/or darkness with so much of even kids' movies that it's refreshing to have something that's just straightforward and kind.

7503487,1,B017E5806O,"I actually really enjoy the classic specials.  So i was fairly excited to go into this movie, and be entertained.  I was wrong.  It meandered through its entire 'story,' and rehashed the cutest of jokes in a way that lost all of their sincerity, and charm.  The animation was interesting, as it was clearly CGI, but the facial expressions on the characters looked like the old classic animation.  This only begs the question, why was it done this way?  I can appreciate the effort done with this movie, but it was sadly boring.  It started out very cute, but as my mind began to wander, i realized that i should just stick with the originals.  I kept checking my watch, and hoping for something interesting to happen.  I do, however, hope that they don't quit trying to bring these characters back.  And the success of this movie is heartening.  I think this may have been an attempt to bring new audiences to characters who haven't seen much of the limelight of late.  I just hope that the next film realizes that they don't have to try so hard to be cute.  The original material is cute enough, and all you have to do is let the characters be true to themselves.

Sally is in love with Lucy's little brother and Lucy loves Amadeus...

I am sick of those things and it is not funny. The peanuts movie however has legit humor and it is great for everyone of all ages. I always liked the Peanuts, but this movie made me like them EVEN MORE!!!!!! It has a charming plot, fun characters and ACTUAL HUMOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The animation is gorgeous with new technology but still keeps the charm of the scorce material. In fact. This movie is more of a hour and a half special than a theatrical cartoon remake. It is great!!! It keep the charm of the original and Bareilly ""updated"" the movie. If it's not broke don't fix it and the movie followed these rules. Check it out, you won't feel disappointed.

7503599,3,B017E5806O,"We didn't get the chance to see this in theaters, and were wondering if we should buy it or not, so we rented it on Amazon Video.  I must say, streaming on Amazon Video is nice, much better than our cable company's Video on Demand service (so props to Amazon on the video department).

Our 3 year old daughter loves ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,"" and has memorized all of the main characters.  So I thought it would be nice to sit down and have a movie night, and enjoy a pleasant Peanuts movie together.

I grew up on Charlie Brown. I read their black and white comic strips in the daily paper back in the day, and looked forward to the colorful Sunday comic strips.  I had storybooks and cassettes that I listened to on my old Panasonic cassette player.  And of course, I always loved watching my three most favorite movies: ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,""  ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" and ""Race for your life, Charlie Brown.""

So why three stars?

Well, I have always been captivated at how Peanuts can be very comedic without being overly wacky.  Just the conversations between the gang alone creates a cartoon that makes it enjoyable for both adults and kids.
But I did not see that here.  For me, the ""charm"" of the Peanuts gang is their interaction with each other.  This movie seemed to be all about Charlie Brown, and way too much time on Snoopy's Red Baron sequences.  They should have edited some of those sequences out and just have them as a bonus feature.  Speaking of overly wacky, that's how I saw Snoopy in this film.  He had too much screen time, and it detracted from the main film.
I felt as if though this movie was trying to be too modern, meaning that the charming interactions between the Peanuts characters is replaced by high visuals, quick wacky animations (this seems to be the norm with CGI animations), and a plot that was very shallow.
I had a cassette tape about the story of Charlie Brown and the little red haired girl, and it was only 15 minutes.

I can say this though.  The voice acting was great!  Whoever did the voice of Linus deserves a medal.  Linus always spoke in such a way that is just cute.  The voice of Charlie brown was a little on the soft side, and Lucy was spot on.  The same can be said of Marcy, Peppermint Patty, and Sally. ""You owe me restitution!"" (great pumpkin reference)  :)
There were pleasant scenes that referenced the older movies, and I smiled when I saw them.

In the end, was this really a Peanuts movie?  In this day and age, probably.  30 or so years ago? I would think not.  And how is it that my 3 year old daughter would love a movie made in 1966, and get bored with one made last year?
The charm is lacking here.  If they continue with another movie, I do hope that they bring that back, and slow the pace down a bit.

I checked out the PEANUTS Movie from a library as soon as it was released to the public. I fell in love with this movie from the beginning of the film to the very end. Watching Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Woodstock, just to name a few, brought back memories of the PEANUTS comics. The animation made the characters look as if they were real! I did not want to turn this movie back in to the library. I, however, learned that WALMART were selling copies of the PEANUTS Movie for about $10.00 and I immediately bought a copy. Now, I have my own copy of the movie to look at over and over again. I hope a ""PEANUTS Movie 2"" is in the making. Truly Awesome!",1459900800,,789,4.266666666666667

7503645,3,B017E5806O,"What can I say about The Peanuts Movie? Let me get this out of the way firstdont expect any heavy or deep emotional experience here. Its a very simple movie about a seemingly perpetual loser named Charlie Brown, his prodigious beagle Snoopy, and their peers. As a matter of fact, the script feels like a composite stitched together from random bits and parts of the old television cartoons.

Nonetheless, the overall experience is actually a bit greater than the sum of the parts. The characters are memorable with Snoopy nearly stealing the show, the visual style beautifully blends the old scribbly look with the computer graphics, there are a few very funny moments, and the plots beats feel genuine in spite of how formulaic they might be in themselves. A friend who went with me to the theater thought that The Peanuts Movie was great.  I thought that it was decent. In the end, I can describe this as a sweet motion picture. Take along your children and introduce them to Charles Schulzs classic creations.",1459641600,,1012,4.777142857142858

7503649,3,B017E5806O,Bought the digital copy.  Expected it to be a better movie than it was but It is what it is.  The animation was amazing. Storyline was just not Peanuts Gang quality.,1459555200,,165,4.290322580645161
7503650,4,B017E5806O,"Steve Martino is a brave man. Sure, he directed the Dr, Seuss classic Horton Hears a Who! (2008) and Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012), the fourth installment in the Fox animated prehistoric series. But Charles Schulz is in a totally different league.

One of the most famous cartoonists of all time, Schulz received the Congressional Gold Medal for his influence on America culturean influence that famously extended into the U.S. space program, with the Apollo 10 command module named Charlie Brown and the lunar module named Snoopy. Over his career Schulz drew close to 18,000 Peanuts comic strips, published dozens of collected strips in books, and came into American homes through a series of now-iconic television specials, many of which were linked to holidays. And thats just the tip of the iceberg.

Upon his death, Schulz requested that his characters remain essentially unchanged, and The Peanuts Movie was to be the first time the characters were rendered in 3D CGI. In addition, the script was written by Cornelius Uliano and Schulzs son and grandson, who also had a hand in producing the film. But hey, no pressure!

Martino presides over a production that remains faithful to the spirit of the Peanuts world, choosing to surprise viewers not with twists or deviations, but with the clever rendering of familiar elements from the Peanuts gang repertoire and recognizable visual cues from the comics themselves. Snoopy hauls out his typewriter and takes to the skies atop his doghouse to fight the Red Baron, Charlie Brown is smitten by a new red-haired girl in the neighborhood, and everyone starts to think differently about failure-magnet, disaster-prone Charlie after he scores a perfect 100 on an exam.

In the end, the perceived messages about never giving up, the thin line that often separates failure from success, and the fickleness of public opinion come across loud and clearwhether you're an adult or a child. And universal messages like that are a big part of what has made the Peanuts adventures popular with all ages.

If The Peanuts Movie feels like a first, its only because its the first full-length animated feature to be produced for the big screen in 35 years. Its the fifth film, really, though this one feels like a first film because it introduces all of the familiar elements for a new audience. Yet, old ones will take delight in the way that those familiar elements are treated. Lucy is her old irascible self, setting up her psychiatric advice booth on the street in the middle of winterthough she could probably stand to see a shrink herself because of her self-image and anger-management issues. Pigpen doesnt have much to do, but his cloud of dirt appears every now and then. Schroeder is more visible with his Beethoven fetish and his toy piano, and Charlies sister Sally seems to lurk everywhere in the wings, like a real little sister.

Despite being set in winter, The Peanuts Movie manages to bring in all of the most famous bits, from Charlie Browns disastrous attempts at kite-flying to school talent shows, or from birdie Woodstock and Snoopys comic antics to and Charlie Browns dance lessons. The 3D CGI characters and stylized backgrounds seem perfectly melded by comic-strip wordless graphics like gigantic stars briefly flashed to signify an explosion or implosion, thought balloons, or eyes and eyebrows on a character that shift like drawings hovering over the CGI bodies. The effect is fairly mesmerizing and adds a charming uniqueness to the faithful tone and treatment of familiar material. The Peanuts Movie is one of the better 3D CGI animated adaptations in a sub-genre that sees far too many wrong turns and stinkers.",1459555200,8,3683,5.0

7503663,5,B017E5806O,"Like many people, I was skeptical about this movie when I first heard about it.  Charles Schulz has been dead and gone these sixteen years.  How could a new ""Peanuts"" movie possibly retain the spirit of the original comic strip?  I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  The computer animation takes some getting used to (for those of us that grew up on the classic ""Peanuts"" animation), but I thought the storyline was compelling enough.  It's basically an expanded version of the ""You're in Love, Charlie Brown"" special from the late 1960's.  Charlie Brown is enamored with the Little Red-Haired Girl, and he makes all kinds of attempts to impress her.  Of course, he inevitably makes a fool of himself every time.  I won't spoil it by giving away the ending, but it's a happy one.

The movie also contains a subplot that involves two of Snoopy's best-known personas: the world-famous novelist and the World War I flying ace.  Snoopy is writing a love story in which he imagines himself as a World War I pilot.  Between his attempts to rescue his sweetheart (an unnamed female beagle), he has run-ins with the infamous Red Baron.  It's probably not as funny as his adventures in the comic strip, but it's still pretty good.

I've been a ""Peanuts"" fan for more than forty years, and I've seen every one of their feature films.  ""Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown"" is still my favorite, but this one may very well come in second.  I just wish they'd given it a more creative title.",1459468800,,1485,4.636015325670498

7503671,5,B017E5806O,The Peanuts Movie is a wonderful movie for both children and adults.  We saw this movie with another family and I believe we adults appreciated it more than the kids.  The movie is a proud continuation of the Peanuts brand and did justice to Charles Schultz's body of work.  They did a great job of interweaving in Snoopy's fantasies (which have always been my favorite part) with the rest of the movie.  I would recommend this movie to those who want to have a good feeling of nostalgia and introduce their children to the Peanuts.,1459468800,,532,4.568421052631579

If you're an extensive fan of Peanuts, then most of the movie is a revisit of the many themes of all Peanuts history with a few lovely surprises.  The way it's all put together makes for a delightful visit down memory lane.  We look forward to adding a physical copy of this movie to our extensive collection of Peanuts.",1459296000,,399,4.5

For me, it wasn't hard to ignore all that and enjoy the story for being something Charles Schulz himself would have been proud to create. The Snoopy side story might have been my favorite part, but I enjoyed the movie very much. That said, I am 53 years old and a lifelong Peanuts fan. I'm not sure whether or not this is going to hold the interest of a generation that isn't familiar with the characters, though those who do stick with it will no doubt have fun going back and discovering the classic original cartoons.

7503842,5,B017E5806O,"From a comic strip that's been in publication for over 50  years now, to dozens of television specials and musicals, I think it's easy to say that there isn't a person in the world who doesn't know Charlie Brown. The timeless misadventures of the down-on-his-luck blockhead, along with his colorful cast of friends and faithful dog, Snoopy, has touched generations of people everywhere with it's down-to-Earth charm, good morals, imagination, and honesty. So when a movie was announced to commemorate the anniversary of Charles Schultz' trademark creation, many fans were cautiously optimistic. Would this film prove faithful to the comic strip, or dampen the franchise's glowing reputation?

I'm very happy to say the movie deserves every good review its gotten. It makes me wish that Schultz were still alive to see his creation be paid such a loving tribute to everything that made the comic strip great.

The story is rather simple. During winter break, Charlie Brown's school gets a new student--a pretty red haired girl whom Charlie instantly develops a crush on. Bound and determined to make a good impression on her, he tries his hardest to improve his social standing, from performing at the school talent show, to winning a dance competition, to getting a perfect score on a test. Meanwhile, his misadventures inspire Snoopy to pen a novel about his continuing imagined battle with the Red Baron. Will Snoopy finish his book? And will lady luck finally cut Charlie Brown a break? His dreams just might come true...but only when he learns that he just might already be a ""winner"" in ways he never thought of.

To anyone who's been a long time fan of the Peanuts, you won't be disappointed. The creators and animators behind this film were clearly on their A-game; doing their hardest to seamlessly insert as many references as they could to all the many infamous gags, characters, and moments from the comics and TV specials. From the music, to the Christmas Special, to the Great Pumpkin, to the Kite-Eating-Tree, to Lucy and the football, whatever noteworthy thing you can remember about Peanuts; more than likely, it's in here somewhere. And the animation deserves special mention. It's one of the most unique combinations of drawing styles I've ever seen.  Despite being CGI, the artists went through the trouble of making all the characters look just like the strip, and move in much the same fashion, with most angles remaining on a flat front or side view. Most of the 3-D details goes towards the backgrounds and giving everyone's hair and clothes (or fur) some texture. But in spite of all this, their faces (as well as thought balloons and sound effects) are done traditionally (or at least made to look like pen and paper).  This gives the film a VERY interesting art style I've never seen done before, and just adds to the overall charm.

All the characters we know and love are executed perfectly, with the voices sounding almost exactly like the classic voice cast. The only major change from the norm is that we finally get to see the face of the Little Red Haired Girl, as well as the Red Baron (or his plane, anyway). Which, speaking of, the dream sequences with Snoopy as the WWI Flying Ace are a lot of fun (while staying true to form and keeping his doghouse as a doghouse, and never showing what it looks like underneath while in the air). As for the plot, it plays out more like a series of separate little episodes all connected by a similar theme, which is perfectly fine, as most of the old TV specials were written in much the same fashion. Charlie Brown fails time and again, but he never gives up, and it's this determination that leads up to a poignant and heartwarming ending that proves that, for all that Charlie screws up, he's actually much smarter, braver, and more honest than he thinks he is. It's a life lesson that's needed now more than ever for today's generation.

If there's only one criticism I can give the film (and I'm really just grasping at straws here), it's that it's not really particularly funny. But then again, Peanuts was never rip roaringly hilarious to begin with. It played more for cute and charming, with just some chuckle-worthy moments, and likewise, the movie is the same way in its laid back tone--never going too fast or too slow, and never throwing gags at the screen to force a laugh. You won't find any pop culture jokes or updated technology here. Snoopy still uses his old fashioned typewriter, and the film is all the better for it.

So to anyone who wants to see the Peanuts gang given the proper justice, and/or just wants to see a feel-good film that'll put a smile on your face, this is your movie. It's simple, it's cute, and it's the perfect salute to one of the most infamous artists in comics.",1459123200,,4782,4.737980769230769

7503847,2,B017E5806O,"Rats!  I feel like Lucy set that football up for me and I just ran and tried to kick it, with the predictable result.

I learned to read on the Peanuts comic paperbacks of the 1960's, and I still have the collection.  Back then they were line drawings packed with heart and soul, and sometimes deep insight into the human condition.

Now they're rendered as computer animation -- which I thought cleverly combined old and new -- that nobody imagined back then, but they're just a string of slapstick sight gags strung together with a shallow derivative story that could have been told in a few minutes.  Many of the sight gags didn't even make sense.  Charlie Brown did not try to fly a kite or practice his baseball pitching in the snow.  Who would?

I don't remember a single meaningful dialogue between any two of the characters.  Even the Vince Guaraldi music, the same music several times, was dropped in there along with other kinds of music, not in such a way as to set a mood like with the classic Christmas special, but more like because it was expected, so it was thrown in there.

Great cartoons are written on two levels, one for the kids and one for the adults.  This is not one of those.

And then there's the Snoopy vs. the Red Baron movie-within-a-movie that took up a large part of the overall run time.  In the comic strip, Snoopy used to fantasize about being a WWI flying ace when he was bored, just hanging out on his dog house.  Now, the WWI story is a full blown waking hallucination that Snoopy experiences out-of-the blue while he is interacting with other characters, seemingly whenever he experiences empathy.

And, the WWI story is contrived to be some sort of unconscious way that Snoopy can vicariously pursue romance in his life the way Charlie Brown is experiencing it in the main story line.  Charlie is pursuing the Little Red Haired Girl (who is not longer mysterious to us because she is revealed right from the start) and Snoopy is pursuing Fifi the poodle-beagle across the war ravaged landscape of WWI Europe.

The one really good feeling I got was thankfulness that I didn't take a family to see it at the theater.

I'll bet whoever owns the rights to Peanuts is doing the Snoopy dance, but I'm just sitting here with a scribble cloud over my head.  Good grief!",1459123200,11,2301,4.54126213592233

7503877,5,B017E5806O,"I almost did not watch this latest Peanuts installment for fear that it would not live up to magic of the original movies and specials I grew up with as a kid.  I am a huge fan of Charles Schulz and have been since I saw my first Peanuts special on TV in the late 70's.  Between the excellent drawing, writing and the voices of the characters themselves, there was just something so unique and special about the Peanuts gang that I couldn't believe that could be captured in 2015.

Well, I am happy to say that this movie has every bit lived up to the Peanuts gang I remember from my childhood.  Even though technology has changed in animation, I can tell the studio has gone to great lengths to capture the essence of the original.  The positive story line, the fact that Charlie Brown is still the main character, complete with his self-perceived challenges.  Heck even the little red haired girl that makes Charlie Brown weak in the knees is included in the fun.  The folks behind the casting did a tremendous job searching for and finding child voice actors that are spitting images (vocally) of the original voices.

In a time when movie houses are remaking films, especially with prequels, back stories, and sub plots, it is refreshing to see this film stay true to the vision of Charles Schulz and carry on that tradition. I did a little research to see who wrote the movie and was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was Charles Schulz' son and grandson, which makes perfect sense to me now that I have seen it. When this movie ended I felt like I did when I was a kid, which is definitely saying a lot.  Thank you very much Schulz family for carrying on a great legacy.",1458691200,,1680,4.4462540716612375

7503885,5,B017E5806O,"I was not a huge peanuts fan growing up as a kid.  I thought the characters were mean to each other and jaded about life while still being in kindergarten.  Then I read some of Schultz's biographies, and I could see his hand in a lot of the kid's personalities and understand his thoughts behind them (BTW, if you ever get the chance to go to his museum and ice palace in Santa Rosa, it is so worth it!).  This movie is such an unexpected gem, though.  The themes of bravery, compassion, honesty, and perseverance shine through and, in the end, the kids have these revelations ON THEIR OWN through impactful life experiences.  Yes, the ""good guys"" win in the end; you want to applaud them along the whole way.  It's like Jane Austen for kids.  My six year old has watched it over 20 times, and is transfixed.  The pace is not super fast, which is another bonus for me.  I don't feel like I am in stimulation overload after watching it.  The sound track is really good; Meghan Trainor's songs are great and not tedious for adults to listen along.  I hope they have a followup, this was an awesome show.",1458604800,,1101,4.374384236453202

7503898,5,B017E5806O,"This is a must-have for all Peanuts fans. It blends vignettes from the TV specials and the comic strip with new dialogue. The two main subplots are Snoopy's continuing battle with the Red Baron and his efforts to save his love, Fifi; and Charlie Brown's pursuit of the Little Red-Haired Girl, who we finally see early in the movie (she was not drawn in the comic strip). Charlie finally meets the red-haired girl face-to-face towards the end of the film.

I was delighted that Vince Guaraldi's original music was generously used in the film. The contemporary music, such as Meghan Trainor's ""Better When I'm Dancin',"" is catchy, but unspectacular. BTW, Meghan, the word ""music"" is pronounced ""mew-sic,"" not ""moo-sic.""

Extras including English, French, and Spanish subtitles; English 5.1 audio, English descriptive audio with a female narrator, French and Spanish 2.0 audio, along with several bonuses, including ""How to Draw"" segments for Snoopy. Woodstock, and Charlie Brown, with director Steve Martino; several Snoopy segments; ""Snoopy's Playlist,"" which repeats the musical segments of the film; a ""Get Down With Snoopy And Woodstock"" music video; three Meghan Trainor ""moo-sic"" videos, one set to ""Better When I'm Dancin',"" featuring animation from the film with the song's lyrics, the regular ""Better When I'm Dancin'"" video with Meghan herself, and a making-of video; four photo galleries; five trailers; and promos for other films.

7503903,5,B017E5806O,"I rented this movie with some reluctance; I was anticipating a dreadful re-imagining of Charles Schulz's iconic characters. After watching it, I rented it twice more and then bought it. Good grief! What a joyful, loving update of a beloved property that, sadly, ended with a whimper with Charles' Schulz's aging and death. Let's face it - the last years of the ""Peanuts"" comic strip were not good years. The strip went on much longer than it should have. Schulz's creative well had clearly run dry, and the strip became so painful to read that I gave up on it. The ""Peanuts"" movies and specials had the same afflictions. The characters that once had so much heart and soul seemed empty cliches. Clearly, the creative spark - or rather, the creative ""Sparky"" (Charles' Schulz's nickname) had faltered and died.

But what a happy miracle this movie turned out to be! Not only did the CGI animation - styled especially for the characters, with a tasteful and childlike simplicity, work magnificently, not only are the characters fully realized and revived - they're better than they've ever been. Take Snoopy (and at one time I would have ended that comment with ""Please!"") He devolved from my favorite ""Peanuts"" character to my least favorite as the strip and specials went on. One of Schulz's few errors was cutting his cartoon pooch off from the rest of the characters - having him live entirely in his own fantasy world with only that dratted bird for company, and not even able to remember his owner's name. Obviously, this was supposed to be funny, but it always left me cold. But in this film, Schulz's son and grandson apparently saw the problem - and fixed it with magnificent results. This Snoopy is a lovable, caring, compassionate pooch that is very much part of the gang, and most satisfyingly, Charlie Brown's best friend. And he is a much better character as a result. And speaking of friends - the movie makes it clear that Charlie actually has lots of them; it doesn't use the ""everybody hates me"" motif that pretty much made up the Charlie Brown narrative in the comic strip. That was fine, because it established Charlie's personality and the root of his legendary angst. But the movie doesn't dwell on that. It doesn't have to in order to portray Charlie's personality. In the movie, Charlie has friends, but that doesn't change who he is; he's still Charlie Brown: a well-meaning, determined but seemingly-doomed dreamer who fails at life simply because he's always at the mercy of Murphy's Law. And even when he fails, his playmates still have his back when it counts, even Lucy - even she celebrates when he finally wins his heart's desire. (And it's always been kind of interesting to me why Charlie Brown cares so much about what Lucy thinks of him. Probably because she's a straight shooter and an honest friend, even if she does keep pulling that frickin' football away).

And imagine - a family-friendly movie that has NO fart jokes, NO booger jokes, no jokes whatsoever dealing with bodily functions. This film relies on personality, slapstick, wit and pathos to entertain. And it does so magnificently. I especially enjoyed the way Charlie Brown daydreams - he does so in 2D animation that looks EXACTLY like Charles Schulz's art and is graceful, vibrant and very funny. Really, I can't recommend this movie too highly. I think it's right up there with Pixar's ""Inside Out"", and I actually kind of hope it wins the Oscar instead. I'd really really like to see Charlie Brown win this one. He deserves it. Good old Charlie Brown!",1458432000,,3554,4.786644951140065

7503914,5,B017E5806O,"""The Peanuts Movie"" is very cute - and exiting! like the fact that they made this movie a mixture of some things that they made up and actual comic strips written by Charles Monroe Schulz. I felt so happy for Charlie Brown when his dream to befriend the little red-haired girl came true, that I actually cried. I was astounded when Snoopy FINALLY, after years of trying and failure, (with a little help from his friend Woodstock the bird and his friends) shot down the Red Baron. It was very funny at the end how Snoopy, Woodstock and his friends, AND Snoopy's new girlfriend, Fifi, all had root beers to celebrate Fifi's rescue (because she had been kidnapped by the Red Baron) and the Red Baron being shot down for good. But the most funniest part of the whole movie is when the Red Baron returns by surprise and Snoopy just can't help but yell what he always yells when he loses to this evil pilot: CURSE YOU RED BARON!

I laughed out loud more than once, and my children, who never really read the comics, thought it was great too.

7504036,4,B017E5806O,"The Peanuts Movie offers a colorful gateway into the world of its classic characters and a sweetly nostalgic.  It is great to see your kids like something you grew up on.  Here is a brief synopsis:

Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus and the rest of the beloved ""Peanuts"" gang make their big-screen debut, like they've never been seen before, in state of the art 3D animation. Charlie Brown, the world's most beloved underdog, embarks upon an epic and heroic quest, while his best pal, the lovable beagle Snoopy, takes to the skies to pursue his arch-nemesis, the Red Baron",1458000000,,573,4.767676767676767

This may Not be for purists of the original style of graphics but it is truly not to be missed by true Peanuts/Snoopy fans.

This baby-boomer allowed herself to have her viewing sense broadened. I was able to appreciate and embrace the new style of the movie. The original style of years past is what brought us in and carried us through for 50 years.

Back in the early 50s, my grandfather taught me to read, before I went to kindergarten, by reading the Peanuts strip.

7504044,4,B017E5806O,"Charles Schulz's lovable creation Peanuts has been around for some time. Growing up in the 80's the tv specials were always a big event and in the summer I would get excited when cable would run the Movie like ""bon boyage charlie brown"" or ""race for your life"". There was even a saturday morning cartoon for a few season I would watch. As time marched on and with Schulz passing Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and all the other peanuts quietly receded into the background of life. The rise of CG animation, social media and the internet itself seemed to date these characters to a simpler time. Now, Blue Sky Studios has attempted to update the peanuts gang for a new generation.

The film itself is a treat to watch. Director Steve Martino was very careful with the source material. It would be tempting to give the characters cell phones and speak using modern slang however the film preserves the simple world that the peanuts gang inhabits. Visually the film opts for CG rather than hand drawn animation however even here there is a an asthetic used to created something unqiue and visually appeally that honors the original art but updates it for new viewers. Through the film Charlie Brown has sveeral thoughts visuallized in the classic peanuts animation style which I Actually preferred however I'm not the target audience of this film.

Overall This is a cute film that works it's hardest to include most of the Peanuts recurring bits (the red baron, kite eating tree, psychiatrist booth, etc) and all the peanuts gang. I was really happy to see that the film didn't neglect or overlook any of the characters and actually gave decent time to all the characters. The film didn't break new ground or really add to the ongoing story of Peanuts but instead shows Charlie Brown fall in love as we cheer him on to meet the little red haired girl.

Overall I found the film cute and was happy that the film stayed true to Schulz's vision of characters who had values. Recommended!",1457913600,,1974,4.68299711815562

7504075,5,B017E5806O,"When I first heard Hollywood was making a Peanuts film my first reaction was a groan followed by an eye roll. ""Oh joy"" I thought. Another of my childhood favorites ruined by an uncaring, incompetent Hollywood. I expected an absolute disaster.

Then I saw the first trailer and fell in love with the art direction. Then the film came out and it got great reviews but my bull headed determination to hate the film prevailed so I never saw it.

Now that it's out on video my curiosity got the better of me so I bought it. And now I could kick myself for not seeing it on the big screen.

The Great Pumpkin is sacred in my home and I proudly put this film right next to it. Yes, it's that good. I really expected the film makers to give us some throw away movie with pop culture references, annoying music and a garbage story. They gave us just the opposite. A beautiful but simple story filled with all the little life lessons of the comics. I think it's magic how they managed to get, not just the feel but every little nuance to come through on film. From Charlie and the whole crew to Snoopy's interactions with Woodstock. Everything was perfect.

The score was my biggest concern but I was wrong about that also. Classic tunes mixed with classical music was the best choice they could have made. Anything less would have cheapened the film. Granted there is a pop song in the middle of the film that I didn't care for but it was only one song. No biggie.

And lastly the art direction. Just, jaw dropping beautiful. I found myself pausing the film frequently just to admire certain scenes. They took the simplicity of the comic and put just the right amount of modern on it to amazing effect.

All in all this film is strong enough to stand with the classic material. As bad as this could have been and by all means should have been...it wasn't. Just the opposite. Brilliant in every way.
This film got a middle aged man to dream. With this art direction and animation could we get a sequel to The Great Pumpkin? Do I dare dream that big? My mouth is watering thinking of the visual feast a Halloween themed film would be. I really look forward to what they come up with next as long as the quality is kept this high.

A beautiful story, classical soundtrack with classic songs also and out of this world animation make The Peanuts film a classic I'll come back to again and again for years to come.",1457827200,,2400,4.367713004484305

Translating Linus's hair to the 3D world was not working and Pig Pen's dust cloud was way too dense compared to how it was portrayed in the originals.  I watched this movie for the first time on DVD and I found myself fast forwarding the movie to all the Snoopy arial dogfight sequences.  I guess those scenes were always my favorite in the original TV special cartoons of Charlie Brown.  I liked Snoopy's aviation adventures in the newspaper comics as well.

We love them.  We were worried about the new movie, hoping that they would maintain the characters as we knew and loved them.  When we saw the movie, we were delighted to be reunited with our old friends again.  Only this time, they were in brighter colors.  It was so fun to watch them take shape with the new technology.  It is a sweet story that stays true to the Peanuts way.  Poor Charlie Brown always facing obstacles, and yet, somehow in the end, things work out.

This movie featured great music that fit with the story and had an upbeat story line while staying true to what made Charlie Brown such a great comic strip.

Lucy still pulls the football away and sends Charlie Brown flying, and Charlie Brown still gets his kite stuck in trees, so we get the point that life has moments of disappointment, but it doesn't overpower the upbeat moments. It all works with a Peanuts feel but without making Charlie Brown into a loser. His friends are also nicer than in the strip and older movies and tv specials.",1457222400,,572,4.617647058823529

Good: family friendly, has a good message to get Charlie Brown moving out of the self-perception that he is a loser, that the choices he makes of kindness and self-sacrifice for his sister and friends make him a winner and good person-nice message!
Bad: The writers focused too much on constantly throwing in bits from the comic strips and old 1/2 hour specials.  The story is not original at all and moves too slowly.  The idea of tying in the world many of us grew up with was good, but overdone-weighing down the flow and overall story.  Wish we had rented, but was swayed by the overwhelming positive reviews.

The animation is beautiful, and true to the old comic strip and tv specials.  I love, love, loved the 3d animation!!  They did a great job voice-casting in this film, too.  All of your favorite Peanut's Gang characters sound just like the original characters sound!

Two of the writers are Charles Schultz's son and his grandson!  This may be why it was so true to what Schultz would have had it be.  Pure.

But, I fell asleep during the movie, kind of boring and soothed me right to sleep.
So, we bought it since my son wanted to watch it again and I hadn't really seen the whole thing.
And, I fell asleep watching this again.

Too much Red Baron.  Story line a little too predictable, but still... true to Charlie Brown!

7504485,5,B017E5806O,"I have to admit that I did not want this movie to happen and was very skeptical about seeing it.  To me, the Peanuts gang was meant to exist in 2D in Charles Schulz' somewhat loose line drawing style and nothing more. I grew up watching the classic animated holiday specials and ""Bon Voyage,  Charlie Brown"" and I saw this as a shameless Hollywood cash grab and a cheapening of a classic.

But then, my wife and I took my 4-year old to see it at the theatre, in 3D, and I'm happy to say that I was totally wrong.

Yes, it is in 3D and yes, the characters are rendered in a more three-dimensional way, with shading and depth but surprisingly, that didn't bother me.  Still the line quality was there and the design was very true to Schulz's vision.  Remarkably, they were able to update the look to appeal to a new generation while retaining the personality and charm of the original.

Visually, the film walks such a fine line between honoring the source material and making it more visually appealing to younger audiences that I was amazed at how great a job they did.  The 3D in the theatre was stunning and you felt like you could reach out and touch the characters, while at the same time they still looked like they had stepped right of the page of the Sunday newspaper.

Another pleasant surprise was that they actually decided to let Charlie Brown continue to be the sad sack, depressed mess that he is and refrain from turning him into some sort of upbeat moralistic character spewing feel good lines about how to keep your chin up.  Not only that, but they kept much of Vince Guaraldi's timeless original score and kept from updating the clothes, surroundings and general atmosphere.  Unfortunately, they did make the mistake of throwing a new top 40-ish single in (from Meghan Trainor, the genius who brought us ""All About That Bass"") that they loop in occasionally and which made me cringe each time I heard it, but that is forgivable.

There is no time frame mentioned, but the characters are still dressing like they're in the sixties/seventies, Snoopy still has fantasies of being a World War 1 flying ace and thankfully none of our characters are whipping out smartphones or making current pop culture references.  And unlike many of the recent kids' movies out there, there is not a single fart joke anywhere.

Kind of like the new Star Wars film, the plot is more content to rehash familiar Peanuts themes and storylines than to chart new territory, but it hits all the right notes and provides enough story to entertain young kids unfamiliar with the source material, while providing some great moments of nostalgia for the parents who grew up with and adore these characters. At 92 minutes, the running time is short enough to keep from overstaying its welcome yet long enough to feel satisfying.

In short, if you have apprehensions about this like I did, feel free to let them go and you'll have a blast with this.",1455408000,3,2935,4.606525911708253

It's a lovely story, one new to fans but everything else is as familiar as an old baseball glove.  And lots/tons of Easter Eggs if you were ever a fan and remember characters like Spike.

7504499,3,B017E5806O,"One of the great charms of the classic Peanuts TV specials was the simple style of the artwork - flat colors, simple line drawings, such a consistent look that I stopped really seeing it after a while and just got into the story. This time, they got textured hair on most characters -but not on Charlie himself. Yes, that's that curly forelock drawn as a pen-squiggle, but bald as a bowling ball beyond that. Set among other characters with more realistic hair, I wondered whether poor Mr. Brown had been through chemotherapy. Likewise Snoopy's textured skin with pen-squiggle facial features - just not a match. The black lines crawling around his textured face seemed to have independent lives of their own, barely related (if at all) to the poor pup.

Then, as others have noted, Charlie Brown came across more as a pitiable schnook than as the latent hero, and - well lots more, but let's skip the unpleasantness. The classic TV specials are as good as they ever were, but, to my eye, this tries a new direction and ends up a bit lost.

If you're looking for filmmakers to do something innovative with these characters, look elsewhere.  Theres probably some fanfic floating around on the internet.  This film is cinematic comfort food and an antidote for those who are tired of the fact that every family film these days seems to consist of an avalanche of poop jokes and double entendre that is intended to go over the heads of the kids.

7504502,5,B017E5806O,"It is very rare that I go out to see a real live movie in a real live movie theater. I cannot bear the strangers sitting beside me, and I dread anyone taller than 3'11"" sitting in front of me because I was born with a minor birth defect that prevents me from seeing through peoples' skulls. Furthermore it is a small torture to me any of the unreasonable sounds my random movie neighbors are inclined to make, like breathing, or smiling. But I live mere blocks from a beautiful, old style, art decoish single screen theater on a grand scale, showing discount, almost ready to come out on DVD movies. So sometimes I am overcome with an impatience to see a movie and my wife and I go, despite the difficulties involved.

And that is how we found ourselves at a Saturday afternoon showing of The Peanuts Movie.

Curiously The Peanuts Movie was everything I heard the new Star Wars movie was; a piece of homage fan fiction, updated, but as much as possible in the spirit and tradition of the source material. And when I say source material I mean the heyday stuff. While Schulz did not savage and mismanage his own creation like George Lucas did his, there is no doubt that the latter years, focusing an awful lot on Snoopy's brother Spike, in the desert, with a cactus, did not have the richness of the strips that were consistently brilliant in the sixties and seventies.

But first, let me say that the filmmakers here did something very clever. They showed a new modern cartoon short film featuring some kind of not cute squirrel creature with an acorn, that was so restless, and humorless, and desperate, that every shred of peacefulness in the Peanuts feature, when it finally came, was double the relief. At least I think that was the filmmakers clever intention. I can't figure out any other reason for it.

And let me also say that I was surprised to find that people still go to the movies despite the fact that one can view the entire history of cinema at one's leisure in one's own home on a large, high resolution screen. There is something sort of sweet and old fashioned about that. The theater, which is a large one, was very full, and my wife and I were nearly the only ones there without kids. During the only weak parts of The Peanuts Movie (some extended sequences with Snoopy pursuing the Red Baron) I looked around the audience and found it bobbing like a mosh pit at a 1990 grunge concert.

So I kind of loved the movie. But it did have a few minor drawbacks as well. The Charlie Brown main story particularly spoke to me. All my life I have publicly been most like Snoopy. I have wished I was most like Linus or even Schroeder. But watching Charlie Brown this time, well, suddenly it all came clear: Charlie Brown, c'est moi!

What I loved:

1. A mostly low key core traditional story retelling (Charlie Brown and the little red haired girl) with all the traditional characters in their most traditional settings (school, home, skating rink, neighborhood, parks).

2. Uses many of the old gags, but usually in fresh, natural, plot relevant ways (Peppermint Patty sleeping in school, Linus philosophizing advice with Charlie Brown, Snoopy's writing ambitions, Lucy working as a horrible Psychiatrist).

3. Includes many updates, jokes, and mild modernizations that were in the spirit of the original. Charlie brown choosing a shirt is an excellent gag along these lines. Sally cashing in on her brother's celebrity was charming, modern, self referential, and consistent. The kids use old style phones with cords, but there was curbside recycling in the neighborhood.

4. The voice work seemed more naturalistic and true to life than the old shows and was the better for it.

What I liked:

1. Computer animation that still captured the feel and prettiness of The Peanuts, albeit with a small loss of expressionism. The small touches of hand drawing were a sweet homage to the source material as well.

The few smaller problems:

1. The red baron sequences go on too long, and are too action heavy in the direction of what ruins every Pixar movie (that is, a 40 minute chase sequence). Fortunately, in this movie it's probably only 5 or 10 minutes too much of this, but if they dared to slow the pace on this movie just a smidgen more it would have been much the better for it. Also, this series of Red Baron vignettes feature a poodle named Fifi (think Fonzie's girlfriend Pinky Tuscadero). Never an original comic strip character, Fifi made me wistful for Snoopy's pursuit of Marcie as a French barmaid and the interconnection of fantasy and neighborhood reality that it brought with it (we get a small reference to this at the end).

2. While the settings are pretty and Twin Cities-ish (important to me as it's where I live and is the source for the strips!), I think the neighborhood skews more towards an idyllic suburb than to a city neighborhood, losing some of the particular charm of the original strip's semi urban setting.

And that is my Peanuts Movie review. Best animated kid movie of 2015, that I saw, I mean, out of the two that I did see. Four out of five stars, but I'm giving it officially five stars because of grading inflation, in an unethical attempt to improve its relative Amazon score average up towards what I think it should be, and out of a slight fit of pique that it wasn't nominated for an academy award.",1452556800,3,5355,4.615141955835962

7504504,5,B017E5806O,"My family watched the peanuts movie and I have to say that Charlie Brown and the gang are the most lovable children and I especially love snoopy and Woodstock. This movie was really good about charlie falling in love with the girl next door. What was so clever was how she got to know charlie which you will see in the movie.

What I love about this movie is that these kids are funny and Charlie teaches the world that life is about taking chances and that life is too short to be sad and depressed. To be happy and learn that there isn't any wrong with being misunderstood . Sometimes being misunderstood is the reason why the girl next door loved Charlie.

I hope that they make another peanuts movies . it was really great movie with laughs and smiles and with an important message that tells us a few things like

Mans best friend will always be by ur side

There is nothing wrong with being misunderstood.

The most important lesson of all is don't be nervous when ringing the girl nexts door house you never know what the reaction will be.

7504507,5,B017E5806O,"This really is a fun movie to watch.  I have never been a huge Peanuts fan, but I always read the comics strips every Sunday and enjoyed watching the holiday specials.  From my point of view this movie is a fantastic adaptation of the source material.  It has all of the iconic moments that just make people think Peanuts, I hope they don't make a sequel, cause if they do it will be nothing but a rehash of everything that's in this movie.  In here we get Snoopy and the red baron, Lucy and the football, Charlie Brown and baseball, along with everything everybody loves about Peanuts.
The main plot of the film is about Charlie Brown trying to win the affections of the little red haired girl, he kind of succeeds, but since he's Charlie Brown he kind of doesn't.  He gets into lots of trouble during this journey and there are a lot of moments both kids and adults will laugh at.
The Red Baron scenes I think would be my favorite part, I always liked those strips most of all, and yes they comprise a big chunk of the film, but it they were done very well and injected the film with some action and a little love story for Snoopy which I liked a lot.  There are a couple short mid credits scenes so stick around for those.  Overall I think this movie is true to the source material and will please hard core fans and casual readers alike.",1451606400,,1341,4.276679841897233

7504510,5,B017E5806O,"This movie is beyond charming and very cute. It really does do a great job at representing the comic strips. I also love the fact they didn't update it. The animation is GORGEOUS and the characters are GREAT! The voice actors are spot on, and Snoopy's little 'adventures' are so cute.

I love how they kept so many references, such as the Kite eating tree, the chewed up pencil, and even during the credits we get to see Snoopy's siblings having a Root beer party.

This movie is charming, funny and completely worth buying. It is a must have for all true Peanuts fans, and it will NOT disappoint! The loyalty it has to the comic is incredible",1450396800,58,643,4.440677966101695

I couldn't stop laughing on how comedic this movie was, and how well animated the classic Peanuts were designed by the Blue Sky Studios & 20th Century Fox. All in all, I'm a huge fan of Blue Sky movies. My most favorite being the Rio movies. I'm anxiously waiting for the 3rd, which should be in a few more years (2017). But anyways, go watch the Peanuts Movie if you haven't seen it. Its a very funny family movie.

I've seen this movie four times already, and each time was non stop hilarity from your favorite Peanuts pals!",1450137600,17,704,4.138686131386861
7504512,2,B017E5806O,"As one who grew up looking forward to prime time Charlie Brown television specials to commemorate special days such as Halloween and Christmas, I have always had a place in my heart for Charlie Browns sincerity and earnestness as he conveys a heartwarming message that all children should be required to learn: that there are times that you feel that everything you do is wrong and that no one likes you, but later you just might find that weren't nearly as bad as you thought.

Who can forget the Charlie Brown Christmas Special, where are Charlie Brown, originally disparaged and laughed at for buying a sick looking Christmas tree only to learn, through Linus wisdom, that he was the only one to really understand the true meaning of Christmas?  Or A Boy Named Charlie Brown, where after spelling dozens of complicated and obscure words, Charlie Brown stumbled on the word beagle, to find himself the universal laughing stock until his best friend Linus points out a simple observation to him that enables him to re-enter humanity: that the world did not end. It was through the Peanuts of old that most of us could see Charlie Brown in ourselves, surrounded by the Lucys and Violets of the world, all of whom seem to dislike us for no apparent reason. Then on top of that was the spoiled and irreverent dog Snoopy, who laughs hardest at every Charlie Brown mishap while never seeming to find a different owner.

It is from this standpoint that I found the Peanuts movie so disappointing. Charlie Brown was no longer the earnest outcast, whose profound thoughts showed a greater understanding than his peers. He had become the clumsy idiot. From the opening scene, when he is flying a kite in the dead of winter while everyone else is ice skating, to his hapless attempts to meet the red haired girl, a new student in his class, I found myself less identifying with him and more cringing at his ineptitude. Then, the relationship with his dog had changed. No longer did Snoopy find humor in Charlie Browns misery. He was now the ultimately faithful companion with a warm and loving relationship, which though nice lacked the bite and humor that it did in the past.

Furthermore, the relationship with the nameless red haired girl seemed dated. From the day the girl first joined Charlie Browns school, Charlie Brown had a debilitating crush on her despite their never having spoken and his knowing virtually nothing about her other than what she looks like. There was a time when all a girl was expected to do to make a boys acquaintance was to look pretty and hope he talks to her, and a boy was not expected to like her for anything other than her looks. In today's society, where girls are playing sports and aspiring toward professions at the same if not greater rate than boys, such relationships are often perceived as demeaning by girls and inadequate by boys. In fact, Charlie Brown could well be perceived as a stalker.

Finally, half the movie was taken up by Snoopys imaginary flight battles. Yes, in the TV shows they were cute, but to take up half the time in a full-length feature, adding nothing to the overall plot, felt like just a waste of time.

I still enjoy reading the old comic strips and watching the occasional television special. Unfortunately, this movie did not do it for me, my kids were indifferent, and my wife fell asleep during it--and she loves childrens animation.",1450051200,22,3402,4.709243697478992
7504513,4,B017E5806O,"Yup. It's the old gang, ready for a trip down Memory Lane in this G-rated romp which celebrates the classic personalities we love...although for the little 'uns, it goes on a bit too long and the 3D i$ a wa$te! Remember, the story is the thing and in this one we have two stories running side by side: Charlie Brown's latest dilemma and Snoopy's air battles with the Red Baron.

This is capably directed by Steve Martino (""Ice Age: Continental Drift"") with a script written by Charles Schulz's grandson Bryan and produced by Bryan's father Craig. Three Schulz generations have been involved in Charlie Brown's life. What a legacy!

The cast:
  * Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp) is, once again, an underdog. That kite will NOT stay up and that new red-haired girl in his class has him tongue-tied. The book ""How to Be a Winner"" is his only hope. ""Good Grief!""
  * Snoopy (Bill Melendez) is an underdog's dog, but he never stops trying. ""Curse you, Red Baron!""
  * Lucy van Pelt (Hadley Belle Miller) is exasperated by Charlie's incompetence but even more upset when it looks like he might succeed. ""You blockhead!"" And don't forget her unrequited passion for Schroeder.
  * Sally (Mariel Sheets) is an upbeat and admiring little sister, but the stars in her eyes are for Linus.
  * Schroeder (Noah Johnston) even plays the 20th Century Fox theme as the movie opens! Lucy just won't leave him alone.
  * Little Red-Haired Girl (Francesca Capaldi) Just her presence reduces Charlie Brown to a red-faced mute. Watch him try to ring the doorbell at her house.
  * Peppermint Patty (Venus Schultheis) is the smartest one in the class ...and she knows it!
  * Marcie (Rebecca Bloom) is Peppermint Patty's faithful retainer. ""Wake up, Sir!""

We can't forget Linus and Pig-Pen, either. As always, the central issue is acceptance and success, but the heart and soul of these characters rests on the shoulders of the brilliant animators, who remind us why we love these guys.

I saw reminders from my own childhood: a tooth-marked pencil, playing crack the whip, learning to dance, pinching fingers in three-ring binder, and overwhelming feelings of inadequacy. This movie puts Charlie Brown in the middle of a moral dilemma where it would be much easier to allow a lie than to tell the truth.

The adults, as you may recall, are represented by the ""Wah-Wah"" machine and the other voices are excellent.",1450051200,7,2388,4.803921568627451

7504515,5,B017E5806O,"All the peanuts gang are played by young children and there is no adults in all of the peanut tv shows and films. It is highly fascinating by all ages a like. I believe there is two plot lines going on at once. Charlie Brown figuring out the new kid in town. As the story goes along he slowly gains more and more information about her. Then she all of sudden wants to be Charlie Browns partner in school. He waits for the right moment to ask her why she wants to be his partner. He waits for the right moment because partly he likes this new girl. She wants to be his partner because he's honest in his school. She remembered that he explained a test wasn't his. Meanwhile with this going on, Snoopy has his own adventures going on with him versus the red baron, and his date beagle girl. I hope they make another peanuts movie because the beagle girl and snoopy can make a whole movie itself. I mean, we never have seen snoopy crush on a beagle girl so for peanuts fans we find this interesting and want to see more. All in all, it was a good story, I highly recommend to all ages. I am an adult and this movie had me laughing. Since snoopy couldn't go to school with Charlie Brown, he was at the type writer writing imaginary red baron stories. Snoopy and his flying googles was the cutest thing out of this entire movie. I really enjoyed how they brought that scene further out in the movie. I encourage you to go see it with your entire family and friends.",1449878400,18,1460,4.2178571428571425
