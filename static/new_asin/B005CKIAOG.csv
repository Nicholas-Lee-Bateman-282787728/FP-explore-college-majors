8465564,4,B005CKIAOG,"The President Goes To Heaven would be a long forgotten low budget film, if not for a strange twist of events; one of the stars of the film ran for Congress, resulting in MSNBC Anchor Rachel Maddow discovering and sharing with the world this crazy piece of cinema.

Watching the film, it's a crazy ride which sadly peters out towards the end with regards to it's non-ending. Fans of bad movies or people who don't like Republicans/George W Bush will probably get a kick out of the film, which plays as one huge revenge fantasy. A George W Bush stand-in goes into a coma and gets abused by the hospital staff, his family, and the rest of the world; all of which is celebrating his bad health.

The film goes off onto so many different crazy side tangents, it's hard to not laugh at it. In particular, the film goes on side rants about the morality of raping brain dead beauty queens (who die giving birth to rape babies), white men being cucked by their trophy wives, 9/11 conspiracy theories that blame the government for the attacks, government framing and murdering innocent people to cover up it's crimes, organ trafficking and the murder of third world country citizens to supply organs for the rich... The film makers were probably earnest making it, but the film plays like an Ed Wood film on steroids in a good way.

Sadly, the film falls apart at the end like most bad movies do. There is no real conclusion; the plot just stops and ends with a contrived musical number disassociated from the main plot.",1505520000,,1510,4.564575645756458
