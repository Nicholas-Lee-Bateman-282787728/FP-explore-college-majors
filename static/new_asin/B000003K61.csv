7903109,4,B000003K61,"Good points:  The main plot, which is that the Enterprise needs to move the colonists from Dorvan 5 before the Cardassians take over (thanks to a treaty, Dorvan 5 is in Cardassian territory and all the colonists need to be moved, who happen to be Native Americans.  And they are getting tired of being forcebly removed from their lands).  Also, the Traveler coming back is cool.  Plus, this is the final episode that has Wesley in it.  I also like the way they resolve the whole crisis in the end.

Bad Points:  Wesley attitude problem and that the Traveler seems to say to this, ""That's okay, you just aren't respecting yourself enough"".  Pardon?  Wesley has plenty of respect for HIMSELF; it's OTHERS he has a problem showing respect.  You also have to criticize his rash behavior with the colonists by nearly starting a riot and putting Worf and others in jeopardy.  He then doesn't apologize for this behavior later, stating only that what the Enterprise is doing is wrong.  Side note:  Star Trek tends to act as if God doesn't exist or is irrelavent.  If there's no absolute standard (think Prime Directive here), then how can Wesley say that this is wrong (in fact, this applies to any episode when dealing with morals)?  I'm not saying it isn't wrong, I'm just pointing out the problem with giving an absolute and saying there isn't one at the same time.  Also, Admiral Nechayev.  Yes, she has a minor role, yes, admirals are typically in a sort of ""I'm so important and you are to do my bidding"" mentality, but this one is a perfectionist at doing that.  I know someone who says she's a twerp, but you have to admit this, Capt. Picard and Riker don't like her either, but they try to be nice to her.

Overall:  While I appreciate the main story, the sub-plot (which is heavily intertwined) really does some damage to the overall episode.  There's a good scene though with Dr. Crusher and Wesley and her saying that she loves Wesley no matter what!  That does bring the level to 4 stars, but otherwise a three.  It is interesting to watch and it would be great for discussion groups about the different arguments and values in the episode.",1157414400,,2146,4.589473684210526
7903110,4,B000003K61,"While Picard is forced to relocate a group of North American Indians from a planet they have settled, one of the colonists causes Wesley to re-examine his future.
Admiral Nechayev informs Picard that a settlement between the Cardassians and the Federation has created new borders between the two powers, placing some Federation colonies in what is now Cardassian territory. Picard is given the assignment of evacuating one of those planets, a 20-year-old enclave of North American Indians located on Dorvan Five. He reminds her that the American Indians were once unjustly forced off their land seven centuries before, but Nechayev stands firm, ordering Picard to remove the settlers by any means necessary.
Picard and Troi meet with the members of Dorvan Five's tribal council, who express their unwillingness to leave. Meanwhile, Wesley Crusher, who is taking a break from Starfleet Academy, confuses everyone with his strangely mad attitude. A villager named Lakanta, recognizes Wesley, and approaches him saying that he has been waiting for him for two years, and can help Wesley find the answers his troubled spirit seeks.
Wesley goes to the Indian village, but is confused when no clear path presents itself. He talks with Lakanta about his puzzlement. Meanwhile, Picard meets again with the council, and is informed that the group has no intention of leaving. Picard sadly says that he has no choice but to remove them, but one of the leaders, Anthwara, says he does not believe Picard will do this, and reveals that one of Picard's ancestors was involved in a brutal massacre of Indians seven hundred years before. Anthwara states that Picard was somehow chosen to right this wrong. Surprised by this revelation, Picard leaves the meeting, then discovers that three Cardassians have landed on Dorvan Five.
Picard asks the trio's leader, Gul Evek, to leave, reminding him that the Indians have six weeks left to evacuate. Evek, however, is anxious to begin surveying the planet and refuses. Picard reluctantly orders Worf to prepare an evacuation. Meanwhile, Lakanta takes Wesley to the Habak "" a traditional ceremonial chamber where he begins his spiritual odyssey. Soon, he finds himself face-to-face with his father, who says Wesley has reached the end of a journey which started after the elder Crusher's death, and must now find his own path. His experience over, Wesley wanders back into the village and finds Worf preparing to remove the Indians by transporter. Deeply affected, Wesley suddenly takes the side of the North American Indians.
Furious, Picard confronts Wesley about his behavior, but Wesley, simply resigns from Starfleet. While packing to leave, he tells Beverly about his vision, realizing his father was telling him not to follow in his Starfleet footsteps. Beverly understands and reminds him about the Traveler, a mysterious alien being that once said her son was destined for something different. Wesley returns to the standoff on Dorvan Five, where Lakanta reveals himself to be the Traveler. With the Traveler, Wesley has begun a new journey, which will take him to other planes of existence. Meanwhile, Picard is able to convince Evek to avoid another war with the Federation by allowing the Indians to maintain their colony under Cardassian jurisdiction. The U.S.S. Enterprise then departs, leaving behind Wesley, who will study with the Indians as the next step in his journey.",1059004800,,3416,5.190217391304348
7903111,2,B000003K61,"Sheesh... I guess it wasn't bad enough that Wussley- whoops, Wesley Crusher brought the NextGen show down a bit when he was a regular, now we discover he's gifted with the ability to shift himself to other dimensions! The Traveler, a being who's alluded to Wesley's burgeoning abilities in two previous eppies, returns here to help him along his path to discovering new realities without requiring a vehicle (as well as making a lotta NextGen trekkies hate his guts). Too bad he didn't show the kid how to shift himself to sci-fi limbo and strand him there forever! But, at least Wes resigned his commission as a cadet, so there is a bit of an upside to this whole sad affair (thus two stars instead of one)...

7903112,5,B000003K61,to me this episode is so good because it shows the plight of the american indians continuing on into the futrue. transplanted so many times they now end up on another planet ! this episode awakens your conscience and makes you remember how bad the human race can really be.,991267200,2,273,4.48
7903113,4,B000003K61,"Wesley Crusher is on board the Enterprise during a break from Starfleet Academy as the ship heads for Dorvan Five.  This particular planet is going to be turned over to the Cardassians as part of the negotiated peace treaty.  The Enterprise has been ordered to remove the Federation colonists.  However, these colonists are descended from North American Indians and not only do they not want to leave their new home, they believe that Picard is under some sort of obligation to help them because one of his ancestors crushed a revolt by their ancestors in the 17th Century.  Meanwhile, Wesley, who is walking around in a really bad mood, makes friends with an colonist who insists a vision revealed Wesley would visit Dorvan Five.  In the vision room Wesley experiences a visitation from his father, Jack, who tells the boy he has been following a path that was not his own and the time has come for him to begin his own journey.
From the first episode of STNG, it was obvious Wesley Crusher would grow up to be a great Starfleet Captain.  ""Journey's End"" destroys that future Wesley and replaces it with...well, we are not exactly sure what, but it seems to be one of those next steps in human evolution type deals.  For most of this episode Wesley is the complete bratty kid many viewers accused him of being early on in the series.  What redeems the episode somewhat for me is the appearance of the Traveler (previously seen in ""Where No One Has Gone Before,"" Episode 6 and ""Remember Me,"" Episode 79), although the idea of Wesley being rewarded for his petulant behavior is not exactly a happy thought.  The problems with the colonists on Dorvan Five also seems a bit contrived as a personal crisis for Wesley, Picard or anybody else for that matter.  What is missing is what happened to Wesley in between this episode and his previous appearance to make him want to abandon his boyhood dreams.  Good thing his father set him straight.  In retrospect it is interesting that apparently no one in the Star Trek universe has seen neither hide nor hair of Wesley after he and the Traveler went their merry way.  Certainly no one expected this would be the final fate of Wesley Crusher, so in that regard you have to give ""Journey's End"" some bonus points.",988070400,3,2254,4.647355163727959
7903114,4,B000003K61,"In this episode, Wesley Crusher resigns from the academy. He seems troubled and curt with everyone...not the humble and likeable Wesley we've come to know. However, while Picard struggles to obey his conscience and  avoid a forced relocation of a small group of planet dwellers to satisfy  the treaty with the Cardassians, Wesley finds 'the path' that he's been  heading toward all his life.
I like this episode very much.",964137600,9,422,5.0
