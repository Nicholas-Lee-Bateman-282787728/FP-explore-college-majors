8484959,4,B005SH648M,"I cannot understate how much my son loves this dvd.  Almost too much... we've had to set viewing limits.

There are four skits in the dvd:
Iron Monster (where Grover invents a new superhero for the laundromat while his Super Grover cape is getting cleaned)
The Furry Four (Telly, Elmo, and Abby are on a quest to find a 4th person to play pretend with them)
Super Grover's Sidekick (Grover tries to save the day with the help a sidekick, Horatio the Elephant)
Slimey the Hero (Oscar helps Slimey the Worm be a little hero like Trash Gordon)

The last segment, Slimey the Hero, while a cute concept is the most difficult skit to watch out of all of them.  The ""acting"" is really cringe worthy.  I feel like they could have found a better one to use in its place.  Little kids do not notice such things, though, and the rest are actually entertaining (the first twenty times).  So if you have a Sesame Street lover, don't hesitate--scoop it up!",1474243200,,942,4.473684210526316
