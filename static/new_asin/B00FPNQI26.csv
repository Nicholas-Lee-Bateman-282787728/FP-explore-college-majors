6016632,5,B00FPNQI26,"Def worth checking out for fans of 70's American horror. Awesome soundtrack stands out especially, great performance by Derek Phillips.",1388966400,2,135,5.8
6016633,5,B00FPNQI26,"While the film had a simpler plot, the manner in which the film developed actually took time to build suspense so that the last 30 minutes of the film put you on the edge of your seat. The relationship between Tom and Lovely was very realistic.

The filming technique and dialogue adds a sense of realism to the cult situation. The main characters reactions to the plot twists feel genuine.

Great movie! I highly recommend it to people that love suspense and horror!",1388880000,4,467,4.614457831325301

6016635,1,B00FPNQI26,"Spoilers. THERE IS NO RITUAL IN THE STORY... except in some lame found tape about a previous victim.
This movie jumps around as if it's being witty and tarantino esque, but very poorly wielded.
The dialogue- Bad. But this movie has lots of it as if it were good dialogue.
Horror execution- Terrible.
Characters- you just want the main ones to die so it will be over.
Cinematography- too dark. The main chase takes place in complete darkness, couldn't tell what was happening.
Climax- if this movie had a climax, I must of missed it.",1388793600,2,532,4.610526315789474
6016636,1,B00FPNQI26,"This movie was awful, there was no plot, terrible acting,and the camera work was below par. There story or lack of made no sense whatsoever, very dull very slow waste of time. No thrills, no chills, no excitement. Please do not waste your time or hard earned money on such a terrible film you will certainly be disappointed.

6016638,3,B00FPNQI26,"The acting could have been much better, but there is a very creepy and bloody story going on here, as well as some weird camera work and very effective music.",1388620800,2,158,4.3
6016639,1,B00FPNQI26,"We see Tom (Dean Cates) and Lovely (Lisa Marie Summerscales) meet on a beach that looks like it is the 1950's. It is most likely a California beach because in the end we see the sun setting on it, yet the film takes place in Texas. Somehow this couple got married and separated and we are some time in the future, i.e. car has a digital radio, digital camera, but no one has apparently aged and the motel room has an ancient phone.

Lovely has called Tom from a motel room where a stabbed man lies bleeding on the floor who may or may not be dead. Upon investigation Tom discovers he is part of a cult that does killings and Lovely appears to have been designated as the next victim.

I won't go beyond the film description, but the ending lacked closure and caused confusion. The film had uneven sound. The camera had bad reflection from night time lights and even a green box in a few of the frames. It made it look like Tom was being filmed. Was this deliberate or just part of the low budget? Was the beach really in California or was it supposed to be Texas and they goofed about the sunset? What was the time period? Was there a definite time period or was that to show that the ritual guys haven't changed in 50 years? What was the whole point of the ritual?

I am open for a plot spoiler explanation.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. No nudity. Not much gore/violence.

6016640,1,B00FPNQI26,"One of the most frustrating films I have ever seen, the only saving grace of the whole ordeal is the acting by the female lead. She was convincing, and actually made me care a bit about her fate. The film, however, was so bad, we actually booed when it was over. Such a wasted premise, and the film seemed to have such great potential, so who was responsible for ruining this? They should be ashamed of themselves for messing up what could have been a very entertaining film. Avoid this at all costs!",1388534400,2,500,4.387096774193548
6016641,5,B00FPNQI26,"This is a hidden gem for horror lovers.  Ritual starts in on the action and doesn't let up.  I found myself very tense for the entire running time of this film and was very satisfied  by the end.  For those that are wondering where all the good horror has gone look no further than Mickey Keating's Ritual, this guy is bringing it back.",1435622400,,336,4.285714285714286
6016642,2,B00FPNQI26,"This movie was headed somewhere and then just stopped. The movie deserved a much better ending. The idea was  good. The acting was good. The budget was low, but the movie certainly did not suffer. A good script can more than compensate for a low budget. But building up only to say, 'that's it"" did not make much sense.

I once saw a ""Ten Commandments"" movie that had no water. Imagine a Red Sea that you don't get to see. The entire movie was terrible  with high school special effects, but no water?

This movie had all the right ingredients; the handsome prince, the beautiful damsel in distress, a good build up and then cablunk! I understand the ending, but it just did not work. This movie certainly was not boring. There always has to be a climactic struggle in the end. It also would have helped if we got to see her husband's beaten body in the motel, though Dean Cates' character should have not been killed until near the end trying to or saving his wife. We should have seen more of the process of what the devil worshipers do at the sacrificial ceremonies. There was too much left for us to assume. We did not get to see the two guys capture the main character. That was a big no-no.

In the end, the movie needed and end and a build up to the end. The course was good, but the destination wasn't there.",1426377600,,1316,4.3117408906882595
6016643,1,B00FPNQI26,This was a really boring movie. Never seemed to get anywhere except darkness you couldn't see most of the movie from the picture being so dark and lots and lots of screaming. But never really gets anywhere. It just stops and never really explains very much.,1422662400,,257,4.608695652173913
6016644,3,B00FPNQI26,This is Vacancy but not as good. Vacancy and Vacancy 2 were good little horror movies about people who find video tapes of brutality in a their motel room. That's what Ritual is. Of course the details vary but that's it in a nutshell. Still I love these styles movies and Ritual delivers just not as good as Vacancy. Worth watching,1421884800,,331,4.442622950819672
6016645,4,B00FPNQI26,"I was surprisingly pleased upon viewing this movie last night. It is a tale of two different movies to a certain extent. I love how it took time to develop and morph into what it ended up being. Do not be surprised if it takes you time to figure out what is going on, as the director clearly wanted to develop a bad situation and then throw in some events that create an even worse situation. The acting was not bad and the camera work was solid, if occasionally choppy.

This is worth at least a rental and I think as was said in another review, for an After Dark Original this is a surprisingly solid, well-made and well-acted movie. I would recommend it without any reservation for horror/thriller fans. Particularly if you enjoy movies that start as one thing and then turn into another.",1419379200,2,791,4.455172413793103
6016646,4,B00FPNQI26,"It's an art to know just how much to show in order to scare the Bejeezus out of people. An art strongly displayed here. There are two rituals taking place here: the ritual of death, sacrifice of the innocent, and the broken ritual between Tom and Lovely (played oh so fetchingly by Lisa Marie Summerscales). We see all the brutality of the skull headed death mongers, but we never see behind the masks to their true intentions. Their true intentions are clear, they saturate the creepy gloomy Halloween night on which this takes place. Don't think too much about this one, just enjoy it.",1402531200,2,587,4.653846153846154

Predictable 100% of the time

**spoiler alert - not that it would ruin a movie that is already this bad**

Ending was not a shocker - story was not original - acting mediocre (that's being generous - considering there were only 3 actors in most of the movie and one died in the first 10 mins)

6016649,2,B00FPNQI26,"""WARNING""  AS OF 2/8/14 SEVEN OF THE TEN 5 STAR RATINGS ARE BY FIRST OR ONE TIME REVIEWERS.  The reason I mention this is to alert the possible viewer so they won't be duped by all the possible fraudulent high ratings and will review the other repeat reviewers honest reviews.

On with this movie. It is a Indie film with a limited budget as is the case for most Indie films. It is mainly shot from either a vehicle or a hotel room as the primary backdrops for most of the movie.  We have two primary lead characters who are in a troubled marriage.  The (ex)wife goes out looking for a hookup, love, career or whatever. The wife gets into some serious trouble and calls the husband to extract her from her predicament. They find out that she was targeted for ? This pretty much sums up what gets the pair in trouble with the ??? and is the basic storyline for this movie.

The concept of the story is promising and the acting is decent (the female gets annoying at times) taking into consideration the budget, director, actor experience and so on.

The three things that ruin this movie is the director/writer, lighting and the who's, what's and why's these cultists are and why they do what they do. The director lets many of the scenes run way to long and ruins the tension/mood or suspense of the scene. The very dim lighting or blacked out scenes are used to set the tone or mood, but many scenes are just to dimly lit or blacked out to be effective. The director and writer don't really give us very much info on this cult and will leave you wondering what was the purpose of telling us only part of the story when its the title of the story??? We are never given any payment for watching the movie to its conclusion? By that I mean we never really witness the full intent (other than the obvious) of the Rituals nor do we ever know who these guy's are or why they do what they do ???

The directors take on the fight for life scene with a firearm was terribly executed and looked foolish especially considering the males firearm experience and background that we are specifically informed of .

There is some fairly violent fight scenes with some gore and blood, but not over the top and surprisingly there is a total lack of nudity in this movie. The viewer is exposed to a good amount of cursing including the F word throughout the movie.

Overall I will give this 2 generous stars. Rented from RedBox DVD.",1391817600,,2414,4.380313199105146
6016650,5,B00FPNQI26,"I love satanic cult films. The 70s were the pinnacle of these movies (Racing with the Devil, The Devils Rain, Brotherhood of Satan are some of the better known classics) and I've been known to frequently complain that horror movie makers have forgotten about it. When House of the Devil came out, I was ecstatic. Lords of Salem, though not an exact fit, was also a high for me, tho I don't know why they cut it so much for the DVD/Blu release. So glad I saw it in the theatre. I never expected Ritual to hit the sweet spot. The trailer is not a good representation at all of the film. This is one of the few movies in a long time that had such a naturalistic feel, like I was peeping into someone's life. The actors really brought it. Both Tom and Lovely were very convincing and authentic. The plot kicks off right away (after the retrospective interlude on the beach, which I appreciated;; it gave me a feel for the characters' past that I could contrast with them in the present in a very simple, quick way). I also really appreciated how the backstory, though not a lot is really required for the movie, was organically interspersed in the dialogue. A great example of ""show, don't tell"". The plot kicks off and doesn't let up after that. Since I'm a horror junkie, and got hooked as a child,  its been a lonnng time since any movie ""scared"" me. I am very happy when a movie manages to generate good tension, where I find myself leaning forward, holding my breath at times, and engrossed in the happenings. Ritual succeeded in the tension department. I hope one day before I die, someone will make a movie that  ""scares"" me but till then I am grateful for tension. Usually, the French films are reliable that way. The story is simple and to the point. The technical aspects of the film were good, especially for a low budget feature (compared to many of them on here). The visuals and the audio were well done. I even watched all the way through the credits till it said ""The End"" (there were scenes interspersed throughout the credits- though nothing that changes the movie). I can see the filmmakers love for the genre and enjoyment in the making of it. Given the trend of bashing horror movies, even those which are technically strong, with good budgets, etc. I don't expect that this movie will get the appreciation it deserves, so I am driving the point home here: I loved it!  I hope I don't inflate expectations here, as its best to go in with low to none. Rarely does a movie match my very high expectations, so I try to tone them down. That is even more necessary for low budget, indie, streaming only horror flicks  If you are into Satanic cult flicks, then I can't imagine why you'd be dissatisfied with this one. Perhaps you won't be as thrilled as me but I can't imagine you feeling like it was a waste. On the other hand, if you rarely like a low budget, streaming horror flick, and you don't really get excited about the Devil, then you might not appreciate this one.",1391817600,,2986,4.43351548269581
6016658,3,B00FPNQI26,"Unsatisfying but occasionally striking horror film about a couple who are being pursued by some men in skeleton masks who may be satanists looking to complete a sacrifice--or just wackos who like to kill people while wearing creepy masks and videotaping it.

If you're a certain kind of horror fan then as soon as you see Larry Fessenden's name in the opening credits you have a pretty good idea of what kind of horror movie to expect--brainy, low-budget and not a lot of action (despite the jokey warning that opens the film claiming that the movie contains graphic violence).

Ritual can be pretty talky but once the couple find the video camera and what's recorded the movie manages to generate a fair amount of suspense with a minimum of resources.

Still, Ritual is a bit too low-key for its own good and ultimately feels more like smart people screwing with you than a genuinely effective horror movie.  There's a lot of read in between the lines dialogue with the couple that suggests they have a violent past and may have what happens coming to them but the movie never fills in the blanks.  In fact we find out virtually nothing about either of the lead characters--which makes it hard to care much whether they live or die.

Some people will likely love Ritual, if only because its a movie that assumes the audience is smart and very familiar with horror films.  Others will likely find it slow and boring--but if you do have the patience to sit through Ritual make sure to watch all the way through the end credits.",1390089600,4,1526,4.62962962962963
6016659,4,B00FPNQI26,"Ritual gets four stars--for After Dark fans. Other viewers might give this horror flick a three. However, I watch After Dark Horrorfest offerings and AD Originals faithfully. Ritual is not as good as the stimulating and thought-provoking The Final, Rinne, and Dread. But, it is better than the boring The Abandoned and Nightmare Man. In quality, I would compare Ritual to the recent Dark Circles or The Reeds. It is something to watch that a horrorfan enjoys well enough.
Certainly, the lead actors give strong performances. They are believable and empathetic as two damaged people trying to negotiate very weird circumstances straight out of the film Vacancy. Even in real life, what the hell would a person do if he had sickos on his trail and an existing mess in a motel room to take care of. A viewer gets into them and their story. I agree with other reviewers that actress Lisa Marie Summerscales rises to her role's challenges especially. Besides, the performances, I like Ritual's premise. This movie's horrors could and do really happen. That truth gets under a person's skin.
However, I do think that Ritual could have openly presented more of its horrors. Instead, it mostly suggests them, perhaps for budgetary reasons. I want more horror imagery to go with my horror viewing. Also, Ritual borrows too often from better horror movies. The events imitate Vacancy, V/H/S, and House of the Devil, but Ritual fails to equal or exceed those fine films.
Give Ritual a watch if you wish. Here, it was something to watch with some beer before bedtime. And, I slept well after spending money to rent it.",1389657600,,1606,4.864963503649635
6016660,2,B00FPNQI26,"Cheating wife(Lovely) ends up in a motel room with an abusive guy she picked up at a local bar.  She stabs him(apprently to death) after he trys to rape her, with his own knife.  Lovely panics and calls her estranged husband(Tom)for help.  Tom reluctantly arrives and finds out the guy is involved with a Satanic cult, that intends to make Lovely their next sacrifice.  A horrific chain of events begins as the couple flees, but is drawn back to the motel because of a mishap.  This is low budget and mildly entertaining with a lot of inconsistencies, like time period.  The most effective scenes are in the clauasaphobic motel room.  The thing is, Lovely is not a good person so you really don't care what happens to her.  See ""Vacancy"" and ""Strangers"" for a more satisfying creative horror experience.",1389398400,2,803,4.726618705035971
6016661,1,B00FPNQI26,"While the movie was creepy, this was, or appeared to be anyway, a nickel-dime movie.  The acting of those starring in the film wasn't that great.  You could tell they were acting.  Aside from that, I didn't like the fact that the movie was just too much talk and not enough action, for me anyway, which is why I rate it one star.  This movie could have been way better than what it is had it not been for that.  The weird effects they tried with the cameras got old for me real quick, and just when it started to get good, the movie ended.  It's good for about one watch, and I'd say that's it.

Sometimes you just gotta know that the bush has made its point--whatever it was. In truth, this could have been a riveting plot for a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.
