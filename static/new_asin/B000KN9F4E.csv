8158269,5,B000KN9F4E,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurably powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

During the ordeal with princess Abi, a mysterious archer appears. This person is called Saint Hijiri. Hijiri is aiding those who are under attack from Abi. Inuyasha's group believes that Hijiri may actually be Kikyo.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353456000,2,1362,4.465863453815261

8158271,4,B000KN9F4E,"This is a pretty typical episode of Inuyasha including the never-ending tension between Kikyo and Kagome.

In this episode Kagome is the only one who can save Kikyo and she does so but not without some hurt towards Inuyasha reaction to Kikyo being alive.  Kagome shows great understanding and even Inuyasha has learned to be more sensitive to Kagome's feelings when it comes to Kikyo.

This is a great episode that explores the more intimate workings of Inuyasha and Kagome's developing relationship and problems they face.  Great episode for one who wants to see more of character development.",1173312000,4,594,5.030612244897959
