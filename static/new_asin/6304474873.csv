7872200,5,6304474873,"why isn't this on blue ray dvd or 3d, this is way to good to be available only on VHS. This is a must see documentary",1420588800,,117,3.5384615384615383
7872201,5,6304474873,My favorite video by far.  Having the pleasure of working for a historical heritage hotel in Darjeeling........I will second that India is the most breathtaking place I have ever visited... The DVD depicts a true image of what India is all about....Extremely well done...Jai Ho!!!,1269561600,,280,5.222222222222222
7872202,5,6304474873,"What a tragedy that this has been allowed to all but disappear!  As of this date, Netflix doesn't have it, and (apparently) it has never been transferred to DVD.  Far, far more than a story of the railway (fascinating in itself) this uses the railway as an organizing theme to talk about India.  And the photography is just breathtaking as well.  This is what the print National Geographic did for a generation prior to the video revolution: take us on an intelligent journey to a different world and present it sympathetically.  And then, come back to the railway: they evoke the romance, the congestion, the history, of that as well in a way far superior to most rail videos.",1220486400,,677,4.65546218487395
7872203,5,6304474873,"This movie takes the viewer all across India on board their spectacular train system. We see all this through the film at a stage where India is shifting from using steam locomotives to electric and diesel. National Geographic shows the viewer how emotionally attached people can become to their careers, i.e. the steam locomotive crew.

The viewer will see breathtaking vistas of India and become a little more knowledgeable in the Indian culture.

All in all, this movie was very good, and if one were to be visiting India someday, or has a fascination for locomotives, this is the movie to watch.",1123027200,5,599,4.862745098039215
7872204,5,6304474873,"This video is outstanding in all respects. The script, the naration, the videography, the music and the editing are all superb. One of the best National Geographic documentaries ever created. In just two hours such themes as the history of India, the politics of India, the religion of India, the geography of India, the passing of an era and growing older are skillfully and lyricly woven together with a story line that overtly explores the end of the steam era on the Indian rail system. This video be greatly enjoyed by a much broader audience than merely those steam train buffs among us.",1094860800,2,593,4.766990291262136
7872205,5,6304474873,"One of my all-time favorite National Geographic videos. A journey on an Indian train is not unlike the journey of life itself - but one must be awake to the experience. If you haven't yet been experienced, you need to see this video.",1049155200,4,233,4.441860465116279
7872206,5,6304474873,"Not only is this the best video travelogue I've ever seen, I suspect that it's one of the best National Geographic productions of any kind. The photography is absolutely breathtaking in its detail - just as good as the still images you'll find in the magazine. Linda Hunt's narration occasionally crosses the line into pomposity but is more often poetic and affecting. And the crew takes you places that only the most intrepid traveler would ever make it to on their own.",985737600,5,471,4.7560975609756095
7872207,5,6304474873,"This is a really neat film for anyone interested in either India or trains (and if you're interested in both, you'll find this a treat). It is very well-made and as someone from India I felt that it tried to be honest and  did relatively little sanitizing, which is what you have to usually do to  portray the harsher realities of India. The film wanders through various  parts of the country and manages to be comprehensive in its coverage  without getting dull at all.  Next time I go to India I must try the  Palace on Wheels !",923788800,5,530,4.357142857142857
