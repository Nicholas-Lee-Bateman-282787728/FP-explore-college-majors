8397367,5,B003IGTKG8,"I have never heard of this movie until recently. Being a fan of Andy Griffith, I wanted to see it and see how it was. I wasn't a bit disappointed. I loved the movie, and me and my wife both had a good time watching it. Thank you so much. Robert Cockerham",1371168000,,254,3.9038461538461537

However, unlike most romantic comedies, the girls aren't desperate romantics, but rather one up the guys at the love game. All of the actors are wonderful. Andy Griffith is absolutely charming as the ""player"" grandfather. The ending has a twist worthy of M. Night Shyamalan. Just a brief warning: there is a lot of talk about sex and scenes insinuating it, especially between the elderly, which can get kind of nasty. It's funny, but sometimes goes a bit too far.",1295222400,,739,5.981132075471698
