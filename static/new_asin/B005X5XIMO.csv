4900598,1,B005X5XIMO,"I really didn't hate this DVD set.  I actually sent it back before I watched it because I wanted the new Poldark version for sure and couldn't afford both.  If I had more money I would get this one too because I love the whole Poldark story.  I have now read all of the books.

4900605,4,B005X5XIMO,"It's old so be prepared for that.  I'm just a little disappointed in it as I tend to compare it to the current Poldark series being aired on PBS for Masterpiece Theater.  That show is first rate and hard to beat.  It's more like a movie whereas this production is more like a stage play.  Also, it's not HD even though it is presented via DVD.  Good picture but definitely not high def.",1502409600,,386,4.232876712328767
4900606,5,B005X5XIMO,"Love British Drama! The filming is not as spectacular as the new version seeing it was filmed decades ago before all the high tech...but, the story line is so much more substantial and the characters are so much more deeply validated. I am torn between both versions, but the first goes into alot more detail of the historical time frame and the characters personalities.",1502150400,4,371,4.8125
4900607,2,B005X5XIMO,"First of all, let me say that I did LOVE this series, and I was glad to find the collection available.

The quality of the disks was lacking.  I have two from the second season that are unwatchable half way through.  I tried them on other devices and had the same problem.

Please be sure to view yours within the time frame of being able to return them.  I waited several weeks to begin viewing them, and by then it was too late to return them.",1501632000,2,445,4.127906976744186

4900609,5,B005X5XIMO,"I finally bit the bullet and purchased this series and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I watched the series on PBS many years ago and after watching it again, I enjoyed it all over again. It was a ground breaking series in the 1970s but doesn't seem very dated. I am completely satisfiedwith my purchase!",1500768000,,311,4.571428571428571
4900610,5,B005X5XIMO,I hate that you've taken this Poldark off to air the new watered down version. I loved the characters in the 70's version the drama the suspense. People need to remember you can't remake the Mona Lisa. Some things are one of a kind and this was one of those series it was one of a kind!! AMAZON BRING IT BACK I'M ABOUT TO DISCONTINUE MY SERVICE.

4900637,5,B005X5XIMO,"There are 12 books to the Poldark series. The 2 seasons in this set only covers about 5 of the books. This was filmed in the mid-1970's. Screenwriters & actors did a great job. You can really see how it could have been in the Cornish late 1700's. Some of the characters had heavy accents, while I knew what was going on....I'm glad for subtitles.
I also purchased the more current Poldark series. So different, yet so much the same. I love both!",1496966400,7,445,4.373493975903615

4900642,2,B005X5XIMO,"This has to be one of the most, if not the worst boring, anticlimactic, predictable saga in British tv. And that's not factoring in actors whose limited emotional range- including the main character-- which just plain annoys! That is the ones whose dialect you can understand! In the character of Judd I believe I understood two sentences in the entire 2 Series on eight, yes eight, discs! Most sorry I purchased. Save your money. I watched the last three discs on fast forward, stopping only once to hear yet another boring, anti-climactic statement  which promised swashbuckling action only to end up  yawning at the expected. The rest was on fast forward and I doubt I missed a thing. It even had a supposedly dead soldier clutching his rifle so it wouldnt fall down the hill and then repoisitioning his ""dead"" body! Each disc was same story different day. Oh my. swashbuckling indeed. Maybe we Americans are just adrenalin junkies unappreciative of the finer aspects of the merely mundane.",1492041600,,993,4.904761904761905
4900643,5,B005X5XIMO,"The thing about this series is that, no matter the stuffy-stage moments, and what seems poor character choices (for example, Elizabeth is incredibly beautiful in the novels, but Jill T.  certainly is not, nor is her acting very exciting) the characters come to life and you call in love with so many of them. I saw this series when it was being reshown on PBS in the early eighties and loved it. I did not see the ending due to going through a nasty divorce, and so was delighted to purchase the series here. If it seems stodgy at first,  hang in there, because it's, to me, unforgettable. The Winston Graham books are wonderful, too - and the manor doesn't burn down in the novels. Al in all I have loved this series more than any other I have ever seen.",1491091200,5,755,4.347517730496454

4900657,3,B005X5XIMO,"It is visually a period piece of the 1970's, with the grainy, VHS look. Acting and editing...even storytelling writing choices are from a different era... and not simply Graham's 1940's, or the 18th century in which the story is set.",1484870400,,233,4.85
4900658,4,B005X5XIMO,"This is a 1970's series and I read reviews that said it was very good, but I was also doubtful that the production values would be hard to take for 21st century viewers. I bought it for my husband as a christmas present and to our surprise it was very addictive. It reminds me a lot of the I Claudius series which aired a few years later, to great critical and audience acclaim.
Some of it may be a little silly now, but a lot of acting is truly great, the story is a potboiler of  scandal, romance and revenge in Cornwall - the backdrop is the climate of England after the american revolutionary war and before the next war with France. In the words of a Blackadder episode, ""a great rollicking rollercoaster of a novel with sizzling gypsies"".  Well, close.
Apparently it was wildly successful, and the actors were commonly mobbed, and some recognized as reviled villains and sex symbols by English  viewers and the viewers of 40 countries around the globe to which the series was distributed. A 1970's Downton Abbey Phenomenon.",1484611200,4,1029,4.581521739130435

4900661,4,B005X5XIMO,"Winston Grahams saga of 18th-century Cornwall has been dramatized twice on TV: once in the 1970s, and once in the 2010s. The modern version, currently running on PBS channels, excels in its psychological acumen and faithfulness to the plot line of Grahams novels. But this 1970s series has a zest and humor which are sorely lacking in the new one. And  with one disastrous exception  the casting and acting in this original series are far superior.

The disastrous exception is Jill Townsend, who is totally wrong for the role of the delicate, aristocratic Elizabeth. But the presence of the sparkling, delightful Angharad Rees more than makes up for this mistake. Rees is the true, definitive Demelza. Accept no substitutes.

Robin Ellis is suitably strong and edgy as Ross Poldark, though admittedly Aidan Turner is equally good and twice as handsome. Ralph Bates is nicely nasty and neurotic as the social-climbing George Warleggan. Unlike Jack Farthing, Bates actually looks as if he might be a blacksmiths grandson. Clive Francis redeems the wimpy Francis Poldark with his dry, self-effacing wit. Paul Curran is hilarious as Jud, even though his speech is sometimes incomprehensible.

The romance and adventure are highly entertaining; the tragedy is poignant, and  most interestingly  the class and economic struggles are still relevant today.  Highly recommended.",1482364800,11,1370,5.310185185185185

Our VCR machine disappeared over time and my wife wanted to watch the series again. $50 is a lot easier to take.

4900701,4,B005X5XIMO,"Of the two versions available on DVD, this is the one that makes the most effort to be true to the books.  Yes, it was done in the 1970s and shot on video.  Yes, much of it looks like a soap opera.  Yes, compared to the new one it looks dated.  However, if you want a much richer, detailed version of the story and a look at the rigid class system in place in England at the time, this is the series to watch.

For me, I got to know and care for the characters over time.  I felt that I was engaged in who the characters were, rather than just seeing a series of events to which the people reacted.  Watching this series got me to Cornwall when I went to the U.K. in 1978, and I saw a number of the locations that appeared in the series.  I love Cornwall to this day.  Unfortunately, so does everybody else; it's been discovered in a big way since then.

If you have the time to invest, and can put up with the factors that make it dated, this is the version for you.  If you are a modern person in a hurry, and want the bare-bones version of a wonderful story, then you should check out the modern version.  And if you're a reader, by all means go straight to the books.  They are wonderful!",1460246400,9,1192,4.0212765957446805

Fantastic story, well-acted, superbly cast. The new version can't begin to compare, though I do like the actor who plays Poldark in it. But no one beats Robin Ellis. This version of the story has far better character development and more interesting stories with more complex sub-plots, with plenty of excellent humor not found in the newer version. It is inconceivable that anyone could better the performances of the actors playing Judd and Prudy (Mary Whimbush plays Prudy; I don't have the Judd's player at hand, though he is fantastic, and is even more amusing in that he has very very sophisticated-sounding name which couldn't be more in contrast with the character he plays so well.

4900737,5,B005X5XIMO,The original series is still exceptional.  The latest remake is OK but lacks the antagonism between Demelza and Elizabeth that is in the books and the original series. I much prefer Judd and Prudy characters in this original version.,1448928000,5,233,4.9743589743589745

4900740,5,B005X5XIMO,"Recently, I watched and reviewed the new Poldark series starring Aiden Turner as Ross Poldark and Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza. This sparked my return to the original series which I delighted in watching in the late 1970s. Both versions are impressive and its impossible to decide which is better. The original unfolds more like a drama flavoured with touches of melodrama. When Captain Ross Poldark returns, presumed dead, from the American Revolution the world he left has been turned upside down. After witnessing the horrors of war and colonialism he has become very much the Enlightenment man. He exploits the privileges of his class to stand up for the interests of the lower classes which is the harbinger of making powerful enemies. His prime enemy throughout the saga is villain, George Warleggan. As charismatic aristocratic rebel, Poldark isn't afraid to the bend the law, engage in acts of civil disobedience or show strong contempt towards members of his class.
Unlike the new series which features an abundance of spectacular outdoor shots, the original version stages elaborate indoor scenes. Like a stage play the dialogue is crucial to the drama and the series relies far more on traditional theatrical virtues due to the lack of modern technology. Leading with Ross Poldark (Robin Ellis) and Demelza (Angharad Rees) the dialogue is sharper, livelier and the rhetoric far more complex. Tempers and jealously flare more readily in the original version. The Warleggans stand out more as crude and ruthless social climbers, even their accent distinguishes them as new money. Similarly contrast in dialogue features strong between the social classes as does the accent resonate strongly with the rugged Cornish coast and landscape.
Class conflict and poverty are often more confronting in the original version. For example, the public beating Demelza receives after stealing to survive. Her transformation first as Ross Poldarks servant then wife seems remarkable. However, given that Poldark is a man of the Enlightenment, marrying a servant from a sense of duty and responsibility is an example of his changed values and Demelza proves his match. Despite this Poldark is at times a conflicted and contradictory character. Sometimes his determination to act as a strong voice for the poor and the injustices they face is overshadowed by his intent to maintain the power and privileges the upper classes benefit from. Similarly, his relationship with cool, porcelain Elizabeth is more elicit and confronting. The rich array of characters regardless of whether they are the beautiful, troubled and almost tragic Morwenna (Jane Wymark) or Jud (Paul Curran) the difficult, often drunk and obnoxious servant these characters and many more are fascinating and mesmerizing to watch.
Passion, betrayal, scandal and conflict along with the suspense and this often moody and brooding saga makes the Poldark series compelling viewing.",1445904000,2,2937,5.331896551724138

However I am very distressed that several terribly important scenes or parts have been left out. There's that wonderful scene you at the ball when Scottish Sergeant shows up in the bedroom of Demelza. We never see George is in his final death battle  with Aunt Agatha; we don't see Whitworth peeking through a hole at his sister-in-law Morwella,  You keep some of the stories not connecting properly because what is left out!  Oh and we never see Caroline and Dwight get married; in this version suddenly they're married. Please acorn put out the complete complete series. I'm hungry for it.

4900788,4,B005X5XIMO,"I love this production: the casting; the costumes; the acting; the writing. To me, Robin Ellis as Ross Poldark is simply luscious! Tall, dark, and noble, yet wild. Angharad Rees's warm and vivacious Demelza is the perfect foil to Jill Townsend's porceline Elizabeth. I would give an enthusiastic five stars except that this collection has been  ""HIGHLY EDITED"". Gone is the scene where Demelza gets a washing under the water pump in the courtyard of the Nampara. Also, the first Garrick is non existent. There are other scenes missing, too. But, everything of importance is there and it is all very enjoyable. One must keep in mind that this production was, for the most part, done in a studio (with lovely sets, I must say) and often looks and feels like a stage play. Just go with it. The acting is wonderful and the characters are so full blown and distinctive from one another that you can get lost in them. Of course, you won't get the gorgeous, travelogue, perfume advert-like  camerawork of the newest production of  the ""Poldark"" saga. The technology just wasn't there in the seventies. But, one still gets a feel for Cornwall and its people. This production also paints a vivid picture of the social struggles of the time period. Rather than approaching the story as a romance with some social conflict thrown in, this interpretation really highlights class conflict and the plight of the poor. So, one comes away with a good idea of how the rich felt about the poor, the law, land ownership, etc. There are no scenes where characters stand on Cornish cliffs, hair blowing in the wind,  romantically gazing across the sea. This is a harsher land than that, and its people have little time for sea gazing.",1441411200,10,1713,4.757575757575758

4900808,5,B005X5XIMO,This original series shown on Masterpiece Theater is just as good as I remembered it to be.  Both this version and the 2015 version are true to the novels but there are some differences between them.  For fans of the BBC's period dramas and Masterpiece Theater this series is well worth adding to your DVD collection.

As other reviewers have stated, this is not HD quality material, so if that's important to you, give this a miss.  If you compare to say Downton Abbey, then Poldark seems almost to be a theater production whereas Downton is more cinematic.

4900883,5,B005X5XIMO,"The harshness of Cornish mining country versus the heat of passion that isn't supposed to be. Bravery on  the battlefield, poor personal choices, hide-bound class system, wide open mountain and seaside setting: this is one of my all-time favorite Masterpiece Theatre productions, and it has stood the test of time. Ross Poldark is the dark hero caught between his upper-class upbringing, and the earthy pleasures of working classes he has to associate with because of his branch of the family's cash-poverty. Add in the ice queen Elizabeth -- whom he loves more from memory than in current reality -- the fiery and beautiful Demelza (one of the great characters of novel and screen), the profligate Frances. Color it with fantastic settings and the peculiar (to American ears) patois of Cornish speech, and you have a series for the ages.",1425427200,3,838,5.028776978417266

Later, when I was in high school, we would rent it from the local town library on VHS, which was not very good quality but it was enjoyable anyway. I have been waiting for over thirty years to obtain this on DVD and so excited that I found it on Amazon at a reasonable price!  Although, we have noticed that it is labeled as the complete collection but noticed some excerpts have been cut out. For example, one of the opening scenes should have had Demelza being thrown in a tub of water in order to get clean after Ross allowed her to come with him from the marketplace. So I am disappointed that scene is not in the complete collection but overall happy to have this wonderful saga. I love that the story has so many episodes and they take time with the plot. The characters, costumes, furniture, music and scenery are so wonderful. They just do not make Masterpiece Classics like this anymore. I guess it would cost too much.",1424822400,11,1060,4.3

4900901,3,B005X5XIMO,"I am huge fan of everything Masterpiece Classics.  For me, this series was ""okay"".  For some reason, I did not feel very invested in any of the characters.  While I am plenty old enough to have watched this in the 70's, I did not.  Nor have I read the books that get such grand reviews.  My review is as a Poldark newcomer, familiar with most period dramas.  I appreciate that this was filmed in the 70's on a limited budget, but it definitely FEELS like that and I'm so glad that I was able to view this in early 2015 nearly for free with my acorn subscription and a roku.  Had I paid for it here on Amazon, I would have been quite disappointed, especially since I do not have any sense of nostalgia of having viewed it 40  some years ago.  The good in this series is definitely the story line itself, the historical look at life in Cornwall and the acting of the main characters, Ross and Demelza.  Memorable performances, to be sure.  The other actors, I didn't even bother to ask ""who is that actor""?  The bad for me was the dated film production, everything very ""olive and brown"" and overcast, it so made me appreciate the beauty of today's Masterpiece Classics.  Some of the dance music was very nice, but the opening score was ill chosen, and frankly, ridiculous.  So glad I could fast forward through that!  Some of the women's outfits also definitely had influence from the 1970's, I didn't mind it, but when one speaks of authenticity, it is noteful that we can SEE the era in which this film was made, the women's hair and head scarves, especially.  Demelza's hair was perfect for a mid-70's hippy!  If you grew up in that era, as I did, you will recognize themes of the 70's.  I would not watch this again.  I'm glad to have seen it and I look forward to the new Poldark to see what a newer generation and technology can add to this great story.  Definitely look into acorn to watch for free...you can get a subscription for 4.99 a month, but the first month is free...so have a look!  (I am not affiliated with them)",1422748800,3,2030,4.36

Time marches on, and so does technology, and I was able to get both series in a single set for $36. And, yes, I still love it! The characters are well-drawn and the setting -- Cornwall in the late 1700s -- comes across much the way I imagine it really was.

Those who are used to modern series with loads of special effects may have to get used to the slower, more stagey style, but the story draws one in. A new version of Poldark is coming out later this year. I'm waiting to see if it's even half as good as the first.",1422057600,3,673,3.841726618705036

4900942,5,B005X5XIMO,"I saw Poldark years ago and even after all these years I still love this series, and still find it interesting and enjoyable to watch. This well cast show, begins with Poldark the main character returning home from the American Revolutionary War and shocking all who believed him dead, to learning about his father's death, and finding his true love engaged to his cousin. One disapointment after another follows him as he tries to get his life back on track and get the family home back in working condition after his drunken caretakers have abused the place. It takes a lot of unusual twists and turns along the way, and the fact that it has a truly talented group of actors makes the story seem real. I didn't want this one to end. The BBC did a great job with Poldark.  I understand that the BBC is doing a remake, I can't imagine any other cast playing these characters, I only wish that they would do a coninuation of this story and tell us what happened when the children grew up and found out the truth about the family secrets.",1406332800,8,1036,4.4526315789473685

4900945,5,B005X5XIMO,"For many years I heard people refer to this series in ""hushed tones"" of reverence.  Now that I finally see it, I understand why.  Now - you must understand - this is older tv drama, so some of it is very stagey and set-bound.  But if you are able to set that aside, it has a much bigger world than many miniseries of the day.  As soon as it begins to feel too caged in, there are action segments out of doors which made this series a favorite of my father (who watches mostly westerns and war movies).  It is the rare mini-series that can appeal to men and women - like Downton Abbey of today.  This one also deals quite a bit with class issues, and the inequality of the law, which bring a depth of reality to the subject matter.",1401753600,2,730,4.105633802816901

4900948,5,B005X5XIMO,"When this series was on Masterpiece Theater way back when, I loved the episodes.  Unfortunately, it was on at a time prior to our having a video recorder of any type.  I have often wanted to watch the series again.  The day my DVDs came, I watchjed every episode and it was as good as I remembered it being.

The lighting and the staging is pure 1970s, but that is part of what gives the series its charm.  Robin Ellis is charming and roguish and perfectly cast as Ross Poldark, proud, wounded by his cousin who marries his fiance whilke he is away at war, concerned for the welfare of the miners who depend upon him for jobs/income, brave, but humble when complimented on his prowess in battle or rescuing friends.

Ross and Demelza have a tumultuous relationship  because they are both strong personalities that have been wounded by thoses who should have loved them better so they nearly alwayd assume the worst about each other's intentions.  But they are well matched which is best shown when Demelza bankrupts the family in an attempt to keep their friend's bank afloat when the Warleggan Family (owners of a rival bank) attempt to get rid of the competition and give themselves a clear way to run roughshod over the entire county.

The setting for the story is Corwall about 1800 so the costumes and the sea just ooze romance.  This is a wonderful series which I am eager to watch again.",1397520000,3,1394,4.562248995983936

Over the course of several days, I watched the entire set, and it was like visiting with cousins you haven't seen for a long time.  Wonderfully engrossing, with characters that you care about.

4900950,5,B005X5XIMO,"My husband and I always remembered how back in the pre-VCR 1970's missing a Poldark episode was excruciating.  But we'd forgotten why--the cliff hangers.  By far the best way to watch this series is to have the next episode immediately available.  This series was the action packed Downton Abbey of its day.  For me, it has held up nicely.  The costumes are gorgeous, the drama gripping, and best of all the through line is planned.  That's to say, it wasn't like the final episodes of Larkspur to Candleford where the ending episodes felt rushed (and that is the only complaint I have about that great series).

The DVDs are nicely packaged and organized.  There are some extra materials I haven't viewed yet, but will the next time I watch the series.  I don't know why this isn't available on Amazon Prime or Netflix, but the price of the set is reasonable and the story is wonderful!",1391644800,10,887,4.634615384615385

4901004,5,B005X5XIMO,"I saw the trailer for this show on my Upstairs Downstairs DVD and wasn't sure what to expect. I  enjoyed the rebellious nature of Ross Poldark and eventually I'd like to read the books on which the show was based.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching him navigate life using his own moral compass much to the chagrin of some of his fellow landowners. Each episode ended with a cliffhanger that made me want to watch more. The show lasted two full seasons which is enough to see the big story arcs come to a conclusion and without it becoming too much of a soap opera.

I would highly recommend it if you're a fan of British costume dramas--especially if you're looking for one that isn't an Austen or Dickens adaptation.",1371513600,,714,4.51937984496124

4901011,5,B005X5XIMO,"Back in the late 1970s I remember a couple of summers when Sunday night's Masterpiece Theater had me utterly transfixed.  Poldark was a swashbuckling tale of late 18th century Cornwall. Captain Ross Poldark has returned from service in the British Army after the American Revolution to find his father dead, his estate gone to rack and ruin, and his beloved Elizabeth engaged to his cousin Francis.  Season 1 focusses on Ross's continuing love for Elizabeth, his struggle to make his tin and copper mines profitable, and his growing love for Demelza, a young girl he takes in as a servant, marries out of duty after making her pregnant, then finds her to be an ideal life partner. Most of all, there is the rivalry between Poldark and the ambitious George Warleggan, a story which symbolizes the changes in England as a rising newly wealthy class, founded on industry and sharp business practices, challenges the power of the older gentry families.  Season 2 continues to chronicle Ross and Demelza's doings but also introduces several new characters, most importantly Morwenna, Elizabeth's beautiful cousin who loves Demelza's brother Drake but is forced into marriage with an odious clergyman instead.

This is a barebones description of the lengthy but always fascinating main plot with its multitudinous twists and turns.  There are many sideplots as well, including the love of Francis's sister Verity for a sea captain with a dark past, the simple miner Mark Daniel who tragically falls in love with a beautiful actress, the young Dr. Enys who plays a role in Mark Daniel's tragedy then falls in love with the witty Caroline Penvenen, and the hilarious servants Jud and Prudie Paynter.  Watching Poldark again after so many years is fun, though some of the soap operaish touches and melodramatic musical flourishes seem a bit over done. I'm very glad to have the complete and unedited series on DVD.  Previously I had owned box VHS sets of both seasons, but they were clumsily edited with a lot of the subplots truncated or even done away with completely.  Now I can watch Ross's ups and downs, along with those of his friends, family, servants, and enemies, whenever I choose, and I will choose to do so often!",1369353600,17,2217,4.924932975871314
4901012,3,B005X5XIMO,"I loved this saga when I first saw it back in the 1980's, and I loved it even more when I was able to purchase it here in the States.  Unfortunately, series one and two are billed as the ""complete"" series. They are not. There should have been at least 3 more discs to complete the last of the episodes. The story would make a great deal more sense if it had been brought to its final conclusion.

Also, given the cost, it would have been more acceptable and less predatory had the American reproduction been digitized. While the scenery and the cast of English actors are wonderful, the color, sound and overall quality of the tape leave a great deal to be desired. The discs should have been re-mastered.

Hopefully,the producers and distributors of these series will step up to the plate in the future and deliver the full story instead of just a chopped off version. A sense of pride in your workmanship and some integrity would have been appreciated.

After watching it one episode after the other, we wondered how we had the patience to wait for each week to pass until the show was on again. We thoroughly enjoyed the dvd. In some parts it seemed over acted, in others you wished that the characters would seem a little more realistic. But when you consider the qualities of a true romance, Poldark filled the bill.

It was a little slow getting started and we were not sure if we were going to like it, but we gave it a chance and we are really enjoying it...tremendously.  There are really some characters in it that liven things up.  If you like period pieces you may want to give it a try.  I paid $28.49 for it and feel it is a deal for the amount of entertainment we are getting.  I cannot imagine what we would spend to go to the movies for this amount of hours and we don't have to worry about getting a cold or the flu!
2/1/13  UPDATE...we finally finished this series.  We really enjoyed it.  Yes, there are some weak moments here and there, but very few productions of this length will be without flaws.  If you like period pieces and a soap opera style you will probably enjoy this.  By soap opera style I mean for everything great that happens....in seconds there is a tragedy.

The characters are easy to follow and very believable, particularly impulsive Captain Poldark with his own sense of right and wrong and how to make justice in the world. I really enjoyed this series and would highly recommend it for British period lovers.

4901085,5,B005X5XIMO,"The picture-quality of this satisfying series is just fine, much better than expected; set your television to ""vivid"" if needed, to intensify colors. There's an old Cornish saying, ""the Devil is afraid to come to Cornwall for fear of being baked into a pasty."" The story is even more engaging than I recalled, from viewing it in the late 1970s. The cast is superb, all the actors are wonderfully involved and convincing. This classic stands the test of time. The swashbuckling Captain Ross Poldark is perfectly played by Robin Ellis; Series 1 contains an informative excerpt from the first chapter of his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Making-Poldark/dp/0983939829/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Making Poldark</a>. Poldark's Demelza, that delightful, elfin redhead, is brought to life by the fine (why isn't she more famous?) Welsh actress Angharad Rees. Jill Townsend is cold perfection as Demelza's rival, Cousin Elizabeth.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders/dp/B0011B9W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders</a>&nbsp;fans will delight in a very young Jane Wymark as the lovely Morwenna. Poldark's nemesis, George Warleggan, is perfectly embodied by Ralph Bates. Trudie Styler (Sting's wife) plays a village slattern, Emma Tregirls, who torments Demelza's devout brother Sam with her tawdry wares. Poldark's servants Jud Paynter (remarkable Scottish actor Paul Curran) and his wife Prudie (Mary Wimbush) are constant scene-stealers; the episode written by Peter Draper, featuring Jud's resurrection from the dead during a drunken wake, is a hilarious must-see. The narrative is so well-rendered by the wonderful cast that it overcomes Series 2's unfortunate `70s era background music. Morwenna meets Demelza's bother Drake again, with his lovely declaration. Oddly, instead of Ross and Demelza, the saga concludes with George Warleggan's torment; an abrupt ending indeed. After viewing such rarified, excellent fare as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B005Q1W10A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>, the rough authenticity of this Cornish show has its own allure. Considering when it was created, it's remarkable what a sizable portion of the narrative was filmed outside, along the rugged Cornish coastline. The hard lives of lower classes is explored quite effectively, against a rich historical background referring to the American and French Revolutions, and the difficult lives of Cornish miners displaced during difficult economic times. Having family from Redruth, Cornwall, and knowing of Cornish migrations to the American West, I appreciate this vivid depiction of Cornish life, from the gentry, to the villagers.

4901086,5,B005X5XIMO,"I remembered the ""Poldark"" TV Series when it ran for the first time in 1975, and never forgot it. Based on the first few books of the Winston Graham series of the same name, ""Poldark"" was well cast and well executed, given the limited BBC budgets of the time, and the clumsy mix of indoor video and outside 16mm film recording.
  I was delighted to find recently that the entire two-year series was available on DVD. This after having also discovering that through Amazon I could amass all twelve novels, which go into great detail about the life in late 18th and early 19th Century Cornwall.
  Robin Ellis plays Ross Poldark, a British army captain returning in defeat from the American War, in a darkly-handsome way, exhibiting both great charm and deep uneasiness as his fortunes rise and fall. Angharad Rees as Demelza, his street waif-turned-Mistress of the House, has to be one of the most charming roles produced by the BBC in that era of television experimentation. The rest of the cast was chosen with great care, and all fulfill their roles with excellence.

4901092,5,B005X5XIMO,"Poldark is the 1790s. It's British Cornwall delightful; exquisite sets, locations, costuming & dialogue. Robin Ellis is Ross Poldark, and winning awards in the process. Writer, Winston Graham, gives us a sensual look at 18th century life in rural, SW England. It's no wonder the show has been considered one of the all-time great Masterpiece Theatre works. It is timeless, one you will watch repeatedly. Angharad Rees is Demelza Poldark, Jill Townsend is Elizabeth Warleggan, & Ralph Bates plays Geo. Warleggan, the villain of the series. You'll laugh at Jud (Paul Curran.)

Two families become rivals in Series one and continue the same through episodes (called parts on the DVD) filled with suspense, ambition, swashbuckling action, romance, humor, heroics, historical drama, betrayal, and just about any other element of passion and emotion possible by bickering families. A saga you will enjoy, and don't overlook Series One, now discounted to a very affordable value.

Series 1 & 2 is 32 parts, each almost an hour, all WITH SUBTITLES, and remarkably fine given the fact it was originally aired in 1977. BBC excellence. The second half also provides a different look at Jane Wymark (playing Morwenna) who is known for her role as Joyce Barnaby in ""Midsomer Murders."" She is good. Morwenna meets Drake (Kevin McNally-""Pirates of the Caribbean"") & Judy Geeson is Caroline. Accolades could go on forever for cast and the story. Minimal musical background make ""Poldark"" seem something of a stage presentation with outlandishly sophisticated sets.",1323820800,137,1548,5.2631578947368425
4901093,5,B005X5XIMO,"I absolutely loved watching this series when they were showing it about 15 yrs after it's first airing on our PBS station. So, once it was over I went to the library and read the books. The books were written by Winston Graham (original author of the book of ""Marnie"" that Hitchcock changed and filmed). There were changes. There had to be, since there were quite a number of novels to cover. But I thought both novels and TV were very good. I learned a lot about England after the war that we Americans call 'The Revolutionary War'. I learned a lot about mining in those days too, and it was fascinating. But of course, the story of the people is the main reason that we watch and read this great series. Americans have to remember how British television differed from American at the time it was made (1975). Much of the time it feels more like a stage play videotaped with a handheld camera. Once you deal with that it is a wonderful experience. It was always hard to wait for the next week's episode. Also, in answer to the first reviewer and anyone else that is concerned about subtitles not being mentioned. If you look up the site of the company that put this series onto DVD (Acornonline.com), you will see in the ""Details"" section that they do have ""SDH"", which stands for ""Subtitled for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing"". So, there should at least be English subtitles available. This is an important issue to me as well. I am excited to get the series.",1323129600,117,1459,4.447761194029851

Unfortunately,  the season 3 video repeats  everything on those DVDs I've already watched in this Collection Pack. I don't understand how that could be, and none of it was set up in season 3 as it was in seasons 1&2. Extremely disappointed in season 3 dvd.",1517875200,,421,4.384615384615385
