1214373,5,B00000FZD7,"This is as fun and enjoyable a movie as I have seen for some time.  The early days of film produced some wonderful movies, and this 1932 classic is more fun that a barrel full of monkeys.  Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., plays a happy-go-lucky fellow who is so taken by the beauty of the uninhabited islands of the South Seas that he decides to forego his intended hunting expedition and settle on the nearest deserted island.  His friend bets him he will be tied to a stake by cannibals by the time the ship returns the next year, and he in turn swears he will turn the island into his own private Manhattan.  With one thousand dollars riding on this friendly bet, Fairbanks' unnamed character jumps into the water and makes for shore with absolutely nothing but the shirt on his back; his loyal dog follows him, and they quickly set up shop on the island.  This guy may have led a pretty easy life, but he is amazingly adept at island-settling; he makes the Professor look like Gilligan.  After finding food, water, and a suitable spot for shelter, he's immediately making his own tools and making a mockery of the term ""roughing it.""  He builds an impressive house (set on stilts, no less) and all kinds of furniture, sets traps for catching game, and creates his own private work force of animals.  His Dr. Doolittle skills soon have his pet monkey milking a captured goat, the goat operating a treadmill under the supervision of the dog, a tortoise slowly turning a wheel to power a sort of water wheel, and that's just the beginning.  He builds his own 18-hole golf course, has the monkey trained to bring him drinks at ""the 19th hole,"" makes his own radio out of slightly more than a couple of coconuts, and does other things Robinson Crusoe would never have even dreamed of.  Throughout it all, he is happy as a clam.
When a native from a nearby island turns up on the island, he easily manhandles him and tries to turn him into his own Friday-noting the fact the guy is a headhunter, he laughingly jests that he must be Friday the 13th.  Friday doesn't work out too well, but he has better luck when an attractive native woman finds her way to the island after running away to escape a forced marriage.  Typically, he calls her Saturday, and the two get along famously despite the language barrier.  There's trouble later, when angry islanders invade his private paradise, but nothing gets to this guy.  There is one aspect about the ending I didn't particularly like, but overall this movie boasts swashbuckling action and great family-oriented fun from start to finish.  I especially loved the animals featured prominently in the film; the dog and monkey in particular deserved their own trailers on the set because they were bona fide great actors.  A final appeal of the movie is the scenery; although black and white can't truly capture their mystical beauty, the islands of Tajiti, Fiji, Samoa and other genuine South Sea islands serve as the lavish backdrop for the wild island adventure.",1044489600,9,2996,4.656546489563567

1214385,4,B00000FZD7,"The movie is a lot of fun. Especially the Rube Goldberg devices that the set designers on the film came up with for Fairbanks to have built out of bamboo, coconut shells, and palm fronds. The only thing wrong is that this movie like way too many on Amazon Prime video, is a very poor print, murky soft focus, poor contrast and very scratchy and noisy sound. I saw this film once when I was a kid, probably back in the 1950's and had wondered what it was titled, and have been on the lookout for it ever since. When I saw Amazon's capsule description of it, I knew it was the one I had been looking for...",1482624000,,604,4.127118644067797

He must have been desperate for money.  This certainly could not have brought him any fame.  Cringeworthy is the first word that comes to mind.  I gave it one star only because Amazon does not have a negative stars rating available.",1482537600,,482,4.382022471910112

1214388,3,B00000FZD7,"Perhaps I'm rating to harshly based on the moving being almost as old as my father, but the action was ridiculously melodramatic.  Douglas Fairbanks spent far too much time posturing with his hands on his hips and his head thrown back like a victorious pirate, laughing like a prototype laugh track, and bouncing up and down like he was on a miniature trampoline.

The plot was a fairly routine man conquers nature with typical plot holes like an absolute lack of rain in the South Pacific and a man who not only didn't struggle to start a fire, but repeated the lack of struggle every day, apparently.  (If he had the survival skills he was purported to have, he would have known to save himself the effort and bank the fire at night...)",1481846400,,738,4.533834586466165

1214391,4,B00000FZD7,"If you like B&W frothy, bubbly, silly Hollywood movies that only slightly resemble the real world, this is your campy film! The beginning was so horrible, with the dialog and signs giving the audience the anthropological background of what they were seeing, it was almost too awful for me. The music recording is tinny and horrible, but I had to keep the volume up to hear any of the dialog.  However, in the years when this movie was made, and other reviewers have a lot of correct opinions on how different peoples were portrayed in this, we have to remember that ""Polynesia"" was just becoming known to most Americans. Hawai'i' wasn't even a state,and US folks were just enthralled with the idea of Shangri-la, and were there any places left on Earth as an unspoiled Paradise?  Most people hadn't even tasted fresh pineapple in the continental US when this came out, so anything that had that 'South Seas' tone to it was very hip and glamorous, etc. People thought putting a slice of canned pineapple on a burger or a casserole instantly made it a recipe from the islands. Yes, it's unbelievable and I'm sure parts of it are very offensive to many in its ignorance, buffoonery and white arrogance, but it is a glimpse into what Hollywood was cranking out to satisfy movie audiences. For a few coins, they could sit in the theater, see the palm trees and everything stereotypical 'island culture'  reference dumbed down for the white folks, no real headhunting or bloody scenes, etc. etc.,Does anyone remember how SPECIAL it seemed when you knew someone going to Hawai'i, Tahiti, etc.?I'm sure propaganda like this just increased peoples' desires to go to these unspoiled places. If you want to ENJOY this movie, you've got to drop all that at the door, and just watch this for what it is, or rather, was -- a glimpse into an earlier time, with an attempt at making it 'correct', but mixing cultures/people in such a way that the folks of today cannot bear. I doubt the 'islanders' had no creative control over how they were depicted, if they ever got to see the finished movie. And yes, several actors DID suffer terribly in the transition to sound, so I had to keep that in mind with the over-dramatized acting and that LAUGHING (it does get on the nerves, like what is HE ON? Must be the island cocktail he invents) .This would be a fascinating remake, a la Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"", but maybe in a lighter tone..

1214427,3,B00000FZD7,I did enjoy the old movie to a point but his laugh was driving me crazy. Good idea just poorly acted you have to remember when film started they had no sound so the only way to let the audience know what they were saying by their face and body movements a lot of big names didn't have a voice for sound and faded away the sound actors came from stage where they had to speak up so people in the back could hear. When sound took over the writers wrote for stage actors and the directors directed as if it was a stage play that's what you will be seeing in this movie.  These actors came from silent movies most all Fairbanks movies he was a lancer or musketeer you mite say he jumped around a lot putting his hands on his hip like superman he just couldn't break himself of it. It wasn't till the new actors came along that had never did stage or silent started acting and talking normal with no special face or body movement to emphasize the scene.

1214444,3,B00000FZD7,"This video was a gift for a family friend who'd remembered seeing this with his parents in the theater when he was a small boy.  It is a film rarity, in that it was one of Douglas Fairbanks' few 'talkies'.  When seeing it, I found it to be a breezy, light weight version of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe story, updated to the (then) modern times of the 1930s, with Fairbanks as a playboy/adventurer cruising with friends on a yacht in the south Pacific.  The group happens upon what appears to be an uninhabited island prompting a conversation of idyllic life and self reliance.  Fairbanks' bravado brings about a 'bet' in which he claims he can survive and thrive on the island with few tools and no modern amenities.  He plunges into the waters, swimming to shore, his yacht mates pledging to return in some months to check up on him and determine the outcome of the bet.  What ensues during the film is how he goes about his life on the island and his interactions with an island tribe and their runaway princess.  The film, made following Fairbanks' heyday as a box office swashbuckler, is quaint by modern standards and fairly predictable, but I must admit I viewed it with a curious interest.  It does tend to stretch credibility in a few instances and is cliched, by modern standards, however it was entertaining.  Add a star more to the rating if you're a fan of early talkies, and especially one of Fairbanks Sr's. followers.",1389830400,,1428,4.612648221343873

1214448,2,B00000FZD7,"Mr. Robinson Crusoe, 1932 film

The players include native people from Tahiti, Fiji, Samoa, and the Marquesas islands. The story claims every man has an urge to leave civilization and get back to nature where there is freedom in a primitive paradise. A ship sails the South Seas. One man says he would like to live like Robinson Crusoe on an island, and makes a bet of $1,000. [A large sum then]. He harvests a coconut for water. His dog Rooney finds a stream. A flat rock is used for an axe. He has accomplished a lot alone. [Believable?]

A firearms permit is needed in the Dutch East Indies. [How odd for 1932 America.] The men hunt for tigers using beaters to drive the game to the hunters. Back on the island a trap catches a goat. Elsewhere a marriage is planned, but the girl changes her mind and runs away. There are more scenes of mechanical devices. A net is thrown into the sea for fishing. Robinson sees strange footprints in the sand. There is conflict. Can he build a radio? [Only in Hollywood.] The runaway bride arrives at the island. The radio brings news of civilization.

A ship lands at the big island. The man has a plan to win the bet by using the natives to scare Robinson off his island. They land and truss Robinson. But the sound of the radio scares them for a while. But a new group of strangers with a bad intent arrive on the island. They've got to leave quickly! Will the pursuers slip up? Robinson escapes to the boat. ""That's $2,000 you owe me."" ""Saturday"" comes along as a passenger. She will star as a hula dancer in the ""Ziegfield Follies"". And so the story ends.

You could call this ""escapist entertainment"". One leaves civilization for a primitive island, then returns. A young woman leaves her primitive island for civilization. The society on that primitive island seems to be as structured as our civilized society. [The house and other mechanisms are pure Hollywood hokum and not cost effective in that setting. Those who live mostly outdoors have only small shacks for minimal shelter.",1268611200,3,2028,4.578512396694215

The premise is a cute one:Fairbanks bets his rich friends that he can survive on a deserted island for an entire year on just his own creative ingenuity.

It's not believable,but that's not the point either.
This is escapist fantasy and it's a darn infectious one,too!

Fairbainks constructs a ridiculous tree house for himself with all the ""modern"" conveniences(circa. 1932) including a radio(!) and help from his pet Monkey,Parrot, and Dog,the only other companion that joined him on the island.

Eventually he comes across a beautiful woman that ran away from her tribe that predictably falls for cool guy,Fairbanks.
However,her tribe and some other not so friendly natives from neighboring islands decide to invade.

What I love about this film is how it does not have to resort to violence to solve this problem,and it ends on a fun,happy note with Fairbanks returning to home with his pets and his girl.

And he sure gets that native chick a great job!

Absolutely harmless film that is truly feel good,especially in this pessimistic age,reccomended for the film buff who needs something to smile about.

True to his word, within 2 months time he has created every manner of contraption to recreate his life of ease. He captures animals and humans to create servants. He builds a radio and a raised hut that is quite impressive. It's a rather unrealistic story as in real life one would get hurt, and the weather would act up a lot more. Steve never faces a bad wind. He also gets a monkey to milk a goat and his dog to keep another goat walking on a treadmill. In real life it would take 2 months just to train the animals. But no matter, we watch to be amused by all the ingenious contraptions made from palm leaves and coconuts. Steve's love of life is infectious and bordering on mania, but it gets him through.
