7071403,4,B00UUOVG0Y,The first postwar anti-war film out of Germany.,1437350400,,47,5.0
7071404,5,B00UUOVG0Y,"This unforgettable 1959 anti-war film is a powerful reminder that there was a strong postwar German cinema before the 1970s breakout of Fassbinder, Herzog, and Wenders. What Bernhard Wicki does in THE BRIDGE is an agonizing attempt to reconcile love of Germany with hatred for what Germans did to themselves and for what the monstrous madness of war does to all of us. Crisp black and white photography, and images--both tender and harsh--that will burn themselves into your memory.",1436659200,12,482,5.113924050632911
7071405,5,B00UUOVG0Y,"A moving, superb film that should be seen by parents and children.  THIS is what war does to the youngsters. Tragic film.  Great blu-ray from Criterion!!",1436400000,9,153,4.846153846153846
7071406,5,B00UUOVG0Y,"""The Bridge"" stands near the top of a film genre populated by superb works; The anti-war film. Any list of such films as ""The Cruel Sea"" ""Platoon"" ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" ""Das Boot"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", would be incomplete without ""The Bridge.""

Filmed in spartan black and white, well directed and acted, and populated with complex characters who most people can relate to, The Bridge delivers its sad message of the waste, confusion and futility of war, especially when children are suddenly made into soldiers, in a profoundly despairing way.  There is no glory to war in this film, only futility and madness. The film's melancholy is almost as if the innocent characters of Sesame Street were suddenly transported from their utopian environs, jammed into uniform, and put on a search and destroy mission during Platoon's Vietnam War, or made crew members of  Das Boot's u-boat. And The Bridge is largely unique and memorable precisely because of its sense of sadness.

That said, The Bridge is not a perfect film. Some of the special effects are not well done; the tanks are obviously cars/trucks draped with canvas and painted olive drab. There are some sound editing errors where explosions are shown without the sound. However, considering Germany's shattered economy when the film was made the production values are good. In spite of its few, and small flaws, The Bridge unfailingly delivers its message. If only all films, including most of today's mega-budget film extravaganzas could boast of the same accomplishment.

The Bridge is a superb film which one is unlikely to forget.",1435708800,35,1600,5.045454545454546

8708413,5,B00UUOVG0Y,"There were two European films about youth in W.W. II that came out in 1959 that have always remained in my memory as the most powerful statements against war I have seen.  One was the Russian ""Ballad of a Soldier"" and the other was the German ""The Bridge"".  While ""Ballad of a Soldier"" has been available in various formats going back to Laserdisc (including a DVD from Criterion), ""The Bridge"" has been unavailable.  Now Criterion has rectified that omission.  The story of a group of high school boys assigned in the last days of the war to ""protect"" a bridge that is to be blown up the next morning is particularly heartbreaking as the first half of the film takes time to fill in the boy's backstories.  The excellent Criterion extras reveal that the author of the book the film is based on, as a Nazi youth actually lived through an experience quite close to what is depicted.  Interestingly, the director was detained in a German prison camp as a ""radical"".  Even though the view is from the German side, the futility of the boy's ""mission"" evokes great sympathy for them as doomed pawns in a situation they are too young to grasp. For being so close to the end of the War, the American ""enemy"" is portrayed with great empathy as also being caught up in a tragic situation. The black and white transfer as usual with Criterion releases is pristine and while the soundtrack is mono, it effectively raises the tension as the as yet unseen tanks start toward the bridge. ""The Bridge"" remains something of a classic that belongs in the company of it's American counterpart about W.W. I ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".",1445472000,,1621,4.607638888888889
8708414,5,B00UUOVG0Y,Fine,1443312000,,4,4.0
8708415,5,B00UUOVG0Y,"Here is a film to stand tall beside All Quiet On The Western Front. An Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film for 1959, I am mystified by the relative obscurity of this movie in terms of discussions when it comes to ranking the great anti-war productions of the twentieth century. Director Bernhard Wicki's brilliant direction and his cast of superlative young actors make for an unforgettable viewing experience. Technical credits are exemplary. The Bridge is a masterpiece.",1442102400,,481,5.17948717948718
8708416,5,B00UUOVG0Y,"Interesting anti-war film from the German point of view.  Highly recommend, well worth watching.",1440460800,3,96,5.857142857142857
8708417,5,B00UUOVG0Y,"This is a very interesting movie that gives insight into the life of a small German town and it's very young teenage boys, towards the very end of WWII.",1438905600,4,152,4.275862068965517
8708418,5,B00UUOVG0Y,"Powerful German anti war film. Bernhardt Wicki's film of youth lost to the horrors of war, powerfully acted by a bunch of young unknowns, so that death can come unexpectedly. Though some of the sets and battles are less than realistic, probably due to budgetary constraints, the emotions are apparent. As for the Criterion Bly Ray transfer, there are signs of age, but this is probably as good as the film will ever look in our lifetime.",1438300800,7,437,4.688311688311688
