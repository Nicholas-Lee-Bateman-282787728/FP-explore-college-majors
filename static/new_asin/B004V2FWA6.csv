8442721,4,B004V2FWA6,"The film is well-made and well-acted by all concerned, though I found some of the writing for Munim's character a bit inconsistent. Khanna is solid, and Chopra very effectively underplays his bad guy. He's quite convincing as a dude who believes in ""breaking rocks with glass."" Kolhapure, a young teenager when the film was made, gives a highly charismatic performance that makes me want to see a lot more of her work. I wish her character had a little feistiness, though that would have made for a different story -- yeah, the one _I'd_ have written. (Note that the IMDb credits, and ergo the synopsis given here, erroneously reverse the roles played by Munim and Kolhapure in the film.)",1306281600,,688,4.7899159663865545
