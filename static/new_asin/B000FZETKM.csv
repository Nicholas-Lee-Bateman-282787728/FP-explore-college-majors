Whale of a Birthday/Karate Island

Before the fourth season came on the air, rumors were floating around that creator Stephen Hillenburg left the show after making the Spongebob movie, yet if you look in the credits of the season 4 episodes, you see that he still remains in his Executive Producer post. Regardless, whether he left his post or not, SpongeBob still remains as the best cartoon on TV so far. Granted, there has been a noticeable decline coming from the first few episodes in this set, but then things started to get better and funnier as the show went on; It seemed the season took a while to find its legs.

As you can see, the SpongeBob has always been trying something new: We get an entire episode focused on Spongebob's silly laugh (see Funny Pants), and a sixth Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy episode, which although it's not as good as the other MM&BB episodes, I still find it quite funny, because it plays a joke on the stupidity of Hollywood making mediocre movies based on things we know and love; there's also not one, but two episodes that are truly 30 minutes long-Have You Seen This Snail and Dunces and Dragons-and not marred half the half-hour episode by the annoying Patchy the Pirate; Mr. Krabs does something to his restaurant, the Krusty Krab, by selling it to sludge-making food company in Selling Out, and turning the restaurant into a hotel in one of the funniest episodes ever, Krusty Towers; And we finally get to see what happens when Patrick becomes as smart as a scientist in Patrick Smartpants, and what happens when SpongeBob and Squidward ""stick together"" in an experimental accident in SquidBob TentaclePants, claimed by SpongeBob's voice Tom Kenny as his favorite episode. There's still plenty more content to check out in this set.

In addition, the set also includes a behind-the-scenes featurette on the voices behind the SpongeBob cast, and two animatics of the episodes Fear of a Krabby Patty and Dunces and Dragons. Although all this seems really good, I am quite confused; this set contains half the season when already the previous three DVD sets came out with three full seasons. Paramount should've waited for the show to complete its full season and realeased that full season on DVD then. But either way, I hope the set comes at a reasonable price, just like the other sets.",1151712000,23,2796,4.867647058823529

2594615,3,B000FZETKM,"Note: This is more of an overview of the episodes on this set, but I do talk about the DVD as well

I was an enormous Spongebob fan, which wasn't humiliating in the slightest because the show was actually terrific. In fact, my favorite cartoon at the time, because the Simpsons was on an unheard of (at the time) downfall and I needed something to fill the void. I couldn't believe that a show seemingly so childish and merchandised to death could be so entertaining. I'd be lying if I said I didn't eagerly anticipate premiere episodes in the early 2000s... however I rarely did see brand-new ones because the schedule for the third season was exhausting and very sporadic. It took over two years to air the third season and some episodes I saw for the first time in reruns even though I was trying to follow it. Now, it was early 2005, the movie had come out and rocked my socks, and Spongebob was on a hiatus for a while. I wasn't quite as into it as before due to owning season 1 and 2 already and watching them to death, as well as season 3 reruns. I was sort of exhausted by all the Spongebob. However, I managed to tune into the season premiere, and... well I loved it. Sort of. The first segment, ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"" was great and I still do like that episode, however, something seemed off about ""Shell of a Man"", and I was sort of unimpressed... I couldn't quite put my finger on what was off until ""The Lost Mattress"", in the beginning of the episode Mr. Krabs is hurt by back problems and takes his pain out on Spongebob in a manner that's insanely uncharacteristic of the show. He screams his dialogue really fast and very rudely. It was the weirdest moment of the show at that point, and it wasn't funny. The rest of the episode was fine, but by this time most of the episodes were progressively getting worse with more and more moments like that. I eventually stopped tuning in to new episodes or even re-runs because they were getting very annoying. I recently purchased Season 4 volumes 1 and 2 here and re-watched them all... and they weren't nearly as annoying as I originally thought. It's the exact opposite of Family Guy season 4, which gets worse and worse when you watch it, in which this one just sort of gets better. Now, mind you there are still very annoying episodes, and some unbearable ones. However, I find myself just enjoying most of these due to their fast and carefree nature. The DVDs are sharp looking and have quality audio. For example, the well song in ""Wishing You Well"" (easily the best episode in this collection by the way) sounds great on my TV. There are some animatics on disc 1 and a couple little promotional features on disc 2, but that's it in terms of extras, unfortunately. I would've liked some pop-up trivia as that feature was very helpful on seasons 2 and 3, but alas it doesn't exist here. So, yeah. Apart from a few annoying episodes (""Good Neighbors"", ""Funny Pants aka My Personal Hell"", ""Dunces and Dragons"" and on a lesser extent ""Ghost Host"", etc.), the fact that they ran this season into the ground even longer than season 3, and the fact that Nick went all Mr. Krabs and split them up into two volumes to get more money, this is a decent set and I have no problems welcoming it into my collection. But I dunno about that Volume 2...",1372550400,,3304,4.416393442622951
2594616,5,B000FZETKM,"I don't understand why people are complaining about these episodes.  I now that a few are not really good, but most of them are.  I really like these episodes and everyone else should.",1307836800,,184,4.545454545454546
2594617,3,B000FZETKM,"Disc 1
""Fear of a Krabby Patty"": Mr. Krabs changes the Krusty Krab's opening hours to 24 in order to compete with the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob is thrilled at first, but begins to snap after over a month of ""non-stop service"". The situation turns out to be an elaborate scheme by Plankton, who disguised himself as a psychiatrist and attempts to get SB into handing over the Krabby Patty formula. Less good then previous episodes, but still decent. You may notice slightly weaker writing, strange animation, and poor characterization beginning to blossom in this episode. - 7/10
""Shell of a Man"": Mr. Krabs molts his shell prior to a scheduled reunion with his Naval buddies. SB poses as Mr. K. and goes to the ceremony, but it appears he may not be man enough for the role of ""Armor-Abs Krabs"". Here is where the serious lack in writing and characterization become more apparent. Still good, though. - 6/10
""The Lost Mattress"": Mr. Krabs is acting cranky around work because of his lumpy mattress, so SB and Patrick fetch him a new one. Squidward tries to hog all the credit by disposing of the old mattress, but as it turns out, all of Mr. K.'s money was stored within. Boring, unfunny, lame, surprising sympathy towards Squidward, and some crappy predictable gags (when Squid says ""I am not going to get hurt this time,"" for example. It was so obvious, why state it?). This is where the series really begins to loose its magic. - 4/10
""Krabs vs. Plankton"": Plankton sues Mr. K. after slipping on the KK floor and sues him. Slightly better, but gags are still somewhat silly and dry (the nailed ""Wet Floor"" sign, for example). - 7.5/10
""Have You Seen This Snail?"": The first two-parter of the season shows incredible emotion and promise. Gary runs away from SB's house upon realization that his owner does not want him anymore, being too occupied with trying to beat the ""Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Paddle Ball Challenge"" and forgetting to feed his poor starving snail. Gary runs off to the streets of another city, where he is adopted by an elderly lady. She appears to be kind at first, having experience around snails, but Gary soon discovers a shocking secret about her and her past pets. Very emotional, and contained some (surprisingly) funny statements by Patrick. - 8/10
""Skill Crane"": Back to lackluster episodes. Mr. Krabs attempts to makes money off of unsuspecting suckers by setting up a claw vending machine. SB wins on every try, but Squidward becomes addicted and wastes his money on the game after repeated failures. After a training session with SB, Squidward finally wins, but his inflated ego gets him into trouble. Again, Squidward sympathy. Also, SB acts very perky and somewhat gay in this episode, a trend that would continue later into the season. Not very good at all. - 5/10
""Good Neighbors"": Squidward is planning to relax on Sunday, but his day off is ruined by SB and Patrick, who claim to be part of the ""Good Neighbor Lodge"", an organization dedicated to protecting Squidward from danger. Eventually, Squidward installs a security system to keep the two out, but it backfires and destroys the city. Unrealistic plotline, more sympathy towards Squidward, and SB and Patrick being as annoying as ever makes for one of the absolute low points in the series. - 2/10
""Selling Out"": Mr. Krabs sells the Krusty Krab to soulless businessman Howard Blandy, who converts the establishment into the Krabby O'Mondays. Krabs seeks this as an opportunity to retire and seek out other goals in life, but soon realizes how boring his life is outside the KK. After noticing that the Krabby O'Mondays is now hiring, he becomes the busboy, but soon realizes what the manager, Carl, has done to his employees and restaurant, and now must call off the deal with Blandy before it is too late. An improvement, and provides some witty and hilarious social commentary on the fast food industry (""Mr. Blandy! Code Red! Free thinker!""). - 7.5/10
""Funny Pants"": SB's laughter is getting on Squidward's nerves, so the cranky neighbor warns him that he will burn out his ""laugh box"" if he laughs at all within the next 24 hours. SB buries himself and awakens the next morning, only to find that he has lost his laugh. Lame and unfunny. Also, since when was Sandy a scientist? - 3/10

Disc 2
""Dunces and Dragons"": Another two-partner casting the characters into the roles of Medieval citizens. SB and Patrick are transported to Medieval times and must save King Krabs' daughter from the evil wizard Planktonomor. Somewhat overhyped, but definitely sees more adult humor coming into the picture. - 6/10
""Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy VI: The Motion Picture"": SB and Patrick are initially excited that a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy feature film is being produced; however, the film is using actors as opposed to the real thing. The two then meet up with their friends and attempt to film a movie starring the elderly duo, but this soon proves futile. Decent episode, although the real-life SB lips were kinda scary. At the time, I thought this was the worst MM&BB episode. However, season five proved me wrong, while season six proved to be even more horrific then that. - 7/10
""Enemy-In-Law"": Plankton falls head over heels for Mr. Krabs' elderly mother, and leaves his computer wife to pursue a romantic relationship. Upon realization that his mother and Plankton are dating, Mr. Krabs vows to do anything in his power to stop any further interactions between the two. Not by any means perfect, but contains some witty joke, such as the telephone and table gags. - 7/10
""Patrick Smartpants"": While jellyfishing, Patrick accidentally falls off a cliff and knocks the tip of his head off. SB recovers it, causing Patrick to become a genius. This new Patrick finds SB's recreational activities childish and immature, so he parts ways with his former friend; however, he soon finds out that friendship is more important then knowledge. Overrated, and a little stereotypical, such as Pat's British accent.
""SquidBob TentaclePants"": SpongeBob and Squidward are accidentally fused by Sandy's transporter machine, which makes working at the Krusty Krab a problem for the two. To make matters worse, Squidward has a clarinet recital by the next day. Sandy promises later in the evening before the recital that she will have them back to normal with her new invention before the recital begins. However, she does not show up during Squidward's gig, forcing him to hide SB under his cloak for the show. Very creepy for children (and even a little creepy for me, especially the ending) and not very funny or entertaining at all. - 5/10
""Krusty Towers"": Mr. K. converts the KK into a hotel. SB and Squidward become hotel service, which proves to be too tough for the latter, prompting him to quit. He then returns posing as a traveler, and ceases this as an opportunity to abuse Mr. K. and SB. One of my favorites of the season, although the ending was a little stupid and didn't make much sense. - 9.5/10
""Mrs. Puff, You're Fired"": Mrs. Puff is fired by the boating school superintendent for not being able to teach SB. A new, more unorthodox teacher (Robin Sachs; ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"") is hired, who, after several months of practice, manages to teach SB to drive. However, when the boating test finally comes, his methods prove not to be entirely effective. You know what to expect. - 6.9/10
""Ghost Host"": The Flying Dutchman stays in SpongeBob's pineapple to haunt him after his ship becomes wrecked. However, his pranks become tiresome after a while. The FD is convinced that he no longer can scare anyone, but SB attempts to help him regain his mojo by taking him on a scaring spree across Bikini Bottom. Gross and not that great for me. Also, despite seeing him several times previously in the series, Squidward pulls some ""I don't believe in ghosts"" crap. - 5/10
""Wishing You Well"": Mr. Krabs builds a wishing well to increase profits. Passable. - 6/10",1261958400,,7960,4.818713450292398
2594618,1,B000FZETKM,Seasons 1-3 of Spongebob were entertaining to children and adults.  Season 4 is just painful to get through.  Spongebob's new voice is very irritating.  Half of the fun was listening to Spongebob and seeing what he did with his voice.  Those days are gone.  I actually like when Spongebob is not around now because his voice is so terrible. Idiotic plots that are completely boring are all too present.  It's unfortunate that this has happened to such a great series.,1258502400,4,467,4.775

2594634,2,B000FZETKM,"I have been a huge fan of spongebob for a while and have bought all the seasons in DVD, including season 4 volume 1.  The change in spongebob is drastic: animation is different, spongebob's voice has changed when there was nothing wrong with it, and patrick seems to be more critical of spongebob and less ""dumb"".  The only characters that I don't notice a change is Mr. Krabs, Plankton and Squidward.  I love spongebob but I recently sold my copy of season 4 and don't plan to continue my collection after season 3...very disappointing :(.",1181260800,9,540,4.663157894736842

It's still Spongebob.",1178928000,3,349,4.948275862068965
2594637,4,B000FZETKM,"The fourth season kind of grows on me; I mean this is the season were fans were split right down the middle--one side saying that season isn't very good while the other side embraced this season.

I seem to fall into the latter camp here. The first season started branching the humor of SpongeBob; The second season, for my money, is the best season with no duds whatsoever; And the third season, while still good, did contain some weak points, most notably the half-hour episodes starring the annoying Patchy the Pirate. So on the whole, I'd say that the fourth season is at least as good as the third season. While my sister hates this season (with the exception of Dunces and Dragons), I seem to always look forward to another episode of SpongeBob.

Here are my thoughts on all 18 (including two half-hour episodes) presented in this set:

Fear Of A Krabby Patty: SpongeBob is overworked and starts seeing his favorite sandwich everywhere he goes, and searches a psychiatrist. This is yet another one of Plankton's attempts to steal the KB secret formula. A nice way to start the season, but could've been better in some aspects. 6/10

Shell Of a Man: An average episode involving a naked Krabs molted out of his shell and disguising SpongeBob with the shell for him to attend an old sailor reunion in order to hide his embarrassment. 5/10

The Lost Mattress: In probably the worst episode in this set, SpongeBob and Patrick buy Krabs a new mattress to help the old crab's back, and have sent his old mattress--where Krabs keeps his money--to the dump. 3/10

Krabs vs. Plankton: Better than the previous one, but still average. Plankton, in another attempt to steal the KB formula, slips on a wet floor and brings Krabs to court for not having a ""wet floor"" sign. 5/10

Have You Seen This Snail?: After a weak start, here's where things really pick up to speed. SpongeBob was too busy trying a certain record with his new paddle ball, and Gary, seeing his master carrying too much about his new toy and not feeding him, runs away, and is later picked up by an overtreating old lady. A sweet episode, by and large. 8/10

Skill Crane: One of my favorites from this set, Krabs orders a new crane game and Squidward is trying so desperately to win a prize from that game. A simple plot, yes, but still a lot of fun. 9/10

Good Neighbor: SpongeBob and Patrick ruin Squidward's day...again. The first half seemed pretty slow, but the second half, where Squidward buys a security system really makes up for it. 7/10

Selling Out: Krabs sells his restaurant to a corporate industry, and with his newfound fortune goes into retirement. After a while, things get boring, and Krabs finds a job at the new Krabby O' Monday's. Another fun installment. 7.5/10

Funny Pants: An entire episode focused on SpongBob's little laugh. Squidward, getting sick of the sponge's giggling, tells SpongeBob that he is going to burn out his ""laugh box"" if he doesn't stop laughing. 8/10

Dunces and Dragons: The only episode my sister liked from this season, which is basically all the SpongeBob characters in the medieval times. 8/10

Enemy-In-Law: Plankton is fed up with his computer wife and shuts her down. Then he falls in love with...Krabs's mother? Sounds disturbing, yes, but still funny, nonetheless. Plus I like Mama Krabs's new voice. 7.5/10

Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy VI--The Motion Picture: Not the best MM&BB episode, but still a great take on the stupidity of Hollywood remakes of superheroes we know and love. SpongeBob is plenty ticked that a new MM&BB movie is starring actors and not the real superheroes, and puts together a film crew to make a ""real"" film starring the old heroes themselves. 8/10

Patrick Smartpants: Another one of my favorites, and probably the highlight of this set. Patrick falls off a cliff and the top of his coney head is detached. SpongeBob puts Patrick's head back in, causing Patrick to become smart. 10/10

SquidBob Tentaclepants: It may just be my dark sense of humor calling, but this is another one of my favorites. In a freak accident with Sandy's new invention, SpongeBob's body is mixed with Squidward's, and only Sandy can seperate the two before Squidward's big night at the clarinet recital. Some of the edgiest and most bizarre gags the SpongeBob crew had ever pulled off. 9.5/10

Krusty Towers: Another one of my favorites, Krabs turns his restaurant into a new hotel, and Squidward, sick of serving guests under the golden rule ""We shall never deny the guests even the most ridiculous request"", quits his job and rents a room to give Krabs the most ridiculous requests possible. 10/10

Mrs. Puff, You're Fired: Mrs. Puff is fired by her own boss, and now SpongeBob is given a new and more militant driving instructor. I...don't think there's much to be said about this episode...it's good? 6.5/10

Ghost Host: There's that dark sense of humor again. In another one of my favorites, The Flying Dutchman's ship breaks down and all the green ghost has left is to spend time at SpongeBob's place until his ship is repaired. The Dutchman keeps scaring SpongeBob from time to time until SpongeBob finally says that he's seen all the ghost's tricks and the green ghost himself loses his confidence in scaring people. 9/10

Wishing You Well: My last favorite of this set. This episode ends this set with a bang, because it has almost every element that made SpongeBob successful: nonsensical humor, stupid Patrick, and goofy musical numbers. All of which is tied around a simple plot--Krabs building a wishing well--and carries one of the funniest live-action endings in a SB episode, alongside the first season episode, ""Suds"". 10/10

Well, that's it. I'm one of the few people that seems pretty confused to say why did they release a whole half of a season instead of just waiting for Nick to finish the season run and release the whole thing on DVD. Oh well, at least I can look forward to Volume 2...",1172534400,6,5936,4.754863813229572

The other sets deliver a solid 3-4 hours of material, these clock in sigiificantly less.  Most of the discs feel taken up with the tv 'specials' ""Dunces and Dragons"" and ""Where's Gary"".  I really wish they had made season 4 a single box instead of releasing it in volumes...",1167868800,7,527,4.494736842105263
2594652,4,B000FZETKM,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this season, although containing a few excellent episodes, is weaker than the previous three.  The cool wittiness that appeals to adults, like myself, is just not there.  Some of the story lines seem stale or, if they have possibilities, don't really go anywhere.  There are a handful of episodes from the previous seasons I do not like but, on this DVD, there are only a handful I consider stellar (""Have You Seen This Snail?,"" ""Enemy-In-Law,"" ""Patrick Smartpants""), the rest either OK, mediocre, or far below average. Fortunately, most of the better ones are towards the end so that may bode well for the second volume from season 4.  As much as I like SpongeBob, I cannot give this season five stars.  Here's what you get:

Disc 1:

""Fear of a Krabby Patty"":  To compete with the Chum Bucket, Mr. Krabs changes the Krusty Krab hours to 24 hours a day.  By day 43, SpongeBob starts to hallucinate about giant krabby patties.  Enter psychiatrist Dr. Peter Lankton (guess who he is). Pretty good idea but I found the ending to be rather stale.

""Shell of a Man"":  Mr. Krabs plans to go to his Navy reunion and reunite with his shipmates who remember him as ""Iron-abs Krabs,"" but Krabs has molted out of his shell.  To save his boss from humiliation, SpongeBob poses in his molted shell.

""The Lost Mattress"":  Finally, some other characters get involved!  An old, lumpy mattress causes Mr. Krabs back pain.  SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward buy him a new mattress and dispose of the old one.  One problem:  all of Krabs's money was in the old one!  Again, a good idea, but the humor was surprisingly bland.  Includes some not-too-subtle social commentary on the medical industry.

""Krabs vs. Plankton"":  Plankton slips on the Krusty Krab floor and decides to sue for negligence.  What he wants, of course, is the krabby patty secret formula.

""Have You Seen This Snail?"":  Two-parter which, thankfully, does not include the Patchy the Pirate fillers that were part of the original broadcast.  A paddleball contest distracts SpongeBob from feeding Gary the snail, so Gary runs away and finds an owner who goes to the opposite extreme.  This episode is wittier than the others so far.  Gary tying the bib around his neck for dinner is so cute!  Patrick's side remarks are also a plus.  This one is more like earlier SpongeBob episodes.  Other clever details:  Granny's ""killer stereo system"" and the clap on/clap off lights.

""Skill Crane"":  Mr. Krabs gets a machine that has a crane that picks up toys. Of course, SpongeBob wins on every quarter but Squidward, who can never win, becomes addicted.

""Good Neighbors"":  Squidward's relaxing Sunday turns out to be anything but thanks to a certain couple of neighbors.

""Selling Out"":  In song, Mr. Krabs admits he would trade his own daughter for riches.  It stands to reason, then, that he'd sell the Krusty Krab to a ruthless takeover chain Krabby O'Mondays.  When Krabs sees what's been done to his restaurant, he change his mind, but is it too late?

""Funny Pants"":  To stop SpongeBob's incessant laughter, Squidward warns him he is in danger of burning out his laugh box (SpongeBob's response: ""Is that what happened to you, Squidward?"").

Disc 2:

""Dunces and Dragons"":  Another two-parter.  It's not as good as the first one; in fact, I think it is overdone.  SpongeBob and company take on the roles of Medieval characters.

""Mermaidman and Barnacleboy VI: The motion Picture"":  To protest a MM & BB movie that uses actors in place of their heroes, SpongeBob gathers his friends to film their own version starring the real MM & BB.  The Sandy ""Did somebody say `boom'?"" gag is really run into the ground.  It ended very abruptly.  We see unhappy faces in the audience (of so-called MM & BB super fans) but no reaction that would be expected.  Very stale and more silly than funny.

""Enemy-In-Law"":  Fed up with his computer wife, Plankton falls in love with a lady crab who happens to be Mr. Krabs's mother.  This is an excellent episode.  Very funny and witty.  I like the line: ""Roses are red, violets are blue, world domination has nothing on you.""

""Patrick Smartpants"":  This is a very clever episode.  Patrick jumps off a cliff and knocks the tip of his head off.  Once SpongeBob finds and replaces it, Patrick becomes a genius.  More intellectually mature than his absorbent and yellow and porous friend, Patrick no longer wishes to see him.  He soon finds out that friendship is more important than his new found super-intelligence.  Who knows, if he had stayed on his intellectual path, Patrick might have found the cure to some underwater disease.  Alas, Bikini Bottom will never know.

""SquidBob Tentacle Pants"":  It's the day before Squidward's clarinet recital (now, how did he manage to swing such a gig?) but Sandy's transforming machine metamorphosizes Squidward and SongeBob together. At times, this episode is a little creepy. I like when Sqiidward comes out in the gothic robe and an audience member admits she's scared.  As another reviewer pointed out, this does remind one of the Treehouse of Horror episode where Bart morphs with a fly.

""Krusty Towers"":  By the title, I thought this would be a Fawlty Towers take-off.  Alas, it does not go in that direction.  Mr. Krabs converts the Krusty Krab into a hotel where any ""ridiculous request"" is granted (and, of course, charged).  Squidward quits so he can become a customer and takes their slogan to the extreme.  We get to see Squidward's mom!  Squidward requests cookies like his mother makes them, so Krabs and SpongeBob kidnap Squidward's mother.  When Squidward concedes that the cookies are just like his mother makes them, he adds, ""too bad she wasn't a better cook.""

""Mrs. Puff, You're Fired"":  Is SpongeBob un-teachable or is Mrs. Puff to blame for his endless boating test failings?  Watch this episodes to find out.  You may be surprised (or not).

""Ghost Host"":  The Flying Dutchman's ship broke down near SpongeBob's house (some witty scenes in this one, especially when the FD falls through the basketball hoop) so he decides to stay in SpongeBob's pineapple to haunt him.  When SpongeBob grows board with his guest's pranks, the FD thinks he is ""a ghost of his former self."" SpongeBob thinks he should try scaring the one who doesn't believe in ghosts: Squidward.

""Wishing You Well"":  Mr. Krabs starts a new sideline by having his own wishing well built.  Too much singing in this one.",1158624000,25,6475,4.828467153284672
2594653,4,B000FZETKM,"There are often times, the cartoons can be so funny, they can be just outrageous. For Nickelodeon, they've made it a constant where the animation has not just been oriented toward kids, but also to adults as well. That has happened with Jimmy Neutron, The Fairly Oddparents, and especially Spongebob Squarepants. Since his debut began in 1999, Spongebob has been recognized as the most popular cartoon character ever in years. But, many have longed for a new crop of episodes of Spongebob shows for the past few years, while the people behind the show were conjuring up the Spongebob movie. Now, new great shows have made it to home video.

Spongebob Squarepants Season 4, Volume 1 is a double disc compilation of great cartoons that've shown that even with Spongebob's absence from new cartoons, the cartoon hadn't lost its appeal. The shows here are just as funny as they were from the previous season, and deliver each with promise and delightful humor. The compilation includes so many great episodes including Funny Pants, where Spongebob loses his ability to laugh, after Squidward told him he would break his laugh box, but Spongebob was still able to laugh, Shell Of A Man, which Mr. Krabs is invited to his sailors' reunion, but he molts his shell, and Spongebob has to impersonate Mr. Krabs, and make himself as krabs as possible, and the unique episode Dunces And Dragons, which is a clever twist on the Mark Twain classic A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court. This one is my favorite on this DVD set, because it was just funny, and really delivered as if Spongebob and Patrick exhisted during the middle ages.

All in all, I just wished that there could have been more episodes of Spongebob on this DVD set, such as current episodes like Whale Of A Birthday and Wishing You Well, which are currently airing on Nickelodeon, but will be on the new volume definitely. Still, if you don't have cable and you enjoy Spongebob Squarepants, than this is a perfect DVD set for you or for any die hard Spongebob fan.

2594655,3,B000FZETKM,"The first three seasons of Spongebob were great. It was an absurd masterpeice of the highest order that made Ren and Stimpy look like ""Washington Week in Review"" in comparison. It had comedy that kids could relate to as well as something for us adults, mainly in the characters that resemble people we see in real life every day: the eternal optimist (Spongebob), the psychotic best friend (Patrick), the ""foreigner"" just trying to adapt to new surroundings (Sandy), the ""accomplished neophyte"" that lacks any real skill (Squidward), and the cheapskate (Mr. Krabs).

Unfortunately, in its fourth season, Spongebob jumps the shark, probably due to the departure of creator and marine biologist Stephen Hillenburg. The cartoon inhabitants of Bikini Bottom have become just exaggerated caricatures of their past incarnations - they are cartoons of cartoons. The clever dialogue and straightforward storylines of past seasons have been replaced with slap-stick physical comedy and overly complex storylines that are boring for children and too inane for adults.

So why, you might ask, am I giving it three stars? Because it still has its moments. In particular, I really loved ""Patrick Smartpants"" which was nothing short of a series classic. Patrick and Sponge Bob are jellyfishing when Patrick runs off a cliff and loses his head, which Sponge Bob (accidentally) replaces with brain coral. Patrick then becomes a genius, discussing classical music with Squidward and complex physics and calculus with Sandy. I also liked the half hour episode, ""Have You Seen This Snail? (Where's Gary?)"" in which SpongeBob tries to beat a paddle-ball world record and forgets to feed Gary -- for 10 days. Gary runs away to downtown Bikini Bottom where he is taken in by a kindly old woman who indulges him in every way possible. This is fine with Gary until he finds out why he is being fattened up, and promptly returns home to a lonely and penitent SpongeBob.

There were other good episodes, but the bad episodes are pretty awful. For example, I found myself just plain bored with ""Dunces and Dragons"", in which Spongebob and Patrick get transported to medieval times, and the season openers ""Fear of A Krabby Patty"" and ""Shell of a Man"" were so bad they were just plain embarrassing to watch. Also, although this show has always had some mild adult humor built into it, mainly in the form of witty dialogue, the episode ""SquidBob TentaclePants"" is way too scary for small children. It is very much like the 80's version of ""The Fly"" - where SpongeBob and Squidward get spliced together in Sandy's transporter machine. The results of these animated Frankenstein-like mixtures might be funny to adults, but I can see it inducing nightmares in small children. Graphic horror is just not what you expect when you tune in to SpongeBob.

All in all, I think these first twenty episodes of season four form a ""take it or leave it"" kind of season, which is just not how I would have ever expected to describe any season of SpongeBob.",1154995200,71,3012,4.946640316205533
