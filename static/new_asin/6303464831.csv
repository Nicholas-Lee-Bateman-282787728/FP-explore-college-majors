655500,5,6303464831,"I have to confess.....I love this movie. I think I've watched it over 300  times, and I'll probably watch it another 300.
Say what you want to  about Meg Ryan being too cute, about the plot being predictable, whatever.  I think it's just....jivin'. It's a neat love story, about the actions of  boy meets girl, fate and love, and Albert Einstien's convertible.  Throw in  a comet and a few wacky physicists, well, it's just pure fun. I wish to  heck I could find the score somewhere; the blend of do-wap and Mozart is as  much fun as the movie itself.
I'm prejudiced because Tim Robbins is my  favorite actor, but all the acting in this goofy, off the wall film is  top-notch. Though it's not one of the late Walter Matthau's most famous  roles, I personally think it's one of his best, and I can't think of anyone  better to play the eccentric Albert Einstien.
One of the most beautiful  things about this film is the accuracy of the set and costumes. Not just  Meg Ryan's picture-perfect 50's dresses, but the buildings and vehicles,  and especially the heavily wood-panelled bungalows favored by the rich  during the late 50's; they're so time-perfect you can almost smell the  Lemon Pledge.
Incedentally...look for one of the funniest performances in  one of the experiments by Meg Ryan's movie fiance, ""Excremental  Psychologist"" James Moreland. I'm not sure who the actor is, but in  the background of his lab is a student driven psychotic by a ""time  depravation experiment"", and his physical humor and antics are about a  thousand times better than anything from SNL in the past decade.
By the  by, this makes a perfect date movie, and is mild enough for kids...but  still fun for adults. It's just all around terrific, and a great buy.",965260800,14,1744,4.717607973421927
655501,5,6303464831,"This is a movie I love to watch over and over again.  The humor is great,  and the acting is very well done, especially the part of Einstein.  It is  an excellent family film, and well worth seeing.",958953600,2,198,4.131578947368421

655685,3,6303464831,"This is an almost criminal waste of a good cast: Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins, Walter Matthau, Stephen Fry, Charles Durning, Tony Shaloub.... The concept of Einstein as matchmaker is compelling fun, but the script is awful and the direction of acting talent stinks. Maybe the script makes interesting characters impossible, but it is discouraging seeing a group of actors who individually have shown moments of brilliance in other roles delivering here as if they're phoning it in. This is really a two or two and a half star film, but I'm pushing it up to three stars because it's nice to imagine what this group could have done with a good script and more rehearsal. So...three stars to the casting director.",1518652800,,703,4.818181818181818

A light-hearted love story but with a nice twist, the whole experiment context between Albert Einstein and his cronies. His niece was played well by a young Meg Ryan. Tim Robbins was great in this in an understated way, very handsome here. Walter Matthau was the perfect Einstein. I could watch it again a few times more over the years. What I would call delightful... and heartwarming. Many I'm sure would not dream of giving this movie 4 or 5 stars...,but it just has so many nice moments, and especially fun between Einstein and his cronies.

656092,4,6303464831,"This was okay, it was a bit slow at times, Einstein's posy of old intelligent but socially awkward scientists were the higlight of the film, especially when they're cheating and trying to tell Ed the answers while he's undertaking an intelligence test in front of a full lecture theatre.  Meg Ryan's character is the object of affection for a mechanic (Tim Robbins) who when returning something she left at his garage learns she is the niece of Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau in a wig).  Albert doesn't like his niece's current fiance and encourages the mechanic to try and win her, but insists she only likes smart men because she believes it will give her really intelligent kids, so Einstein and his posy decide to talk up the mechanic's intelligence and pretend he has come up with a way to nuclear power NASA spaceships.

656175,4,6303464831,"It is a sweet, cute movie with enough funny stuff in it....but it bothers me that the time period is not pinned down better.  This is ironic since much of the conversation is about whether time exists or  not.  Her hair and outfits could have walked out of the mall yesterday.  It was no where close to how she should have looked, even if she was supposed to be a nerd.  This bugs me more than it would most people because I was old enough at the time Ike was in office to know what the styles were.  In fact, the only thing that pinned it down was that Pres Eisenhower was a character.  Meanwhile, the vehicles seemed to be mostly out of place time-wise as well.  Matthau did a wonderful job as Einstein, and his make-up job was superb.  It was a treat to see Tony Shalhoub as the guy running a garage and working on cars, when I loved watching him as Monk for so many years.  It was surprising that my husband sorta enjoyed it..

657789,3,6303464831,Generally fun. Some good lines.  Matthau makes a great Einstein but it's difficult to swallow Meg Ryan as a brainiac,1454889600,,116,4.8
657790,4,6303464831,"This is a light-hearted romantic comedy that is amusing to watch mostly due to Tim Robbins performance and the antics of the Einstein Cohorts!  The plot is a fictionalized version of Albert Einstein and his famous physics compatriots living in Princeton, along with his niece, Catherine Boyd, who did not exist in real life.

Walter Matthau is endearingly funny as the very old Albert Einstein, who lapses into German and has a crazy head of hair.  The only weakness in his strong intellectual faculties, is the love for his niece, Catherine, and his belief that his niece is marrying the wrong man, who will turn her into a hausfrau (housewife) and make her unhappy.

Meg Ryan is Catherine Boyd, the geeky but very pretty niece of Einstein, whose brainiac head is filled with so many math equations, that practical matters escape her.  Her thoughts race faster than her mouth can voice them.  Meg is young and pretty enough to carry this off, but she is still the same Meg Ryan as in all her roles.  A cute tilt of her head, a pert toss of her hair, quizzical expressions, a comic grin, a lip curling in derision, speaking girlishly fast, giggling like a teenager, and flouncing off, are her stock in trade.  It is her startling blonde beauty that has carried her off to Hollywood and numerous films, and this is the only thing she has to offer.  If she were not so pretty or so blonde, she may have had to learn to act to get parts and would have not had it so easy to get roles opposite major male stars.

Stephen Fry is very droll as the stuffy English Psychology professor and fiance of Catherine, who does experiments on rats genitals and primates.  Stephen is variously known as Monkey Lips, The Chimp Pimp, The Excremental Professor, The Rat Man, and The Rodent King!  He plays a nice foil with his bookish knowledge to Tim Robbins street savvy mechanic character, and showing a jealous mean streak as the jilted boyfriend when his attempts to win Catherine back are foiled.

Tim Robbins is the love-struck blue collar mechanic Ed Walters who is suddenly thrust into intellectual circles far beyond his level of education, due to his attraction to Einsteins blonde niece.  Fortuitously it turns out that he is endowed with a higher than average intelligence which explains his voracious appetite for science articles and his genius with the mechanics of motor cars.  He befriends Einstein by giving him a joy ride on his motorcycle, and is commissioned to chop off the top of Alberts car to create a convertible.  This allows him access to Blondie, and a romance begins.  Ed Walters has emotional intelligence known as EQ, and this is complements Catherine Boyds IQ or rational intelligence.  They are almost two pieces of the same puzzle.

There is humor in the juxtaposition of Eds coworkers and boss versus Alberts physicist friends.  The era is 1950s, cars are big, women wear skirts, men are gentlemen, and romance hangs in the air.  There was one major mistake made in the film.  Ed Walters imitated Marlon Brando as The Godfather, to make Catherine Boyd smile.  The Godfather role played by Marlon Brando premiered in 1972.  Albert Einstein died in April 1955.  This made me wince and feel very manipulated by the movie.  Such an obvious error discredits the entire film.  Come on!  Dont make chimps of us all.

If Meg Ryan has been a better actress and carried her part, this would have been a good film. She is the only female shown, and the film revolves around her character.  Sadly, she was not, and Megs head tosses and insouciance make you want to smack her into a reality check!

However, this is light entertainment, and it succeeds on this level as the humor created by Tony Shalhoub (Eds mechanic boss in the garage), Tim Robbins, Walter Matthau, and the rest of the cast make you chuckle and warms up a cold night.  Good for relaxing with the family or picking up your spirits after a tiring day.",1454803200,9,3923,4.673469387755102
657791,2,6303464831,"There are some cute scenes, but not many. She is too adle-brained for my liking. The story also supports pursuing a woman that is already engaged. I just can't get behind that.",1454803200,,176,4.53125

I sometimes tire of Walter Matthau in movies but he's so good here, surprisingly not hamming it up at all as Einstein. Nice message about enjoying life--and that having brains can be a big part of that (and smart people are -necessarily- humorless stuffed shirts!) One of my favorite photos of Einstein is that one of him at Princeton, riding a bicycle--so human, a genius, and so joyful.

All of a sudden, Catherine and Ed are on a boat and she says, ""I love you.""  Really?  The ""love"" comes out of nowhere because the writers didn't give enough attention to the story line to make the story believable.  Then, the James character (Catherine's fiance) is left hanging in the plot.  No real reaction to this betrayal.  The story line once again leaves you without a believable ending.  The fight Catherine and Ed have in front of the President of the United States is silly and unbelievable.  This movie had a lot of potential--it has great actors in it--but the plot/story line needed a lot of work.  Catherine's insecurities seem out of place and unnecessary given the overall theme of the movie.  She doesn't seem insecure as much as she seems unfulfilled.  The difference is in the development (or lack thereof) of her character.

Tim Robbins plays a auto mechanic who loves reading science magazines who falls for a girl played by Meg Ryan who is a math whiz. Little does Ed Walters, Robbins, know but Catherine happens to be the niece of Albert Einstein. Einstein is played by Walter Matthau who is perfect for the roll. Other then putting a wig on him there wasn't much they had to do to make up Matthau to look like Einstein. Einstein decides to take some time off along with some of his friends from physics to try and help Walters start a romance between him and Catherine. Problem is she is already engaged to another man and ... well you know how romance comedies like these work out. The formula for the plot is nothing new but this is still enjoyable to watch. It is because of the performances of Ryan, Robbins and Matthau that make this so enjoyable.

658541,4,6303464831,I enjoy all the characters in this movie.  It's just a light hearted easy on the eyes and ears movie.,1403222400,,101,4.05
658542,5,6303464831,"With a small but solid cast, headed up by Walter Matheau as Albert Einstein, this love story mixes just the right amount of humor, angst, science (science can be sexy you know) and the chemistry of love to create a fusion of wonderful proportions.  Einstein's niece, played by the beautiful and talented Meg Ryan, is torn between her brain and her heart (the former she has trouble giving free reign to and the latter she remains clueless about) and the movie takes us to resolution.  A garage mechanic, played brilliantly by Tim Robbins, is smitten by the (already engaged) niece.  Fortunately his love of science leads to a relationship with Einstein, and the game is afoot.

Einstein and his three cohorts (brilliant, but clueless men) set out to help turn Robbins into a physicist that his niece will fall for.  It is all so wonderfully done, and the gaffs and guffaws are interwoven to make you laugh, and then smile at the love story neatly tucked in between.  This is not a just a ""chick flick"" but a well-conceived story of relationships--of how smart smart really is...

It is amazing that with no guns, sex (Meg is in period 1950's dressing BUT still looks stunning though), fight scenes, cursing, or any of the other all too common movie fare, they have put together a truly wonderful story of science, friends, love, and human caring.

Probably should be required watching at all film schools for budding writers and directors...  A big thumbs up from BOTH of us here in this house.  Wahoooo!",1403049600,,1504,4.727969348659004

This eloquent production proves that we don't have to watch sex, listen to profanity or lower our standards while watching a movie. Meg played her part as a brilliant yet goofy blonde and Tim Robbins played the ""in love"" role with every bit of his being. Tim was so in tune with his part that even his body language was perfect. Then we have Einstein played by Walter Matthau and it's the best characterization of his career even though he was overlooked for Best Supporting Actor. From the moment his character spoke I never once thought of him as Walter or acting or as anything or anyone but Einstein! Even if you saw this movie in the 1990's, watch it again.

This is an excellent romance, with the Einstein relationship adding some quirky fun. The acting, directing and writing of this 1994 film are all top notch. I would rate it personally as a classic. There's something in it for guys and gals. This feature runs 100 minutes and was directed by Fred Schepisi. IMDB estimates the budget was $25 million and that the film grossed $26.3. million domestically. Could somebody please ask Meg to make some more movies?",1392595200,,815,4.956204379562044

659456,5,6303464831,"I've loved this movie since... well longer than I care to admit. This sort of true family romantic comedy is now completely relegated to the sphere of TV movies and it's a darn shame. Everything about this movie works, a great cast, a charming script, and polished production values that bring 1950's New Jersey to life. The plot admittedly is a bit farfetched, but it caters to the dreamers in most people.

I've always found Albert Einstein to be an enigma, even with the entire libraries could be filled with the books written about him, I find it doubtful any of them shine light on who the private man was. There have been suggestions that he had a mild form of autism, or Asperger's syndrome. The movie doesn't add these theories into it's characterization of Einstein, but he's at times appropriately absent minded. I'm not keen on Walter Matthau in general, he made a career of grumpy, unsympathetic characters, whom I never warmed up to. But I will say this, I can think of any other actor who could've played Einstein as naturally as Mr. Matthau did. Not once do you catch him acting. Not even the great Spenser Tracy who played Thomas Edison to perfection could have done what Matthau did with this role.

Of course, he didn't do it alone... His three cronies Kurt Godel (played by Lou Jacobi) Boris Podolsky (played by Gene Saks) and Nathan Liebknecht (played by Joseph Maher) make this movie sparkle! They're accents, perfection, their mannerisms, impeccable, and the chemistry, outstanding! They always convince me that time doesn't exist, which is good because I hate wearing watches.

I haven't forgotten that this is a love story, and as such the leading man and leading lady shouldn't be forgotten. I've always wondered why Tim Robbins doesn't (or didn't) do more of these films. Possibly, he just didn't like the scripts or the typical leading man role in these rom-coms just bored him. It is a shame though, he's just so warm and darned likable in this. Okay, he's not the traditional hunk of a leading man, but he personifies ""attractive"" here. I love that he, (like Mr. Matthau) is completely natural. Sincerity is the most important quality in a good actor and he had it here in spades.

This film was made at the height of Meg Ryan's rule of the box office as America's Sweetheart. She defined the quintessential ""milk and apple pie, girl-next-door"" and while Catherine Boyd might be a babbling math genius who loses things quite easily, she is also milk and apple pie. The role is what Ms. Ryan excels at and she did her thing.

Another thing I love about this movie is how beautiful it is. I'd love to have the wardrobe, I love the cars, the buildings, everything is just lovely without feeling staged and pretentious. This movie is set in the 50's, and it captures everything this current generation views the 50's as, in a genuine way. Kudos.

Of course, this is a great movie just for star watching as so many bit parts are done by big names now. Stephen Fry, as the clinical psychologist fiance standing between true love. Tony Shalhoub, as Ed's boss. Charles Durning, as Catherine's boss. And the most scarily accurate portrayal of President Eisenhower I have ever seen done, is by Mr. Keene Curtis, WOW!

659555,4,6303464831,"Set in the 1950s, this lighthearted and quaint little romantic comedy is an ideal medium for it's cast. The theme is not unique, but the mechanisms, from the truly brilliant young mathematician to the ardent and sincere young mechanic to the overbearing and woefully socially inept fianc are perfectly synergistic. The only flaw, if it could be considered a flaw in a romantic comedy that simply MUST have a happy ending, is that it is unerringly possible, from the first 5 minutes of the film, to realize that the sparkling personality of the mathematical genius, so excited about her life and her studies is a completely inauspicious fit for the staid, self-centered, and completely romantically inept Professor to whom she is engaged... from there, it is unquestioned that the fantasy life of such a person could not POSSIBLY proceed further without the intervention of love where it is, at least for her, completely unexpected. While it is certainly formulaic, it is also adorable and enjoyable, and enthralling, and I hope that you will take the time to enjoy this light and vivacious movie.",1378944000,,1096,4.994535519125683

And love is the compass that can keep you on the right road in the right direction towards the right destination that you may never reach because distance is like duration: it is unfathomable and infinite.

Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins play two unlikely star-crossed lovers. Robbins is an auto mechanic and Ryan is the grand-niece of Albert Einstein. This warm romantic comedy is just plain fun. Einstein helps Robbins present a paper on physics, and Ryan gradually realizes that she is in love.

The story is simple and silly but I think what saves the movie and makes it so appealing to so many people is the straightforward, unapologetic attitude of the director.

While one of the major elements of the plot is quite far-fetched - that is, fooling everyone into believing that an auto mechanic is a nuclear physicist - the story is so well executed by all of the members of the cast that it works perfectly. The result is a light-hearted comedy with the anomaly of Albert Einstein (!) as a major player in the action.

Garage mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) falls in love at first sight with Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), but he doesn't yet know how he can possibly win her away from the ""lesser professor,"" James Moreland (Stephen Fry), to whom she is already engaged. Serendipity comes into play when Catherine accidentally leaves her watch at the garage; Ed goes to her address to return it to her and finds out that she lives with her uncle, Albert Einstein (played to gleeful perfection by Walter Matthau). Einstein and his cronies (also played with joy and verve by several co-stars) provide the vast majority of the laughs as they set about to make sure that Catherine doesn't resign herself to a drab life with the ""chimp pimp"" but instead falls in love with vibrant Ed.

There is not a bad performance in this film, the 1950's are recreated with a great sense of nostalgia, and the scenery is beautiful as well (New Jersey lives up to its `Garden State' nickname in this one). The movie is rated PG for ""Some mild language,"" but there are fewer profanities than you can count on one hand (and these truly are mild); I dislike profanity in movies, but I must admit that I can't even recall exactly when in the movie any of the instances of it occurred in this one.

Set in the late fifties, the story begins when Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) and her fiance James (Stephen Fry) experience car trouble while riding around in his MG, and seek assistance at a garage. The garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), sees Catherine and falls hopelessly in love with her. Of course, Ed's aspirations seem to be hopeless. Ed is a very good car mechanic but has no formal college education. But in the spirit of all romantic comedies, Ed feels that the relationship has a chance if he can only meet her and spend some time with her.

When she accidentally leaves her pocket watch at the gas station, he seizes the opportunity to try and see her again by personally returning the watch. Imagine his surprise, when he knocks on the door and Albert Einstein answers.

Surprisingly, Ed and Professor Einstein hit it off immediately. Ed is no scientific genius, but he understands human nature and the importance of having fun in life, two things that Einstein feels are lacking in his niece's life, which has been largely based on trying to emulate her uncle. Einstein is getting on in years and wants to make sure that she is happy and will be looked after properly. When Ed expresses the depth of his feeling, Einstein vows to help set things up. Einstein and his physicist friends -who also dote on Catherine-, decide to try and set Ed and Catherine up as a favor to both of them. It turns out that the car mechanic pretends to be an amateur physicist to impress Meg Ryan. Ed -allegedly- develops a process to use cold fusion to power a spacecraft, which during the cold war and the space-race was extremely important. However, this process didn't exist, Catherine finds out that Ed is a fraud and Ed realizes that he must level with her if they are ever to have a true relationship. The clever and romantic ways that these issues are resolved by Einstein and his cronies and by Ed and Catherine themselves make up the remainder of the story.

The highlight of I.Q. has to be the performance of Walter Matthau as Einstein. He has created an original character that seems totally different from the kind of roles he always played with Jack Lemmon.

Ed and Catherine are engaging as the young lovers and give us good on-screen chemistry, like they were meant for each other.

While this film is by nature light and predictable, you will find it quite enjoyable entertainment.

One of my favorite lines from the movie is in a dialogue between Albert Einstein and Tim Robbins' character Ed. They are discussing how to get Catherine to go out with Ed since Catherine will only go out with intellectual types.

Einstein: ""The problem is she would never go out with a guy like you.""

Ed: ""Well that's easy. Lend me your brain for a while.""

Einstein: ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?""

Ed: ""Now what are the odds of that happening?""",1119657600,6,3056,4.630314232902033
659957,5,6303464831,"This movie will grow on you if you like the sweet romantic comedy.

The cast is great.  Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) the Garage Mechanic falls in love at first sight of Catherine(Meg Ryan) when she appears at his Gas Station with a failing car with her  pretentious fiance James Mooreland (Stephen Fry).  Ed decides to go ask her out and appears at her home and knocks on the door.  The door opens and there is Albert Einstein(Walter Matthau) ""You're Albert Einstien!""  ""Zank you"" and thus begins the plot to break up the engagment and bring Ed and Catherine together.

The subcharacters are great!  Especially Einstein's pals played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks, and Joseph Maher.  ""Three of the greatest minds and together they can't change a light bulb.""

All in all a great warm funny film!  Matthau again has to mentioned as his performance was brilliant.  He should have been nominated IMHO.  You can't go wrong with this one.",1112227200,3,924,4.735849056603773
659988,3,6303464831,"Walter Matthau, as Einstein, easily steals the show as he tries to persuade his niece to ditch the brilliant, boring, scientific nerd she's engaged to and follow her heart, which is tugging in the direction of the local auto mechanic, who has taken one look at her over the hood of her disabled car and fallen ridiculously and madly in love.

Even Meg Ryan has trouble with the costuming of the 1950's era: cinched waists, twin sets, white gloves (!!), etc., and I got the feeling she was just going thru the motions of playing Meg Ryan, as only she can.

Cute, but very lightweight.",1105315200,17,583,4.542857142857143
659989,4,6303464831,"Apart from a quote I love (""I'd rather be an optimist and a fool, than a pessimist and always right"") the movie is also a  relatively intelligent feel-good romantic comedy. Matthau is hilarious as Einstein, almost looks like him too! Robbins is at his suave best, and Meg a prim intellectually inclined neice of Einstein.
If you have any respect for the history of physics and the reputations of the people who formed non-Euclidean theory, leave it at the door. (One cannot but wonder if fictional physicists, instead of real characters could not have accomplished the same thing in terms of compelling characterizations?)
In any case, the movie is a neat little love story, and worth a cosy evening's rental.",1066521600,4,709,4.908333333333333
659990,4,6303464831,"I caught this flick on cable TV one day and was left feeling I watched a good-hearted romantic comedy. The movie wasn't the funniest or raunchiest and it wasn't a tear-jerker...just the way a romantic comedy should be. Robbins (the actor) was great in his ""working man"" role. The Einstein twist was marvelous and his (Einstein's) fellow genius' were also great.
Strongly recommended for someone looking to watch a romantic comedy free of zany characters or crazy scenes.",1064102400,8,470,5.038461538461538
659991,4,6303464831,"I've always quite loved this movie.  All the main actors shine and create believable nutty characters.  The plot, while given an Einstein twist, is pretty standard charming romantic comedy fare.
The DVD solely features a widescreen Dolby 5.1 version of the film, and doesn't even bother including a theatrical trailer.  It's not a cult hit, so it's not terribly unexpected that great love wasn't lavished upon the DVD production.  My one complaint would be that the video transfer was evidently done from a used print.  This is particularly evident during the title cards, where the primary colors used for the background show fairly clearly the various flecks of dirt or hair that you'd expect to see on a film print.  This is not the end of the world, and I am overjoyed to have this movie on DVD.  But the video transfer would have been fantastic (it really is sharp) without these occasional dirty print issues.
All in all, I'm glad to add this movie to my DVD collection, and I would happily recommend this movie to anyone else interested in romantic comedies.",1063843200,4,1065,4.786885245901639

helps that the uncle is Albert Einstein) Just a great clean
flick. I loved it. Tim looks so young, innocent and wide-eyed. These are my favorite roles for him. My husband likes him as
