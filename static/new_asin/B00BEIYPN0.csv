5586467,3,B00BEIYPN0,"A kid, gets caught up in a slick outfit with dubious morals. Ends out in big trouble and has to struggle to get out of the mess. It probably would have been a lot more believable if it had been drugs or something like that.

The acting was good. I did like Ben Affleck performance. I think Gemma Arterton is an incredible good looking woman.

5586468,3,B00BEIYPN0,"Ritchie (Justin Timberlake) is a student at Princeton. He goes on line and gambles away his tuition money, and afterwards realizes that unlicensed off shore on line gambling web sites are dishonest. GOSH! Richie gathers the statistical evidence and travels to paradise to meet up with Ivan Block (Ben Affleck) the owner of the web site. Block recognizes Richie's genius and invites him in for a big slice of the pie. Richie recruits some of his nerd friends to help him out. About 30 minutes into the story the FBI (Anthony Mackie) confronts Richie and wants him to be an informant...or else he can never go back to New Jersey and maybe New York. Richie is faced with a dilemma of being super rich in paradise with Ivan's girlfriend Gemma Arterton clinging to him or Newark. Oh what to do, what to do.

No one plays for free.

The film is mostly a light action drama. Timberlake and Affleck looked good on the screen and tried to give some life to a tired script but only succeeded in appearing unconvincing in their roles, especially Affleck. The dialog had some good lines, but needed more. It wasn't a film that I could get into. I couldn't help think about ""21"" which is a far better gambling film.

When you play against a computer designed to take your money, it isn't gambling.

Works as a rental.

5586469,3,B00BEIYPN0,"Justin Timberlake is the best well-rounded entertainer in the world.  Love him or hate him, he's the closest thing to this generation's version of Michael Jackson.  Odds are, you have some kind of firm opinion of his music, and regardless of that opinion he's still a massive moneymaking machine.  His fans are loyal and no doubt enthusiastic about his recent return to music, but the gap between his albums is due largely to his ambition to become a serious actor.  Even though Timberlake is no Jamie Foxx, he's still a relatively accomplished actor - starring several memorable roles, including The Social Network, Friends with Benefits, and In Time.  Obvious, some of his films are better than others, but he still appears to improve from role to role, forcing many people to wonder if his future is in movies or music.  In any event, Timberlake is back with yet another flick, starring opposite Ben Affleck, in the drama, Runner Runner.

Directed by Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer), Runner Runner stars Justin Timberlake as Richie Furst, a bright young Princeton student that turns to online gaming to help pay the bills for his expensive tuition.  In the process of attempting to win money in an online poker game, he discovers he's being cheated by one of the world's most lucrative gambling websites.  Furst makes his way to Costa Rica, where the site's owner, Ivan Block (Ben Affleck), runs the site.  Impressed with his ambition, Block hires Furst to bring in new clientele and make some serious money.  However, Furst is quickly approached by an FBI agent named Shavers (Anthony Mackie), telling him that if he continues down a dark path of working for Block, he will be banned from returning to the United States.  And, to make matters worse, Block appears to have a hidden agenda and secret plans of his own for Furst.  Gemma Arterton and John Heard also star in supporting roles.

To be honest, Runner Runner is not a bad film - it's simply an outdated film that would have been far more successful if it was released in the 1990s.  This film features a plot that is so painfully repetitive that not even George Clooney, Brad Pitt, or Robert Downey Jr. could save it from a trajectory of failure.  Easily comparable to films like Paranoia, 21, and Rounders, Runner Runner's plot can't be considered as anything other than generic.  Very little about this story is fresh, and it suffers mightily from the same predictability of similar films - which is perfectly evident with the recent release of Paranoia, which was unsurprisingly ignored by moviegoers.  The plot goes something like this...  A blurry-eyed main character sees the forbidden fruit dangling from a tree branch, grabs it, and takes a bit - unaware that it's nothing more than poison.  Quickly, the character realizes he's a puppet in someone else's ""game,"" and must do their bidding until he's able to figure a way out of a dire predicament.

Sadly, this is far from Justin Timberlake's best work.  He portrays a smart guy from Princeton that basically has all the necessary tools an individual needs to be successful, but instead, he is easily fooled and essentially bought off with the promise of fortune.  In a perfect world, Timberlake's character would have most likely taken his knowledge of fraud to the police, which would have given him 15 minutes of fame, followed by all sorts of potential employment opportunities.  However, his character takes a patsy's job working for a blacklisted man of stature - who basically only has days until he's busted by some sort of law enforcement division.  As they say, ""there's a sucker born every minute,"" and in this particular case, it's Timberlake's character, not to mention Justin Timberlake himself for taking such a two dimensional role.

While Timberlake flounders about with a poorly constructed character, Ben Affleck easily outshines his co-star, playing the calculating villain, Ivan Block.  Affleck's character is just about as interesting as Timberlake's, but at least Affleck gives this film a bit of mystery and class.  To say Affleck is a pleasure to watch is a bit redundant at this point, but it's impossible not to appreciate his impressive run in acting - which does also include his role in Runner Runner.  His recent work in Argo and The Town has been some of the most enjoyable roles of his career, and unless you live under a rock - you've probably heard he's going to be the next Batman.  Still, Affleck is a bit of an ambitious choice for a playboy villain, but he's surprising effective in this role, which should give some doubters a great deal of hope for his potential as playboy billionaire, Bruce Wayne.  Regardless, it's absolutely no surprise that Affleck owns this film, and as well he should.  He's an acclaimed actor in a role that he's probably too miniscule for him at this point in his career.

Overall, Runner Runner simply suffers from the over abuse of a tired story.  The characters could have used an overhaul to at least make them appear a bit more compelling, but in the end, there's nothing about this film that isn't offered by network television.  Justin Timberlake should have stayed in the music studio instead of taking this role, while Ben Affleck shortchanged himself by playing second fiddle to a former member of `N SYNC.  However, despite the enormous shortcomings, this lackluster thriller (which forgot to bring the thrills) manages to pass as an acceptable means of entertainment - clocking in at a mere 90 minutes.  For Timberlake or Affleck fans, this film will be acceptable, but for anyone looking for a meaningful plot or ambitious film, feel free to wait until you've exhausted your choices to watch this expendable feature.

5586470,3,B00BEIYPN0,"Director Brad Furman, who directed the excellent ""Lincoln Lawyer"" left me feeling a bit disappointed. Maybe it was his casting choices; I'm not sure. This is an R-rated flick about gambling and as we know, ""the house"" always wins.

We watch:
  * Ben Affleck (""Argo"") as Ivan Block, a sly offshore entrepreneur who runs ""the house."" He is charming and ruthless. He has two hobbies: sailing his yacht and feeding his pet alligators.
  * Justin Timberlake (""Trouble With the Curve"") is Richie Furst, a clever on-line gambler who spots some cheating on Block's website. He knows a gambler who owns ""the house"" has no need to cheat, so tracks down Block to let him know one of his employees has tweaked the program.
  * Gemma Arterton (""Quantum of Solace"") is set decoration for most of this 91-minute crime drama, although she does play a key role...eventually...
  * Anthony Mackie (""Pain and Gain"") is FBI Agent Shavers, an ambitious but frustrated fellow who has no jurisdiction on the Caribbean island where most of the action takes place.
  * John Heard (Lots of TV) is our hero's father, an inveterate gambler who becomes a pawn in Block's chess game.

This one had me (almost) covering my eyes as foreshadowing threatened to become reality. Expect lots of profanity, some gunfire and fisticuffs but no blowie uppie stuff. In my opinion, Timberlake will have to keep looking for a vehicle that will make him look good....

Your DVD from Amazon will clarify some of the plot because you can turn on the captions.",1380758400,,1513,4.795366795366795

Runner, Runner starts with online gambling, and then turns into a run-of-the-mill thriller with an uninteresting hero and even more uninteresting romantic interest.

An ethically shady young college boy gets the offer of a lifetime when hes employed by a big shot casino owner. Richie (Justin Timberlake) soon discovers that in order to become the worlds biggest douchebag he must first learn from the master (Ben Affleck).

What did I think?

This film presents itself as a very clever mathematical thriller stirring memories of The Bank (2001) but every time theres a clever bit they skip ahead to the bikini girls and the brooding ex-pop star. If you threw James Bond into this film it would be a great Bond Film but thats because you'd be watching James Bond.

Timberlake puts in a solid performance but the pacing is slightly off and the romance unconvincing. Ben Affleck never manages to come across as villainous. He gives the impression that hes about to wink at the camera and then run off and high five Kevin Smith.

You won't be bored in the process of this film failing to make a lasting impact.",1403913600,,958,4.578947368421052
5587520,2,B00BEIYPN0,"""Runner Runner"" is a lame attempt to make a thriller from the ignominious fate of certain online poker rooms during the poker boom of the last decade, namely the now-defunct ""Ultimate Bet"", where site owners cheated players at the tables and absconded with money from their accounts. Ritchie Furst (Justin Timberlake) is working on his master's degree at Princeton University after a short, ill-fated career on Wall Street. When the university threatens to expel him for earning his tuition by driving customers to the online casino Midnight Black, he decides to try his hand at the site's poker tables. As he spins his $17,782 up to $50,000, Ritchie suspects that one of his opponents can see his cards. Reassured by a statistician that the player in question is playing far outside of statistical norms, Ritchie takes his complaint directly to the site's mysterious owner Ivan Block (Ben Affleck) in Costa Rica. Bizarrely, Block responds by offering Ritchie a marketing job with a seven-figure salary.

Ben Affleck was among those cheated at ""Ultimate Bet"", so it's fitting to see him in a movie inspired by that story. ""Runner Runner"" has interesting source material, but the script is painfully bad, and the plot does not make sense at any point. I have no idea why a university would care that one of its students is an affiliate for an online poker room. I'm not aware that any university ever did. A 20-something young man claims that a trip to Costa Rica is his ""last chance in the world."" A rogue FBI agent (Anthony Mackie) blackmails Ritchie by threatening some charges that could not possibly exist. Nor could he have any jurisdiction over Ivan Block, no matter how much money the man stole  -as we all know from the ""Ultimate Bet"" case. I don't know why Block would need to bribe the Costa Rican Gaming Commissioner (Yul Vazquez) or why anyone would care. Or why Block throws people to crocodiles. Most of the conversations seem to have no purpose. No redeeming features.",1403740800,,1983,4.846607669616519

Any movie that can incorporate the visual lushness of Costa Rica is going to be striking. A major negative was the casting of Gemma Atherton, giving another ""I'll just show up, look pretty, and fake my way through the lines"" performance.

5587838,3,B00BEIYPN0,"I thought it was kind of generic, but it was still interesting to watch. I think Justin Timberlake was miscast here, though at least it wasn't Joseph Gordon Levitt. Timberlake plays a college student and online gambler named Richie who gets swindled out of his college tuition by a gambling website and goes down to Costa Rica to confront the billionaire owner Ivan Brock. When Brock sees him as an asset, he offers him a job, but Brock is involved in all kinds of illegal activity and now Richie is caught in the middle of it, with Internal Affairs on his case.

Timberlake seems miscast in the role and comes off both too meek and unbelievable in the role. Gemma Arterton contributes almost nothing to the movie as Brock's girlfriend and con-woman Rebecca. While Ben Affleck, playing a villain, ironically makes him more likable here. Its when he tries to be a nice guy, or even worse a ""meek"" or ""nerdy"" guy does Affleck fail epicly. But he works well as Ivan Brock and is more believable as a bad guy (probably because I think Ben Affleck's too smug and perfect to play likable roles or heroes).

The plot is a little predictable, but the end was nice. ""Runner Runner"" was nothing spectacular, but if you see it on cable or Netflix one weekend evening, its worth watching until it gets dark and your friends arrive to your place go out for the night. Its a ""time-killer"" movie. Not horrible, but not that memorable. I wouldn't suggest paying money for it, but its watchable.",1397174400,,1478,4.59469696969697

Morale of the story (in my opinion) is that college is a legalized criminal organization that ruins lives with debt, oppressive and meaningless workloads, etc. while promising those same lives a guaranteed future in society.  JUST LIKE the organized crime venture that almost kills Timberlake's character.  Keep it in mind, kids.

The acting is great.  Really is.  Affleck is a great villain.  The story is easy to relate to and entertaining, but it is not groundbreaking.

5587894,2,B00BEIYPN0,"After all is said and done, once you have seen the story of someone (normally a young new star or starlet) character who has been duped or ""whatever"" into a life connected to something illegal (this particular film focuses on online gambling with Timberlake being the dupee and a heavier Affleck being the duper), you basically have seen them all. In summary this rendition of this hackneyed storyline shows no creativity on any front. For example, using alligators (or crocs) to threaten/devour the bad guys was much better done in Romancing the Stone.

The storyline is as above - drab.

The writing of the screenplay uses almost verbatim dialogue from earlier films following the same premise. After all, how many such stories can be going on at the same time?

It seems to me that Central and South American countries probably have movie company crews who go from one of these mirrored flics to the next. I suppose that the biggest fail would be when there are more than one such company making such a tired film that individual crew members become over-booked and must miss out on working on the next film with the next set of actors doing the same thing!

Whereas franchise films/stories at least try to keep the hype going for the audience between the first to the ad nauseam edition, producers, writers, directors and ""actors""  who repeat stories such as this film blatantly does, don't even have the decency to let the youthful audience know that, as they reach into your pocket to steal away with your hard-earned cash, you will eventually see this thing again and again in the future.

At least when a real actor makes a summer movie (as in a movie that makes no pretensions to originality), to make some coin the film does not make the audience try to rationalize away why they paid for a ticket in the first place.

Let me put it this way, when you see a film with Ben Affleck associated with it of late, just remember that churning out pretentious work will be the norm. I remain hopeful that he will some day show the props he did in Good Will Hunting.

5588167,2,B00BEIYPN0,"In the Eighties, legend has it, the US armed forces hit upon the idea of encouraging Hollywood to make recruitment films for them. Thus, An Officer and a Gentleman, Top Gun, Navy SEALS and Private Benjamin (okay: maybe not Private Benjamin) were bankrolled by Uncle Sam specifically to make the military look glamorous so impressionable minds might sign up. As far as my mates were concerned it had the desired effect. Since we were slap bang in the middle of Nowheresville, South Pacific, they enlisted not for the Top Gun program but as RNZAF cadets and wound up clanking around the Chatham Islands in a forty-year-old Hercules. As far as I know they're still doing it now. As a consequence, to this day none of them can abide Val Kilmer. But no matter.

Latterly this military recruitment tactic seemed to have fallen out of favour, but it might be back: Ben Afflecks new movie Runner Runner plays so moralistically as a lecture against the evils of online gaming you have to wonder whether FBIs Cybercrime Fraud folk didn't have a stake  excuse the pun.

Subtext: online gaming can corrupt innocent and brilliant minds all too easily.

In Runner Runner, the possessor of said innocent and brilliant mind is a chap whom we note, with some irony, made his name corrupting them: Justin Timberlake. His character is Ted, or Fred, or Jack  not 20 minutes after the credits rolled I honestly cant remember  a wily Princeton brainbox, already in penury for inciting games of chance amongst his college buddies, and about to get in a bit deeper when he starts mixing it with Mr Big on a Carribean Island.

Oddly, Timberlake has transmogrified himself from jailbait sex magnet into a faintly oatmealish actor (if Affleck is Theodore Logan, Timberlake is William S. Preston all over) whose only remaining mystery is how he ever passed for a sex symbol, even to a twelve year old, in the first place.

Affleck here plays the more charismatic part of dastardly e-Casino magnate Ivan Block. Still, this is a dramatic return to form for an unremarkable actor who has, of late, been doing a fine impression of having more to him than ever used to meet the eye.

Unltimately, Runner Runner is simply a paint-by-numbers Overcoming the Monster yarn with a strange title. It relies for its glamour on the absurd contrivance that people who set up online gaming companies in places like Costa Rica actually go out there and live in Bachanalian Xanadus, humping scores of prostitutes and throwing hapless local thugs to crocodiles. Heres the news, folks: the only people who make money in tax havens by actually living there do so by preparing board resolutions. No crocodiles.

In this alternative universe (the same one inhabited by Tom Cruises The Firm, incidentally) there is therefore an exotic locale for Oatey Justin to voyage to, and armed henchmen, dopey customs officials, sharp-dressed undercover Feds and foxes by the armful to kick the meagre plot along. Gemma Arterton plays a budget Bond girl who seems to have been sprayed with Ronseal fencing stain.

Duly kicked, Runner Runner certainly canters along. It is not blighted by continuity errors, dialogue howlers or the dull and awkward moments that beset the comparable but inferior Savages. It isn't a bad night out, but its short a car chase or two to be a decent actioner (charging round a carpark with a handycam is no substitute), and is missing a sandwich or two from the picnic hamper if its trying to make a political point.

Routine.

5588174,1,B00BEIYPN0,"I've seen a couple of positive reviews for this movie, including advice to watch it for yourself. All I can say is: ignore that. Those people don't care about you or your happiness.

I'd say this movie is mediocre at best and more like a student film than anything else with a predictable plot line and bizarrely awful dialogue. By ""bizarrely awful"" I mean that I don't understand how anyone who read the script would give it the 'go-ahead' must less such well-known and, in many circles, highly respected individuals without editing...any of it. But if you want to watch Ben blink excessively and guys sit around talking while several girls awkwardly pet them during conversations and arguments, maybe this is the movie for you. I had some confusion over a few plot holes, but the unintentionally hilarious dialogue pretty much drove away any concern over that.

You're supposed to care about the characters (or, at the very least, the main character), but after watching it the only thing I really cared about was the fact that I spent money to see it when I really wish I hadn't.",1393632000,2,1082,4.71957671957672

Affleck was a cartoonish villain and Timberlake didn't pull off the mathametical wizard who used his talents to game online gambling sites.

The movie moved too quickly into the plot without enough setup to understand the motivations of the characters and without explaining, for example, how Timberlake's character was so easily given an intvitaiton to the big party while others were rejected.

5588606,1,B00BEIYPN0,Ben Affleck is an okay actor but Justin Timberlake did not seem to have worked on his delivery on many lines in this movie. This type of role was too much for him and he might be suited to less challenging roles. Didn't hold my attention at all.,1390953600,,245,4.125

The only reason it did not earn 5 stars from me is because I felt the personal relationship between the stars (Justin Timberlake and Gemma Arterton) could have been developed quite a bit further, resulting a little more richness to the entire experience.

5588804,3,B00BEIYPN0,"Not horrible but not great either. Tried to be an Ocean's Eleven type movie where the twist comes through at the end but by that point you're fairly detached from the storyline anyway. Ben Affleck has a decent performance, if not a bit forced. Similar personality type to his Boiler Room character (which he does extremely well). Justin Timberlake was decent but I think he's more suited to comedy. I may have been too distracted by the mash up of actual online poker real world headlines. They basically combined a few different actual event story lines  to form this narrative which, while it works ok, can be tough to swallow if you are in tune with the reality of online poker during the last 10 years.",1390262400,,706,4.603174603174603

5588809,3,B00BEIYPN0,I watched this strictly for Ben and Justin and was not disappointed with not to high expectation to start. Storyline and flow a little choppy but for the most part enjoyable.,1390262400,,174,4.645161290322581
5588810,1,B00BEIYPN0,Aweful movie. Timberlake should never act again. His soft dameaner renders it impossible for him to play a character with any street credit or edge what-so-ever. Not even worth watching when sick with the flu and nothing else is on.,1390262400,,232,4.825

5588895,3,B00BEIYPN0,"As I was watching the movie I got the impression I had seen this before.  It reminded me of the 1987 movie Wall Street with Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen.  One could draw an easy parallel between Gordon Gecko and Ivan Block.  The sinister mentor of Bud Fox and/or Ritchie Furst.  The both come up with a strategy to get in front of the bad guy, they both get a girl who belongs to the bad guy, they both engage with the FBI and screw the bad guy...anyway, I was liking the movie right up until the point I realized, ""hey wait a minute!  I've seen this plot before!""  I gave it a 3 because it was still a pretty good movie.  If you've never seen Wall Street, rent Runner Runner.  If you have...I'm sorry I ruined it for you. :)",1390262400,,730,4.127659574468085

The plot was weak... and I love me some Justin Timberlake but acting just isn't one of his fortes. Ben Affleck was eh... same with the leading lading. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but my advice would be to exhaust any other viable movie options first.,1390176000,,412,4.363636363636363

I know everyone likes Justin on SNL and some small parts in movies, but his true lack of acting colors show through in this one. The only thing he convinced me of is that he was bored making this movie. And Affleck could be playing a nice guy, bad guy, cop, tough guy, lawyer, tranny, who knows because he seems to read those lines like it's the first time he's ever seen them. The story was not bad and will make for a good movie someday when they remake this with some actors, but for now watch something else.

5588943,5,B00BEIYPN0,"It was better than I thought.  JT was pretty good, he needs to thank Cameron Diaz for the acting lessons.  Ben was good too and took me back to Boiler Room Movie and I equally wanted to kick his ass in this movie.  A Christian Bale he is not.  Batman he is not!

The only thing I didn't like was that the movie takes place in Costa Rica and JT and Ben were getting a hard on of some white chick with a pretty smile and some brains with nothing on top or in the back, she was a seven at best.  Hello did you forget you are in Costa Rica and you are millionaires!  The curvy tanned Costa Rican women did nothing to you 2 white boys?  In a movie that was showcasing life in excess, all of a sudden plain Jane was the lust object?  not believable.

Not much interaction with the locals, the food, the culture, beach... nothing.  Didn't notice Costa Rica, it felt more like they were in Vegas with an Ocean's 12 kinda feel.

It's kinda like Timberlake, Affleck, and Dicaprio (Leonardo who was a producer) just got together to spend some money and have a class project.",1389830400,,374,4.267605633802817
5588958,4,B00BEIYPN0,"I enjoyed this movie because of the stars who were cast in leading roles and despite a somewhat choppy script.

The strongest part of the movie for me was Ben Affleck. He has become so accomplished as an actor. He gave an exceptional performance throughout the film in my opinion. Justin Timberlake did a credible job and I like his handling of the character as a whole but I felt like his character suffered the most from the less-than perfect script and the timid directing of the film as a whole.

Together, Affleck and Timberlake made the movie an enjoyable experience. I recommend it and I'd like to see more from this duo.",1389830400,,628,4.548672566371682

5589349,3,B00BEIYPN0,"Director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer, The Take) and writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien (Walking Tall, Ocean's 13, Runaway Jury) have energy to burn but somehow got sidetracked by this predictable, ill-focused little exploration in the current obsession with online gambling and tried to make it work by assembling a very strong cast whose efforts are basically wasted here.

Princeton grad student Richie Furst (Justin Timberlake) is making a killing by coaching Princeton students in online gambling until he is discovered by the administration of the university and ordered to cease and desist. At one last attempt to make enough money to pay his Princeton tuition he loses big time, and believing he's been swindled, travels to Costa Rica to confront online gambling tycoon Ivan Block (Ben Affleck). Richie is seduced by Block's promise of immense wealth, until he learns the disturbing truth about his benefactor. When the FBI (Anthony Mackie) tries to coerce Richie to help bring down Block, Richie faces his biggest gamble ever: attempting to outmaneuver the two forces closing in on him. Sidebars include some dangerous interplay with Block's accomplice cum paramour Rebecca (Gemma Arterton) and Furst, and the involvement of Furst's longtime failed gambling father (John Heard), and a host of bad guys who like to fight.

The script is clumsy, ill prepared and uncomfortably delivered (understandably) by Timberlake, Affleck, Mackie, and Arterton. About the only emotional response for the viewer is one of shack and awe the gambling has such a purchase on Internet obsessed people. Who knew?

If you want to support the choice between iTunes Digital Copy and UltraViolet, vote with your dollars and boycott any combo packs from 20th Century Fox that are like this one where you look on the back of the slip cover and there's only one arrow and it says ""DigitalHD - Works With UltraViolet"" and nothing else.

The story is as improbable as ""monkeys flying out of my butt"". Now, I like monkeys and I am not sure if my rear end could actually accommodate something like that.... well highly improbable.

Timberlake gets cheated online out of his tuition money and manages to get into the inner circle of the mega rich tycoon.. (see what I mean).

The actors are good, not just proficient. But the lack of a coherent movie idea makes this barely watchable.  If you like these types of star vehicles, watch it. Otherwise, watch the subtitled version of ""Amores Perros""",1388275200,,795,4.91044776119403

5589566,4,B00BEIYPN0,"For my money, Justin Timberlake only works well as an actor on Saturday Night Live, and even then he is quickly grating, relying heavily on recurring characters. ""The Social Network"" being perhaps the sole exception where he showed some acting chops, it's not hard to understand why Ben Affleck wipes the floor with JT in ""Runner Runner,"" figuratively and almost literally.

In need of money to support his brainiac skills at Princeton, JT angles himself into a lucrative job for Affleck's online gaming kingpin in Costa Rica. What makes the film work is that the filmmakers don't skimp on making sure the details feel and sound right, and allowing Affleck to infect every scene with a smarm that warns you as it seduces you.  It's as if Affleck's character in ""Boiler Room"" has been resurrected and given a prominent upgrade this go round, and this film is all the better for it. The film is never as good when Affleck isn't on screen, so much so, you're never fully certain if JT is going to survive the entire film, and in one scene involving sea creatures, you're all but certain he won't.

This film will never move past being a B-list genre movie or bro-tastic cult fave, so few are likely to see one of Affleck's best performances, and certainly his loosest.  It reminds us that, once upon a time before the fame, this was the next big actor.  Maybe he's better off directing, but I'd pay to see more of this kind of Affleck swagger on screen.",1387929600,,1450,4.604651162790698
