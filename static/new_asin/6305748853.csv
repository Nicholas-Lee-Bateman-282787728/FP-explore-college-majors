1069634,5,6305748853,"Excellent documentary on how dinosaurs may have actually lived and evolved throughout their respective time periods. Computer graphics mate seemlessly with actual environmental vistas to create a highly believable documentary  type film. Especially liked the part when the T-Rex sprays saliva on the  camera lense, giving a first person camera view perspective. Not only are  the lifestyles and behavior of the dinosaurs depicted in a believable  manner, but the theories behind the behavior is also explaned and is easily  understood by adults and children alike. Your kids (or the kid in you) will  enjoy this documentary.",955929600,11,624,5.447916666666667

1069640,5,6305748853,"I work for the Dinosaur Natural History Association in Brooks, Alberta.  We support Dinosaur Provincial Park.  Because of this I started receiving phone calls from the UK, from friends and family asking me if I had seen  ""Walking with Dinosaurs"".  Everyone was raving about it, however,  I had at this time no idea what they were talking about.  Luckily I was  sent a copy for Christmas and what can I say. This is one of the most  fascinating and incredible set of programs I have ever seen.  My mouth was  open in amazement most of the time!  The animation was beyond belief.  Basically ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is 6 part series made in  documentary fashion.  The producers worked with palaeontologists and  animators to take what we know about dinosaurs, with what we think we know  to come up with six incredible programs of a documentary style that would  make you believe you were actually walking with dinosaurs.  Narrated by  Kenneth Branagh in a way that you would expect to see on the Discovery  Channel while watching a documentary on a pride of lions.  My nine year old  daughter watched this too and was totally caught up in it.  Never have I  watched such an amazing creation.  The animation matches that of the  dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"".  The story lines are believable to  the point that you get emotionally involved with the Iguanodon herd risking  attack, or the Apatasaurus caught up in a forest fire trying to escape.  You want the T-Rex to 'get it' after the way she treats her man!  To top  it off at the end of the series there is a 50 minute ""Making of  Walking with Dinosaurs"" (at least there was on my copy, I hope you all  get it on the DVD)  Which leaves you with feelings of nothing but  admiration for Tim Haines's team, who worked hard at their research and  quest for fact, the conditions they had to create in their heads to film  landscape with no dinosaurs, from the footprints they had to make in sand  to trees swaying and splashing water... WATCH THIS! It is hysterically  funny in parts and you will be amazed.  If you watch no other movie or  series in your life .... watch this one because you will feel totally  fulfilled, amazed and be on the phone to your friends telling them about  it.  It is truly brilliant and you will want to watch  it all over again  immediately afterwards... I know I did!

1069641,5,6305748853,This is an impressive undertaking. To make a documentary about animals that disappeared 65 million years ago but give the impression that they were filmed 'live'.

We watched it with them when we visited last month and the kids had a ball. They were fascinated. There were even scenes where a parents had to eat their young to survive and the kids didn't bat an eye or seem at all disturbed by it. They're at the age where they're interested in animals, especially exotic lizards, and so the pacing and explanation of the different types of dinosaurs is perfect. It also is accurate in differentiating between the different periods (Jurassic, Triassic, etc), so the children learn the proper scientific names of specimens and have an understanding of when different animals existed.

1069804,3,6305748853,"This series had always intrigued me since it came out, but I had not seen it until the price on the DVDs came down and I purchased a copy.  However, upon watching the series I was a little disappointed.  The stories are very formulaic and predictable, portraying recurring themes, such as hunting, fighting and death. Each session shows only a small number of characters/dinosaurs rather than a prehistoric world teeming with all kinds of life. The imagery is good, taken from superb scenic locations, and allow for much of the narrative filler. Also, there seems to be an extreme amount of scientific guesswork and creative license throughout - which might be expected in a documentary of this nature.  Overall the production seems to fall a little flat and become boring. Perhaps in this era of special effects, I was expecting something a little more spectacular. Although the computer animation and animatronics are quite good, they don't seem to quite compare to what can be done in the entertainment industry and thus perhaps my less enthusiastic review.",1185753600,,1060,5.011363636363637

The problem with walking with dinosaurs is that in the first episode, it didn't show dinosaurs like the Eoraptar and the Herrosaurus.  There were only 2 species of dinosaur.  Coelophysis and the Plateosaurus (at the end).

1069897,5,6305748853,"Walking with Dinosaurs is the first of its kind, a programme that started the making of other dino-documentary films. A famous production of the BBC (and one of its best) made with the help of Framestore animation and animatronics from Crawley Creatures and Associates. So, how do they work? Lets see:

The documentary:

My favourite documentary film, the best film about prehistoric life (along with WwB, and the others). Many people complain that fiction overcomes fact. If the makers would have made WwD without any fictional stuff, there wouldn't be anything to make. IMO Star Wars is 100% fiction and we can still enjoy it. WwD is about 50% fiction. Why can't we enjoy it too? Yes, I admit there are scientifical flaws.

Animation:

Very realistic, beautifully animated animals can be seen throughout the series. Even at today's standards, the animation is good. But a few flaws can be spotted. I'll write some:

-In the scene when the Iguanodons are walking on the beach, some of them walk in the air. Their feet don't touch the ground. A few scenes later, when two young Iguanodons are running, they are also running about 10-20 cms abowe the ground.

-In Episode 4, in lots of scenes, the Pterosaurs' long fingers go through their wings. This can be clearly seen. This happenes about 30 times.

-In Episode 4, when the Utahraptors jump on the Iguanodon, the raptor's hand and head goes through the prey's shoulder, and one of the raptor's foot is on the Iguanodon's hind leg, but in the next frame it's on the front leg. Earlier at the 'unsuccesful hunt', the raptor's tail passes through the Iguanodn's.

-At the Ornithocheirus mating ground, some shadows are not right, and some Pterosaurs are actually transparent - you can see through them.

-In the forest, a young Diplodocus is drinking from a bush, not eating.

Yes, but they were done by people who can make mistakes...

Animatronics:

These puppets are also good looking (it would be quite nice to have some of them), and they ""blend in"" with the CG animation. And the goofs:

-The Koolasuchus doesn't open his mouth when he is attacking prey.

-In Episode 3, when the Ophthalmosaurus is giving birth, it is evident that the animatronic used in this scene is being damaged by the water - bits of ""skin"" are falling off, revealing whitish rubber underneath.

The sounds are awsome, the best dinosaur sounds I have heard. The music is also very good, even though I don't listen to music, the WwD music is one of my few favourites.

Now for the DVD.

Where I live, the DVD 'stinks'. The narration is poor, with LOTS of mistakes in the script. Luckily, the original narration is incluided so I can enjoy it. The DVD Extras are poor. With only the 'Making of...', it doesn't have much.

I could write the technical stuff, but I won't - mainly because I can't tell any.

So, despite the flaws, goofs, mistakes, dumb narration (not the English version, that one is really good) Walking with Dinosaurs is and will be my favourite film. A classic that shouldn't and can't be missed.",1134604800,4,3040,4.734345351043643

From the very first dinosaur to to the very last, the show explores the changes to the world and evolution of the dinosaurs to keep up.  Frankly, two of the shows don't even FOCUS on dinosaurs, but on the sea reptiles and the flying reptiles.  It could of used more dinosaurs.
There is a 50 minute ""Making Of"" documentary in the second disc and about 29 minutes of behind-the-scenes picture-in-picture footage spread through-out the first disc.  The behind-the-scenes footage tells you how they did the effects, why they picked certain locations and why they made the dinosaurs do what they did.  Some of the behind-the-scenes footage is also shown in the ""Making Of"", so there is some overlap.
Interesting, but much of the information was already well known and covered by older shows or children's books.  And, yes, lots of babies seem to die.  A lot. THAT is nature, but maybe not something younger viewers should be exposed to in so many scenes.",1083974400,2,1072,4.731182795698925
1070080,5,6305748853,"Walking with Dinosaur; is a SPECTACULAR movie featuring different kinds of dinosaurs.

The movie is broken down into a series of episodes featuring a different dinosaur in each one of them. The narrator, Mr. Kenneth Branagh (sorry if misspelled) did in excellent job and just added to the immersive story telling! I felt like a child listening to a wonderous bedtime story. I laughed at the funny parts and felt sad during the tragic parts of the stories. The movie is very long and is complimented with beautifully orchastrated classical music. The movie is about three hours long and I still wish it was longer; because that's how much I loved watching WWD! Adults and children will like it!

I have worked in the elearning world with programmers who make 3-D animations of industrial equipment, and I have to say I am just amazed at the quality of the work in this series.  The dinosaurs just plain look like they are alive today.  It looks as real as if they were shooting elephants in Africa.
PROS
* Presented in story style of real animal documentaries: Each of the six episodes follows a small number of dinosaurs for a period of time; we learn about their relationships with each other and their environmental struggles
* ""Making of"" bonus DVD is a treat for older viewers interested in seeing how the episodes were made. THERE WAS A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH PALEONTOLOGISTS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT ADDS TONS OF CREDIBILITY AND REALISM TO THE END PRODUCT.
* Animations as real (or better) than Jurassic Park
* Comprehensive focus on different periods (Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous) of the dinosaurs and wonderful background on the different climates and geology of these periods
PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION
Anyone, young or old, with an interest in dinosaurs should get this.  There may be some parts that frighten young viewers, so parents should screen it first and be with kids during the kids' first viewing.  BUT THIS IS PHENOMENALLY ENTERTAINING AND EDUCATIONAL FOR EVERYONE.",1072915200,6,1424,4.991561181434599
1070082,4,6305748853,"We bought this DVD for our 3 1/2 year old boy who is in the advanced stages of dinosaur obsession.  He is very interested in all the particulars of each dinosaur -- names, diet, chronology, habits, etc.  He was beside himself with delight when we first started watching the DVDs, literally jumping up and down yelling ""Coelophysis!  I love this!  Diplodocus!  Look, Allosaurus!""
As almost all others have mentioned, the overall production design is beyond impressive, and beggars the word ""clever.""  Witty, thoughtful, convincing, and highly entertaining.
Unfortunately (for us), there is one dramatic trope that appears in literally every episode of this and the later ""Walking With Prehistoric Beasts"" series:  eating babies.  Sometimes creatures eat their own young for murky defensive reasons; sometimes predators pick off defenseless baby prey; sometimes territorial males eat their competitors' babies; sometimes giant ants eat cute hatchlings.
I can't fault the dramatic effect of these passages, and the continuing theme that competition is the engine of evolution is accurate and effectively presented.  But it takes the air out of my little boy's enthusiasm when he constantly expects the cute baby dinosaurs to be messily devoured, and it makes me grimace to watch him watching it.  Those scenes are not especially suspenseful, and don't seem to agitate him (he got a lot more anxious at ""Finding Nemo"").  But when his reaction to two Allosaurus eating a baby Diplodocus is ""look, they're sharing!"", I decided the infanticide just wasn't age-appropriate.
We put the series aside for now, and maybe we'll take it up again in a year.",1072569600,57,1642,5.252873563218391
1070083,4,6305748853,"Walking with Dinosaurs is an interesting series for lovers of natural history. I have not seen the Discovery Channel version with Avery Brooks narrating, but only the DVD-version with Kenneth Branagh.
One should think that someone who does Shakespeare well should be able to get a dinosaur show done right, but it's obvious that dinosaurs are not Kenneth's passion, and both in WWD and Walking with Prehistoric Beasts one sometimes hears that he is reading a badly-rehearsed (and occasionally poorly-written) script. Sir David Attenborough with his authority and enthusiasm would have been perfect for the job, and I was a bit surprised that such a major BBC fronting didn't feature his legendary voice and employed his singular talent in writing nature show narrations.
That aside, I enjoyed it both visually and from the educational point of view, even if many elements of such a show naturally soon becomes dated as calculated guesses are disproved by more recent findings.",1069545600,2,976,5.1835443037974684

They love it so much, I'm buying the DVD to replace my poor worn-out tape of the Discovery airing.  The only thing that makes me sad, is the narrator.  Avery Brooks gave the narration a certain flair that, no offense to the man, I do not think Kenneth Branagh can.
  I've seen some really bad reviews of this program here, and i have to say, they are dead wrong.  Is ""Rancor"" high?  Hey, buddy, unless you lived there, you don't know anymore about the dinosaurs then anyone else.  Also, what the heck is this ""anit-reptile/bird, pro-mammal bias"" he's talking about?  The last time I checked, we were mammals and the dominant species.  Survival of the fittest, sir.  Besides, it was proven years ago that dinosaurs and birds were in no way related.  Put down the crack pipe and pick up a book.
  Anyway, this documentary is a must-have for anyone who has school-aged children or who just loves dinosaurs.  Take it from someone who falls into both catagories.",1068422400,4,1060,4.529100529100529

If they want to criticise the use of puppets, disputed claims, minor inaccuracies(disputed), excluded details...  (you get the point), I believe they have every right to do so.  All I can say is THANK GOD FOR THE BBC!!!  If the ""Experts"" had made this series we'd get to watch them argue over how the Diplodocus REALLY performed bodily functions!!  Let's face it, if they made this series showing the ""real"" day-in-the-life of a dinosaur, we'd all turn the channel (and certainly not buy the DVD) after watching them eat grass and leaves for 2 hours.  This series was designed to do 2 things:

1. ENTERTAIN YOU.
2. EDUCATE YOU (no, not you ""Vertibrate Paleontologist"", the average person).

Without 1, 2 does not happen.  That's the reallity of it. I learned more from this series (or ever needed to learn)about Dinosaurs than I'd ever imagined.  The details about Dinosaurs will always be disputed, but the fact that this series (DVD) is great educational entertainment can not.  I highly advise anyone who is not a Vertibrate Paleontologist to add this DVD to your collection. YOU will not be disappointed.

DISCLAIMER:
(Vertibrate Paleontologist have been known to enjoy this series from time to time.  They just get a little picky about Dinosaurs like it was their JOB!!)",1062115200,4,1429,4.924686192468619
1070086,5,6305748853,"The release of the movie ""Jurassic Park"" renewed the spark of interest in dinosaurs, and spawned several inferior copycats, documentaries, and two sequels of lesser quality. ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is one of these spin-offs into the world of dino movies and documentaries. However, ""Dinosaurs"" is exceptionally different from many of its cousins, and one only needs to watch it to realize why it was cable's highest rated program.
As was probably the case with many Americans, my first experience with this series was on the Discovery Channel. I taped the series when it next came on, but less than a month later, I bought the VHS set (this was before I had a DVD player). After watching what is essentially the original version of the series on VHS, I was left to wonder why I had wasted my time and a tape on the Discovery version!
The original version of ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" has scenes that were cut out of the Discovery version due to time and gore. The narration by Kenneth Branagh is top-notch, and it's clear he's working with a superior script compared to what Avery Brooks has to work with. This is best exemplified by the introduction to ""Cruel Sea"", where Branagh's narration leads us to believe that the dinosaur we are viewing is the ""top"" predator, giving us no clue he is speaking about a creature that is essentially ""Jaws on steriods"". I especially like how the writers handled the extinction of the dinosaurs - very convincing.
The animation for this series is excellent, portraying the animals in the Mesozoic world as real creatures. The only flaw in the series is the animatronic puppetry - there were only a few instances that I felt like I wasn't looking at a rubber puppet, and truthfully, that wasn't often. Other than that, it was like watching a National Geographic special or Wild Kingdom.
I also would like to recommend the two followups to this series - ""The Ballad of Big Al"", or ""Allosaurus"" as its more commonly referred, and ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"". If you can, get the DVDs. I sincerely hope that the creators will soon do a series on the amphibians and reptiles that appeared before the dinosaurs. I'll withhold comment on the upcoming ""Walking with Cavemen"".",1055289600,7,2211,4.805774278215223

Dinosaurs once again walk the earth in this groundbreaking documentary. Tim Haines has done something that had never been done before, breath life into a world vanished long ago. Unlike Spielberg, Harryhausen, Disney, or anyone else in Hollywood. Haines portrays dinosaurs not as cinematic monsters, but as living animals for the first time. With dazzling visual effects, incredible cinematography, moving musical score, and a powerful narration by Kenneth Branagh. This film could have easily been a theatrical release.

HOWEVER - they didn't.  Who says so, some nutty anti-evolutionists?
No.  Henry Gee says so.
And Henry Gee is a senior editor on ""Nature"", one of the most highly respected scientific journals in the world.  I quote:
`Viewers should have the right to expect that everything is true; or, if it isn't, they should be able to tell fact from fiction. This is not the case with Walking with dinosaurs' (Nature, 7 October 1999, 401, 530).
What we have here is NOT science but sci-fi.
Far from showing us how things were, the series depends upon a whole heap of imagination.  How did various creatures actually look, move, eat and otherwise behave?  We can guess, and depending on the completeness of various fossil skeletons we can make some educated guesses.
But ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" goes far beyond 'educated guesses' and gives us something that excels in the animation department, but which has been roundly criticised by numerous scientists for the extent to which it has passed off fantasy as fact.
So, did we worry how accurate the creatures were in ""Jurassic Park""?  I shouldn't think so.
And when viewers realise that this is also a largely PSEUDO-scientific production then I guess it can be enjoyed in much the same manner - as entertainment NOT as education.",1046390400,8,1460,4.796812749003984

1070165,4,6305748853,"Who cares whether the science is 100% accurate?! Paleontologists don't even agree on every detail. The point is to make these creatures come alive, and convey a sense of what life was like in those prehistoric days. This series succeeds admirably. You really get to feel that life was dog-eat-dog, perhaps no different then from today. Not only do strong dinosaurs eat weaker ones - they eat their own kind, even their own children and mates! Cruelty was everywhere, made necessary by the need to survive. But such was nature, and so it remains. Only very small children should not see these magnificent pictures. There's much philosophy in them. You learn about life itself.
The quality of the graphics is slightly below that of the first Jurassic Park, let alone the sequels.  But that's not too bad for a British production. This is an expensive production FOR A DOCUMENTARY.  The real bummer is the perfunctory treatment of the Alvarez K-2 event, i.e., the description of the meteor which destroyed the dinosaurs.  The graphics are poor, and the description brief to the point of neglect.  One is misled into thinking that the rock wiped out the dinosaurs overnight, when in reality the climatic change caused by it took decades, even centuries, to make the dinosaurs extinct.  (It also fails to mention that had it not been for this event, mammals would not have flourished, and we might not have existed.)

1070167,5,6305748853,"I purchased this title along with ""When Dinosaurs Roamed America"" and this is by far the better DVD set.  Both titles use a lot of liberty in recreating the world the dinosaurs lived in and what their daily lives were like but the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" set covers much more ground and has the better CGI effects of the two.  Both are worthy of purchase, but if you are sitting on the fence trying to determine which is the better buy then look no further.  This is THE standard by which all other dinosaur documentaries are measured.
Kenneth Branagh is far superior to John Goodman in his narration and although the scenes are solely based on the researchers and film-makers imaginations, there are no obvious logic flaws as there are in ""When Dinosaurs Roamed America"".  In that title, a segment on the raptors at one moment describes them as the most intelligent of all the dinosaurs and then the next moment shows them feasting on a carcass while ignoring an oncoming forest fire.  As the other animals flee, they remain and gorge themselves until they consumed in the flames.  That would make them the most ignorant of the dinosaurs at the time, not the most intelligent.
You won't find logic flaws like that in ""Walking with Dinosaurs"".  What you will find is three plus hours of amazing footage and facts that will enable you to see these magnificent creatures like you've never seen them before.  Ever wonder what the dinosaurs of Antarctica were like or imagine an Allosaurus getting taken out by an ocean dwelling carnivore?  You'll see it all here.  This is the closest thing to a National Geographic show on living dinosaurs that we'll ever see.  I only hope that the creators of this series will make more episodes.",1027296000,4,1730,4.714285714285714
1070168,5,6305748853,"I went to see Jurassic Park in the theater. There was a scene early on in the movie where the human characters look, from a distance, at a watering hole where a bunch of dinosaurs are gathered. At that moment, I thought to myself, ""Ditch these tediously stereotypical people, and let's just watch what happens at that watering hole.""
Walking with Dinosaurs was made for people like me.
After rafts of popular books and more documentaries than any one dino-crazed kid can possibly have watched, this BBC series managed to approach the whiz bang subject of dinosaurs in a strikingly new and fresh way. The accomplishment is exhilarating to watch --  engagingly, intelligently written, and visually stunning. I skimmed past the listing when this was originally released in the U.S. -- ""Yeah yeah, another dinosaur special."" My loss. This series and its sequel, Walking with Prehistoric Beasts, are just plain wonderful.
Basically, ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is a faux wildlife documentary. Rather than interspersing brief snippets of dinosaur images and animated sequences with paleontologists, perhaps a popular news anchor, maps, and images of fossils, the program gives us nothing but ""footage"" of dinosaurs and their world. The six episodes in the series obey the narrative structure of an animal documentary show like PBS's ""Nature""; each one is thematically written around a single species or (sometimes) one particular animal. So, we follow a diplodocus as it moves though the stages of its life, moving away on tangents to explore other sides of its world but always coming back to touch on the same individual.
There's a reason regular nature specials get produced this way. It gives the viewer a lens through which to see the larger world. It provides the show with a narrative direction. For dinosaurs those advantages, along with modern cgi effects, work like magic. Partly the effects are quite good, though they were made on a comparative shoestring next to big time effects movies these days. Partly the production here is just so smart, so thoughtful, that it blends just the right admixture of nature show conventions -- camera angles, story arcs -- with those great effects. It flows right, you know? It works.
And yes, of course there's going to be a downside. Because we're seeing thematically composed stories, here, rather than brief shots and cuts away for a learned discussion, we have to rely on Kenneth Branagh's narration for a lot of exposition. We can't see that animated map of plate tectonics in action, no. (""Meanwhile, while our baby diplodocus eats those ferns, Antarctica is moving southward..."") There's quite a bit of speculation, too - unavoidable speculation, when you're working this way. If you're discussing T. Rex on another program, you can waffle about a few different ways it may have hunted. If you're going to write a show around the animal and show it for maybe 30 minutes on screen, it's gonna have to eat something. You can't put that dithered censorship smudge over the moment of the kill to avoid committing yourself to one interpretation or another. You also shouldn't have your narrator break in on the dramatic moment to point out each potential ""reach"" by the scientists who consulted with the producers. (""Or maybe this didn't really happen. Some people think..."") That'd break the form of the shows. And finally, it's very hard on a budget to make the whole, messy world come to life. There are times when it seems like we're seeing a limited range of the bigger, more interesting animals, and maybe there wasn't the money to animate more.
All of which is to say: No, this isn't perfectly respectable, bet-hedging, responsible academic science. (The accompanying ""Making of"" program on the second DVD does tie it back to that world very securely.) This is popular science. It also isn't a major motion picture, though in a lot of ways it's better. Did you notice it was on TV? It does gloss over some murky evolutionary relationships in favor of easier-to-understand offhand lines that help the viewer along.  No, it isn't going to get every postural detail just as the latest journal article had it. What it does do is provide us with some truly amazingly good television to watch.
Anyone could nitpick at this for a few different reasons, it's true -- but if you're enough of a dinosaur buff to nitpick, your expectations will be raised by this program. It's that good.",1023926400,4,4425,4.962264150943396
1070169,5,6305748853,"Our family watched this BBC documentary series some time ago.  My 7, 9 and 12 year olds were captivated every Sunday evening when it appeared on TV.  Now we have it on DVD and it is our co-favourite 'special interest' DVD (along with the BBC's The Planets DVD).  I'll leave the technical comment about the series itself to our paleontologist reviewers suffice to say the technical aspect looked pretty darned good to me and my kids.  Walking with Dinosaurs presents the viewer with a scenario of how life might have been on planet earth in the age of the dinosaur.  The BBC have made an absolutely stunning job of this.  The series is a graphical feast, and at the same time provided an abundance of information. We have to accept that the filmmakers had to make assumptions about how the dinosaurs lived, looked and inhabited the planet.  If we didn't we would have only seen a whole lot of skeletons running and flying around throughout the series.  So, it's a good idea to remind younger viewers that what they are seeing is only an idea as to what actually took place way back then. (albiet a pretty good idea) That qualification aside, this really is a fantastic DVD to own.  It's an essential purchase if you have young kids interested in dinosuars and highly recommended for adults.",1023926400,3,1289,4.643171806167401
1070170,4,6305748853,"Overall this was a very nice program. The CGI was very well done, although it was no where near to the quality of Jurassic Park (hey thats a five star by the way).
  Well then if I liked it so much why did I give it 4 stars? I think there were too many errors littering the film to deserve a perfect rating. And yes, I do know quite a bit on paleontology (exclusively dinosaurs), so do not think I don't know what I'm talking about. If you think I'm wrong, consult the nearest Vertebrate Paleontology resource.
1. They could have done better than the puppets. I don't understand why they just didn't use CGI for those.
2. Yes, Diplodicus did lay eggs because many Titanosaur eggs have been found in argentina and other sites around the world. My problem is that in WWD the sauropods abandon their eggs. I do not believe this to be true. It would make much more sense for the adults to care for their children; the young would be too vulnerable. In fact, I don't think any Jurassic or Cretaceous dinosaur would have left their young to an uncertain fate.
3. Uhhh Allosaurus fragilis had its postorbital horns before its eyes, not above them. Don't believe me? Look at the word POSTORBITAL.
4. Did anyone notice how the Diplodicus's size changed throughout the second episode?
5. Liopleurodon did not get that huge. They reached lengths of 40 feet, not 80.
6. The feathers atop the Ornitholeste's head came from nowhere when he raised them up.
7. I think that the british were making fun of us americans by making the Tyrannosaurus (native to western america) so inaccurate. First of all, the feet were about 3 times larger in life. They had the animal walking on the tips of its toes. NO! Second, the head was way too short and bull-doggish. However I did enjoy the roar.
  Overall you should buy this program. It is very enjoyable to watch and presents a fairly accurate view of the dinosaur world.",1022889600,2,1898,4.508720930232558
1070171,4,6305748853,"This DVD is refreshing. Unlike other dinosaur documentaries, this one presents the subject of dinosaurs from a ""Wild Life Documentary"" perspective. You feel as though you are watching a typical safari documentary on lions and other wild life. The commentary is no different. The scenes are no different. The only difference being you are watching dinosaurs! The producers managed to pull it off very well. At times the realism is very striking and you feel as though you are actually watching real live dinosaurs in their native habitats. Notice I said ""At times""? Well, having a real good eye for detail is sometimes not the best thing. I can see that sometimes the dinosaur computer animation overlays of some of the dinosaur scenes do not have enough contrast and look unnatural compared to the surrounding natural scenery. Most people will not notice this but I do. For me this minor detail makes it difficult for me to get totally immersed in the film. This is one reason why I didn't give this movie more than 4 stars. I did not notice this with any of the underwater scenes. They look completely real to my eyes. Also many of the other scenes look completely real, showing that the producers of this film have the talent to pull off the realism, but failed to do so in some of the scenes, especially with the Tyrannosaurus scenes. This dinosaur is very impressive, but the contrast on the computer animation of this creator is probably the worst of all. His image badly needs more contrast. Its such a minor detail. And its easily fixed. With a little more contrast its image would look more natural compared to the natural scenery. I'm sure its simple for the film makers to go back to the computer program and adjust the contrast of the image to make it match its surroundings better.
I would have gave this film 1/2 of a star more IF the computer animation overlay sequences always had correctly adjusted contrast to match the natural scenery. And an additional 1/2 of a star if there were a few more exciting scenes added. There is one scene were this huge sea dinosaur jumps out of the water and gulps down a large land walking dinosaur. This scene is startling. It will make you jump and clap. Exciting stuff. A little more of this and this DVD would be much more entertaining.
The second DVD that comes in this set is very nice. It shows how everything was done and is quite entertaining. This DVD gets 4 1/2 stars!",1022371200,2,2429,4.612009237875289
1070172,5,6305748853,"I watched this when it aired on the Discovery channel and have all intentions of purchasing the DVDs.
Within the first 20 minutes, I was amazed by the animation.  The Coelophysis was so life-like, I had to remind myself that this is not a typical wildlife documentary.  This six-part dinosaur film is presented as one would expect a documentary on tigers or spiders to be presented.  It followed the story of individual dinosaurs and specific herd and packs.  From a herd of hadrosaur, to the flight across the ocean of a great pterosaur, to the family life of T-Rex.  Almost all of the creatures featured were of believable quality.  The dinosaurs appear to interact with their environment of real-life scenery.
While this is an educational film, it would only be fair to point out that the information and stories about these creatures involve a lot of speculation, but that is to be expected in any dinosaur documentary, especially one presented in this style.
I would recommend 'Walking with Dinosaurs' to anyone who likes dinosaurs, wildlife documentaries, or just want to see something amazing and imaginative.  This is a program I watch when I'm feeling creatively blocked... it really jump-starts my imagination to see these extinct creatures come to such believable life.",1021852800,6,1280,5.037914691943128

The video quality is outstanding. They squeezed 3 and a half hourse of video onto one disc, and it looks better than a lot of 2 hour movies do. The widescreen format makes it look like a movie, as do the incredible special effects. The audio quality is wonderful aswell, and the sounds of the various creatures comes across with great clarity. Kenneth Branagh(sp?)'s narration is wonderful, and was sadly removed from the US broadcast versions, and replaced with Avery Brooks(who makes a much better space-station commander than narrator(He also plays Sisko on Deep Space 9)). The extras are much more than what you would expect from a documentary. A very in-depth making of feature, in glorious widescreen format and running nearly an hour in length would have been enough, but we also get a feature I had never seen before, a ""picture in picture mode"". When activated, a small window will appear ever so often on the screen. Commentary by the series producer will accompany the video in the window on a certain subject.

The series' creators have crafted a nature series in which one follows dinosaurs in much the same way ""Wild Kingdom"" followed living animals, only without the hokey Mutual of Omaha commercials. Of course the science is often quite speculative and 10 years from now much of it may be revised, but this is the state of the art of paleontology as we know it today.
The only thing that keeps this DVD from getting five stars from me is one annoying feature: periodically a distracting icon pops up in the upper right of the screen alerting you to the fact that you can activate a window to see some producer's commentary or a behind-the-scenes look at how a particular scene was filmed. These little extras are rarely all that compelling when the feature is activated but even if you say you want the window turned off, the icon continues popping on, usually obstructing some dinosaur's face for a few seconds just enough to annoy the viewer.
The publishers should have taken better note of the ""popularity"" of Microsoft's talking paperclip. Distractions that cannot be turned off do not belong in this otherwize fantastic bit of film making.",1018483200,2,1217,4.855769230769231
1070255,5,6305748853,"Each of these six half-hour episodes covers a different era and habitat and set of creatures that lived sometime during the 150-million years of The Age of Dinosaurs. We have watched the series twice now, and I am still impressed by the animation techniques, their realism and attention to detail. They are presented as nature films, and it takes me constantly reminding myself to remember that they are not: these are realistic but not real. It is unlikely that children will care to keep that distinction in mind. Not that it matters; this series has the heft of truth, and should instill a love of nature in children, even if it must use the giant and fantastical past to get them started.
The genre of the nature film is an odd one, anyway. Even expert observers of wildlife seldom see much, so it is normally a bit of gentle deception that we are watching a connected narrative: the story is mostly words; the bits of film - of different animals, on different occasions - lend it immediacy and reality, though they are but flashes and glimpses of hidden and conjectured lives. Here, in the distant past, conjecture has even freer reign. I suspect many of the behaviors we see brought to life here were finally decided upon from a wide range of possibilities, but there is no hesitation or qualification in the presentation: this is the way it was. Thus we see ichthyosaurs acting like dolphins, and herbivorous dinosaurs acting like herbivorous grazing mammals, and so on. This is proper to a project of this sort: imaginary plausible facts are much better than tentative waffling when the purpose is primarily inspirational.

And here, in the fully-domesticated distant past, the creatures are without stage fright, so the visuals are all they need to be to tell a story in leisurely detail. We follow an aging pterosaur hundreds and thousands of weary miles to its traditional breeding grounds for yet another season, and see it to its sad end among its own kind, worn out and defenseless. A tyrannosaurus mother is killed in a freak accident at the end of the Cretaceous, leaving her tiny offspring to their fates. And as she dies, we feel, too, that we are watching the death of a whole world.
Perhaps that is the supreme virtue of this series: that world is dead and gone, but something of the tragedy of its dying has been put across to us, so many millions of years later. Maybe it will help us love our own world better.",1016150400,3,2433,4.671328671328672

Disk one contains six episodes of six chapters each. Disk two contains an eight chapter ""making of"" documentary.
This is a worthwhile set to buy if you have pre-teen children, or older children who are interested in dinosaurs. The program consists of real and synthetic landscapes with dinosaurs portrayed by puppetry or through digital synthesis, or both. It's well shot, reminding me of a high-budget version of the computer game ""Nanosaur"".
The program gets repetitive -- the dinos lay eggs, they protect their eggs, they have to run from predators, or have to hunt prey or scavenge the dead and dying. Each of the episodes is about 29 minutes long, and the only differences between them are the environments and species. I understand why it is that shows that seem too short get aired -- the audience is left wanting more. I don't think of this set as being suitable for adults, whereas children can watch these 29 minute episodes on six consecutive days, and thereafter for months on end before tiring of it.
Another deficiency is the complete lack of the Alvarez theory. The outmoded and discredited volcanic extinction is offered in episode six. That is simply inexcusable. I presume this stems from this program having been produced by the BBC in the homeland of Darwin and other dead gradualists.
My personal favorites are (in order) the ""making of"" documentary on disk two, ""Cruel Sea"", ""Giant of the Skies"", and ""Spirits of the Ice Forest"".",993254400,,1470,4.955465587044534

And what an intreging idea:  a camera crew goes back in time and documents the habitats of these creatures that watched the earth millions of years before us and millions of years longer than us.  It's presentations like WALkING that make you wonder about our place in the world.  I get a similar feeling with the Jodie Foster movie CONTACT.  WALKING is overflowing with quality.  Even when the makers had to guess about certain looks and behaviors (i.e., the color of dinosaurs and the way a ornithocheirus walks when it's not flying) are all wonderfully educated.
Now, I was all set to give this a lower score (4 stars) because I noticed that the picture seemed to be bobbing up and down a little and ""fluttering"" at times.  That may just be my player program so I'll not downgrade it yet.
Be sure to watch the wonderful ""Making of..."" documentary AFTER you have watched all parts of the program.  I think it makes the overall impact less potient when you know how things were done. But DO watch it because it's alternatingly funny and enlightening.

1070390,5,6305748853,"This is unbelievably AMAZING!!! It's even better than movie! I just really like the features and the graphics of the dinosaurs shown in this eye-popping documentary. It's divided into 6 parts; New Blood, Time of the Titans, Cruel Sea, Giant of the Skies, Spirits of the ice forest, and Death of a Dynasty. I especially like the Coelophysis, Postosuchus and Plateosaurus in the ""New Blood"" Because for the Plateosaurus is the largest dinosaur in this chapter. The Coelophysis looks so real that it feels like you're taping the scene right now. For the Crocodile looking Postosuchus it was the largest carnivore on Earth that time (220 million years ago).  What I like about second part is that it mostly shows the large sauropods especially Diplodocus. I also like the part when Allosaurus attacks the small Diplodocus but fails to kill. For the third part I like the part when Eustreptospondylus gets captured by a whale-sized carnivore called Liopleurodon and gets plunged into the water. The hybodus sharks are much different shark from today but they still look so real. The ramphorynchus sure flies like a real one. The Opthalmosaurus looks just like a real ichtyosaur from back in time.  For the fourth part I like the Utahraptors when they kill the iguanodons, I also like the part where Ornithocheirus was set off for his journey. For the fifth it's pretty amazing that this part shows how dinosaurs lived in Antaractica about 108 million years ago. I like the large carnivorous amphibian called Koolasuchus with a head like boomerang, and also the dwarf allosaur, a relative species to the larger Allosaurus from Jurassic, the small dinosaurs called Leallynasaura and the Muttaburrasaurus the dinosaur who makes sound like trumpet.
  For the last this is my favorite. I think T-Rex looks more real than in any other dinosaur films. I also like the part where Ankylosaurus smashes her club into female T-Rex's thigh. I think I believe the result that dinosaurs wiped out by an astroid. This film shows the part where astroid falls  I liked the way ""Rancor"" blasted this series into wrong conclusions.

Needless to say, and as one may see from the 5 stars I gave it, it was a choice I never regretted since...
""Walking with Dinosaurs"" is a visually brilliant piece of documentary work, combining a dazzling array of computed-generated imagery and animatronics.  The 2-disc set comes with bonus pictures such as PIP, a ""making-of"" featurette and subtitling.  The main feature is divided into 6 main chapters, with each focusing either on a particular period (e.g. Late Triassic in ""New Blood"") or type of creature (i.e. a pteranodon in ""Giant of the Skies"", ocean-dwellers in ""Cruel Seas"").
What can I say?  It's a visually breathtaking experience, presented ala a National Geographic or Discovery Channel special, actual documentary.  Some scenes are very graphic (i.e., when the velociraptor was feasting on a newly-hatched diplodocus, when a baby diplodocus was accidentally killed by the spiked tail of a stegosaurus).  Some where hair-raisingly shocking (e.g. when the hige sea creature came out of nowhere to grab the unsuspecting raptor-like dinosaur).  It's simply amazing, especially for one such as I (and I believe millions of other people) who grew up with a wide-eyed fascination for dinosaurs.  It's like seeing them for the first time (check it out - the T-Rex' saliva even splashed onto the camera lens! Ughhhh....:)

These 6 Episodes take us, the viewers through the Life and Times of these creatures that walked the earth before us.  The special effects, with or without footprints, with or without thumping earth-shaking sounds show us enough, with the latest scientific findings, to give us what we could not picture before.
More than that, they have taken pains in their research to ""put to Life"" the creatures in terrain that were nearest to what the Dinosaurs were roaming in.
The narration by Kenneth Branagh is authoritative and the material is entertaining and educational.  No matter that the producers admit to some guess-work, but we know no more than mere fossils and skeletons found anyway.  Even some of the Scientists and Paleontologists agree that with the animation, they have new theories of how some of the dinosaurs moved!
A plus for DVD is the picture-in-picture feature that shows some of the behind-the-scenes and explanatory footage.  Also on DVD is a second disc of 50-mins documentary showing the ""making of"".

1070456,5,6305748853,"I had first seen this series on the Discovery channel quite by accident. I  was channel surfing one Sunday night, flipping through different  combinations of a 100+ different channels when I flashed across something  that caught my attention. Having backtracked to the channel, I saw a  spectacular scene of a dinosaur that was standing by an ancient ocean soon  become the meal of a monstrous reptile. This massive reptile turned out to  be some 25 meters in length and weighed something like 150 tons. From that  point on I was glued to the television and watched the rest of the entire  series. Needless to say, I bought the video. This video documentary of  computer generated dinosaurs and ancient reptiles is a masterpiece of  anything of its kind. It is brilliantly narrated and very well put together  in a documentary style much like the other documentaries that air on the  Discovery Channel. Of course, nobody really knows how these magnificent  beasts existed, but this video surely has done a splendid job of portraying  these beasts of how they could have lived. I highly recommend this video to  anyone who has wondered how these animals lived. One thing is for sure  after viewing this video, man would not be the master of the planet as he  is today if these beasts still existed. The dinosaurs were truly the rulers  of the world.",968112000,11,1348,4.78695652173913
1070457,3,6305748853,"It is absolutely amazing that paleontology and computer animation are so  advanced that programs like this are possible.  While watching it, I  laughed a lot--in delight, surprise, and at the occasional howler.
  Howlers first:  Like any other reptile, Postosuchus had eyes on the sides,  not the front, of its head.  So therefore it would not have swiveled its  head like a monkey to peer this way and that, to see if the coast is clear.  It already had about 100 degrees viewing angle on each side.  Additionally, Iguanodon chicks would be highly unlikely to have tumbled and  frolicked like puppies.  There's only so much complex behavior you can cram  into a brain the size of a golf ball, which has little in the way of  frontal lobes to boot.  Finally, I was disappointed that there was no  segment on crested dinosaurs.  It would have been interesting to hear all  the different nasal honks those crests produced.
  Each episode  contains one or two life and death scenarios for the beasties involved.  The life cycles of the Diplodocus and the Ophthalmosaurus are especially  well realized, if necessarily a bit fanciful.  The computer animations are  in most instances convincing, in particular the underwater scenes.  Watching the gigantic Liopleurodon loom out of the depths is impressive.  And there are plenty of toothy carnosaurs to thrill to.
  What's funny  is how some parts of the program are produced in imitation of real nature  documentaries.  We soar alongside a pterosaur, like a cameraman in an  ultralight filming migrating geese.  Spotlights on the sea floor illuminate  the Jurassic reef and its creatures.  And, cutest of all, the night scenes  of the Cynodont are rendered to look like infrared film footage, as if we  were viewing a National Geographic film of a Serengeti watering hole at  night.
  Agree or disagree with this program's reconstructions of  dinosaurs' appearance and behavior, you'll watch every minute of it.",965433600,9,1956,5.037854889589905
1070458,1,6305748853,"I know that this review will gain me quite a few enemies. I don't care. It must be said. Walking With Dinosaurs is one of the worst shows I've ever seen, riddled with inaccuracies. To show that I'm not some stupid  know-it-all, I have a list of its wrongdoings.
Episode 1: First off,  neither Placerias nor Postosuchus were cold-blooded. They weren't even  reptiles. Postosuchus was a Psuedosuchian, an ancestor of the dinosaurs,  who were also not reptiles. Placerias was a Protomammal, the predecessors  of modern mammals. This episode also starts off the depressing and  infuriating anti-dinosaur, pro-mammal bias that is carried on throughout  the series.
Episode 2: This was the worst. First of all, Diplodocus DID  NOT LAY EGGS. The newborns were one-fifth the size of adults, too large to  be layed in an egg. The large pelvic opening on females supports this. They  were born live. And that's not the only unforgivable flaw. The point on the  skull where it meets the neck is at a right angle, meaning that if it  walked around with its neck stretched out, it would be perpetually staring  at the ground. Not only that, but it suffers from a problem which effects  almost every dino in the series: croc lips. Look at the skull, and you'll  see tiny holes along the jaws. These are where the blood vessels and nerves  went into the lips and cheeks, so that their food never fell out while  eating. One last diplodocus flaw is herd structure. In the series, the herd  is spread out and loose. Fossil trackways show that they walked with adults  on the outside, protecting the young in the center.
Episode 3: Not too  many in thos one, except the croc lips and the floppy-winged Rhamphorynchs.  Their wings were reinforced with tendon and muscle, and were stronger than  they look.
Episode 4: A huge case of self-contradiction. According to the  narrator, dinosaurs are reptiles. Now watch the Utahraptors. The animators  really got it right. They move exactly like birds.
Episode 5: Not much,  except for the usual reptile garbage. The muttaburrasaurus just didn't look  real.
Episode 6: While I just can't hate anything with a Rex in it, this  episode is terrible. Take a look at those ""Dromeosaurs"". They  look more like Deinonychus, except for the fact that Deinonychus was  already extinct by the time T-rex came on the scene. Dromeosaurs have more  squarish heads. Quetzalcoatlus was far too small, also. And the ending.  GOD, I hate the ending! And it's not just the ending, but throughout the  whole episode is the depressing sense of doom, up to the end where they  blatantly show the dinosaurs as big, stupid, doomed beasts, forever  destined to be overthrown by the ever-industrious mammal. I'd also like to  say that the meteor theory is the most implausible load of garbage theory  I've ever heard.
In conclusion, this series is a mess of lies,  self-contradictions, anti-reptile(and bird) bias, and glaring inaccuracies  whoes only redeeming quality is the CGI. And even that's not the best. I  saw better CGI in the Filter ""Take A Picture"" video.",964656000,10,3066,4.868217054263566
1070459,5,6305748853,"I loved this video because of the great animation and computer effects. I learned a lot from the video.

1070460,5,6305748853,"""Walking With Dinosaurs"" is the kind of documentary that digital and other high tech methods of animation were made for!  Granted, Spielberg used some similar methods to good effect in his dino-films ""Jurassic  Park"" and ""Lost World,"" but ""Walking With  Dinosaurs"" is the current apex of animation technology for exctinct  animals, and used for education, too!
I sat in awe as I watched these six  wonderful segments on the natural history of dinosaurs produced by the BBC.  I was particularly impressed by the segment on marine reptiles -- a group  that receives relatively little press, since they're not dinos, and since  they don't interact with most peoples' favorites, like T. rex, Allosaurus,  or Stegosaurus, etc.
Never had I seen recreations of dinosaurs that  were as life-like and convincing (except for the occasional animatronic  effect) as the ones in this video.
Watching these segments about  different time periods, places, and groups of dinosaurs I was once again  reminded and impressed by the long reign of these animals on the earth.  I  also thought that many aspects of their biology and ecology were  interestingly presented.  No one was, of course, around to see what these  animals actually did, so the way dinos are presented in the video are  unavoidably informed guesses about how we think that these now extinct  animals lived.  I applaud the author and producer for their fine  efforts!
Viewers should be aware, however, that there is a large and  convincing alternative body of information (backed by a significant number  of paleontologists) that suggests that carnivorous dinosaurs like  Allosaurus, T. rex, and even Utahraptor did not run down their prey, bring  them down, and kill them like a giant lion would -- i.e., overpowering and  killing their prey immediately.  The alternative proposal about how the  meateaters did their business is akin to the way that monitor lizards, like  the Komodo Dragon, bring down their prey.  Dragons inflict a slashing bite,  even a relatively small one on their prey.  When they do that bacteria that  live on their teeth are introduced into the prey's body.  After a while the  prey animal succumbs to the bacterial infection and the dragon can eat at  will.  Granted, this method of attack and subjugation is less dramatic than  the hunt and kill method portrayed a couple of times in this video series,  but it's an equally if not even more convincing story about how large meat  eaters may well have done their business.
Those kinds of academic  debates aside, this is a wonderful, brilliant series.  The imagery is  excellent, the soundtrack is supportive and enhancing, and the narration is  outstanding!  I will watch this series again and again.
5 stars all the  way!

It is really neat to see  how they made this, and they put some additional dino animation which I  thought was clever and funny.  The first disk has a cute menu screen and it  presents the dinosaurs and other animals in the land, sea, and air during  three different time periods.  Although I have a problem with the theory  that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago, I do dismiss this because it is  the popular view point and the series is based on the 'popular theory'.

Although the documentaries are interesting, the best part of  this DVD is the special feature documentary -- done with a touch of  humor.
One choice of the director was to forego any ""This is what we  here at the BBC have speculated and decided to do for this recreation of a  possible dinosaur scene"" and to merely present the stories as fact.  This was slightly strange to get used to, but soon I was watching without  any thought of computer animation (no doubt the aim of the animators).  They even used a ""night vision filter"" in one of the segments --  quite humorous.  Kenneth Branaugh's narration is a joy to listen to, and  the script is mostly interesting with a few moments of repetition and  tedium.
If your child loves dinosaurs, this would be a great choice for  their viewing, since it's done in an informative style, and it affords a  chance to ""view them in their habitat"" as opposed to as cute  cartoon caricatures or just a stack of bones.",960336000,6,1109,4.703125

Another major reason why I liked it, you actually learn about  dinosaurs that you never heard of in school and from the movies.  Wow!

I can't break her away from it! ""Walking With  Dinosaurs"" is NOT a smattering of general info on many different  dinosaurs.  Instead it is a close up look at several different dinosaurs  that lived during the three periods of their history.  I especially loved  the ""Giants of the Skys"" chapter.  It's very dramatic.

There have been many  attempts at bringing these magnificent beasts back to life, but it wasn't  until computer graphics had advanced to their current stage of perfection  that humanity has had the possibility of resurrecting these prehistoric  creatures from their obscure graves in a way that actually lets us join in  and literally become a part of their daily struggle for survival.
As a  Christian, I personally prefer the creationistic model of origins to the  evolutionistic model proposed in this documentary, but I very highly regard  the scientific effort put into the making of this series, giving us a  credible scientific guess as to what the lives of these awesome creatures  were actually like. As ""The Making of..."" shows, there was also  much effort, quite a bit of imagination, innovation and even a bit of  humour put in on the part of the engineering crew in attempting to figure  out how these creatures actually moved or mated, sometimes surprising even  the palaeontologists. Good work!
The DVD, which includes the six-part  series, ""The Making of..."" and several other goodies, is of a  very high quality.

This  documentary is done exactly like a National Geographic one. The narrator  follows the path of several different species over a few years and the  outcome is fantastic.

Being an illustrator in the traditional and computer fields myself I can tell you that the images are not what the film is about. If a  viewer is interested in watching it for the thrill or the  entertainment,that is all fine and well, but it was made to disseminate  some very important scientific information:
The fact that evolution has  occurred, and that to say that it hasn't is to be willfully blind to the  evidence. True, there was a great deal of speculation. But any person with  at least a rudimentary intellect can separate the FACTS from the  specualtion.
And I capitalize the word FACTS because there are facts  about evolution that as an educated and learned society in the 21st century  we are expected to know.
Incidentally, in case you're interested there is  a book by Tim M. Berra called EVOLUTION AND THE MYTH OF CREATIONISM - a  basic guide to the facts in the evolution debate. It is available in the  Amazon BOOK section ... and it is worth every penny.

More so,  the narration on this release is more informed than the US broadcast, often  giving sound explantations for events not explained in the latter.  What  was most disturbing was the consistant omission of entymological and  botanical material in the US broadcast--you can imagine my thrill at  discovering this material had been restored!  Also, there seems to be a  blunder in the version that was broadcast, dating the appearance of birds  too early (I think!) and without fanfare, while the full version actually  notes their appearance and explans a little of the phylogeny.
While I was  certainly impressed with the US broadcast, this DVD is a sort of dream come  true, correcting most of the faults I found with the version on Discovery  Channel--including the reduction of its overly dramatic tone.  I must also  say that the elimination of constant plugs to visit Discovery Channel's web  page (obscuring a 3rd of the screen) is alone reason enough to purchase.

What can you say, this show is so good that as a dino lover  you feel that you've slipped into an alternate universe where people  actually make shows you dream of seeing. I still can't believe this is a  made for television production as it looks more impressive than virtually  every cinematic film I've seen. As a CG buff I can say it's no exaggeration  to say that the visual effects are on par or better than anything Hollywood  and ILM can muster, they definetly make Jurassic Park and the Lost World  look prehistoric, and we get nearly 3 hours of dinos, IN THE DAYLIGHT, long  lingering shots on screen all the time, and made on 1/20th the budget. Hats  off to the BBC, they know how to make the good stuff. You gotta love those  snarling Utahraptors or those spectacular fly-by's of the Sauropod herds,  it's just like being there.
In case people are interested two follow-up  series are already in production!  and the CG crew from WWD is working on  the Dinotopia mini series as well as Jason and the Argonauts.

It  presents key developments in the evolution of the dinosaurs. The narration  of events as they unfold on screen is provided by the wonderful  Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh, who's voice and delivery adds gravitas  to the production.

The effects are by far  the best every done specifically for a TV show.  No they're not as good as  Jurassic Park, but then again they didn't have the budget of a JP  either....  not to mention the dinos in JP had only about 20 min total  screen time and WWD has about 2 hours.  The long ""eye of God""  panning shot of the brachiosaurs is just beautiful.  I've seen complaints  that there is too much speculation but that's inherit in studying things  that no longer exist with sparse physical data.

1070807,5,6305748853,"I agree with another review, this program is a difintive Dinosaur Documentary.  The documentary begins at the start of Jurassic period and take you through to the bitter end.  You are narrated through various  ecosystem that existed at the time.  Experts in the field present the  theories behind the color, eating habits, and other behaviors of these  creatures.  I would highly recommend this film to those interested in the  creatures that move about the earth in the Jurassic period.",956102400,,487,5.075949367088608
1070808,5,6305748853,"The video was everything the commercials said it would be and more. It held our interest for the entire 3 hours, and even my toddler was fascinated by the ""dinos"". We would recommend it to any family  that wants a fun activity that everyone can learn from.",956102400,,256,4.446808510638298
1070809,3,6305748853,"Sorry Sorry Sorry, but NO!  I watched this special with some other members of my family, and even though I am a dinosaur and cgi buff, this did little to impress me.  The effects were sub-par.  Saying they are better than JP  is pure ignornace talking, and that is somewhat sad considering JP came out  in 1994, 6 years before WWD.  Some shots consisted of a ""head on a  stick"" litteraly moved around by a wooden pole.  The integration of  cgi and real life terrain was not done well, look at Jurrasic Park, ILM  knows how to do it correctly.  If it were not so focused on it's sub-par  effects work, this would be a great documentary, but stop with the ignorant  analysis of the effects work, they could have been done better, much  better.
As a documentary, it was quite informative, though as most do,  it was mearly all the previous documentary's pulled into one, with few  fresh ideas.",956102400,,890,4.46875
1070810,5,6305748853,"I thought this was a spectacular effort on the part of the animators and very well put together. Some of the science behind it was a little iffy but on the whole, a great job! Watch out for the Jello.",956016000,3,200,4.025
1070811,5,6305748853,"This program is the result of the thoughtful collaboration of brilliant paleontologists and animators.  While much of it is the result of deduction and speculation (and admittedly so by the makers) you will find that the  guesswork is educated and thoughtful, such that the results are logical and  believable.  Visually, it is stunning like any other well-made nature  documentary, but this one's special because it's as close as you can get to  seeing a ""real"" dinosaur in its natural habitat.
If you have  any appreciation at all for the prehistoric world that came before the  ""age of man"" then you will find this informative and highly  entertaining.  Only those deluded enough to think that our planet is a mere  5000 years old will be put off (there's a good scientific reason why  dinosaurs don't appear in man-made cave paintings, it's because they became  extinct before humans evolved).",956016000,6,897,5.020408163265306
1070812,5,6305748853,"This is the difinitive dinosaur documentary! Every other one, in the past, cannot even come close. Every other documentary I have seen in the past had always had a boring person, sitting in front of a skelaton, talking. Maybe  some illistration, some claymation, animation, animatronics and a little  more recently cgi animation. This video uses animatronics for all  close-ups, but the rest is cgi animated and it is supperb! What all other  dinosaur movies should base themselves on. It was entertaining,  intelligent, and educational. It even got my 18 month old daughter's  attention...And my chihuahua enjoyed howling at the baby  diplodocous(spelling?). Buy it, rent it, watch it on tv. See it once,  because it will stay with you forever.",955929600,12,745,5.201680672268908
