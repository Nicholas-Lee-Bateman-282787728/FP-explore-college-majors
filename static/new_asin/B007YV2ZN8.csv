5114880,4,B007YV2ZN8,"This was a very good story of the lives of a first, second and third generation Japanese family as they immigrate to and try to assimilate in America as told from a Japanese perspective.  It tells of the hardships they faced during both the early immigration period and later during World War 2 when they were harshly discriminated against and interned in camps within the US after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The story of these war years is seen through  the perspective of both the USA and Japan with some of the family living in the US at that time and some of them residing in Japan during that period. One of the second generation sons joins the army and goes off to fight in Europe during the war while two other second generation daughters, who had returned to Japan, are caught in the horrors of Hiroshima. The story continues after the war with how the family struggles to hold themselves together despite losses and having to start completely over after they leave the internment camp.  Although this movie was made for Japanese TV and has somewhat of a ""Hallmark movie"" feel to it there is still a lot of relevance to it and it sheds a lot of insight into the difficulties and discrimination they faced. I think there are 5 episodes in the 3 disc set so it is a long movie. It covers a time span in the family's life of almost 100 years. I would recommend it as an interesting movie with a different viewpoint than we usually see this historical time period shown in here in the USA both for Japanese Americans and everyone else. You definitely come away with a new respect for all that the Japanese have faced in immigrating to America, for their contributions to this country and the fortitude, love, dignity and support shown each other within their family. Being a first generation immigrant myself, although not from Japan, I found their story very poignant and perhaps a little more compelling. Very nice cinematography too.",1336867200,14,1952,4.632947976878612
5114881,5,B007YV2ZN8,"Was lucky to have found this movie on DVD.  Since, have purchased two additional copies to share with family who live in distant states. Great movie.  A must see !!!!!!  Thumbs up.....enjoyed by all ages, (English sub titles)",1440028800,,225,4.868421052631579
5114882,4,B007YV2ZN8,"The series itself is really good and is shockingly close to my family's history. My only complaint is that the english subtitles are kinda funky. My Japanese isn't the best, but I understand more just listening to the audio than I do trying to read the subtitles.",1422316800,,263,4.617021276595745
5114883,4,B007YV2ZN8,"I have yet to watch the discs.  But, I am very familiar with the show. My wife and I watched and  DVRed it on the NHK cable channel.  I then watched it again, several more times.  That version was approximately 10 hours, two  one hour segments on each of 5 nights.  I ordered this copy Amazon so I could erase the 10 hours from my DVR.

I purchased the discs so I could loan them to friends.  My wife is Japanese and was very surprised to see the characters on the box were not Japanese, they are Chinese!.  I suspect this set was made for the Chinese market. .I just do not have time to watch it again.

I will, however, comment that the version NHK broadcast showed Japanese subtitles when English was being spoken and English when Japanese was spoken.  It is a wonderful story, .in the style of a Michener novel.  All Americans should watch it to see how unfairly America treated Japanese Americans, putting into concentration camps US citizens, many never having been in Japan and did not speak Japanese.. Since this is a Japanese production  it is a chance to overcome the old saying,  ""After a war, the winners get to write the history books"".",1414281600,2,1149,4.435406698564593
5114884,1,B007YV2ZN8,"This is an excellent movie, however, the English translation was so poorly done that much of the subtitles did not make any sense.
The DVD was therefore a huge disappointment.  I had to return it.  This is unfortunate because I know many people who I would have liked to recommend it to.  There are many second, third, and fourth generation Japanese-Americans who would have benefited from such a wonderful movie.  I own a Japanese version, but fewer descendants are bilingual and therefore would not be able to benefit from a Japanese version.",1411689600,,544,4.880434782608695
5114885,3,B007YV2ZN8,"The story of Japanese immigrants hardships in America is great. However, if you need to use the english subtitles then prepare to be confused. The words are out of order and so consistently wrong that it was comical.",1398124800,2,216,4.7105263157894735
5114886,1,B007YV2ZN8,"The translation came out poorly. It was very disappointing! Couldn't they find a better translator? The story line is interesting so
it made the Dvd a letdown.",1397260800,2,159,4.925925925925926
5114887,4,B007YV2ZN8,"Historical story - well presented and acted but the subtitling was TERRIBLE.  Finally had to turn off subtitle - too distracting and frustrating.  They didn't even translate what was spoken in Japanese.  Just said ""Speaks in Japanese"".  They could have used a better company to do the translating",1391126400,,296,5.104166666666667
5114888,2,B007YV2ZN8,"I heard so much about this made-for-TV movie that I had to purchase it.  The movie is fantastic!  My father served in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and I've visited the Manzanar Internment Camp so I really relate to this move.  Why only 2 stars?  The English subtitles are just terrible!!!  I know a little Japanese and the subtitles are sooooooo wrong!  Most of the subtitles are not even close to what they are saying, My guess is that the translation company that was hired, was doing just that, they were guessing!!!  I won't even go into the hundreds of typos that went along with the ""out in right field"" subtitles.  To add insult to injury, even when the actors spoke in English, the English subtitles were wrong????????  To get the full essence of the movie, I will be watching the Japan version, with correct English subtitles, via the internet.  I strongly suggest that you do not purchase this DVD unless it is redone with correct subtitles and made in Japan.  Made in Japan?  Don't know what language characters are on the cover of the DVD but it certainly is not Japanese.",1382918400,4,1088,4.609375
5114889,1,B007YV2ZN8,"Maybe one day Amazon will stop selling these Chinese or Singaporean bootlegs. Evidently today is not that day. In the meantime, you can watch this magnificent series with subtitles that were written by people who actually speak English if you search online for ""99 Nen no Ai watch online.""",1379376000,6,289,4.918367346938775
5114890,1,B007YV2ZN8,"I chose this DVD box set for the English subtitles so that my non-Japanese speaking friends could enjoy it with me.  I speak Japanese and I find it extremely distracting because I find myself looking at the chopped-up, broken English translation.  If I didn't understand Japanese and had to rely on the English subtitles, I wouldn't enjoy the movie at all.  I have suspicions that this is a pirated version that you can buy on the street in China for a few dollars.  I know that there is a genuine version available with proper English translation.  Don't buy this one!",1375228800,11,569,4.65
5114891,3,B007YV2ZN8,"My review is negative because of the poor english translation.  I was ""Lost in Translation""  That film should have never been available with those subtitles.  It made a good film frustrating to watch especially over a 3 DVD boxset, about 15 hrs.  It was bad enough that the nisei spoke to each other in Japanese but to have the translation come out in garbled english how are you supposed to understand? Is this a pirated copy? Could I return this boxset for a more accurate english translation?  I liked the film and would like others to see it but the translation subtitles are a joke at times.",1373414400,5,596,4.5327102803738315
5114892,4,B007YV2ZN8,"This is a very good production and tells an untold story of what happened to American citizens of Japanese descent at the outbreak of WW II.  Conversely, the subtitles are truly bad and require a working understanding of the Japanese spoken language and nuances.",1373068800,,262,4.954545454545454

5114894,4,B007YV2ZN8,"This was a great story, however tragic..........something that too many suffered through.  Everyone who managed to escape the encampments should appreciate the hardships and losses these Japanese people endured.  I liked and enjoyed all aspects of this film, except for the English subtitles.  Whoever translated was very inept and not at all proficient in the Japanese-English translation.  The subtitles at times flashed on for just a fraction of a sentence, too litle time to read.",1362873600,,484,5.413333333333333

5114897,5,B007YV2ZN8,"I am in love with this story. Too many Americans do not know of the struggles that the Japanese Immigrants of the early 20th century.  How hard they worked for decades, raising families, only to lose everything because of WWII. We grew up watching movies like Tora Tora Tora and hating what happened that fateful morning of Dec 7, 1941. We saw the retaliation of our troops and cheered the victory.  Unfortunately, most Americans don't know of the inhumane treatment that we gave to the Japanese Immigrants as well as their American born Japanese children when we singled them out and put them in the prisons we called Internment Camps. They held their dignity high and suffered the humility for those years. And almost NO Americans know of the Japanese Military Unit that fought so bravely and gave up so many lives to save other Americans (the Texas unit trapped by the Nazis). This story should be told on American TV.  My only complaint with this DVD is that the 'Subtitles/translations' are off. I saw the original Japanese TV version with it's subtitles and thankfully remember and can 'mentally' correct the errors that I find.  I have viewed this many times and have shown it to my daughter who is also enjoying it. Thank you.",1355702400,9,1234,4.725581395348837
5114898,1,B007YV2ZN8,The version was unwatchable as it has the worst English subtitles I have ever seen on a movie. You can view this fantastic mini-series online (with commercials) but with much better subtitles.,1348790400,6,192,5.03125
5114899,5,B007YV2ZN8,"This Japanese immigrant family saga of three generations based on humanity is a part of American history itself. Hiramatsu family shows courage, universal justice, overcoming racism and hardship, and finanl assimilation in the States while maintaining their unique Japanese identity. English subtitles are somewhat poor.
Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this DVD not only for Asian Americans but also all Americans.",1344384000,,417,5.966666666666667
5114900,5,B007YV2ZN8,"I see my family in the faces of this movie.  I am a third-generation Japanese-American, Sansei.  My parents and grandparents were interned in the Heart Mountain Camp.  I found this movie very interesting.  I could not stop watching it. I wish that my parents were still alive so that I could ask them if this is what they encountered because they never wanted to talk about those years.  It was a very difficult time and I can only feel pride in how they lived their life after the war.

The chronicle of this family's life from leaving home in Japan and coming to the United States was very well done.  It tied in nicely with the present by bringing in sights of Seattle and Safeco field.  I agree with the other comment about the movie being a little Hallmark-ish, maybe even a little predictable, but it's a movie made for TV afterall.",1337644800,7,838,4.467105263157895
8523182,5,B007YV2ZN8,If you don't know much about the internment of the Nisei Japanese generation this movie is a must watch. Granted it is written and produced by a Japanese film team for viewing in Japan so it is a little Japancentric but it is a fairly accurate depiction focusing on a single family and their immigration struggles during the early 20th Century in the United States. When I say accurate I have first hand stories from someone who went through a similar situation.,1516579200,,462,4.646341463414634

8523184,2,B007YV2ZN8,"The video quality of this newer release of this outstanding Japan TV series is significantly improved over the earlier release  that was given to us several years ago. However, the  translation  with this newer release is awful.  It is often  confusing, and often does not make sense. It uses expressions that seem to be  inappropriate for the particular scene. It was  so bad, that we stoppped  watching the first episode and returned it.  The earlier release with the poor  video quality, and better translation is the better version.

8523189,5,B007YV2ZN8,"Aside from some deux ex machina plot twists, it was a very compelling series, and best watched all at one sitting.  Score was fabulous, actors were good and the only draw back was that the plot line calls for main characters in the beginning to be in their early to mid 80's and while I concede that some Asians age very well, the actors looked more in their 60's and 70's than 80's.  Otherwise, very good series, and highly recommended.  (I am buying copies and giving them away.)",1448668800,,481,4.443181818181818
