8339349,1,B001S29PGE,"Nazareth must have been novices to Live performances.  I was not impressed by any thing on this DVD.  I brought it
for ""Love Hurts"" The DVD version doesn't sound anything like the version heard on radio 80's Rock.",1397433600,3,213,4.578947368421052

8339351,5,B001S29PGE,"There are a couple of offical dvd's showing the recent version of Nazareth out there.  They are very very good.  They were awesome to watch until I got this.  This is Classic line up Naz, circa 1985 and the band kicks major a**.  Even though the show is about an hr long, the band tear through 12 or so songs like they just released the songs on record. Great video, great sound, great concert.  Now bring on some 70's era live band stuff.",1314489600,10,439,4.240963855421687
