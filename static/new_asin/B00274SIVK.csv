3858253,5,B00274SIVK,"Finally, one TV's most beloved sitcoms from the 1960's arrives on DVD July 21, 2009. After releasing Lucille Ball's first series in its entirety, ""I Love Lucy"", CBS Home Video is bringing out, what I consider, one of the best television shows of all-time.
 ""The Lucy Show"" was Lucille Ball's follow-up to her immensely popular 1950's TV program, and at first she was hesitant to do another weekly series for a variety of reasons: first, she knew the work involved in doing a TV show week after week, and secondly she also didn't know if the audience would accept her playing a widow, as she and Desi Arnaz were so closely identified as America's first TV couple. Since she and Desi were now divorced, having them star in a television show together was virtually impossible. One of the stipulations she had with the new CBS show was that she wanted Desi to be its executive producer, (which he was that first season), as Lucy knew Desi had the mind and ability to produce a top-rated show, and she wanted her best friend, Vivian Vance, to star along with her. Lucy's demands were met.
 ""The Lucy Show"", originally titled ""The Lucille Ball Show"" in its inception, aired its first episode on October 1, 1962. Lucy played Lucy Carmichael, a widow raising 2 children, a daughter Chris, played by Candy Moore, and a son Jerry, played by Jimmy Garrett. Lucy shared her home with her best friend Vivian, played superbly by Vance, who had a son Sherman, portrayed by Ralph Hart. Although many TV historians state that it was Ann Romano, from ""One Day at a Time"", who played TV's first divorced woman, that distiction, however, belongs to Vivian Vance, who was the medium's first divorcee in this series. ""The Lucy Show"" followed the adventures of Lucy and Vivian, as they raised their children alone, and encountered various mishaps while living without men. The series explored what it was like for two women maintaining a household all alone, and the series depicted the problems each had with their personal lives, such as finding Mr. Right.
 ""The Lucy Show"" is one of my favorite shows ever, and I actually love it even more than ""I Love Lucy"". This long awaited boxset of the series' first season, features 30 episodes, that have been rarely seen over the years. This first season is filmed in glorious black and white, but subsequent seasons were filmed in color as Lucille Ball knew they could be more easily sold in syndication than the black and white ones. The show continued to be broadcast in black and white until the 1965 season, but at the beginning of the 1963 season filming in B&W was discontinued. These 30 shows are some of the best work Lucille Ball ever did in her career, albeit they have hardly been seen by newer audiences. Many of the writers from ""I Love Lucy"" wrote many of these 30 shows, and their originality and creativity is evident. The best episodes from this season are: ""Lucy and Viv Put in a TV Antenna"", in which Lucy and Vivian go to extremes to go up on the roof to install a new antenna, as their signal is gone. This episode is hilarious, especially when one watches it during this day in time as many of us have cable and satellite, but the writing is dead on, and the performances, along with Lucy and Viv's physical comedy, are at its zenith. Another great show is ""Lucy and Viv Put In A Shower"", where the roomates install a new shower, as they realize having one bathroom doesn't cut it for a home housing 5 people. While doing the shower scene Lucille Ball almost drowned, and thanks to Vivian Vance, she was saved. One of my favorite Christmas shows from any series is in this set and is entitled ""Together For Christmas"", as Lucy and Vivian argue over a tree. Each wants to have a tree decorated to each other's taste, so to make a compromise, they each put up a tree in the living room. They eventually have a fight and destroy the other's tree, with Lucy going so far as sawing Viv's!
 ""The Lucy Show"" is one of those rare network TV shows that never left the top 10 during its six year run on CBS. It actually finished its final season on the network in the early spring of 1968 at at whopping #2 in the Nielsens. The series would return that fall under a new title, ""Here's Lucy"", with a completey new format. ""The Lucy Show"" finished its first season at number 5, a solid hit, as the audience welcomed Lucille Ball and her co-horts into their home week after week. Important to note too is that Gale Gordon wouldn't start appearing until the following season. In the first year, a banker named My. Barnsdahl, played by character actor Charles Lane, supervised Lucy's trust fund left to her by her husband.
 The series' theme music was created and performed by Wilbur Hatch, who did the music for ""I Love Lucy"".
 Lucille Ball would go on to win two Emmy's for her role in this series in subsequent seasons, and various guest stars would pop up over the years, like Joan Crawford, Milton Berle, Carol Burnett, and Ann Southern.
 There have been a handful of ""Lucy Show"" episodes that have been put out on home video and DVD over the years, but these are the public domain shows that were never cleaned up, and they were the edited and syndicated broadcast shows that were jumpy and scratchy. These 30 shows in this boxset have been beautifully restored from the studio's 35 mm prints and come with renewed sound, and according to studio reps, they look amazing. They are also uncut.
 This boxset also comes with a new interview with Lucille Ball's daughter Lucy Arnaz, and for the first time in years Jimmy Garrett is interviewed , discussing the show and his TV mom. There are also rare commercials featuring ""The Lucy Show's"" network promos.
 If having ""The Lucy Show"" on DVD isn't enough for you, talk is ""Here's Lucy"", Lucy's 3rd series, is coming to DVD this summer too with the complete first season. ""Here's Lucy"" had a DVD release in 2004 featuring some of the best episodes during it's run, but like ""The Lucy Show"", it will be the first time that complete season boxsets will be released. I am in Heaven!
 Don't forget too that ""I Love Lucy-The Complete Series"" , is also available.
 UPDATE!!!! LUCY'S THIRD SERIES ""HERE'S LUCY"" WILL BE AVAILABLE ON DVD WITH THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON ON AUGUST 25TH, 2009!!!",1240444800,102,6263,4.588025022341376
3858254,5,B00274SIVK,"I've been a fan of ""I Love Lucy"" and Lucille Ball since I was 10.  I was completely enamored with the love story of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo. When I had found out that the actors were actually married in real life while reading their biographies, it made me fell in love with the show even more. The idea with an American woman being married to a Cuban man. Their love story being embedded in the show made it more unique and one of a kind. I had decided to buy The Lucy Show on dvd because I have never seen her other shows after ""I Love Lucy"". I told my mother and she was ecstatic. She had asked if Desi Arnaz and William Frawley were in it, and I told her no with deep regret and sadness. She quickly became disappointed. I had then reassured her that the good news is Vivian Vance is co-starring with her, in which I'm glad. I love the great chemistry between them. No amount of actors they had worked with could ever top their great friendship and teamwork! They were the best while being together. I think Lucy was very smart enough to get people on her show that she had great chemistry with. I was a bit worried that she may not like the show as much as I Love Lucy. I had popped in the dvd and I was sure in for a surprise! My mom had actually loved the show and thought it was a lot funnier than I Love Lucy! I was stunned and puzzled to hear this, but she had told me that none of the episodes of I Love Lucy had made her laughed and cried at the same time as the ones from The Lucy Show. I began to feel some sadness because it felt incomplete without seeing her ex Desi around. I was just so used to seem them as being this loving couple on tv, so it was weird for me to see her character going on actual dates. Over time, I had grew to love this show. The theme song, the stick figures in the opening credits, and even the kids themselves. They're no ""Little Ricky"", but they are pretty cute, tolerable, and funny. ""Lucy Carmichael"" isn't all that different from the ""Lucy Ricardo"" that we all know. She was just as mischievous and sneaky. Always brings disaster into everywhere she goes and brings and tags poor Viv along with her.

I still think I Love Lucy is her best show she had ever done, and it was more funnier than The Lucy Show. In my opinion, I think I Love Lucy had more funnier characters all around and none of the male characters on The Lucy Show were nearly as charming, handsome, and funny as Desi Arnaz. Maybe I just happened to always been infatuated with the Hispanic culture since I do live in South Florida were Cubans are prevalent. I think Lucy was just simply adorable in that one! She was a doll! The way that she would catered or responded to her husband endearingly and affectionately. Furthermore, I Love Lucy will always be my #1 favorite because that was the show that I had fell in love with first, had it been the other way around I probably wouldn't have been in enamored with The Lucy Show that much or felt compelled to check out Lucille Ball, but I digress. The Lucy Show is a very cute show that had some funny moments. The funniest episodes from the season, in my opinion, were ""Lucy Is A Kangaroo For A Day"", ""Lucy Visits The White House"", ""Lucy and Viv Take Up Chemistry"", ""No More Double Dates"", and ""Lucy and The Little League"". The rest were either decent or subpar. I think ""Lucy Buys A Sheep"", ""Lucy Waits Up For Chris"", and the Christmas episode were particularly good. I had enjoyed seeing the bonus features like the vintage opening and credit closings, production notes, cast commercials, and interviews with Jimmy Garrett and Lucy's daughter Lucie Arnaz. I've seen her in a few episodes and she was just too cute!  I look forward into getting more seasons from this show!

My Picks:
Lucy Waits Up For Chris
Lucy Is a Referee
Lucy Buys A Sheep
Lucy Is a Kangaroo for A Day (funniest one by FAR!)

3858285,5,B00274SIVK,"Lucille Ball had a 12-year run (1962-74) as star of two weekly series on CBS.  This is the first season of that run.  In these black-and-white episodes, Lucy plays a widow with two children who takes in her divorced friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and her son.  Many of these early episodes are family-sitcom style featuring the two families living under the same roof.

Some of these episodes are comedy classics -- ""Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower"" and ""Lucy Puts Up a TV Antenna"" --  but the season also shows that Lucy and her company were trying to find their way.  In some episodes, Lucy has a boyfriend, Harry (Dick Martin), but by the end of the season, he is gone.  Lucy and her producers seemingly decided that the Lucy character was more fun without a boyfriend.  Lucy also tangles with the banker who oversees her trust fund (Charles Lane), but he doesn't lend much in the way of comedy and he is gone by season's end also.  Over the course of the season, Lucy and other women 1) form a barbershop quartet and 2) start a volunteer fire department, but none of this takes the series anyplace.

3858311,4,B00274SIVK,"It is 1962,the cold war is on and it is the age of Camelot as President Kennedy rules the roost in the White House. In October of that year one half of televisions enduring icons,due in large part to the re-runs of their historic and still popular show ""I Love Lucy"",makes their debut in a new series. Lucille Ball returns in a new situation comedy called ""The Lucy Show"";her past partner Desi Arnaz is no where to be seen. They have been divorced two years already and Lucille is already remarried to Gary Morton,who will pop by periodically during the shows filming;making things more than a little ""awkward"" or strange on set. Desi helms the first 15 shows to get it off to as good a start as possible then,as head of the Desilu Studios,he resigns lock,stock and barrel. Lucy is forced to buy him out and she becomes only the second woman in Hollywood history,since Mary Pickford,to run a major studio. Much of the same writing staff are back along with Wilbur Hatch the musical director from the ""I Love Lucy"" days.
The public at large didn't know much of what was going on behind the scenes(they didn't have the information connections we do today) and many were hoping to see a repeat of I Love Lucy when it was first announced she was returning. The show was always in the top ten in the ratings but it was a show that was definitely not up to the standards of ""I Love Lucy"",in style and execution. The situation here had Lucy as a widow(Lucy Carmichael)with a daughter Chris(Candy Moore) and a son Jerry(Jimmy Garrett) living in a town called Danfield,N.Y.Living with them as renters was Lucy's old neighbour from ""I Love Lucy"",Vivian Vance as Vivian Bagley,a divorce' with her son Sherman(Ralph Hart).The comedy situations sprung from Lucy's interaction with her friend(s),their children and/or the bank from which she got her monthly widow's stipend. I have always contended that in every comedy team,there is a little Laurel and Hardy,and this series is no exception. Two of the funniest shows here have Lucy and Vivian trying to install a TV antenna upon the house roof ala Laurel and Hardy's in ""Hog Wild"" and the pair buying and working on an old boat to sail ala Laurel and Hardy in ""Towed in a Hole"".Lucy of course has a chance to shine many times throughout especially in the area of physical comedy,and speaking of comedy greats she even does a decent job of impersonating Charlie Chaplin in one show.
Charles Lane was long known for his dour roles in many a TV show and movie over the years and here he plays Lucy's tightwad banker. However he was only seen for a few eps and was never seen again. I think he played it too close to reality and there was only so much comedy that could be gleaned from Lucy and he on screen;the chemistry wasn't there. Also the writing many times throughout this first season was less than stellar,quite spotty in fact and more than a few eps ended in just fade outs as the action continued with no real resolution to the plots. Many of the situations are contrived and it is only through the ability and professionalism of Lucy and Vivian Vance to be able to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the comedic hat,that many of these eps are saved. It would have been very tepid even poor comedy on any other show. Watch for Dick Martin as the girls next door neighbour Harry. He would become VERY well known in a few short years on Rowan and Martin's ""Laugh In"".
In 1962 and with Lucy being,well Lucille Ball,the audience would have thought Lucy reading the New York City telephone book a great piece of entertainment;so well was she liked and loved by the audience in those days. However Lucy wasn't fooled or lulled into a false sense of security. She was a real pro and she was well aware of the shows flaws and she would set about in the coming seasons to perfect the product she was involved with. This show was in fact never meant to go beyond the first season anyways. But the raves and mail by the public showed Lucy,Desilu and ultimately CBS,just how much they wanted her back;even if it was without Desi and CBS renewed it based on that.
I based my four and a half star rating thusly:three and a half for the shows but another full star for the extras. This my friends is where this four DVD package excels. CBS has remastered and re-introduced the original film bumpers and credits for almost all the eps,like their wonderful packaging of the ""I Love Lucy"" shows. And like those,they have many other extras like interviews with some cast members,flub moments,cast biogs,production notes,photo galleries and many,many more. You can watch the shows either in the form they were seen originally or as they are repackaged for syndication today. It is beautiful to behold and again the way EVERY TV show should be released. Like ""I Love Lucy"" this series is the benchmark by which others should be judged. By the way the packaging on the outside does not mention any remastering done on these shows. I was worried about this until I got into the main menu and there is a little blurb by CBS in the extras explaining that the set WAS indeed remastered. Whew!
This may be the transplanted characters of Ethel Mertz and Lucille Ricardo but it is NOT ""I Love Lucy"" by any standard;comedy or otherwise. It IS a series still trying to find its legs though and it does have its comedic moments,thanks in large part to its two main stars Vivian Vance and Lucille Ball. A highly recommended DVD set.
Let's move on to the second season as Lucy starts to make some much needed changes. The least of which is the inclusion of Gale Gordon who will light the show up like a Christmas Tree!",1285459200,3,5628,4.567754698318496
3858312,5,B00274SIVK,It is said laughter is good for one's well-being.

3858315,5,B00274SIVK,"This collection of THE LUCY SHOW: The Official First Season:  is pure sitcom charisma based on the kaleidoscope world of Lucy Carmichael (played by the beloved Lucy Ball) as a widow raising her two children Chris (Candy Moore) and her son Jerry (Jimmy Garrett) along with her best friend ""Viv"" Vivian Bagley (played by her riot of a sidekick Vivian Vance) raising her son Sherman (Ralph Hart).

I had some of these releases on DVDs before this ""official release"" but they were extremely bad transfers (as if recorded from VHS and transferred to DVD- very shotty workmanship).  This OFFICIAL release cleaned up the transfers and beautifully restored this classic that also includes commercials that aired along with the TV Show.  (You have an option to watch with or without the commercials.) Make sure you get THIS DVD collection of ""THE LUCY SHOW: THE OFFICIAL FIRST SEASON"" or you will not get all the episodes for the season and the transfers will make you bleary-eyed and grumpy!

Some of my favorite episodes are in Season #1:  Who can forget Lucy and Viv putting up an antennae or installing a shower or better yet... when the girls are not up to mowing the lawn and purchase a sheep.  Only LUCY can come up with wild and crazy plans that go awry and keep her fans in stitches through the fabric of time!  Lucy IS timeless.  She's as funny today as she was when I was little girl watching her catastrophic antics unfold in the most amusing fashion.  So sit back, relax and get ready to bust a gut in sheer laughter as the queen of comedy is resurrected to our TV Screens as if time stood still.

THE LUCY SHOW: THE OFFICIAL FIRST SEASON DVD OFFERS: Interview with Lucy, Interview with Jimmy Garrett, Clips from Opening Night Special, Vintage Openings, Vintage Closings, Cast Commercials, Vintage Network Promos, Flubs, Cast Bios, Production notes, THE LUCY SHOW VINTAGE MERCHANDISE.

3858318,5,B00274SIVK,"Being Forty-Something gives me the priviledge of having witnessed all of the Lucy Series on regular tv; the only thing, is that I watched them all in reverse so I have a special love for the QUEEN of comedy.  Being born in the late sixties and growing up in the early seventies and eighties, the first Lucy series I ever watched was Here's Lucy because it was currently being produced and airing at that time and I immediately fell in love with the theme song and the way it came on with an animated Lucy in a top hat and tails opening the curtain to the show.  I couldn't have been more than five or six years old at the time.  I was sure not to miss an episode!!  In my pre-teen years, there were reruns of The Lucy Show, and I was captivated once again!  I was in seventh heaven and every night after the news went off at 11:30p.m. I was in front of the tv watching The Lucy Show whether I was tired in school the next day or not!!  Later in my teen years I happened to stumble across an I Love Lucy rerun, and I was on cloud nine to have another Lucy show to fall in love with.  I told my mom about it and she laughed at me and told me she already knew about I Love Lucy, so I asked her why she never told me about it knowing how much I adored Lucy.  Silly woman told me she thought I already knew about it.  After watching I Love Lucy, I opted to take Spanish in seventh grade because I wanted to know what Ricky was saying to Lucy.  Needless to say when I told my mom she looked at me like I had three heads and told me my simple uncle took it in school for the same reason!  I laughed until I cried!!  That is the love I had and still have for the Queen of Comedy!  She is by far my favorite comedianne dead or alive!  There is no one like her anywhere!!!!!  Hers is a talent that many have mimicked, but have never quite attained.  No one out there has ever been able to ascend to her level no matter how hard they've tried!  I love everything she ever played in including several old movies that she starred in, particularly ""The Long Trail"" and ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" (which I own).  Unfortunately, because I never believed in paying for television (cable tv and the like), I haven't been able to see these shows since I was a child (under 21), so I bought the Best of Here's Lucy when it came out on DVD and some of The Lucy Show collections (mostly color episodes with celebrity stars, eventhough I like the ones with Vivan Vance best) just to get a glimpse of some of the shows I remembered as a child. I bought I Love Lucy in its entirety and I will also buy Here's Lucy and The Lucy Show in its entirety! I have my favorite episodes, but I love them all!  It's a no-brainer for me and I am an African-American woman!  I even have my 22 year old and 9 year old daughters addicted to Lucy!! If you want to see comedy at its best, just remember that funny has no timeline!!  You will enjoy them as much as I and other Lucy fans do!!  I just wish my mom was alive to enjoy them with me and my children! She would be rolling on the floor laughing herself into a frenzy!  Get them!  You won't be sorry!!  If you are not a Lucy fan already, you will become one; trust me!  These shows are timeless, simply timeless and oh...so,so funny!!!",1265673600,14,3246,4.064465408805032

I grew up watching this show, when it was already in weekday reruns.  WCHS channel 8 (Charleston, W.V.) repeated ""The Lucy Show"" episodes over and over for many years.  Then it was, later, replaced by repeats of the newer ""Here's Lucy"" episodes.  And, then, after Lucille Ball sadly passed away on April 26, 1989, it seemed like the ""I Love Lucy"" episodes came back stronger than they had ever been before all over the United States.

gets better as it goes along. When the 2nd season rolls around, Charlie Lane will be replaced by Gale Gordon. Ball and Gordon had

They get into all kinds of trouble and if many of the jokes/stunts seem familiar it's because the same writing team wrote many episodes on this show.

Be on the look out for ""I Love Lucy"" actors/actresses who make appearances throughout ""The Lucy Show.""

Anyway, I was too young to watch this show when it aired, but I remember seeing re-runs every now and then, so I decided to buy the DVD set.

This is basically Lucy & Ethel in the 60s so if you're a fan of ""I Love Lucy"" then you'll probably like this series.

The DVD extras are what make this DVD set priceless:

======= EXTRAS =======

***Featurette*** ""Let's Talk To Lucie""--19:42-minutes
Interview with Lucie Arnaz, Lucille Ball's daughter, about the show and her cameo appearances as a young child.

***Vintage Promo*** ""7 Wonderful Nights""--3:22-minutes
A clip from CBS's lineup that features Lucille Ball introducing ""The Lucy Show"" sneak peek.

***Vintage Promo*** ""CBS Promo""--01:02-minutes
Another vintage promo.

***Vintage Commercial and Sponsor Spots***
These are really great because you have the option of playing them while watching the episodes, so you get a feel of what is what like when ""The Lucy Show"" aired, or you can watch them by themselves. The commercials are all very different then today's commercials and they all have something to do with the show i.e. Lucy & Vivian stick figures washing their faces with ""LUX Soap"" at the beginning of the episode. Also have the option to watch with the vintage closings.

I would say that this set is a must for Lucy and Vivian fans, and for anyone who enjoys watching vintage television shows. But other than that I think some might find the gags too similar to the ones on ""I Love Lucy"" and might not enjoy the show.",1254182400,6,2193,5.222222222222222

3858335,5,B00274SIVK,"Us Lucy fans have been waiting for a true release of this classic series in remastered glory forever.  And here it is !!  And the wait was certainly worth it.  Episodes of the series have been released in collections over the years with a disgraceful lack of remastering that left them unwatchable.  Here we have quality packaging, superb extras and more importantly all 30 episodes from Season one.  Huge kudos must be given for the tender care that was given to the packaging.  It is presented as if it is a huge gift for Lucy fans.  You can watch each episode either in its remastered glory or start it with its original airing video which includes cast members in promos for products sponsoring the show.  Great fun and as a huge Lucille Ball fan there is no Lucy memorabalia I do not want.

Now to my thoughts on the actual 1st season of THE LUCY SHOW.  I think it is amazing how Lucille Ball carried the character of Lucy onto a new series yet made her very different from Lucy Ricardo.  The Lucy character seems to be a kind hearted loving woman who gets into wacky troubles and dilemmas doing the best she can.  The character is also a natural stage for Lucille Ball to perform her comedic antics with the timing and broad range that only she has ever possessed.  When watching the first episode the viewer will be very comfortable knowing they are watching Lucy and quietly be moved onto a new Lucille Ball stage where Lucy Ricardo becomes a memory and Lucy Carmichael becomes a reality.  She is very believable as a widowed mother.  Vivian Vance's presence is a huge bonus and again Lucy and Vivian are together and just as hilarious as Lucy and Ethel but the cameraderie and relationship of Lucy Carmichael and Vivian Bagley is in no way Lucy and Ethel.  It is easy to forget the great acting they are both doing for you seamlessly accept the new characters.  And the antics are just as hilarious as with I LOVE LUICY.  There are classic episodes here such as Lucy and Viv attaching the antenna.

My favorite episode early on is Lucy is a kangaroo for a day.  She gets a job to earn money for Jerry's birthday present.  She gets a job as a secretary and center stage becomes Lucy and her comedic talents.  I was in awe , laughing hysterically at the talent of this great woman.  No performer since Lucille Ball has had the same comedic presence, gifts or aptitude to make even mere dialogue hilarious by her inflection.  To watch her use her great gifts over 30 episodes is an amazing gift.  I wait in great anticipation for the future seasons.  I highly recommend this dvd set to all Lucy fans but also to lovers of classic television.  This show is one for the history books.

Purchase, watch and enjoy over and over.",1251244800,3,2730,4.482758620689655

3858337,5,B00274SIVK,"Hi Lucy fans,

Do not hesitate in buying Season One of ""The Lucy Show""! The episodes on this collection, which was the second smash hit series Lucy did (after ""I Love Lucy""/""Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" had ended), are all extremely funny and satisfying.

Reuniting with Vivian Vance - and most of the writers from ""I Love Lucy"" (with Desi Arnaz producing the first shows of the season) - Lucy is in top form.  Many of these episodes are rarely shown these days - which is a shame. I had only watched them when Nick at Nite used to show classics, not tired shows from the 1990s.

Among the highlights on this collection: ""Lucy and Viv put in a Shower"" - which ranks among the best physical comedy bits they ever did together - ""Lucy and her Electric Matress"" (just try to keep a straight face while watching Lucy on stilts - heading right toward Viv in the boys' twin beds!) -""Lucy is a Kangaroo for a Day"" (another beloved episode) and ""Lucy Waits up for Chris"" (which culminates with Lucy jumping on a trampoline into her daughter's window).  I also really enjoyed the episodes: ""Lucy Visits the White House"" and ""Lucy the Music Lover"" - which shows Lucy struggling to stay awake on a date to the symphony.

The performances are amazing and the writing is clever and filled with credible, motivated reasons for her wild slapstick.  The last episode of the season - where Lucy and Viv buy a boat - is one of the last physical comedy triumphs for this legendary comedy team. While I loved the first series with Ricky and Fred, this sitcom in many ways develops the friendship between the two ladies even more/deeper and their work together is magic.

The episodes now look crisp and the extras (rare footage, interviews, etc.) are lots of fun too.  While nothing will ever match ""I Love Lucy"", Seasons 1-3 of ""The Lucy Show"" come close - until Viv left the series and it became Lucy, Mr. Mooney, and the guest star of the week.  Since these shows are hardly even aired, they are like new-found treasures. Trust me, you will love this purchase - and let's hope Season Two will follow soon.

3858338,5,B00274SIVK,"Everyone loves ""I Love Lucy,"" but as a child of the 1970s I remember ""The Lucy Show"" more so than Lucille Ball's iconic first series. ""The Lucy Show"" has finally been lovingly restored and officially released and the DVD set does not disappoint. The Official First Season is a treasure trove of class Lucy Carmichael and Vivian Bagley misadventures. Lucy and Viv are at their comic best as they go it alone without their former male costars (Ricky and Fred). ""The Lucy Show"" is a bit more middle America and perhaps even a tad daring as one of TV's first sitcoms to showcase a widow and a divorcee going it alone in suburbia. Of course it's all still classic Lucy antics, which are fun to watch almost 50 years later. It is also interesting to get a glimpse at TV before sitcoms were built around a single unfunny joke played over and over as today's show mostly are. ""The Lucy Show"" is classic comedy with real plot lines. Watching these episodes brought back so many classic Lucy memories I had that I never knew quite where they came from (Lucy on a horse, chasing a train...). The extras are also fantastic with original sponsor openings, classic commercials featuring the cast members, collectibles, and interviews. Lucy fans will welcome this set. And, really, aren't we all Lucy fans. I'm ready for The Official Second season now.",1250726400,7,1337,4.693617021276595
3858339,5,B00274SIVK,"After YEARS of waiting and hoping that a COMPLETE, WELL RESTORED collection of The Lucy Show season one would come out on dvd - IT IS FINALLY HERE!!!! THIS IS THE SET YOU WANT.

Forget the chopped up, poor quality dvd (and vhs) sets of the same six or seven episodes of this series that have been floating around for years. If you are a real fan of The Lucy Show (like ME!) you will enjoy the originality of this dvd release (I have LOVED The Lucy Show since I first watched it in local reruns when I was growing up in the 1970s).

In The Lucy Show tv series, Lucy is Lucy Carmichael and Vivian Vance is Vivian (""Viv"") Bagley. They are two single mothers (Lucy a widow and Viv a divorcee) raising three kids between them. The situations are truly funny and the exchange of lines between Lucy and Viv are just as funny as they were in the previous old I Love Lucy series - but now it's the 1960s and they are NOT Ricardo and Mertz anymore - the ladies are now living in suburban Danfield, with new names, new personas, new hair dos and no husbands!  I have always loved the transition that Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance made into Lucy Carmichael and Vivian Bagley. The Lucy Show was based on the wonderful book ""Life Without George"" by Irene Kampen and if you've read the book, as I have, you will see a marvelous adaption of it on The Lucy Show (and of course Lucy's expert physical comedy is a treat that you will not find in the book!). The great character actress, Mary Jane Croft, is in several episodes. She is really lovely and her character fits in so well with Lucy and Viv.

All the episodes in season one, 1962-63, are in classic, glorious black & white, the video quality is excellent and the audio is really quite perfect. Lucille Ball was a perfectionist and I bet she'd be happy to know that this dvd set was obviously lovingly restored and there are many extra features not previuosly seen since they first aired.

NEXT...PLEASE release the second season of The Lucy Show soon! There are many great episodes from the second season as well. And in the second season, 1963-64, we will get to see Lucy Carmichael and Vivian Bagley and the rest of the gang from Danfield in COLOR!!",1250726400,8,2192,4.375921375921376

Shortly after the very last episode ""Lucy Meets the Mustache"", with Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams, was filmed, Lucille Ball filed for divorce from Desi Arnaz.
  Lucy came back to CBS with a new tv series, The Lucy Show (1962-68).  Vivian Vance also returns to help Lucy in her new show. She stayed for 3 seasons.
  Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball never appeared in a tv series again, but Desi was their on the set as ""executive producer"".

  Lucy played a widow ""Lucy Carmichael"" who had a teenage daughter, Chris (Candy Moore) and a young son Jerry (Jimmy Garrett).  Vivian Vance played a divorced woman, ""Vivian Bagley"" with one son, Sherman (Ralph Hart). They live together in the same house.
  The first season is in black & white.  While some stories seem to be a re-write from the ""I Love Lucy"" days (same writers), scenarios start to become more original as the season progresses.
  Don't expect the silly, yet elegant ""Lucy Richardo"" in this series. While their  still are the trademarks, Lucille Ball seems to be more bossy and grabby towards ""Viv"". Lucy is at times like William Frawley's ""Fred"", except her hair is more grown out.

He would later make a special appearance on ""The Lucy Show"" in Season 4.
  Ralph Hart is a cheerful boy with a talent for dance.
  Jimmy Garrett, with his mature child voice, is also a darling on the show. You might remember him from ""The Twilight Zone"" episode, ""The Bewitching Pool"".

3858342,5,B00274SIVK,"I have just finished viewing ""THE LUCY SHOW:  The Official First Season"" and I am very pleased.  It is wonderful to have these hilarious first 30 episodes in a great DVD collection.  The extras are very cool.  The 16mm films of the original openings and closings, that you can watch with the actual episodes, makes it a lot of fun to view in the ""vintage"" mode.  The ""normal"" mode is very smooth with the ending of the opening titles being re-edited with the last two notes of the theme instead of Roy Rowan saying ""THE LUCY SHOW is brought to you by...""  The same goes for the little bowing segment at the end of the show, which had him saying ""THE LUCY SHOW was brought to you by...""  The picture quality is wonderful and as well as the audio quality.  There are some fluctuations in the sound on some episodes, but not enough to really upset the overall feel of the shows.  The editing on the commercial breaks on a large number of episodes is a little annoying.  I suspect the ends and beginnings were cut a little short in the transferring process and that's why they decided to do some fast muting to make it sound as smooth as they could; sometimes they fade out the music gradually instead of using the muting method.  Technically, this is disappointing, but the overall enjoyment of the show is grade A.  Hopefully, they will correct these oversights in the subsequent seasons, which I am sure will be released very soon.  I am also looking forward to the release of the first season of HERE'S LUCY on August 25, as well as THE MOTHERS-IN-LAW later this year.  Thank you CBS for finally releasing THE LUCY SHOW, a true classic, that hopefully new generations will grow to love as much as we have.",1249344000,6,1705,4.475728155339806
3858343,5,B00274SIVK,"I am glad to see this on DVD. I remember watching this show as a kid and I really loved it. But, I only loved the early ones with Vivian Vance, when they were in New York. In my opinion, the show tanked when Vance left the series and it was moved to California.

The first seasons were of the same caliber as I Love Lucy, one of my all time favorite TV shows, and Ball's character was similar to Lucy Ricardo. When it moved to California, the character of Lucy Carmichael became stupid, something she never was before.

So, I say get this one and the next season or so that are set in New York, but don't bother with the rest. As the saying has it, the show jumped the shark when they moved it to California and dropped Vance from the show.

UPDATE 3/25/10:

I retract what I said about not buying the California seasons. I doubt I am solely responsible, but they have evidently decided not to put out seasons 2 and 3, or any later.

It was then that my love affair with Lucille Ball, and the equally talented Vivian Vance, began.  By 1980, the show was off but my memories of ""The Lucy Show"" continued.  Despite this series being aired on Nick at Nite and TV Land in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I had not seen ""The Lucy Show"" in almost thirty years.  Since then, I have seen countless reruns of ""I Love Lucy"", but I feel Lucy and Viv were at their best in ""The Lucy Show"".  The first season of ""The Lucy Show"" is definitely Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance's showcase.  These two women were as good as Laurel & Hardy and paved the way for Laverne & Shirley and other female comedy duos after them.  Of all the series on DVD today, even Lucy's other series, I am thrilled and relieved that ""The Lucy Show"" is finally on DVD.  As time goes on, and so many great series of yesteryear fade away to make room for today's sitcoms in syndication, to know that I can watch ""The Lucy Show"" any time on DVD is a Godsend.  Lucille Ball is the greatest comedienne of our time; Vivian Vance is the greatest second banana, and with this series on DVD, we can see why any time we want, over and over again.

Like many others, I have been waiting a long time to see this series on DVD. I am too young to have seen it originally and only have vague memories of seeing the color episodes in re-runs. So I have really only seen the poor quality public domain episodes.

CBS took its time releasing season one, but it was worth the wait. The episodes look and sound fantastic. The shows have been beautifully transferred, complete and uncut, from the original film elements and are crystal clear. The sound is clean and clear. You can watch with the original vintage openings, closings and commercials, which really adds to the experience.

The only thing I can complain about is the packaging, which has a slightly cheap look. I would have made it a bit nicer to distinguish it from the public domain sets and to showcase its high quality.

The shows themselves are a bit dated and don't quite have the special magic of I Love Lucy (and what could?), but Lucy and Viv are a joy to watch. After the first few episodes it really hits its stride and there are some great physical comedy bits. I am really enjoying finally getting to see these episodes, especially the first 15 produced by Desi Arnaz.

Kudos to the team that put this set together. It was done with care and respect for both Lucy and the fans. I couldn't be happier.

Tom Watson and crew who worked on this deserve large pats on the back for their excellent work.  With all this positive feedback being received, I hope Paramount has Season 2 ready to roll.  Bravo!!

Back in the early 90's when Nick At Nite aired this series I recorded it on VHS and have watched & rewatched these episodes over & over again. I purchased the 30 public domain episodes that had been put out over and over again on DVD. But, still I longed to have this entire series on DVD from episode 1 all the way through episode 156 and now we are finally on the way with the release of Season 1 which has been beautifully remastered.

Aside from the episodes themselves, which run around 26 minutes not the 22 or so minutes we find on syndicated prints, the bonus material is superior. Where possible the original openings, closings & cast commercials that were used during the original broadcasts are included as bonus material. Or if you prefer you can chose to watch each episode with or without this Vintage material included (I prefer to watch with the Vintage material included).

The interviews with Lucie Arnaz & Jimmy Garrett are wonderful. Tony Maietta was the perfect choice to do these on screen interviews. He obviously loves his subject (in this case Lucy) and was knowledgeable about her and the show. At one point Lucie Arnaz commented on the amount of knowledge he had. But he accomplishes this without coming across as gushing.

Though I love this entire series the first three seasons with Viv & the kids are by far my favorite. With season 1 being the best of the whole series in my opinion. Lucy & Viv Put in a Shower, Lucy & Her Electric Mattress & Lucy Puts Up A TV Antenna are just a few examples of how great these ladies were together.

This set is a must have for every Lucy fan. CBS Home Entertainment has hit another homerun with this release. I could not be more pleased and eagerly await the release of Season 2.",1248393600,8,1908,4.474137931034483

Every episode is in perfect condition and uncut,"" but then gave it a one-star rating, consequently lowering the overall rating from five stars.  Obviously this was an error, or R. Brinkman did not understand the rating system.  But truthfully, what R. Brinkman WROTE was right on.  The episodes of this series that were produced during its first season stand as some of the best work in Lucille Ball's career; her famous comic timing is in full bloom here.  And personally, I think Vivian Vance rises to her equal, and is given some biting lines that Vance delivers in a delicious way that no one else could, lines that might have made Ethel Mertz blush. To me, Vivian Vance is funnier in this series than she was ever allowed to be on ""I Love Lucy.""  Clearly, the absence of Fred and (especially) Ricky is palpable at times, but this new version of Ethel, in the person of Vivian Bagley, does a lot to fill that void.  And the quality of the scripts and direction is up to par with the predecessor series, which is not surprising given that the ""I Love Lucy"" writers are on hand, and so was Desi Arnaz who, as executive producer, got the series launched and seemed to have gone out of his way to make sure everything was perfect.

Towards the end of ""I Love Lucy"" writers fatigue began to set in as every conceivable marital situation seemed to have been addressed.  This new format allowed the writers to explore new territory, which sometimes pitted Lucy and Viv against one another in a way that would not have been possible in the ""I Love Lucy"" format; e.g., competing against each other for dates.  All in all, this was an excellent season, in my opinion better than the first and sixth seasons of ""I Love Lucy,"" certainly better than the Lucy-Desi hours, and possibly on par with the third and fifth seasons of ""I Love Lucy.""  The first handful of episodes range from funny to very funny.  But by the eighth episode (""Lucy Is a Kangaroo for a Day"") it takes off with a string of hilarious episodes.

Other than the quality of the episodes, the producers of this DVD set have to really be commended.  Each uncut episode is crystal clear, ideal for HD TV.  And they went way out of their way with the cute menus and graphics, and wonderful bonuses, which include footage from a long-lost special, interesting production notes, wonderful interviews with Lucie Arnaz and Jimmy Garrett, a wonderful optional feature that allows you to watch the episodes with the original company sponsor openings and closings and cast commercials, and more.  In short, you cannot go wrong with this DVD set.  It's most definitely worth every penny.",1248307200,7,2785,4.607287449392713

(CBS Home Video, 2009)
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the first season of Lucille Ball's second sitcom series, CBS's ""The Lucy Show,"" which first aired in 1962 and ran until 1968. The first season was shot in black-and-white; the other seasons were all in color.

It's a curious cultural artifact: decades before Rosanne portrayed a salt-of-the-earth suburban mom, or Candace Bergen scandalized Dan Qualye's delicate sensibilities by playing a single mom with a child born out of wedlock, here was Lucy, as a widowed single mother raising two kids while also in a co-housing arrangement with her friend Vivian (played by Vivian Vance, who had played Ethel on ""I Love Lucy"") who is a divorcee with a son of her own. The pilot episode doesn't explain the situation, it just shows it: the two women live together and are fine with it. Neither seems to have a job, but they seem to have enough money, even though they often scrimp to make ends meet, and finally, while they are sometimes a little ""boy crazy"" (looking for dates, etc.) they don't seem to be in a big hurry to remarry.

It's a surprisingly modern outlook, and it is interesting to see how the show presents these two independent women. Although some of the episodes revolve around their attempts to master the masculine world (Lucy doing home repairs, Lucy trying to referee her son's football game) the male characters in the show are generally pretty accepting of the women's untraditional arrangement. The men are helpful and solicitious, but not condescending or controlling.  (Particularly welcome is the presence of '60s TV stalwart Dick Martin, as Lucy's neighbor Harry, always a favorite actor of mine...)

In dramatic and artistic terms, the show is well produced. After a decade working together on ""I Love Lucy,"" the duo of Ball and Vance is a well-oiled machine, almost a like vaudeville duo who know each other's timing and thought processes inside and out. The show revolves around their pitch-perfect performances and the plots echo the kookiness and mayhem of the first ""Lucy"" series, although with a more mature feel overall. This Lucy is an older, more world-wise character than before; where Lucy Ricardo was a barely-adult wild child, Lucille Carmichael is a grownup, taking care of her family while navigating the sometimes choppy waters of her own life. She still breaks into other people's apartments and dresses up in kangaroo suits and gets herself into all kinds of crazy fixes, but she does it with such... poise.  Fans of Lucy's work will be thrilled to see this show finally back in circulation after all these years -- and it's a fine chance to see some well-crafted classic TV, '60s style.  Highly recommended!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)",1248307200,5,2822,5.042918454935623
3858357,1,B00274SIVK,"Definitely do not pass up this one.  CBS/Paramount has outdone themselves with this DVD set.  Every episode is in perfect condition and uncut.  One correction to an earlier review:  The Lucy Show was actually being broadcast on RTN (the Retro Television Network) until last year when all the Paramount series were pulled from the network, and then they were only showing the color seasons (Season 2 on), so it's nice to see the black and white ones again after so long.  Now let's hope we get to see the color seasons on DVD... The color quality on these was really superb on RTN, so one can only hope.",1248307200,4,602,4.537037037037037
3858358,5,B00274SIVK,"I can still vividly remember watching Nick at Nite and catching hilarious episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" Then in 1996, the show was taken off the network and has not been broadcasted regularly on national television since. The only other time ""The Lucy Show"" was aired on television after 1996 was in 2004 when TV Land aired an episode apart of it's ""TV Land Moguls"" special. From the time Nick at Nite took this show off its channel to the present time, I have wanted ""The Lucy Show"" to receive some sort of special treatment and not be tossed into the shadow of ""I Love Lucy."" Anyway, the time has come when ""The Lucy Show"" gets the treatment it deserves! This DVD set of the first season is absolutely incredible! The episodes are restored with beautiful crystal clear images. I cannot applaud CBS/Paramount for giving this show the proper due it deserves! This first season is just as funny as anything done on ""I Love Lucy."" And it's so great to Lucy and Viv together again. The chemistry is almost stronger than it was in ""I Love Lucy.""

Buy this collection! You will not be disappointed!!",1248220800,5,1093,4.576530612244898
3858359,5,B00274SIVK,"I bought this yesterday, the first day it was available.  And though the previous reviewers reviewed it solely on what they about the first season, rather than what was actually presented in the DVD set, they were right.  There is no disputing that this season of The Lucy Show is the best season.  Still working with her original writers from the I Love Lucy days, Desi Arnaz (during the first part of the season), and Vivian Vance, there is no wonder why this season is so great!  Since others have already talked about what the season contains, I'd like to say what the DVD contains.  The interviews with Jimmy Garrett and Lucie Arnaz are fantastic.  The bonus materials on the discs are a lot like the I Love Lucy discs with flubs, bios, extra material, original openings, etc.  Seeing these shows for the first time uncut was a joy to watch!  A lot of the humor in these shows were so subtle and yet so funny, something Lucille Ball lost in her humor in her later years

So it goes without saying this is a must for anyone's Lucy or classic TV collection.  CBS has done a fine job at restoring the episodes and it truly demonstrates why Lucille Ball was the queen of TV comedy.  And it is wonderful to see Vivian in a big role, as her role greatly diminshed in the second and third seasons of the show.  Thanks CBS!",1248220800,7,1320,4.386831275720165
3858360,5,B00274SIVK,"You know, for years I was wondering if we would ever see 'The Lucy Show' on DVD as official season sets, obviously there are/were cheap public domain copies, of which are quite impossible to watch, I was suckered into buying a couple of them, but when I heard that people were sending loads of requests to CBS/Paramount to release this, they finally took notice as to how many people, myself included wanted these shows to be released officially, and they have been, and this particular season has all 30 episodes of the first season all restored and remastered, so lets dive into this more.

First off, the packaging is one of my favorite types of packaging for box sets, the hard clear plastic case, and the 4 DVD's inside that sit in two flippers, two discs on each flipper, and the episode list printed right inside, so right when you open the box, you see all the episodes listed with the original air dates, very nice, and then once you get into the DVD's, and start watching them, you will see how much of a beautiful job they've done with this set, the picture and audio are clear and crisp, most of the tears and grain have been removed from the picture, which is really amazing considering how old this show is, and you get a nice load of bonus features such as Flubs, original Billboards, a new interview with Lucille Ball's daughter 'Lucy Arnaz' who of course appeared with her mother and brother in the following series 'Here's Lucy', a new interview with Jimmy Garrett, original clips from opening night, vintage openings and closings in which you can watch all the episodes with or without the original sponsor openings, a menu will come up when you select an episode, and you simply choose either 'Vintage' which is of course the original sponsor openings, or remastered, very nice touch, and you also get the original cast commercials which ended the shows with more sponsor names.

And there's many great episodes found in this season as well such as, the series premier 'Lucy Waits up For Chris' as she tries to sneak back into her bedroom window by jumping on a trampaleen outside, 'Lucy Is a Referee' which features young Desi Arnaz Jr. and Lucy Arnaz, 'Lucy Misplaces 2,000 Dollars' 'Lucy Buys a Sheep' 'Lucy Becomes an Astronaut' 'Lucy is a Kangaroo For A Day' 'Lucy Puts Up A TV Antenna' 'Vivian Sues Lucy' 'Lucy and Her Electric Mattress' 'Together For Christmas' 'and the infamous 'Lucy And Viv Put In A Shower' 'Lucy and Viv Become Tycoons' 'Lucy Visits The White House' 'Lucy Buys a Boat'.

So yeah, you could say that this series got off to a great start, all of the episodes are good, but I find the ones I mentioned to be the best ones, so if you've been waiting to get 'The Lucy Show' on DVD for a longtime, this is your set, it's worth every penny, and as of now, CBS/Paramount has released seasons 2 and 3, so I would say this is quite the popular set, because CBS/Paramount said that if they saw this season sold well, they would keep releasing the following seasons, so since they have out up to season 3, I would say they are pleased with the sales, and liked all the good reviews they got, so get in on the act so we can enjoy all 6 seasons!",1248220800,8,3179,4.496539792387543
3858361,5,B00274SIVK,"Well Im only 39 but let me tell you growing up I would watch reruns of The Lucy Show and it is by far the greatest show Lucille Ball did in my mind. The shower scene where lucy And Vivian Vance try making a walk in shower is just fantastic.im so glad to see this show finally out so i can get rid of all the public domain shows that i own of this show. Now to get a great price on this set. By the way CBS has apparently taken the video from 35mm prints which give each episode so much more depth its fantastic. The feature where you can actually watch each episode just under 26 minutes each with originals bumpers and endings,CBS took there time and apparently did a fantastic tribute to Lucille Ball and The very underated Vivian Vance. PS. Look for the episode where Lucy and Viv meet a janitor in one of the episodes and when he turns around its William Frawley,Fred from I LOve Lucy.who at this time was doing the role of Uncle Bubb on My Three Sons.",1246924800,2,956,4.145161290322581
3858362,5,B00274SIVK,"I remember this from re-runs in the early-mid 70's. I loved it and since DVDs came in, wondered why this wasn't available on DVD. This show was so much fun to watch and glad to see it finally here! Why are there so many crumby movies and shows on DVD and so few of these great ones?! Can't wait for the season/episode with Joan Crawford playing herself and saying she didn't need Hollywood or money when she desperately needed both in real life! Too funny! What season was the episode anyway?",1245628800,2,492,4.417582417582418
3858363,5,B00274SIVK,"""The Lucy Show: the First Official Season"" comes in a plastic case. The plastic case has exactly the same cover art as the paper sleeve which fits over the plastic case.  Each of the four discs are listed on the inside panel of the case, along with the titles of each episode. The episodes are distributed across four discs.  The discs are one-sided, and the front side is gray with ""The Lucy Show"" logo at the top. Stylisticly, the menus on each disc are quite similar to the design found on the ""I Love Lucy"" discs. Also inside is an insert advertising the season one release of ""Here's Lucy"", as well as ""The Lucille Ball Specials"". ""The Lucy Show"" was based on Irene Kampen's novel, ""Life Without George"".  Kampen's novel was about her recent divorce, but in ""The Lucy Show"", Lucille Ball plays Lucy Carmichael, a widow; and her housemate and sidekick, Vivian Vance plays the divorcee, Vivian Bagley.  The stories, particularly in the first seasons, revolve around two single women, living together, raising their families without a man---pretty unconventional for an early 60's sitcom, and especially daring for Lucille Ball since she and Desi Arnaz were the epitome of marital bliss in the 1950's. In its freshman season, ""The Lucy Show"" reunites many from the crew of ""I Love Lucy"", and its quickly evident that the team had not lost its touch.  Veteran Lucy writers, Bob Carroll, Jr. Madelyn Pugh, and Jess Oppenheimer often said that in writing for ""I Love Lucy"" each script had to start with a logical premise; in other words the audience had to believe that the beginning concept was plausible. From there, the writers argued that you could take the audience wherever you wanted to go. ""The Lucy Show"", particularly during the early seasons, carries that concept forward, and the result was strong scripts, exceptional performances, and many, many laughs.",1242000000,10,1866,4.8924050632911396
3858364,5,B00274SIVK,"I am so glad that The Lucy Show's first season is finally being released.  I'm in my early 50s and was too young to watch the series when it premiered, but I've watched it countless times in reruns. Lucille Ball was one of the great comedic talents, and she reached her height in this series.  No longer having to play second fiddle to a less talented husband, she was in her element as a widow with two children sharing her house with a divorced friend.  Vivian Vance also blossomed in this series when she was no longer tied to a husband figure.

Two women with children and without husbands were not the perceived norm in the early 1960s so The Lucy Show had a slightly controversial feel to it when it premiered.  But everybody loved Lucy, of course, and so any resistance there might have been quickly evaporated.

The first season of The Lucy Show featured quite a bit of physical comedy in the form of ""stunts"" by Lucy and Vivian.  The shower installation episode is a classic, but equally funny is an episode in which the women put up an antenna on their roof.  There's also a poignant episode featuring a trip to Washington for a visit with President Kennedy which ends, if I remember correctly, with a very good impersonation of the President's voice from off stage.  All of the first season episodes are in black and white, making for a nice link with I Love Lucy.

It will be a pleasure to see the complete first season of The Lucy Show shown in as close to its original format as possible.  I have already pre-ordered it, and hope to be able to collect the following seasons soon.",1241654400,9,1593,4.458620689655173
3858365,5,B00274SIVK,"I can't remember how many years ago it was when I wrote, emailed and called CBS Home Entertainment to beg for them to release THE LUCY SHOW on DVD. I will tell you that I will always remember how shocked I was when I just received an email from CBS telling me they are releasing The Lucy Show's First Season on July 21, 2009! I found that begging CBS does pay, when it comes to wanting the BEST classic television shows released, and THE LUCY SHOW is THE BEST! The personal letter CBS wrote me stated that they have remastered The Lucy Show using the original 35 mm negative for a virtually flawless reproduction on dvd!!! I am so happy- FLAWLESS! I've been watching those horrible, blurred and faded versions on dvd for years! CBS said that if sales are good for this set, they will be remastering THE LUCY SHOW SEASON 2 IN FLAWLESS COLOR!!! So, to everyone who loves THE LUCY SHOW- order now!! THE LUCY SHOW ran for 6 seasons, so we only need 5 more! HERE'S LUCY SEASON ONE is also in the making from MPI Home Video and that show ran for 6 Seasons as well. After so many years of waiting, this is just like a dream come true for LUCY fans like me!

THE LUCY SHOW premiered on October 1, 1962 on CBS.  The show began with Lucille Ball as Lucy Carmichael, a widow with two children, Chris (Candy Moore), and Jerry (Jimmy Garrett), living in Danfield, Connecticut, sharing her home with divorced friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and her son, Sherman (Ralph Hart). Lucy had been left with a substantial trust fund by her late husband, which was managed during this first season by local banker Mr. Barnsdahl (Charles Lane). At the beginning of the 1963-64 season, the character was replaced by Theodore J. Mooney (Gale Gordon, who would remain with the series for the remainder of its run, despite the format change).

This First Season also featured in recurring roles, Harry Connors (Dick Martin), Audrey Simmons (Mary Jane Croft), Eddie Collins (Don Briggs), Thelma Green (Carole Cook) and Dorothy Boyer (Dorothy Konrad). Lucy's little, adorable real life children, Lucie Arnaz age 11 and Desi Arnaz Jr. age 9 make their first television appearances in a few of these first season's episodes.

Lucie Arnaz talks about these first appearances in the wonderful Bonus interview she does for this dvd set. I never knew that when watching the episode, LUCY AND VIV PUT IN A SHOWER when I was a little girl back in the 60's, that Lucy was actually drowning when she was down under the water, and couldn't pull herself up. Vivian thought Lucy was under water way too long and reached down to pull her up- literally saving Lucy's life. The cameras kept rolling and no one in the studio or audience knew what was really going on! It is just so fitting that CBS took the time to make this show flawless, just as Lucy and Vivian's performances were for all the years they worked together!

Here are the 30 Episodes from Season One, which also include in this long awaited set many fabulous special features:
1. (1 Oct 62) LUCY WAITS UP FOR CHRIS
2. (8 Oct 62) LUCY DIGS UP A DATE

Lucy and Viv sparkle and shine in this follow up series and as other reviewers have pointed out, some of their best work is HERE and not just I Love Lucy. I'm hoping all Lucy fans come out and support this release. Anyone who bought the public domain releases and were disappointed needs to give this series another try with season 1. The first three years with Vivian Vance are vastly SUPERIOR to the last three years set in Hollywood, which probably gave many casual viewers a bad impression of Lucy's post-I Love Lucy work. I'm hoping CBS will be shocked by the great sales of this season and immediately work on putting seasons 2 and 3 out promptly! We lifelong fans of Lucy deserve to have all of her work made available to us. :)",1241136000,5,822,4.4144736842105265
3858367,5,B00274SIVK,"FINALLY, Lucy's second TV series will be out on July 21st.  I already pre-ordered my copy and can't wait to see all 30 episodes from season one.  ""The Lucy Show"" was on of CBS' top shows during its six-year run.  It never was out of the Top 10 and finished its final season in second place with a 27.0 rating just 0.6 tenths of a point behind ""The Andy Griffith Show.""  This series truly established Lucille Ball as the Queen of Comedy and First Lady of Television.  She earned 4 Emmy nominations and two wins (1966-67 and 1967-68) for Best Actress In A Leading Role In A Comedy Series.  The series has been overshadowed by her first phenomenal TV series ""I Love Lucy,"" but it is just as good and some episodes are even better.  Some classic episodes in season one include Lucy and Viv putting up a TV antenna, installing a shower, practicing karate, a Christmas show which has Lucy and Ethel destroying each others Christmas tree and Lucy doing a Charlie Chaplin imitation.  ""The Lucy Show"" is one of the best written comedy series of all-time.  I'm glad that CBS/Paramount Home Entertainment listened to all the fans' letters, e-mails and telephone calls requesting a release on DVD.  Seasons two through six were filmed in color and I look forward for their release in season sets like MPI Home Video is doing with Lucy's third series ""Here's Lucy"" (first season expected sometime in summer).  To put it simply, ""The Lucy Show"" is a true classic comedy and anyone whos buys this series will not be disappointed.  Till this day, there is no greater comedy team than Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance.  After Vivian left the show in 1965 Lucy moved to California and worked for Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).  These shows are known as the California years with big name guest stars, i.e. John Wayne, Carol Burnett, Danny Thomas, Joan Crawford, etc. These shows are equally funny and there are many classic episodes including a take-off on ""The Untouchables,"" Lucy getting drafted, and an episode with Dean Martin, which I read was Lucy's favorite episode of ""The Lucy Show.""

It's time to pre-order this series to get it to climb the Amazon charts in hopes that we can get a TOP 25 rating by the release date of July 21, 2009.  I think this would virtually assure us that CBS will release the rest of the seasons on DVD.  Pre-order today!
