8557620,5,B00ATLP9G0,"What a bargain! This boxed set was full of unexpected surprises. Firstly there are two versions of the pilot. The original which was 60 minutes put a different twist on the story and I must say I enjoyed it very much. Similar to the version that aired but different enough to make it interesting. The second version is 90 minutes and it is the one we have seen on TV.

Both the Robert Downey movies are included which caught me by surprise!

No product information so you have to guess what you will see next but it all makes sense once you work it out.

The set also includes a lot of behind the scenes footage which was also interesting and added value.

Can't wait for the next season!",1362355200,2,688,4.310077519379845
8557621,4,B00ATLP9G0,"I bought this DVD set because it includes both season one and two. I opted for this Chinese import because it was somewhat cheaper. Season two is/was only available in Blue Ray (Season two now appears to be available on DVD on Amazon; I could not find it previously). I have a Blue Ray player, but financially decided on the DVD set. There are three episodes per season. Though not indicated; absolutely no content information provided, both of the Robert Downey movies are included. Disc one through three and clearly formatted with Chinese subtitles, which can be removed once the program starts. Disc four is a modified remake of episode one with a few different characters and sequencing. I can't explain this. I suspect the pilot was varied for a different audience, or region. Disc five through ten is formatted in a `standard' fashion, as if produced for English speaking regions. As well, Disc four through ten plays louder, necessitating a reduction in the volume control.  Disc five is the first Robert Downey version of Sherlock Holmes. I believe disc six through eight cover the second season of ""Sherlock.""  I think that disc nine and ten cover the second Robert Downey movie. Surprisingly every disc has the picture of Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson from the BBC production; no indication whatsoever of the Robert Downey version. Further, there are no `bonus' features, even though one of the Disc has a selection of bonus items, when selected do not function. Though not desirable, these discrepancies are not a major problem once you realize how they did it. No doubt, the background features, (bonus information), were not only anticipated, but are highly desirable. Not knowing any better at the time I expected each Disc represented an individual episode. No information suggested otherwise. I'm surprised the DVD set totally lacks any content information. In retrospect, I would have probably `waited' for the second season DVD version and purchased it with the first season DVD version, so as to secure the bonus features. Of course, the inclusion of the Robert Downey version largely offsets this lack. In short, I am still well satisfied, though with the inclusion of complete content information I could have made a more informed decision. Why this lack of information from the like of Amazon? True, if I had purchased, and wanted season one and two of Sherlock, plus the two Robert Downey movies, the cost would have been substantially more. Still, with the complete content information I could have made an informed decision. Please note; the DVD quality is very good, with the `minor' fluctuation in the sound dynamics after Disc three. I selected four stars because of the lack of content information, and therefore the inability to know precisely what I was ordering. The results happen to turn out favorably. Even so, and understandably, I would have preferred to know the exact content of that which I am ordering.",1361318400,9,2948,5.002036659877801
