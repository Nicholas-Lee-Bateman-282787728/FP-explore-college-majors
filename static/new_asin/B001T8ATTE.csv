3788566,5,B001T8ATTE,"First of all, I'd just like to clear up that this is NOT the tv series that is airing right now (as of August 2011). The tv series is in fact called ""How the states got their shapes"" and is hosted by Bryan Unger, THIS series is a different version of that same concept, just no host. There is a narrator and there are no clips of Bryan interviewing residents of each state. I'm not saying this is good or bad, just want other people to know that they aren't buying the tv series. I suppose that will come out on DVD next year after the first season has run.

With that out of the way, this is a great series. It has a lot of history that people have generally forgot about or just simply were never taught. I've showed this to a lot of my friends and there are constant comments ""huh I never knew that"". I could see this would be great for parents looking for something to further their child's education from school. I know that US history is a part of the curriculum so this is a great way to learn!",1312848000,,1001,4.107142857142857
3788567,3,B001T8ATTE,The dvds were informative but the condition of their package was a mess. Every dvd container was broken and I had to buy a new one to put them in.,1310083200,,146,3.9
3788568,5,B001T8ATTE,"I started watching these on the History Channel and I was hooked.  I found the set on Amazon and now I still can't get enough. These are great for kids to enjoy as well.  I travel all over the US on my motorcycle and it is so nice to see some of the things on this video that I've seen before and say ""hey I've been there"".....and also for the places I have not seen it's great to have this so I can say ""hey I really MUST go there on my next trip!""  You can't beat this set of videos.",1285632000,4,485,3.782178217821782
3788569,5,B001T8ATTE,I have this friend in Germany who has been an e-mail buddy for a long time. I am sending this set to them so they can appreciate seeing America before coming over here to live,1278028800,2,175,4.0285714285714285
3788570,5,B001T8ATTE,"OK, first let me say that this is an entertaining and informative series with interesting tidbits about each of our nation's fifty states!

They open each of the fifty segments showing a postage stamp with ""Greetings from...(insert state name here),"" followed by the state's flag, followed by pertinent info about the state in question.  Except that when they intro Washington on disk two, THAT'S NOT THE WASHINGTON STATE FLAG!!!  They actually show the Washington, D.C. flag instead!

Yes, it's a minor error, but Washington state and Washington, D.C. are not the same thing!

Otherwise, this is a truly enjoyable series and I highly recommend it!",1274918400,6,648,5.133333333333334
3788571,5,B001T8ATTE,"If you want to be entertained and get an education at the same time, the History Channel provides both when they're not talking about how Nostrodamus foresaw space aliens who left behind a cloth with an image of Jesus in desert space #54, or some other such drivel.  In this case, it's about our fifty states, providing a geography lesson, hours of light entertainment, and just plain fun information.

In three DVD's, you get four states per hour devoted to the images, nickname, background, customs, dishes, climate, sports, and main products of each state. Of course they tell you the size and population in relation to others, when it came into the union, and its capital, which most Americans probably don't know to begin with.  Along the way, I learn about the lobster of Maine and the autumn of Vermont, that California has the highest terrain above sea level and lowest terrain level below the sea in the country, the Gateway to the West in St. Louis, the state that gave us the most presidents and the fewest, moonshine in West Virginia, the freezing temperatures of Minnesota, and Cajun cooking. (I can almost taste the Tabasco)!

I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn geography and is between the ages of 8 and 68. It is one of these light entertainment stories that kept me glued to the boob tube. The DVD's allow me to see them at my leisure, when I want to see them. And of course, I can hit the back X2 button for anything I missed or want to hear or see again.

I bought this and ""The Presidents,"" also from the History Channel, for approximately $35.00.

Aloha!",1239753600,22,1587,4.590106007067138
8340799,3,B001T8ATTE,We homeschool and thought this would be a great way to learn about each state. I so far have liked what he does about each state. The only negative is for one state it talks about a few topics that are not young child appropriate.,1498262400,,230,4.133333333333334

8340804,5,B001T8ATTE,"This is a really neat collection of the cool things about each state.  I have often thought that I would take a tour around the country and stop for a bit in each state.  Other than some of the larger and most popular ones, I have not had a chance to do this.  This is great for those of us who would like to do this but have not gotten around to it.",1386720000,,350,3.767123287671233
8340805,5,B001T8ATTE,This was given to my husband as a Christmas gift.  He has been watching it and keeps on making comments on what he has learned from it!  Looks like it's a keeper!,1358640000,,162,4.03125
8340806,4,B001T8ATTE,"We purchased this DVD set to take on a trip out west. Every time we crossed the line into another state we'd turn the DVD on about that state. It was really interesting & informative. The kids really enjoyed it (even the younger ones). Each state has approx. 10-20 min. about it. It's a narrative with interviews, pictures, lots of facts, etc. I would highly recommend it!",1344643200,,372,4.567164179104478
8340807,5,B001T8ATTE,this DVD was extremely informative.  It told a lot of things that I didn't know.  Even about my own state.....I would say you should get this DVD....................,1323734400,,165,5.074074074074074
8340808,5,B001T8ATTE,"I am an 8th grade social studies teacher, and one of my standards to teach from has to do with knowning the 50 United States. This was a great item to have the kids enjoyed the video and it was easy to use when I was absent or had a shortened day. Each state is short os even if it is a shortened class period you can always get though at least one.",1317945600,,349,3.7945205479452055
