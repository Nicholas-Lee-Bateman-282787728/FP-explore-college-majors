8207695,3,B000T47INO,"This is a short and interesting color Education Documentary, made in 1950 about the PUEBIO INDIANS and their land. We also get to see PUEBLO Paintings, and are shown many of their lovely handmade Pottery.  But what i admired most was the architect of their dwellings and buildings. There is a ceremony of Dance by the PUEBLO INDIANS to entertain us. This documentary is just 20mins in lengh, And the picture quality is poor. But then some of those clips are very ancient.",1334534400,2,471,4.674698795180723
