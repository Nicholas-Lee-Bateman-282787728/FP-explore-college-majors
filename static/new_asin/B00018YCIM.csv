SOR-RY.
The comedy was not very funny, was the kind of funny someone with not too many rocks upstairs would laugh at.  No more funny than the stuff your kid says when he first discovers the ""why did the chicken cross the road"" jokes- and at least your kid is cute- to you.  I took it off my list and it would take lots to get me to give another episode a try.  I am all over and done with the comedy for the ignora-masses.",1419897600,,547,4.0

He doesn't go too far and he does it with joy and a smile on his face. Long ago I watched this series when it first came out and I was much younger. Years later his sketches still hold up.

If you are curious about the Chapelle style of comedy, then this is the perfect spot. It It's his show, there it is, Enjoy. It's a great show for it's time. It opened my eyes when I watched original airing. Now, not so much. Comedy in general is more in your face today. Glad I watched again, but not necessarily again and again. How about some more ""newer"" comedy shows. What about more women? Great commedians like Joan Rivers, who was for me timeless. Never stopped refining her art. Still on top, still trying, pushing, being current, that's the difference. Need newer shows. A lot of comedy involves current events and older shows lose that punch. Just saying.

His characters, from ""Crack Head"" to ""Player Haters"" is just hilarious. I was so disappointed when I heard he had quit his show.  I hope he returns to it one day soon, because I want to see more of this very funny guy.  He's got a really special vibe, and he's a deep cat, who wants to know the truth of the world, while ""keeping it real"".

1981251,5,B00018YCIM,"Chappelle's Show came out of nowhere and put the genius inner workings of Dave Chappelle on display for all to see. I think the first 3 episodes had already aired before I was told I needed to check him out, and my introduction to his show, not to him as I had already learned about him in 1996, was the second episode with Tyrone Biggums. And every single episode that was to follow I was glued to the t.v. and crying hysterically! The impressions his parents made upon him clearly to impact his world and the world around us. His education through his parents made him much richer than the slavery of a 4-year degree(and yes, I slaved for my degree that no matter how much business I got for portraits, murals, teaching calligraphy and cursive writings, no one EVER asked me, ""Where'd you go to school?""--my talent would have been better served as an apprentice, but no one around me understood how to show me what could possibly be achieved independent of a university, like Chappelle's parents indirectly stimulated). Amazing how Comedy Central is STILL trying that spark that caused millions to tune in to his show and long after his show ended, it remained the #1 rated show on Comedy Central despite that. He firmly put Comedy Central on the map, as South Park made people aware of the channel, but Chappelle's Show made people come and stay.",1397088000,,1349,4.625

have to branch out since there are not enough seasons to sustain a main course

Beginning with his ""black 'white racist'"" Clayton Bigsby, and through the less 'serious' sketches like the Kinko's send up, Chappelle brings the noise.  Second season is much less even, with more duds.  But Season 1 has a 85% excellent rate, with only 15% duds.  Season two is more like 70/30.

1981460,5,B00018YCIM,"No one is a creative or compassionate about comedy as Dave Chappelle. That is why his shows, on and off air, have been so successful. Dave has a wide latitude of appeal and is loved adults by all ages, races and social statuses. His brand of twisted, real life humor is cutting, at times biting, but always funny.

Sometimes the topic or language may be offensive to those with extremely thin skin or excessively tender sensitivities. But those same ones are offended by Mister Rogers, Oprah, Chris Farley, Bill Mahr, Fox News, KRS-One, pole dancing, professional sports, and everything in between! They just cannot be happy and live to be offended. I used to perform in a band with people like that. They seriously thought a shirt I often wore was offensive because it was camouflage colored. Morons!

But if you are not in that category and you love a laugh that may be intellectual, witty, challenging and open-minded, you will find this series a welcome addition to your comedy collection.

In my opinion, Chappelle should be revered as America's top adult-level comic. It is not for the young as some strong language, drug-references and Prince parodies are included.

Chappelle has re-written human response to the age old challenge ""JUST WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?"" When you get this kind of attitude, whether in the home, in the club, on the street or in your place of employment, think of Dave Chappelle and let your answer be a resounding:

I'M RICK JAMES, B%TCH!

1981543,5,B00018YCIM,They said Dave Chappelle was the next Richard Pryor. Those are tough shoes to fill but this show clearly shows Chappelle is close to doing that. I must say first off for the price alone it's a must buy. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. The show has a lot of funny sketches that are just classic. It's scary to realize it's been ten years since the show started. Chappelle was always smart in making career choices. He knew when they take a break. The first two seasons of Chappelle show are good but avoid the third season. I don't think Chappelle wanted to do it. This season is a great introduction to new fans of Chappelle. Half Baked and Screwed were two of his best movies. He was funny in Con Air too. I think it's a great birthday gift or Christmas gift too. It's too bad Dave Chappelle has done as many shows or movies but I don't think he wanted to get overexposed. But if you want to see some of the best stuff he's done look no further than here and Half Baked. Cheers!,1365033600,,986,4.25

This dvd was crazy. I really loved the Crack Head (Tyrone Biggums). You really need to get this dvd. You do not know what you are missing!!!!!",1141430400,,303,4.206896551724138
1981641,5,B00018YCIM,This dvd rocks!  This dude is as funny as they come.  Very original and different.  The new king of comedy!,1140825600,,107,4.25
1981642,5,B00018YCIM,"Dave Chappelle is hilarious, plain and simple. People who think his comedy is overly offensive only says so out of ignorance. By watching Chappelle's Show, you'll quickly learn that Dave makes fun of himself as much as he does other people, and most of his comedy is based off of common American stereotypes, as well as current affairs and pop-culture. Dave's style is often shameless, which is what makes it so funny, and unadulterated.

Season 1 is easily his best, I think, because it introduces Dave's most legendary characters. Though the entire series has a lot worth watching, a few episodes stick out to me as the best. And it starts with the very first episode, where Dave plays a blind, black white supremacist well-known for his racist books. From there, Dave introduces his second greatest character (behind season two's Rick James) in Tyrone Biggums, a crackhead always out for the next rock. Then, there's Paul Mooney in ""Ask a Black Dude""; there's Dave's version of The Real World; a pimp's convention where some more of Dave's most outrageous character are introduced; a play on the History Channel and the gang wars of the 1980s; and of course, you can't forget Dave's portrayal of R. Kelly and his recent troubles.

The bonus features are pretty decent too, with some deleted scenes and bloopers taken from the many episodes, with some more coverage of ""Ask a Black Dude."" Plus, five of the episodes, the best episode at that, have commentary from Dave and Neal Brennan, the co-creator of Chappelle's Show.

As a package, this can't be beat. It has what is easily the funniest stuff to come out in a long time, without being watered down by what is popular on TV today. Dave made his own way with this series, and season one is his best example of his comedy style. Pick this up if you've seen the series and liked it. Or, if you're not that sensitive and can laugh at yourself, I'd also recommend Chappelle's show for you. Dave is the new fearless king of comedy, and stands there alone.",1137974400,3,2006,4.693181818181818

I guess he can't afford cable so he watches crappy shows on lonley saturday nights. People like you don't know good humor when you see it. And people haven't said that Rick James line for a long time now and it's not on this chappelles season 1,it's on season 2. But here's one for the road: ""I'm Rick James Bitch"". When Chappelle first came out people have been telling me to watch his show and it's funny. So I finally got a chance to see an episode. The first episode I saw was the R. Kelly skit. Man I was laughing so hard. And on this DVD, it is full of funny skits. The blind kkk member skit was hilarious. I even like the Zapped when he suppose to do something like Punk but he's robbing a bank and other great stuff. But the best skit off this season has to be The Mad Real World. One white guy surrounded by six crazy black people. Hey I pay to see that. Bottom line the funniest stuff I've seen on T.V.

1981647,5,B00018YCIM,"Ah, Dave Chappelle. One of our generation's better comedians... I mean, how many people in this day and age go this far in their comedy?

In early 2003, Dave Chappelle started his own show on Comedy Central, ""Chappelle's Show"" (well, duh, you're looking at it right now). It was an instant hit. Why? Simple: it's funny, outrageous, and pushes the envelope in ways previously thought unimaginable (check out the ""Black White Supremacist"" sketch!). Dave Chappelle is charismatic with the crowd, and knows how to talk to an audience. His voices, attitude, comedy, and mannerisms, rolled into one, make for some funny, funny stuff. This is sort of like ""In Living Color"" for the new millenium.

If you're looking for the ""I'm Rick James B***h"" sketch, it's not on here (I think it's season two). This is before everyone started running around using that catchphrase. This is from early 2003, when the only kids in my class who watched it were me and two of my friends, and we would go into class the next day quoting it while everyone else looked on like we were crazy (um.. never mind). Best sketches: ""Popcopy"", ""The Black White Supremacist"", ""Roots Outtakes"", ""Tyrone Biggums"", et cetera.

To Dave, best wishes, hope you're getting better.",1127001600,,1238,4.885714285714286

The musical content was a significant part of the appeal of the show.

1981671,5,B00018YCIM,"Dave Chappelle has been one of my favorite comedians since I first saw him back in ""Half-Baked"" in 1998. Since then Dave-Mania has exploded, causing Dave to get his own sketch comedy show on Comedy Central appropriately titled ""Chappelle's Show"". Now I don't know if Dave is the primary writer of these skits, but whoever is, is an absolutely hilarous, and sickly demented. Dave's show is one that you can laugh with your friends, or by yourself, it doesn't really matter, because the show is so damn funny. Making fun of politics, culture and almost anything else you can imagine, Chappelle's show pushes the limit every episode and doesn't care who it offends.

Season one has some of the best skits the show has done thus far, including spoofs of ""The Real World"" and ""Trading Places"". The characters and ideas are just so funny. You can't help but laugh. If you're uptight about crude humor, then this show is probably not for you. On Chappelle's show, no one and no race is safe. Don't take it personally, or you're going to miss the real comedy behind a lot of his opinions. I'm white and I don't take it seriously. I actually think it's very funny. The Extras including on the DVD are well worth buying, including commentary on episodes, deleted scenes, outtakes and more. The outtakes and deleted are by far the best piece of extras on here. Still episodes containing skits like ""Blackzilla"", ""The Mad Real World"", ""Trading Spouses"", Dave's version of Grand Theft Auto, ""Great Moments in Hook-up History"" and many more, you will not be dissapointed by this purchase.

I can't wait til season two hits stores, but until that time, season one will hold me over. The fact that it's uncensored is even better, because I don't know why, but hearing Dave say the F word is jusf funny. He has a way of saying this that just can't be emmulated. If you're a fan of the show, then you probably already own this, but if you haven't seen it, or you like what Dave Chappelle has been in, but somehow skipped the show, then go out and pick this up immediately.

1981675,5,B00018YCIM,"I had caught snippets of Chappelle's Show here and there before, but I had never made a point of actually sitting down and watching a complete episode.  Then a friend of mine told me about a hilarious skit featuring Dave Chappelle as a black white supremacist (he is blind and doesn't know he is actually a black man); if it was only half as funny as she said it was, I knew I had to see it for myself, so I soon bought myself a copy of Chappelle's Show Season One.  Not only is the skit in question hilarious, it basically defines the type of humor Dave Chappelle brings to the comedy scene.  I don't think the television viewing audience has ever seen anything like this before - certainly not to the extremes that Dave Chappelle takes it.  When he jokes about the fact the show has not been cancelled yet, it actually rings with a bit of truth.  Very few comedians could get away with this type of over-the-top humor.

To say that this is mature humor is something of an understatement.  Adult language abounds, and all the bleeps you heard on television are now removed - thus, the Uncensored! tagline.  You'll find a lot of jokes centered on human anatomy - especially female anatomy.  Far beyond everything else, though, is a relentless comedic skewering of racism.  Some would probably consider this a racist show, actually - the ""n word"" is used in abundance, and stereotypes of blacks, Asians, whites, and other races are exploited shamelessly.  The whole point of the race-based comedy, though, is to show just how extreme and ridiculous racist thinking and behavior really is.  Some people won't ""get it,"" of course, and they will probably think Chappelle's Show is one of the most offensive things they have ever witnessed - and that's OK.  The majority of viewers, I believe, will ""get it"" and will join me in an extended laugh-fest that lasts throughout all twelve episodes of Season One as well as the bonus materials included in this DVD offering.

Among the gut-bustingly funny stuff you will find in Chappelle's Show Season One are the antics of crack addict Tyrone Biggums (including a visit to a drug awareness day at an elementary school), Chappelle-ized scenes from hit films such as Roots and The Matrix, a news report detailing the profound aftereffects brought about by the paying of reparations for slavery, ""Great Moments in Hookup History,"" a ""Real World"" episode featuring one really white guy living with five crazy African-Americans, a hard-hitting documentary detailing the racism of famous animal performers, a documentary covering great inner city gang wars of the 1980s, an interracial episode of Trading Spouses, numerous Chappelle-ized television ads, Ask a Black Dude features with comedian Paul Mooney, a hilarious look at the international Player Hater Ball, and of course a lot of crude jokes about drugs and bodily functions.  The only bad thing about these episodes is the fact that they are sometimes rather short.  Chappelle featured rap and hip-hop musical guests on each show, but those segments are not included on nine of the twelve episodes you get here (and it's only a half-hour show to begin with).

The comedy is a little uneven at times.  A few skits never really catch fire and are thus forgettable, but the vast majority of the material here will have you rolling in the aisles.  Even the kind of toilet humor that normally isn't that funny will have you in stitches because Chappelle just keeps going to the well so many times that he makes it funny despite itself.

Five of the episodes come with audio commentary by Dave Chappelle and the show's co-creator Neal Brennan (who is white, by the way), as does the extra 29-minute feature of bloopers and deleted scenes.  I was actually a little disappointed by the audio commentary; it was informational but not as funny as I had expected.  The bloopers and deleted scenes were also less than hilarious - but I realized long ago (thanks to Dick Clarke and Ed McMahon) that bloopers really aren't very funny much of the time.  All these extras are just icing on the cake, though, as the twelve episodes of the show more than make this Season One collection worth the money.

The man put a skit in the debut episode about a black, white supremacist, you can't be much more daring than that, and hardly ever funnier while doing so. He literally pisses on modern conventional humor. This is a solid DVD set, and the bonus material is priceless. So, while other tv shows are charging $30-60 a season, spend $20 and pick up the Chappelle's Show Season 1, play it on a loop until it melts, which should be just about when season 2 comes out; everyone wins!(except the dvd player)

try it and i promise you'll get hooked like Tyrone Biggums is to crack. I LOVE IT!!! nothin' out there is even close to Chappelle's Show and i've seen them all; SNL, In Living Color, MadTV. definitely this is as good as it gets.

 One of my favorite scenes was the ""Mad Real World""...a whole episode of sketches revolving around a Real World scenario, but with all black roommates and one white guy. And what results is just pure comedy gold.

 The only reason I gave this set 4 stars is because of some of the almost racist/stereotype comments that chappelle says/bases some of the sketches off of, and can be taken as offensive to some people (though, I am not one of them)

The show is filled with expletives, so this can become a bit bothersome, but on the dvd, no such restrictions are applied.  While actually hearing the words don't improve the already side splitting humor, it allows to watch the show as Mr. Chappelle intended it to be seen.  The show takes one many sacred cows, but it especially looks at race issues.  Mr. Chappelle isn't afraid play the race card for laughs such as a clip of ""outtakes"" from Roots, a news report about the government finally giving reprobations for slavery and the show's infamous sketch about Clayton Bigsby, the country's big white supremist who turns out to be a blind black man.

1981711,4,B00018YCIM,"I'll put it simply: hilarious stuff. Not all of the sketches work, and some of them are simply empty shock humor, but on the whole this is the CHAPPELLE'S SHOW season to remember (Season Two, on a whole, was not as good as this one, I think). Probably the best episode of the season is Episode 6, with two hilarious sketches: a hilarious spoof of ""Antwone Fisher"" starring Chappelle in his own jazzed-up life story; and an even funnier takeoff of MTV's ""Real World,"" in which a white guy is forced to live with five other crazy black people, with hilariously bad results. I just couldn't stop laughing throughout these two sketches! Other highlights of the season that come readily to my mind include Episode 1's controversial Clayton Bigsby sketch, the two sketches involving crackhead extraordinaire Tyrone Biggums (Episodes 2 & 8), and the sketches in Episode 4 in which blacks finally get their reparations for slavery. Episode 9's ""Player Haters Ball"" sketch is a guilty pleasure of mine---sure, it relies too much on hollow insult humor, but the insults are sidesplitting. As for Episode 10's infamous skewering of R. Kelly...it's admittedly one-note, but it's funny too.
I won't talk too much about what makes Dave Chappelle funny (since that would take away from the humor, now would it?). Suffice it to say, he tends to use a lot of the stereotypes of blacks that are prevalent in our society today, but exaggerates them to such a degree that it veers into hilarious parody---that is what gives his brand of sketch comedy its valuable and relevant edge.
In short, if you want to see some smart TV humor, this 2-DVD set of the first season of CHAPPELLE'S SHOW will, for the most part, satisfy. It's not consistently funny, and some skits are smarter than others, but its high points are truly brilliant, and there is always something to laugh at in every episode. Unfortunately, some of the musical performances at the end of a good deal of the episodes have been cut (apparently due to rights issues), but I certainly don't watch these episodes for its music.

1981713,4,B00018YCIM,"Overall, this is a pretty good DVD set and is reliably funny. If you know who Dave Chappelle is and if you find his stuff funny, you'll give this a look and you'll like it. If you don't know who he is and you are easily disgusted or sensetive, you won't like this at all.
Other people have gone into detail about what sketches are good and which ones aren't; I gave the set 4 stars out of 5 because there are a few in there which were either too juvenile or just not funny enough for me. So far however, those have been in the minority, but it must be noted.
Dave Chappelle is a very good comedian who has the potential to draw level with Chris Rock, who I think is the better of the two and is probably the best of the modern-day comedians (props to Bernie Mac, relase some albums and specials so I can compare you better man!). (...)Dave's social and relational commentary is just as good as Chris's, but you shouldn't have to pander. If it's his thing, then that's cool; but while it is funny, it's still low-brow. Maybe Chris Rock does the same thing, but I just notice it more with Chappelle.
Still, give it a whirl, he's sure to make you laugh and he isn't a bad comedian at all. I've enjoyed most of what i've seen so far.",1087862400,2,1229,4.168067226890757

I laughed and I laughed till I couldn't breathe anymore. Then when I heard these DVD's were coming out, I knew I had to buy this. This is a great collection to have in your DVD collection. I know I will be purchasing the second season as well when it comes out.

Episode 1- Dave plays a blind white supremacies (aka white power!)
episode 2- Dave plays a crack addict and visits a elementary school (""aka drugs and alcohol, have ruined my life"")
episode 3- Dave makes fun of the classic film the roots (aka ""I told you all not to give me a real baby"")
episode 4- Dave awards women with great NY (...)(you got great (...)"")
episode 5-Dave reflects on Great Moments in hookup history (aka ""would anyone want to take this drunk, (...), lady home"")
episode 6- Dave makes fun of the ""Real World"" (aka ""I'm bad, Tyrese you stabbed my dad"")
episode 7- Dave makes fun of the matrix and pretty women (aka ""you know what, you got to get the fu^& out of here"")
episode 8- Dave talks about hook-up history (aka ""(...) in the popcorn"")
episode 9-  Dave pokes fun at Godzilla and Grand Theft Auto
episode 10- Dave makes fun of R. Kelly with his new I wanna pee on you ( aka ""haters wanna hate, lovers wanna love, I don't even know none of thee above I wanna piss on you"")
episode 11- Dave buys a camera and sees peoples thoughts etc. (aka turns those headphones up, I can't hear out of my left ear. What!"")

There were some skits where I didn't laugh at all.  There are some hilarious ones though, my favorite being Dave's mock R. Kelly song, 'I Wanna Pee on You.'  Still got that one stuck in my head...  However, there are only so many""'I'm Rick James, bi**h!'s"" I can take.

I hardly knew who the guy was until the show started, and my opinion now is that Dave Chappelle is one of the funniest comedians alive today. His comedic brilliance comes from the fact that he ""keeps it real"". He is so laid back and clearly knows what he is doing and loves doing it.
The show is comprised of different skits, each hilarious in their own right. When the show first aired I knew it would probably be funny but I had no idea. Skits such as Tyrone the crackhead, Player Haters Ball, R.Kelly's Pee on You video all had me laughing harder than I have in a long time. While some people may think this is an immature show just remember it is sketch comedy designed only to entertain the viewer. And season 1 certainly served its purpose. As far as the DvD goes you get all the classic skits uncut, seeing them the way it was meant to be seen. Every episode is here. I am glad to now own dvd quality copies of skits like Popcopy, Great Moments in Hook-up History and History's Greatest Wars(that is started when one member of a gang steps on another one's sneakers and pours Morton salt all over him in a convenience store.classic.).
Any fan of comedy should own this, as it will crack you up even after multiple viewings. Some of the musical acts were pretty good though and most of them were not included here. That is the only negative, and I hope they will include everything on the season 2 set. Now I am waiting for that set which cant come out soon enough.

With such memorable sketches as Clayton Bigsby, a blind KKK publicist who happens to be black, ""Great Moments In Hook-Up History"" and Dave's take on a number of classic movies, ""Chappelle's Show"" offers countless laughs. Not only does this DVD restore all the stuff that was censored out on cable but it includes tons of bonus footage like a bloopers reel and more of ""Ask A Black Dude"" with Paul Mooney.

1981724,5,B00018YCIM,"Dave Chappelle has raised the genre of sketch comedy to new levels.  Sketch comedy has been lackluster as of late, with SNL and MadTV shadows of their former selves.  New shows like Kids in the Hall are ok, but not gutwrenchingly funny.  Chappelle's Show delivers the deep laughs SNL used to.  His humor pushes the envelope in all areas.  Chappelle's humor is racial, sexist, and vulgar.  If you are offended easily, DO NOT watch Chappelle's Show, as it tends to be very offensive.  But if you like darker humor and can laugh about things you will love Chappelle's Show.  Chappelle is a comedic genius.  His material is very original and well done.  He satirizes pop culture, racism, and pretty much everything else.  The actors on the show are excellent, especially Charlie Murphy (Eddie Murphy's little brother).  If you enjoy Richard Pryor or George Carlin, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of Chappelle's Show Season One, and you should catch season 2 on Comedy Central.  If you are offended by Chappelle's Show and think it is racists, remember Chappelle himself is black and its supposed to be overtly offensive.  Chappelle's style of humor is shock humor.

My first Chappelle expierence was ""Half Baked"" (which I highly suggest you pick up) and I thought it was hilarious. And Dave wrote most of it. The thing that makes him so special is that he's not only funny; he's creative. I mean, c'mon. You have to be pretty damn creative to think of something like a black white supremisist and instead of making it bomb and offend everyone like it easily could have, you make it funny!
Dave also writes the majority of his show (there's another guy too...ah, I can't remember his name), which is just fine with me. My favorites bits of Season 1 were the R. Kelly music video, the black white supremisist and the Mad Real World (which also contains one of my favorite quotes: ""You sit DOWN when you pee. I better not catch you standing up!""). If a friend watched this, you'll find yourself quoting it and laughing about it all day. I mean, how many times has someone said ""I'm Rick James, b*tch"" or ""YEEEEEEEEEAH"" at your school?
All I can say is that you need this if you consider yourself a person who likes to laugh.

I also have black friends at school that think the show is hilarious. So as you can see, the show is funny to practically everyone, no matter how they feel about racial issues that Dave pokes fun at. I believe it is Dave's open assault on the stupidity of racism that will eventually end the hatred and show people how ridiculous it is just to hate someone based on their ethnic background.
""The Niggar Family"" sketch is a prime example. Dave shows us all that the N-Word is nothing more than that: a word. We need to forget about the stupid mistakes of the past and live together in unity.

Dave Chappelle really lets his characters out in all of these hilarious skits, going after everything from out of control break dancin' girls in Mitsubishi commercials, to his own take on the idiotic Real World MTV series, to old Japanese Godzilla movies.  Freakin' funny stuff.  The episodes are complete and even include the end credits for each one, so  you won't miss the extra scenes Dave Chappelle always threw in running next to the credits.  Also includes some bloopers and extra ""Ask Paul Mooney"" segments.  This is the best comedy out there right now.  This show is what the pathetic repetitive uncreative Saturday Night Live dreams of being!",1081987200,2,812,4.784172661870503

The skits are very wild,""NY Boobs"",""ROOTS"",and countless others. Some of the Episodes come with commentary. Dave really says and does things that we all think ...haaaa Ask a Black Dude with paul Mooney haaaa.
 There are also many comeos also check out the blooper and deleted scenes. Go out and buy this, you might be offend but laughing will get you over it. Crack KIlls...lol",1081987200,2,514,4.468085106382978
1981732,5,B00018YCIM,"Before i bought 'Season 1' of the Chappelle Show on DVD i had watched every episode in the season already. The thing that makes this DVD so hilarious is the fact that its uncensored and uncut. Dave Chappelle takes humor to extreme levels in this package complete with all the first season episodes (some featuring commentary by Dave and other show creators) and deleted bonus material such as the 20 minute 'Ask a Black Dude' segment with comedian Paul Mooney.
The sketches on the 'Chappelle's Show' season one are undeniably hilarious. Dave spoofs everyone from Ms. Cleo (on ""Dave Chappelle's Educated Guess Line"") to R. Kelly (on the ""Piss On You"" and ""Piss On You (remix)"" skits) with his over-the-top racism and negativity. Most people would say ""that isn't funny"" or ""how can you laugh at that?"", but the fact of the matter is that this is what America wants to see. Taking such current shows as MTV's The Real World (""The Mad Real World"") and Trading Spaces (""Trading Spouses"") and making them into twisted masterpieces is exactly what Dave Chappelle is so good at. Even the skits that are so cruel (such as a sketch where Dave visits a cancerous boy in the hospital) they still make you burst out laughing after Chappelle has worked his magic on them.
The shows negative points are few but still are visible. The execissive use of racist slurs like 'n****' create an unpleasent atmosphere for most of the episodes as well does the constant usage of 'f***' and 'b****'. Also is the repitive nature of the skits, seeing as almost every one involves the same ""i hate white people"" message.
Overall, however, the complete first season is unflawed by any negative comments and comes off as a masterpiece. The added bonus music from rappers Mos Def, Talib Kweli and De La Soul are an added bonus that makes the disc even more fun to watch. It has been said so many times before, but this is the future of television and Dave Chappelle will be around for a very long time.",1081900800,9,1972,4.653295128939828

1981734,5,B00018YCIM,"I've been a fan of Dave Chappelle since Half Baked.  I've seen him live and I saw the HBO special. His show is without question one of the top three sketch comedies on television.
Alot has been made about how it's racist or how he gets away with using the ""n word"", but when I see a show like ""Banzai"" being advertised during this show, you just have to realize that shows like this are out there, some of them are just funnier. This is one of the funnier ones.
The skits are fresh, original, and most importantly, even-handed. Dave doesn't discriminate when it comes to knocking on a race. Tyrone, the black crackhead would have gotten pretty much any other show on television off the air, and I think that's an important indication of how strong the show itself is.
Granted, the second season so far has been far superior, but the first season was still better than at least 90% of the stuff that is on TV.",1081468800,2,908,4.372781065088757
1981735,5,B00018YCIM,"That's right, I said it. Chappelle's Show is edgier, more original and overall funnier than Saturday Night Live; the granddaddy of sketch comedy shows, has ever been on it's best day. While Saturday Night Live has constantly thrown us new cast members in a hit or miss fashion (more often miss), Chappelle's Show focuses on the star whose name appears in the title so you know right away if you will appreciate Dave's sense of humor. Between Dave Chappelle's already brazen sense of humor and his show being aired on cable, the door has been left wide open for anything goes material and being as though this set is uncensored, it becomes even more evident that this show will not appeal to someone with some social justice axe to grind. Dave Chappelle goes for the jugular on anyone who is within target range. Nobody is spared.
Each episode has it's high and low points but no matter how low the show might appear, another skit is right around the corner to pull the show above the competition. Some of my favorite sketches feature Dave as a blind black white supremacist or as a crotchity white news anchorman reporting on Reparations 2003. The show fires on all cyclinders when it tackles some issues that even the most self-appointed un-PC comics wouldn't touch with a 100 foot pole and Dave Chappelle looks at subject matter of that ilk with a sick, (...) grin and dives in headfirst with no qualms about who he might offend. For the sensitive type, Chappelle's Show is amatuerish, immature and brash. To those of us who realize that humanity is hopeless, Chappelle's Show delivers the laughs in droves.",1081468800,11,1609,4.729537366548043

And I think it shows what a unique comedian Dave Chappelle is that he can make me laugh so hard I cry, while also making me a bit horrified that I'm laughing at all. The racial jokes that he has in here are hilarious (the blind black white supremicist might be the funniest skit I have ever seen, Mad Real World, the crack addict, Real Movies, they're all way too funny), and make me think that Dave Chappelle is ushering a whole new era of race relations.
Not for the easily offended.",1081468800,3,540,4.252427184466019
1981738,3,B00018YCIM,"With the scourge of political correctness maintaining its grip on American society, the sketch comedy of ""Chappelle's Show"" has come along at a very opportune time.  Dave Chappelle and his writers obviously take a great deal of pleasure in demolishing sacred cows, and Comedy Central's loose standards ensure that no taboo subject is off-limits.  And as an equal-opportunity offender, Dave ensures that his show can be enjoyed by anyone with a fully functioning sense of humor.  You may have to wade through some slow moments, but this debut season is still worth its relatively small price tag for comedy enthusiasts.
""Chappelle's Show"" makes heavy use of racial humor, and while part of me decries the double standard that allows a black comic to get away with jokes that would get a white guy pulled off the air in a matter of seconds, the other part of me can't help but laugh at some of what Dave comes up with.  He comes out firing in the very first episode with a newsmagazine piece on Clayton Bigsby, a vicious, blind white supremacist who's never been told a terrible secret: he's black.  Later on we're introduced to Tyrone Biggums, a not-quite-recovered crack addict who pays a visit to a local elementary school in order to scare a few kids straight.  In another brilliant drug-related bit, Dave advertises ""O'Dweed,"" a new strain of marijuana with the THC taken out for that family-friendly effect.
There's plenty of fun with stereotypes to be found, as well.  It's not easy to deal with serious topics in a lighthearted manner, but ""Chappelle's Show"" may well do it better than any show to hit the airwaves since ""South Park."" Episode four skewers the whole reparations-for-slavery debate with a look at what might actually happen if blacks ever get their money from the government.  ""The Mad Real World"" presents a terrifying vision of a lone white guy trapped in a house with six crazed black people.  And in perhaps the season's finest moment, the last episode's ""Trading Spouses"" skit, the show gives us a hilarious take on interracial relations when a white couple and a black couple swap wives and cameras are there to capture the shocking results.
This isn't to say the show's perfect, or even close to it at this point.  There are still plenty of kinks to work out, as many promising skits go over the top or just don't go anywhere.  For every inspired idea like ""It's a Wonderful Chest,"" where a woman who resents her large chest gets a glimpse of what life would be like without it, there's an aimless waste of screen time like the painfully unfunny ""Blackzilla.""  Like many new shows, this one is wildly inconsistent, and you have to wait through some dead moments to get to the good stuff.  The current season has shown a bit more direction, so some patience is definitely well-advised here.
While there is some room for improvement, it should be kept in mind that ""The Simpsons"" and ""South Park"" weren't anything all that special in their first seasons either.  Dave's boldness and ambition are refreshing, even if he does occasionally fall short of his mark.  Hell, nowadays I'm just grateful to see something other than reality TV coming out.  So give ""Chappelle's Show"" a shot.",1081296000,8,3207,4.803636363636364

1981746,4,B00018YCIM,"I've gotta say something about zooropaflygirl's review! She's young and prone to polarized opinions, but I can't believe she basically blamed white people for what she sees as bad comedy from a black man. Well, I guess I can accept that as long she'll take the blame for Vanilla Ice. What? No?

Zooropaflygirl writes, ""Okay the last time I checked rock and roll is BLACK music."" Black contributions to rock are undeniable. Might even say its pioneers *were* black ... but when one artist influences another, the art that results is still the achievement of the second, not the first. Just because some of the major influences on rock were black, that doesn't mean you can now ignore the contributions of all other races. That's a narrow, ethnocentric view for someone who claims to be so well-educated.

The chord progessions used in pretty much all modern music were developed by classical composers who lived hundreds of years ago, and they were pretty much all white! Because a white man wrote the first novel, does that mean novels are ""white literature""? Does that diminish the contributions of great black writers? The first films were made by white men. Does that mean Spike Lee owes it all to them?

Would it help if I told you that, hundreds of thousands of years ago, all humans came from Africa -- and may well have all had dark skin? If you're truly a student of history, think about *that* history. We're more alike than we are different. Hope that doesn't get in the way of your anger too much.

But then you really floored me: ""The show's target audience is white people, who eat this stuff up. This is how white America perceives us. ... That's what Dave Chappelle is: a 13-year old white boy trapped in a black man's body."" Sure, paint Chapelle white so you can hate him freely. But NO, he's an adult black man who made his own decisions about what kind of comedy to do.

What *is* white America? Am I part of it, just because I'm white? If so, you're claiming to know more about my perceptions than I do ... and you couldn't be more wrong. You know that feeling you get when you see a representation of a black person that has NOTHING to do with you, like the stereotypes you mention? Well that's exactly how I feel when you say, ""This is how white America perceives us."" Is it so hard for you to believe that, just as not all blacks say ""whatup G"", not all whites believe black stereotypes, oppress blacks, and try to take credit for black contributions?

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that while your grandfather may be a learned man who deserves respect, he may also have trouble letting go of anger over what he may have suffered. And he passed that anger on to you. Well, people in my grandparents' generation used the N word, but I don't. Times change. And it bothers me that you're heading off to college with this kind of crap in your mind. We're all in this together. You can be proud of what you are without slamming what you're not.

""And if you think Dave Chappelle is some innovative comic genius that addresses racial issues, shoot yourself in the face."" Guess your resorting to violent rhetoric was only a matter of time ...

For those of you who have more fiber in your diet and a little less anger than zooropaflygirl, buy the dvd. You'll enjoy it.",1080086400,26,3291,4.491638795986622

Are there jokes about blacks? yes. Are there jokes about whites? yes. Are there jokes about orientals? yes. EVERYONE is made fun of so don't act as if it's just one group. Heck he made a jab at everyone in ONE airliner skit (blacks, arabs, native americans, whites etc)

1981750,1,B00018YCIM,"WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Dave Chappelle is NOT funny. Dave Chappelle is to comedy what KFC is to soul food. It is juvenile, clich, and tiresome. Next Richard Pryor? Muwhahahaha.. (The only funny sketch I saw was the one about the Klan). I recently saw a commercial addressing the show's negative image of white people! HA! What a big fat joke. This show has the opposite problem- it's negative portrayal of BLACK people. Yeah that's right; you heard me correctly. I am sick to death of the negative, false, and inaccurate stereotypes of us on television, every one in the book portrayed in this show. From the clich ghetto-acting hip hop stereotypes to the crack-smoking, I am ready to hurl. And the lies. One of many examples: I saw this sketch the other night on his show about how white people looooove electric guitar and Latinos love electric piano. Okay the last time I checked rock and roll is BLACK music invented by BLACK people; the sad thing is that half the planet thinks that it's white music and Elvis invented it, which is such a lie. In that sketch is the trendy stereotype of black people being absent minded ""Yo whaddup G"" fools that can't play instruments and just rap. We f*ckin' play every instrument in American music, as well as invented some of them, AND invented every genre of American popular music. (R&B/soul, rock, jazz/ragtime, reggae, etc. Also if it weren't for blacks we wouldn't have country because several country instruments like the banjo are black inventions, and the roots of country music trace back to Negro spirituals and folk songs. I may be only 17, but I'm not nave and I'm a liberal black woman who knows my history). The reason why this show is so successful is because the show's target audience is white people, who eat this stuff up. This is how white America perceives us. Especially 13-year old white boys who looove those ghetto-acting ""it's cool to be stupid"" stereotypes. That's what Dave Chappelle is: a 13-year old white boy trapped in a black man's body. I wonder if Chappelle really is a stupid modern-day minstrel ""coon"" or a smart man who is laughing up the bank by exploiting these stereotypes for his own profit and benefit. It's not like it's the 1930's and he doesn't have a choice. Fine if you enjoy watching this show but if you think this represents real-world African-Americans, get your head out of your ass! And if you think Dave Chappelle is some innovative comic genius that addresses racial issues, shoot yourself in the face. I haven't met any brothers or sisters who disagreed with everything I just said. Do all yourselves a favor and rent Spike Lee's Bamboozled. Read ""My Bondage and My Freedom"" by Frederick Douglass. Listen to an Otis Redding record. Talk to my grandfather-a scientist, professor, and teacher of Afro-American studies and Latin. Those are REAL African-Americans. Bottom line: At least Stepin Fetchit was funny. (I'm willing to risk getting lots of anti-votes because I'm brutally honest, a lot of you people can't cope with the truth. I'd rather write an an honest review and be deluged in anti-votes than lie and receive ill-gotten votes.

The commentaries are also pretty funny, but Dave's writing partner Neal has an annoying habit of saying the jokes or lines before they happen. The real problem I have with this DVD is the lack of the musical guests. I started listening to Talib Kweli because of his performance of ""Get By"" on the show. There was also a great performance by the Roots that was cut out. One of the other reviewers gives a more thorough breakdown, but I must say I was sorely dissapointed by the musical guests being cut out.

The best thing about the skits, we laugh hard. His points are well made, sometimes subtle and sometimes just uncomfortable which may because we find ourselves laughing at the offensive.
I believe the skit on the Black Klansman could have been the most offensive moment in television history. I was extremely uncomfortable but also laughed so hard it hurt. The next few days I thought about the skit and what it meant to me. Again that is the genious of the show, it will check you if you let it.

  His strong point is that he can cross between the two and pull in both audiences.  It's not 100% all the time.  Especially when he's injecting his politics.
  Other than that he is able to poke fun at everyone.  Just like Chris Rock, no race or gender is safe.  His sketch comedy routines voice the things that one race may not like to say about another. Most importantly, it voices the things races feel about themselves.  His show just allows you to laugh at them in a playful manner.
  Best features are the ""Great Moments In Hook Up History"" complete with stats and that great NFL Films-esque voice over.

Some of the skits on here are downright brilliant and funny (e.g., the reparations skit, the black white supremacist skit, the Real World, the rapper Fisticuffs), some are potty-humor funny (Redman's toilet bowl cleaner? no one else could have done that skit but Redman), and only a few are lackluster (Blackzilla, any of the Great Moments in Hook-Up History).  But there's so many of the first two categories, you'll forget about the misses.
There's twelve episodes on two DVDs with deleted scenes and some unaired ""Ask a Black Dude"" with Paul Mooney material.  The deleted scenes are freaking HILARIOUS.  The Antwone Fisher bit is always funny to me no matter how many times I see it.
Additionally, there is audio commentary on five episodes by Chapelle and his writing partner, Neal Brennan.  This one of the few DVDs where the audio commentary is actually worthwhile.  They explain how they came up with the ideas for skits, which skits offended the most people, explain jokes that are unclear, etc.
Therefore, this is a worthwhile DVD to get.  I must say here that, judging from this DVD, some may be overrating the content here as this sort of real edgy, in-your-face, social commentary.  Yeah, that's here - and when it shows up, it's clever, funny, and thought-provoking.  But alot of the content is baser in nature.  I just hope we get more of the smarter, dark, and edgy stuff in the future.
Two small complaints - I heard that some of the musical performances were removed.  Not good.  (By the way they did include Mos Def absolutely ripping it in Chapelle's car.)  Another thing, they need to include better descriptions on what is in each episode.  Sometimes you just want to see a particular skit and it takes a while to figure out which episode it came from.",1078963200,30,1924,4.741741741741742
1981771,5,B00018YCIM,this is by far the best dvd of the year it had everything including deleted scences this dvd had every skit from the r kelly skit to the MAd real world.

Yes, some sketches (or skits as he calls them) tend to fall flat, but a lot of the sketches hit home runs like the ""What Women Want"" parody or R. Kelly videos.
I can't wait for the second season to come out so I can watch ""True Hollywood Stories"" over and over again.  Give Charlie Murphy his own show where he just tells stories!",1078876800,2,495,4.082474226804123

No. Effort. At. All.  i feel that since everyone is giving him 5 stars cuz they love the show, that someone needs to speak the obvious and say this show is the same repetitive lack of trying skits.

1981779,5,B00018YCIM,"Dave Chappelle is one of the funniest comics out right now. He isn't afraid to make light of the problems that we are dealing with in this country at this moment (politics, racism, etc), and put his own little spin on them. If so many people thought they should ""watch the 700 club instead"", it would not be the 2nd highest rated show on Comedy Central behind South Park! He was brought back for a second season for a reason--he's hilarious!  My favorites are the Charlie Murphy's true Hollywood stories (I'm Rick James b**ch!) and the blind KKK member who's actually black. The R Kelly skit was freakin genius. The one thing the DVD does not have is the musical appearances from the show, but the DVD is great anyway. All the uncensored skits are even better with the cursing!  This definitely a must have!

Every store i went to or called had sold out of it. I guess I underestimated dave's popularity.  Anyway I did get a chance to view it over a friends house yesterday, and it is awesome.

Dave Chappelle is without a doubt the funniest man alive today. The Chapelle Show is filled with controversial, outrageous, and overall hilarious skits that are guaranteed to have you laughing until your stomach hurts. Even the most up tight and liberal minded people will enjoy this show. The show manages to poke fun at racism and all the stereotypes of today very effectively. You will see everything from Chappelle playing a black white supremacist, to a skit done on black people receiving slave reperations and the effect that it has on the economy. Seeing this show on DVD is the only way to go, because it is completely uncensored. Nothing kills the mood more, than an annoying beep from the censors that you would see on Comedy Central. Now you get to see the show uncut and in its entirety without commercial interruption. If there was ever a reason to own a DVD, it is the Chapelle Show!!

His plays on racsisum are some of the funniest most truthful insight of why it exsist.  Blurring the lines of what words really mean is the best way to take away the effect that some words have on people.  If I called you a Dumb a**, unless you are ignorant you are probably aren't going to get mad at me because you know its not true no matter what i say.  That is alot of the points he tries to make in a very satirical way.  He is the new king of satire and anyone who doesnt get it is probably a real racsist.

When the first show of Season 1 started out with the story of a white supremicist, who just happens to be black, I knew i was in for a wild ride.  And if you haven't seen the sketch about the MAD REAL WORLD, you have no idea what you're missing.  You think Saturday Night Live is funny?  Well guess again.

Great comedy like this is rare nowadays. This is a time when ""comedy"" is represented by some teen pervert making love (for prohibition of better words) to a pie. I do find that sort of thing funny, but it is by no means true comedy, raunchy yes but it still takes a genius (Chappelle) to elaborate and make the sketches great. For crying out loud, his Rick James sketch was seen only 2-3 weeks ago and everybody I know is saying ""I'm Rick James b...."" There is even T-shirts for sale already. I'm glad this was released.

1981823,5,B00018YCIM,"Dave Chappelle is, undoubtedly, one of the most daring and intelligent comedians working today. At first glance (or listen), his humor may seem offensive or like little more than toilet humor, but if you dig a little deeper you'll realize that Dave is simply saying the things so many Americans would LOVE to say, but can't.
Chappelle's Show is one of my favorite shows on television. Dave's sense of humor breaks the color boundries and he's not afraid to attack anyone for a laugh. Whites, blacks, Asian...whoever you are, you're a target, and that's the beauty of it. By not singling out anyone, Dave has made a show accessible enough for EVERYONE. Sure, it's controversial and yes, it can be vulgar, but it's also hilarious and only the most uptight of people who take everything at face value could possibly be offended by it.
Dave tackles everything from racism to R. Kelly in the first season and it's some of the most refreshing, intelligent television humor I've seen in years. His ability to look inward and poke fun at himself, as well as everyone else, only makes it funnier. Nothing in the show should be taken too seriously. From it's over-exaggerated racial stereotypes to it's parodies, everything is done with a great deal of humor and, most importantly, intellect.
Chappelle's Show is a brilliant piece of television and kudos should be given to Comedy Central for bringing it out on DVD and, most importantly, giving Dave enough creative control over his show to say and do the things he does and keeping it on the air.",1075939200,60,1538,4.785714285714286

In his interview he voiced that he was bothered that Key and Peele used the same format without crediting him. Maybe he feels that he ""created"" sketch comedy?  If that's they case, then I'd say he should have given a credit to the Wayon's brothers for creating (a much funnier) In Living Color before him, and then maybe they should have credited Carol Burnet?
