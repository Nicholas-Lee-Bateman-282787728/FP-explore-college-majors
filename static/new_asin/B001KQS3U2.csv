3668827,5,B001KQS3U2,"First: this is for the reviewer who gave this workout 1 star but really rated the seller - this is not the place!!!! I wish Amazon would remove it, because it falsifies the overall rating for this DVD.
This DVD is just great! Not only is it effective and challenging, but the variety and instructors are awesome and the routines are so good you're almost sad when it's over. It includes multiple sections (20 or 10 minutes long) to choose from plus a separate bonus section. Also, when you select the workouts there is no preview or advertisment to suffer through like some other DVDs, it gets right to it (thank you for that!). Jake Steinfeld who appears to be in charge of this series has an introduction but you can stop him and go directly to the workouts. I actually own all of the DVDs in this series and every one is excellent. I highly recommend all of them.",1255046400,24,866,4.41875
3668828,5,B001KQS3U2,"I use this DVD at least every other day. I rotate it with 10 minute solution Tummy Toners and Pilates. I really like Jennifer Galiardi's Standing Abs because it is different and it really does work. It really helps tone the sides of your abdominals, and helps slim your waist. Amy Dixon also has a good abdominal routine that is completely different from Jennifer's routine, so I do them both and I have always liked Cindy Whitmarsh and Kendall Hogan. I have all the DVDs in this series and this is probably the one I use most other than the Cardio. I hope they make more DVDS. I download some of the routines from the website but prefer to have the DVD.",1245283200,17,654,4.368852459016393
3668829,1,B001KQS3U2,I never received the item I purchased...  Never heard back from the Seller.  Thankfully Amazon refunded my money.  It makes me very uncomfortable that a company like DVDLEGACY now has my credit card information though.  I've purchased many things thru Amazon and have been completely satisfied ..  this was the first time that I have not been happy with a purchase.  I will continue to purchase items on Amazon - but I will be more careful which Seller I choose.,1239408000,,462,4.7125

8315947,3,B001KQS3U2,"I love the Abs and Back segment by Amy Dixon. I used to do it on Exercise TV and was thrilled to find it on DVD. The others are ok, but you need equipment for many of them. I love Kendall Hogan, but I don't have a medicine ball to use for his segment.",1408233600,,251,3.6666666666666665
8315948,5,B001KQS3U2,One of my favorites! I have rented this from a library and I have noticed a big difference! I had to purchase it and it was wrapped and sealed when arrived!,1404518400,,156,4.064516129032258
8315949,5,B001KQS3U2,"I have been searching for a segment that this DVD includes for quite some time. My cable provider stopped offering Exercise TV and took my favorite Amy Dixon: Abs and Back Workout with it. I was unable to find the workout on the Exercise TV website, but finally found the exact workout on this DVD here! I am very pleased! I tried a different workout today as well and enjoyed it!",1393977600,2,380,4.366197183098592
8315950,5,B001KQS3U2,Great routines that really target trouble spots.  My favorite is the Standing Abs workout by Jennifer Gallardi - I hate rolling around on the ground - this program gives you all the results of a tough ab workout while you stay on your feet.  You will REALLY feel the benefits!  AWESOME!,1376352000,2,286,4.568627450980392
8315951,5,B001KQS3U2,"is perfect for me and my tummy. Ladies, do try it. And you will see a difference. It won't wipe you out but it will help with that tummy bump.",1370908800,,142,3.7666666666666666
8315952,5,B001KQS3U2,"it has great variety, it has a standing ab workout, & all are short workouts. There is something for everyone.",1365984000,,110,4.55
8315953,4,B001KQS3U2,"I like the way the segments are broken down.  Some exercise DVD's 20 minutes can seem like an hour, but this one the 20 minute segment goes by fast.  If you only have 10 minutes to spare there are 3 good choices.",1363219200,,212,4.023809523809524
8315954,4,B001KQS3U2,A good mix of routines. All different. The ball routine is unique. A good basic mix for all levels. Do several for a decent ab workout.,1360540800,,135,4.230769230769231
8315955,4,B001KQS3U2,It has different excercises that focuses on the abs that I can do at home.  I also get to do exercises that used to be on tv anytime I want.,1353196800,,140,3.6666666666666665
