781332,4,6304119011,"Film adaptation of Dicken's Byzantine novel about an odd, tortured, drug-addicted choirmaster who vies for the affections of an attractive young woman who is visiting his village.  But when things don't go his way, he decides to eliminate what he perceives to be his only obstacle, her fiance (and his nephew), Edwin Drood.  Dicken's novel was left half completed at the time of his death and simply ended with Drood missing.  In both film versions (there's a 1993 British remake), it's decided that Drood is murdered, and, rather ironically, they picked the same murderer from among Dicken's stable of eccentric characters.  Rains is superb in his fourth film as a opium addict (who's a cathedral choir master!) who lusts after delicate Heather Angel. During a raging storm on Christmas Eve, Rains strangles Manners and after dumping the corpse in a quicklime pit, tries to pin the murder on Montgomery. A gothic film with shadowy photography, it's pretty creepy due to its very unusual storyline and twists in logic.",958694400,28,1018,5.041666666666667

781433,5,6304119011,"To fully enjoy this Universal classic you have to realize that even though it has been touted as a horror film and was marketed to tv back in the 50's as such, it isn't a horror film. It isn't so much of a mystery either but it is a very well done period piece bordering on a bit of the Gothic. The cast is wonderful and even David Manners comes across much better than he did in films like Dracula where he was ineffective, petulant and whiny. Heather Angel is stunning and Rains is great as the love struck Jasper who has many demons.

The presentation is much better than the old vhs. It would be great if Universal would put a little work into this one and release it on a high definition format. That isn't likely to happen so this will do nicely for now. Thumbs up!",1419724800,11,771,4.174496644295302
781434,5,6304119011,"This is a great print from the Universal Vault Collection of the movie based on Charles Dickens' unfinished novel. Rains is excellent as are all the cast. It was interesting to see Douglass Montgomery in an early role as I have always admired him as Johnny in the British "" The Way To The Stars"" aka ""Johnny Head in Clouds"". A very enjoyable movie highly recommended as an early mystery/noir.",1417219200,3,392,4.614285714285714
781435,5,6304119011,"One of the forgotten Universal gems! I've had this on VHS for years with all my other universal horror collection vhs and dvds. I
got it cause Claude Rains was in it and it was a Universal movie from that era. I'm glad I did. It's not a horror movie! It's more of
a mystery of a story by Charles Dickens he never finished. David Manners from other Universal movies is in it and he's good.
The story is really good and I like the ending they gave the movie. Dickens would have liked it I think. A must have!",1416960000,4,506,4.07
781436,5,6304119011,"Out of all the classic Universal horror films from the 1930s, the Mystery of Edwin Drood is the forgotten gem.  If you are a fan of classic film, then check out this adaptation of Charles Dickens' unfinished final work.  Claude Rains is excellent (par usual) and he is equally creepy and in this gothic thriller.",1413331200,4,312,4.654545454545454
781437,5,6304119011,"Fascinating VHS to watch as the original version of the story, particularly the acting by Claude rains. It is essentionally a classical that can be transformed to a CD",1378771200,,167,4.793103448275862
781438,5,6304119011,This film is based on the last novel by Charles Dickens.  He died before he could finish it.  It is a wonderful whodunit. Claude Rains was brilliant as the deranged corrupt churchman.  The ending the screen writer gave to this story is very likely what Dickens would have written.  Very entertaining movie.,1374537600,,306,4.826923076923077
781439,4,6304119011,"Claude Rains stars as opium addicted choirmaster of Cloisterham cathedral, John Jasper in the 1935 Britsh production of Dickens' dark unfinished final novel, ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"".  Rains is hopelessly infatuated with Rosa Budd played by Heather Angel, the fiance of his nephew Edwin Drood, played by David Manners.  Unknown to him they've mutually cancelled their arranged union.

Rosa had fallen in love with Neville Landless played by Douglass Montgomery, newly arrived from Ceylon to Cloisterham with his sister Helena played by Valerie Hobson.

In a jealous rage Rains kills his nephew Drood and entombs him in the catacombs courtesy of information supplied to im by the drunken caretaker Durdles played by Forrester Harvey.  Rains implicates Montgomery for the crime.  Rains' treachery however, will not go unpunished.

Of note was thr familiar looking face of Zeffie Tilbury playing the Opium Lady.  Upon investigation she was the same actress who played Grandma in a classic 1936 Little Rascals short.",1162857600,19,1016,5.345911949685535
781440,4,6304119011,"My expectations weren't very high for this movie.  I was expecting it to be much like THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE, having a few creepy scenes, but no good acting to make the rest of the movie interesting.  EDWIN DROOD, however, succeeded on all levels.  It was surprisingly funny (usually intentional) and light in certain scenes, and suberbly moody and dark in the others.  The acting was excellent.  I was especially impressed with Douglass Montgomery as Neville and Zeffie Tilbury as the old opium lady.  But, if you're like me, you'll pick up this movie because it stars Claude Rains.  And you won't be disappointed!  If you think Claude Rains is talented at playing creepy, wait until you see him playing stoned and creepy!",982886400,58,721,4.852459016393443

7861866,5,6304119011,"Dickens' last, unfinished novel is a true mystery since the author did not get a chance to reveal the killer.  But it does point certain ways.  However, in BLEAK HOUSE  he points directly to two likely murderers and, off to the side, the third and actual killer.  The actual comes as a bit of a surprise.  I can see Dickens setting up the same sort of scenario here--had he lived long enough.  But he did not and we must work with what he wrote.  This movie follows the clues as written.  Fine performances,  especially by Claude Rains.  My favorite eccentric is Durdles!  Durdles stuck to me long after I saw this film on the late show in the '70's. Very atmospheric, with a stunning beginning.",1437436800,3,695,4.48

7861869,3,6304119011,"I must say straight off that I do not approve of this trend by the film companies of making classic films available only on DVD-R just because they are on the obscure side; any film based on a Dickens novel--especially his mysterious, unfinished final novel--and starring the legendary Claude Rains deserves A-List treatment!  As in most DVD-R's, there are annoying moments when the movie freezes and/or skips. Unacceptable.",1424304000,4,424,5.235294117647059
