1372703,2,B00004Y7DE,"I love the quirkiness and daring of Hal Hartley but I must admit that I do not intend to keep this one in my collection.
Having said that, a negative review would not have stopped me
from seeing this film.  I enjoy the difference that Hartley
brings to film.  I watch the short ""Surving Desire"" regularly
and I also love ""Simple Men"", ""Trust"" and ""Henry Fool"".
  Basically, I wasn't convinced of the necessity of the
camera contortions and I didn't follow what he ws trying to say
through his charachters.  Hartley's technique walks a fine line
in his films and sometimes a viewer simply says ""Oh, please!""
  Didactically, I don't think you can learn anything in ""Book
of Life"" that hasn't been said in his other films.
  Of course, if you're a Hartley fan like me, you'll see this regardless.  You won't let a sourpuss detur you from your curiousity.
  Either you'll feel slighlty burned like me, or you'll love it and change your life.  I wish you the best.",1015459200,4,959,4.570588235294117

1372705,4,B00004Y7DE,"One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on December 31, 1999.  In ""The Book Of Life,"" writer/director Hal Hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium Armageddon, beginning with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Year's Eve, `99.  The story examines the task of the Son of God, who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the Book of Life (now contained in a Mac laptop computer), in which there is also the names of the one-hundred and forty-four thousand good souls who will be spared on the last day.  Jesus (Martin Donovan), along with Magdalena (P.J Harvey), arrives in New York City to make the preparations necessary for carrying out his Father's will, but he begins to have second thoughts; must he judge the living and the dead?  Do they deserve what must befall them?  It is a cup He would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment, which gives encouragement to Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) who fears that the fruit of all his hard labor is about to be washed away at midnight, for he can only continue his work so long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams.  An artistically rendered, high concept film, Hartley presents the story in an intelligent, thought provoking manner, taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter so as to make it inoffensive even to the most ardent fundamentalist.  The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating, as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their corporeal stay in the city.  It's an engrossing meditation on the spiritual side of Man's fragile existence and a contemplation of that which has been prophesied in the Revelations of St. John in the Apocalypse, the last Book of the New Testament.  And there is logic in Hartley's approach to the Second Coming; he maintains the aesthetic of the contemporary setting while employing altered film speeds which visually give the film an ethereal quality.  Christ inconspicuously wears a suit and tie, effectively blending in with the populace, while Satan's attire is a bit more casual, his appearance somewhat scruffy; he sports a bruise above his left eye.  Donovan is well cast as Jesus, lending a benevolent mien and a sense of restrained urgency to his character that is very effective.  It is, of course, a unique portrayal of The Saviour, and possibly the best since Max von Sydow's in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told.""  He successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and tranquility, of serenity, that is the essence at the very core of the character.  And Ryan is thoroughly engaging in his role of the Prince of Darkness; he has a distinct manner of speech and a resonant quality to his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch.  His eyes are darkly penetrating, a trait he uses effectively with furtive glances and captivating stares.  He's the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you.  It's a memorable performance that contrasts so well with Donovan's portrayal of Jesus.  The supporting cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (Lawyer), James Urbaniak (True Believer), Katreen Hardt (Lawyer's Assistant) and Anna Kohler (Hotel Clerk).  In his own, inimitable style, with ""The Book Of Life,"" Hartley has crafted a perspective of the last days that is interesting, entertaining and truly unique.  He has a way of capturing life as it is just off center, a method which works especially well with a film like this.  Comparatively short for a feature film (running time of 63 minutes), it nevertheless is one of Hartley's best, and more than worth the price of admission.  It's a film that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things you may have tucked away in a corner of your mind for later.  And that is part of the attraction of this film; it makes you realize that ""later"" most likely is now.",983750400,14,4052,4.790229885057471
1372706,4,B00004Y7DE,"This is a superb film by Hal Hartley. Part of a European project on views of the millenium, Hartley submits a film that only an American could make.  It is very slick, due in part to his use of digital film.  The music  complements the scenes perfectly (and the soundtrack makes a great CD  too!).  The movie traces an introspective Jesus on New Years Eve trying to  end the world (think of it as the old black and white The Horn Blows and  Midnight redone for the 21st century).  In presenting the story the movie  is a travelogue for NYC- and has an excellent NY feel- from the hotel bar,  to the times square music store, to the Russian restaurant (note that the  lights say TRUTH and FAITH in Russian) and in the street.  It is uniquely  American (in the millenium film group) in that it plays off the city, the  law, and the business deal to make its point.
This movie humanises  Jesus, but at the same time avoids the intentional controversy around, say,  a Last Temptation of Christ.  In addition, the character of the devil is  really a joy to watch.  This movie will make you think.
The only weakness  is a rather sappy ending.  I suppose it is a tricky film to end, but I  found all but the last 5 minutes on the staten island ferry to be  wonderful, but those last five were really not worthy of the rest of the  film.",968198400,10,1329,4.287449392712551
1372707,4,B00004Y7DE,"It is the rare indie film that a)is funny in a droll way b)is thought provoking c)is especially interesting for biblical scholars d)that is both directed by Hal Hartley and is short and e)manages to squeeze in a Yo La  Tengo cameo.  Such,  however,  is Book Of Life,  a film that posits a  kinder,  gentler,  Armaggedon.  Jesus Christ arrives at the airport  December 31,  1999.  He's expected to open the 4th-7th seals on the Book of  Life,  thereby unleashing Armageddon.  He begins to have second thoughts,  however,  as he looks around and examines humanity.  This causes trouble  with God's lawyers.  Besides the uniformly excellent writing,  this movie  also recalls Michael Almereyda's Hamlet,  in that both movies hold special  delights for those well-acquainted with the source material.  The movie,  shot on a digital camera,  doesn't suffer for it.  For Hartley fans,  well  worth the investment.",967680000,10,907,5.097222222222222
1372708,5,B00004Y7DE,"The concept of Jesus in a suit walking around Manhattan is interesting, and PJ Harvey is fantastic.  This was one of my favorite 1990's indie films about the apocalypse, the other one was The Rapture, and those two films couldn't be more different.  However, they're both thought-provoking to this day, even though the Year 2000 (and associated beliefs that it would bring the end of the world) has come and gone.",1290643200,,413,4.802816901408451
1372709,5,B00004Y7DE,"Synopsis: It's a New Years Eve unlike any other. The date is December the 31st, 1999 and spiritual forces are afoot in the affairs of man. Jesus (Martin Donovan), looking like any other normal 20th century businessman has arrived at JFK airport accompanied by a lovely female assistant (P.J. Harvey) named Magdalena (aka: Mary Magdalene). He has come to fulfill what has been foretold, open the final three seals locking the Book of Life and judge the living and the dead, thus ending time and beginning eternity. No one recognizes this new arrival for who he is except for a crazy or two and of course the Devil who knows his time is short and is busy trying to gather one more soul before the curtain falls.

However Jesus surprises everyone with his ambivalence towards his Father's instructions. He likes humans, being half-human himself, and doesn't see the need for petty retribution. Will he carry out the will of his heavenly Father or make his own deal with the Devil so that mankind can continue into the new millennia?

Released in '98, the film captures all the angst and personal torture of a generation lost and unable to cope with the impending transition. Will the next millennia be better than the last? Will we even survive long enough to experience the next thousand years? Hartley has created for our viewing pleasure a highly provocative tale complete with a well-conceived script, taut and pointed dialogue and a mesmerizing soundtrack ranging from urban, industrial sounds to bittersweet melancholy. `The Book of Life' is truly a cinematic meditation of the highest order.",1177804800,3,1595,4.925650557620818
1372710,5,B00004Y7DE,"I just saw this movie, and after seeing Trust and Unbelievable Truth, I am convinced that Hal Hartley is well worth following.  This is one of those movies that makes your eyes grow wider and your breath come a little faster, as you watch in facination.

  The filming is very edgy, using a lot of camera movement, overexposed shots, and some interesting angles.  The story of Jesus returning to begin the apocalypse is now told in a manner that is truly original, with almost continual tongue-in-cheek humor, and situations that are so absurd as to be believable.  While others have dealt with the end of the world in dark and dismal ways, Hartley leaves us with hope.  Hope for mankind, and just as importantly, hope for the future of film.  That someone can continue to make films that challenge the mind like this makes me feel better in the wake of the crap that Hollywood continues to spew.

  I would recommend this film to those who are not afraid to see something that will push your comfort zone.  If you are adventurous enough, then you will enjoy this one.  If you do not like going out of your comfortable little world, then do not, under any circumstances, see this film.",1168041600,,1185,4.585714285714285
1372711,5,B00004Y7DE,"""Do YOU believe you have a soul?"" Comparatively, Hal Hartley's apocalyptic ""The Book of Life"" seems far more relevant today than it did just several years ago reflecting late 90s Y2K hysteria as we approached the end of the millenium. An illusory state of grace? Hey, God only knows.

In this retelling of the Apocalypse, PJ Harvey as Magdalena, and Jesus and Satan, played by indie actor extraordinaires Martin Donovan[Trust, Saved!, Hollow Reed] and Thomas Jay Ryan[Henry Fool], gather to contemplate and debate God's endtime wrath as Jesus opens the remaining few of the Seven Seals, unleashing his father's final fury on mankind - by way of computer, naturally.

Luckily for mankind, however, ole peacenik Jesus doesn't quite share the same zeal for divine vengeance as his Old Man, and threatens ultimate rebellion by refusing to engage in such dirty work. ""Panicked by both the legitimacy and hopelessness of their cries, I rose to the occasion, and lied.""

Much like the compelling and disturbing movie ""The Rapture,"" this unique telling relies heavily on dialogue, while using visuals to imply our perception of reality blending into a stream of familiarity which blinds us to elementary truths. We're given what we interpret to be the human aspects within the conversations, inner reflections, and cut-away monlogues of Jesus and Satan...

Satan: Are you saying what I think you're saying?

Jesus: I won't judge the living and the dead. I hate this exclusive ""closed door"" policy. Who do these ""christians"" think they are anyway?!

Satan: My friend, you speak heresy...worse, revolution.

As one might expect, some of the more substantive dialogue is attributed to Ole Scratch, done with the appropriate undertones and dramatic flourishes of Thomas Jay Ryan [if you haven't seen Henry Fool, by all means, do], illustrating his simultaneous melancholic sympathy for, and mocking resentment toward mankind.

His sights are set on claiming a final soul before The Big Day, and settles on a man who, in seeing a large commerical airliner pass overhead in NYC, sees a sinister omen of things to come. They go into a diner, strike up a conversation, but it's merely child's play for Lucifer; some thinly veiled maneuvering as he tempts the man. Yet, as the two debate Big Issues, how odd it is to hear Satan arguing *against* the concept of Love as a basic survival mechanism of our species:

""So if we're all just biological accidents, how do you explain Love?"" ...""I can imagine all too well, that's my problem. I can imagine everything too well; a person's capacity for sacrifice, someone's life ruined by a simply misunderstanding, the possibility of disaster in just reaching out to shake somone's hand, the crippling of a person's self esteem by an overheard remark....how can I be responsible for all of that?

Every intimacy engenders expectation, and every expectation, some unknown disappointment.""

That's some pretty good stuff. Definitely a metaphysical intriguer to be enjoyed, if you're in tune at all. It's also funny seeing Martin Donovan as a reflective Jesus in this, compared with his recent role in the satirical ""Saved!;"" ""...Let's get our Christ on!"" Likewise recommended viewing.",1141257600,4,3206,5.1226053639846745
1372712,5,B00004Y7DE,"I must admit at first I didn't enjoy the film, but after having watched it 4 times I managed to understand the film and derive meaning - the dialogue is just as important as the other film production techniques in the book of life - characterisation is superb and story development was commendable

I recommend this film greatly",1115856000,,328,4.655172413793103
1372713,5,B00004Y7DE,"Living in England, I doubted I would ever get to see this short, let along actually own it. This is a multiregional release, so us Limeys can purchase the DVD as well as you darned Yankees. The film itself is only an hour or so, but succeeds on every level - there's not an ounce of fat on it. A freewheeling take on millenial apocalypse, it stars Hartley veteran (and all round object of desire) as, appropiately, God versus Thomas Jay Ryan's delicious Satan. A superb supporting cast including PJ Harvey (a revelation) and Hartley's better half Miho Nikado help bolster this humorous and theologically inventive piece into the realms of pure cinematic joy. Thomas Jay Ryan's Satanic deliveries to camera are superb. His best film? Quite possibly. Go on, shoot me. Reccomended without hesitation to all.",1082332800,6,804,4.875912408759124
1372714,4,B00004Y7DE,"I bought this DVD a couple years ago. Being a PJ Harvey fan, I was curious to see her acting debut. Well, turned out to be her only role actually, as she hasn't acted since. She did a fine job, certainly didn't embarrass herself anyway. I was familiar with Hal Hartley, but hadn't seen anything by him prior to this movie. I've since seen 'Henry Fool' and enjoyed that. The same lead in that film plays Satan in this film and does a good job. He's quite amusing.
My initial reaction to this film was a little indifferent. Somewhat amusing and interesting, but not much beyond that. I've watched it several times since then, in bits and pieces mostly, and I enjoy it much more now.
I do share some of the complaints about the jerky camera motion, which gets annoying quickly for me. I like some of the other unique touches, like the microphone set-up throughout the movie in various locations for the Devil to pontificate from. It was a risky maneuver, but it works here.
I thought the last scene was quite touching, with Jesus on a barge, tossing the ""book of life"" into the water as he contemplates the fate of mankind. That speech makes me tear-up everytime!
For those interested in getting the DVD, just be aware that there are no extras on this disc. Maybe that's good news. I know sometimes I find the extras to be a burden as you feel obligated to watch all the extras. I strongly endorse the soundtrack (if you can find it). Lots of good stuff there.
If you are a fan of either Hartley or PJ Harvey for that matter, I see no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie. I really think it's worth owning too, if you are a big fan of either.",1075852800,5,1644,4.358306188925082
1372715,4,B00004Y7DE,"Martin Donovan (Trust) plays Jesus and Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) is the Devil as the clock ticks down on the last day of the world in Manhattan.  Jesus agonizes over unlocking the seven seals of the apocalypse on his Apple laptop, verbally battles the Devil, and walks around NYC with Magdalene (PJ Harvey) on this most eventful of days.
This is a typical Hal Hartley film -- incredible premise, great actors, and creative but cheap production.  I enjoyed the film even though the glaring lights and jerky camera got old -- at just over 60 minutes you don't have time to get too annoyed :-)
Extras are minimal -- credits and filmographies for Hartley and Donovan.
A worthwhile addition to Hartley's ouevre but as often happens with this talented director, one feels that the potential was greater than the execution.",1054684800,2,819,4.801418439716312
1372716,5,B00004Y7DE,"If you don't like Hal Hartley, this film will not change your mind. It is more abstract, more talky and even more cheaply made than most of his stuff. But it is Awesome! It's basically Jesus (Martin Donovan) up against Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) battling it out for the souls of men on New Year's Eve 1999-Armageddon. Jesus, as played by Donovan, is a self-doubting, earnest, hard-working, God-Fearing(pun intended),normal guy with the weight of the world on his conscience. Satan, as played by Ryan, is like an extra sleazy used car salesman, not to far off from Ryan's title role as Henry Fool. The two of them have excellent verbal battles which are as funny as you might imagine. Jesus's best line come when he says to Satan, ""you know, it's not that you're so dispicable, it's just that you're so damn trite"". It's almost as if the actors are speaking to each other... Throw in funny Mormon jokes, an appearance by PJ Harvey, as Jesus's assistant, and digital video style for miles and miles and you have the best one hour independent film about the Apocalypse ever made.",1039651200,8,1073,4.682539682539683
1372717,3,B00004Y7DE,"At first I didn't like this film. It was too artsy, too frumpy, too fuzzy. Far too fuzzy. Frankly I bought it because I am a big PJ Harvey fan, no surprises there right? But after watching it a few times I begain to find importent and often funny moments. The interaction between Jesus and the Devil are often quite amusing.
  The acting is lacking. Donovan has done better work in my opinion(Nadja, for example). PJ Harvey is surprisingly good, speaking as a critic and not a fan, perhaps the best actor in the film really besides maybe Thomas Jay Ryan. As for her looking like ""Jack Skellington"", as my friend pointed out, well she has always looked that way.
  If you like independent films or are an art student then this is a good choice for you.",1017187200,3,751,4.420289855072464

This film could be described many ways. None of them would be wrong. None of them would be accurate.

The script is fantastic. The acting couldn't be better conceived or executed. The videography, revolutionary for its time and surpassing presumed limitations of digital tapetape, ranks in sheer beauty alongside Solaris. God's attorney and his paralegal shoot it out with Mormons.

7926906,4,B00004Y7DE,"Hal Hartley is the most original and talented independent filmmaker of the last 25 years. His movies are philosophical, witty and hip--his ornate and deadpan dialogue is provocative, aphoristic and very funny. These two movies are both genre-bending forays into science fiction--as filtered through Hartley's comic sensibilities. The Book of Life imagines Jesus returning to Earth in 1999 (accompanied by PJ Harvey as Mary Magdalene) and quarreling with the Devil over the fate of humankind. The Girl From Monday is set in a dystopian future where corporations control the human soul. Both are shorter films shot on Hi-Definition video--the look of both films is a little jarring at first, but Hartley's humane and witty take on our puzzling souls will inspire laughter and late night discussions with your fellow cinephiles.",1400803200,2,825,5.3538461538461535

7926908,5,B00004Y7DE,"I missed this movie when it was released, and then forgot about it until finding it favourably mentioned in William Gibson's recent collection of essays, ""Distrust that Particular Flavor.""  The film is short, tightly edited and perfectly paced. The performances are brilliant(Donovan, Ryan and Harvey, in particular. Camera technique and music are perfectly matched to each scene.
Despite its brevity, ""The Book of Life"" manages to work in some quasi-cryptic nuggets of Biblical reference (not that I'm an expert) beyond those dealing with Apocalypse. These feature uncredited (and what seem to be unacknowledged and non-verifiable) performances by actors of note. Obvious, of course, is the opening sequence in which Martin (Jesus) calms the madman at JFK. Then there is the scene in which Jesus needs to phone Satan (Ryan) from a pay phone. He turns to a woman clad in a purplish-red coat and purplish-brown hat. She is carrying a tray filled with cups of coffee (or something). He asks her for a quarter so he can make the call. Without a word, she hands him one. Then she watches and briefly seems to eavesdrop as he speaks with Satan. When the call concludes, the woman hands Jesus one of her cups. He takes it, asking her if she works for ""a charity organization"" (her clothing reminds one of a mission uniform). She does not. She is, she says quietly, and in a soft and kindly voice that seems as familiar as her face, that she is merely ""rich. . .very rich"" and walks away. The scene recalls the story, found in the Book of Acts, of Lydia, a merchant of purple cloth and an early convert to Christianity. Watch the movie a couple of times and you may spot another reference or two of this type.
A mid-film scene in which Satan discusses the likely future of humanity and Jesus' closing series of futuristic questions demonstrate why ""The Book of Life"" continues to fascinate those with interests in science, religion and philosophy. This film's ""legs"" may also be due in part to the fact that it is less technologically dated than many of its contemporaries--despite the pay phone!",1348444800,2,2089,4.818941504178273
