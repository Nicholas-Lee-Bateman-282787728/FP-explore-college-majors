2081318,1,B0002EJ7ZI,"One is the least rating possible.

The copy provided was in black and white, despite the representation that it was in color.

The full-head mask is apparently true to the original Zorro character, but the story in ""The Bold Caballero"" is set in Santa Cruz!

The portrayal of Californian Native Americans is of particular interest.

The stilted and generally poor acting, low production values, poor quality of the copy all recommend a pass on this one -- as in: you should skip it.",1402531200,,482,4.771084337349397
2081319,5,B0002EJ7ZI,"I love Zorro movies and this one was not a disappointment.  Very good movie, I enjoyed it very much and recommend it..",1398124800,,118,4.363636363636363
2081320,4,B0002EJ7ZI,"A change from the usual action packed bloody movies.  I  would recommend this movie to all, so they can enjoy the change of pace!
Lots of action really, but you also use your imagination!",1397088000,,187,4.470588235294118
2081321,4,B0002EJ7ZI,"I've been a fan of Zorro since I first saw ""The Mark of Zorro"" with Tyrone Power.  I've read the book, watched the Douglas Fairbanks version, and seen the Disney series with Guy Williams.  I know that's by far not all the versions ever made, but those are some of the best.  This one ranks fairly close behind them.  It captures the dashing and intelligent hero well, and his lady is a bit more spirited than some.  I feel like it could have been a longer film, with a bit more character development given, but it uses the time it has pretty well.  This movie is not as light-hearted as some versions, though it stays clear of too much darkness as well.  I thought the characters remained in character and behaved as they would have for most of the film, barring a couple of decisions - though perhaps both love and anger can make people act irrationally.  All in all, good stunt work, good writing, nice filming, and a good-triumphs-over-evil ending, which is the best kind.",1383523200,,975,4.5
2081322,4,B0002EJ7ZI,"Republic Pictures presents ""THE BOLD CABALLERO"" (1 December 1936) (67 mins/B&W/Color) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Bob Livingston starred in several serials, ""THE VIGILANTES ARE COMING"" (Republic, 1936) and ""THE LONE RANGER RIDES AGAIN"" (Republic, 1939) --- Livingston also had the distinction of starring in Republic's first color film, ""THE BOLD CABALLERO"" (Republic, 1936) --- During the 1920s Doug Fairbanks had brought to life on the screen the great Spanish crusader, ZORRO --- This classic silent feature broke box-office records when it was shown.

It was Nat Levine who got the idea of resurrecting this black masked hero once again on the silver screen --- Owning the screen rights to the ZORRO character, Republic Pictures great script department busily came up with an exciting ""THE BOLD CABALLERO, with Livingston in the starring role --- Filmed this feature in color, it's very first in this media --- Put Livingston in the movie record book as being the only actor to portary ZORRO in color at the time and also as the first ""talking"" Zorro.

Under the production staff:

Nat Levine  - Producer
Jack A. Marta  - Cinematographer
Alvin Wyckoff  - Cinematographer

Bob Livingston fought and rode his way through this exciting film and to add more thrills, he was doubled by ace stuntman Yakima Canut who handled the daredevil stunts and dangerous scenes --- Two masked character roles in a short period of time - it was the beginning of another prestigious honor, Bob in his screen career would hold the distinction of being the only star to wear the most variety of masks in westerns -- more than any other screen actor.

2081323,3,B0002EJ7ZI,"Female cowboy rider dressed in black whips outlaws into submission. What is this, kinky vintage pornography from the 1940's? Shoot, it's just another western serial, and a rather lame one at that. When crime fighter The Black Whip dies, his sister discovers his secret identity, and assumes the black outfit, whip and horse of the famed do-gooder. The poor beautiful and bland girl assumed none of his better acting style. Horses and third string outlaws upstage her.

Trip wire horses, trot-galloping turned up fast speed, a movie-set hideout underneath a waterfall, and an earnest history lesson on fighting for justice to insure Idaho becomes a state. Where do I get the medal for sitting through all twelve episodes? The best thing, the only thing about it, is the assured camera work of close-up stunt riding.

But hold on, partner. There's gold in these hills in the form of bonus feature, ""The Bold Caballero"", a 1936 Zorro classic with Robert Livingston as the legendary crude artist, and Heather Angel, as his royal seniorita, dabbling in daring escapes, sassy swordplay, slapstick humor and yes, enough romance to snap a whip at.",1170460800,,1139,5.021164021164021
2081324,5,B0002EJ7ZI,"Although only briefly noted in the title heading of the Amazon.com (and Image Entertainment) rundown, this Hal Roach Studios 35mm nitrate DVD restoration of ZORRO'S BLACK WHIP contains, as a special bonus, the complete and long-unseen original ""talking"" Zorro feature film, THE BOLD CABALLERO. Personally produced by Zorro creator Johnston McCullough for Republic Pictures in 1937, this 68 minute film is essentially the ""first version"" of the Zorro feature made by 20th Century-Fox a few years thereafter which starred Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell. This bonus feature stars Robert Livingston (Of ""Three Musqueteers"" fame) and Heather Angel, and tells the basic Zorro fable still familiar today after many re-makes. Mastered from the surviving red element of the original primitive two-color negative. Not available elsewhere! The DVD runs over four hours in length.",1090454400,13,868,5.583333333333333
2081325,5,B0002EJ7ZI,"In this movie, Zorro is framed as having killed the governor.  Diego woos the governor's daughter while she tries to find Zorro to kill him.  It is not the typical Zorro plot, but good, nevertheless.  I recommend this movie  to any Zorro fan.",949708800,4,242,4.558139534883721

8027160,3,B0002EJ7ZI,"Unimaginative but fast-paced Republic serial is a ""B"" Western with occasional whip-cracking action. Though Zorro creator Johnston McCulley receives screen credit, the 1944 chapterplay never mentions the swashbuckling hero. Instead, we get serial queen Linda Sterling as the vengeful (and unrelated) Black Whip  not a bad trade-off. Plenty of fisticuffs, hard-riding and a few nifty cliffhangers compensate for routine scripting. As a bonus, the Image DVD includes a decent black-and-white print of Republic's Magnacolor ""The Bold Caballero"" (fortunately, the two-color version exists). Released in 1936, the first sound Zorro adventure survives as a watchable curio thanks to its engaging cast.",1483315200,,694,5.94

And I truly enjoy black and white movies I've seen ZORRO since I was child.
Fighting oppression and tyranny and greed and of course the history of California.
When California was part of Mexico and when Spain had a hold in Mexico.
One has to remember movies we're much different then compared today.
And actors and actresses we're much more different in those days.
I would see this again and for others they will have to chance it and see it.
Those times and days are truly missed the innocence of the time.
When men we're men and singing to a woman was romantic and fighting for her honor.
And the respect of marriage my how times have changed.  The title of the movie was just right.",1445904000,,755,4.3546099290780145
8027166,4,B0002EJ7ZI,This was not the best Zorro movie I've watched but it was still very good and entertaining. I enjoyed Robert Livingston in the lead even though his love interest was not the best actress.,1422057600,,187,4.529411764705882
8027167,3,B0002EJ7ZI,"The audio was not very good; and it was not in color.  However, since we're history fans and were interested in seeing things related to early California, native Californians, and the missions [Some of Disney's Zorro episodes were filmed at a San Juan Capistrano], it was pleasant.  It also prompted us to look up info on the origin and history of the Zorro legend, which was good.",1419292800,,381,4.6716417910447765
8027168,3,B0002EJ7ZI,"I purchased this for ""The Bold Caballero"".  I already had the Alpha Video color-print DVD of the film, which is pretty good, but I'd hoped this black-and-white release might have an even sharper and cleaner print.  It doesn't.  So I recommend the Alpha Video release, unless you want the non-swashbuckler western ""Black Whip"".

""The Bold Caballero"" is an interesting and different Zorro film.  It was shot in two-strip Technicolor, if I remember correctly, so the color isn't vivid like three-strip Technicolor films (and in this release, isn't in color at all).  If you like Zorro tales, or swashbucklers in general, then you'll find ""The Bold Caballero"" of interest.  It's a well-paced, fun and funny film.",1414022400,,708,5.104347826086957
