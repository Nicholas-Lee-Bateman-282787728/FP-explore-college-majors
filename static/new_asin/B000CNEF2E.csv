We got married on one of this island's beautiful beaches last July, and fell in LOVE with Kaua'i I wanted a DVD that, not only showed the island's beauty, but honored the island by telling me more about it -- when I selected that mode, of course (some of information I knew, some I did not).  I am definitely pleased, and so was he!  :)",1276473600,4,507,4.142857142857143
8099420,5,B000CNEF2E,"I bought several DVDs of Kauai after visiting there. Somehow I got distracted and viewed all of them but this one. Today I put it in the machine to use as a background while I was reading. I selected the music, not the narration, and the music was very pleasant and nondistracting. However, once I glanced at the television screen, I put the book aside and watched the whole thing.

It was exactly the way I remember Kauai! The lush scenery, the wonderful beaches, one after another, the way we saw them as we explored the island. I was delighted! If you are planning a trip to Kauai, or if you've been there or only want to look at some beautiful scenery, this is a wonderful DVD. I recommend it.",1266710400,2,697,4.361538461538461
8099421,3,B000CNEF2E,"I viewed this DVD prior to visiting Kaua'i, and though it's a pretty standard travel film, the visuals were good and caught much of the beauty of the island.  The drawback of the DVD was the narration, which at times bordered on the downright corny.  After visiting the island, it was good to watch the DVD with only the musical soundtrack, avoiding the often trite and annoying comments of the narrators.",1233878400,4,405,4.690140845070423
8099422,5,B000CNEF2E,"It's a very pleasant, enjoyable documentary with both a lot of useful information and wonderful visuals of this beautiful island. The narration by two ladies, Tiger Lily Jones and Manulele is done in a charmingly carefree and joyous Hawaiian manner. Can't imagine a better narration.
I can't wait for their other films about other Hawaiian islands.",1231632000,2,348,5.232142857142857
