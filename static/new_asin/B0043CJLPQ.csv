4254974,4,B0043CJLPQ,I'm sorry I can't give you more information about this item - it is a good film - that's why I bought it.,1362787200,,105,3.608695652173913
4254975,5,B0043CJLPQ,"This a review of the disc, not the movie (a great remake of The Four Feathers by the same director.)  I ordered this on Amazon, along with Zarak, through other sellers, New, from ImportCDs. I watched this on my Blu-ray player and the sharpness of the picture is as good as a Blu-ray.  The movie is in its original widescreen aspect 2.35:1 - Not, 1.33:1 as shown in product details. You won't be disappointed if you buy this one.",1341187200,2,428,4.405063291139241
4254976,5,B0043CJLPQ,"This was one of the great adventure movies i saw as a teenager and have always wanted to see it again. Now here it is, available in beautiful technicolour and widescreen,you couldn't ask for a better presentation. I have also recently purchased the  criterion release of ""The Four Feathers""which to my mind was good but a  bit disappointing picturewise, not restored to the very high standard one has come to expect from this company. Of the two i frankly enjoyed Storm Over The Nile more, the story really lends itself to the widescreen and the actors are much more convincing than the stilted histrionics of Ralph Richardson and Michael Dennison totally unconvincing as romantic leads. Mary Ure is amazingly beautiful as the heroine and Anthony Steele and Laurence Harvey are strong heroes. What is really amazing is the skillful blending of a great deal of footage from the original film including the opening shot,indeed there is so much footage from the original film that i found myself wondering why they bothered to remake it, as it is a virtual scene by scene reproduction of the original. The answer i think is that it is bigger, brighter, and better,making the original film look like something of an antique. Both films however are a worthy addition to your dvd library",1328832000,2,1281,4.871559633027523
4254977,4,B0043CJLPQ,"Necessary or not... its a Remake of the ""Four Feathers"" from 1939 by the same Director, now in Cinemascope and with Terence Young as Co-Director.

Starring Laurence Harvey, Anthony Steel, James Robertson Justice and in a supporting role Christopher Lee (who became later famous as ""Dracula"" and in the newer time ""Lord of the Rings"").

This DVD is almost very good:

the Picture Quality is very good: clean and sharp (it looks so much better than the most Warner Archive or MGM DVD-R Releases)

Sadly: I'm missing english subtitles.

TRIVIA: THE MOVIE CONTAINS FOOTAGES FROM THE 1939 VERSION (INCL. THE FINAL BATTLE SCENE!!!)",1322784000,5,625,5.029126213592233
4254978,5,B0043CJLPQ,"The American Columbia Pictures copy of the original 1956 British London Films presentation of STORM OVER THE NILE on DVD is excellent in print quality.

Despite several well-known writers' negative comments (including one that the film is ""FEEBLE""), a viewing of the DVD the day it arrived here from AMAZON last week revealed as much entertainment value as when I first saw it at the WINTERGARDEN Theatre in Rose Bay, Sydney, in 1957.

The combination of footage from the earlier London Films version of THE FOUR FEATHERS from 1939, with the newly filmed footage with the newer (and excellent Fifties' British cast) was nicely done, and made the whole film a rewarding revisit and certainly an action-adventure well worth several further viewings in the near future.

Highly recommended for action fans and especially those favouring desert actioners.

By the way, the liner notes on the DVD state the music score is by Miklos ROZSA (who created the music for the 1939 version). Actually, the wonderfully rousing orchestral soundtrack is by the great Benjamin Frankel.  So who checks the archival information?

A CD of Mr Frankel's Soundtrack score would be a nice supplementary item for  Film Soundtrack fans, please.

Thank you Columbia Pictures/SONY for releasing this great Fifties treasure on DVD at last.

4254979,4,B0043CJLPQ,"I had seen this movie years ago and it got me interested in Chris Lee, which was before his Hammer horror.  And how can one not want to see Lawrence Harvey in a film tailored to his talents.  The PAL print is wide screen and beautiful.",1307923200,4,235,4.086956521739131

8414600,5,B0043CJLPQ,I now own all 4 of the release's of The Four Feathers and this by far is my most favorite. Has huge battle scenes and has been copied from a clean master film. The Colors are vibrant and picture is sharp. I love all 4 productions but if you only own one this is the one to buy. Even though the name is Storm Over The Nile it is an exact story line of the Four Feathers. Buy This Movie.,1443916800,2,385,3.825
8414601,5,B0043CJLPQ,"I think this is tied with the Jane Seymour version for a close second to the 1939 version. It tells the story of honor, courage and redemption very well.",1423180800,,153,4.310344827586207
