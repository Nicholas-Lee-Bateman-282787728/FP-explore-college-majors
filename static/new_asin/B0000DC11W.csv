I was an early and ardent supporter of Tom Ammiano.  I tabled, door-knocked, phone-banked, and dumped trash.  It was the first time I ever campaigned against a liberal democratic icon. It was one of the most inspiring campaigns I've worked on in my life.

This film is a fairly accurate and honest look at the race.  It is also an incredibly inspiring film about ordinary people with no money turning the political landscape of a major city upside-down.

Did we win? No. Did we shake the power structure? Yes.  We put Mr. Brown , the Democratic power structure, and his ""black shoe brigade""  [...]

A write-in candidate. Out-spent nearly 20-1, without the ability to threaten municipal employees (which Brown did, on the record, if they did not support him), and treated as a joke on the major networks, we forced California's most powerful and corrupt politician (at the time)into a ""fight for his life"" run-off.

I am as proud of working on Tom's campaign as anything political that I've ever done.  The film should be an inspiration to grass-roots organizers and insurgent politicians everywhere.",1281657600,,1117,4.956989247311828
8000534,1,B0000DC11W,"Since there's no photo or discription for this item, potential buyers should be aware it's a 50-minute video by NFL Films that purports to be ""a fascinating, close-up look at the high-stepping heroes of the NFL"" from the 1950s to the 1980s. I purchased a copy thinking I was getting a documentary with the same title about the 1999 mayoral race in San Francisco. My one-star rating reflects my disappointment over the mix-up; I never watched the NFL video. My comments are merely to prevent someone else from making the same mistake.",1116201600,,533,4.804347826086956
