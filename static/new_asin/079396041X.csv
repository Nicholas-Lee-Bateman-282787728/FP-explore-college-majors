The acting is first rate, and the characters misery and emotions just flow out of the screen . It bares the  human soul, from the cruelty of one Japanese officer to the compassion of  onother. A must see for those seeking to blame their problems on everyone  and everything else. See REAL suffering and realize how fortunate we all  are.",917308800,,446,4.337349397590361
158701,4,079396041X,"Paradise Road provides a moving story depicting the unfortunate women who were captured by the Japanese in the South Pacific during World War II. The women learn to live together and with the help of Adrienne Pargiter (Glenn  Close) and Margaret Drummond (Pauline Collins), the women form a vocal  orchestra which brings them even closer together and enables them to forget  their sad circumstances however briefly it may be. Cate Blanchett's  performance was noteworthy, as well. She portrays the strong-willed nurse,  Susan McCarthy. This film provides an excellent 'chick flick' as it shows  women bonding and overcoming the odds to survive. Close, Blanchett, and  Collins provide excellent performances, and it is worth seeing the film  just to see these remarkable performances.",915321600,5,783,5.413223140495868

158772,5,079396041X,"A difficult movie to watch.  It is the story of a group of female prisoners of war, held by the Japanese during WWII.  They form a choir and hum classical music.  Their actions and pride influence the Japanese, but that doesn't mean there is not a great deal of suffering within the camp.
Glenn Close is fabulous, as always.  I count her as one of the top actresses in America today, if not the top.  I will watch it again, but have to walk away from it for a time before I can do so.",1484784000,,484,4.052631578947368

158804,5,079396041X,"I love this movie. Besides being a true story,  it shows another side of WWII that is not always taught.

158805,4,079396041X,"This is a good, although slightly dramatised, story of the courage and fortitude of a group of Australian, British and Dutch women who endured brutal treatment at the hands of the Japanese during WWII.  These unfortunate women and some children were captured after attempting to evacuate from Singapore to Australia when their ship was strafed and bombed by Japanese aircraft.  This movie chronicles the brutality and general hardship of their captivity throughout the war and the amazing way they struggled to maintain morale by organising a choral group to entertain themselves and their guards.  The music in the film is taken from the surviving, pencil-written manuscripts that a couple of the women produced from memory. Aside from some minor stylistic weaknesses, one negative, expressed by Australian reviewers when the film was released, is that it omits the atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers against the Australian sailors and women of the army nursing corps who also survived the ship's sinking.",1476835200,,1013,5.3584905660377355

158901,5,079396041X,"Paradise Road is one of those rare movies which touch your heart. If you read the book WOMEN BEYOND THE WIRE you will hear the real story of those who suffered under the Japanese.  Paradise Road takes this book and  dramatizes it in a convincing and at times better manner.
Glenn Close is wonderful as usual.... the other meryl streep.  But Cate makes the movie.",1438819200,,362,4.538461538461538
158902,5,079396041X,"How could I possibly give Paradise Road anything less than 5 stars given the meaningful storyline, the terrific acting and the emotional rollercoaster ride concerning the fate of these brave female prisoners?  We're talking about an *extremely* moving storyline, and you know until the conclusion before the credits rolled I had no idea this was actually based on a true story.  It's true, there really WAS an all-female choir singing in a Japanese POW camp during World War II, and they were honestly singing beautifully.  Seriously I had no idea such beautiful music was being made in the early 40's.  I spent so many years listening to music from the 60's and 70's I just naturally assumed everything either originated or came together in those decades.  Awesome!

Anyway *all* the actresses in Paradise Road are brilliant.  Cate Blanchett, Glenn Close, Frances McDormand, Pauline Collins, Julianna Margulies, Jennifer Ehle, etc.  After a ship wreck leaves a group of women stranded in an ocean, they eventually reach shore, soon find themselves captured and end up in a POW camp with a variety of women from different countries such as England, the Netherlands, Australia and elsewhere.  They all have to work together and survive in a brutal camp where torture, rape, hard labor and violence are dominant.  To make matters worse, some of these girls don't get along.  I think the British considered the Dutch enemies but I don't know why.  All I could gather is that because they couldn't speak English they were considered untrustworthy.  If you read up on the Netherlands involvement in the war, it would appear they were in the same boat as many other European countries.

I swear the segment where the one Asian girl was dumped in gasoline and set on fire because she was caught communicating with outsiders (even though she thought she was in the clear) was one of the hardest segments to watch in the entire film, and I really hope this kind of extreme torture didn't REALLY happen.  The other hard to watch scene was the one where the brown poodle got shot because the leader of the camp, the *extremely* strict and merciless Clyde Kusatsu, shot the poor dog to send a message that all prisoners must obey his authority (because the girls were starting to get lenient and talkative which upset him).  You know how they say no animals were harmed in the making of a movie?  Well I didn't see such a notice with this film and it makes me wonder if that dog really WAS injured because the poor dogs reaction was WAY too realistic of an animal feeling an overwhelming sense of shock after getting shot.

A couple interesting things to note.  For the longest time the girls seemed to be optimistic that their time spent in the prison would be short, which explains the parts where they mention their goals and dreams upon release, and an assumption they'll be carrying out said goals.  They didn't stop to think they could be stuck in that camp for years.  Makes me wonder if that was the real reaction the prisoners had during WWII- a feeling of only being there temporarily.  They seemed certain that they'd be released soon.  Often times the girls communicate normally despite the physical abuse and death that was constantly surrounding them which seems unrealistic.  If I was in their shoes, I'd be spending most of my time living in fear knowing what the strict Japanese soldiers were capable of.  Setting people on fire?  That should have sent a STRONG message that I better do whatever they say.  So when the girls eventually write music to cope with the deplorable conditions they're forced to persevere on a daily basis, it didn't seem like -based on their nonchalant demeanors- they were living in *that* bad of a situation.  VERY strange!

Also the conclusion (SPOILER alert!) where the Japanese -after spending so much time causing nothing but hostility and violence towards the imprisoned girls, suddenly declare the war is over and that ""they can be friends again"" (the Japanese and the rest of the world).  Talk about a slap in the face!  Despite how strict Clyde Kasatu's character was throughout the movie, suddenly the war ends and he shows himself as defenseless and significantly more tolerable to the women he abused sexually and physically for the longest time without any compassion.  Strange reaction there!  Also the very beginning was the biggest head-scratcher in the film.  A bunch of high and mighty snotty people are enjoying drinks and normal conversations at a hotel party... while bombs are dropping down RIGHT outside, and they seem confident that they're protected inside the building and go about their business as usual.  What the!  That made ZERO sense!  And when they leave the building and head down the streets, they don't scream or show concern until they hear the bombs dropping close by.

Anyway, gradually these ladies start dying one by one due to diseases like malaria (and you could visibly see the swarms of bugs in the background whenever the sun shined a certain way- wow that's a lot of bugs).  Anyway it's an AWESOME sight seeing the Japanese guards noticeably affected and touched by the music these ladies were making.  It was a momentary and rare display of compassion.  It makes me wonder if the Japanese were really willing to listen to these ladies sing in reality.  I have my doubts.  In one scene a Japanese soldier was just about ready to attack one of the ladies with his gun when the choir suddenly breaks out into the most beautiful song ever, which encouraged them to stop their violent ways, listen and be touched by the music.  That was a nice moment.  Hopefully it was accurate!

Overall what a film!  Paradise Road is one of those important films you must watch at least once in your lifetime.  The acting is really good, the storyline is amazing even though I wonder how much of it was exaggerated so as not to paint *too* much of a negative picture, and I highly recommend it.",1437523200,,5956,4.787463271302644

I put off watching this awhile after discovering it.  Witnessing these events is hard to believe, even after all these years, the news of 2014 is still bustling with diplomatic controversy over a memorial dedicated to 'comfort' women, a role taken on by some war survivors.

The drama can be shocking, whether it's the callous country-clubesque patronization of the colonial women towards their Asian hosts, right up until their own capture and interment forced them into an equal social status, or whether it's the horrid contempt of the Japanese officers for their Chinese prisoners.

Perhaps the humanity of the Japanese bears a little greater emphasis than what I watched in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windtalkers/dp/B000VI12ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windtalkers</a>&nbsp;, but it's precious little.

159018,4,079396041X,"I liked this film, although I can not really say it is a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

""Paradise Road"" tells the story of a large group of European, Australian and American women captured by the Japanese in 1941-42 and imprisoned in Belalau concentration camp (officially called an internment camp - but we soon learn enough to know better) on Sumatra. It is based on true story of women such as young Dutch student Helen Colijn, British missionary Margaret Dryburgh and Australian military nurses Betty Jeffrey, Vivian Bullwinkel, Pat Darling and Wilma Oram. Memories written by Helen Colijn (""Song of survival"") and Betty Jeffrey (""White coolies"") provided most of the scenario. The film describes all the period from early 1942, when the inmates arrive at the camps, to the September 1945, when the camp is liberated by allied forces.

Australian veteran director Bruce Beresford gathered for this film quite en ensemble cast - Glenn Close, Cate Blanchett, Julianna Margulies, Jennifer Ehle and Frances McDormand, to name just those most known - and put all this combined talent to REALLY good use. I especially liked the performance by Julianna Margulies, who actually outstaged Glenn Close, cast as main hero of the film...

This is a very watchable film, stepping proudly in the traces of its predecessors such as ""Three came home"", ""A town like Alice"" and of course ""Tenko"" series. Its particularity lies in the description of prisoners ""orchestra"" or rather chorus, which, under the direction of Margaret Dryburgh (in this film renamed Margaret Drummond), really performed classical music for inmates and even the Japanese guards from 1943 to 1945. ""Paradise road"" includes especially an incredible rendering of Dvorak's largo from ""New World"" symphony - for obvious reasons it is of course not the best ever, but it is the most touching I ever heard...

There is however one thing which makes it impossible for me to give this quite good film five stars - the director deliberately watered down the violence those brave women were exposed to and especially Japanese atrocities. Yes, there is one execution scene in this film, and starvation, disease and despair take their toll - but the real horror of Japanese concentration camps is NOT shown here. In fact, this film is so soft, that even the old ""Three came home"" made in 1950 (with Claudette Colbert as main star), shows more violence towards women... Honestly, I think that by deliberately censoring his own film and choosing to ignore almost all violence described by Helen Colijn and Betty Jeffrey, the director hurt ""Paradise Road""...

But still, this is a good film, with five great actresses in very unusual roles giving a great show and with some very touching and dramatic scenes. At 122 minutes this is a long film, but it doesn't feel long at all. A recommended viewing - but if you want to learn more about how horrible was the fate of women captured or enslaved by Japanese from 1941 to 1945, you can read the original memories by Helen Colijn and Betty Jeffrey and also - warmly recommended - those two books: ""The real Tenko. Extraordinary True Stories of Women Prisoners of the Japanese"" by Mark Felton and especially ""The Comfort Women. Japan's Brutal Regime of Enforced Prostitution in the Second World War"" by George Hicks.",1375747200,,3348,4.992831541218638

159052,3,079396041X,"""Paradise Road"" is based on the true story of a diverse group of women taken prisoner by the Japanese after the ship evacuating them from Singapore sinks. This group of women cope with their ordeal by forming a glee club of sorts and humming tunes from classical composers amid the horrors of the Japanese who torment them. Sound familiar ? If you think this sound like ""Playing for Time"" it does. Or if you think ""Bridge Over River Kwai"" then you are right again. The problem is, ""Paradise Road"" can't touch those films. Overly long and overwrought, the story is awash in setting but has little point. Director Bruce Beresford keeps the talented Cast looking earnest but never really hitting a nerve. Cate Blanchett, Pauline Collins, and Frances McDormand are OK, but Glenn Close, perhaps one of our greatest Actresses, is not in her element here. No one plays strong, tough, or unhinged women better than Ms Close, but she does not do as well as a victim, which is what she is here. We spend two hours wishing for her to channel Alex Forrest, Patty Hewes, or even Norma Desmond on her captors but instead she looks wide-eyed and weak.

Bruce Beresford made a sincere tribute to a group of imprisoned women of several nationalities confined in a concentration camp and how they decide to face the culture against the brutality; it's to say to return dignity against insanity in order to rescue what the human being is capable to do in certain circumstances as painful as this.

The only flaw that I found is that one leaves the projection, missing this sensation of epic triumph it really deserves.

I have found many opinions that -to my mind are unfair- intending to compare it with Schindler`s list. This comparison is ignoble and even irrevant.

159057,1,079396041X,"Wars are ugly business, as anyone who's witnessed more than news headnlines will tell you.  Millions of innocent civilians have been murdered, tortured and raped throughout centuries.  Despite international conventions and condemnations, war crimes continue to be committed.  Something about wars make even the most civilized people do the most barbaric things. Perpetrators of war crimes will always justify their actions as strategic necessity.  The Japanese have absolutely no excuse for what they've done during WWII, and these atrocities deserve to be condemned by history, by the same standards that condemn all other war crimes.

That being said, we Americans are in no position to point fingers at another country's dirty past.  We have a LONG list of war crimes consisting of mass murders, torture and rape of innocent civilians, and in fact, with victims vastly outnumbering those of Japanese war crimes.  Among them: torturing of Philippine POW in the 1920's; internment camp of Japanese Americans, mass murdering of German POW's, Hiroshima, in the 1940's; rampant murdering and rape in Vietnam; and very recently, torturing in Guantanomo.  These American atrocities have been well-documented, and some have been portrayed in Hollywood movies.

But in documenting our own war crimes, Hollywood never goes beyond the documentation itself.  That is not the case in Paradise Road, which follows the same modus operandi of a long line of similar movies. Beyond documenting the historically accurate atrocities, Paradise Road seeks to paint all Japanese as an INHERENTLY evil, insecure, foolish, barbaric and effeminate race.  Even when a few directors portray our own war crimes - Oliver Stone for example - they do not use these crimes (murder, rape) to leave the impression that Americans are fundamentally evil.  Why is that?

Paradise Road portrays the choir ladies as uniquely victimized by a uniquely despicable people.  If you study history, you will find Japanese war crimes are not unique. The only thing that's unique about Japanese war crimes is that they have been uniquely singled out to be repeatedly portrayed, and done in such a way as to suggest that they as a people are evil by nature.  Where are the movies depicting the Americans, the Serbs, the Sudanese or the Russians as fundamentally despicable people, because they committed horrific war crimes in the past?

Paradise Road employs a dishonest way to evoke sympathy.  More importantly, it falls in a long line of movies that promote unspoken phobias about the ""yellow horde"".  In short, it is a reflection of racial biases that continue to exist in our society.",1310688000,3,2643,5.237529691211401

When the movie was released on DVD, I eagerly bought it, as well.  To my disappointment, a couple of scenes were simply omited from the DVD.  One was the pivotal scene of triumph for the women in captivity who, having just buried one of their number, who was responsible for writing the musical scores used by the vocal orchestra, are taunted by the Japanese officer who had made their lives so difficult.  In response to his taunt about having no more music now that this woman was dead, the women pick up stones, sticks, and take off their wooden shoes and beat out the rhythm of Ravel's Bolero, which the vocal orchestra had sung.  It is their moment of triumph.
I tried to return the DVD to the store from which I bought it, but they would not allow a return or issue a refund, because it ""isn't our problem.""  I wrote to Twentieth Century Fox, but they did not show even the courtesy of a response.  Today, I decided to call them to try again to get the complete movie for which I paid in good faith.  The young man who spoke with me said, ""The DVD didn't say it had all the same scenes as the VHS.""  Since when does a DVD cover have to say, ""This is the complete movie, with no scenes left out?""  They certainly say when they contain extra footage.  He almost laughed when I suggested that they should, in that case, issue a refund.
I know perfectly well that if I should decide to copy one of their movies to give or sell to someone else, they would take legal action against me (if they were aware of it).

  These women prisoners who created a voice symphony, not a choir, were incredible.  They were brilliant and courageous.  It takes brilliance to recall and score music from memory.  It takes courage to stand up to your captors in order to create, practice and perform the music.  The music helped them have the strength to keep going day after day while being starved, brutalized, ravaged with diseases, all the while watching those around you weaken, sicken and die.  They continued until there just weren't enough voices to continue.

I hope so, you should cry when you see man's inhumanity to man in any way shape or form. But it's not depressing. This is a movie that somehow slipped through the cracks when it should have blazened across the airways. The acting- phenominal from everyone, the story- a true one- Inspriartional- made me want to make my life better. I could only rate this five stars, it deserves at least 100 stars.",1216425600,,927,4.2727272727272725

159079,5,079396041X,"The whole story is set in war-torn South-East-Asia during the attacking of the Japanese army.
The well-selected cast of actresses are giving this story a very sensitive nuance to understand the situation in the past and how women really show the way how to handle them. Men usually take weapons and try to attack the enemy with force, blood and terrorism.
But the women's way are far more better and their power to form a vocal choir in the prison camps shows their way to survive and even to attract the invaders.
The most touching point is the one when a Japanese soldier who accused a prison woman (played by fabulous Glen Close) tried to say Sorry to her when he sung a popular Japanese folk song far away from his subordinates.
This shows that soldiers are human too and they are also impressed about the women's power to survive by any means while the men prisoners from another camp tried to escape and returned dead.
The vocal songs are based on the original written papers which survived this time. And ""Paradise Road"" is still very actual in our today's time.

Their ""vocal orchestra"" (NOT a chorus, as their director, played superbly by Glenn Close, insists), achieves the seemingly impossible task of transcribing over 30 works, including Dvorak's New World Symphony (we hear a condensed version of the slow movement with a modern Dutch chorus on the soundtrack) via the prodigious memory of one of the prisoners, a British missionary (Pauline Collins), and through their performances in the camp transform the violent relationship between captor and captive into something approaching a human understanding.

If you doubt the truth of the horrible conditions to which allied civilian were exposed in the Pacific in the war, read  ""Prisoners of the Japanese"". The military camp commander and his subordinates are about as evil as one can imagine; it remains a mystery that much of Japanese society has yet to come to terms with these horrors.
Addendum: having just finished ""Hirohito and The Making of Modern Japan"" by Bix, the failure of Japanese society to come to grips with the horrors of 1937-1945 are not so surprising.",1104278400,6,668,4.808695652173913
159107,4,079396041X,"Right before the fall of Singapore in February 1942 a group of women, predominantly English but also including Dutch, Australian, and other Western nationalities, were evacuated on ship to Australia. However, when the ship is sunk they are captured by the Japanese and put in an internment camp. Over the rest of the war they suffer the attendant horrors of being the prisoners of the Japanese and they rise above their condition by creating a vocal orchestra, a chorus that performs hummed renditions of the works of Mozart, Dvorak, and Ravel.

There are certainly some memorable and harrowing moments in ""Paradise Road"" reflecting the brutality of life in a Japanese internment camp. Such horrors are supposed to stand in contrast to the beautiful music these women created in their prison camp by putting together a vocal orchestra. However, at the end of this 1999 film from director Bruce Beresford we learn that the vocal orchestra only performed for a couple of years before half its members had died, and we simply do not get the sense that things were that bad in this film, even though intellectually we know this must have been the case. As is pointed out, the Japanese do not like Europeans, prisoners, or women, and of course with these women we have all three. In contrast, one of the women refuses to hate her captors, explaining: ""I just can't bring myself to hate people. The worse they behave, the sorrier I feel for them.""

I suppose it is politically incorrect today to show the brutality the Japanese displayed in dealing with prisoners. The concept of surrender was an anathema to the Japanese and soldiers who surrendered rather than die in battle or kill themselves were seen as being without honor. With Holocaust stories there is a distinction to be made between the Nazis and the Germans, but the culture and political history of the Japanese do not allow for such a distinction. In the film the brutality is reduced to a couple of key figures, Sergeant Tomiashi (Clyde Kusatsu), called ""The Snake"" by the women, and Captain Tanaka (Stan Egi), who are portrayed as being basically sadistic, although ""The Snake"" becomes a symbol of the possibility of redemption in the film. Sab Shimono is Colonel Hirota, the camp commander, but he has little to say until the end of the film and simply symbolizes the power that must be obeyed. The focal character on the Japanese side becomes his interpreter (David Chung), who reminds me of the herald in Euripides' ""Trojan Women"": the man who must announce policies of which he does not approve.

It is important that the vocal orchestra be seen as an attempt to create grace and beauty in the depth of Hell, and not simply as a response to the long years of mind numbing prison labor. But I think that the extent to which that key connection is recognized in this film is up to the willingness of the audience to couch it that way. I also find myself wishing that there was more of the vocal orchestra performing (the music is performed using the original scores, which survived the war), and must admit I was survived there was not at least one montage contrasting the gloriously beautiful music with the indignities of life in that camp.

The one area where there is no room for complaint is in the stellar ensemble cast of actresses, most of whom appear for most of the film without makeup (in the everyday sense of the word). Glenn Close bring a strong sense of resolve and reserve to the role of the orchestra's conductor, Adrienne Pargiter, aided by Pauline Collins as Margaret Drummond, a missionary who is able to recreate the necessary sheet music from memory. Even without the makeup many of the faces are recognizable: Cate Blanchett plays Susan Macarthy, a nurse, Julianna Margulies is the American Topsy Merritt, who is tempted by the relative life of luxury offered to women who agree to be prostitutes for the Japanese, Jennifer Ehle is Rosemary Leighton-Jones, longing for her husband, Elizabeth Spriggs is Mrs. Roberts, who cares more about her status and dog than her daughters or anyone else, Wendy Hughes is the stoic Mrs. Dickson, Johanna ter Steege is Sister Wilhelminia, who wanted to be an engineer and not a nun, and Frances McDormand is Dr. Verstak, a German Jew who escaped the Nazis only to become the guest of their Eastern allies.

In the end ""Paradise Road"" is not as memorable as I might have hoped, but it is certainly worth watching and should not be dismissed as simply being a counterpart of sorts to the ""Playing for Time,"" about the orchestra comprised of Jewish women at Auschwitz. Even if it is inadequate to the task of creating truly transcendent moments, we certainly can understand and appreciate that once upon a time, in the real world, a group of real women actually achieved such moments.",1100908800,43,4802,4.773766546329723
159108,5,079396041X,"Paradise Road, has got to be the most moving War Time movie I have seen (the Patriot coming in at close second).
It is of a POW camp of woman in Sumatra who undergo terrible conditions where their own friends drop - one by one from disease, or perhaps execution. In spite of all this they still manage to show the barbarious Japanese that they still had some spirit left by forming their own vocal orchestra.
Cate Blanchett's performance is to be noted as in it she faces death were it left me in tears to watch her demise in the Pacific sun. She moved me incredibly and when I watched it I was sure she was my favourite actress.
Paradise Road is a must-see! If you have to see two films in your whole life-time watch this.... then watch it again! ;-)",1074470400,8,751,4.258741258741258
159129,3,079396041X,"This move is about civilian women and their children who were imprisoned by the Japanese armed forces during World War II.
 This movie affected me quite powerfully because I had read the book that was used as source material.  One of the female children who survived the prison camp lives here in New Jersey  and administers a juvenile reform facility.  In an interview in the local papers she described how she draws on her experience for perspective and how she tries to show her male, juvenile inmates how to adjust and succeed.  I clipped out the article and keep it between pages of the book.  My thoughts and feeling about the book and movie are too many and too complex for me to completely sort them out in a critical review.  What I offer here is a very crude sample of my reaction.  My focus here is more about the historical fact than about the art of the film.  Whereas the book is terribly moving, the film is not quite, but it is worth seeing.
 Few people know that during World War II, the Japanese had at least two prison camps where western, civilian women were kept.  One camp was in Burma and another in China.  The women were the wives of various businessmen, government employees, groups of nuns and Protestant missionaries.  They had stayed behind or were stranded when the war broke out.  Many of the women had their children with them in the camps.  They were from America, England, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands and other places.  There were a few Oriental and mixed race women and children also.  They tended to be the wives of diplomats or otherwise well connected to the wrong side.

 It happened that one of the women prisoners in the camp in Borneo, Agnes Newton Keith, was a professional author.  In the camp she secretly kept a diary, and when the war was over, she published a memoir, Three Came Home, describing her experiences.  It is a magnificent piece of writing, a minor classic in English literature.  The book, some letters, and interviews with survivors were the source material for Paradise Road.  There have been three previous movies from this material.  A movie titled, Three Came Home was made in 1950, and movies titled A Town Like Alice in 1956 and a remake in1981.
 In the film, the rivalry between the head of the camp and his subordinate are straight out of the book.  As characterized in the book, a few of the Japanese are decent human beings, but on the whole, though, they come across as completely ignorant and amoral.  They are young, dumb and don't want to be there.  The head of the prison had studied in the United States for a few years.  He had also read a book about Borneo that Ms. Keith had published before the war.  This connection helped her to survive.
In the movie, as compared to the book, the individual acts of brutality and torture against the women are exaggerated.  One of the women was reported for smuggling, and she is tied up and forced to kneel over a sword for 24 hours.  In the book, Three Came Home nothing like this happened.  Smuggling items back and forth with the locals was a regular, ongoing activity.  Interestingly, some of the younger nuns became the best smugglers.  I can just see some young nun having the time of her life doing this!
In the film, as you might expect, one of the Japanese guards tried to rape one of the women prisoners.  That part of the story was inspired by an event in the book, but in the book it was actually an incompetent attempt at seduction on the part of the guard.  The woman, Agnes Newton Keith herself, rebuffed him.  It became a big deal because she reported the incident as a rape attempt to the Japanese head of the camp.  The Japanese made a big stink about it; her accusation was considered an unthinkable affront to the honor of Japanese soldiers.

In the movie a number of women chose to become prostitutes rather than live in the camp.  That never occurred in the book.
I don't have a problem with the film showing greatly exaggerated acts of brutality.  The medium of film is very good at showing that sort of thing but not very good at showing the constant, day-after-day suffering from starvation for four years.  So it balances out.  Many died from malnutrition and disease.  That is only alluded to in the movie.  The one thing that stayed with me from the book was how much starvation Agnes Newton Keith was willing to suffer herself so that her son could eat a little more.  That was not depicted.  Her sacrifice was beyond heroic.  The filmmakers focused on the adult woman only, which I think was wrong.  With Agnes Newton Keith, probably the greatest amount of her mental energy and time was spent trying to acquire enough food for her son.
I don't mean to be kind to the Japanese.  Close to the women's camp was a camp where the male civilians were kept, as well as some military prisoners.  They were beaten and tortured often.
The center point and main symbol of the movie was choral singing that the women organized among themselves.  The choral singing in the movie is not in the book.
  In the book and the movie, there are a number of women with preposterous vanity.  Most of these women were from well-off backgrounds.  Many spent incredible amounts of time bemoaning the absence of men and the lack of cosmetics.  Some spend hours upon hours thinking about what dress they would wear when they are liberated.  In the camp cosmetics and dresses were bartered for various items.
The women were optimistic.  They knew that some day the Americans would arrive, and they did.

Within six weeks of the Japanese surrender, just about every Japanese officer from every prison camp was dead.  They committed suicide, were executed as war criminals, or just disappeared.  Ms. Keith relates an incident where, upon liberation, some Americans soldiers killed their former captors on the spot, with their bare hands.  If you read the book, you would have to pity for them.",1026604800,11,5923,4.602294455066922
