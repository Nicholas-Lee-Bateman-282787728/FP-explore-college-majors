524747,4,6302944775,"I think I counted only 13 or 14 spoken words in thismovie. There may have been fewer, I am not sure. Naturally, then, thisis a film you must watch to appreciate. It is remarkable what depthand nuance can be conveyed simply by looking at pictures on ascreen. A rather dreary tale is told here about a homely,wallflowerish girl who lives with her parents and works in a matchfactory. She gives her entire income to her family, but one day spotsa dress in the window of a shop and spends some of her earnings onit. She wears it to a club, where she is approached by a man for whatseems to be the first time in her life. ... Again, this is quite adreary film, but it was worthwhile to view it. Also it is a thoughtprovoking film in that it makes you evaluate the people who surroundyou... maybe perfect strangers that you see in your school orworkplace. They seem quiet, shy, unassuming, and the next day they aremurderers. In my high school years, actually, there were an alarmingnumber of people with whom I attended school who ended up beingconnected to murders in one way or another, and this film made merecall these sorts of feelings and thoughts, wondering about what goeson in people's heads to lead them to such rash acts.",982972800,4,1227,4.5565610859728505

7832439,4,6302944775,"Finnish film director Aki Kaurismki is one of those filmmakers whose idiosyncratic style is often referred to as an acquired taste. On the surface nothing big really happen on screen in his movies, but if you take a closer look, you will find that his films are in fact rich in emotions and surprises. His near dialogue-free feature film The Match Factory Girl is one of such movies.

The Match Factory Girl follows the story of Iiris (Kaurismki regular Kati Outinen, simply amazing), a lonely match factory girl living in her small world. As the long opening sequence of match factory machines suggests, her life is monotonous and uneventful.

That does not mean she does not feel anything. She goes to the nightclub and waits for someone to ask her to dance. No one seems to notice her. Undeterred, she buys a new dress (despite her unsympathetic step-father who disapproves). This time, she thinks she succeeds  though we know the man is not serious about the relationship.

The simple story is told in a measured pace, with occasional humor thrown in  humor that is so subtle (and dark) that you may not notice it is humor. Take a close look at the brief conversation over the counter when Iiris buys rat poison. We know what she is going to do with that when we notice slight changes in her voice and facial expression. By the time you look past her seemingly emotionless face, you realize what is going on inside her head, the heroines pent-up emotions that are very sad and lonely.

I am not sure The Match Factory Girl is Aki Kaurismkis best film, but perhaps his unique style is most apparent here.",1397692800,,1607,4.640845070422535
7832440,5,6302944775,"I have watched cult director, Aki Kaurism&auml;ki's strangely ethereal Finnish Film, The Match Factory Girl twice already and with each viewing, found the complete storyline from start to finish, to be held equally gripping. Here is a screenplay that commands a series of brisk, silent movements to obtain a life of their own. The narration is played out with a far more smouldering effect while using a muted tenacity, than would a taciturn script.

It is a dark film, deliberately clothed with a heavy, listless mood and fringed  with a sharp hint of psychological suspense. There are no theatrical effects, flamboyant scenes or mayhem spilled from high drama. Kaurism&auml;ki uses shadows, light, the sound of footsteps and also unusual objects like half-finished coffee in a tea-cup or a bottle of juice left on a table - where the camera may zoom in for a time - to create quiet curiosity in a viewer's mind. The dirt in a courtyard that leads to Iris's family's tiny flat or the luxurious extravagance of a modern kitchen, spill their own beans.  Yet, the screenplay promises to be memorable. The scenes although lacking humour and colour are slightly enigamtic in approach. It is far easier to remember the small cast of  startling unpolished characters - stony-hearted and selfish as they may be in their terrifying habits -  over the course of time than to forget them.

In this working-class story, possibly reminiscent of many families but with a grotesque difference, shown only towards the end. Kati Outinen plays a sullen factory-girl called Iris, who plods faithfully at a dead-end job, in a match production line. Iris appears the sad, classic loner with no personality and no friends. This appears evident when once in the film, Iris tries to engage a colleague in conversation as they sit smoking together, during an interval.  The dialogue is important to Iris who drops a personal secret. The listener, a pretty girl, replies in a decidedly bored tone and immediately proceeds to get up and walk away. Iris is left, staring into the distance.  Throughout the film, Irish wears her familiar deadpan expression that may lighten up only at the sight of a man asking her to dance or the idea of being caught in the rose-scented garden of romance.

But no Mills n Boons starry-eyed tale, comes to meet her. It is not easy to get any man to ask the plain Iris to dance...not even at the local club, where she sits alone nervously, waiting with a soft drink in her hand. In cafes too, in the few scenes that allow for this, Iris seeks solace from her beers, while in solitary mood.  In the background, is music from the 50s, a lively contrast to the flavour of the sober film.  The men that approach her are interested only in a host of sexual escapades. Things aren't good at home either...but my favourite scenes really were the splendid way in which Kaurism&auml;ki played out Iris's dull parents.

They are the champion couch potatoes, creating an impression of being addle-brained and constantly glued to the television.  The father has long quarreled with a son who lives away and the mother - although seemingly pretty in her time - looks exhausted and sluggish. They have no real relationship with their daughter and each day follows the same weary routine.  The only time the parents appear to come to life is when they demand Iris's wages and expect her to cook and clean. The mother makes an effort now and then, to offer Iris some warmth and affection when she spots her daughter's inner sadness. Yet, the prudish parent is also the catalyst for Iris's hardships later on when she believes that Iris may have caused a scandal in the family. It is the mother's decision and father's uncaring arrogance that provokes Iris to a terrible revenge later on.

From the rude man that Iris falls in love with to her hostile parents, there is never any consideration or kind conscience at Iris true feelings or wounded heartbreak. Humiliation is necessary when it has to be. No one thinks twice about stepping over Iris's toes with the exception of a kinder brother who appears briefly while halfway through scenes, to counsel and help.

Yet, there appears a superb decorum followed towards the end. Kaurism&auml;ki is extremely careful in keeping Iris's ruthless and vindictive actions low-key, in keeping true to the tone of the film. That even something horrifying could appear as nothing more than a tidy, everyday scene.",1363996800,2,4440,4.837730870712401
7832441,3,6302944775,"Aki Kaurismaki's 1990 film TULITIKKUTEHTAAN TYTT (The Match Factory Girl) caps a loose trilogy where the Finnish auteur explored the tribulations of lower-class lonely hearts. This Amazon listing describes a standalone DVD, but you can now get this film along with the other instalments of the ""Proletariat Trilogy"" in a Criterion Collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/box-set/dp/B001BEK8F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">box set</a>.

The protagonist of TULITIKKUTEHTAAN TYTT is Iris (Kati Outinen), a taciturn 20-something who still lives with, and financially supports, her layabout parents (Elina Salo, Esko Nikkari). Iris has no real social life to speak of, being ignored by co-workers and, at her nightly excursions to dance halls, by men. After meeting wealthy businessman Aarne (Vesa Vierikko), she thinks she has found happiness, but is cruelly abandoned by him and then her parents. Though she doesn't visibly snap, the pressures take their toll, and she gets her revenge on those who have done her wrong...

As the film progresses, radio and television in the background report the news of Chinese government forces suppressing the protest in Tiananmen Square. That overt political focus is something rather unusual for Kaurismki. He has usually included some criticism of state bureaucracy in his films, but here the film is entirely a metaphor for what might happen if the people are held down too hard and too long. Kati Outinen has one of the quirkiest faces in cinema, but here makeup and lighting accentuate those looks and she becomes the very image of misery.

TULITIKKUTEHTAAN TYTT fits with Kaurismki's general aesthetic in that the film features dcor and music from the 1950s, although it is ostensibly set in the present day. His penchant for minimal dialogue here is taken even further than usual. What sets this film apart from the rest of his output, however, is that it lacks his characteristic deadpan humour. Even when he focuses on the underdogs staying under, there's usually some chuckles in his work. Consequently, I found TULITIKKUTEHTAAN TYTT often unpleasantly bleak, less enjoyable than his other films. Nonetheless, the streamlined script and careful cinematography make this a film worth seeing at least once.
