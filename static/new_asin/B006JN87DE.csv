4993958,5,B006JN87DE,"I have been a Tribe fan for YEARS! I am SO excited for this to finally be coming out in Region 1 format! I even had facepaint at my wedding inspired by The Tribe. The acting is at times a little if-y, but the characters and plots and setting keep you going, you really get involved with the plot turns and relationships. LOVE the outfits and styles, they helped inspire some of my best looks. Definatly a wonderful childhood memory that I still watch as an adult. I cant WAIT for this to finally be released so us U.S. and Canadian fans can own it! Wish the entire series was coming out all at once, I would so buy that on day one!
I have season 1 in Region 2 format, but its hard cuz i can only watch it on my computer and sometimes it still doesnt read the discs right. Cant wait to pop these in to watch on my tv! (larger screen than computer, better resolution)

Power and Chaos!

4993959,5,B006JN87DE,Can it really be!? The Tribe on dvd in region 1 aka America!? This is the best news I've heard in ages! No more having to watch grainy/wavy region 2 dvds on crap bootleg region-free dvd players! I'm going to snatch this first set up as soon as it comes out! Cannot WAIT to own all 5 seasons. Really hope Shout! Factory will release all 260 episodes. This show is awesome!,1327968000,5,371,4.23943661971831
4993960,5,B006JN87DE,"Think of Mad Max meets Lord Of The Flies. Don't let the costumes, hair colors and makeup fool you. This show somehow pulls you in and makes you care about the characters and the world there now living in. For every teen that thought the world would be a better place without adults and think they could do a better job, think again. This is the world of THE TRIBE. How long could you live off tinned food (caned food) before you would have to organize farms? How would you get kids to work on a farm? Do you pay them? If so, with what? Or do you use kids as slaves? Who do you go to when you get sick? What to you do when all the antibiotics run out? All these and more are things that come up in THE TRIBE.

I have all 5 box sets that I bought from Amazon UK years ago, but now I plan on getting the USA version too.",1324339200,15,817,3.8922155688622753
4993961,5,B006JN87DE,"I started watching this show back in 2002 i believe, maybe just before that.  It became an intricate part of my life and i loved every minute of it.  I got many friends addicted to the show too.  so happy that it is finally being released in the USA.  I have the UK dvd's but the USA ones are going to be top of my list and i can't wait to get them.  Watch it and you won't be disapointed!",1323993600,,389,3.8125
4993962,5,B006JN87DE,"I have been a fan since the show was first put on air. I was over joyed when I got the news that the DVD was coming out in the US. This show means a lot to tons of fans around the world. It is hard to explain but I have learned so much about myself and the world around me from watching this show brilliantly done from New Zealand.

While it can be cheesy at times, The Tribe has some great lessons for kids of all ages and it is entertaining enough that no matter what the age it can be enjoyable. If you are at all a fan of Lord of the Flies I highly suggest you check this out.",1323993600,5,580,3.7540983606557377
4993963,5,B006JN87DE,"I saw this show for the first time in 2003, even though it came out in 1999.  I reccomend everyone buy this, you will not be disappointed. I bought it in Region 2 and will definitley be buying this when it is released! A girl has to have backups! ;)",1323993600,,249,3.98
4994004,5,B006JN87DE,"I've been looking for the The Tribe box sets for about three years! I was ecstatic to finally find them. I used to watch The Tribe on WAM, but then my parents got a different television provider. That channel wasn't available through them. When they went back to the same provider years later, I'd hoped The Tribe would still be on, but it wasn't. :(
This show is so AMAZING. The DVD quality is fantastic! Probably the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon!!",1355184000,,459,4.476190476190476
4994005,5,B006JN87DE,"First it was the american, and japanese transformers episodes. Then vr troopers,mighty morphin power rangers,and big bad beetleborgs. Now the tribe, man what other of my favorite shows. Are you gonna put on dvd next?  Please let it be the bionic six, mighty orbots, or dinosaucers! Shout factory keep up the good work!",1351555200,,318,5.0
4994006,1,B006JN87DE,"Since the adults are all dead (except for some minor flashbacks) this leaves the whole series populated with kids.  It could have been interesting if it had been written for an adult audience --- but it seems aimed at tweens and teens.

Basically - BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGG.

Not worth buying unless you absolutely have to have it for your collection.",1338422400,,345,4.913793103448276
4994007,5,B006JN87DE,"So, they finally came out on DVD! I randomly searched the Tribe on amazon.com to see if they had anything on region 1 and they finally did, had to wait years for it but it happened.

Only downside of this DVD is that it's in two parts and I can't wait for June 12th. Every time I see an episode I need to watch them all, the show's amazing.",1337385600,,340,3.927536231884058
4994008,3,B006JN87DE,"I am trying my best to get through this series, but I'm finding if extremely difficult. The sad thing is, there's no reason for it to be failing as much as it does.  It's a great premise, the costume and make-up team did a fantastic job, the characters are genuine, and it's pulled off rather well despite the budget.
So why is it difficult to watch you ask?
WORST MUSIC EVER!!
I am constantly amazed at how awful it is.  From the retched theme song all the way down the line, it's this agonizing nightmare of cheesy meandering synth vomit. It's somewhat reminiscent of the score from Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (which I don't actually mind), but the problem here is that it never fits with the scene.  It's like someone took an giant audio crap all over what would have been an otherwise delicious bit of television sweetness, rendering it nearly unwatchable.  This is the first time I've wished for separate audio tracks for dialog, sound fx and music so I could just mute it and get on with enjoying the story.
I don't want to think that all New Zealanders are musically retarded. I'm hoping it's only Simon Lockyer, and that someone will break his fingers, before he attempts to ruin another project.",1335830400,,1204,4.586046511627907
4994009,4,B006JN87DE,"I've loved this show for years and was so happy that it is finally being released in Region 1. I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes post-apocalyptic dramas.
However, I was disappointed that there were no extras at all on this first set.  The menus are extremely plain and only get you to the episode you want to watch. This first half of season 1 includes episodes 1-26. There aren't even any subtitles available for those who either need them or can't watch with the sound up. If this is the extent of the plans for the US releases then I would recommend that fans invest in a cheap all region DVD player(often a code can turn your DVD player all region) and just purchase the R2 copies for their extras etc. You can pick up the Region 2 FULL season sets for less than they are selling this half of the first season anyway.  I am so disappointed that after such a long wait, this is all there is to show for it.",1333152000,6,926,4.255681818181818
4994010,5,B006JN87DE,"The first time I saw this show was on a network called Noggin and I was hooked from day one! Its a mix between Lord of The Flies, Degrassi with a little Apocolypse mixed in! I would reccommend it to anyone! I AM SO SO SO SO happy they finally released it in the US. I already bought this DVD and watched the whole thing in like 3 days! I cannot wait for the next one to come out, and hope they release the series! GO MALLRATS!",1332979200,,426,3.9080459770114944
4994011,5,B006JN87DE,This worth the buy love the show can't wait for the part 2 comes out in June it has 4 Disc in one case.,1332633600,,103,3.3333333333333335
4994012,5,B006JN87DE,"Got my DVD's.. have been watching non stop!

Watching it on my laptop, quality is fair, packaging is really nice and thought out. 4 discs in one normal sized DVD Case. Comes with a little 4 page booklet with episode synopsis. Great packaging overall!

I need the rest of season 1!

This show has its ups and downs. Trudy's character is quite needy and often laughable, I forgot how funny/tough/sensitive/awful Lex can be! Terrific characters, trying to get my 13 yr old niece to watch.

5 stars because its an amazing series. Great characters, great romances, struggles, heartaches, jealousy, joy, growth.",1332374400,,605,4.96039603960396
4994013,5,B006JN87DE,"This is a series about the survival of the children of the world after the adults die of a virus.  It is like a teen soap opera with all the love and sorrow, danger and intrigue.  Thank you for finally bringing this dvd to America.  I had never seen season 1...what a joy!  I already preordered season 1.5.  I can't wait to own the entire collection.",1332115200,,350,4.242424242424242
8499600,5,B006JN87DE,One of the Best shows ever and I am so Happy it is on DVD! I really hope they put all of them on DVD for the US!!!,1482883200,,114,3.107142857142857
8499601,4,B006JN87DE,"I liked this series when I watched on TV years ago and, though it's a bit tacky here and there, enjoyed watching it again on DVD.  I do wish the other season would come out in U.S. format!",1442534400,,188,3.9473684210526314
8499602,5,B006JN87DE,"I have watched this in the past when it was first aired on WAM! back in 2002-2003. It was a show to watch to kill time, didn't think of much about it back than. But the show stuck with me, a couple of years ago I found out that there was going to be a DVD release of the first series here in America. First time it has ever been released in America. I bought it at the local DVD shop and when I started watching it I was hooked all over again. The stories and the characters are believable in this world, though I will say one thing I will say is that some of the action feels a bit staged but since they are teenagers and probably had not much training in terms of action sequences to make it look real I can over look it. But The Tribe is a program that you will enjoy if you want a program that is new and fresh. Like the back of the case says think of this as a mix between Lord of the Flies and Mad Max. This is my number one favorite show of all time.",1415577600,,957,3.814070351758794
8499603,5,B006JN87DE,"Finally a Tribe DVD available for America -now we need the other 4 seasons for U.S. fans. I discovered this New Zealand-U.k. series while in Germany on UKs Channel 5 in re-runs-first season. Was an adult in 20s & now as much older adult still enjoy The Tribe! :)
 Not much available for fans of The Tribe, esp. years after series end...  I'm not very familiar with the two more recent CD Soundtracks, but a NZ friend a few yrs back gifted me with ~the ORIGINAL 2000 ABE MESSIAH CD~ which is a good album with the theme song & a variety of pop songs sung by The Tribes cast members. Unfortunately I now must sell this htf Soundtrack currently on Ebay (as of April.'14).

8499604,5,B006JN87DE,I had been wanting to watch this series from the beginning but could not find one that would play on our DVD.  I didn't want to have to buy an extra DVD for just this series!! Hope they keep transferring the other seasons,1390521600,,221,4.1395348837209305
8499605,5,B006JN87DE,I have been a fan since I saw season 5 on cable. I am excited to find out how they got to there.,1386374400,,96,3.217391304347826

8499607,5,B006JN87DE,Love this series. Wish the other seasons were ready for sale in the US. Pretty bogus I can not order the rest.,1369267200,,110,4.045454545454546

8499609,5,B006JN87DE,"When I saw that they had The Tribe on dvd for region 1 I was, absolutely thrilled.  I watched this show with my kids when we lived in Germany.  I loved it then and I love it now.  I bought the first 2 seasons, and I can't wait until they get the rest of the seasons on dvd for region 1!!",1360368000,,287,3.6721311475409837
