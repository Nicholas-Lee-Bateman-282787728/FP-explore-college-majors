3757437,5,B001PR0YJO,"Great film all the way. Has the feeling of The Godfather in scope and reach. Acting is superb, Music is fantastic, story-captivating and perfectly suited for todays tabloids in America. Great ending and of course the locale and time period makes it impossible to turn away from watching the TV. This movie is in Spanish with English subtitles unavailable. You must understand Spanish to watch. Lets hope Hollywodd doesnt get ahold of this one and ruin it. Tom Cruise as the General-Oh no please!!!!! Tear This Heart Out is a magnificent film.",1308614400,3,542,4.9021739130434785
3757438,4,B001PR0YJO,"Much better than I thought it would be! The acting was pretty good. It might be a little too sexy, but it didn't bother me nor my wife. Amazon is our choice.",1307404800,,157,3.9375
3757439,5,B001PR0YJO,"Angela Mastretta's novel has been brought to the screen in this truly excellent film.  The title comes from a song popular in the 30s or 40s.  In fact, throughout the book and the movie,songs of the period, in recordings by artists who first made them popular, reflect the heroine's growth.  I highly recommend this film and, to those who read Spanish, the novel of the same title.",1280534400,13,381,4.656716417910448
3757440,5,B001PR0YJO,"This is probably the most ambitious and bold Mexican film of the decade. Supported by a well rounded script, deals with the in and outs of a very unconventional girl who learns to make audacious decisions in order to obtain love, security and comfort at the moment to meet an ambitious and ruthless General. But, as the time goes by she is aware she was wrong and that besides he wrongly played the pieces of her emotional universe.

Ana Claudia Talascon dazzles with her naturalness and magnetism. Daniel Gimenez Cacho as the macho man is overwhelming too. Jose Maria Tavira as the young rival makes a convincing performance.

A remarkable gem of the Mexican cinematography.",1271289600,18,675,4.860869565217391

3757443,4,B001PR0YJO,"Mexican director Roberto Sneider wrote the script of ""Tear This Heart Out"" (""Arrncame la Vida"") with the author and winner of the Mazatln Prize for Literature for the best book of the year ngeles Mastretta published in Mexico in 1985 partially inspired by the life of Maximino vila Camacho, a four-star general in Mexico's revolutionary forces, brother of Manuel vila Camacho who was President of Mexico from 1940 to 1946...

The film opens with the beautiful Catalina Guzmn (Ana Claudia Talancn) marrying at her early age a charismatic and cunning general named Andrs Ascencio (Daniel Gimnez Cacho), much older than her... Dazzled by his world, Catalina escorts him on his political campaigns, perceiving at his side the intriguing political systems to obtain social justice...

Catalina, a smart but not an educated young woman, dedicates years of her youth to a 'loving' husband... She comes to Puebla to hear from the voice of her man, the governor of the beautiful city, that soon she will be the First Lady of Mexico as he considers himself the best-qualified candidate to win the race for the Presidency...

But one day, Catalina finds out that her arrogant and prepotent macho man is cheating on her with several women and has several children out of that relationship... But in spite of all that, and observing her husband's pervert and bad manners, Catalina continues to live with Andrs, to bear his two children, to train his others children in her family, to serve him as his adviser and to guide him to win elections, taking intense pleasure from that attitude... Nevertheless she learns that life and power are not always so pink...

There is a scene during her pregnancy, where we saw her detecting that she is totally neglected... So, for the first time we watch her taking pleasure in having a love affair with a teenager who cherished her dearly...

But the movie takes a dramatic turn when Catalina falls really in love with a concertmaster... And it was forbidden for her to fall in love! And she executes her cruel vengeance on Andrs sharing the musician' bed ignoring the predestined course of his future fate...

And here Roberto Sneider's motion picture clearly comes off with three significant national old traditions: the 1930's post-revolutionary Mexico, the very crucial point for the Mexican girl, the ""rite of passage,"" and the traditional macho man...

The film is a love story through which three main characters are important for the viewer: Andrs, the charming officer, the great orator with the voice so thrilling and so impacting... His wife Catalina divulging how meaningless and insincere his promises are... And Carlos (Jose Mara de Tavira), the leader of the orchestra, the future of a new Mexico, the rebel, and what Mexico is expecting from her younger men...

The motion picture presents the concept of the long-suffering Mexican woman vanishing here with Catalina as seen powerful of character, efficacious and extreme in having an affair with the man she deeply falls in love, intense in degree to accept whatever she is asked from her lover to carry out...

Her representation of the submissive wife, in a macho world where women are suppressed and their voices not heard, has fallen with her determined and ambivalent character here, as near Carlos, Catalina is another woman who wishes, requests, and desires intensely the enjoyment of her personal liberty and personal efficacy...

The result is a fine rich movie with many captivating visuals of the stunning state of Puebla, and definitely a must-see, at least for the Mexican viewers...",1234396800,2,3588,5.025252525252525

3757574,3,B001PR0YJO,"Mexico is a country with such a fascinating and wonderful history.  Why then would one of the highest budget movies to come out of Mexico focus on the love life of a general's wife?  The acting is wonderful, the sets are period perfect, even the cinematography is well done.  Still, I can't help but think that a movie about the more generalized issues of the era would have been a better use of all that effort.",1380412800,,412,4.394736842105263

3757579,5,B001PR0YJO,"Very good movie, with a lot of history of how things were in ""those"" days with

families trying to get out of poverty and the rampant corruption in all the the spheres of goverment in Latin American countries.
A little intense in some parts and strong sexual content , not to watch with kids. Very well executed scenes of that era, even ""real"" characters if those times were introduced in the movies, like Toa la Negra singing the movie title song.
Saw the main character , the other day in ""Like Water for Chocolate"" , she is amazing and beautiful , don't know
how Hollywood has not discovered her ! would make a great Tom Cruise or James Bond chic partner. Very interesting movie from an historical point of view. Another must see.",1361404800,,733,4.511278195488722

life behind and become a powerful force in the life of her ambitious political husband.... that is until she encounters a musician closed to her age
who awakens her principles and intimate life... which would carry the ultimate price for one of them.  Worth seeing.",1353715200,,410,4.694444444444445

I chose it for one of my college-level classes and it generated some interesting discussions of a cultural, social and historical nature. Research is needed to connect the characters of the movie to real-life people. Once i connected the movie characters to real historical characters, the discussion about the movie took a whole new life, a much interesting one.",1432512000,,497,5.0
