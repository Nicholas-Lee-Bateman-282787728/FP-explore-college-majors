8337054,1,B001R0AYG2,The video quality is terrible.  It would look better if it had been filmed of a TV screen. Even the Dragnet theme song is missing. The seller should be embarrassed to even sell such a DVD.  This is the worst video transfer I have ever seen.,1506816000,,240,4.195652173913044

8337056,4,B001R0AYG2,"Nice to see these episodes again. If you saw the originals, it's the same.  Quality is good. Audio is fine. Bill Gannon is still Bill Gannon!

Love the episodes where they deal with drug issues. You'd had thought smoking a joint would've caused you to become a delinquent, headed to the chair!  Hahahahahaha!  Man, how times have changed.  Thankfully for the better! Enjoy!!",1464739200,,374,4.873015873015873
8337057,2,B001R0AYG2,This was not what I expected.  I thought it would be @The Dragnet Collection'  but alas no.  just some really old shows and not very good quality.,1461801600,,146,4.333333333333333

8337060,3,B001R0AYG2,"This is called the DRAGNET COLLECTION but also has episodes of other early TV ""crime"" shows, (Racket Squad, etc).  I found 3 Dragnet episodes here that I did not have on any other collection (The Big Casing, The Big Grandma and The Big Oskar), they are good ones.  It comes in two 2-disc collections (that probably were sold separately originally) that are packaged together in a cardboard box.  I had no trouble playing the discs and the sound and picture were about as good as the other collections, good as you can get from old 16mm prints.  There is no real menu and the opening of the DRAGNET episodes do not have the Dragnet theme music (Dum Da Dum Dum) but some inane music...why, is never explained.  They do put the episode title along the bottom of the screen.  All in all this is not bad for the very nice price.",1370217600,4,823,4.417218543046357
8337061,5,B001R0AYG2,"My favorite TV show of childhood was Dragnet, and my idol was Jack Webb/Joe Friday.  Seeing that these are true stories, Dragnet portrays true life of a policman and the citizens they protect.  Most television police dramas are fake and just dramatized to get public viewership and ratings.",1357344000,2,290,5.020833333333333
8337062,5,B001R0AYG2,"I was very pleased with this set, there is another set by the same sutdio, (Pop Flix) called ""The Dragnet Collection Volume 1"" ... This set ""The Dragnet Collection 2009"" also made by Pop Flix is the same, (I mean the same disc and case), with an additional 2 new discs that contain 6 more classic Dragnet Episodes and 14 classic episodes of Racket Squad, Follow That Man, and Federal Men, (total of 14 episodes not 14 each) ... DVD picture quality was EXCELLENT once you realize that these are from the early 1950s and they were NEVER recorded in 1080P High-def Blu-ray ... I often read reviews complaining about the picture quality, and I have learned to write those reviews off, many people have been spoiled by Blu-ray and forget when a television show was made 55+ years ago, ""No-One"" envisioned re-runs, DVDs, etc ... I assure you, for the age of these shows I was VERY PLEASED with the video quality ... The audio quality was very loud and clear and good ... Every thing regarding epsisodes, etc, listed on the Amazon site was 100% correct ... Again, if you enjoy vintage early television shows, this is the Dragnet set to get !",1294790400,10,1134,4.536585365853658
8337063,4,B001R0AYG2,I love it and this dvd allow me to look at times gone by. There only two problems that I found with this dvd. First some of  the episodes are repeats other volumes .Now that not a problem if you don't have any other volumes. Second none of the original commericals where included. I feel that would have been a plus. I will cherish these dvds for a long time and pass them to my children.,1283040000,5,388,4.105263157894737
