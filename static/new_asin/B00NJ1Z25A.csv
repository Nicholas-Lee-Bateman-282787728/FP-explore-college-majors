6657996,5,B00NJ1Z25A,"Charming doesn't begin to cover it. This is the best Holiday film out this year. The music is so great, the story heartfelt.
It's about a young man's life before and after his compulsion to collect Christmas Music kicks in. And the wonderful record stores that feed his habit. The friends that he makes along the way are some of the most interesting people in the music and film industry. And they all show their sweet side.
Who couldn't love a film that includes both Dr. Demento and Run DMC? I plan to play the DVD in the background for all my holiday parties this year ( and probably next year, too).",1418688000,3,603,4.392857142857143

Like another reviewer, I wish there was a soundtrack to go with this movie.

8678522,5,B00NJ1Z25A,"The first scene in Mitchell Kezins Jingle Bell Rocks! documentary is him entering Amoeba Records in Hollywood like Clint Eastwood getting ready for a showdown with a two story record store! Hes got an itch to scratch and its called Christmas Music! If you're familiar with the collective impulse and been to a place like Amoeba, you know this match will be bloody. The first three minutes, you see Kezin digging through rows of spectacular finds and seem to be in over his head.then it gets worse when the PA system announces that there are ten minutes left until the store closes. The agony he suddenly expresses is painful. I ought to know, Ive been caught in between store hours and that collecting scratch within the walls of Amoeba myself.

From here, you might suspect this well be just another record collecting documentary (as there have been a slew of them since the resurgence of record stores and the success of Record Store Day), but Kezin has taken a much broader approach by expanding this collecting subject by mixing in Christmas music history. He then gets personal as he describes his personal encounters with the two holiday recordings that sends him off down that holiday collecting path; The Boy That Santa Forgot and Blue X-mas (To Whom It May Concern).

From there, he waves many linier paths between alternative Christmas music and the people and cultures that collect and make them.and there are many like John Waters, Dr. Demento, Rev. Run from RUN-DMC, jazz veteran Bob Dorough, the now-grown daughter who sings on her fathers now classic X-mas side Santa Claus Is A Black Man, The Free Design, Clarence Back Door Santa Carter and more. As the film goes on, the history and humanity grows deeper and the cast of characters begins to pile up.

However, getting lost on this Christmas island is just part of the fun and education and Im sure if Henry Rollins did his version of Santa Claus Is A Black Man, this probably pop up on the History Channel.

Needless to say, this film has quickly become a holiday tradition with me, it ranks up there with A Charlie Brown Christmas and A Wish For Wings That Work; warm, funny and seasonal.and now, with me, personal as I now got sucked into the much bigger world of X-mas music mix tape trading. I use to put such tapes together to hip my friends and family to the wider world of this alternative holiday stuff for years. Now, thanks to this title, Im forced into a much bigger world of collectors, directly.which now includes Mr. Kezin himself! I love this movie, but, like Kezin felt in the beginning, what the freakin hell did I get myself into!?!?

More bonus points: in one of the DVDs bonus scenes, a collector talks about Lord Buckleys classic holiday retelling of Jesus Of Nazareth called The Nazz. Even BIGGER points: Rev. Runs Everything Is Santa Claus speech at the very end. Preach on, brother!!",1434412800,3,2876,4.698412698412699
