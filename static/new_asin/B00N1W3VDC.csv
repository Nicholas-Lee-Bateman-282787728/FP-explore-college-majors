Maison Close gives us an un-sugarcoated, to the point of cringeworthy, depiction of life within a Parisian brothel, ca. 1871, referred to in the story as Le Paradis. In this existential universe nobodys totally good or bad though our sympathies are generally with ""the gorgeous ladies of The Paradise,"" the Madam, and even her gruff first lieutenant. The many characters and their complex story lines would do a Dostoevsky novel proud, and they are rendered in well-textured shadings.

By contrast there are few bright spots among the boorish clients (mostly rich folks and heavy-handed representatives of officialdom) and the various parasitical, mostly male, hangers-on. On the whole these are a pretty squalid, amoral lot and don't elicit a lot of sympathy from us. Yes, it was a mans world in late Ninetennth Century Paris, but even then the times were a changin, and the various nuances of the changes, i.e. how the women gradually gained the upper hand - at least within the walls of the Paradis - are eminently fascinating to watch. Much of the credit for the series' success must go to the performers who inhabit their roles with an impressive commitment and believability. Special kudos to Valeri Karsenti as the icy cold madam, Hortense, and Anne Charrier as the maison's star performer Vra.

MC isn't history though historical events very much figure into the story line, in particular the recent Franco-Prussian War, and the subsequent rise - and fall - of the Paris Commune, which were very fresh in everyones memory. Circumstances dictated that folks did what they had to do to simply to survive. As a result, bargains were sometimes made with the devil.

The subtitles are much welcome: even if I spoke French, which I dont, it would be difficult to follow the rapidly delivered, conspiratorially low-volume, whispery speech. A minor flaw is the DVDs absence of bonus features. In a story which interconnects so much of history, culture and human experience, such extras scream out for inclusion. But alas, not to be. However, a welcome consolation is the generous collector's booklet.

For all its unsavory subject matter, Maison Close is basically high class soap opera. But when its this compulsively watchable and rendered with this level of high-quality, albeit murky, production values, how can we quibble?",1430006400,3,2382,5.113110539845758

I stumbled across Maison Close as a result of my following the career of Jemima West.

Taking place in Paris immediately following the Franco-Prussian War, the serial is steeped in the mores of the period, and it does well in transporting you into that world. The story is centered around a government-run bordello, or ""maison close,"" named Paradis (while ""le Paradis"" is likely fictitious, the show's characters at times mention a rival brothel, ""le Chabanais,"" which famously existed in Paris). The one exception to the immersive interpretation painted by Maison Close is its penchant for using contemporary music. This aspect may be a deal-breaker for some viewers, yet I am confident that despite being particularly jarring at first, if you give this peculiarity some time you may begin to see it as an inspired juxtaposition.

There is a fair amount of depth to the plot, and if you are paying attention to the subtitles instead of the subtleties, it's easy to miss the facial expressions and mannerisms that help to tell the story, e.g., why characters behave as they do towards one another. At times Maison Close resembles a sophisticated soap opera, yet I hesitate to use the term for a drama that provides a window into the past with such detail. This series could have been so bad, but the quality of the acting, the sets, and sometimes the dialogue ended up with me giving the season 5 stars.

While the adult nature of the premise ensures nudity, the sexual content here isn't more graphic than what is seen in a typical HBO drama. Speaking of HBO, Maison Close is on par with that level of programming (it aired on Canal+, a French premium cable TV channel).

It's distressing to watch how Rose (Jemima West) is forcibly inducted into the bordello; I imagine how this scenario could have happened given the circumstances in 1871, so I don't have any reason to doubt the portrayal by the screenwriters as anything but realistic for the period. While West's character isn't fleshed out (excuse the pun) this season, her role is more emphatic in season 2.

There isn't much room for humor in Maison Close, but they still manage to pull it off tastefully on random occasions. The most memorable example is a visiting Dr Lombardi who pokes and prods our heroines and then informs them of some conclusions from his research; the good doctor gets his just desserts after presenting his biased, half-baked findings.

Overall, this first season of 8 episodes is a forbidding yet addictive show to delve into. Despite murder, mayhem, and the unfortunate exploitation of prostitution, Maison Close doesn't leave you in a pool of misery after indulging in it.",1419984000,14,2990,5.180124223602484
8675756,4,B00N1W3VDC,"A NON-ROMANTICIZED TALE (NOR A MORALISTIC TALE) INVOLVING A BROTHEL -- SURPRISINGLY INTELLIGENT AND EVEN BEAUTIFUL AT TIMES, BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE

This story set in the high end Parisian brothel Le Paradis, catering to the wealthy and governing elite, is a beautifully filmed period drama with a bit of a greyish-blue color scheme that highlights the blue slate roofs, stone alleys and cobblestone streets of 1871 Paris, France. However, it is not a pretty tale. That is not to say it is moralistic. Nor does it romanticize the lifestyle in any way. It simply presents a story in a dramatic yet somewhat realistic way (compared to other brothel tales) and allows the grit to form its own impression on the viewer. It can be gripping if you allow it time and savor the characters. Some just looking for a costume drama may find it a little slow and the subject coarse for their taste. However, let me explain a little more (without spoilers) and make the case for accepting this tale.

THE STORY: Paris 1871 just after the fall of the Second Empire and at the dawn of the Third Republic. France is finding itself morally and politically. Rose is an innocent young woman searching for her mother at Le Paradis brothel in Paris. She is engaged to be married, but has not revealed the whole situation to her fianc&eacute;. Outside Le Paradis one night, she enlists the help of a patron to gain entrance but is tricked into servitude at the brothel. Though she does not find her mother at first, she begins to investigate the mystery of her disappearance while coping with her forced prostitution. Vera is the star of the house, able to make any man (or woman) feel they are special in her arms. She is headed the opposite direction from Rose as she prepares to leave the house, having won the heart of a baron who will give her a wealthy, fairytale life. Hortence Caillac is the Madame of the house with a powerful brother Paul Caillac. Hortence happens to prefer women and has an obsession for the well experienced Vera. Their tempestuous relationship is challenged when Vera's good fortunes come to light. Hortence must find a way to keep Vera there anyway she can, both for love and financial success. As young Rose and Vera bond over personal misfortunes, Vera teaches Rose how to cope, and of the power she can wield over men. They will be a powerful duo before the season is over. There is some sort of dark secret between Hortence and her brother, with many revelations to be exhumed. Some political conflict is also in play between patrons as Paul seeks advancement to the highest levels of social standing and government, despite his connection to a house of ill repute.

This show is fantastic in its character development, production values, period dress, cinematography, and acting. All are really top notch. The greyish hue they filmed the program in was stunning, and causes the other more garish colors of the costumes and brothel to pop. As I mentioned though, this series is a little slow to develop and much of the drama early on just doesn't hit or grab as hard as it probably should. However, in the final episodes things are driven to the edge as Rose begins to discover her own sordid history involving her mother and as conflicts with Paul Caillac must be rectified. Those not up for a plodding drama may not make it to the end. It's kind of a drama about family too (not family oriented) as the girls are each others new family. For others who can sit through the excellent and meticulous story construction, there is ultimately reward. I'm not going to say the show is perfect, though I did appreciate it greatly by the finish. Jemima West as Rose makes both a wonderfully innocent ing&eacute;nue and fiery force of nature later on. She is both dear and dangerous!

CONTENT: For a show set in a brothel, nudity is surprisingly not the focus. There is not that much - all considered. However, there are constant sexual situations and innuendo of a very graphic nature. It is NOT a genteel tale. Human trafficking is not romanticized in this program though there are elements as one might expect for a brothel tale. Take this description and decide for yourself if it's for you. It is an outstanding drama overall.",1417219200,3,4233,4.677852348993288
