3787705,4,B001T21R5A,Have always enjoyed Kurt russell.  He has only gotten better since the Disney days.  Two very suspenseful action packed movies.,1402617600,,127,5.3
3787706,4,B001T21R5A,"Kurt Russel portrays  an overly concerned husband in ""Unlawfull Entry"" and rightfully so.  The movie keeps one suspended from scene to scene.  However, it becomes predictable towards the end of the movie.  But this is still a good movie with a good solid plot and very good acting. ""Executive Decision"" is another good movie, one of which I suspect they purposely got rid of Steven Segal's character due to internal filming issues.",1378080000,,431,4.944444444444445

3787711,3,B001T21R5A,"This release gives us two Kurt Russell dramas,Executive Decision(released Mar/96) and Unlawful Entry(June/92).Both are pretty much middle of the road films for Russell,with some good action and suspense but nothing out of the ordinary.
Executive Decision has Russell as an important decision maker,high up in the Government ranks. A mission that tries to obtain a deadly gas agent from the Chechen mafia(?)fails. Fast forward and the man responsible for having the agent in his possession in the first place,has been captured,but his second in command is not a happy camper. He is going to use his leaders capture to send a strong message to the U.S.He loads a plane with high explosives and the deadly gas agent and hi-jacks it,with the intent of blowing it up over Washington,D.C.
Russell is assigned to help a select group of commandos take the plane back. They come up with a plan to fly the men in a stealth jet,attach it to the underbelly of the 747 airliner,transfer the men from one plane to another,defuse the bomb and rescue the plane and its passengers. And not necessarily in that order. During the transfer mid air,turbulence forces the stealth jet to have to tear itself away from the airliner,which results in the death of the commando commander. Only half the expected force gets on board the airliner,including Russell,and these few people have to devise a way of meeting their objectives.
In the meantime the airliner is getting closer and closer to U.S.airspace,which officials refuse to let the plane get through. Through a rag tag series of events the team eventually obtains their objective,but not without casualties to the passengers and crew. In fact Russell is left trying to fly and land the plane o solo mio. Having,coincidentally,been learning to fly himself,he has to recall every lesson he has ever had to land the plane at all. After landing a 747,what else is left? Oh yeah,the pretty flight stewardess. Russell,you old dog you!
The film is pretty formulaic,though it does have a rather good cast,with the likes of Halle Berry,Steven Seagal,David Suchet,John Leguizamo,and taking a break from his Babylon 5 duties,Andrea Katsulas. The good cast can't get past the plot however,but nice try. 3 stars.
Unlawful Entry has Russell as a design consultant,living in a nice home with his pretty wife Madeline Stowe. One night there is a break in and his wife is temporarily grabbed and held at knife point by a burglar. He eventually flees,leaving her unharmed. One of the two cops that respond to the call is Ray Liotta,who takes a fancy to the pretty Madeline. The cops advise the pair to get an alarm system installed and that the department would be sending folks around to dust for fingerprints. Well,nothing gets done until they put a call into Liotta ,who within a short time has not only the finger print crew out,but an alarm company. The Russells invite Liotta for supper and get to know him better. Everything seems fine for a bit,but when a deal that Russell has cooking is going south,thanks to Liotta's unwanted interference,Russell puts his foot down and asks that Liotta never come around.
Things immediately start to happen,such as Russell trying to pay a supper tab only to discover his credit card is over drawn. Then upon leaving his car has been clamped and gets towed. At the impound it seems the police suddenly discover over $600 in unpaid fines!? Russell not only files a complaint against Liotta,but he talks directly to his work partner who agrees to help him. While jogging the next day,Liotta's partner says that he has to get his obsession of Russell and especially his wife,out of his head;or he is going""upstairs"" to higher authorities. While out the next day they spot a local punk making a drug transaction. They follow him to his apartment and force their way in to arrest them. This gives Liotta the opportunity to kill his partner and then the punk,to make it look as if the punk shot his partner.
From here it just gets worse as the police make a sudden raid and find a substantial amount of cocaine in the Russell's home,and he is arrested. While Russell sits anxiously awaiting his attorney to get him bail,Liotta is moving on his wife at home. He kills her friend who has come over to look after her and takes her place. When she comes down to see her friend, of course Liotta is there and he makes his intention towards her pretty clear. He spills it all and it is obvious Liotta is a cop who has lost all of his sense of reality and is extremely dangerous. Before Liotta has his way with Russells wife,Russell has in the meantime been sprung from jail and has arrived home. It is a tense situation and a struggle leaves Liotta bleeding near the front door. As Russell stands in the doorway talking to his wife Liotta suddenly stands up behind him. As Russell points Liotta's own weapon at him,Liotta says ""You aren't going to shoot me..."".Russell empties the gun and the two sit on the porch as the police arrive.
This is another contrived plot which has some suspenseful moments,I must admit. Liotta's portrayal of the deranged cop is quite creepy and you can almost see the scum dripping off of him. Russell plays well the every-man reactions one would expect from a person in his shoes. Overall though,just not enough for this reviewer to get his bungee in a twist for. 3 stars.
Both films are in their original w/s a/r's,E.D.in 2:40:1,and U.E. in 1:85:1. Both are clear and crisp but Unlawful Entry is grainier than the other and I suspect could use a better remastering. The is a single double sided disc,so be careful of scratches and marring.
Over all a fair to middling couple of films by Kurt Russell,nothing to write home about,but enough to keep one entertained on a stormy night,with a fresh bowl of popcorn and an open bottle of Baby Duck. Doesn't take much to please me. Recommended.",1344643200,,5866,4.780295566502463

EXECUTIVE DECISION
In light of 9/11 and current Mideast events, this story of Islamic terrorists who hijack a jet loaded with deadly toxins seems all the more plausible. Seagal's greezy n' eezy hero soldier doesn't last the first half-hour (yay!). In his MIT yearbook, Platt's straw-chomping computer whiz is the ""nerd least likely to save the day."" Granite-jawed Russell's small plane flying lesson at film's start foreshadows this one's spectacular finale. Not the greatest actioner, but far from the worst.

UNLAWFUL ENTRY
A cop who installs a security system after a break-in at Michael Carr's home seems to be dropping by too often and spending a lot of time with Mrs. Carr. Their conversations aren't always about the alarm system either, so Michael naturally begins to wonder what's going on. Liotta plays his patented ""normal guy goes wacky"" nutcase. Russell, who's so good in paranoia-tinged thrillers (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BREAKDOWN/dp/6305182086/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BREAKDOWN</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TANGO-CASH/dp/B002GHHHIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TANGO & CASH</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BACKDRAFT/dp/0783223609/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BACKDRAFT</a>), can't keep up with Liotta once he gets started.

8340297,5,B001T21R5A,"I bought this on a whim hoping it was the original US version of Executive Decision. It is. Classic 90s action movie (starring none other than the President's ex-wife as a flight attendant). I recently saw it again on HBO and was surprised when I noticed some of the dialogue had been changed/poorly dubbed over and some scenes cut. Did a little research and turns out it was for PC reasons. Regardless, the original is now hard to find as the Blu-Ray and I believe newer DVD prints contain the edited version. This contains the original version you saw back in the 90s.",1502496000,,570,4.543689320388349

8340301,5,B001T21R5A,"What can you say about Kurt Russell?  Hard to believe this man, as young as he is, is such a professional - so talented, yet in such a way that you'd think he doesn't even work hard at all, it's just a gift...just the way he is.  I don't care for some hard-hitting dramas, but these movies by Mr. Russell are done so well, you are drawn in very quickly much like a friend listening to a best bud relaying details of a hard-to-believe story.  So well done...but then I like Kurt Russell and especially movies with his lovely wife, Goldie Hawn...are they going to every do more.  They have great on-screen chemistry.",1451174400,,614,4.407079646017699
