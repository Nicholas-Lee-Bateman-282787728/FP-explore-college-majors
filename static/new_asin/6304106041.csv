778657,2,6304106041,"It was ""The Italian Job"" all over again. A movie that presents itself as a real crime movie, with a promising cast and enthralling title, but winds up giving you nothing but a pile of the oldest family movie cliches.

This movie *is* worth watching for it's supporting cast. Fans of Christopher Walken, Christopher Lloyd, or Steve Buscemi should check it out. (Especially female Steve Buscemi fans. Oh my, that Mr. Shush...he can kill me any time he wants!) The secondary female lead, Lucinda, is also a unique and lovable character.

But the rest if the film is an insulting pile of sappy cliches, and that includes the male and female lead. Bland sexy heroine; bland male hero with shinny bangs and puppy eyes; friend in combat who has a wife and kids at home and is totally not gonna die tragically; random old guy and black best friend, dispensing groundbreaking words if wisdom like, ""life can pass you by...""

Oh, and then there's the very original plot. As others have noticed, it's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" but with a few differences in the storytelling style. ""Denver"" takes Tarantino's plot, and trades the vicious, anti-hero gangsters for soft, Disney style ""anti heroes;"" trades the oldies soundtrack and powerful silences for cheesy ""heartwarming"" background music; the quirky, flawed, lead characters for generic cliches; and the realistic, tragic ending for a happy disney ending.

What's really angering me here I'd the title of the movie. It's so COOL, it's a title for a REAL crime movie like ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and it was just wasted on a Lifetime movie.

Basically...this movie sucks, and it's only saving grace is the great supporting cast.",1419033600,,1653,4.953068592057762

778723,4,6304106041,"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (Gary Fleder, 1995)
[originally posted 13Jul2000]

Why in the world did this twisted, sick little gem of a film never get the attention it deserves? With a cast list with the kind of power this one has (to give you an idea, Christopher Walken's name is tenth in the credits...), a fast-moving plot, typically wisecracking bad guys, Steve Buscemi in the role he always does so well (quiet, sociopathic Evil Guy<TM>), and a can't-miss plot (bad guys screw up shakedown), how can you go wrong? Obviously, in promotion and distribution, because Fleder's first cinematic offering (he's done a lot of work as a TV guy) is missing nothing.

The Man with the Plan (Christopher Walken) is a bad, bad man. An assassination attempt has left his wife (Aelina Matthews) dead and him paralyzed from the neck down. His son Bernard (veteran TV heavy Michael Nicolosi) has slipped far over the edge into insanity, and in the movie's very first scene we see him being arrested for attempting to snatch a child from a playground. Walken has a theory: his kid's descent into madness started when his high-school and college sweetheart Meg (Sarah Trigger) broke up with him. Meg's current beau, the guy she left Bernard for, is headed into Denver to do the propose-to-Meg's-parents thing, and Walken wants him shaken down so he won't marry Meg. He hires an ex-associate of his gone straight, Jimmy ""the Saint"" Tosnia (Andy Garcia), to do the job. Jimmy gets the old gang back together for the shakedownFranchise (William Forsythe), Pieces (Christopher Lloyd), Easy Wind (Bill Nunn), and Critical Bill (Treat Williams). Of course, everything goes wrong, and there the fun begins. Oh, yeah, and while Jimmy is attempting to play both sides of the fence, he's also attempting to woo another guy's girlfriend (Gabrielle Anwar) while fending off the crush of a teen prostitute (Fairuza Balk).

It's fast, it's furious, it's funny, it's foul, it's a Quentin Tarantino movie without Quentin Tarantino, and it deserves more attention than it got. Go see it. Now. *** ",1382140800,,2078,4.928571428571429
778724,5,6304106041,I would recommend this to anyone who loves crime drama. It's a bit sad but that particular tone is necessary to tell the story as it must be told. Steve Buscemi fans rejoice. Steve plays a contract killer and this is one of his earliest films. 5/5,1381708800,,247,4.276595744680851

778767,5,6304106041,Ok so I have to admit that I love off-beat movies like this.  The acting was not the best that any of these actors have done but it is quite good.  I still remember when this movie premiered and how it changed language for a while.  The saddest thing about watching this is realizing how much the skyline has changed in Denver - seems like the Bluebird is the only thing still there.,1377216000,,383,4.219178082191781
778768,2,6304106041,"I'm not a hater and I'm always rooting for Andy Garcia! When Andy Garcia came upon the movie acting scene, I really thought that, by the end of his acting career, that he was going to be up in the same class as the greats before him: like Pacino and De niro!

But, not if Andy Garcia keeps being involved with mediocre movies like this 'THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD' debacle!

The title of this movie and the all-star cast is very cool but that's just about where it all ends....

The story of 'a mob boss who asks his beloved lieutenant to do one last job for him and all debts/scores are settled and he, the mob lieutenant, then screws it all up and is marked for death' is a story that's been done in Hollywood over and over again. Sadly, it's not done entertainingly here.

First, the lame script and the dialogue just really sinks this movie. There's no memorable or quotable funny lines! There's no hauntingly unforgettable action scenes or sequences! There's no real on-screen chemistry for most of the actors involved! Plus, the dark camera work and the gopher hole-like lighting in most of the movie is just way too dark for the average pair of human movie-going eyes to see. Also, Andy Garcia's crew in the movie are not even interesting enough, nor likeable, nor even charismatic enough for you to even truly care about if they should die or not! Seriously, though?...Frankly,the premise and the plot of this unoriginal film; in and of itself; just makes no sense...

If I'm marked for death and I got a 48 hours head start, I wouldn't be walking around Denver like Andy Garcia's character(Jimmy The Saint) was doing; wasting time and precious energy trying to plead and save his crew who're already marked for death as well. It's sappy, unrealistic, boring, and not enough to hold my attention span.

No! Man, I'd be hauling major dust clouds out of the city of rocky Denver as fast as I could and I'd be desperately  trying to lose myself in the shadows of a small town or on a mountain top, or jumping onto a fast boat to another country way on the other side of the world where the mob boss couldn't never ever reach me! Shoot!..Come on, now! I'd be building an ice castle behind a polar bear and shooting at every snowflake and little penguin that moves, hoping that it's not the mob boss from America that's still trying to do me in.

As the title of the movie implies, this movie would have been way better if it shifted the plot onto Andy Garcia ACTUALLY trying to fanatically escape Denver but yet more bad guys, the police, old girlfriends,a rival hit-man just released from jail with a score to settle, illegal bounty hunters with trained police dogs, massive traffic jams, freeway/highway closures, and a terrorist attack at the local airport all PREVENT him from leaving Denver!..With only two guns and 25 bullets and wounded from previous fire-fights, I'd have love to have seen Andy Garcia try to make the most out of the few minutes that's left of his 48 hours head start as the mob boss closes in!

Now, THAT was the movie that I was banking on seeing! Yet, unfortunately, none of that cool stuff ever happens here.

I say: Get a jump rope and just skip this movie! This one has ""rainy night"" DVD rental store all over it! ..Save your money!

This movie gets 2 stars only because of Andy Garcia.",1375660800,,3334,4.512437810945274

778773,4,6304106041,"Honestly, this movie is bit of star casting masterpiece.  Treat Williams and Christopher Walken alone are Oscar worthy nods for their performances in this indy jewel.  Well...ok.  Maybe that is a stretch but TTDIDWYD is black comedy genius and one of Andy Garcia's best roles to date in my opinion.  The story is simple yet woven nicely to tell a story of mortality and what a bitch it really is when it's nipping at your heels.  It never pays to go against your instincts or deal with a crime boss that has all the cards for easy money.  There is some geniune saddness here and bittersweet romance interplayed with a thriller withlittle in a way of a happy ending.  But life is usually not always about happy endings anyway.

The pluses: very stylishly shot, beautifully lit, some sharp lines and funny moments, and fine performances from Walken, Williams, Warden and Lloyd.

The minuses: a script that's often painfully wanna-be-hip is the main problem. Writer Rosenberg claims in the brief doc on the dvd that he ""created a whole new language"" for this movie. Now that's a solid ego! What he really did was try to copy a host of other crime thrillers, to some success, while adding some weak attempts at new catchphrases like ""put a name on it"". Sorry bud, Hammett or Chandler or Cain you ain't. Unfortunately, Garcia is the weakest actor here...quite unfortunate indeed, as he's almost always on screen. His dialogue is too self-conscious, as with many of the characters here. Only the good actors can overcome that liability and give this movie the style it tries so hard to have, but there are enough of them to make this worth seeing, and old pro Jack Warden provides the real highlights along with Walken.

By the end it all felt predictable and even a little pointless, but it starts well enough to make one watch the rest. It drags towards the end, and could be 20 minutes shorter with no real loss. The basic plot is kind of weak and unbelievable, and the romance rather ridiculous, but Fleder's direction is so solid and the film so colorfully noirish that one can let the minuses slide and just enjoy the pluses.",1270944000,,1409,4.696356275303644

778891,5,6304106041,"""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" is just one more movie that never got alot of press, publicity or made alot of ""must see"" lists, but its almost perfect!

A friend recently mentioned this movie to me and it happened to be one that slipped past me all these years. Finally I tracked it down at the local video store and expected a funny, action caper movie. Wow, I was wrong, this movie is the real deal.

A great cast including Andy Garcia, Christopher Walken, Christopher Lloyd, William Forsythe, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi. As other reviewers have mentioned, this movie has a very Quentin Tarantino  like feel to it!

Jimmy the Saint (Andy Garcia) is given one last job by The Man with the Plan (Christopher Walken). That job is make sure his son's ex-girlfriends new boyfriend doesn't come around anymore. This isn't a hit, its a scare job. Jimmy the Saint has to assemble his team, which includes Pieces (Christopher Lloyd) named accordingly because he literally has pieces of himself falling off, Franchise (William Forsythe), Easy Wind (Bill Nunn) and Critical Bill (Treat Williams) who is named simply for the fact that everyone who has ever messed with him is in critical condition. What should be an easy job, turns into their worst nightmare when Critical Bill flips out during the job and kills the boyfriend. The Man with the Plan (Walken) calls in the best hitman, Mister Shhh (Steve Buscemi) to kill everyone, with a small hitch, everyone is to be killed ""buckwheats"" style. Buckwheats is the worst kind of hit, a gruesome embarassing death. With Jimmy the Saint's posse on the run, the action is fierce, the violence is high and the laughs are plentiful.

Treat Williams&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everwood-Season-1/dp/B0002DB0FO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everwood - Season 1</a>&nbsp;is outstanding as Critical Bill, the movie is worth watching for his performance alone!

Also starring in this movie, with small roles, Don Cheadle as Rooster, Fairuza Balk as Lucinda and Jenny McCarthy as (Walken's) Nurse.

This is one movie that you definitely wouldn't want to judge by its (boring) cover, ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" is the real deal. Unfortunately this movie is currently out of print at Amazon, but you should be able to find it at your local video store or on the internet.

778971,4,6304106041,"In spite of some flashy, occasionally overused language (e.g., ""give it a name"" meaning tell it like it is), this is a better than average crime film that manages to simultaneously make some fun of crime films. For example, the ""mob boss"" is called, I kid you not, The Man with the Plan. One character's monicker is, another real thing not made up (i.e., I myself am not making this up), Critical Bill. And like that.

So what we got here is a somewhat formulaic plot. OK, more than somewhat. The crime, the, you know, doesn't go as planned kinda thing, the repercussions, etc. But you also have something very unexpected and that is a romance that's not stupid or schlocky, but that actually makes you feel something. The main character, played by Andy Garcia--Jimmy the Saint--falls hard for the lead female (Gabrielle Anwar, she of ""Scent of a Woman"" fame) and the ensuing romance is truly heartfelt. Hmmmm.. a different spin on a crime film. Yes it is.

Even though the characters are kinda stock ones, it's still fun to watch them go through their paces 'cause they're good at it--Christopher Lloyd, Treat Williams (anybody ever figure out how he got that first name?), Christopher Walken, Jack Warden, William Forsythe, and to top it off, the great Steve Buscemi as contract killer (get this) ""Mr. Shush"". (Now that's what I call giving it a name).

So the quirkiness, the pure romance, and the acting chops all save this from being another completely humdrum entry in the post-Tarantino crime film glut. Much better than you might think...",1159747200,7,1546,4.782771535580524

You would think this film might be good, just due to the eclectic list of actors (Jack Warden!  Christopher Walken!  Treat Williams!  That guy from ""Hudsucker Proxy""!).  But you would be so, so wrong.

""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" badly wants to be ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction.""  Indeed, you can compare this movie to ""Reservoir Dogs"" on a macro level, like the screenwriter obviously did.  Getting some criminals together at some dive restaurant and assembling a gang for a job?  Check.  Job goes wrong in the middle of the movie?  Check.  Crazy guy on the crew?  Check.  The team has to deal with the consequences of their failure?  Check.  Hey, all that the writer forgot to check off on his list was interesting dialogue, plot, and some sense of style.  The screenplay lies there like some dude that got whacked, and completely wastes the talent of the cast.  The dialogue and pacing are atrocious, but who needs pacing when you never get anywhere plotwise?

For a movie that references the city of Denver in the title, this movie has less of a sense of place than a TV sitcom.  You never get the feeling you're in Denver, or anywhere in particular for that matter.  Even the expensive yet pointless crane shot in the very first scene (a warning sign from frame 1 of this garbage) doesn't provide any kind of ""Denverness"" to this movie.

This is by far the worst of the Tarantino clones of the 90s.  Truly awful in every way, it is a film to be avoided at all costs.  If you're in the video store on Friday night and this is all that's left, it's a sign that you should turn off the TV that night and go to the pub instead.",1146528000,7,1788,4.447530864197531
778973,4,6304106041,"I often wonder if director's purposely set out to cast as many eccentrics as possible. We've seen it when Abel Ferrara cast Willem Dafoe and Chris Walken in New Rose Hotel, combining seemingly two of the most bizarre actors in Hollywood. And don't forget At Close Range, which combined Crispin Glover and Walken. Also, Steve Buscemi and Walken were together in Pulp Fiction. Are you noticing a common element? That's right: Walken.

He's here in a bit, but pivotal, role as a mob boss who employs  reformed former associate Jimmy ""The Saint""(Garcia), nicknamed The Saint due to his former aspirations to be a priest, to do a simple ""action."" Well, Jimmy and his crew screw up BIG TIME and the crime boss, known on the streets as the ""man with the plan"", tells Jimmy to leave town or else.....

Jimmy has a moral conflict due to the fact that ""the man with the plan"" resfuses to offer Jimmy's crew the same mercies. Things gradually digress, with Jimmy's crew finding themselves the victims of a progression of assassinations at the hands of one Steve Buscemi, known here as Mr. Shhh.

A very good film with many name-brand actors. Andy Garcia does a phenomenal job here, a job that is the best I've seen from him - ever. Here's a list of actors from this film that you'll either know by name of by face.

Andy Garcia

Christopher Walken

Don Cheadle

Steve Buscemi

Jenny McCarthy

Christopher Lloyd - yep, Doc Brown himself

Gabrielle Anwar - best known as Chris O'Donnel's fling in Scent of A Woman

Jack Warden - Big Al from Problem Child

Treat Williams - Bill Pulman lookalike

Fairuza Balk - Vicky Valencourt from The Water Boy

William Forsythe - Flatop from Dick Tracy, also plays cops a lot, as he did in The Devil's Rejects.

Between Balk, Buscemi, Walken, Forsythe, and Lloyd, Gary Fleder has grouped a collection of some of the most bizarre character actors in Hollywood. The affect is fun, though, as you see many faces and names amid this tremendous screenplay and plot.

This is one of the more underrated films I've ever seen. The only problem with this film is that is came out in 1995, not a good year for a film to try to shine with films like Heat, Leaving Las Vegas, Casino, Seven,and The Usual Suspects gaining much attention in terms of the crime/city genre.",1125705600,18,2281,4.620347394540943

While most movie studios go to great lengths to hype up their mobster movies (e.g. scarface and goodfellas), ""Things to Do..."" has mainly gained popularity by word-of-mouth.

The story tells of a reformed gangster, Jimmy the Saint (Andy Garcia) who is forced by the boss (Christopher Walken) to return to the life for a one-time operation.  Afterwards, Jimmy is forced to deal with the consequences.

Andy Garcia and Christopher Walken deliver terrific performances.  Walken's erratic line delivery and Garcia's suave play out perfectly with their respective characters.

779028,4,6304106041,"Scott Rosenberg's script for ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" skates the edge big time in this 1995 film.  There are times when what comes out of the mouth of his characters is on a par with Elmore Leonard and Quentin Tarrantino, but there are also moments when the verbiage becomes so dense that the film loses momentum.  But whether you think that Rosenberg comes out ahead in the end or falls short, I can guarantee you that you will never forget what it means to ""Buckwheat"" somebody and that ""Boat drinks"" will sound like a great idea until the day you die.

The situation in ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" is that Jimmy the Saint (Andy Garcia) and his buddies know there time is coming to an end any moment.  Jimmy runs a business where dying people get to videotape words of wisdom from beyond the grave to their loved ones.  Throughout the film we get to see clips from such tapes, and if you do not know who is going to appear on the last one then you are not really thinking ahead on this one.  This might be a good idea but it is a lousy business and Jimmy has been losing money and what he owes is now due to the Man With the Plan (Christopher Walken), a psychotic paraplegic who knows exactly how Jimmy can work out his debt.

A widower, the Man's son has been arrested for trying to molest a young girl on a school playground in broad daylight.  The Man thinks that the son will get himself right again if only he can get back together with his old girlfriend, but she has a new boyfriend.  Jimmy is order to pick up the boyfriend when he comes back to Denver and ""brace"" him.  So Jimmy rounds up the old gang to do the deed and makes the mistake of picking Pieces (Christopher Lloyd), a projectionist at a porno theater who has lost a couple of digits to leprosy, and Critical Bill (Treat Williams), a psycho who has not beaten up a live person in years because he blows off steam by pummeling corpses, out front.

Suffice it to say that things go wrong, horribly wrong ((if you see parallels between this film and ""Reservoir Dogs"" I should point out that director Gary Fleder made a point of telling people that Rosenberg's script was written long before Tarrantino's film was made).  This is why Jimmy and the boys are dead because the Man is going to have them killed.  And not just killed.  The famous hit man Mister Shhh (Steve Buscemi) is coming to town to not only kill the boys, but ""Buckwheat"" them (short version: lots of pain and suffering before death).  Fortunately, we do not get to see too much of the actual Buckwheating, but the idea of it is enough to make you start cringing every time another one of the gang goes down for the long count.

Beyond the obvious complication that Jimmy feels bad about causing the imminent deaths of his friends, which he tries to do something about without success, he has a couple of romantic entanglements.  Jimmy has just fallen for Dagney (Gabrielle Anwar), making sure there was as little time between their first and second date (because there is no kissing on the first date), and he knows that the Man knows about her.  But Jimmy also has a soft spoke for Lucinda (Fairuza Balk), who might be a hooker but he does not like it when johns take advantage of her, especially now that she is pregnant.

We have no reason to believe that Jimmy can get out of Denver let along the end of this movie alive.  The rules of the game are too clearly established here, and there is a retired gangster at the local diner (Jack Warden) who helps to fill in the gaps.  The question is whether Jimmy can put together some sort of moral victory before the lights go out, and while there are certainly moments when this film is too damn cute for its own good, I appreciate it when a character listens to me screaming at him what he has to do to payback the Man before the end and actually does it.

It took me a while to get around to this one, but it is nice to see that Rosenberg has shown surer footing nearing the edge in the scripts he has written since then for ""Con Air"" and ""High Fidelity.""  Fleder has gone on to direct ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Runaway Jury,"" both of which are improvements on this effort as well.  ""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead"" is not a first level example of the modern film noir, but it aspires to be and it has some moments.  Plus, you have Christopher Walken showing how menacing he can be when nothing works below the neck, which is certainly good for something as well.",1096329600,30,4486,4.330943847072879

The most fervent work is turned in by Treat Williams, as psychotic Critical Bill, and the major cool, Walken as the wheelchair bound, Man With The Plan (Jenny McCarthy as his nurse).

The only thing going for this flick is the fact that somehow the director/writer has each of these 10 characters legitimately vying for the honor of biggest d-bag to ever grace the screen. That takes some kind of talent at least. If any of these jerks hung out with a mutual friend, you would avoid your friend like the plague. And what's up with these catch phrases? They're obviously meant to be cool, but it would be cooler listening to a group of nerds talk amongst themselves at a pocket protector seminar. ""Give it a name?"" I can think of quite a few names to give it. And let's talk about the plot. Why's a well-off entrepreneur ex-mobster tough guy need to assemble a 'crew' to threaten a stoner? Can't a mob boss find someone a little more competent? My god, it's so asinine it's cracking me up right now.
If you have any taste, do not believe the close-to-5-star rating.

Yes, there is probably a good reason for that (any number of movies like this came out in the year following ""Pulp Fiction"").  No, this movie is not a waste of your time.  Yes, within a few minutes you will have a PERFECTLY clear understanding of the term ""wanna-be"".  And NO, I do not plan on spending the rest of this review writing like this.
An impressive gathering of character actors like this can mean only one thing:  ""Indie Cred"" (or the desperate attempt to obtain it).  And making a ""stylish gangster movie"" is probably the most obvious way to get there.  Create some unusual (even disturbing) characters, write some slick dialogue, and add an air of inevitable doom to the atmosphere and you've pretty much captured the elements that made Quentin Tarantino a fortune and has enabled him to squander the talent that he has for the last 10 years.
In this narrative tale (not entirely convincingly told by Jack Warden) we find the typical ""trying-to-go-straight"" but struggling career criminal (Andy Garcia) being enticed back to work for his former mob boss (Christopher Walken in the first of two memorable roles spent confined to a chair -see ""Suicide Kings"").  It's a simple job; ""encourage"" the boyfriend of the boss's son's ex-girlfriend to leave her, hoping that she'll give the boss's son (who is borderline psychotic, by the way) another chance.  Garcia hooks up again with the assortment of characters who make up his former gang and everything goes wrong bigtime.  Mob boss Walken is not amused, orders everyone killed, and the movie progresses from there.
It's a lot like ""2 Days in the Valley"", actually...except it's in Denver.  And Denver, I have to say, never having been there in person, looks like a charming city.
The real reason to see this movie is to watch The Greatest Pick-Up Line Ever.  Andy Garcia delivers it when he meets the hopelessy sexy Gabrielle Anwar, and even though you KNOW it's an obvious line, he pulls it off amazingly well.  Definitely worth seeing.  Worth owning if you dig the genre.  And definitely worth owning if you're a Christopher Walken fan.",1079481600,15,2153,4.8283378746594

I am hard pressed to recall how I originally heard about it, newspaper review possibly, but based on that alone I knew I had to catch this limited release screening. I do recall when this movie initially released it seemed as if it was already relegated to ""cult"" status because it opened with very little fanfare, in very limited locations,  and only for a short viewing period. My wife and I saw it before we were married at a lesser known theater in Hollywood, not on the strip, where it was only playing for the weekend.  As we walked out when it was over we were so blasted by what we had just seen we carefully scanned the street for suspicious looking cars that might contain tommy-gun weilding hitmen and then ran to our car!

Andy Garcia does a good job of giving this movie an emotional and moral core, as the man straddling the line between good and evil, his past and his future all at once. Treat Williams gives an astounding performance as a complete loon. All in all everyone does well here. One must question the wisdom of Garcia's character allowing the oldest and the most unstable of the crew to perform the most demanding part of their seemingly simple task. Garcia himself and Winn would have been much better in that instance.

779117,5,6304106041,"For those of you who haven't seen this thing, go out and get it. One of the most underrated crime flicks of the last twenty years, it has Andy Garcia as Jimmy The Saint, a former crook who abandons his vocation in favour of the more leisurely business of filming the departing wit and wisdoms of the terminally ill. Life is calm and profitable until Christopher Walken, a wheelchair- bound mob boss calls in an old favour. His son, a... paedophile, has assaulted a young girl and Walken, convinced that the root of the problem is the departure of his son's girlfriend to the arms of another insists the new boyfriend be given a scare. Garcia is reluctantly forced to reassemble the old gang, a now fifty-ish crew of misfits, bums and losers who drift through American lowlife in various guises, the most monstrously entertaining of whom is Treat William's 'Critical Bill' a corpse-punching psychopath whose antics on the night turn the 'scare' into a homicide and whose reaction to Garcia's incredulous wrath is ""Well, it was sort of your fault, Jimmy. You trusted me."" Walken's response to the unmitigated disaster is to declare 'Buckwheats' on all of them, an instruction that they are each to die in the most painful way possible. ...BR>If this sounds too off-the-wall, let me tell you that it works superbly, partly because of first rate acting by Garcia, Williams and Christopher LLoyd as well as a great script, but mainly due to the criminal argot and patois which at times achieves almost poetic levels and makes anything by Tarantino seem amateurish and contrived.

779121,5,6304106041,"Jimmy ""The Saint"" played by the handsome and talented Andy Garcia, is a former mob associate gone almost straight.  That is, until he owes former boss Christopher Walken, now a cripple in a wheelchair, one last favor.

Walken has a son Bernard, who has become a pedophile.  After attacking a little girl who reminds him of his  ex-girlfriend Meg, Walken decides that the only cure for his sons derangement, is to get Meg back.  Since Meg left Bernard for a dental student, Walken recruits Jimmy to ""scare"" the new boyfriend into leaving, thus giving Bernard a second chance with Meg.  After Jimmy agrees to do it, not having a choice, he recruits four old pals to assist him.  Unfortunately for Jimmy, their incompetence, stupidity, and insanity irrevocably wrecks the plan and puts all five men on Walkens ""Hit Parade"".

This is a very unusual story, and wonderfully entertaining as well.  Andy Garcia as Jimmy, is a sympathetic character.  You feel his warmth and caring.  His romance with young Dagney (Gabrielle Anwar) is at once wholesome and sexy.  I particularly liked how Jimmy puts into words, the feeling a woman has for a man who excites her.  ""Does he make you THUMP?""  Jimmy asks after Dagney says she's otherwise involved when first meeting Jimmy.  After winning her over, Jimmy has to ""give her back to the others"" because he knows the end is near.

Fairuza Balk has a meaty, but peripheral role as a prostitute who Jimmy takes a fatherly interest in.  In the end, she immortalizes Jimmy with a love child.

While the film is very well done, I can't understand why Jimmy picks four completely incompetent ex-cons to ""Aid"" his operation for Walken.  The request seems simple enough, but is executed, literally, by inept and insane buddies of Jimmy, instead of Jimmy doing the job by  himself.  Treat Williams turns in a sick, yet hilarious performance as ""Critical Bill"", he always leaves his opponents in that condition, hence the nickname.  He lives among corpses, and uses them for punching bags.  ""He don't mind much..."" he tells Jimmy who witnesses his ""stiff"" workout schedule.  It's hard to believe that anyone would entrust someone like this to be of help, not to mention the rest of the crew, Christopher Lloyd, a leper porn house manager, and William Forsythe, a trailer park biker.  It is certainly proved herein, if you want a job done right, do it yourself.  I suppose if Jimmy did that, the plot wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining.

Like in the movie ""Suicide Kings"", Christopher Walken is quite effective confined to a chair, only using his head once again, to express himself.  He makes fun of Jimmy's ""Afterlife Advice"" video business where the dead can speak to their loved ones through pre-recorded tapes.  He reminds Jimmy of the past, and how he owes him this last favor.

Other characters to enjoy, Jack Warden, an icecream parlor denizen who tells us the story in a sporadic narration, and Steve Buscemi as the hitman who comes to clean up the mess for Walken.  He employs the ""Buckwheats"" method, namely, the bullets go where the sun don't shine.  This is done for a particularly agonizing demise.

I've watched this film several times, and will watch it again.  The roles are strongly portrayed by all, and like I always say, if it's quality, you care about the characters.  This is a film not to be missed, especially  if you admire the work of Andy Garcia and Christopher Walken.",1013126400,5,3427,4.78839590443686

The movie is a classic about a more hidden mafia organisation gone in hiding, and Jimmy 'The Saint' Tosnia (Andy Garcia) trying to live a normal life again. His new found job doesn't really pay as much, and his temptation for one last job with the boss himself ""Man with the Plan"" (Christopher Walken.)gets the better of him.
What happens next is up to you to find out, but I promise you: Loads of action, drama, humour, and GREAT acting is what you'll experience in this great flick! Christopher Walken gets a role he really shines in, Andy Garcia is nothing else but spectacular, there is even a little extra sparcle when Steve Buscemi enters the scene as assassin Mr. Shhh, and actually EVERYBODY in this movie does a marvelous job in their specific roles giving this movie the ""real feel"".
The extras are just clips from interviews with the actors. Some of the interviews seem to jump in the middle of a conversation, and it is hard to get to grips with what is actually being said.

Those of you who have read my reviews know I don't respond to poor films (other than Scary Movie. God erase this movie from the earth!). Things to Do in Denver is for the strange. Andy Garcia is Jimmy the Saint, a man who removed himself from crime to run an Afterlife Video company, but is drawn back in to do an `action piece' by Chris Walken, a quadrapalegic crime boss. Weird enough yet? Add Chistopher Lloyd as Pieces (a leper running a XXX theater) and Treat Williams as a psychopathic lunatic (the best role in his career) and Steve Buschemi as Mr. Shh (a very quiet hit man), and you have one of the strangest movies I have ever seen.

This is for fans of Dark City, Welcome to Woop Woop (if you've missed this film, you have missed the pinnacle of the absurd. See my review), and The Usual Suspects (One of my top 10 Best Movies Ever Made). The tension is high, weirdest reigns, and the empathy for the characters is out the roof. Garcia and Walken are absolutely magnificant. Personally, I don't think Garcia has had a better role. And Walken, well, only the Prophecy series has suited him better. If you enjoy the quirky, this film will suck you in. If you are looking for the Godfather, see ya later. Way too serious. By the way, I will not give away the meaning to `boat drinks', but it will endear you. And in the end, you will realize the weirdness is really reality.

On its surface, this is a fairly commonplace ""caper-gone-wrong"" script, albeit with VERY unusual characters.  But there's a lot more going on than that. First, there is the 'wrapper' involving immortality, and the wish to guide loved ones after death, which seems peripheral - until the ending. Second, there is the love story between Jimmy (Andy Garcia) and Dagney (Gabrial Anwar), two extraordinarilly beautiful people who contrast effectively with the films generally seedy ambiance, and populace. But perhaps the best part is the ""folk-lore"" dispensed by Jack Warden's character.  I have no way of knowing if there is any authenticity to any of it, but if not, so much the better.  I believed it, and was fascinated. I found the performances to be top-drawer, and appropriate.  Walkin's and Williams' scenery-chewing are engaging - as is the underplaying of Garcia and Anwar.  And - as always - Christopher Lloyd manages to concoct a serio-comic stew. Yes, many will be repulsed by a lot of this film, but the film depicts a repulsive 'world', and - in the end - a kind of redemption. It's not for everyone, and will polarize people.

But the other actors were less than perfect, although I always enjoy seeing Christopher Lloyd (of tv's Taxi and the unforgettable Back to the Future films). The premise is basically that Garcia is ""hired"" by gangster Christopher Walken to scare a man who has run off with his strange son's girlfriend. Something like that. I am not even sure I understood who the girl was because the son was so bizarre I cannot imagine that someone would want to be with him. The operation goes sour, people end up dead, and Walken is going to make sure that all the people involved in the operation are dead. Most of them get killed by a professional killer, played well by Steve Buscemi. The film mostly then follows what Garcia does for the rest of the picture. There is a weak and almost annoying love story between Garcia and a woman he met in a club (played by Gabrielle Anwar).

While I love all of Quentin Tarantino's films, I don't believe any of his work can live up to a film such as this (with the exception of maybe ""Pulp Fiction"").  Andy Garcia plays Jimmy the Saint, an ex-mafioso that gets pulled back into the business by The Man With The Plan (Christopher Walken, that's the only name we get).  To unfamiliar ears, the story might sound familar and worn out.  It is not, in fact screenwriter Scott Rosenberg puts an entirely different spin on the plot, keeping this audience in suspense until the very last closing credit.
This movie works on several different levels.  First, the casting was phenonminal.  Andy Garcia, Treat Williams, Christopher Lloyd, Bill Nunn, Gabrielle Anwar, William Forsythe and Christopher Walken comprise the ensemble cast.  Second, Scott Rosenberg's irresistable knack for clever dialogue and twisted plots will always be a crowd pleaser.

779246,4,6304106041,"THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD is the highly stylized tale of doomed ex-mobster ""Jimmy the Saint"" Tosnia, played brilliantly by Andy Garcia, who is forced to perform one last job for his crippled, sadistic, former boss known as ""The Man With The Plan""(Christopher Walken), so that Jimmy can save his failing business, ""Afterlife Advice"", a video service for dying customers who wish to leave behind pearls of wisdom for their progeny.
The job seems simple enough. The Man is convinced that the only salvation for his fat, dim-witted, child-molesting son Bernard is to re-unite him with his former girlfriend, who has run off to California with a hunkish wannabe orthodontist.  But how to supplant the dental Adonis with pudgy psycho Bernard?  ""She loved him for six years, she can learn to love him again"", reasons The Man.  The Man has inside information that the orthodontist is driving back to Denver for the purpose of asking for his lover's hand in marriage and the plan is to intercept him on the highway.  Jimmy's task is to convince the orthodontist by any means necessary that it would not be in his best interest to continue his love interest.
No job worth doing is worth doing alone, so Jimmy recruits his over-the-hill crew with the promise of 10K each.  The wilted bunch includes ""Franchise"" (William Forsythe) now managing a trailer park for free rent, ""Pieces"" (Christopher Lloyd) eking out a living as a porn-house projectionist while his toes and fingers are falling off owing to circulatory problems, ""Critical Bill"" (Treat Williams) who stays in shape by pummeling the corpses at the funeral home he works in, and ""Easy Wind"" (Bill Nunn), who hates Critical Bill for his jailhouse antics involving fecal matter.
Naturally they botch the job and The Man With The Plan issues a collective death sentence known as ""buckwheats"", a euphemism for being shot in the rectal area, thus insuring a slow and painful death.  Jimmy the Saint is given a reprieve from The Man as long as he leaves Denver within 48 hours.  Eschewing the easy way out, however, Jimmy soon proves that he isn't called Jimmy the Saint for nothing.
The rest of the film is a dark, hauntingly poetic exercise in desperation as Jimmy attempts to save the lives of his crew, manage a doomed romance with new-found love Dagney (Gabrielle Anwan), right a wrong done to heart-of-gold hooker Lucinda (played deliciously by Fairuza Balk), and finally to settle accounts with The Man.
THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD has so many linguistic and visual gems it is difficult to give them adequate acknowledgment in this space, but you'll soon be adding pithy phrases such as ""Boat drinks"" and ""Give it a name"" to spice up your language.  In another clever device, Jack Warden as a former wise guy and Bill Cobbs as a soda jerk are wonderful as the muses who provide the narrative glue throughout the film while holding court for the curious each day in a Denver malt shop.
It's not a perfect film, but it's a damn good one with numerous outstanding performances, memorable characters, and a highly original, well-conceived, well-written story that has not received the acclaim it deserves.",974937600,7,3177,4.859519408502773
779247,5,6304106041,"I,too, agree with other reviewers;This is a vastly underrated film. Then,again Andy Garcia is also a vastly underrated actor. Some critics thought he pigeon-holed himself by playing repeated mobster-like characters since his role in The Godfather III; Not so. He tends to take roles that not only may be a challenge but seem to have a personal meaning to him. Mr. Garcia is definitley not an ""I'll- do -anyhing- for- the- money""type actor. He comes across as an actor with integrity and style ! He knows how to romance the ladies on screen and deliver emotional performances without losing credibility to the macho roles. In fact, it just does the opposite for him ! Also, he does much for the Latino community and culture...
While Things To Do may not have garnered the high praise it should have or the box office dollar it still holds up for its awesome actors, story line, and it's sometimes slight, dark-edged humor. Pieces the character played by Christopher Lloyd and Steve Buschemi as Mr. Shhh are killer (no pun intended) roles ! Treat Williams as Critical adds to the harsh and somewhat violent nature but otherwise entertaining atmosphere of the movie. This is a highly recommended sleeper. Don't miss.",973123200,3,1213,4.893203883495145
779248,5,6304106041,"I never heard of this movie until I rented it and then I bought the DVD as soon as I bought my player. This is one of the most underrated movies of all time.
Andy Garcia is Jimmy the Saint, a reformed mobster who runs a video service for people that are terminally ill. The business is failing and his old mob boss (Christopher Walken) calls on him to make good on a loan. The job of Jimmy and his chosen team is to rough someone up, but the job goes all wrong ..... the rest you can guess from the title of the movie.
The supporting cast is a bunch of B list actors who score A plus performances. Steve Buschemi even appears as a hit man who doesnt have much to say. The character of Critical Bill is priceless and offers one of my favorite movie lines of all time ""I AM GODZILLA, YOU ARE JAPAN!!!"".
Garcia offers his usual reserved acting, but it fits nicely with this role and he does a convincing job when the emotions get fired up near the end of the movie.  His lines that he uses on Gabrielle Anwar are a little over the top or ""clunky"" as Jimmy the Saint would say, but overall Garcia does a good job with the role.
Christopher Walken is excellent as the man with the plan. Then again, he was born to play the bad guy. He doesnt dissapoint with this portrayal.
The editing and lighting of the film add to the film where they should. The ending doesnt dissapoint, after all in a film like this you don't expect everyone to live happily ever after. The DVD version doesnt offer anything spectacular in the area of extras, but as much as I love this film it was a must have DVD for me and I think if you see it you will agree.",970704000,,1631,4.112852664576803
779334,3,6304106041,"THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD does begin with somereally overt Tarantino-esque dialog and scene set up.  Look at theingredients: black humor, B-list actors in ""cool"" roles (specifically Jack Warden), a chintzy malt shop and some crude-but-colorful dialog.  ...Basic plot: Andy Garcia has retired from mob life to a little video-service company.  This business isn't doing well, so the local mob boss makes Garcia an offer he can't refuse.  Garcia meets the girl of his dreams, and gets a team of misfits together to pull off the job the mob boss has blackmailed him into.  The job is botched, and the rest of the story ensues.
This movie doesn't exactly jibe at first, and it takes it about 30 minutes to hit it's stride.  Once it does, however, there are a lot of things to admire.  The ensemble is great, especially William Forsythe, Treat Williams, Steve Buscemi (playing one of his trademark ""indie"" characters)and Christopher Lloyd.  Fairuza Balk also gives a good performance of a mistreated hooker who wants to get out of ""the life.""
Throughout, Garcia's character behaves out of duty, and numerous people tell him during the course of the movie that he's ""noble."" His acting job isn't Oscar-worthy, but he gives a quiet power to his role, and does manage to bring gravity to the movie.
THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD turns out to be worth it.  It's got some interesting (if hard-to-understand) dialog, atypical situations, light-handed black comedy, and some surprisingly touching moments.  Despite some minor cracks, it's overall a solid movie.  END",960854400,12,1577,4.980916030534351
779335,5,6304106041,"The worst thing about Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead was probably its publicity campaign. It definitely deserved much more attention than it received. This is a fantastic movie in the gangster tradition, focusing on the costs of loyalty, love and a violent lifestyle. It starts out relatively straight-forward, even a little predictable, but then takes a wild left about 20 minutes into the movie down a dark, blackly humorous path. You won't think of the word ""buckwheat"" without laughing and cringing. I'd tell you more, but it might ruin the plot. Suffice to say, it's a must-see.",947116800,2,592,4.93

More than most, It's the kind of thing you like if you like that kind of thing.  At a minimum, the pre-gentrification locations shot in Denver are good for a couple of stars and, despite the opinion of certain overcompensated ""reviewers,"" one thing it isn't is a Pulp Fiction rip-off.

Yah, there are some outrageously twisted scenes but that's Film Noir for you.  Much more than usual, if you're on the tipping point, I'd recommend *watching* Denver rather than taking a pass.

Chances are that you'll find something cool to do with Denver.",1518307200,,656,4.660869565217391
