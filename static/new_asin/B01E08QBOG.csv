7728960,5,B01E08QBOG,"This is a fine family-oriented film which fortunately doesn't dwell on religion or become preachy, like similar releases. The cast all turn in nice performances and kids should enjoy the focus on horses and trick-riding training and contests. There is a mild romance aspect to keep things interesting in that department, too!",1467504000,2,325,5.269230769230769

8757458,5,B01E08QBOG,"As someone who has read the series and followed the blog while the movie was being filmed, This was done very beautifully.  As with so many movies which start out as a written book and changed to fit for the big screen.  I feel this was so much better than I had hoped it would be.  I rented the movie on Amazon, and I'll be buying a copy as this is one I want in my collection to watch every time I need a beautiful movie about God and Love.  We need more inspirational movies out there for families to enjoy together.  You could see and feel the chemistry between the two main actors, which helped to cement the story together. The horses were all well trained and the reining was top notch and fun to watch.  When I read the books in this series I said it needs to be made into a movie as the story felt so real and I'm am so glad it was made into this movie.",1497225600,4,862,3.9825581395348837
