3876382,3,B00295SKZ6,"It would only play the first 3 shows otherwise it was nice to show my daughter some of my childhood memories, and instill a good lesson thats lost these days of little girls can dress different and funky (not trashy) and still be spunky and fun!",1325721600,,245,4.3478260869565215
3876383,5,B00295SKZ6,"I used to watch Punky Brewster as a kid and remember loving it. I bought this for my 8 yr old daughter to watch and she loves it! She showed it to her cousin and she watched a few episodes and borrowed it to watch the rest. It is nice because it shows the first episodes in chronological order. Overall, I give it 5 stars! I ordered 4 items within 2 days from different sellers and punky was the last item I ordered, but it was the first to arrive!!! Excellent speedy delivery!!!",1308614400,,479,4.161290322580645
3876384,5,B00295SKZ6,This dvd contains the first few episodes of Punky. Our favorite is the first one where we get to know Punky and her background story. Both of my kids really like it (4 and 7).,1301616000,,175,4.0285714285714285

3876386,5,B00295SKZ6,"This dvd is just 8 episodes not a full season but is price accordingly. It has the most important episodes to introduce people to punky that might not have seen the orginal show. It has the episodes when she first meets Henry and how they came to live together. It has her becoming friends with Cherie and taking over Henry's house in her colorful punky style. I enjoyed the show when I was a kid and my kids now love punky. I have the complete 4 seasons. I bought this as a gift for one of my daughter's friends who has a golden retriver like Brandon! It was a great gift without spending too much money to see if she liked the show and now that she loves punky too, her mom has bought the seasons. Her mom like me was happy there is a show that even after years still teaches great lessons and kids love to watch!",1291766400,2,815,4.132075471698113
3876387,4,B00295SKZ6,"If you've already purchased Shout! Factory's release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punky-Brewster-Season-One/dp/B00020X83Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punky Brewster - Season One</a>, there's no need to waste your time here, because this is a budget re-package of ten episodes from that season, released via Shout!'s licensing deal with Mill Creek.  On the plus-side, this DVD will be an ideal Christmas stocking stuffer, or a good ""starter"" disc for those who want a small sampling of the show before committing to full seasons.

Episodes included are:

* Miss Adorable
* Yes Punky, There is a Santa Claus (Parts 1 & 2)
* Play It Again, Punky (aka Punky in the Music Business)
* Henry Falls in Love (Parts 1 & 2)
* My Aged Valentine
* I Love You Brandon
* Fenster Hall (Parts 1 & 2)

There are NO special features included (the Shout! set includes recent interviews with Cherie Johnson and Ami Foster, plus episodes from the Saturday morning cartoon series ""It's Punky Brewster"").  For the price, however, these are some of the all-time classic PUNKY BREWSTER stories from the first year (""Miss Adorable"", ""My Aged Valentine"" and the two-part ""Henry Falls in Love"" are standouts).  ""Fenster Hall"" was an attempt for a PUNKY spin-off but functions well as a special hour-length season finale.

Good for the price, but PUNKY fans will want the full season.",1287705600,15,1402,5.345454545454546
3876388,2,B00295SKZ6,"I own all four seasons of Punky on dvd and each one was worth purchasing.  I actually bought this item out of curiosity to see if there were any bonuses or anything new added.  It was only $5, but even that was too much.  It's only 8 episodes as described, all that were already included on the season one set.  They aren't even all the best of the season.  They are the first 8 from Punky Finds a Home Part 1 to Go to Sleep/A Visit to the Doctor.  They stop short of one of the best, Miss Adorable.  But I'm guessing that is on the next volume.  So basically, this seems to be the first volume of the first season split into separate discs.

The box is plastic and is unnecessarily large, almost as big as the full season set, and only contains one disc which is housed in a black envelope.  I don't know why they couldn't use a regular slim disc case, to take up less space and keep it from getting scratched by sliding it in the envelope.  What a waste of packaging.

No bonuses and no new cover artwork, either.  Just a different menu set up.  I had mine sitting around for a few months unplayed, just taking up room.  It's just silly and doesn't make sense to have released this.  I suppose this would be good for someone who wants to sample the show without paying full price for the whole season.  Or if you don't care about bonus materials.  But if you like the show, or are buying it for kids, it's worth spending the extra cash for more episodes, plus bonus interviews and cartoons that you get on those.

I say skip these volumes and get season 1.  If you have the seasons, skip this entirely.  This dvd is just a waste of space.

2 stars - 5 stars for the quality of the show, 1 star for the product (packaging, no extras).  Just not worth buying.",1255132800,13,1759,4.1850746268656716
3876389,3,B00295SKZ6,"I am wondering why this is being released.  The complete live action series has been released over 4 season sets and Season 1 volume was released separately last year.  The complete animated series minus the episode ""The Shoe Must Go On"" was released as bonus features in the season sets.  The description does not mention any bonus features so I would recommend the season sets.  If this set contained the Punky Brewster cartoon ""The Shoe Must Go On"" then I would buy it for the episode that Shout Factory did not release in their box sets.",1247702400,6,541,4.604166666666667
