8462780,4,B005966MCU,the video and audio was better than I expected. Clear and crisp audio. My SVS sub reallty did a good job on the double bass. The video quality was very good considering done in the 80's,1357516800,,185,4.166666666666667
8462781,5,B005966MCU,"It is a must for anyone who loves Peterson.
Sound is excellent considering time passed.
Image is not so good,but again it was recorded
some time ago.",1334102400,,149,4.555555555555555
8462782,5,B005966MCU,"The title says it all -- this is Oscar's touring trios of the time with bassist Dave Young and drummer Martin Drew. It appears to be a large venue, perhaps outdoors. Video quality and production are very good for the time(1988), the audio is very good and the sound mix is quite musical.

The folks who write the very limited documentation appear to be both careless and ignorant -- the drummer is listed as Kenny Drew, who was a well known PIANIST (and an African-American), not a drummer. Martin Drew is white. Why can't they do the simple homework to identify the players and the tunes?  Why must we depend on musically aware customers to provide this basic information? They would likely sell a lot more DVDs if we knew what they were trying to sell us!
