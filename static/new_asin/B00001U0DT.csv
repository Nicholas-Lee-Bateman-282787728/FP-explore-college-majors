1246351,5,B00001U0DT,"messrs. nelson, mallon, and murphy are too damned talented and funny not to be working. with all the mediocrity that passes for humor these days, we need these guys more than ever.
as the film crew they did good work; so i'm begging; please shout! factory,
contract these three to cheese more bad movies. you'd be doing a great service to us consumers who appreciate intelligent humor.also, there will never be a shortage of bad movies. each new year provides more and more dreck that needs a good cheesing.a good example would be spielberg's remake of 'war of the worlds.' that movie just begs for nelson, mallon and murphy.
whatever, you decide shout! factory, i'll still love you for releasing the complete ""freaks and geeks"" box set. imo, the best dvd release ever!",1219363200,,769,4.7894736842105265
1246352,5,B00001U0DT,"I ordered this set before they revealed their choice for the four movies, and I am so BEYOND thrilled and excited, I can't even tell you!
Future War is one of the most hilarious, AWFUL, fantastic episodes the team ever did, and I have been crossing all my fingers and toes that they would release it some day.
And to top that off, a movie with Joe Estevez? Is it my birthday? How did they know?
I love you, MST3K team. And I love whomever we have to blame for this set!",1219017600,2,469,4.108695652173913
1246353,5,B00001U0DT,"I whole-heartedly agree with reviewer B.Vereen ... 'Laserblast' from 1978 is pretty much worth the price of admission to this box set.  MST3K (arguably.  My Argument) was at its best when they picked on the low-rent offerings of the late 1970s (Angel's Revenge, Parts: The Clonus Horror, etc.).  These movies are bad, but also highly entertaining, and 'Laserblast' - about a boy, a found lasergun, and the damage that ensues - is really highly entertaining.  It was the last show for Comedy Central and Mike and Bots really gave it the old community college try.  It's one of their funniest episodes ever. -- Also included in the set is 'Werewolf' with Joe Esteves (or, as Mike drily points out ""Can a movie actually STAR Joe Esteves?"").  It stars a beautiful woman with an indecipherable accent and some werewolves (I think) and this episode also stands as one of their best.  The bumper segments for the SCIFI channel are sometimes too ambitious and busy, but the movies never disappoint.  As a 20th anniversary offering, this box set delivers the goods.",1217376000,17,1056,4.860335195530726
1246354,5,B00001U0DT,"This set features one episode with Joel Hodgson as host and three with Mike Nelson hosting. Two episodes are from the Comedy Central years while two are from the Sci-Fi Channel shows.

211- First Spaceship on Venus
Originally called Der Schweigende Stern and made in 1960, this international cast film about the first astronauts to land on Venus is a hoot. Filled with wonderful ideas about international cooperation, yet strangely dated in its science even for when it was made, this movie's vision of the future is fun, action-filled and nearly breaks the goofy meter! The jokes are endless, non-stop and really top-notch from the MST3K crew. ""What's a herring weigh? Oh, about a pound."" ""Everything's better in the crawler copter."" Just the endless jokes about the robot in the film, Omega, will keep you laughing throughout. The host segments are just awesomely funny. When the planet has it's ""brown explosion"" near the end you'll be rolling with laughter and the jokes fly really fast at that point. This is a sometimes overlooked, underrated classic that is too funny to describe. I love it and never get tired of watching it no matter how many times I see it.

706- Laserblast
This 1978 feature comprises the final episode from Comedy Central and is an odd little feature that received 2.5 stars from Leonard Maltin, a fact that is the source of endless wonderful wisecracks as the credits roll. Hilarious throughout in spite of the fact that everyone working on the show knew it might be their last one ever. The host segment wrap-up with great 2001: A Space Odyssey references is terrific.

904- Werewolf
This 1996 feature with Richard Lynch is even more ridiculous than most stories based on lycanthropy. The goofy meter breaks in the first reel of this film and never gets repaired. An archaeologist gets cut by the skeleton of a werewolf and so, predictably, becomes one. The acting, bad foreign accents, and other low-budget silliness in this film are hammered mercilessly by MST3K. The host segment where Mike and the 'Bots are a girl group singing a teen tragedy song, a sort of like ""Leader of the Pack"" type number, is absolutely killer funny.

1004- Future War
This 1997 video feature is so bad it is beyond words. The huge headed Robert Zdar appears in his second film done on MST3K (the other was Soultaker) and his acting is just as stiff as in the other movie. The film features terrible looking rubber dinosaurs, mediocre martial arts-style action sequences, a hackneyed formulaic plot and acting so bland that calling it wooden would be a compliment! Fortunately, it has enough movement and scene changes to at least fuel a barrage of great jokes from MST3K. It's fun, but only thanks to the MST3K treatment. By itself, this film would be unwatchable.

This set will have a Crow figurine, collector cards, a video segment showing the MST3K reunion panel at Comic-Con from July 2008 and possibly more as yet unannounced features. Highly recommended!",1217289600,89,2973,4.879207920792079
1246355,5,B00001U0DT,"This review is for the episodes in this set, not the set itself (although the artwork looks spiffy!)

211- First Spaceship on Venus  A controversial add among fans, but this episode unnecessarily gets a bad rap.  The basic movie is about a multinational space expedition to Venus (a theme in a least of couple of later MST3K experiments).  Goofy of course, and funny, but the host segments are fun (others disagree, but who cares?)  The Brain's own ""Amazing Colossal Episode Guide""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-Amazing-Colossal-Episode-Guide/dp/B000K38W84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mystery Science Theater 3000 : Amazing Colossal Episode Guide</a>&nbsp;indicate that this wasn't one of their favorites, but they have said that about lots of MST3K episodes that others enjoy.  Your mileage, of course, may vary but any early MST3K is worth a look.

706- Laserblast  This was the final experiment of Season 7, and indeed the era of hours upon hours of MST3K as filler on Comedy Central.  It's the Cadillac of this set, and almost worth the price of admission.  The movie is priceless - an androgynous, hopelessly attractive loner finds an arm-sleeve laser gun in the desert, and is quickly seduced by its power. Seduced?  No, he's turned into an alien.  After tasting the fruits of his forbidden power, our hero goes on a rampage.  He doesn't rob banks or blast bad guys, he goes after Eddie Deezen, cast out of type as a annoying geek (and kind of a bully, too.)  The host segments involve the end of the SOL's funding, with Pearl pulling the literal plug.  Our heroes go off to the void, and Dr. Forrester finds a 2001-esqu fate.  A keeper, and I'm delighted to find this more or less permanently preserved on DVD at last!

904- Werewolf (aka ""Wahr-wilf"").  One of the better episodes from the unfortunately truncated Season 9 - it stars, well someone, with an unfortunate encounter with the teeth of a wolf skull involving stitches.  It also stars perennial B-movie villain Richard Lynch, with a low-rent cameo from Joe Estevez as a sun-addled native archaeologist day laborer.  Check out the impossibly predictable twist ending.  The host segments are about as good as MST3K has ever generated - Mike attempts escape (and is quickly detected by the otherwise incompetent Pearl, Professor Bobo, and Brain Guy).  There's even a nifty song, ""Where O Werewolf"".

1004- Future War  By this time the show was on the way out the door, but in the last couple of years MST3K featured some really cheesy bad 1990s-era monster movies.  This one is actually not as bad as many, if you can get past the rubber dinosaurs. (Plot? Oh yeah, a man from the future visits a la Terminator, quickly followed by man-eating dinosaurs - or something).  The host segments are serviceable, involving dropping LSD, kick boxing, and making fun of someone's facial-deforming illness (never said MST3K was a great family show).

I had the pleasure of interviewing the cinematographer of ""Future War"", and his attitude towards the MST3K treatment of his film was delightful.  The crew of ""Future War understand MST3K, and they have a terrific sense of humor.  This is a better episode than most, and it's great to have it on immortal DVD.

On balance, there are some unusual choices for this box set, but it sounds like Shout Factory is on the right track.  Looking forward to many future box sets.",1217203200,55,3453,5.101604278074866
1246356,4,B00001U0DT,"I, like many MSTies, believe some of the Best Brains' best work was done in the short-subjects that preceded some of the movies. But by the time the 'Shorts 2' compilation tape was being assembled, the cream had already been skimmed off into 'Shorts 1' and 'Mr B's Lost Shorts.' What's left here is not uniformly top-notch, although some of them are not bad.
I've commented on the movies at more length on the individual videos' own pages. 'Catalina Caper' is one of my very favorite episodes, and captures all of the energy and rambunctiousness that especially characterized the early seasons. I think it's great. 'The Skydivers' has some of my favorite individual riffs and memorable host segments (like the Battle of the Swing Choirs), but the movie itself is so depressingly bad that even I find it hard to watch at points.
For the MSTie who covets everything the Brains committed to video (like me), it's a bargain to stock up on 3-packs like this. But if you're only looking for the top-quality stuff, I might recommend buying 'Catalina Caper' individually, and taking a pass on the other two.",1006905600,,1099,4.7894736842105265
1246357,3,B00001U0DT,"This three-pack is definitely a mixed bag.  ""Skydivers"" follows the Coleman Francis formula of endless reaction shots and ""cinematography by grunge"" to a tee.  Wonderfully action-free,  this movie is a good example of doing something very funny with almost  nothing at all. ""Catalina Caper"" plays like Gilligan's Island  meets Love Boat.  Thrill to Tom Servo's crush on ""creepy girl""  and see Lyle Waggoner get beaten up -- worth the price of admission.  ""Shorts II"" appears to have been slapped together, perhaps after  the cancellation of the series -- I can think of no other reason for the  selection of these very-unfunny shorts.  We were turned off after the  first, ""Catching Trouble"", featuring some Numbnuts dragging  helpless bear cubs and wildcats out of the swamp for the ""humane""  environs of some un-named zoo.  We found ourselves hoping he'd be chomped  by the rattlesnakes he set out to catch, but no such luck.  Mike and the  'bots seemed as bummed by this film as we were.  It didn't get better --  the Union Pacific showed teens being killed in railroad crossing accidents,  and their own shopworkers maimed by carelessness.  What a hoot (NOT!) The  exclusion of classic shorts like ""Here comes the Circus"",  ""Hired II"" and ""Are you ready for Marriage?"" is a major  gaffe.  Watch the two movies; keep your ""Shorts"" wrapped.",946512000,5,1342,4.959276018099548
1246358,5,B00001U0DT,"This collection of MST3K tapes has..
Catalina Caper is MST3K at it's best. This episode is from season 2 (#204) so the jokes are kind of old but it's still great. One reason why this video is so great is cause has the  ""Creepy Girl"" song that Tom Servo sings. The movie has  ""Tommy Kirk"" in it so you know that Joel & the bots are going  to make great riffs...
Shorts II has a great collection of shorts from  MST3K. CATCHING TROUBLE was good. WHAT TO DO ON A DATE was a funny one.  LAST CLEAR CHANCE is the best short on the tape. A DAY AT THE FAIR is the  third funniest. KEEPING CLEAN is the second best short. THE DAYS OF OUR  YEARS had Mike & the bots at a high. Overall this video  RULES!
Skydivers is a season 6 episode(#609). This episode has the short,  ""Why Study Industrial Arts?"" and this was just a great short that  and Mike & the bots riffed. The movie was very lame and dull but Mike  & the bots do an good job of making it funny. All of the segments were  just so great.
So I suggest you get this collection of MST3K tapes for  any MST3K fan. Enjoy...",945302400,7,1068,4.0285714285714285
1246359,5,B00001U0DT,"Catalina Caper is by far one of the funniest and cleverest episodes of MST3K.  The movie itself is so bad it's funny, and the crew of the SOL take every advantage.  Highlights include Tom Servo singing Creepy Girl, and the  host segment where Joel and the 'Bots argue about the plot (as if the movie  has one) is hilarious.  Look out for Little Richard, the only person in the  film with any talent.  Unfortunately, his appearance is brief.
Skydivers  is also very funny.  Mike and the 'Bots provide many laughs during the  riveting inaction of the film.  This film contains many dull scenes such as  a long conversation which revolves around having coffee, and the  sociopathic stereotypes in the film provide a few laughs of their own.  Fortunately, the crew of the SOL really ""milk"" the coffee  conversation for many wonderful jokes throughout. Coleman Francis, who  wrote other ""gems"" like Beast of Yucca Flats, wrote the  screenplay and it shows.
As for Shorts 2, all I can say is that MST3K  never met a short at which they didn't hurl good jokes.  Catching Trouble  and Keeping Neat and Clean are two of the ""best of the best.""  MSTies who've never seen the episodes containing these shorts should not  miss the chance to see these now.",940291200,18,1243,4.683720930232558

1246398,4,B00001U0DT,"The usual pattern seems to be two great, one good, and one not-so-good. In this case, the better three are all  from mid-to-later MST3K; those who prefer the Joel era may have a correspondingly unapproving opinion. Since another reviewer praises precisely the episode I disliked here, I give my reasons (and individual grades) below:

LASERBLAST has adequate picture and sound, decent editing and pacing, and interesting host segments. The riffing is inspired on several levels -- not just cracks but running gags, and the throwaway comments were vastly outnumbered by others that were witty or timely [including some not caught until the second or third viewing]. Add in inspired host segments and you have a classic. A-

FUTURE WAR likewise isn't so terrible a production, featuring some very good cinematography. But it's not here by accident, with more than enough fodder for plentiful and varied riffing. Solidly entertaining MST3K, good rewatch value.  C+ to B [depending on how you feel about the laughably unrealistic dinosaurs]

To me, WEREWOLF pegs the needle for MST3K hilarity -- only a handful equal it, and none are better. Another film whose production doesn't strain our eyes or ears but still reveals a truly terrible film. And by ""terrible"" I mean ""begging to be mocked at every corner"", which the boys do and then some, leaving no aspect sacrosanct. Like LASERBLAST, there are running gags and strong host segments. Even the end-credits are a highlight. In short, MST3K perfection. A

And then there's FIRST SPACESHIP TO VENUS, an episode so unmemorable that I can't remember anything except wishing it was over less than halfway through [despite having seen it twice]. Like many MST episodes, the ""bad"" here is just tedious, dull slogging through a nothingness of non-cinema -- MANOS minus the material. This understandably doesn't inspire much humor, and this episode largely trudges along with less (and less-inspired) quips from the boys. The Joel era still has unreleased episodes much better than this [even now, in 2013]; this one could have been left in the vault. D",1358812800,2,2093,5.105263157894737

This may have been up there with the funniest shows of all time and when they first aired I could hear them just fine.  Now my hearing is not as good.  To release ANY DVD without an option for subtitles or closed captions is a direct insult to those with hearing disabilities.  To release THESE shows that totally depend on short quips is unforgivable.  To all those that trash my reviews for holding fast to this point of view. someday you are most likely to be in the same spot and you will not find it funny or off mark then.

Most of the cultures around the world revere the older ones among them.  The US hides them or ignores them.  I don't care to be revered, just taken as a normal citizen and have products made that I can enjoy as well as others.  The SHAMING AND DISMISSAL OF AGE should be a cause for great shame for the US and it is a sign of our demise that we dismiss them.

1246420,5,B00001U0DT,"For people who are relatively new to this show like me, this is probably the best value as far as the box sets go, extras-wise anyway.  The usual lobby cards & trailers are there, but it's the feature-length(about 80 min) 20-yr history of mst 3000 and the entertaining reunion at the 2008 comic-con(almost 40 min) hosted by patton oswald that really make this set stand out.  Unfortunately, the history feature is broken down into 3 parts and spread out on 3 discs.  I would've preferred a 'same disc/play all' option.  Since i'm a late adopter(barely bought this a month ago), apparently i missed out on a crow figurine.

Anyway, if you're on the fence or on a budget, since the box sets are kinda pricey, i suggest you add all of them to your cart and check in now & then.  Amazon tends to go crazy once in awhile and offer big sales on these.  When i checked on my cart and it updated the price for this set at $26 in march, i jumped on it.  A few others i've grabbed for $30 or less as well, all new, and one came with the tom servo figure.

Either way, they are all worth it.  Great show that i'm sorry to have been so late on discovering, let alone collecting.  Btw, besides the great extras you do get 4 very good episodes.

1246423,5,B00001U0DT,"""We'll send him cheesy movies/the worst we can find (lalala!)/he'll have to sit and watch them all/while we monitor his mind...""

A simple yet hilarious premise for a TV series -- a guy is trapped in the ""Satellite of Love"" with a bunch of sarcastic robots, and is forced to watch (and mock) cheesy sci-fi movies. ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: 20th Anniversary Edition"" brings together four spectacularly awful movies from years apast -- some are boring, some are stupid, and some are BOTH.

One episode features the low-key, somewhat mellow Joel, while the other three feature the perky everyman Mike Nelson. As usual, they're being tortured either by the goofily evil Dr Forester or the equally goofily evil Pearl -- with bad cinema.

Among the movies mocked here: ""First Spaceship on Venus,"" a sluggish and boring sci-fi saga with extremely poor dubbing; ""Laserblast,"" in which a very dumb teenager finds an alien weapon that turns him into a smaller version of the Hulk; ""Future War,"" a ridiculous yet pompous story about cyborgs and tiny attack dinosaurs; and ""Werewolf,"" an inept tale of a cursed skeleton, a Russian scientist with the world's most ridiculous accent, and  werewolves driving cars.

Obviously these movies aren't the absolute rock-bottom wretchedness of filmmaking (ie ""Manos the Hands of Fate"") but they are spectacularly awful. Everything here is worthy of mockery -- the bad special effects, the cardboard characters, silly cinematography (the girl who can't run through a mud puddle) and ever-changing hair.

But of course, the endless stream of mockery turned out by Mike, Joel and the robots is absolutely gutsplitting. They constantly snark bad continuity (""Did those oil barrels just leap out in front of him?""), stupid characters (mock the stupid Russian chick's accent -- ""You and Noel is in it for fame and fortune? But over my dead body!"") and constant running jokes (the guys never stop mentioning that the atrocious ""Laser Blast"" was awarded TWO AND A HALF STARS by Maltin).

Even the framing stuff is hilarious, as we watch Joel trying to impress Dr. Forester with his junk-drawer invention and Mike trying to escape the Satellite of Love. And there are the usual minor disasters, such as Mike becoming a WereCrow (""... and you know, I'm perfectly comfortable with that, yeah"").

The movies are awful, the snark is hilarious, and the robots are sarcastic (""Let me anoint your beak with scented oils!""). Assuming that ""First Spaceship on Venus"" doesn't lull you to sleep, this is an entertaining way to spend an evening.",1276732800,,2557,5.0570071258907365

I streamed these four movies online so I did not get to watch any special features, including the 2008 cast reunion at ComicCon :( The four movies in this collection are all SUPER-cheesy flicks given the MSTie treatment. Werewolf is the kind of movie that after about 2 minutes you would walk out of in a theater...bad acting and thick accents, horrible plot and special effects...perfect for Mike, Tom Servo and Crow tee it up and drive it out of the park. Laserblast is ""like Porky's, without the charm"". I noticed a continuity error in Laserblast when Billy finds the laser, he puts the necklace on, but when he is shooting it is back in his hand. There are lots of laugh-out-loud moments so definitely worth checking out...I could care less about the Joel versus Mike argument, they are both VERY funny and make these stinkers smell like roses.",1266710400,,938,4.6909090909090905

Now, let's get to the movies!

First Spaceship On Venus, Show 211, is one of those episodes I missed watching on MST3K but did see on TV in real life.  And I happened to like it for the way they handled the settings, alien technology and future human technology.  I liked the international feel to the film.  But the plot sucks.  And the message is boring - technology gets out of control, we're all going to die.  YAWN.  But I did like the film's robot and of course Joel and the Bots helped me get through the movie without falling asleep.

LaserBlast, Show 706, is the last MST3K that ran on Comedy Central.  This is also the first time I got to see it in any form and, frankly, the movie is really bad.  No, even with Mike and the Bots making fun of it the thing stinks.  I don't want to give too much away but here is a list of random stuff - clay aliens, laser weapon, the MASK, spaceships, bad video effects.  Loved the way the MST3K ended the show with the last segment.  How many sci-fi movies can you spot?

Werewolf, Show 904, starring Joe Estevez is a bad film but one that isn't too bad.  Still, once again I am not sure if the werewolf had anything to do with werewolves.  In fact it seems to be a Native American Skin Walker.  And sometimes it looked more like a puppet or some kind of sick cat.

Future War, Show 1004, has Robert Z'Dar from Soultaker, exploding, self-cleaning, dinosaurs and lots of flashbacks.  Jokes about LSD and Clowns will pepper the show and there are also a huge amount of empty boxes.  Oh, and cyborgs.  And kick boxing.  And boxes.  Don't forget the boxes.

The only difference between this version of the MST3K 20th Anniversary Set and the more expensive set is the other comes in a metal tin that will not fit on any shelf and has a really poor quality Crow figurine, so you are not missing out on anything.

1246435,5,B00001U0DT,"My 12 yr. old son bought this for himself with a Christmas gift card.  I introduced him to MST3K because he and I have the same sense of humor (quirky) and he is very bright.  It is hysterical and we watch all 4 videos over and over.  First Spaceship to Venus is the weakest (i.e., least funny) of the 4 films. We think Werewolf is the best with the opera-singing werewolf skeleton, the sexy female ""scientist"" who has an impossible-to-define accent and best of all, a villain with the worst (read: best) hair ever, that changes in every scene.  You will not want to miss Mike's ""Where O Werewolf"" musical number.

1246439,4,B00001U0DT,"I used to believe that the only true MST3K episodes were the ones hosted by Joel Hodgson - but over time I actually shifted positions and now love both of them. I think it was Mike's ""12 To the Moon"" and ""Santa Claus"" episodes that did it (those two NEED to be included in box sets SOON... as well as ""Racket Girls"" and ""Night Of The Blood Beast"" - take note manufacturers...)
  If you don't include Joel's pre-season one, Minnesota TV-Only episodes, Mike has made one or two more episodes than Joel, so there's gonna be a lot of them so don't fight it - relax and let your mind open to Nelson's charm and gentle sarcasm. He's REALLY REALLY good - and if I could learn to love him, anybody can.
  It helps that his episodes in this set are very good - especially ""Future War"". I can finally throw out my old VHS copy, which had poor sound quality. ""Werewolf"" is another fan-favorite ( some actually list this as their favorite episode of MST3K, along with ""Puma Man"" - which should have been included in this set instead of ""Laserblast""; although ""Laserblast"" is a great episode, eps 903 and 904 go together really well and make a heckuva double feature.)
  But then again, ""Laserblast"" and ""Futre War"" make a great double bill as well, so I can't complain too much there...
  But I CAN complain about the Joel episode they included... ""First Spaceship To Venus"" is a poor episode any way you look at it. The only time I laughed during this one was at the very end when the 70's/80's new wave band Devo welcomed the ship back to earth.
  They've been giving us poor-to-fair Joel episodes for awhile now and I'm really disapointed. If they toss us ""Castle Of Fu Manchu"" next time I'll set myself on FIRE... (In case you haven't seen it, that episode makes Mike's ""Hamlet"" episode look like the Laurence Olivier classic. Not a single good comeback by the crew and the film itself is physically painful. You can tell Joel is NOT having a good time.)
  There were only maybe 8 or 9 Joel episodes that I didn't like, making it about a 94% chance that I'd love the one(s) included in a box set - and they've picked almost all of the 'bad' ones to date - ""Women Of the Prehistoric Planet"", ""The Unearthly"", ""Hellcats"", ""Cave Dwellers"", ""Secret Agent Super Dragon"", ""Gunslinger"" and now ""First Spaceship To Venus"" - the only other Joel episodes I didn't like are that Fu Manchu nightmare, ""Mighty Jack"" and the last Gamera episode they did.
  I still can't believe they picked Super Dragon over ""Operation Double 007"" which is another spy flick from the same season - and much better too!
  BUT - at least now there's a heckuva lot of great Joel episodes coming soon... I'm especially looking forward to such classics as ""Rocketship X-M"", ""Master Ninja 1 and 2"", ""Fugitive Alien 1 and 2"", ""MadMonster"", ""The Slime People"", ""Time Of The Apes"", and ""The Day The Earth Froze"".
  To wrap up - this is still a great set, and showcase Mike in a very smart way, as the films he's forced to watch are all fun, and he's in great form. Please learn to accept him, as you're missing out on something really special if you haven't learned to love him yet. He really is something special - it's just that he's a PEER to Crow and Servo, where Joel is their FATHER-figure, so the bots' attitudes and the mood on the ship are different. Once you accept and embrace that difference, you'll start to look forward to seeing more Mike episodes. Seasons 8 and 9 are probably the best seasons of the series (although I personally have a strong fondness for season one - I know, most of you think that's crazy, but I really liked Larry Ehrhardt, Servo's original voice, that awful Radar Men From The Moon serial, and Joel's especially laid-back attitude.)
  Bye - and long live the Satellite Of Love, still hovering above the earth somewhere, crew being forced to watch ""RV"" and ""Mamma Mia""...",1235088000,9,3862,4.513629842180775

Just to get past the slower style of comedy I knew was coming I chose the Joel hosted ""First Spaceship On Venus"" for my initial viewing.  It's a pretty standard episode for the 2nd season with the skits being the more memorable source of comedy (Hooray for TV's Frank!), but the riffing is in need of second viewing to be enjoyed/remembered.  The movie is more boring than bad (until the end) so there is not much for the crew to work with.

""Future War"" however is a different story.  Silly costumes, poor fight choreography, forced perspective and crappy creature effects make this movie ripe for riffing and the crew do it up nice.

""Laserblast"" is a hoot! A failed comic pairing of fat and skinny, pot smoking deputies are endlessly taunted with the had-to-be-there phrase ""It's time for some football!"" While the constantly shirtless Mark Hamill clone and his tight-pantsed mother are ridiculed beyond belief. A very strong episode.

""Werewolf"" is definitely the jewel of the set. The best riffs are at the expense of the sorta hot, but deadpan German(?) female lead. Her line readings themselves are just repeated throughout the film as a reminder of her own unintentional comedic prowess. The villain's ever changing hair color and style are also strong points from which humor is mined. Glad to own this one on DVD!

This is definitely my favorite set of all previous releases I've collected.  The restrospective is enjoyable, but a little stiff and only uses footage from the episodes on this release and the comicon panel is more of a re-hash of the same stories with a live audience laugh track.

The first film, ""First Spaceship on Venus"" is a little allegorical piece about the cold war that is plodding at times, but features great riffing. The science fiction of the film is heavy on the fiction, as it is one of the hokier movies ever mocked by the show. It has a heavy international theme, which makes sense given its European origins.

""Laserblast"" follows the unintentionally hilarious adventures of an outcast and shirtless loser who inherits an extraterrestrial weapon from some hilariously bogus outer space terrapins and pays the price. The film stars nobody, but features the perpetually annoying Eddie Deezen as Froggy, Roddy McDowall as a doctor, and Keenan Wynn as the entirely mental Colonel Farley in one of the most embarrassing roles of his or any other career. I am so happy that this episode is finally out on DVD, as it is truly one of my favorites.

""Werewolf"", while beloved by the cast and crew of MST3K (especially Kevin Murphy), is actually my least favorite of this set. The film is boring and tedium-filled. It is mocked well, but the bulk of the jokes revolve around the terrible accents and mispronunciation of the word ""werewolf."" I like it, just not as much as the others in the set.

""Future War"" is my favorite in the set. The film is a confusing and wonderful blend of dinosaur, karate, and outer space vigilante genres, and is simply one of the goofiest and lamest movies ever made. The forced perspective plastic dinosaurs (which Mike takes to humorous heights in the commentary track) are worse than anything ""Hobgoblins"" presented as a special effect, and rival Ed Wood's worst for believability. I have watched ""Future War"" several times, and it is one of the episodes that never stops being funny.

The set also contains extras such as trailers, a MST3K panel discussion, and a documentary on the making of the show, which are all very interesting and well done.

I highly recommend this set to MST3K lovers or lovers of bad cinema anywhere.",1231718400,2,2451,4.796208530805687

I could take or leave the tin case and the ""Film Cards"", but I love the 3 part series about the history of MST3K (on the first 3 discs) and the ComicCon reunion video on the fourth disc.

For us, the show began and ended with Joel.  When we next tuned in, Joel was gone, Mike was there, and we stopped watching.

So we were quite disappointed to find that, for a product labeled as ""20th anniversary"", three quarters of the episodes were not from the period it is the 20th anniversary _of_.

Now, my spouse could have written down the titles, and checked the wikis to see what she was going to get, but didn't have the time or inclination.  So she read the box, which gives NO indication of who the host of each episode was.  Nor do the individual disks, *with the exception of _First Spaceship on Venus_, which specifically lists Joel*.

The bonus features and packaging are, as other reviewers have pointed out, very nice, but that's not what we were looking for.

I would like to see Shout! more clearly label these releases by host (Rhino was also guilty of ""neglecting"" to mention the host either prominently, or at all, on their boxes).

But that's just my opinion.

There are actual extras, as well as the original movie trailers, something that they have neglected in the Rhino sets, hopefully Shout Factory will continue in this vein.

The fact that these are in their own slim cases with lengthier descriptions on each case gives a little context to the episode as it pertains to MST3K (example: on the back of Laserblast it notes that it was the last Comedy Central episode.)
The bonus features are informative if a little drab, the ""oral history"" is predominately sit down interviews with a few shots from the show dropped in, but the KTMA footage is interesting.  The extras are (as usual) really geared at hardcore fans.

But the episodes in this collection are some of the strongest work in the whole series.  I prefer Mike to Joel(Joel only gets one appearence in this set), and Werewolf and Future War are my favorites of this set.  But First Spaceship on Venus is very funny and Laserblast has some hilarious moments.

As timing would have it, Shout! Factory's first release of Mystery Science Theater 3000 DVDs after obtaining the rights away from Rhino Records coincided with the twentieth anniversary of MST3k's premiere.  They decided to pull out several stops for their first release (although they kept the same number -- 4 -- of actual episodes per box set as Rhino had); besides the episodes themselves, the non-Limited Edition version contains a new documentary detailing the rise and fall of MST3k and a recording of the twentieth anniversary reunion of the core cast/crew from the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con.

While extras are always welcome, it's the episodes that really matter.  Here I believe Shout! Factory has done a good job.  While the split between Joel and Mike hosted episodes is 3 to 1 in favor of Mike, the quality of joke telling is great and highlights MST3k at its best.

FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS

After the discovery of a message from the inhabitants of the second planet in our solar system, an international group of astronauts is sent to Venus to determine if intelligent life has evolved.  In typical 1960s sci-fi movie fashion, much time is spent showing the viewer how the space program of the future works and how space travel really would seem to the astronauts.  This makes the middle third of the movie extremely arduous as we are treated to long sequences of weightless (with the aid of harnesses) people and elderly scientists playing chess against robots.

I'd never seen this episode before, but I had seen the original film (although I'm not sure I was ever able to stay awake during the whole thing).  I found the joking from Joel and the bots to be average at best.  One factor which started to annoy me after some time was a sub-plot wherein Servo's sarcasm sequencer was set to a higher level causing him to make increasingly repetitive sarcastic remarks about the film.  I found this to be a rare mis-fire from the Best Brains.

LASERBLAST

This is the story of a young man so low on the social ladder that he is actually the recipient of Eddie Deezen's bullying.  However, something working in his favor is that he stumbled upon a neat piece of alien technology which attaches to his arm and allows him to fire lasers at his tormentors.  On the downside, the claymation dinosaur aliens are now hunting him to retrieve their lost ray gun.

LASERBLAST was the final episode made for Comedy Central, and while the crew had hopes of the show being picked up by another channel (it eventually was) they were aware that this was potentially the last movie they would have the dubious pleasure of mocking.  It seems appropriate therefore that there is a greater than average number of hilarious call-back jokes to earlier experiments.  The fact that there are a fair number of recognizable faces in the cast (Eddie Deezen, Roddy McDowell, Keenan Wynn) gives the crew many additional avenues for jokes, which they duly capitalize on.

WEREWOLF

Joe ""younger brother of Martin Sheen"" Estevez is infected by an unknown werewolf virus.  The screenplay initially makes a big deal that this is not the standard werewolf story of legend; transformations can occur between any two species.  The film promptly turns into the classic clich of actors getting fur glued to their faces and then having them howl for hours at the moon.

This film (along with FUTURE WAR) is one of the most recent films that MST3k tackled and there are several very 1990s directorial touches.  It's not the worst movie ever, but it is silly, goofy and totally illogical (thus becoming an instant classic episode).  The crew gets a lot of amusement over the fact that the full moon appears to last for a week, and the bad guy infects people with the werewolf virus for no reason other than that he is Evil.

FUTURE WAR

This was an episode that I hadn't watched -- despite having a VHS recording of it  -- since its original broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel.  The reason for avoidance was my memory of the film was so dire that I simply couldn't handle another viewing.  My sole memory was a scene of the Jean-Claude Van Damme looking guy kickboxing Robert Z'Dar in a warehouse of empty cardboard boxes.

So watching this episode brought me two surprises.  One, the riffing from the crew was much better than I had remembered (my theory is that in the ensuing years I've become much more strengthened against bad films and am therefore now able to pay more attention to the jokes).  Two, the only memory I had of the film was wrong, because that scene never occurs in quite that way I had recalled.

I had completely forgotten about the terrible special effect dinosaurs, the mini-skirted nun, and the two huge guys in the halfway house.  You can really smell the 1990s odor coming off of this one, right down to its flannel.  Another case where a movie pitches up softballs to the crew and they hit home run after home run.

Extras

The new documentary is an interesting look at the history of the show, although I doubt there is too much new information that devoted fans don't already know.  However, I did find it informative in its telling of the program's very early days at KTMA.

The panel from the San Diego Comic-Con was hosted by Patton Oswalt (for what reason, I am not privy) and I found it to be slightly disappointing in that the moderator talks too much and the sound quality is not always great.  Still, its nice to see them all together again and I really got a kick out of Frank Conniff asking whether the urban legend about Joe Don Baker wanting to beat up the writers of MST3k was actually true.

Stinger

So I would judge Shout! Factory's first release as a success.  Even ignoring the extras, they've given us one solid and three great episodes.  They've already announced the next release and I can't wait.",1230681600,16,5832,4.689282202556539

Extras

The first thing that struck me about this DVD box set was its sheer imposing physical size; the width of this tin is a hair shy of four old Rhino sets.  It will look very impressive on the shelf, partly because it is really nice looking, but mostly because there won't be room for anything else.  The second thing that struck me was that it was almost impossible to get anything out of the tin because of how tight everything was packed into it.  I nearly snapped the Crow figurine in half before realizing it was affixed into the plastic casing via a plastic tie.

The new documentary is an interesting look at the history of the show, although I doubt there is too much new information that devoted fans don't already know.  However, I did find it informative in its telling of the program's very early days at KTMA.

1246461,1,B00001U0DT,"It's always a dicey proposition when a beloved series goes from one distributor to another, especially when Rhino did such a fantastic job with the MST3K box sets. Sadly,Shout Factory tried but came nowhere near to living up to Rhino's standards.

First, let's discuss the packaging. The limited-edition tin is nice, but it's massive, and needlessly so. The cheesy plastic Crow figure included in the set doesn't merit the mounds of plastic it's buried in, and neither do the thin individual DVD cases or ""lobby cards"". As mentioned in other reviews, the box of DVDs inside the tin are crammed in so tight it's a 50/50 chance that you'll get them out without damaging it. The DVD cases are also prone to slip right out of the box unless you're careful how you hold it. I liked Rhino's fold-out single case much better. The whole tin concept turns out to be more of a pain than an enjoyment, as designed.

Now, on to the DVDs. I popped ""Werewolf"" in and grabbed the remote, ready to jump to the opening movie sequence. I was surprised to find myself about 15 minutes into the episode instead of just after the ""movie sign!"" tunnel scene as Mike & the 'bits just enter the theater. The Rhino sets had chapter stops set either right after each commercial break, or actually at each movie or host segment(don't recall right now). You always knew where you were going with a chapter skip, instead of just landing at some arbitrary spot in the show. They also passed on including chapter selections, all of which seems to point to ways to shave production costs. It comes off feeling like a bare-bones effort, and is rather annoying when you want to jump to or repeat a certain scene. I haven't watched the extras yet, but do appreciate something being included. Three ""History of MST3K"" shorts are included in the set.

Now that the complaining is done, let's discuss the epsiodes. You get two greats, one good, and one mediocre. ""Werewolf"" is one of the most laugh-out-loud funny episodes in series history. It's so poorly conceived that the jokes literally write themselves, but this doesn't stop Mike & the 'bots from ripping off one classic riff after another. Yuri, the man of a 1000 hair-dos, a werewolf with road rage, a female lead with an unidentifiable accent and the acting chops & emotion of a medical cadaver, the inimitable Joe Estevez . . . it's all there in this Tony Zarindast classic. The only thing saving this film from ""Plan 9"" territory is a typical performance by B-movie veteran Richard Lynch. He can deliver the most ridiculous dialogue with convincing professionalism. ""Laserblast"" is another great episode. A truly awful early Charles Band effort, the MST3K treatment adds the fun and laughs. The South's gonna do it again! ""Future War"" is a good episode, falling short of greatness by a few feet. A lot of laughs, but it's one of the films that's so bad there are moments where the boys just seem confounded to rip away. ""First Spaceship on Venus"" is the weakest of the lot. I'm not a huge fan of the Joel era, and this one doesn't do anything to change my thoughts on that. Something better could've been selected, but it is what it is.

In any case, it's great to see MST3K still getting the box-set treatment. This set is must have from a show/episode standpoint. I'm not knocking the episodes at all. However, I hope that Shout Factory gets with it and includes individual chapter stops and jumps. That's all I ask, please!",1228694400,20,3450,4.6694078947368425
1246462,4,B00001U0DT,"I have loved MST3K since I came across it one night in college. Nothing was better then waking up hungover and recouping for 2 hours with a greasy breakfast while watching this show. I liked the Old Tom, I loved the New Tom. I liked Joel, I loved Mike. I liked the Old Crow, I loved the New Crow. I liked Dr. Forseter, the other Dr. who lasted 1 year and TV's Frank, I loved Brain Guy, Bobo and Pearl. Basically, I thought the show got better as it went along. So already, I am glad there are 3 Mike Eps and only 1 Joel in this collection... while Joel is good, he's a little too dry and laid back for me.
I think the history of MST featurette (split over the first 3 discs since its at least an hour) is worth the price of admission alone and have been throughly enjoying that.
But, the real selling point for me for this collection is Werewolf (or as the closing copyright calls it Arizona Werewolf) this is my 2nd all time favorite Ep. (behind The Final Sacrifice and ahead of Manos: Hands of Fate). I have been waiting for this release since Rhino started releaseing the collection. I even wrote to them and suggested releasing it along with Track of the Moon Beast, the Bats one and the Brain that Wouldn't Die with a theme of people transforming into creatures... they didn't go for it though.
Anyway, so far the Joel Ep (First Spaceship to Venus) was nyeh... nothing great, but not terrible for a Joel Ep.  The story is so astronimically bad, and the actors such a hodgepodge of different nationalities its tough to really get into.
The 2nd Ep. (Laserblast) was the final Comedy Central Ep. so I think it is a good choice for sort of a ""history of"" release... They could have gone with Mitchell since it was Joel's last Ep. but I think Rhino has the rights to that one. Again, story bad enough, acting bad enough and the MST treatment just right. I especially like the Host Segments sicne they did a good job sorta wrapping up what could have been the last episode.
The 3rd Ep is Werewolf.... What can I say about that one except I can watch it a million times and not get sick of it. I mean the security guard contoinues to drive his car while transforming into a Werewolf... don't you think he would pull over at some point????? classic.
The final Ep is Future War which is from Season 10 (I think) and based on my prior statement of thinking the show got funnier as it went along, I really enjoyed this one too. THe JCVD rip off guy does his best, but holding rubber dinosaurs in front of the camera for forced perspective special effects is too much to overcome, unless you are wathicng it with Mike and the Bots. Which you are, so enjoy.

This Limited Edition has already been discontinued by Shout Factory, so I'm not sure how useful my review would be except if you can get if off e-bay or something.  I mean the crow robot in the box is o.k., the ""movie posters"" are decent but the tin box is too big and the CONTENT of the movies is the true selling point. No matter what version you get this edition in, just get it.

1246466,5,B00001U0DT,"I thought this was an incredible set - here is my thoughts of all the movie episodes
First Spaceship on Venus (show 211) - well according to the Amazing Colossal Movie Guide written by the MST3K crew say this wasn't their best work. And they're right, its not that good, but you know what, this isn't really that bad either. The segments with the robot who speaks in foam is good & Tom acting really sarcastic was something to behold. I personally felt this wasn't the best episode to use for people wanting to see Joel for the first time or for a Joel representation of a 20th Anniversary set. The movie is a little tough to get through if you watch it at the wrong time. You really need to be in the mood to watch a lower budget science fiction episode. Joel has a great line ""a million pounds of doodie"" during a fun scene where the astronauts are being chased by something gooey. Tom has a great T shirt line with a man with a T shirt ""Hes wearing a Tshirt"" .It might be a weaker Joel show, but its still worth seeing and you might want to watch it when the mood to watch this movie strikes you. Some movies you really have to be in the mood to watch first, this is one of them. it was made as a serious scifi movie with a multi cultural cast..
Laserblast (show 706) was the last episode to hit the Comedy Central era. This is one of those Charles Band low budget movies. The jokes and segments are really good especially the 2001 spoof ending. This is the end of an era as Trace B (Crow and Dr F) left the show after this never to return. Pearl Forrester's character underwent a huge change for the better after this. This is a very good key episode. Mike dressed as a woman is always a sight to behold. The movie itself isn't that good (hence its an MST3K episode) but the creatures that were created by Dave Allen are neat, if nothing else. It can drag at time. If you haven't seen this, here is a chance to see one of a handful of eventful/key episodes that changed the course of history of MST3K. Somewhat hard to get through the movie, but its a key episode, and very enjoyable for the most part. Not to be missed for fans of the show.
Werewolf (show 904) This is a great scifi channel episode. Bad Werewolf movie (gore and other violence were cut for the show) but really a fun bad movie to watch, it has some good/decent horror elements, but not great werewolves, pretty much considered lame looking. The acting is horrible especially the blond lady who can not pronounce 'werewolf'. The riffling on this movie is great, and the segments on this are superb too. Mike as a girl again (2 of the episodes in this set has Mike as a girl) singing a 1950s style song is so very disturbing. A very popular Mike on the scifi channel episode and it will not disappoint. One of my favorites from the scifi era, as well as a favorite from many MST3K fans around the world. Watch it and see why it is a popular episode on this set.
Future War (show 1004)- a Jean Claude Van Dam wannabe fighting 6 ft tall dinosaurs and a terrible script. Bad effects bad acting, great riffling - this is a very popular episode. I liked the dinos but why they were man sized is beyond me..still it is fun to get through and was one of their most modern B movies they ever did.
This set with the crow robot/tin/lobby cards is out of print, so if you still want to get this, hurry up or its going to cost you 100.00 or more online
I cant wait for the next Volume - V. 14 with Mad Monster,Manhunt in Space,Soultaker and Final Justice - coming in Feb 09",1228089600,4,3531,4.2171344165435745
1246467,5,B00001U0DT,"I am overall pleased with this product.  I thought it was a great design and the disk artwork was really nice, but made the included lobby cards redundent.  The only major complaint I have was the difficulty in opening the tin for the first time.  The back lid was so tight I practically had to pry it off and when I did so, I cut a finger pretty deep.  I think this can be attributed to the fact that my copy was slightly dented when it arrived, which made the box hard to open.  I loved the Crow figurine and hope that Shout! decided to release a Servo one as well.  Crow looks loney on my tv by himself.",1228003200,,606,4.050420168067227
1246468,5,B00001U0DT,"This set is apparently the DVD-only version of the 20th Anniversary set from Shout Factory. That means that it does not include the tin case, plastic Crow figurine or episode lobby cards. It does contain four great episodes of everyone's favorite cow-town puppet show.

This set features one episode with Joel Hodgson as host and three with Mike Nelson hosting. Two episodes are from the Comedy Central years while two are from the Sci-Fi Channel shows.

211- First Spaceship on Venus
Originally called Der Schweigende Stern and made in 1960, this international cast film about the first astronauts to land on Venus is a hoot. Filled with wonderful ideas about international cooperation, yet strangely dated in its science even for when it was made, this movie's vision of the future is fun, action-filled and nearly breaks the goofy meter! The jokes are endless, non-stop and really top-notch from the MST3K crew. ""What's a herring weigh? Oh, about a pound."" ""Everything's better in the crawler copter."" Just the endless jokes about the robot in the film, Omega, will keep you laughing throughout. The host segments are just awesomely funny. When the planet has it's ""brown explosion"" near the end you'll be rolling with laughter and the jokes fly really fast at that point. This is a sometimes overlooked, underrated classic that is too funny to describe. I love it and never get tired of watching it no matter how many times I see it.

706- Laserblast
This 1978 feature comprises the final episode from Comedy Central and is an odd little feature that received 2.5 stars from Leonard Maltin, a fact that is the source of endless wonderful wisecracks as the credits roll. Hilarious throughout in spite of the fact that everyone working on the show knew it might be their last one ever. The host segment wrap-up with great 2001: A Space Odyssey references is terrific.

904- Werewolf
This 1996 feature with Richard Lynch is even more ridiculous than most stories based on lycanthropy. The goofy meter breaks in the first reel of this film and never gets repaired. An archaeologist gets cut by the skeleton of a werewolf and so, predictably, becomes one. The acting, bad foreign accents, and other low-budget silliness in this film are hammered mercilessly by MST3K. The host segment where Mike and the 'Bots are a girl group singing a teen tragedy song, a sort of like ""Leader of the Pack"" type number, is absolutely killer funny.

1004- Future War
This 1997 video feature is so bad it is beyond words. The huge headed Robert Zdar appears in his second film done on MST3K (the other was Soultaker) and his acting is just as stiff as in the other movie. The film features terrible looking rubber dinosaurs, mediocre martial arts-style action sequences, a hackneyed formulaic plot and acting so bland that calling it wooden would be a compliment! Fortunately, it has enough movement and scene changes to at least fuel a barrage of great jokes from MST3K. It's fun, but only thanks to the MST3K treatment. By itself, this film would be unwatchable.

The extra features on the DVD discs include the 3-part history of MST3K and a video of the reunion panel from Comic-Con 2008. These are very informative and entertaining, even for long-time fans. Great stuff all around.",1227484800,74,3267,4.877477477477478
1246469,5,B00001U0DT,"Amazing. Love the little crow that is included and the small poster cards along with the tin ""lunch box"" styled container that it all comes in.

1246471,5,B00001U0DT,"The ""Mystery Science Theater 3,000: 20th Anniversary Edition (Limited Edition)"" set is quite a good buy!

It also comes with four limited-edition lobby-cards [for each episode], and a Crow T. Robot figurine, all in a great tin case (that could double for a lunch-box!)!  It also has more special features than on any ""MST3k"" DVD before it; There is a 3-part ""MST3k"" documentary, a featurette on the various musical-intros to ""MST3k"" (!), trailers to all of the movies, and a short-film about the 2008 San Diego ComicCon!

I am more of a fan of Mike so I like that fact that there are 3 episodes featuring Mike ( Laserblast, Werewolf and Future War) and one episode with Joel ( First Spaceship to Venus). Of the four my favorite is Werewolf because of the cheesy acting and the random foreign accent of the main female character ( Paul is you a Verevolf??). Laserblast is also really funny because of the two policemen who try to go after the main chracter. Highly reccommend you will not be sorry!",1226707200,,561,4.352380952380952
1246475,5,B00001U0DT,"It is hard to describe MST3K, witty, funny, downright odd, and who was that fat chick anyways, other than the series bad person super stalking weirdo. The premise was insane, the characters campy, the acting horrific, the brain zombie guy just as weird as a minion regardless of side that he played. That was the charm of the whole thing though and what made MST3K the awesome series that it was. Bad science fiction movies, with a bad premise, with bad acting, bad robots, bad exile to a floating space station and an almost inhumanly zany human to go along with it, it could not fail.

These disks will help you rediscover the insanity of the MST3K universe, meaning you want to watch this on a Sunday afternoon, and try to annoy the kids with them. So what is on the disks?

First Spaceship on Venus from 1960, as bad as they come
Laserblast from 1978, that was actually somewhat entertaining.
Werewolf from 1996 almost as bad as the first spaceship on Venus
Future War from 1997, it is scary to think that this movie was made

The disks also have Joel Hodgson and Mike Nelson as hosts, so you can see the old and the new with this disk set. Overall, you are going to get all the bad you can possibly take in the afternoon. Well worth watching, well worth hunting down, and entirely entertaining. Good for causing major rifts between family members if put in during critical times when something else might be on the TV.",1226275200,,1423,4.486486486486487

But the diehards need to be aware of the `History of MST3K' documentary, spread over the first three DVDs' bonus feature sections. It's primarily recent talking head interview footage from virtually all of the primary forces behind the show, including Jim Mallon and even Josh Weinstein. Bits of vintage behind the scenes footage pops up now and again. Each of the three segments is close to 30 minutes long, so in effect what you get is a very encompassing and fairly detailed full documentary somewhere between an hour to 90 minutes long. I almost wish it was on its own separate disc so that it could be watched in its entirety without having to switch discs.

I love the lengthy History of MST3k and the Comic-Con Q&A. The really cool part was that it has all of the openings from the series. The only thing I didn't like was that the History of MST3K is broken into three parts on three discs. I would have liked it better to have been all together, that way I won't have to switch discs to see parts 1 2 3 when I just want to watch the History.

you already know the movies & how laserblast is considered one of the best mst3k episodes like, EVER.  so i won't go on about it.

the canister's paint job is spot on, the art for the individual dvds is really beautiful & brings out the whole ""fresh paint on a broken down chevy"" feeling you get watching joel/mike & the bots have fun.

there isn't much room for the actual dvd set to fit inside of the tin, i could barely get it in & the person at the factory who initially did so dog-eared the internal box.  no big deal.  the crow figurine is a little smaller than i thought it'd be & i'm hoping they release a complete set of these some day.  i'm worried about scratching the paint job & i'm going to put this away until i have some place to display it along with my mst3k the movie laserdisc, first run DVD & my complete dvd set.

1246484,5,B00001U0DT,"I know three of these MST3K eps well: Wurrrrwilf and its Uzbekistani cast, as well as Laserblast (starring the immortal Eddie Deezen) and Future War (starring Jean-Claude Gosh Darn). First Spaceship on Venus I saw on MST3K a long, long time ago, but the riffing is dim in my memory.

However, First Spaceship on Venus was actually a groundbreaking Eastern Bloc (Polish, to be exact) film from 1959 that actually depicted a multi-ethnic spaceship crew - unheard of in the USA at the time - that stressed brotherhood. Of course, it was ""comrades"", but at least, for instance, the African-American character was completely stereotype free - save for the constant gesturing by the writing saying, ""Look! We have a black character and he's not oppressed! Hooray for the worker!"" Oy. The plot was cheesy, but not the cheese you'd find in other MST3K episodes.

The other three? There's less cheese in all of Wisconsin, Vermont, France and the Netherlands. Wurrrrrrwilf is the most recent movie MST3K ever did (1996), and featured an all thickly-accented Italian cast, with the director making a cameo as a Sicilian rent-a-cop who decides to drive like a Kennedy. Laserblast features Eddie Deezen, some good stop-motion animated turtle aliens who are completely out of place in the film, and a kid who wishes he were at a nudist colony to show off his 1970's scrawny torso. The sign off of the Comedy Central era show wasn't half as good as the Sci-Fi Network finale, though. Transforming into balls of light wasn't nearly as poignant as the trio sitting down into a baseman studio apartment and watching The Crawling Eye. And finally, Future War, a movie that is so cheaply made, you can tell it was a demo reel for Daniel Bernhardt so he could audition for the Bloodsport sequels and the live action Mortal Kombat series - he literally was the guy you called when Jean-Claude Van Damme wasn't available. MST3K favorite Robert Z'Dar appears in it as well.

The interviews look great - can't wait to see them. The Crow tchotchke is nice, and the lobby cards don't seem to be anything special. I do love the new artwork on each DVD, though.",1224892800,,2132,4.788043478260869

7914797,5,B00001U0DT,".
This review is of the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: 20th ANNIVERSARY compilation.  The four movies up for heckling vary widely in quality and theme:
.
.
FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS (MST3K Episode 211, movie released 1960): This East German-Polish co-production tries hard, but errs more toward seriousness than entertainment. After finding a Venusian artifact on earth, a multinational cast fly to Venus to see what's what. It isn't all bad -- enroute, there's a Roomba-sized robot that plays chess against a dimwitted crew member -- but generally it's a little dull despite middling-good special effects for the turn of the Sixties. It does have nice things to say about international cooperation and fear of nuclear proliferation.  However, Joel and the bots are not at their best here, if only because the movie itself is neither silly nor ludicrous.  My favorite host segment featured Tom Servo with his ""sarcasm sequencer"" out of whack.
.
.
LASERBLAST (Episode 706, 1978):  Despite the presence of veterans Keenan Wynn and Roddy McDowall in small roles, this turkey undoubtedly sent the career of the late Kim Milford as lead character ""Billy Duncan"" into a tailspin, in a performance derided as ""greasy"" and ""pop-eyed"" by the SOL crew. (The supporting cast mostly consisted of versatile ""B"" veterans like Ron Masak, Dennis Burkley and Eddie Deezen, the Arnold Stang of the Seventies.)  Premise:  Young man stumbles across a powerful laser blaster, but reptilian aliens want it back.  (What could go wrong?)  LASERBLAST is a great example of a cheesy sci-fi flick redeemed by heavy and funny riffing.  Regarding the film itself, the SOL crew had this to say:
.
-- On the fluctuating production values: Oh no, his car turned into a sedan (it had been a station wagon) and crashed and exploded.
-- On lack of tone: I think they were going for A Touch of Evil feel, but got a touch of something else.
-- On lack of suspense: This film was run through a highly technical process called tension extraction.
.
Among the many other references, watch out for a big bunch of 1970s music-group riffs.  A witty host segment, alluding to Trace Beaulieu's last appearance on the show, has him in a parody of the closing sequences of the movie 2001.  For extra fun, devise a drinking game based on the numerous times characters in the film head for a Coke (always Coke) machine.  One of the best Mistie episodes, IMO.
PS: Yes, film critic Leonard Maltin really did give this movie two-and-a-half stars (""David Allen's stop-motion effects are a highlight""), the same as for MY DINNER WITH ANDRE(!) and THE GREAT SANTINI(!!).
.
.
WEREWOLF (Episode 904, 1995): a direct-to-video production: allegedly a horror movie but more like a horror of a movie. Somewhere in the American Southwest, in an outdoor sugar mine next to a Tiramisu excavation (per the SOL crew), an unusual skeleton is exhumed, which turns out to be a werewolf. The rest of the movie is basically a round-the-rosy of lycanthropy, but so deeply schlocky that it makes for great riffing by Mike and the bots. The female lead cannot pronounce the word werewolf correctly; each time she tries its a little different but always wrong. (Mike accuses her of having learned English from a wild and crazy guy). When she says: I don't know what to believe, Servo advises Try believing in ESL for a while. Night cinematography is done by Haskell Wexlers . . . cat. Wolf transformation scenes usually involve extra hair glued to the actors cheeks, later a bear mask(!) or a bat puppet(!!). Expect full-service riffing from our guys, starting with the pseudo-Native American chants which they call Jingle Bells sung by the Bulgarian Womens Choir; ending with various American popular songs sung/chanted to the rhythm of Fleetwood Macs Tusk. I consider this one of the very best MSTs, on a par with such beloved send-ups as MANOS, SPACE MUTINY and I ACCUSE MY PARENTS. With Joe Estevez.
.
.
FUTURE WAR (episode 1004, film made 1994, released 1997):  Crow was right:  You know, I could point out that its not the future, and there isn't a war, but you know me; I don't like to complain.  This movie makes no sense, and it is so bad that words fail me. Sheesh. Its as though the makers of this movie went out of their way to violate realism, even when they didn't have to. Note that the movie was given the video equivalent of an R rating and you can see the nuns speech being blipped in early scenes. Are potty-mouthed nuns a problem in your life? I didn't think so. On the whole, FUTURE WAR is deeply cheap and almost plotless -- plastic-looking dinosaurs attacking humans is about all it amounts to. If you can make it past the first scene of people tossing around obviously empty cardboard boxes as though they had something inside -- well, bless you, I almost stopped there. Mike and the bots try their best but they are obviously as nonplussed as anyone else with this insultingly lame movie.  Id give the movie alone two stars only because its in color and I heard all the words. The Mistie treatment did improve it, in my opinion, just not enough to put it in the top echelon of MST3K episodes.
.
.
Unlike some Shout! releases, this set does not come in a tin box, just a cardboard wraparound.  It does have the miniposters, though, and a nice little doc starring Mistie principals about the history and production of the show, one chapter per disc in succession.  My original reviews ranked these four movies 4, 5, 5, and 4 respectively.  I'll ooch that up to five stars here, because the new, improved price makes the set affordable.  For once, though, all these movies are currently available as Amazon downloads (unlike many compilations, it doesn't have that one frustrating episode that can't be found otherwise through Amazon), so the purchasing decision may be a judgment call on your part.  Meanwhile, dim the lights, and get Mike to whip up some Jiffy-Pop!
