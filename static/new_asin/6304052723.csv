769217,5,6304052723,"I've never seen the original, but this TV version was truly mezmerizing.  I love Jessica Lange so I am biased when it comes to her performances.  However, I had such compassion for her portrayal of Blanche.  She portrays the character as such a lost and troubled soul.  You feel a sence of impending doom building throughout the film which is satisfied by the film's explosive climax.  The entire cast is first-rate and seem to compliment each other's performance.

769514,5,6304052723,"the only thing this production lacks is marlon brando as stanley.  although that is a formidable handicap, this is,nonetheless a stellar,interpretation. jessica lange is incredible and gives it nuances that vivien leigh was unable to because of censorship issues of the day.  i have always loved leigh's blanche but i equally love lange's blanche.  and is is Blanche's story, how as a hot house flower of the vanquished South, she is no match for the predatory husband of her sister.  with over half of an hour of material added from the original play, i understand Blanche a lot better.  alec baldwin gives it his best shot in the brando role as the brutish but sensual husband.  i can't imagine anyone else doing it better but it is a thankless job to take on a brando part.  on balance though, i am so glad to have finally seen the play in its entirety.  you owe it to yourself to see both versions.  it is the best of the American stage.

769516,3,6304052723,"I have seen all 3 versions .  No one as of yet can replace Brando in the part of Stanley, but I look forward to someone trying.

Of the 3 Blanches, I believe really Ann-Margret was Blanche. I thought Jessica Lange had the potential to be the best Blanche but she did not get anywhere near Ann-Margret's portrayal of Blanche.

 I felt Alec Baldwin's acting left a lot to be desired. The long shadow of Brando makes if difficult to recreate Stanley. Even Treat Williams portrayal was better than Baldwin's.

I am looking forward to the next remake.  Since Brando has passed on, maybe someone can truly recreate Stanley for a new generation.

 John Goodwin was just wrong for this part.  The wife paled compared to Beverly De'Angelo ( with Ann-Margret). I wish I could find Ann-Margret and treat Williams version on DVD for the USA -  so far all I have is the awful VHS.",1383091200,,867,4.5

769519,5,6304052723,"As a homosexual male born in 1955 I don't see how I could be more invested in the original film version of this magnificent play.  I was pretty much raised on it.  The films of Tennessee Williams plays were about the only cultural containers that I had to project into during my youth.  But, I am so glad that I bought this particular filmed version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""  How often do you get to watch performances this brilliantly filmed which are the result of this degree of preparation, development, and performance experience and largess.  Which can pretty much only come from a successful long-run Broadway production.  Don't be confused that this might be one of those awkwardly filmed theatre productions for television.  I am not sure I have ever seen a film of a play that is this cinematically successful.  The very generous use of close-up allows us to appreciate just how rich, nuanced and fully realized these performances are.  I had alway heard that Ms. Lange was miscast for this role.  I don't know, this seems to me to be an absolutely bravura performance which vastly deepened my understanding of a character which I thought I knew quite well.  Of course it does help, a lot, that we are finally able to watch the actual original play, and I am not sure we all appreciate just how long this took.  Nor why.  Mr. Baldwin's excellent performance has considerable range and hits all the right ""Stanley"" notes and moments and the potential for violence feels very palpable.  But for some reason I kept thinking that the actor was perhaps a bit too middle class for the performance to be absolutely believable.  I may have just been resistant and you should decide for yourself.  All the supporting actors give commendable fulfilling performances.  But, the best part of this film is that the psycho-emotional logic and development of the play is so completely there and so satisfying.  It, finally, all makes so much sense.  And the shear dramatic intensity of the playwright's work and accomplishment is thrilling.  No matter how much you love the original film of this play I can't imagine anyone being the least bit disappointed that they purchased this DVD.  Not if you like Tennessee Williams.",1360886400,8,2224,4.8153034300791555

769523,3,6304052723,"At least Glen Jordan, the director, was working with a script much closer to the stage version than the expurgated Warner Bros. film.  And somewhere in the libraries of remakes is the Anne Margaret/Treat Williams version.

Okay, for this version....John Goodman's Mitch brings a sweetness and a pain to the screen that is almost physically uncomfortable to watch, it is so naked and vulnerable.

Let's face it....no one is ever going to make Stanley their own....it's been done.  It's owned.  I find that Alec Baldwin has grown in the years he's been working, into a wonderfully adept comedian, as well as honoring his dramatic abilities.  His anger and frustration was, for me, too cerebral....Stanley IS a primal man.  It's hard for an intelligent actor to make us believe that he isn't smart.  It really showed me the difference between acting and being, looking at Brando.

However, it cases like this, where Stanley doesn't overwhelm the screen (or stage) it allows Blanche to take her rightful place in the spotlight, stage center.  And that's why when this version was first aired I thought that we'd found a new Blanche for the ages.  And in many ways, we have.  My only question, complaint, disappointment came with Ms. Lange's adoption of every note, every nuance, every breath of Vivien Leigh's vocal performance. I thought it was my imagination, since that's the performance I've seen and heard so many times.  But now, watching it again, I had the same experience.

Stella is definitely worth Stanley's attention, and Blanche's devotion, and her physical inability to believe her husband's cruelty reminded me of another piece of acting that Ms. Lane accomplished in UNFAITHFUL....the ability she has of showing the audience what is going on in her mind and in her gut....if you missed her performance, especially the train ride the morning after her first tryst in UNFAITHFUL, then you have missed a performance that shows what acting is all about.

Maybe we say there are definitive performances because we have film to back up the brouhaha....but you can only hear people talk about Jessica Tandy on Broadway, bringing Blanche to life....we'll never know, only words to remind us.

I enjoyed the film, do not find anything to rave about.  Glad I have a pastel picture to go along with the black and white but the color was always there.  Why look for more?  But then.....who knows.....",1317081600,8,2401,4.9575
769623,5,6304052723,"Jessica Lange is flawless as Blanche!  It's like Vivian Leigh's spirit entered her body when she played this role.  No wonder she won a Golden Globe!  Diane Lane and Alec Baldwin are great, as usual, only John Goodman seems mis-cast as Mitch.  Excellent adaptation of Tennesse William's play!!",1316563200,2,293,5.041666666666667
769624,5,6304052723,Some very strong performances.  This version is much more consistent with the text than the Brando version.  My only complaint is that it has poor menu screen/chapter options.,1316131200,,175,5.214285714285714
769625,4,6304052723,"Tennessee Williams is one of America's greatest playwrights, and 1947's Putlizer-Prize winning ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is his undisputed masterpiece. Sam Staggs, in his definitive history of ""Streetcar"", correctly describes the play as ""a root canal on the soul.""
  The plot concerns Blanche DuBois, who arrives in New Orleans seeking refuge from her troubled past in her sister Stella's small apartment. Blanche hadn't counted on her brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski, being so brutish and intensely sexual, however. She hopes to find a measure of happiness and  peace with Stanley's friend Harold Mitchell (Mitch). A lesser playwright than Williams may well have given Blanche, and the audience, a happy ending with Mitch. But neither Williams nor his characters are that easy or simplistic. His characters are not all good or all bad. They exist in a morally gray area; with Williams exposing the cruel and harsh realities of life.  When the truth of Blanche's sordid past is crudely and relentlessly exposed by Stanley, Mitch cruelly rejects her. Blanche loses her tenuous grip on reality. There is a final violent confrontation between Blanche and Stanley; which in turns leads to one of the most soul-shattering conclusions in theatre history.
  The cast of this 1995 TV production, based on a successful Broadway revival starring Jessica Lange and Alec Baldwin,  does not have to contend with the censorship issues that plagued the otherwise outstanding 1951 film version. So here we have the full text and content of Williams' original play. This means we get the sad story of the suicide of Blanche's gay husband, and we see how it has haunted her for years. We also get the full, long scene between Blanche and Stella following the violent poker game.  This 1995 production drips with the potent sexuality that was fairly muted in the 1951 film version. We also see, perhaps for the first time, how Stella is torn between her sisterly love and devotion to Blanche, and her powerful sexual attraction to Stanley.
  I prefer Tennessee Williams' plays in black and white. This production is in color. Between 1951 and 1995, another TV version starring Ann-Margaret (1984; which, to my knowledge, has never been available on DVD) was shot in a strange sort of color. It looked like it was shot with an orange-colored filter on the camera lens. At any rate, the 1984 version is too rushed. This 1995 production shows great respect for the play. At  Two hours, thirty six minutes, it is virtually the entire play; running thirty six minutes longer than the 1951 film version. And the color photography is fine.
  While nothing will ever erase the impact of the outstanding cast of Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden in 1951, most of this cast is up to the challenge  of presenting this full-force,  complete and uncensored ""Streetcar."" Diane Lane and John Goodman are excellent as Stella and Mitch. If Vivien Leigh is the ""definitive Blanche"", then surely Jessica Lange deserves to be acclaimed as the ""second definitive Blanche.""  Like Viven Leigh, Jessica Lange gives  a tour-de-force, devastating, heartwretching performance.  Leigh and Lange's performances should never be compared, because both performances are equal in terms of interpretation  and emotional impact. Dramatic inequality is more evident if one compares Marlon Brando and Alec Baldwin as Stanley. To be fair, Baldwin turns his own performance down and never attempts to copy Brando. How in the world could he? Marlon Brando was a dangerous, dynamic, sexual force of nature as Stanley. Alec Baldwin, simply, is not.
  The genius of Tennessee Williams and the power of  ""A Stretcar Named Desire"" remains undiminished. Aficionados should own both the 1951 and 1995 productions. Both productions will provide a full-force emotional catharsis. I was crying uncontrollably during the final scene.",1302480000,14,3889,5.178913738019169
769626,5,6304052723,"Oscar winner Jessica Lange took on one of the hardest roles any actress can portray, that of Blanche DuBois from Tennessee William's ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" on broadway. Her co-star was sexy Alec Baldwin who portrays the rough and gruff Stanley. Both would reprise their roles for a well-adapted television movie that aired on CBS in the fall of 1995, making this one of the last made-for-TV movies on network television due to the high cost of producing teleplays.

 Although I don't believe Lange's performance is the best (that distinction belongs to Ann-Margret who played the role in 1984), but Lange does bring her own personality to Blance. She brings more of a softness and child-like quality whereas both Ann-Margret and Vivien Leigh (in the original 1950's version) had a bit of toughness and harshness in their performances. I also love Alec Baldwin in this: he has his own interpretation of Stanley and his sexiness is evident especially in the rape scene (who can forget the moment when he tears his shirt open and exposes that amazing hairy chest!).

 The supporting roles are played by Oscar nominee Diane Lane (most famous for her role in ""Unfaithful"") and John Goodman.

 Critics call this version ""...As gorgeous and atmospheric as it gets..."".",1302220800,2,1265,5.0
769627,4,6304052723,Some movies shouldn't be touch. But hollywood did a good job with this film. Jessica Lange did a great job as the half dim-witted sister Blanche Dubois. I loved it.,1282780800,,164,4.5
769628,5,6304052723,"Many are familiar with the classic film adaptation of this masterpiece play. However, the classic made changes to the screenplay written by Gore Vidal, to appease the censors.

769629,2,6304052723,"I bought this tape due to the rave reviews it received and because I loved the original and also loved the remake with Treat Williams and Ann Margaret.  I thought with an exceptional cast, such as this one that this film couldn't miss.  I'll probably be lynched because I am the only one here to give it a poor review.  I am an enormous fan of Alec Baldwin and have never been able to find fault with his performance in anything he has ever done, until I saw this movie.  Today he would be a better, stronger, more believable Stanley Kowalski than he was at the height of his beauty, though at this point in time, his age would not fit the character.  Much as I like Jessica Lange, at one point I had to turn off the movie because I simply couldn't listen to her anymore.  I found her performance to be overacted and hammy. My vhs tape had not been rewound and was in the middle when I received it: I suspect whoever had it before I did also turned it off at this point. Wonderful John Goodman was hopelessly miscast and unbelievable as Mitch. Alec Baldwin, Jessica Lange, Diane Lane, John Goodman, Tennessee Williams, how could you possibly go wrong with this cast and writing, but somehow it was mangled.  I did go back and finally finish the film, and have to say the second half was better than the first, but the entire production left me underwhelmed. I am aware that art is in the eye of the beholder and to each his own, but found the acting and direction so deeply flawed that it literally rendered this film unwatchable.",1229990400,3,1530,4.366197183098592
769630,4,6304052723,"This lavish 1995 television remake of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is simply sublime.  Jessica Lange is perfect casting for the tour-de-force role of Blanche DuBois, and Tennessee Williams' play still packs a hell of a punch.

Blanche DuBois (Jessica Lange) goes to visit her sister Stella (Diane Lane) and her husband, boorish Stanley Kowalski (Alec Baldwin) one sultry summer in New Orleans.  Blanche lives in a world of her own creation to protect herself from the frightening, black gaping void of a hostile real world from which she simply cannot survive.  When Stanley discovers Blanche's weaknesses it's only a matter of time before she cracks completely.

Tennessee Williams' dramatic tale of the innocent and fragile being crushed by a hostile and cruel world is still amazingly relevant.  John Goodman turns in a heartbreaking performance as Mitch, the man who falls in love with Blanche but is too weak to fight for her.  Diane Lane is a knockout as Stella, Stanley's wife who'll stand by him whatever happens.  Alec Baldwin is all menace and smouldering sexuality as Stanley.

Jessica Lange, treading in the hallowed footsteps of Jessica Tandy, Uta Hagen and Vivien Leigh, is a vibrant and vital Blanche.  Completely enchanting and bubbly in her early scenes and then slowly letting the mask fall as the world around her becomes too raw and real.

This STREETCAR will completely break your heart.",1103587200,6,1404,5.060869565217391
769631,5,6304052723,"Perhaps I had lower expectations of this production since I have always been taken by the 1951 version of this Tennessee Williams classic with Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh. I couldn't imagine any performance by any actor competing with theirs. But in this version both Alec Baldwin and Jessica Lange distinguish themselves. Of course they are not Brando and Leigh but they don't have to be. Lange who is famous for playing disturbed women (FRANCES and BLUE SKIES) is quite good as the fragile, mentally wobbly Blanche. There are times when she has that scary, crazy look in her eyes that puts chills on your spine. While Baldwin is not quite as much of an animal as Brando, he certainly is believable as the rough and sexy Stanley. Nobody exhibits more anger on screen than Mr. Baldwin. John Goodman brings a gentleness to his role as Mitch that makes him just right for the guiles of Blanche.

This entire production holds up well against the original with one exception. While I appreciate the additions that were omitted from the 1951 production-- we can speak about homosexuality now when even the Vice President of the United States talks about his gay daughter-- this version, however, is close to being too long. By the time the movie ended, I was ready for Blanche-- in what must be one of the saddest scenes in film-- to leave and make her famous statement about the kindness of strangers.",1096675200,7,1400,4.737704918032787
769632,5,6304052723,"I was age two in 1951 when Tennessee Williams's A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE had its first Silver Screen incarnation. I don't recall seeing this film during the 50s as part of a twenty-five cent, Saturday, kiddy matinee double feature. Well, we would have been bored with such grown-up tempests-in-a-teapot anyway. As an adult, I can now view both the original and this 1995 version, and reap the benefit of improved film-making technology and relaxed censorship, though both versions are substantively identical - no surprise, since they're both working off the same script.
Blanche Dubois arrives in post-WWII New Orleans from Mississippi to visit her younger sister Stella, who's married to Stanley Kowalsky. Both women were the products of a genteel, Southern upbringing, and Blanche is appalled by Stanley's brutishness and the sweltering, seedy, French Quarter apartment in which her sister happily lives. Early in life, Blanche was psychologically devastated her young husband's death. He'd committed suicide after Blanche had discovered his homosexuality and confronted him. Stella having departed the family estate, Belle Reve, for the Big City, the widowed Blanche was left to deal with the deaths of parents and the eventual loss of Belle Reve to creditors. Now, at the edge of sanity, Blanche perceives herself as a classic Southern lady fallen on hard times. But she has another side which Stanley, a male ""pig"" if there ever was one, immediately perceives. It's their tense interaction over several months that provides the story's conflict and seals Blanche's fate.
How do the players compare?
Alec Baldwin's 1995 Stanley is more than adequate. OK, he doesn't have the animal presence of Marlon Brando's original, but at least the former doesn't talk as if through a mouthful of cotton. And if I hear the 1951 Stanley screech his high-pitched ""Stella!"" one more time, I'll lose it.
The role of Blanche is better served by Jessica Lange than Vivien Leigh. To me, Leigh's version came off with a touch of spoiled brat, while Lange's embodied more of the vulnerability and residual gentility that comprised the essence of Blanche. In that persona, Leigh's illusions and delusions seemed overacted, while Lange's seemed inherently genuine. (Do I suffer from being too infatuated with Jessica's role in TOOTSIE?)
John Goodman as Mitch, who becomes smitten with Stanley's sister-in-law, is more of a flawed-yet-sympathetic figure than was Karl Malden's original. Perhaps it's because Goodman's more massive physique contrasts better with his (initial) gentleness.
Played by Diane Lane (1995) and Kim Hunter (1951), Stella is a toss-up. I give Ms. Lane the nod simply because she's a superb, contemporary actress that I fondly recall from LONESOME DOVE and UNFAITHFUL.
Purists will rage, but if I had to recommend one version over another, it would be this one. Filmed in color, it provides more atmosphere and depth than the B&W original. And the viewer no longer has to cope with the early-1950s censorship that muddied dialog and scenes having to do with homosexuality, rape and nymphomania. This is a half-century later; let's move on for Chrissakes! After all, the ""classic"" story is Williams's original play. (Who knows? In 2050, a third screen edition may do it even better. Perhaps it'll be a holographic presentation.)
For me, the best scene in both is at the end when Blanche is gallantly treated like the lady she believes herself to be, and she poignantly remarks, ""Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers."" To get through life, we all do.",1050451200,29,3584,5.17039586919105
