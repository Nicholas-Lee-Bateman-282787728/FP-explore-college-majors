7683697,5,B01CIXVXXO,Can't give Vera a high enough score! Excellent.,1473120000,,47,5.0
7683698,5,B01CIXVXXO,The best British detective ever!,1472342400,,32,5.6
7683699,5,B01CIXVXXO,Vera stories so popular in our library. I finally am learning first hand how enjoyable she is.,1471651200,,94,4.588235294117647
7683700,5,B01CIXVXXO,"What can I say about Brenda Blethyn.  This series is incredible.  She gives everything she's got in every episode.  Vera is obsessed, reckless, selfish, spoiled and abusive, but she has got to get her killer.  She drinks too much, is sloppy in her appearance and is in poor health.  Her staff is terrified of her and she pushes them to the point of mutiny.  I loved this series and Brenda Blethyn is the best actress I have ever seen, bar none.",1470614400,,444,4.419753086419753
7683701,5,B01CIXVXXO,Excellent series.  Great episodes.  Must have a great set of writers because they keep you in suspense until the very end of each episode.  Brenda Blethyn and her supporting cast are all great.  Worth watching.,1469750400,,210,4.914285714285715
7683702,5,B01CIXVXXO,"Vera is pure genius, from her worn mac to her floppy rain hat. She solves unthinkable crimes and keeps her team on their toes with her sharp remarks and driven manner. Spending time with her is a real treat.",1469318400,,207,4.333333333333333
7683703,5,B01CIXVXXO,"The detective I've always wanted: middle aged, chunky, socially inept, lonely, and perfect. If you love Masterpiece Mystery shows like ""Prime Suspect,"" and ""Inspector Morse"" you will adore Vera.",1467676800,19,194,5.724137931034483
7683704,5,B01CIXVXXO,"For those who, somehow, have missed seeing this series, this review is a strong recommendation to order this whole set.  This is a super price for a great series.  I purchased each one for $30.00 + and I have  enjoyed each one.  But this price for all five is great.  I am waiting eagerly for Vera 6, which comes out soon.  The acting, the writing, the casting, the scenery -- especially the scenery of Northern England -- it just draws you in.  I have to use the closed captioning because the dialect can be tricky to understand.  But I love he sound of it, which is authentic to the region.  So, well, that is all I wanted to say.",1465862400,20,632,4.243697478991597
7683705,5,B01CIXVXXO,"DCI Vera Stanhope is rough, untidy, obsessed. She wears a Mackintosh & floppy hat. She's a female Contemporary Columbo. She's a determined murder sleuth, aging but tough enough, most days. Characters are adapted after Ann Cleeves mysteries. The Northumberland filming locale & settings are an enchanting backdrop, but crime riddled. Cases are as violent as the country is ruggedly beautiful. This One through Five set is perfect for the person beginning with Vera. At the time of this review, cost per episode calculates even cheaper than used copies. And so good, it certainly is worth owning on DVD for viewing multiple times.

Brenda Blethyn (Atonement, Pride & Prejudice) as Vera, convincingly leads the team. Forensics via Dr Marcus Summer (Kingsley Ben-Adir). DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison). DC Mark Edwards (Riley Jones). DC Bethany Whelan (Cush Jumbo). Strong acting and vivid drama in every episode.

7683737,4,B01CIXVXXO,"The series is one of the better UK  detective dramas (above Cracker, DCI Banks, and Rebus, but below Prime Suspect and Broadchurch).  The cases are reasonably interesting, and the cast is pretty talented.",1518048000,,204,5.151515151515151

7683745,5,B01CIXVXXO,"This is one of the very best detective procedural shows ever produced for television.  The writing is excellent, with considerable variation in type of mystery, situation, and location.  The acting is great, and the camera work is remarkably well done.  A series to be highly recommended.",1498348800,,288,5.217391304347826

7683782,1,B01CIXVXXO,"I love the series Vera. I got these for my birthday and could not wait to binge. The first DVD stuck and skipped and finally froze on the final 10 minutes. I guess I will never know how that one ends. The second DVD was worse.  The last time I had to return something UPS picked it up at my house. NO SUCH LUCK this time. I had to drive it to a drop off spot. There are no convenient ones in my area. I ended up driving it to a scary ""hell hole"" of a place with a drop box out front. Just an all around AWFUL experience. I hope my refund is taken care of promptly or I will be updating this. Vera the series gets 5 stars from me. These DVDs would get a zero if I could give them one. SO FRUSTRATING!!!!",1494374400,7,702,3.808219178082192
7683783,5,B01CIXVXXO,Love this series. She is so real and love her sarcasm. The cast is so good and as usual the British have done a great job.,1494028800,,122,3.730769230769231
7683784,5,B01CIXVXXO,"I had to have this collection.  I'm glad one that works on our electronic system is available.  I like this person.  Her clothes are for her comfort.  No high heels for her.  She can be soft or gruff depending on the situation.  For the way she interacts with people, one gets the impression of secrets about her life she doesn't want to share.",1491868800,2,344,4.380952380952381
7683785,5,B01CIXVXXO,I have enjoyed watching Vera on my Public station but having he series is so much better. You get such a feel for the characters watching the episodes as they were filmed and intended. Any one who has watched Vera and enjoyed it would appreciated owning the series. I will keep adding the seasons as they are released. Brenda Blethyn is a great actress and this is a great series Pets!,1490313600,,385,4.436619718309859
7683796,5,B01CIXVXXO,"DCI Vera Stanhope of Northumberland is my kind of detective. In this series 4, she has a new haircut, which is more akin to wind blown and the absence of a hairbrush. She dresses for warmth, not style, although her raincoat is fashionable, and her sturdy shoes look as if they are handmade. All this discussion of her sense or lack of style is necessary to get the full picture of this detective. She is someone you feel you can trust, however, you cannot pull the wool over her. She knows when you are lying. Vera is down to earth, dresses for warmth, eats when she can, drinks more often, and her life as a DCI is her life.

Brenda Blethyn plays Vera, and she is absolutely brilliant. She has the ability to transform herself into Vera, her actions, her speech and her essence demand respect. In this series we are privy to more information about Vera's childhood, as she relays bits and pieces to her DS Joe Ashworth, played by David Leon. Joe, has a young family and a beautiful wife who wants the best. This causes discomfort and dissension in the family, and this is prominent in seep real of the episodes.

Series 4 as usual provides the best in acting, writing and directing. The episodes are all new and reality driven. We can see this happening in any neighborhood. These episodes take place in Northumberland, the moors, the desolate places and the nicer neighborhoods. Vera has a cast of characters who are all put in their place, she wants them to work harder, do more, bring in the clues and help solve the crimes. In series 4, a new young pathologist arrives, and he brings some needed romance and mystery. I found this series 4 to be one of the best of the 4 series. I have read test a series 5 has been ordered, David Leon will not reprise his role, so, a new DS will be introduced. Looking forward.

Recommended. prisrob 03-14-17",1489449600,,1847,4.474777448071217
7683797,1,B01CIXVXXO,"I was very happy to receive this 5-season set of Vera.  I finished the first four seasons and was preparing to watch season five only to discover that when I opened season 5, the case was empty. Total ripoff!!!",1489104000,2,210,4.384615384615385

7683803,4,B01CIXVXXO,"I have grown to like this show and the stars.  The acting is very good and the scripts are well written.  Sometimes it gets deeper than I care for into the personal lives of the main characters but I fast forward through those parts.  In some series that is okay, even enjoyable, but not in this series.",1485475200,,303,4.280701754385965

7683828,5,B01CIXVXXO,"This is a wonderful mystery series.  Vera is a DCI with an attitude.  Her sergeant calls her 'Mussolini' and it fits.

If you like British murder mysteries, you will love this one...but make no mistake.  This is not 'Midsomer Murders' and the crimes are not presented 'tongue in cheek'.  These murders are sad and awful and the solutions are often heartbreaking.  If you are easily moved to tears, this isn't one you want to watch.

If, however, you love great acting, great writing, and really interesting puzzles, Vera is a great choice!",1482883200,10,539,4.793478260869565
7683829,5,B01CIXVXXO,"I purchased the Vera collection 1-5.  Disc #2, Set 5, was defective....loud noise beginning immediately after inserting disc.  Unusable.  Would appreciate a replacement disc.  Set 5, ""Old Wounds.  Thank you.",1481760000,2,207,5.766666666666667
7683830,4,B01CIXVXXO,"Like some other reviewers have posted, the scenery is stunning in these shows.  But the linguistics will have you looking at your co-viewers and saying, ""did you understand what they said,"" several times each show.  The longer you watch it, you kinda get used to it.  But, you can catch enough of the dialogue to keep up with the show.  Due to the language barrier, though, I won't be ordering further episodes.",1481500800,3,411,4.666666666666667
7683831,5,B01CIXVXXO,"I love British mysteries! This series was exceptional, real characters, Vera was brilliant but also very down to earth and believable as an ordinary person. Well worth the purchase price.",1481328000,,187,5.266666666666667
7683832,5,B01CIXVXXO,"This detective series is not as ""dark"" as some other detective stories.  The supporting cast is good and the plots unfold nicely",1481155200,,128,4.818181818181818
7683833,3,B01CIXVXXO,"A wonderful mystery, with numerous interesting plots and a great cast of co-stars, I must say that Vera herself is the downfall of this series. Had it not been for this pompous, secretive, manipulative, rude and bag-lady dressing police inspector, the series would have garnered 5 stars! I don't know if the author of he books had Vera looking/acting this way or if it was the director of the series or Ms. Blethyn herself that wanted her to look and act this way, I only know it was distracting to say the least. Yes I know she has some baggage, but all the characters do. For anybody familiar with the Inspector Lynley series (movies), saying that Vera makes DS Havers look like a clothing model will understand. And yes, I also know that clothes do not make the person (or series) good or bad, in this case it is very annoying.",1481155200,,830,4.503311258278146

7683850,5,B01CIXVXXO,"I bought the Vera boxed set, and when the supplemental season 6 came out, I had to have it also.  I have learned so much about the United Kingdom since I began watching all their detective stories, including Vera.  One common variable among all of the detectives seems to be that the people, especially the youth, of all ethnicities, have absolutely no respect for police officers.  In the US, anti-police sentiment is more confined to certain ethnic groups in city neighborhoods.  I wonder if that's because our police are armed.  Oh well.  Vera is a down to earth frumpy detective, and the plots are very interesting.  I highly recommend it.",1478131200,,643,4.790909090909091

8753162,5,B01CIXVXXO,"In the tradition of this style of mystery, the plot unfolds at a slow but steady pace. The stories are decidedly not action-packed, but they are interesting, and more about motivation and human fallacy than most mysteries. The slower pace fits the gorgeous but sometimes bleak, stony setting of Northumberland. Vera, grumpy, sloppy, uneasy around children and couples, and probably a full-blown alcoholic, is a surpringly relatable and comfortable detective. The more you watch, the more affection you feel for her (due entirely, I'm sure, to Brenda Blethyn's brilliant portrayal of her.) This series gets addictive, and is well worth watching.",1535846400,,644,5.3861386138613865
