7339081,5,B011MU9ZIY,"Great show!!!!  The acting is SUPERB by all three primary actors playing Uncle Martian, Tim O'Hara, and Mrs. Brown.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES!",1458518400,,149,5.166666666666667
7339082,5,B011MU9ZIY,"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""My Favorite Martian"" was one of those series. Ray Walston played Uncle Martin, referred to in the credits as the Martian. He is an exoanthropologist from Mars, whose one-man spaceship crashes near Los Angeles. He is slightly injured, but his spaceship is badly damaged, stranding him here on Earth. The spectacular crash is witnessed by Tim O'Hara (Bill Bixby), a newspaper reporter for The Los Angeles Sun. Tim takes the extraterrestrial alien home with him, and passes his off as his Uncle Martin. Under the cover of darkness, the damaged spaceship is put in the garage under their apartment, and locked up for safekeeping. With their busybody landlady Mrs. Lorelei Brown (Pamela Britton) living next to them, and her boyfriend Bill Brennan (Alan Hewitt) being a police detective, keeping Uncle Martin's true identity a secret is a real challenge.

Being a Martian, Uncle Martin has special powers. He is able to raise antennas on his head, and become invisible. He is able to levitate objects with his finger, although the strings holding the objects are visible sometimes. Uncle Martin is also an inventor, whose inventions include a time machine, a duplicator, and a personality changer. The first two seasons were filmed in black and white, while the third season was in color. The audio and video qualities of the episodes are very well done. The episodes in the third season became even more far-fetched, beginning and ending with time-travelling episodes. As you may have surmised from that, Uncle Martin does not fly back to Mars in the last episode. That's just as well, since I like to think that Uncle Martin has remained on Earth all this time, at least in my fond memories. Each season has special bonus features, including Ray Walston's appearance on ""I've Got A Secret"" with Steve Allen, behind-the-scene home movies, and interviews with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston. It's obvious from the bonus features that the cast had great chemistry together, and genuinely liked each other.",1458086400,8,2129,5.0141242937853105
7339083,5,B011MU9ZIY,Great watch funny. No every show is  in color. But they only used one side. The DID NOT CHEAP OUT and put show on both sides of tape. That get the show 5 stars. Hope other will let us know when only use one side for show. They only put show on one side of disc.. Keep this up.,1454889600,2,276,3.6779661016949152

7339085,5,B011MU9ZIY,"I participate in a podcast and was sent a review copy in exchange for an honest review.  Seeing there were very few reviews here on Amazon I thought I'd go ahead an add another.

I am VERY happy with the quality of the DVD set, and the bonus features were, to my way of thinking, excellent.  I would have been a bit happier with the soundtrack if it was on a separate CD instead of being included on one of the DVDs, but as something you can play on your computer while you are working, or in the same room, the music from ""My Favorite Martian"" puts a smile on my face time and again.

The home movies, shot by some of the actors, on set, and narrated by one of the crew members, were another high light.  Showing filming locations, other actors like Robert Clary they bumped into when ""out on location"", a behind the scenes glimpse of the lion roaming around in season 3... the screen tests from when they were switching to color from black and white.  It was a special behind the scenes glimpse that gave a nice view of how these actors were very clearly having fun, and were genuine friends off camera as well.

The interviews from the time were also interesting, hearing Ray Walston talk about what drew him to the part, and the aspects he was enjoying was another highlight.

I watched these episodes in my youth, and they were engaging and entertaining to a child, keeping me laughing hysterically, and I suspect teaching me a bit of my sense of humor.  However, as an adult, not only were they both funny and entertaining, but I saw more depth and social commentary in them than I ever could have fathomed their containing when I was 10 and under.  Having viewed them before the concepts of McCarthyism or the Red-Scare and the black-list had been taught to me, and again decades later, having learned a great deal about American history in the mean time, the 4th episode of season 1 ""Russians R in Season"" came across very differently.  My respect for the actors, the writers, and My Favorite Martian simply grows with each viewing.",1451865600,9,2040,4.471698113207547

7339089,5,B011MU9ZIY,"My Favorite Martian: The Complete Collection is a 15-DVD set containing all 107 complete, unedited, digitally remastered episodes from the shows three seasons, along with a generous assortment of special features. Originally aired on CBS-TV from 1963 to 1966, My Favorite Martian debuted in the top 10 in its premiere season. This fantasy comedy series paved the way for such later hits as Third Rock From the Sun, Alf and Mork and Mindy. Bill Bixby (The Courtship of Eddies Father, The Incredible Hulk) stars as newspaper reporter Tim OHara and Ray Walston (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) plays the human-looking Martian whom Tim discovers, takes in as a roommate, and passes off as his Uncle Martin. Pamela Britton plays their nosey landlady, Lorelei Brown.

The Martian speaks English and refuses to admit to anyone but Tim his extraterrestrial origins. Uncle Martin has little retractable antennae, can make himself invisible, is telepathic, can move objects simply by pointing at them, and has an expansive knowledge of technological information. In the first season, Mrs. Browns teenage daughter Angela (Ann Marchall) was a cast regular. The following year, policeman Bill Brennan (Alan Hewitt) joined the cast as Mrs. Browns boyfriend, a threat to Uncle Martin not only as a potential discoverer of the Martians true identity but also a romantic rival for Mrs. Browns attentions.

The first two seasons were filmed in black and white, the final season in color. The Martians powers were increased in Season 3 to include stimulating his facial hair to provide quick disguises and levitating with his nose. Guest stars included Linda Evans, Gavin McLeod, Marlo Thomas, Jamie Farr, Bernie Kopell, Butch Patrick, Richard Deacon, Michael Constantine, Henry Gibson, Pat Priest, and Allan Melvin.

Special features include behind-the-scenes home movies; original cast and sponsor commercials; spaceship miniature test footage; Ray Walston's promotional game show and talk show appearances; Lets Talk to Lucy, 1964-1965 radio interviews with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston talking to Lucille Ball; photo galleries; original soundtrack music album; vintage program sponsor billboards and closing credits; animation and effects reel; and the TV pilots The Man in the Square Suit and The Reluctant Eye.",1445040000,20,2293,5.399441340782123
7339090,3,B011MU9ZIY,"Not as good as I remember.  As with those other magical type shows.  Too often the easiest way out of the situation is ignored.  Or one time you can do it,  next time you can't.  Every episode was pretty much the same which made it hard to watch more than two episodes at a time.  Ray Walston, is a fine actor.  Tho it  seemed as if he were  reading everything he said for this show.  Bill Bixby is (was) a natural, and always fun to watch.  I enjoyed the trip back to my childhood.  So it was worth buying this dvd set.  There were few real laughs.  Still, with all that said,  I actually is better than many shows on tv today.",1440633600,,628,4.032786885245901
