8342106,1,B001TLYZP0,DVD player won't accept disc. I think they are actually too thick.,1416614400,,66,4.583333333333333
8342107,5,B001TLYZP0,"Shipped out quickly.  I loved these movies.  Several I have never seen, but loved them.  I watched several of the 2 times! Thanks!!",1408060800,,131,4.608695652173913
8342108,5,B001TLYZP0,"The episodes take me back to when Life was much simpler. I loved them then and I do now. The boys make me laugh and the stories always send a positive, moral message. Too bad we don't have more of these kinds of messages in todays media presentations.",1391472000,,251,4.25
8342109,4,B001TLYZP0,The Bowery Boys was a good show to watch back then. It is sad that they don't make shows like this no more for young to watch. Maybe it would show right from wrong so they don't do it so we should send a message to Hollywood and change their way,1381795200,,245,3.823529411764706
8342110,3,B001TLYZP0,"One disk the mfgr did not even attempt to correct the sync between the timing of the audio vs. the visual. Glad item was like new & only paid 1/2 retail. Not seller's fault, but will watch mfgr future offerings.
This disk was for a g-man series which obviously was a serial which I never remembered ever seeing Saturday afternoons back in the 1960's. Yes, may have been sitting in cans in the back room of a movie studio for70 years, but all the more reason why mfgr should have put a bit more quality control into their work. Seems like they don't care about their reputation.",1376352000,5,577,4.401869158878505
8342111,5,B001TLYZP0,"I got the product I wanted for an excellent price.  The quality of the shows is excellent.  I've bought classic shows from this seller before, never had a quality issue.  I would recommend this collection to anyone who wants to hang out with the East Side Kids again.",1369958400,6,267,4.520833333333333
8342112,3,B001TLYZP0,"This is going to be a review of content. Review of quality will come at a later date. At first I thought this was going to be the complete collection of all the EAST SIDE KIDS films, but when I checked The Bowery Boys website I found out there were 22 East Side Kids movies not 48. I mistakenly thought maybe all the Dead End Kids and Little tough guys were included. Well that isn't the case either. Now for those who have the seven individual double feature volumes, 13 of the 14 movies are in this set. The trade-off is with this set you get the movie called East Side Kids instead of Ghosts on the Loose. So that's 14 East Side Kids movies plus three 12 chapter serials (36 total) from the Little Tough guys. 36 chapters + 14 full length features= 50 films. Not what I hoped for, but a great way to get yourself familiar with the gang. OOPS! I forgot to mention I received a 10 disc set instead of a 9 disc set which has the additional movies Flying Wild and Let's Get Tough! So instead of the 9 disc 48 films I got 10 discs 50 films. Remember that's not 50 full length features 36 of those are probably in the 15 min range.",1367539200,22,1128,4.108597285067873
8342113,5,B001TLYZP0,These are a lot of fun and I remember watching them on TV on Sunday mornings as a kid in the 60s.,1360713600,2,97,3.4545454545454546
