2625714,3,B000H1RFIC,"Recently, I bought this DVD.  Most evenings, I work out to a Tae Bo DVD four or five times a week.  I thought I'd give this one a try for the other nights.  Although it was fun to dance, I didn't find the workout challenging enough for me.  I didn't really break a sweat.  This DVD seems to be geared more towards beginners.",1183507200,3,324,4.079365079365079
2625715,1,B000H1RFIC,"This workout did not 'work out'.  With her always saying ""ah huh"", and how to 'move your hips like you are in a bowl of cereal', there was nothing else.

No sweat, no workout.  I do not recommend this",1173657600,7,200,4.076923076923077
2625716,5,B000H1RFIC,"I don't really dig workout videos, a lot of them are so boring and after doing them a few times, I often feel like it was a waste of money. I don't feel this way with this Dance off the Inches DVD. As a dancer, I completely love the moves, and can get into them, and I like the combinations Marie choreographed. I think the workout is a bit short, so I just double up on the dance routine and I burn between 375-425 calories (I use a heart rate monitor). I didn't do the intro to the dance moves, and since I have done the workout a few times, I start doing the moves to the max ( arms movements, body rolls, et. all) as soon as we start doing the routine rather than waiting for her to introduce them. The music isn't great, but I have enough fun doing the cool dance routines that I hardly notice. The workout consists of a warm-up, then a set of hip-hop-ish combinations, which you do for about 10-15 minutes. Then you do a latin combo, which has elements of the samba, cha cha, and Coimba. It's cool. After that, you cool down, and them she does some ab work on the floor. The movements definitely force you to use your mid section, and you feel sexy as you shake your hips. recommended.",1171324800,22,1191,4.16017316017316
2625717,5,B000H1RFIC,this dvd workout is great. definitly FUN. you forget thats your working out.,1168732800,5,76,4.923076923076923
2625718,4,B000H1RFIC,"This video is formated so you have a step quide and a three part workout.  I do not overly care for this, since the step quide is just boring to watch, but if you don't watch it you might have a little trouble getting started with the routines.  All the steps and combinations are pretty easy though, so you could probably pick it up on your own by the second time around.  At first I didn't think the workout was doing much for me, but my the end I did start to feel it a little bit.  With this type of tape the more you get into the dance the more you'll get out of it.  I wouldn't make this my main workout, but it is a nice change of pace for someone working out every day.  The main plus to this video is Marie Forleo, who keeps you motivated without being annoying.",1168732800,13,771,4.006535947712418
2625719,4,B000H1RFIC,"This is a new workout in the Dance Off The Inches series, which I just discovered.  Marie Forleo, who leads Crunch Cardio Dance Blast and Prevention's Dance Yourself Thin returns to lead you through a fun dance workout with some focus on the abs.  She is joined by 4 friends, including Michelle Dozois who has been seen in numerous other fitness videos.  They are ready to Dance off the Inches in a very cozy living room like setting.

There is a step guide that will teach you many of the moves that make up the foundation of the dance routines.  I found this to be very helpful as I am a complete clod when it comes to dance workouts, though I am trying to work them into my workout regimen for additional variety.  Marie will show you the move and repeat it several times depending on if there is a variation of the move in the working whether it's a traveling move or specific arm movements.

You start with a brief warmup then you go right into the first dance routine which is the Tummy Toning Funk Combo.  Steps seen in this routine include funky two steps, step touch w/a bounce, double lunges (heel toe move), triple step, twist step, hip circles, step cross, walk ups, grapevines and body rolls.  Marie teaches one step at a time, repeats it a bit until you have it down, then will gradually add on steps, each time taking the routine from the top.  While some might find this repetitive, I found it helpful to learn it faster.

The next dance routine is the latin combo, taught in the same format.  Steps in this segment include rock steps, cha chas, sunshine arms, sambas, twist & hold, lazy merengue, latin combia, more hip circles, and triple lunges.  After this segment you cooldown and stretch a little before moving on to the floor for more concentrated ab work.

The ab segment called the Belly Blaster is about 10 minutes, but contains some unique and interesting moves.  You start with traditional crunches in various counts, then you will add a knee pulling in and pressing out, then you will cross over and pulse then an isometric hold, then you will finish with some unique lower ab work.  This sequence is repeated once.  Then you will do another set of exercises including circle crunches, lift & pulses to the middle, then crossing over to each side.

I liked this workout, Marie as always does a great job here.  I am glad to see her get more leads in videos, I like her style of instruction and she is enthusiastic and fun.  She makes the steps look so easy too.  Overall a good choice for those looking for a fun dance workout that isn't too difficult.  Plus the step guide is a really helpful tool.  4 and a half stars for this one.",1163894400,29,2662,4.454545454545454
2625720,4,B000H1RFIC,"Marie Forleo is a motivating instructor that is fun to 'workout with' and cues well and makes this dvd doable.  There is a blend of ab toning and dance moves.  They are easy enough so it's really not hard to do.  When you combine the toning with fat burning aerobic work, you get great results.  It doesn't get boring because she uses a lot of variety in the moves (torso twists and hip moves, grapevines, funk moves etc etc).  I love the Latin style sambas and cumbias.  It's great.  Then at the end, it really gets more focused - you do ab floorwork.  If you are worried about not getting the dance moves down, don't worry because there is an instructional segment at the end of the workout.

It's not the toughest workout I've ever done (I think it's mainly geared toward intermediate exercisers), but it is very helpful to break the boredom from your regular workouts, and if you aren't in the mood for a very tough workout, then this is perfect.  I really like it.",1162857600,5,969,4.423728813559322

2625736,5,B000H1RFIC,Fun exercise for the less experienced.  Has a section that teaches the dance moves for those less coordinated like me. Would recommend for those who like less intense and fun.,1387152000,4,175,4.833333333333333
2625737,5,B000H1RFIC,"I purchased Marie Forleo's Cardio Dance Blast  this past year and have enjoyed it. It has not been a daily use DVD but I do go back to it repeatedly. I like variety and various levels of intensity and have acquired a nice collection with that available to me. So I just bought her Dance Off the Inches Tummy Tone as well and think it is a bit more of a workout than Cardio Dance Blast but not too much so. I never sweat with her workouts, which I like to have happen, but do experience that sense of well-being after doing one. I like the Dance Off the Inches quite a bit, a bit more than the Cardio Dance Blast and maybe it is a bit more fun, too. Both of  hers go fast and before I know it, I have done a nice little workout. I just bought a portable DVD player I plan to use for travel for my exercise workouts primarily and would easily take Dance Off the Inches for that use. If you are looking for a mid level workout DVD, with clear explanations that goes quickly Dance Off the Inches would likely fit,",1384646400,,1009,4.065326633165829

2625739,5,B000H1RFIC,"I have 4 dance exercise videos and I like this one the best.  It is a great workout and it is fun.  Some of the dance videos teach you the dance moves during the segment, so once you know it, you still have to go slow at the start of the workout.  This one has a separate section to learn the moves.  I picked up most of them without going to the learning section.",1384560000,,364,3.8783783783783785
2625740,5,B000H1RFIC,"I acquired this DVD a few years ago, but never really started using it until last year...after Hurricane Sandy hit and we went to my aunt's house for the weekend.  Marie Forleo is spirited and energetic, and the dance moves are not difficult to follow at all.  The only thing that I tend to have trouble with--which has more to do with me--is body placement.  Otherwise, I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to exercise, but wants a great cardio workout that's good fun.  There's also an ab workout directly afterward if you want to incorporate some type of strength/core training.",1383609600,,608,4.654205607476635
2625741,3,B000H1RFIC,I like this video. Not too long and while at first you're thinking ok. This may be a lot of nothing  but before long you do feel it in your midsection. I like the fact that the moves are not too over the.top. I don't feel as ridiculous doing this one while my husband sits on the couch haha,1379894400,,290,3.9152542372881354
2625742,5,B000H1RFIC,"I saw this on YouTube and had to have it for myself. I love it. My first choice is always a Leslie Sansone DVD, but this one is a nice addition to my in-house work outs. I have knee issues, so I can't go as hard as I want to initially, but I love the energy of the instructor and the price was fantastic. A real keeper. I like mixing up my work out, this was perfect for me.",1378857600,,374,3.7468354430379747
2625743,5,B000H1RFIC,"If you are like me  and not exactly fit but just want a way to get your body moving a little, this is a great exercise video.  I concentrate more on keeping time with the moves and not so much that I'm working out and I enjoy it alot more.  I started out just dancing to the first half hour and then once I get better at it, I move on the floor exercises.  I use this  about 3 x a week, It's great!!",1377302400,,399,3.7023809523809526

2625747,5,B000H1RFIC,"THIS Product was ordered to obtain a low impact workout that was fun, energetic and would allow to drop the inches, all expectations have been met and Marie Forleo's voice is easily tolerated",1367625600,,191,4.818181818181818
2625748,5,B000H1RFIC,I love this video because the instructor is great at teaching the steps before the workout and she makes it fun.  The ab section at the end is nice also.,1357344000,,153,4.1

2625751,4,B000H1RFIC,"I love Marie Forleo.  I first bought her Crunch Workout Cardio Dance Blast and wanted to try more with her so I bought the Dance off the Inches video.  This video shows her in the exact same outfit (shallow, I know) as the Crunch video and neither the dancers nor the music seem as ""hip"" as in the Crunch video (again, shallow, I know.) However, I really enjoy this video because I hate doing ""workouts"" and love dancing, even though I'm not trained in dance in any way. Also, I want to work on the tummy zone post 2nd pregnancy/over 40 so I do like variety and the short floor-work section works your abs without burning you out.

One thing I've found with this particular video is that a few certain steps focus on only one side, so I just try doing the opposite side for a few of the reps-working the brain as well! Finally, how can you beat the price?? Consider what one workout costs in the gym and even if you use this only once it's a 3rd to a 4th of the cost of one class.",1352419200,,980,4.147368421052631
2625752,4,B000H1RFIC,"In this video, Marie breaks down new moves and then repeats them twice before going on to the full fledged movements. I'll admit that I used to dance so it was not hard for me to pick up the moves. I do this routine with a weight belt on, so I definitely work up a sweat. 12 lbs down so far!",1350172800,,291,3.7868852459016393
2625753,4,B000H1RFIC,"I checked this work out at the library.  By the time I had to take it back, I ordered 3 of Maries vidios from Amazon.  I had them in the mail by that very week.  That's what I call action.",1348790400,,188,3.65
2625754,5,B000H1RFIC,"I purchased this DVD specifically because of the reviews stating it's a beginners workout. I wanted something easy to learn and get used to since I've never done a dance style workout and my balance isn't the greatest. The DVD worked well for me, getting me used to a fairly easy workout that didn't take to long to learn. It did not take me long, maybe two weeks, to feel like I needed to go to the next level but overall I enjoyed this DVD. It's a fun, easy introduction to dance style workouts.",1346716800,5,497,4.297872340425532
2625755,5,B000H1RFIC,This is a great video and you don't even realize you're working out! Marie makes it really fun and easy to follow. I love it!,1340150400,,125,4.04
2625756,4,B000H1RFIC,"I enjoyed this video! It was easy to follow along with, even without the Step Guide. It got my heart rate up and I broke a sweat. I really like Maria and all of her videos. I would also recommend the ""Wedding Day Workout"" even if you're not getting married. Maria is great and this video is a great workout!",1337817600,,307,4.133333333333334
2625757,5,B000H1RFIC,"I really enjoyed this workout and learning all the dance moves and found that if you give it your all you can work up a sweat which I did. This is a fun workout and not a grueling one which gives you the time to have fun, learn dance moves and tone your whole body and abs while burning calories. The instructor is sweet and easy to follow while she gives good instructions. I have read reviews that say this is not grueling enough or does not get you sweating and soI have to say that I am close to being an advanced exerciser who has exercised most days of the week for 25 years and this makes me sweat.  Of course I put a lot into it energy wise as I am used to exercising. What you are not being told about these grueling exercise routines is that while they are great once in a while they actually break the body down and the body becomes stubborn and because the body sees it as a stressor you will start accumulating fat on the stomach because of cortisol.  So people don't think you have to do grueling exercise to lose weight because its not the truth.  Anyway, I recommend this to people who want to have fun while working out.",1337385600,2,1137,4.159090909090909
2625758,4,B000H1RFIC,"I discovered this DVD and since I like to do dance based exercise, thought I would try it out.  I am a beginner and I always break a sweat doing the routines.  I have never used the included step guide because I had no trouble jumping into the moves the first time that I tried it.  That's probably because Marie Forleo is a great instructor.  I have enjoyed other exercise DVDs with her leading.  She has a very clear style and is easy to follow with lots of enthusiasm.  She also explains and demonstrates the moves very clearly.  The entire dance part is about 30 minutes long.  I agree with other reviewers that this DVD is probably best for beginners or for people who want a fun, different workout.  When I feel that the moves are becoming too easy, I try to amp it up and make my moves bigger to have more of a workout.

The included ab workout is about 10 minutes long and always makes my abs hurt.  The moves are simple enough to do, but my abs definately feel worked out afterwards.

When I feel like my workout has gotten into a rut, I really enjoy this DVD to put some fun back into things!",1333929600,,1102,4.220095693779904
2625759,3,B000H1RFIC,"Marie Forleo leads you in easy to follow, low impact dance moves that help shape your abdominals.  This is a great video if you are out of shape or a beginner in the world of dance videos.  The moves are very simple and small and would mostly suit anyone who has knee, foot or hip problems due to the lack of jumping/bouncing that is normally found in dance videos.  If you focus on your abs and do the moves properly, you should be able to feel your abs tightening (and maybe even burning).  It isn't comparable to a killer six pack mat routine, but if you have neck problems then a standing ab routine like this one is a safer choice.

If you are looking for something more challenging with a higher impact fat burning dance routine, then I would not recommend this video.  I did this video when I was first beginning and it was great, but now my cardiovascular health is improved and I don't feel the benefits that I felt before.  In other words, if you are on the more fit side, then you will probably find this routine boring and not stimulating enough.  I have to add a lot of hops and jumps and arm flailing to make this video more beneficial and fun for me.

This video has a very 90's-ish bland feel to it (the dance music, the boring outfits) which doesn't help with the exciting factor, and Miss Forleo lacks the cheesy (but sincere) enthusiasm that I admire in workout gurus like Richard Simmons.  She says things like ""uh huh, work it"" in a very dry and recited way, as if she were reading it off of a cue card.  However, she does have a nice voice which is a big plus if you find the squeaky voice of the stereotypical workout instructor obnoxious.

In short, if you are looking for a low-cardio-impact that is easy on the joints, then this is the video for you.  If you want something with a quicker more exciting sweaty pace, then you may want to expand your search.",1332201600,10,1882,4.3125
2625760,3,B000H1RFIC,"This one doesn't show Marie at her best; she's demonstrating the moves with other women who've done their own videos, like Michelle and Stella, and she seems a little ill at ease.  I don't think the workout is strenuous enough to provide much benefit for most exercisers either.",1293753600,2,278,4.791666666666667
2625761,1,B000H1RFIC,"If you're a beginner or very overweight and don't want to just do walking workouts, this might be something to try. However, it's super boring, very easy (step guide definitely not needed), slow and without sweat.",1256860800,,213,4.944444444444445
2625762,1,B000H1RFIC,This product took longer than the estimated time to arrive. It seemed fun when I poped it into the DVD player. I really enjoyed doing the moves for 5 min. Then the DVD began skipping. I skipped through the jumping areas then it froze. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase!,1241049600,,278,4.470588235294118
2625763,5,B000H1RFIC,The exercise routines are easier to follow compared to other dance exercise videos. Highly recommend for someone who dose not know all the salsa moves.,1232236800,,151,5.08
2625764,3,B000H1RFIC,"This dvd is definitely geared for the beginner. The moves are done at 1/2 pace & are a bit modified or vanilla so they are easy to follow. Half of the dance portion is mixed jazzy/common moves & half latin. The latin seemed at least was somewhat normal speed since real latin dancing is VERY fast. The last 10 min is a mat reclined common ab exercises.
Those of you who have any dance training, decent natural talent, or have several dance workout dvds will find this too easy & mediocre. Those who workout more then once a week on average will find the pace too easy unless for a light day. All others who feel they have two left feet, are new to dance workouts or fitness will love this.

This DVD is kinda fun and is designed to tone those dreaded abs without  having to get on the floor and do crunches although that is there too. The other thing that I like is that it doesn't require a lot of room.  Imagine yourself dancing on a crowded dance floor and that's pretty much it.

Since I don't have a lot of coordination either, I just draw the shades and do the first twenty minutes.  It doesn't feel like exercise and that's the part I like.",1191974400,7,619,4.293103448275862
