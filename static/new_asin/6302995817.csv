532027,5,6302995817,"It amazes me that this film, along with ""The Music Lovers"" and ""Devils"" has not been bundled into a Ken Russell retrospective and released on DVD. Savage Messiah was one of his more serious films and a tribute to the young artist, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who died in WWI.I will always remember a bit of wit from this film. It is a fable that goes like this....A baby bird falls from his nest on a cold day and is found by a kindly farmer just before he freezes to death. Wishing to keep him warm until his mother can retrieve him, the farmer places the little bird in the warm smoking center of fresh cow dung. After the little fellow warms up, he sticks his head out of the dung and begins to chirp for his mother. He is unfortunately seen by a hungry fox who runs over and bites off his head. The moral of the story is....Its not always your enemies who get you into the dung and not always your friends who get you out...How true!!

I would love to see this film resurrected from the dung and digitally restored for the silver disk.",1120867200,21,1034,4.275510204081633

532150,4,6302995817,"A dramatization of the short, influential career of pre-WWI sculptor Henri Gaudier and his platonic relationship with a woman 20 years older. A slick production, it seemed to me to be rather superficial, as though the actors didn't really connect with their characters. The best thing about this was an appearance of an early-career Helen Mirren.",1412985600,,346,5.196428571428571

532152,5,6302995817,"This is a wonderful film.  I saw a 16mm print of it forty years ago, in a classroom. This DVD edition is obviously much better, technically, but even if it weren't, the work itself is essential for Russell fans or those fortunate few who've had a chance to develop a taste for Henri Gaudier-Brzesca.

532155,5,6302995817,"This production gives an excellent introduction to the life & influence of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who was a leading - if controversial - representative of the Vorticist movement, although he himself vehemently preferred not to belong to any particular school. His affinity to Ezra Pound's and Wyndham Lewis's Vorticist views gave way to a growing interest in extra-European art, in particular from Japan, West Africa, and the Pacific Islands. His later works also show influences of Cubism and of ideographic art. The film illustrates the artist's voracious interest in new aesthetic conecpts and makes his struggles for the perfect form come vividly alive.",1353369600,,657,5.450980392156863
532156,5,6302995817,"I don't usually like Ken Russell movies but this is the exception.  The script was written by a poet and it is sheer pleasure to hear.  There are long unedited scenes of movement & dialogue and Scott Antony chiseling, drinking, and smoking while speaking dialogue at the same time is riveting.  The naked Mirren scenes remind me of a Maxfield Parrish painting.  Not for everyone so watch before buying.  BE AWARE:  THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT FRENCH SCULPTOR HENRI GAUDIER AND SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH A MOVIE OF THE SAME TITLE ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER.",1347580800,,545,4.684210526315789
532194,5,6302995817,"As a rule I don't like Ken Russell movies but SAVAGE MESSIAH is the exception.  Some movies are gems, this movie is a beautiful pearl. The script was written by a poet so the dialogue is remarkable and listening a sheer pleasure. There is not a lot of action but the actor chiseling,smoking,drinking,and speaking all at the same time was riveting.  The naked Mirren scenes reminded me of a Maxfield Parrish painting and the humor is sharp. This is a movie that is an experience every time I play it. Not for everyone so rent or find a Ken Russell site that shows it for free before buying.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ABOUT FRENCH SCULPTOR HENRI GAUDIER, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH A MOVIE OF THE SAME TITLE ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER.",1333324800,,725,4.43609022556391
532195,4,6302995817,"Over the years, the Ken Russell film I've thought about more than any other is the biographical portrait of French sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska.  Not a great film, but it burned itself into a deep place in my psyche.  Perhaps it's because of the searingly intense portrayal of the innate need of true artists (and madmen?) to be creative.  Gaudier-Brzeska fought in WW I; he received a decoration for bravery, but was killed in the trenches at Neuville-Saint-Vaast. During his time in the Army, he sculpted a figure out of the butt of a rifle taken from a German soldier.  I will always remember that primitive carving.  Even Helen Mirren's brave full frontal nudity takes a back seat -- well, almost -- to the art of Gaudier-Brzeska.  Listen for the brilliant use of Claude Debussy's powerful music as part of the movie's fine score.",1323561600,7,836,4.811188811188811
532196,5,6302995817,"So what if is a DVD-R?  I would be happy having a ten-year old VCR tape recording from TV.

What I remember from 40 years ago in The Flick theatre is the great ending.  Russell, in this period, was rather restrained.",1323302400,,216,4.219512195121951
532197,5,6302995817,"Perhaps Ken Russell's greatest work and surely his most underrated. Well, we all know that ALL of his work is as underrated as it is unfairly reviewed by the mainstream petty dictators known as Ebert, Kael et al. This film is a minimalist film which harkens back to Ken's work with the BBC yet adds colour and many ""Ken-isms"" to the wonderful story of two artists struggling to survive. I can't find any fault in this film and do not want to give anything away-this film is superb. You may be shocked at the ending and shocked at a VERY young Helen Mirren 100% nude as (what else) an ascending and descending nude. A perfect hourglass figure in a perfect film by the world's greatest living or in heaven film director.",1311120000,23,718,4.488549618320611
532198,4,6302995817,"It is a DVD-R and may not play on all systems, but in my case it works on a standard player, a recorder, and computer.
Is in widescreen but apparently does not suffer from cropping, which is when a full screen image (4:3) has the top and bottom of the screen cut off to be made to look like a widesceen movie, as 1.85:1 transfers usually are.
And is remastered as it says, i have what i believe to be the final VHS release of this movie and this DVD-R looks much better than that tape.
Very expensive but worth it if you are a fan of Helen Mirren.",1308441600,14,547,4.027522935779817
532199,4,6302995817,"What I mean by ""better quality"" is that unlike other Warner ""archive classic"" releases, it doesn't look like it was transferred from a ""decent"" VHS tape, like Paul Simon's ""One Trick Pony."" After the so-called ""restored"" release of ""The Devils"" ten years ago which apparently used elements that literally looked like they were picked-up off the cutting room floor without any effort at clean-up, and the so-so looking ""Valentino,"" perhaps Ken Russell insisted that this release not embarrass him or his fans. The picture quality is not entirely clean but it is reasonably clear (particularly Helen Mirren's scenes), so calling it ""remastered"" is true in relative terms. If you are in desperate need of this DVD (or you really like Mirren), then the $29.95 is acceptable, but you can get this for $10 less on Warner's website.",1306713600,2,825,5.029197080291971
532200,3,6302995817,"I would love to see this film, which has never been widely available, at least in the U.S. However, although the Amazon copy says DVD, the price and the Warners Archive imprint are both indicative of those wretched DVD-Rs (generally the same quality you can burn off a TV transmission, at 25 times the cost). If anyone buys this, could you post a review that indicates the format. Thanks",1306281600,4,387,4.6231884057971016
532201,4,6302995817,"I was shocked but very happy to see that Warner Archives finally got around to releasing Russell's early 1970s biographical film on French sculptor Henri Gaudier. This is one of Russell's less strident works and is quite effective in showing the rather odd platonic relationship between the artist and Sophie Brzeska, a Polish woman twenty years older than Gaudier. The performances are good, especially Dorothy Tutin as Sophie. Scott Antony as the artist Gaudier has his moments though some would say Russell's portrayal of him as a hyperactive bohemian is a little excessive. But what would a Ken Russell film be without a little excess!! Theres also a flamboyant performance from Helen Mirren as a radical suffragette and a scene of her descending a flight of stairs that might surprise current admirers.(of course, this was a very early role for her). A nice touch comes at the end of the film where Russell has managed to collect actual works of the artist for a posthumous exhibition.(Gaudier was killed in a WWI battle in France and was only in his early 20s).The scene, intercutting images of a grieving Sophie with the impressive sculptors underlines the artist's loss, both personally for her and the art world in general.  As for the dvd this is a very barebones affair. It is a DVD-R and there are no subtitles nor chapters. The film has been remastered and is widescreen(16x9)1:85.1 ratio. Though not flawless, its the best quality I've seen of this film and for admirers of this particular film I would recommend it. I'm afraid this might be as good as we'll ever see for this film. So, thank you Warners for releasing this(and The Boyfriend for Russell completist!). Now Warners...when are you going to release your other Russell property, The Devils!!!????",1304812800,5,1772,4.946308724832215

532203,5,6302995817,"Before there was ""Tommy"", and ""The Boyfriend"", and a lot of other Ken Russell films that deserve to be forgotten, there was ""Women in Love"", ""The Music Lovers"", ""The Devils"", and this little gem.  Read the other reviews for their insightful comments.  I would only like to add that what sets this particular film apart is Russell's use of the sculptor's own works to emphasize the beauty and originiality of Gaudier-Breszka's vision.  Russell's films (even the bad ones) are all visually striking.  Here he has help from the small extant collection of the sculptures themselves.  As befits the biography of a visual artist, this film is a treat for the eye as well as the spirit.",1136764800,7,679,4.818965517241379

7833806,5,6302995817,"For a brief period the only man who could rival Stanley Kubrick for cinematic excellence was Ken Russell.

Savage Messiah (1972) is a fast and furious biopic about an energetic young sculptor, and the older woman he is in love with.  I have seen this film a number of times, and am always amazed at the sheer energy it exudes.

But now a warning -- this disc seems to be produced under some kind of cost-cutting regime: it warns that it will probably work in most play only DVD players.  Sure enough, mine failed.
