3572509,5,B001FB4W0W,"I am so addicted to this show!  Everyday on my lunch break I scour the internet looking for articles, photos, blogs etc. related to this show.  The characters are so fleshed out, I find that I cannot wait to see how the story will continue each week.

I just bought the first Charlaine Harris book last week and began reading it at chapter 6 to follow along with the show.  I couldn't wait until the next episode so I would read the next chapter of the book to get my fix.  In my opinion it is pretty close to what I have seen on screen so far. I couldn't put the book down either and have now finished it.

I am so happy to hear that the show has been renewed for another season.  I also can't wait to own the DVDs when they are available.  I was so happy to read the other reviews here because I thought I was the only one who felt this way!",1224201600,4,843,3.9761904761904763
3572510,5,B001FB4W0W,"I was never into Vampires. I never read Anne Rice, or watched Buffy The Vampire Slayer on a regular basis...exactly as Alan Ball describes himself. Which is probably exactly why and how Alan Ball has gotten me completely wrapped up in this series: True Blood. Yes, it is very graphic, as others have described. It plainly lists every warning before the title roles: Violence, Strong Sexual Content, Nudity, Adult Content, and Adult Language. I have never really been a fan of any of those (graphic attributes) either...however...this series is amazing!

A friend of mine mentioned True Blood after the first 2 episodes aired. I had seen the white HBO poster with the lips and blood, and still...it did NOT entice me to view. Then I had too much spare time because of a back injury and I flipped through On Demand. Ironically, I had never used that particular feature of my DVR either. But there it was...True Blood...and the enthusiasm my friend had gushed about this show rang in my ears. I flipped on the first episode...and didn't stop watching until all 5 had been consumed with my pure, complete fascination. The characters are complete living, breathing full-faceted individuals (except for the vampires...remove breathing with enticing)...*wink. The relationship of Sookie and Bill are great! Kudos to Stephen Moyer as the HOT `hero' Vampire. Needless to say, I have now watched the 5 first episodes TWICE...and I cannot wait until episode 6 airs this Sunday...I am on pins and needles to see how they handle the death of (I won't spoil it).

I am sure the books are different, as the readers of the series have pointed out. Book series are always better than the translation to television or film; nobody will ever be able to live up to our own imagination. Because of that, Charlaine Harris will also be getting my money...I have ordered all 8 of her `Southern Vampire' novels. That is what happens when a brilliant writer creates fascinating characters. I can't wait until True Blood comes out on DVD! So, everyone will be getting my money from this series...ha!

Hey, HBO...there are 8 novels...so I hope that means you will be letting us consume 8 seasons of this delicious series!",1223683200,3,2193,4.873994638069705
3572511,5,B001FB4W0W,"OMG, I just LOVE this series! It has everything: sex, violence, family conflict, references to the paranormal, and comments on race relations. And of course Vampires. I haven't missed a single airing since it began in September.
I think I might even like it more than *gasp* Heroes.
Only 4 episodes have been shown and I already want the box set!
I haven't read the Charlaine Harris novels (I plan to) so that won't affect your enjoyment of the series.
I hope there are lot's of extras included on the DVD's such as deleted scenes, cast and crew interviews, commentaries, etc.
And Stephen Moyer, Bill the Vampire, is totlly hot!",1222992000,,628,4.718181818181818
3572512,5,B001FB4W0W,"HBO Series True Blood is perfect to me! This is the only show that has kept me anticipating every new episode. Now I had not read the books prior to watch the show, so seeing comments from all of Charlaine's of all the differences between the show and books prompted me to go ahead and purchase at least books 1-4 today.

However I doubt even after reading the books that my perception will change. I love the show and the Bill Compton and Sookie Stackhouse characters are wonderful. I think the casting of Anna Paquin as Sookie and Stephen Moyer as Bill was brilliant!

I'm glad to hear that HBO has renewed the show for a 2nd season and I cannot wait until the entire season one is available on DVD. I have all 1-4 episodes aired so far on DVR so that's my Bill and Sookie fix until every Sunday at 9 pm.

3572513,4,B001FB4W0W,"I haven't read the books yet, so I can't speak to the faithfulness of the show to the original author's creation. I'm planning on ordering some of them today actually. I hadn't even heard of the show until my On Demand channel started advertising it and I ordered the first episode out of curiosity. (vampire movies have always fascinated me anyway)
  On the negative side, the show's theme music is interesting but I found the graphics that went with it somewhat off-putting. I suppose you can say that images of death and decay coupled with footage of KKK gatherings and river Baptisms are relevant to the show's material and setting, but I just found it bizarre and a bit repulsive.  Also, I agree with another reviewer that the show does come off a tad heavy on the soft core sex scenes.  The bodies are certainly pretty enough, particularly the sexually compulsive Jason and the thoroughly entertaining Lafayette. But I could do without yet another scene of Jason banging some girl's head into a wall...or a bedboard...or a mirror.  Lastly, some of the acting on the part of the supporting cast is below par.  If I have to listen to Diane the cheesy vampiress giggle her way through another scene I may have to mute the TV until it's over.

  As for the positives, the show got it's figurative fangs in me and won't let go. The budding relationship between Bill and Sookie is very compelling. It definitely carries the show. It's interesting that while everyone else is jumping into bed, Bill's slow seduction of the virginal Sookie is the most erotic thing happening. Ana Paquin is delightfully innocent and off beat and Stephen Moyer is excitingly intense and dangerous while still managing to be a tender, considerate southern gentleman. The musical score for their scenes is also very well crafted.

  I know I'm supposed to like Sam, after all, he's a good guy and adores Sookie. But honestly the guy creeps me out, and that was before the wierd bedsheets scene. As for the rest of the cast, the other standout for me is Nelsan Ellis. Lafayette just makes me laugh. Humor is something else the show does well. (""Angelina Adopts Vampire Baby"" is a headline that you just know would be out there in this scenario) Lafayette is larger than life and twice as sassy, and you can't help but like him despite his rather dubious sidelines. His support of his cousin, Tara, lends additional depth and compassion to his character.
Overall, while the show has weaknesses (and to be fair, it is only in its first season) I will definitely be watching to see how it develops.",1222646400,23,2572,4.703786191536748
3572514,5,B001FB4W0W,"True Blood is great so far.  It's a hard show to put on with all the characters and scenes.  I think HBO has done a great job with the casting and putting different story lines in the show.  They are fleshing out the characters now and we are slowly getting more into the story.  The scenes with Sookie and Bill are mesmerising.  The are trying to take us on the journey with Sookie, in the latest episode showing that vampires can be very dangerous.  The music is spectacular and the opening of each show is divine.  I'm thrilled that they upped for another season.",1222646400,9,566,4.384615384615385
3572515,4,B001FB4W0W,"No, the show does not follow the books that inspired it line for line. And yes, there is a lot of nudity---but it is on HBO and at night for goodness sakes! So far, 4 episodes in, I can say that the casting and music really do justice to Charlaine Harris's series of books about Sookie Stackhouse, a barmaid in small town LA, but Alan Ball has made the story his own as well. Check it out on demand or get the DVD when it comes out....Moyer is sexy as hell!",1222646400,38,457,4.032967032967033
3572516,2,B001FB4W0W,"Truly, I am disappointed with this series! The books are way better! HBO has done a disservice to this wonderful series. Blood Ties on Lifetime back in 2006 was ten times - no, a hundred times better than True Blood. I have ordered HBO specifically so I could watch True Blood. I was willing to give this series a chance, but by Episode three, it became evident to me that all there was to this series was soft porn! I mean, the brother is a HO, a tru MANBO, he is a slut and a self invovled moron, which you can kind of laugh at his exploits, I mean its obvious what he is. But then suddenly everyone, everywhere in the series was getting it on. They took a wonderful imaginative idea and turned it in to a Porn Flick. And way too much bad language. Every word is a cuss word, I swear it. The only redeeming qualities in this show is that has amazing music in the background, very moving music, from modern rock to violins that make you breathless and turn a moment into a truly moving one. So the music gets ten points but this show only gets a 2 outof 10! That's right! This show sucks, big time! Sucks with big pointy teethe and porno!",1222387200,22,1139,4.181818181818182
3572613,1,B001FB4W0W,"This show caught my attention because of the vampires,and supernatural. But after watching the first season I wish I could get my life back at least the hours spent trying to see if it was going to get any better. The actors chosen for the main parts are terrible!!!

This show gives us a closer look at bigotry, drug use, homophobia, religious acts of violence, violence in general, murderers born of hate... I love that this show is able to really go into all of that in a way that is both in your face and discreet all at the same time. Give it a chance, make it through season 1. I promise it picks up.

3572667,2,B001FB4W0W,"This show had so much promise. Bill, the male lead, is a great character. It's topical. But I can't take the sexism. The female characters are: A ditz, a biatch, a drunk, psychopaths (more than one) silly, stupid. One exception is killed off halfway through the first season. Male characters talk about putting women in their place, without irony.  I want to keep watching to find out what happens next, but I can't watch it just for Bill. The main character, Sookie, is a ditz who always needs to be calmed down by a man. Her best friend Tara is a loudmouth who continually flies off the handle and needs to be fixed so she can find a man.  Another female character is a spoiled brat who needs to be schooled by, you guessed it, a man. The main message of the show seems to be that women can't function unless a man is in charge. Goodbye True Blood, I made it almost through Season one but this relationship had to end. Ultimately it was an abusive relationship.",1514764800,,963,4.404494382022472
3572668,4,B001FB4W0W,"Great story line, love most of the characters. I really like Eric's character and Jessica's. I think the show could go with out most of the sex scenes. I got through the first two episodes thinking I am not sure if I cared for it but at the same time I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Now on the 2nd season.  I think a couple of times a scene just went a little out there and dragged on. It's one of those you don't know if you want to watch it to wanting to know what happens all at the same time. It's like Vampire Diaries mixed with the Originals and a lot of people are saying nothing compared to Twilight but there is always a love triangle in every movie series.",1514505600,,682,4.014705882352941

3572671,4,B001FB4W0W,"The show really took a long time to grow on me. Then my feelings about it kept changing. It went from disliking it, loving it, feeling blah about it, and this is kinda dumb. By the 7th season I'm back to loving it. It may start off a tad bit slow but it gets more interesting as the characters develop. There are a few characters/actors in this show that really draw you in and is seriously what makes the show. First place, hands down, goes to the actress who plays Eric's progeny Pam. Then it's a tie between several others. Love the characters Lafayette, Jessica, Eric, Arlene, and Alcide. There's probably some more, but these are the ones which stand out. If you're thinking about watching this show be prepared for a lot of fantasy type topics. It's not just about vampires. There are werewolves, fairies, shape shifters, witchcraft and black magic. A bit unrealistic, but nevertheless you won't be bored. It's HBO so you know there will be your fair share of violence, nudity, sex, blood, and gore. The blood and gore isn't over the top though.",1511827200,,1051,4.595744680851064
3572672,4,B001FB4W0W,"I've been reading the series by Charlaine Harris (composed of 13 books and begins with Dead Until Dark).  It's pretty good and Sookie Stackhouse is a very endearing and entertaining narrator who I easily fell in love with.  I've been told the show is pretty good for years, but I've never been much of a vampire or paranormal fan... so here I am years later finally giving it a shot.  And I have to say it's a funny and engaging interpretation of the book series.  My initial impressions are that some characters get bigger roles and they really jacked up the sex to the point of gratuitous porn (and I'm not a prude)... but it's HBO, so that's to be expected.  On the other hand, this is such an ignorant and dopey Southern universe that it seems about right for them to be obsessed with primal pursuits.

In the books Sookie is my favorite part, hands down... but in the show it's easier for me to appreciate what a wildly kooky genre-crossing universe this really is.  And somehow it all just works! It's got a little bit of everything from horror to romance to comedy and beyond.  I'm loving all the contrasts of these serious vampires and these simple southerners.  It's kind of a parody of stereotypes and still has a lot of heart.  And as addictive as a good soap opera.  Anna Paquin isn't exactly the Sookie Stackhouse I pictured while reading... but after a while, I could see she definitely embodies the spirit of the character and does a great job.

Definitely going to watch more of the series.  I think Ms. Harris must be proud they did something really entertaining and successful with her books.",1511481600,,1610,4.548611111111111

There's camp, there's cheese, and the supporting characters are way more interesting than the main woman ""Sookie"".  I've often described this show as 'not going to win an Emmy"", but before putting that in writing I decided to look it up.  Well, folks, it won an Emmy for best casting.

3572913,3,B001FB4W0W,"I have mixed opinions about this show. Its value is higher than something you'd see on regular TV, but it's still filled with all the same problems of every other show out there. I was disappointed to see it have such a messy, ridiculous plot. It was also hard for me to really like any of the characters for very long. They were all sort of lovable (except for Jason) at the start but quickly became aggravating.

That's because the writing wasn't very good. The characters changed their opinions (and love interests) with the wind depending on how the writers wanted the plot to go. The best example is that Sookie (the main character, sort of) switched back and forth between two guys about 3-4 times in the last couple of episodes, depending on who she was mad at, without batting an eye. I feel like the writers got lazy during the second half of the season and just said ""f*** character development and realistic plot, let's just throw darts!""

Most of all, ridiculous coincidences are one of the things that pull me right out of the story and remind me that there's a director, producer, and screenwriters manipulating the plot. ""How to Drama: Make main character's best friend have abusive problems with her mother. Mother thinks she has demon inside her. Mother gets an exorcism and magically changes her ways. Daughter is convinced expensive exorcism will change her, too. Daughter magically comes into $800. Daughter has exorcism. Next day, daughter finds exorcist in drug store and realizes everything was a lie.""

""How to Drama, Part II: Step one: get Bill (vampire love interest) out of the town for two days. Sookie will be mad, denounce their whole relationship, and get with Sam (her boss I thought she was morally against having a relationship with at the start). Step two: Bill gets back EXACTLY when Sookie and Sam are making out. Sookie throws Bill out.""

And Jason's character (Sookie's brother) is a joke. I hated him the entire time. He's a slut, ran away from a dead woman's body he thought he might be responsible for, started doing drugs, kidnapped a man and tortured him, cleaned up his what was left of his body without more remorse than a pile of vomit, and still mourns the woman who roped him into kidnapping in the first place! And now he's come back like he's still a good guy, and now he's going to join a cult?!

(And they added an annoying, entitled teenage girl vampire? WHY? I smell headaches and disgusting sexualization of said teenage girl.)

I feel like Jason is the epitome of what I don't like about the show. Flighty ideas and plot holes that didn't get cleaned up. I don't know if I'll watch season 2. Overall, it's not a bad show to watch compared to a lot of things out there, but it sucks to have to settle for this kind of writing.",1498867200,,2782,4.598790322580645

3572994,2,B001FB4W0W,The show is not bad to watch. Although it is highly prejudicial of southern white people. I don't see how attacking and poking fun of only one group of people in a show adds to the story in any way. If it does ... then why not poke fun of all races?

3572996,1,B001FB4W0W,"I cannot even get through the first episode of True Blood. It's like they hired a porn director from the International School of Cliches to make this show. Literally, every character is a walking stereotype. The main white girl is the untouched southern belle that everyone wants to get with because she's the ""good girl"". The only black woman, who can't be over 30 years old, brings up slavery in every conversation and, in most conversations, she picks a random white person to yell at who was simply minding their own business before she targeted them. The only gay guy is so sexual that every word out of his mouth is about how he wants to bang everything, like he can't even live a normal life because sex is his every thought. He even humps the kitchen counter at the bar he works at. The vampire is a mix of Edward Cullen and Jack the Ripper, dark, brooding, and stalking women who then fall for him. The main white guy is a backwoods bar keep in love with the main white girl, and whose ""protectiveness"" borders on literal obsessive possession of another human being to the point where he hires a bartender just to ""keep an eye"" on his love interest.

It's literally like the director plucked a handful of stereotypes and threw them on screen. The dialogue is forced, there are awkwardly long pauses between action that make me wonder if someone forgot their lines, and the vampire biology is even off. (What kind of vampire has fangs for front teeth instead of eye teeth?) Literally, the only reason I can even fathom that this show was ever a hit was because there's full-on nudity and uncomfortable sex scenes, and that every viewer of this show was either a horny teenager or a seriously desperate bachelor.

If you have even an ounce of gray matter, or value the number of brain cells you currently contain inside your skull, don't watch True Blood. There is literally not one good thing about this show, despite the hype. You'll be utterly bored whenever you are not cringing n your seat from the awkward sex scenes. I'm pretty sure that I've dropped an IQ point from watching this pilot. I feel like I need to go solve some algebra problems now to regain my intelligence.",1493942400,,2186,4.573979591836735

3572998,5,B001FB4W0W,"I was addicted to the book series and a loyal fan so it was really hard at first to follow some of the changes HBO made that was very different from the books, especially making Bill's role much larger and Eric lessoned. I would have preferred HBO to capture the romance between Sookie and Eric and hated that HBO left that out almost completely which was much more involved in the books and I truly fell in love with them as a couple. Sookie made Eric better and they also left almost all of Pam and her adventures and loves out of HBO series, forcing me to basically refer to the book series as a loosely portrayal to the HBO version and use is mostly as a guide line to fall in love with it all over again but in a new form. Still one of my favorite shows of all time and was sad to see it end.",1493424000,,797,4.018867924528302

By the time I gave up (S1E8), characters are neither relatable nor exciting enough to capture attention and imagination.",1488326400,,379,4.890625

The first scene, nay, the first sixty seconds, provide all the notice necessary.  Watching it unfold was like running a can opener around a tin of spoiled tuna fish. There is (just barely) enough watchable stuff available elsewhere that this series is an easy miss.  I have no quarrel with the premise. There were several Japanese anime series that dealt with it very effectively.  This version is just low class, grind-house trash.",1487203200,,556,4.882978723404255

3573272,5,B001FB4W0W,"I heard all the audio books in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  Author Charlaine Harris did a wonderful job with Sookie.  At first, I had a bit of adjustment to make, because the story line leaves the printed books.  They took a left turn from the path, and never looked back.
I gave True Blood a chance, and found it very entertaining.  Somehow, True Blood stays true to the characters, if not so much to the story line.
I recommend the entire series to anyone who likes dark comedy, light horror, quirky characters, and a healthy dose of sexy situations.
Not for children.

3574634,3,B001FB4W0W,"So far I'm half way into Season 2.....It's really not what I anticipated hearing about it after all of those years. I am a huge fan of all vampire shows/movies so thought I would really like this. I thought it would be much more...idk....dramatic? being on HBO.... But the cheese factor is off the charts. The Vampire Diaries even being on the CW is a much better show. There is basically no storyline in this show. It feels like a different set of people wrote each episode and had never seen or heard of past episodes. At least with TVD, each season has a distinct storyline that each episode progresses. This is just a total mess. Giving it three stars though because while I don't LOVE it, I don't actually HATE it either. I have made it in about 17 episodes and plan to continue on. But I also find myself playing with my phone and missing scenes where as in TVD, my eyes were glued to the screen.",1485043200,2,902,4.34319526627219
3574635,1,B001FB4W0W,"A shallow over reliance on constant sex and nudity. The idea of the story was intriguing but rarely ever explored. There's more nudity and sex in this show than there are vampires. I'd wager that even Game of Thrones has less T&A.

I went into the show expecting a dark, interesting story line that embraced its potential and didn't hold back. What I got instead was effectively a porno with a vampire theme. Very disappointed.

I don't have a problem with sexuality or nudity at all, and sexuality and seduction can be a big part of a vampire show. Obviously. Unfortunately some shows lean on it as a crutch. This show, however, has no legs to begin with. It only has crutches.",1485043200,2,678,4.549180327868853

I couldn't make it through the first episode. The acting was soo poor. The words the actors spoke were lacking depth. With all of the other like series, I don't believe I missed out by skipping this one. I don't understand the love affair most have had with this series. Although Dexter is not related to this kind of vampire genre, it is probably hard for someone like me to go from the masterpiece of Dexter to this vapid series.

3575883,3,B001FB4W0W,I have to say the enjoyment of the show is how cheeseball some of the characters and scenes are.  Watched because I liked the idea of TRUE BLOOD and having a vampire society outted but really that's all secondary to the soap opera drama.  Kind of like a DARK SHADOWS for this generation is what I would classify it as.  Even with all the hoky-ness of the show there are some great surprises like TARA... she won the show for me.  Let's see how many seasons I can handle.,1483315200,,470,4.247191011235955

I just started season 2 and so much cussing...I don't know if I will be able to continue to watch because of this. It would still be a great show if they didnot cuss.

(Twighlight), (Vampire Diaries) ect.. she is only 10 but she's mature enough for those I mentioned. TruBlood is absolutely NOT appropriate for children, or even teens for that matter. I was not expecting it to be so graphic.. so my daughter was pretty disappointed that she wouldn't get to binge watch 7 seasons of TruBlood with me. Just a heads up to parents out there.

I was struck by how well it has held up even with lots of contemporary (at that time) cultural references, but as good as it was starting out, it got even better in seasons 2 and 3.

As more and more people find obout it , the novelty wears off .
Of course, that didn't happen until 10 other similar shows began to appear the tube, for me I that didn't happen until Season 5 .
This is brilliantly cast show with actors that are fully capable of becoming what their character demands . The writers go well enough a job but the actors bring those words to life , that might have been a faux pa considering the subject matter , lol !
You will binge watch the season and it will have been Sunday by the time you realize that your Saturday night was stolen by these creatures of the night ! You will love it.  I guarantee it !!",1481241600,,804,4.187096774193549

3578526,3,B001FB4W0W,"Great show the first couple of seasons, but if you are a TRUE Sookie Stackhouse fan, don't expect this to follow Charlaine's book series. It quickly veers away after this first season. Once you get to seasons 4 and on, it's very hard to even find resemblance between the books and the TV series at all, and that's kind of hard to swallow as a true Sookie fan.
Great vampire/shifter/ werewolf show on it's own, maybe if it had been about Sookie's cousin Hadley it would have been easier to watch and not so disappointing when a character moved sooooo far away from what Charlaine had built the character to be in the book series.
I'll still watch it, more for the supporting characters that I enjoy instead of being disappointed by the main characters.....",1478649600,,755,4.6

3579758,3,B001FB4W0W,"A few years back friends were all taken by storm when True Blood was released and insisted I should watch it. I also found this show by accident, just browsing Prime content. I can't say that I like it, nor that I don't. Usually, I don't feel this ambiguous. Either I like it or not. It must be a satire about vampires because some of the scenes and characters are ridiculous, but entertaining at the same time. My review may not be very helpful, but I really don't know what to make of this show. Some of the characters are way too stereotypical. Blonde damsel, good girl virgin; really? Seems like the ""Pulp Fiction"" of vampires.",1475280000,,631,4.448275862068965
3579759,3,B001FB4W0W,"It's entertaining enough that I don't turn it off, but Vampire Diaries...SO MUCH BETTER! The characters in True Blood do not ""match"" as they should.
I get it they're in the ""deep south"" so ruggedly handsome guys and country home girls, such as Anna Paquin with her southern drawl and the gap in her teeth, are the type they're heading toward. But honestly, Bill Compton doesn't seem her type AT ALL. He looks more like her father which makes some scenes hard to watch.
Jason and Laffayette carry the whole show, thank goodness. Sam and Jessica and Eric are pretty good too.
It's unfortunate for such great actors to be stuck in a plot that's kinda tired and not very well put together. Everything just seems so random. There's no familiarity to tie all the episodes and events to atimeliness all the episodes seem just thrown in there somewhere.
Not Anna Paquin's fault though. She does the best she can, for a girl who's a lifelong Virgin and goes from that to a fang banging slut in love with her ""dad""? Kinda gross guys! They just font match! And, poor Tara. The accent is WAYYY overdone, and her character is fire er stuck on the sidelines,u know, just barely a part of the game, yet she supposedly has a leading role?

3580219,5,B001FB4W0W,"The gorgeous hunk of male anatomy, Alexander Skarsgrd, (who plays Eric Northman) is one of the best possible reasons to watch True Blood Season 1.  Heck, he is the reason to watch it the entire show.  I love his character, his voice, his snarky lines and that perfect bod.

The show is quirky and clever.  Ryan Kwanten plays Jason Stackhouse and he is brilliant in this role.  He plays a womanizing, ""dumb as a box of hair"" pretty boy with a big heart. His dumb quotes and actions are a hysterical throughout the entire series.",1473465600,,527,4.505263157894737

She acts like an airhead idiot constantly- mouthing off to vampires (for little to no reason), running off into dangerous situations without thinking, screaming at every little thing etc. In the books, Sookie is a strong, smart woman who sticks to what she thinks is right (regardless of her romantic situation) AND kicks the occasional butt. It might not irritate people if they haven't read the books though..

A little too much for me. But then I think this changes down the road. I like that it feels like a real experience I mean they really thought of everything .. TV shows,politics and so on. The show has deep meanings that are nice. I also don't understand why all the men are at least double the age of the women in this show. Again I am only in the beginning so things might change.

A girl at work said it's pretty good after the first episode.
I don't think they got the right girl for Sookie...or she was just directed wrong.
When Bill is in the bar they didn't do those scenes right. She was trying too hard...to be sexual or whatever...it was awkward and odd. how the camera was so close to her face ...was awkward too.
If I thought she was better as sookie..I'd probably be more into it...she might get better. I'll try to watch more at some point...",1470096000,,536,4.37

If you don't have an accent then don't say the words slower just so that it seems like you do have the accent.

They are in small town Louisiana trying to grasp the idea that Vampires are real and have ""come out of the coffin""  LOL.  Its not a deep thought provoking show but it is fun to watch and mind numbing if you need that. Some of the characters are adorable, like the red headed waitress  Arlene, so over the top!  Shes wonderful and funny and some of her lines are priceless!  The best part of the entire series is Alexander Skarsgard!  What a yummy character he plays.  Love Eric and his side kick Pam played by Kristin Bauer van Straten, shes wonderful and funny!  So yes... please give it a try.

3581852,5,B001FB4W0W,"Great take on the vampire genre as they are recognized as people, and live among humans. The vampires must follow guidelines and not feed on humans- thus drinking True Blood. There are many vampires that need to feed on humans, and religious groups opposed to vampires. I truly enjoyed Anna Paquin (academy award winner) as Sookie Stackhouse, the girl who falls in love with a vampire. She and her brother Jason get into all sorts of trouble in a small town in Louisiana. This is a great 1st season, and I binge watched in 2 days. Even though we live among vampires, they can annihilate us at any given time. Great supporting cast with Steven Moyer as Bill, Rutina Wesley as Tara, Ryan Kwanten as Jason, Alexander Skarsgard as Eric, and Nelsan Ellis as Lafayette who is incredible.",1465948800,,781,4.666666666666667

Even Eric - Wow what a big boy - Alexander Skarsgard plays a wonderful part as a very large Vampire not to be reckoned with.

3582148,2,B001FB4W0W,"I'm barely even started with season 2 and I already can't stand to watch any more of this. It's really, truly despicable.

For the sake of transparency, there will be spoilers in this review, and it will be a review of everything I've seen of the show, not just season one. I don't seem to have a way to review the show as a whole as far as Amazon's review process goes, so I'm just putting my review at the beginning.

At first, I thought this was going to be an inventive new take on the vampire-romance genre, and it seemed clever the way they were basically using the vampire race and human society's reaction thereto as a way to show people how foolish and needlessly hateful they're behaving when it comes to certain groups of people (gays, blacks, etc) with whose existence our society is currently struggling. For that, I give it props. At first, I even found it refreshing the way the religious community was being portrayed - namely that it was calling attention to the refusal of self-accountability and infantilization which are so prevalent amongst religious people. Not to mention, they've got some great nudity (but then with HBO, could we really expect any less?) But the fun stops there in my case. This show quickly turned into a real buzz-kill and and eye-rollingly prototypical mainstream stupid-fest.

Where to begin? One of the foremost things I find truly lamentable about this show is the childish ""evil satan worshipping pagan cult"" plot crutch. The way that our society has come to view pagan cultures and deities is wrong. Religion has engineered these caricatures of paganism for us to believe, not because they're anywhere close to realistic, but because it benefits religion and makes people easier to control and keeps them closed-minded to more life-affirming ideologies. Shame on these writers for perpetuating these ages-old lies just to make a buck! Aside from the tired childishness of maligning pagan culture and philosophy, there's the fact that it's painfully unoriginal. It's the easiest thing in the world to do, and no one will question it. No one with a very loud or influential public voice, that is. Now, if you wrote a story about baby-eating, blood-drinking, human-sacrificng jews who were out to destroy the world and used all the stereotypes and lies that have ever been told about *them* as plot devices, you'd have the pants sued off of you. ""Blood libel! Antisemitism! Discrimination!"" they'd all be shouting. There would be loud protests outside your studios and the jewish defense league would have your backside in a sling. But the pagans? Oh, who cares! Nobody's gonna stand up for them. It's nothing but a cop-out from writing an original and thoughtful plot... Disgusting. Shameful and disgusting.

In related news about this show, there's the not-so-subtle brainwashing tactics. ""Why Val, what *ever* do you mean?"" Before you dismiss me as a tinfoil-helmet-wearer, pay attention to the character MaryAnn Forrester. She's the handmaiden of Dionysos, whom the show's dialogue is fairly quick to synonimize with the christian devil. That in and of itself is just plain inexcusable, but it's not my main point. MaryAnn makes a point that ""control is just a cage that this stupid culture uses to lock-away who we really are,"" and that's a very good point. We *do* live in a culture whose authorities (religious and secular) seek to control us and stifle our vitality for their own benefit. Of course, MaryAnn is a main antagonist, so we're naturally inclined to hate and fear her. Isn't it obvious? Having her be the only one who's pointing these things out is a method of creating associations in people's minds between these sorts of ideas, and evil (or at least an imminent threat to society and their own well-being.) Because that character is trying to bring our society crashing down in a blur of drunken sado-masochistic debauchery and vandalism, most people will hear her encourage life-affirming philosophies and practices, and conclude that such things must therefore lead to armageddon. It's brainwashing, pure and simple. It's a way to ensure that anyone who might otherwise be willing to question mainstream thought gets quickly sucked back into the self-defeating status-quo. All sorts of TV shows are doing this, but that's a problem, not an excuse. If you think I'm being unreasonable, you need to consider that most people are extremely eager to conform to their surroundings as a survival mechanism. To some extent, it's our nature to adapt to our surroundings. And when we're exposed to things like these throughout our lives, you can bet your bottom dollar that their message sticks with us, whether it's good for us or not. This is especially true when it comes to television, which causes us to ""zone-out"" and enter a purely-receptive sort of ""trance."" This is actually a physiological fact, and you can look it up if you don't believe me. While you're sitting in front of the TV for at least an hour at a time, you're seeing and feeling, not thinking and questioning. Why do you think TV advertising is so effective?

Then you have the fact that it's religious methodology that they use to counter MaryAnn's powers. When Tara is under MaryAnn's ""spell"" and acting all out of control with the pitch-black eyes and such, her Jesus-junkie mother starts quoting scripture and saying prayers at her. After all the time this show spent highlighting the hypocrisy of religion and religious people (Tara's mother being one of the foremost examples of which) I was expecting better. But no, apparently we're all supposed to get the message here that no matter how backwards, impotent, ignorant and socially-destructive religion may be, we'd all better keep believing because we're all just one pagan-cult away from eternal damnation and only the power of Jesus that can save us. Bloody pathetic! If I wanted to be re-indoctrinated, I'd go back to church. And then LaFayette joins-in with her nonsense, and when she looks at him all shocked that a gay man knows scripture, he says ""What? Jesus and I agreed to see other people, but that don't mean we don't still talk."" Yup - calling all gays! Time to come back to the religion that calls you an abomination! (sarcasm.)

For every potentially socially helpful element of this show, there are two more that come straight from the damn dark-ages. I just can't deal with it, no matter how many attractive naked people you show me.",1463961600,,6444,4.9181985294117645

But True Blood popped up on my Amazon recommended list, and I gave it a try.  I was quickly hooked, and now I have to limit myself, or I'd sit in front of the tv and watch it straight through to the last of the 7th season!  There's so much going on!  The series has a lot of humor and drama, and such relate-able characters, even though half of them are not quite human.  I love that each new episode picks up right where the last one left off, so it's like one long movie, rather than a bunch of separate stand-alone shows.",1462924800,2,638,4.112903225806452

3582386,5,B001FB4W0W,"True Blood is a favorite of our family, and has been since its premiere. Great acting, and a really good story line until about season 6. Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer have great chemistry. They stick very closely with The Sookie Stackhouse Novels, and then it falls off around midway through season 6, but we still love it. Season 1-5 are good enough to warrant a 5 star review.",1462147200,,379,4.507246376811594

3582448,4,B001FB4W0W,"I like the show. Its addictive.  Its corny at times but the writing is good. The stories are fresh with a def climactic ending for the season. I gave it 4 stars just because its hokie and def holes in the plot sometimes, mostly the sudden change in a character's mind or opinion because its convenient to the story. there is an incredible cast and actors develop their characters well. But the damn fake fangs! They're supposed to be the canine teeth, not the ones in front. It looks like cheap Halloween teeth you'd buy at party city for your costume! The actors even seem to struggle with them at times, being too close to the front of their mouths. It just looks awkward, especially the Jessica character. The show Could be more in an age where tv shows are popular when they make cool sexy Calvin Clein vampires. Someone shoot the Hair and Makeup or costume person! All in all, though, a fun show which leaves a cliff hangers that will keep you coming back for more to see what happens in the next episode. Good writing guys! You'll definitely fall in love with the small town setting and want to grab a drink at Merlotte's. Oh, and there's a lot of good looking people always (always) getting it on in the nude, if you're in the mood... just sayin' ",1461628800,,1254,4.424242424242424

3582507,1,B001FB4W0W,I thought it would be an awesome series and I was really into it until Sookie cheats on her Vampire man the first chance she gets in the second to the last episode of the first season. Sookie and Bob seemed like they had a real connection until that cheating scene and that killed the rest of the first season for me.

Back in 2008, I now realize what I desperately wanted were vampires that didn't twinkle in the sun and look like models posing in Calvin Klein ads (you know who you are).  I even watched the whole True Blood series the first time around even after they had jumped the shark several times, I was that loyal of a fan.  Second time around, the bad acting, ridiculous scripts, and general silliness of the show became all too apparent. To take great liberty with Thomas Wolfe's words, ""You can't watch this again.""

If you were to just explain TB to someone who had never seen it, it would come off as silly, and it does anyways in some places.

The performances were good, especially Anna Paquin as Sookie. I will say that the sex and violence are quite graphic and put me off a bit at first but I got used to it (for the most part).

3582808,5,B001FB4W0W,"I have wanted for years to see how the TV adaptation compared to the books from which it was adapted: the Sookie Stackhouse: Southern Vampire Mystery books by Charlaine Harris. Unfortunately, I don't get HBO. I've found that I am often unimpressed when I see books I enjoyed made into movies or TV shows, and I loved the SVM. Okay, I wasn't too fond of books 11 and 12, and loathed 13, which was written as though the author totally forgot who her characters were. Still...
  Recently, I discovered that my Prime membership gave me access to seasons 1-5 (of 7) of ""Tru Blood."" Wonderful! There are definitely differences between the books and TV adaptation, but I've really enjoyed the show none-the-less. I planned on watching 2 episodes at most the first evening. I ended up binge-watching 11 of the 12 episodes, and had to force myself to shut down the computer and go to bed...and only when I realized it was after 2 a.m. The TV characters have depth, the writing is much better than I expected for a ""vampire show"" and the special effects are fun. You don't need to have read the books to enjoy the TV show. If you have, you'll have to decide for yourself how the differences between books and show make you feel; I don't want to put any spoilers here for those who plan to watch. Just be prepared: this was an HBO series. If you have problems with nudity, graphic sex scenes and lots of profanity...well, you might want to consider another show. If not, it's a fun ride.",1456012800,4,1476,4.503731343283582

3582916,4,B001FB4W0W,I really like this series. It is well written and has some humor. They do use the F word gratuitously and way too much. If it weren't for that I would have given it 5 stars.

3582931,1,B001FB4W0W,"This is absolutely the worst interpretation of vampires I have ever had the displeasure of watching, and with the advent of Twilight, well, suffice it to say there have been quite a few stink bombs amongst that number. Granted, I am not familiar with the books this series is based on, but the prospect of finding a tinge of darkness and horror in a vampire series again had me inordinately excited. I enjoy everything from old school Anne Rice, P.N. Elrod, vampires in Victorian literature, as straight up figures of horror or portrayed as something of a protagonist - but this... ugh. It was sad to see how vampire lore has not only been twisted here, but perverted beyond the realms of conceiveability, and, if that were not enough, HBO has taken it upon itself to peddle soft-core porn and racial hatred.

Because the vampires in this program and the location (deep south) are being used as an allegory for the civil rights movement, therefore white skin + not a vampire = ""racist"". If you are of European descent and are fine with that, check your B12 levels, because your brain appears to have shrunken to the size of a walnut.

In short, this program is everything I despise about television - the selling of sex, bad dialogue, spoon-feeding ideological standpoints, the blurring of good vs. evil, and insult to injury, it was a horrific, painfully acted butchering of all things vampiric. And only reinforces the decision to disconnect my cable years ago, because this is proof positive I have not been missing much.",1454803200,7,1524,4.768939393939394

I don't always understand the significance of some of the scenes/shots (especially the ones that add nothing to the storyline). But overall the story isn't bad ( I hope it continues to get better).

What did impress me, however, was the excellent acting despite the dubious southern accents.  Not a serious series, and yet the occasional ""pearls of wisdom"" tossed in are pleasant and thought provoking.  Family loyalty is prominent and, boy howdy, do those people drink, take drugs and have sex.  And dance occasionally.  Lots of blood splashed around and bare butts/breasts are occasionally featured.  Lots of allegories for those of us who keep up with the news.  We will continue watching.",1454544000,3,621,4.970873786407767

3583082,5,B001FB4W0W,When True Blood was first on tv I never missed an episode.  When the dvd's were avail I bought the sets.  And now I enjoy popping in on occasion to see a favorite episode on Amazon.,1454112000,,181,4.0
3583083,1,B001FB4W0W,"First of all, I am not a fan of the Charlene Harris books. I read the first one and was mildly amused, but did not think much of it. They based the series on those books, which have titles like dead until dark or something.  I'm not sure why I bothered to finish the season. It filled time that needed to be filled, but it's not good. I know it has a big fan base, so somebody must like it.  But I certainly did not. Enough with the vampire crap already. It's almost as bad as the Zombie crap now. If you like light entertainment, that does not challenge you at all,  with no real characterization or meaning, if you just want action and pretty people to look at, you may in fact like this. If you're looking for anything deeper, keep moving. Find something else. Jessica Jones is pretty good.  Game of Thrones is pretty good, if a bit of a downer.  Orange is the new black, if you're not prejudiced against lesbians, is really good.  Downtown Abbey is good.  If you want Jane Austin, find a good adaptation of one of her books into a movie. Try pride and prejudice or Emma. Now that is worth the time of someone who's got any sort of above normal intelligence.  This show is not.",1454112000,,1180,4.236607142857143

The acting was horrendous. Special effects horrendous. Plot, or rather lack there of, nonexistent. And the accents....my family is from LA and none of them talk like that. The people on this show sounded like they were trying too hard to sound redneck. Made me cringe listening to them.

So I didn't watch it again till about the fourth season and I tried it again from the beginning. I was hooked after the first episode and binged watched this show till I caught up to the new season at the time! I fell in love with this show. I love most of the characters, Lafeyette, Eric and Pam are great. They are so snarky they are funny. I think I had a love and hate relationship with the character Bill there were some episodes I liked him and other times I wanted him to go away! I got really involved with this series and had to watch it till the very end! I became a huge fan of this series and even read the book after I watched the shows. And I couldn't get into the books at all!! If you have tried this before and didn't like it give this show another shot! Its totally worth it and the further you get into the series the better it will get! And for the record the guys on this show are smoking hot! Eric the vampire is insane and you can't get enough of him! I even thought the guy who played Sam Merlotte was handsome as hell!! This is a great show!!",1451952000,,1174,3.936974789915966

If they are going to treat you to the benefits of prime they should at least give you the complete series.  Overall, once you get over the hyper sexual nature of the series it could be quiet addictive to watch. I'm giving it less than five because I'm annoyed about not getting the complete series on prime.

Update (Spoiler)
Although I was totally annoyed that the complete series was not included in the prime membership I have changed my rating to a five based on the conclusion of the series which to me was perfect because it left combined feelings unexpectedness  finality, sadness, and ultimately resigned happiness despite the inevitable end of the relationship between Sookie and Bill.",1449014400,,775,4.768656716417911

3583267,3,B001FB4W0W,"Not something to go into with any hype surrounding it...certainly doesn't stand up to any hype.  This is essentially another cheesy, vampire/human combo deal with some other monsters occasionally surfacing.  The show is almost 100% dedicated to its romance between a human (sort of) and vampire and it's really not all that interesting or captivating.  The show is at its best when gruesome or funny and at its worst when it takes its romance so seriously and when it's explaining things with dialogue which gets more and more boring as the show goes on.  The dialogue issue doesn't affect Season 1 as much as following seasons that go further into the vampire lore (which, it turns out, is drop-dead, boring stuff).",1448841600,,716,4.892561983471074

Sometimes the main plot is more boring than the subplots which led to my decision of not finishing the series. Gave it 3 stars because it was interesting but after 2 seasons no character was really improving.,1447891200,,377,4.815384615384615

But if you don't mind stuff like that (personally I don't at all) then yeah. The characters in the first season are a little 2 dimensional, but of course you're still kinda learning the world.

It's got drama (lots of it), romance (a peculiar love story), horror (monsters, blood & gore), sex (about as far as soft porn can go), suspense, comedy (here and there), social commentary (vampires play the role of undocumented immigrants), and action (the usual vampire stuff and violence a la 'Underworld').

3583538,1,B001FB4W0W,"I love fantasy stories.  I love vampires.  I love boobs.  But this show somehow manages to take all of the above, mix it together, and turn it into something awful.  0 stars if it were an option.  If you must watch it, watch it with the volume off and make up your own plot and dialogue; it'll be much better.
None of the characters are sympathetic.  All of them are the worst stereo types you can imagine for their race and economic status.
The obvious intended analogy between the show's Vampire Rights Movement and real life rights movements is insulting, because the vampires actually are as bad, even worse, than the 'bigots' think; even the 'good' vampires are prolific serial killers, and the rest are just pure monsters.
The cars are cool, though.  They found a really good collection of iconic vehicles from the 60's through the 80's, and then somehow expect you to believe a bunch of no-income, no-autophilia nobodies are able to afford and maintain them.  The lead character, a waitress, drives a mint condition 83 civic 3 door; the bar owner has a mint condition 67 bronco; the two desperate and broke drug addicts drive a $30,000 TR6; the cook/drug dealer/prostitute has a 80's Mercedes SL; the trio of vampires has a 76 lincoln 2 door; etc.",1445558400,2,1254,4.668181818181818

3583925,5,B001FB4W0W,"I like the True Blood series. This isn't intended to be a spoiler and is purely my opinion but it's too obvious the series is about prejudices against the gay community. An example, the vampires came ""out of the coffin"" when True Blood was invented.  They're considered non human/sub human and they're fighting for equal rights and the right to marry humans.  There are lots of other ingredients thrown into the mix which make for a fascinating and almost addictive story line.  If you believe in God you'll want to stay on your guard over some of the premises the writers propose.  You see them challenge ""truth"" but they also show how those challenges fall apart but you just need to know not to take what's stated to be what's meant.",1441497600,,736,4.595419847328245

3583973,5,B001FB4W0W,First time seeing this show. I particularly don't like the vampire/zombie hype that's been going around for a while now. This show does give more than just drama and brings a certain level of history that make it interesting. The main character development is not given more weight than supporting. Overall great plot and story progression in my opinion. Looking forward to learn how this show interprets vampires and the supernatural,1441065600,,434,5.126760563380282

This show is an exploitive, redundant, inane trite piece of garbage.

3584557,5,B001FB4W0W,"Just watched series one of True Blood, eight years after it was produced.  Have read all the Sookie Stackhouse series, books from which the television drama was adapted.  Skookie, played by Anna Paquin (the only actress I had any previous exposure to), was an inspired choice.  She somehow manages to express Skokie's innocence and compassion while still conveying her intelligence and resilience, as well as her sustained trauma from a lifetime of listening to and trying to tune out the psychic chatter of the people that surround her.  Unfortunately, Skookie eventually becomes unlikable, despite the actress' skill, because the writer's have her doing so many inexplicable and contradictory things.  Skookie, for instance, would never flirt with Sam while Bill is off being tried by vampire court for staking and killing a vampire who almost killed her.  The amiable and fundamentally decent Sam Merlotte is portrayed well.  Spookie's gran makes a brief appearance, and is appealing as a wise and unconditionally loving elder.  Sookie's brother, Jason, the semi-repugnant, half-bright womanizer and party boy is also well acted, but his character is made central in the drama, unlike the books in which he was a secondary figure, and his character really doesn't sustain enough interest to justify the attention.  His sociopathic, hippy dippy girl friend, Amy, lost little rich girl, is well developed and acted. Sookie's childhood friend, Tara, is completely transformed into a black girl with a chip on her shoulder which conceals her heart of gold.  She plays a parallel role to Sookie, a n d I liked her a lot, although the theme of demon possession is overplayed.  Her cousin, Lafayette, is the short order cook at Merlotte's, in addition to being an entrepreneur who markets his best assessts, and was one of my favorites, but he looses much of his sweetness after being abducted and tortured by Eric.  Bill is a complex character, who exhibits the best and most human side of Vampire's as a race (& vampires at their best isn't all that great), and his role is ably played.  The choice for Eric was excellent, although he doesn't make much of an appearance in season one.  The question as to just why Sookie makes such a tremendous effort to befriend Vampire's is inevitably raised much sooner in the television drama than it is the books.  Human's come off poorly, and Vamp's are even worse.  There is very little demonstrable substance to justify Sookie's blind faith in vampires.  I am looking forward to watching ice-cold and sardonic Eric presumably ""fall in love"" (or whatever passes for that with vampires) with Sookie is season two.  Pam, Erik's delightfully cold and bitchy second, should prove interesting in season two as well.  And don't worry, when given half a chance by the show 's writer's, the actress playing Sookie renders Sookie likable and appealing again in short order.  Over all, a strong and interesting production.",1437782400,3,2951,5.045360824742268

3584623,4,B001FB4W0W,"Good take on the vampire genre; much better than what's available on commercial TV.  A lot of interesting and varied characters and, of course, a lot more supernatural creatures than just vampires.

The gist: ""Tru Blood"" is a synthetic blood that allows vampires to not have to feed on humans; after it's release, vampires ""come out"" and try to integrate with society at large.  In the first season, ""Bill the vampire"" comes back to the town he lived in during the Civil War era to claim his now unoccupied home (his last descendant has passed); the house is conveniently near the home of Sookie Stackhouse (the main character, and the name of the books the show is based on).

We get a glimpse of vampire laws and hierarchies, along with the typically human nature of vampires who don't want to integrate; there are politics of ""equality"" that parallel some real present day movements (marriage between vampire and human, for example); intolerance on both sides, and of course, a lot of sneaky, underhanded actions by characters with dubious intentions.

Drug use is also one of the main themes, with humans taking ""V"" (vampire blood) for the rush it gives them: heightened sex drive, shared visions and experiences - it's different depending on user and vampire the blood came from.

A lot of death, a lot of sex, a lot of very funny moments - my wife and I really enjoy it.",1437436800,4,1376,4.7125

3584692,4,B001FB4W0W,"I enjoy the show, but you can see where some of the actors are just getting into the characters.  I feel the writing is good and that Sookie is being shown as a naive southern girl, not sure if that was the goal.  There are some spots where it drags with the plot, though it has not deterred me from continuing to watch.  I just finished season 1 and am looking forward to season 2 and seeing how the characters evolve.",1436745600,,419,4.148148148148148

3584695,5,B001FB4W0W,This is one of my all time favorites.  I have missed Charlene Harris's Sookie Stackhouse books.  Always so great and never disappointing.  I hated to see it end.  As a lifetime fan of Vampire films this fleshed out and humanized the Vampire culture.  I can't recommend this enough it is pure cotton candy though at times a bit graphic but then Vampires have never been about Martha Stewart.  I'm loving getting acquainted with each season and renewing memories.  So great.....,1436745600,,476,4.875

I do not understand how anyone would watch this junk for 7-8  full seasons! I love supernatural movies and shows, but this one is not worth watching. We tried to give it a chance even though we were constantly shaking our heads in annoyance after each episode. Aside from Lafayette and Sookie, the characters are totally unlikeable, there is WAY too much graphic sex and nudity which makes it feel like a porno, and the plots and subplots are all laughable or annoying.

3584871,5,B001FB4W0W,Great show but I think that the amount of sex scenes distracts from the show.,1435363200,,77,4.2
3584872,5,B001FB4W0W,"I was reluctant to watch this as I thought it was going to be another silly tweener, girly vampire romance story. Ya I was wrong. Sure it's got the romance in it, a bit anyway, but it is way more than that. Good dark humor, blood and sexy as hell! I like the idea of a country recognizing vampires as real and living among us. A nice alternate reality. The acting is better than expected as well. I wasn't expecting much, but gotta lot more.
I recomend this for a good binge watching day.",1435363200,,488,4.202127659574468
3584873,1,B001FB4W0W,"True Blood seems to be a show made up entirely of drama club rejects; the acting is just awful. I'm okay with some creative license to what vampires' true weaknesses and strengths are, but you go too far when staking a vampire results in him projectile vomiting blood everywhere. Disgusting and unnecessary.
Additionally, this show is wildly disrespectful to women and uses excessive vulgar language.",1435363200,,400,5.1692307692307695

8301673,5,B001FB4W0W,"I purchased this used at a ridiculously low price, so I didn't expect it to be in good quality, or even for all the discs to work. But when I got it the box looked barely touched and all discs played perfectly. Very happy.",1526428800,,222,4.068181818181818
8301674,1,B001FB4W0W,I honestly do not understand the big deal with this show when it was still playing on HBO. A lot of my friends were into this so I decided to watch a few episodes to give it a try. I'm not particularly super into vampire flicks except for a few from the 90's and 2000's. But I simply could not get into this show at all.  The entire premise is odd even for something fictional. Also did not like any of the characters either. Had a hard time getting through the first several episodes waiting it to get entertaining for me.,1526169600,,523,4.178217821782178

8301678,5,B001FB4W0W,this was an excellent series what else can I say,1525219200,,48,3.9
