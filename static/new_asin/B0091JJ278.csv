5241900,5,B0091JJ278,my second order did not process at all. i was not charged either. The reply I received from you was misunderstood when I questioned the order?,1356220800,,142,4.5
5241901,5,B0091JJ278,"As I went to post this review of the recently released DVD, I noted there were already 83 other reviews posted. In one of the quirks of Amazon's review posting system, the reviews here mostly relate to the CD version and go back almost nine years. So, before basing your purchase on reviews, I always recommend that you sort the reviews by ""Most recent"" and then look at the date the review was posted. With that said.....

I'm so thrilled that this film is now available to those who remember seeing it first on ABC TV in 1971 - it was the first animated film made specifically for television! - and teachers who will want to use this in their classes. Based on a fable written by pop singer/composer, the late Harry Nilsson, for which Nilsson wrote seven songs (the best known one being ""Me and My Arrow""; Arrow is the name of the lead character's dog), the 74-minute animated film was directed and animated by Fred Wolf, with Ringo Star as the ""narrator"" and features voice-over actors like Paul Frees.

The simple plot tells the story of a small boy - Oblio - who lives in the Land of Point, where everyone has a pointed head. The problem is that Oblio's head is round. He is ostracized by everyone in LoP and is sent packing, along with his dog, the aforementioned Arrow. By the end of the film we find out that being different physically does not mean we are different inside and the message is universal.

The film was made before the computer age of animation so it required over 20,000 hand drawn and colored cells. Don't expect it too look like a Disney or Pixar film; it's closer to the Beatle's animated ""Yellow Submarine"".

This new DVD version - titled the ""Definitive Collector's Edition"" - adds 25 minutes of ""bonus material"": A new documentary featuring Nilsson's widow and her two children, Monty Python member (and animator) Terry Gilliam, Monkee Mickey Dolenz and Nilsson's estate lawyer. There is a lengthy ""conversation"" with animator/director Wolf which is enlightening, though his ego gets in the way when he spends time dissing the woman who was first hired to write the full script. And, the lawyer tells a great story about how Nilsson got ABC to fund the film's production.

As I write this, Christmas is coming and I can't think of a better way to share the story and moral of ""The Point"" than this new DVD release.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5241944,5,B0091JJ278,"This is a very sweet animated movie I remember from the seventies. The story in the movie is a book that a father is reading to his son, who'd rather be watching television, but finally settles down to listen to his father's story and imagine the setting and characters for himself. It's animation style accentuates a child's simple, but sometimes confused point of view; it features memorable songs written and performed by Harry Nilsson and Ringo Starr's soothing British voice tells the story of little Oblio, a child born without a point of his own in a town where everyone and everything was expected to have one (the people all have pointed heads) and where the primary industry was making them. SPOILER ALERT? I'm not sure that this movie can really be 'spoiled' but I'm going to outline the entire plot in this review. I think that most people who would be interested in buying it have probably already seen it somewhere else, as it's not very well known. The movie is very charming and sweet, and while the plot tries to create some mild suspense and people seem somewhat cavalier about banishing a very young boy into the forest, I doubt anyone has ever been surprised that nothing at all truly bad happens in it and everything is set right in the end.

Oblio and his pointed dog, Arrow, are quite well liked by everyone, except the Duke, and his son, who manage to use an obscure law to have poor Oblio banished to the Pointless Forest. Everyone in town, including the King, regrets not standing up for Oblio and not questioning a law that they all come to agree was a bad one. For his part Oblio manages to remain cheerful and doesn't seem to blame anyone, even the villainous, manipulative Duke, or his snotty son. After a very short journey through the Pointless Forest, during which he encounters several quite bizarre creatures and puzzling characters, Oblio returns to the village to be welcomed back by everyone in the village, who are all relieved at his safe return and for the chance to stand up for him, except, of course, the Duke and his son.

The Duke, like any villain would, tries to insist that Oblio doesn't belong in the Village and have him thrown back out, but Oblio insists that he has something important to say and the Duke is told to be quiet so he can speak. Oblio announces that he has discovered that nearly everything in the so-called 'Pointless Forest' seems to have a point, except for the one person there who's constantly pointing, and that he has realized that everyone has a point - even himself. The King says that Oblio, ""has a point,"" but the Duke removes Oblio's cap to prove that he doesn't, only to reveal that Oblio has grown a point. Somehow, the shock of seeing that Oblio has a point causes the Duke, and then everyone else in the Village to lose their own points and the movie ends with everyone cheerfully getting used to the idea that even though they no longer have pointed heads they all still have a point. Oblio is reunited with his family and presumably they all live happily ever after.

My grandchildren enjoyed it, and asked to watch it again. Even the adults all agreed they liked it. Everything about the movie is mild and simplistic, but it still manages to be fun and the songs are quite good. The Movie, of course has 'a point', which is that no matter how different someone might appear to be they still deserve to be treated with respect and that everyone matters, or 'has a point'. I highly recommend it to anyone with kids or grand kids. It's certainly much better than a lot of the low-budget children's animation available.",1486944000,3,3601,4.588509316770186

If you have never seen the film, do.  it is a story of a little boy born into a world where everyone and everything has a point, quite literally.  Except him.  He is born with a round head and then banished to the ""pointless forest"".  There he runs into all types of folks, many without a point and quickly finds that you don't have to have a point to have a point.

SYNOPSIS--
Obleo is born with an obvious deformity: his head is rounded instead of being pointy, like all others are in the town. Although his neighbors pity Obleo, the local Count and son ask the king to banish this boy as ""he has no point."" Obleo and faithful pooch Arrow are sent to the pointless forest, despite everyone's sadness at their leaving.

Obleo encounters in his wanderings several interesting folks and he learns from them that you're not necessarily pointless simply because you don't have a point. He returns home with this revelation and something quite remarkable occurs at the town meeting that Obleo attends.

This is a movie about acceptance and the need for us all to stand up for things that are wrong even if it's not happening to us personally. The Point was written a few decades ago however it address issues that are totally relevant to today's times. It's filled with an all cast of voices like Ringo Starr and Marlo Thomas. It is funny on an adult level yet appealing to kids since it is a cartoon. The songs I believe, are some of the best ever written.

The answer: none more cool. `The Point' is the Holy Grail of animated films in many ways, a long-lost feature from the early 1970s that played a huge role in my personal development as a child. Legendary singer/songwriter Harry Nilsson conceived of `The Point' and crafted an almost impossibly good soundtrack - seriously, any all-time Top Ten lists that omit `Me And My Arrow' should be dismissed immediately - while animation superstar Fred Wolf (`Puff The Magic Dragon', `Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles') both directed the film and oversaw an immensely talented crew that brought the film to life. Now, thanks to the good folks at MVD Visual, `The Point' is available as a `definitive collector's edition', with both the visual and audio aspects restored and remastered to perfection, for a whole new generation of kids to discover. The film itself is a story within a story, whereby a caring father (voiced by Ringo Starr of The Beatles) reads to his young son (voiced by Mike Lookinland, aka Bobby on TV's `The Brady Bunch') the tale of a young boy named Oblio (also voiced by Lookinland) who is the first person born without a point on his head in a village centered around the fact that everything has - literally - a point. Oblio is discharged from the village after an altercation with the son of an important (and evil) figure in the local government, and makes his way - with his trusty, and pointy, dog, Arrow - through the Pointless Forest, where he encounters all sorts of things and people and creatures that are strange and new to him. The journey, naturally, has a point. And that is the point of the film: that everything has a point. The beauty of `The Point' is the double-meaning of `having a point', and the lessons taught herein are as timeless as they are important. With Nilsson's stirring, evocative songs lighting the path, Oblio makes his journey and shares his wisdom with his community. As an animated film ostensibly designed for children, `The Point' is cute, fun, and educational. As an animated film that can - and should - be not just viewed but flat-out devoured by adults, `The Point' serves to remind us all of an unfettered morality that is more important than any dogma or other construct - wrapped in the candy-coated shell of a captivating, and somewhat psychedelic (in the fashion of the times), piece of animation that must be seen to be believed. The DVD serves up some amazing bonus features, including one centered on Nilsson and three focusing on the film, as an extra incentive - as if anyone should need such a thing! - to check out `The Point'. Final thoughts? Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow!",1368144000,2,2790,4.627016129032258

5242118,4,B0091JJ278,"This is a review of the Definitive Collector's Edition.

""The Point"" is one of my favorite films. Its moral may seem a little ham-fisted, but that's the nature of fables, and the screenplay is so intelligently written that the simplicity of the moral doesn't matter. It's enjoyable by kids and adults alike.

The animation is limited due to the lower cost of TV production, with a clear and understandable connection to other Murakami-Wolf productions. But here the designs are a little more free-wheeling, with with simple cross-hatch shading and what looks like watercolor wash for most backgrounds. The design is a little rougher around the edges than M-W's usual output, but that's part of its charm, and there's good continuity between the characters and backgrounds in style and color. The overall look reminds me of some of the best animated shorts produced through the National Film Board of Canada during the 80s by the likes of Richard Condie and Clive Barker.

As it appears on this DVD, the film looks great. It's not quite at restored level (there's still the occasional scratch or bit of dirt on some frames) but the edges are clean, the colors are rich, and there are no dropped frames. The mono soundtrack is clean and clear. In short, the film is a delight for the eyes and ears.

The voice work is mostly splended, thanks largely to the late, incomprable Paul Frees (he played several characters), but also to Lennie Weinrib, Bill Martin, Buddy Foster, Joan Gerber, and Mike Lookinland as Oblio, who turned in an excellent job for such a young boy.

My only quarrel, and the only reason I didn't give the DVD five stars, is the casting of Ringo Starr as the narrator. I've read that Ringo was chosen because he and Harry Nilsson were close friends, but while Ringo seems like a nice guy, his acting leaves a lot to be desired, and his Liverpudlian accent clashes with the American accents that populate the rest of the film. I'd prefer to hear Dustin Hoffman's original narration, or even the second one recorded by voice actor Alan Barzman, but I don't expect the official DVD to be changed. (I have not heard any of Alan Thicke's turn as the narrator, so I can't comment on that version.)

However, even with Ringo, this DVD is worth the price of admission.

BTW, while the extras on the Collector's Edition add some dimension to Nilsson's legacy, but for existing and would-be Nilsson fans, I recommend ""Who Is Harry Nilsson, and Why Is Everybody Talking About Him?"" It's definitely not for kids, but it's an excellent examination of the life and career of this considerable but largely overlooked talent.",1358812800,,2626,4.783664459161148
