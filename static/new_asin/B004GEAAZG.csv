8428645,5,B004GEAAZG,"Bart Corbin (Rob Lowe) is a dentist with a beautiful wife Jenn (Stephanie von Pfetten) and two sons living in a luxury home in Atlanta. Jenn is very close to her sister Heather (Lauren Holly) and she confides in her that she is becoming suspicious of the time Bart is spending at work with his beautiful assistant. Partly perhaps as `payback' and partly because she is lonely, Jenn starts up an acquaintance with someone on the Internet. Shortly before Christmas, Jenn is found dead having been shot in the head. Her sister and parents cannot accept that it could be suicide, however emotionally troubled Jenn might have been. Although Bart comes under suspicion, the main suspect is Jenn's Internet confidant. As part of the investigation it emerges that one of Bart's college girlfriends also `committed suicide'. Slowly the case against Bart builds up and he is found guilty. This film is based on a true story written by Ann Rule, who specializes in fact-based thrillers. The story develops well in the film and the acting is convincing.",1351209600,2,1041,4.887005649717514
