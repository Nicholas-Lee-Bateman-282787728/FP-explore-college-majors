I heard the golden or the spotlight collection is a need to have collection when starting looney gatherings. I was going to get golden collection for him but since it's a gift I wanted to get spotlight. Spotlight packaging is so pretty!! The picture is not that detailed but the spotlight collection packaging has glittery parts on it.",1382659200,4,441,4.95945945945946
8469349,5,B005EZLSI4,"We turned off our satellite TV subscription going on two years ago. The advertising was over the top and sometimes foul. The TV shows were too often lousy. Video on demand via a Roku gave us the flexibility we wanted.

We have supplemented our streaming TV with the collections of Little Rascals, Merrie Melodies, and Three Stooges and other movies that our kids have liked. We're still hundreds of dollars ahead each year and they are happy. We're too busy with activities (Scouts, soccer, school) and other stuff to really get much out of traditional TV anyhow.",1365984000,4,563,4.804123711340206
