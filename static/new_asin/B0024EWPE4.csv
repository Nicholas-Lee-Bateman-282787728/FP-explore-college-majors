3845472,4,B0024EWPE4,"This Kino release is most likely the best we will see for sometime if not ever. However, as has been mentioned, it is obvious there is some missing footage even without researching the film. That out of the way the overall print quality is good and seeing William Powell in his first role is, for me, the real treat of this film. Taking nothing away from the great Barrymore of course. Barebones release but worth a purchase.",1273968000,2,425,4.532467532467533
3845473,4,B0024EWPE4,"I agree with the observations of the previous two reviewers but I think I can clear up a few of the information gaps. I believe that the film lacks a certain amount of suspense because most of the missing footage occurs near the end, roughly from the point of Holmes' meeting with Moriarity at Baker Street. The subsequent scene in the ""gas chamber"" room and the finale at Dr. Watson's home are cut up quite a bit making the action incomprehensible. This otherwise laudable KINO release would have been aided greatly by some liner notes explaining the critically missing action.

Although I'm no Holmes expert, it is fortunate that the film's story is based on the same William Gillette play that Orson Welles used in his radio adaptation in 1938 (broadcast a month before Welles tackled the Martian invasion). Having listened to the radio broadcast a few times over the years, I was able to figure out what was happening in the film. First, Moriarity blackmails Holmes to let him go in the Baker Street flat because he has kidnapped little Billy, the bellboy. Holmes realizes he has to agree but wants to see Billy safely returned first. The surviving footage shows a bedraggled boy standing Holmes doorway but there's no explanation of who he is or why he's there.

Second, Holmes escapes the trap of the gas chamber room by misdirection - he makes the villains (including a wonderfully surly Louis Wolheim, a Barrymore buddy)think he escaped through one door and they all follow in pursuit. Holmes then suavely walks out another door to freedom. One at least can follow the action at the finale in Watson's flat although the action is choppy. Curiously, left out of the finale is the fate of the Faulkner letters that motivated the whole story in the first place. At least we finally know how William Powell later became such a fine detective as Philo Vance and Nick Charles - he started out working for Sherlock Holmes!

I'm a longtime Barrymore fan so I know I'm biased but I enjoyed every moment of SHERLOCK HOLMES, especially since it gave JB the opportunity to appear with later well-known film actors such as William Powell and Roland Young, with whom he never made sound films. This film did not give Barrymore opportunities to show his comedy abilities or give him a ""mad scene"" that made most his other silents so memorable. Also, Barrymore had to go up against ""the"" one and only portrayal of Holmes by William Gillette, who had played the role on stage since the 1890s (and continued through the 1930s!). So he may have believed that he couldn't stray too far from the public's well-entrenched view of Holmes. To be fair, the original reviews of the complete film back in 1922 were rather luke-warm so even with missing footage we should be grateful to KINO for restoring this long missing film (not counting dreadful bootlegs) back to the Barrymore filmography. Viva KINO!",1265760000,7,2887,4.77
3845474,4,B0024EWPE4,"This is one of several early, silent film versions of the ever-popular detective, and one that lives up to the original and traditional trademarks and characteristics of Sherlock Holmes.  In just under 90 minutes, this fast-moving drama takes us from the beginning of Sherlock's career as a freelance sleuth helping out Scotland Yard, meeting his arch enemy, Professor Moriarty, and finishing with the capture of the infamous evildoer after forty crime cases Holmes had worked on over the years.  But rather than the typical murders and crimes we are used to today, the story of this 1922 version revolves only around one particular case of a theft and consequent set-up of a European Prince, as well as letters to his betrothed which are later the object of a blackmail attempt.  Even so, Holmes puts into action his famous (and often humorous) astute observations and deductive reasoning with his loyal companion, Doctor Watson, and even disguises himself as Moriarty in order to trap the villain once and for all.

What might seem like a somewhat dull and plodding story to modern audiences is given extra appeal and zest by some of the stars, in particular of course, its famous star, John Barrymore.  Although this role as Sherlock Holmes doesn't present many opportunities for Barrymore to shine and show off his usual charisma and talents, he does step into the part of Holmes quite well, even if it takes a little getting used to at first.  A good villain is also important in stories like this one, and the sinister Moriarty is perfectly portrayed by the brilliant character actor, Gustav von Seyffertitz, who played an impressive array of varied characters, good and evil, throughout the silent era.  Also thrown into the mix to attract a wider audience is Carol Dempster, famous for being D.W. Griffith's leading lady in a number of 1920s films, who plays a small but significant role as Sherlock's love interest, adding a twist not expected in the standard Sherlock Holmes mystery.  Other viewers might find it of interest to see William Powell, perhaps best remembered for the Thin Man series of movies in the 1930s and 1940s, in his screen debut in ""Sherlock Holmes"" as Forman Wells, also playing a small yet important role in assisting Holmes.

The picture quality is overall quite good, though perhaps not as outstanding as many other silent films from the early 1920s issued on Kino, and the music is a very good organ score composed and played by Ben Model, who has performed many fine organ accompaniments to silent films.  There are no bonus or special features on this DVD, and it is part of a four-DVD set by Kino of John Barrymore silent films, and as part of such a collection ""Sherlock Holmes"" is an important addition to highlight Barrymore's earlier and unusual roles.  On its own, it would be of special interest for Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts in particular, and some knowledge of the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would no doubt help in appreciating this particular silent version.",1248480000,18,3024,4.909803921568628
3845475,3,B0024EWPE4,"I have looked forward to having John Barrymore's SHERLOCK HOLMES on DVD for quite some time. I had seen the movie before but only in a wretched public domain VHS which was so dark that most of the film was hard to make out. The first half is made up of original material that sets the stage for the second half which is the William Gillette play. Holmes and Watson begin as college students at Cambridge which leads to his first encounter with Moriarty. The scene is clever and memorable. It's a shame the rest of the movie can't match it. Although atmospherically lit, the camerawork is rather static and the direction is often ponderous. To be fair, this restoration by the George Eastman House is 24 minutes shorter than the original and this could be a case of where the missing footage makes it seem longer. There are obvious gaps and the film just doesn't flow right.

The biggest problem with this release as far as I'm concerned is the use of Ben Model's virtual organ score. Model is a fine musician who has enhanced many a silent film but this is a movie that badly needs an orchestral score to cover its deficiencies. This score, while well played and well recorded, failed to keep my interest. Still the movie is definitely worth having for the performances alone. In addition to Barrymore you get to see early turns by William Powell (his first), Roland Young (as Dr. Watson), Carole Dempster (away from D.W. Griffith), Hedda Hopper before she became a columnist, and Gustav von Seyffertitz as the ideal Moriarty. The actual London locations also enhance the proceedings. The Blu-Ray edition is slightly better and is the way to go for the vest results regarding this title.",1246320000,19,1687,4.68013468013468
3845481,5,B0024EWPE4,"An outstanding example of early cinema that should appeal to any aficionado of the silent era, this 1922 film also proves its merit as a serious Holmesian adaptation. While there is no question liberties have been taken with characterization, a testament to the fact it was heavily based on William Gilette's infamous stage play, remarkably enough, those changes flow well with both the character and plot, so that this version of the Great Detective's exploits is actually not so Canonically dubious as this purist had originally imagined it might be.

Featuring one of the most mesmerizing actors to fill the exalted role of Sherlock Holmes, John Barrymore's portrayal cannot be overlooked. True, the acting was above par, the plot strikingly complex, but he slips into the character so thoroughly, sans all those extraneous trappings not found in the stories, which would later become synonymous with Holmes due to the innumerable other actors who left their mark, even the love aspect becomes tolerable - if not believable. It is obvious Barrymore is deriving a monumental portion of his inspiration from Canon, because while there /is/ a love interest for him in the form of Alice Faulkner, his Holmes remains a thinker, his deductions and solutions deeply motivated in intellectualism. And make no mistake, while it does involve a romance, it is more of a background sub-plot, and this film is decidedly not a love-story.

On that account, though, being such an early example, Barrymore has mainly the books to gain insight from, and that is apparent in the way in which he plays a Sherlock Holmes under the spell of Cupid's arrow. His Holmes is obviously head over heels, but still manages to come off as tentatively innocent, quietly reserved about what must be an overwhelming emotion for one so accustomed to repressing them. He is blessedly free of theatricality, truly the ""quiet thinker of Baker Street"".

As a general rule, I normally find romance to be off-putting character assassination, but developing it as he did with the confines of how Holmes might react without losing his formidable acumen, Barrymore not only convinced me it could have happened in such a way, but also made it quite endearing. From a personal standpoint, he epitomized Sherlock Holmes for me that well. As did the film itself, its plot strikingly complex, with the entirety of it reminiscent of several Canon stories. I even lost count of how many deductions and snippets of dialogue it paid homage to. And cleverly, too, with a Moriarty that was given a prominent presence and was possibly one of the most ominously creepy Napoleon of Crimes to grace the silver screen until Eric Porter later epitomized the role.

Roland Young, unlike others who would follow shortly thereafter, portrays a capable, multifaceted Watson who is a schoolmate of Holmes' at Cambridge, as is Prince Alexis, who has been wrongly accused of theft and petitions the doctor for help. Watson, of course, petitions Holmes to look into the matter, where he sees Moriarty's hand, but is at the present unable to thwart the Professor. After the initial case is resolved - or rather, covered up by Moriarty - Holmes loses sympathy for the Prince regarding his ill treatment of his fiance, who also happens to be the sister of Alice Faulkner. There both his interest in her and that case will lie to rest until many years later, when he learns Moriarty is out to harm Miss Faulkner, who intends to use letters of her sister to blackmail the Prince (a la SCAN), letters he wants for his own nefarious purposes...

In summation; intricate plotting, a (apologies, but I must admit it) satisfying romance, competent Dr Watson, Barrymore's eccentric, cerebral Holmes who epitomizes the character, intelligent ""dialogue"" that did not require the complete cessation of neuronal activity, and one pretty impressive Moriarty, made for an extremely enjoyable silent film which is, from a  personal standpoint, deserving of being ranked alongside other Holmesian classics. My only complaint is that Watson, while faithful to the man described in the original stories, his relationship with Holmes ringing true, was shamefully underused here. If that were not the case, I would be hard pressed to say this were not the greatest underrated film adaption. As it stands, its definitely one of the better ones, and really should be viewed by those who love the silents and serious Holmesians alike.",1422576000,,4443,5.038095238095238
3845482,4,B0024EWPE4,"Last month I saw this silent restoration as part of a Holmes film festival. Both in private and public venues it holds up magnificently. Roland Young is a revelation to watch as Dr. Watson - it was hard not to compare his mute presence here to what he added to many good talkies in the Thirties including ""Ruggles of Red Gap"" and ""Topper."" The chief attraction however is ""The Great Profile."" It is impossible to look away whenever Barrymore is on screen as ""The Great Detective."" His granddaughter Drew has a certain amount of that same quality, a fact enormously apparent in ""Grey Gardens."" Any Holmes or Barrymore fan would be misguided to pass up this classic.",1414627200,2,664,4.683760683760684

3845484,2,B0024EWPE4,This movie is extremely dark and it is a silent era film.  I love Sherlock Holmes but this should be posted as a 'non-talkie' film.,1385769600,,131,4.24
3845485,4,B0024EWPE4,"Silent films are not the best medium for Sherlock Holmes cases, because his deductive inferences require reasoning beyond which you can see.  While Sherlock Holmes and the audience may see the same thing, it misses the point of the stories if his inferences are not clearly explained to us.  Holmes was so popular, though, that the opportunity to put him on the silver screen was irresistible.  A young John Barrymore grabbed the title role in this 1922 movie directed by Albert Parker.

The action is based on the stage version of Sherlock Holmes by William Gillette.  You can still find elements of the story that are found in the original cases by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but the case as a whole is hard to follow, even with dialogue boards added throughout the movie. This is, I believe, a limitation of the medium of communication.

Early in the film there is a scene where Holmes is pondering the science of deduction.  The list of his limitations is taken from the famous list of Doctor Watson in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Study-in-Scarlet/dp/1456512609/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Study in Scarlet</a>.  The ability to discover a man's height by the length of his stride is also discussed in `A Study In Scarlet.'  During his studies in curiosity, Holmes falls from a window as the beautiful Alice Faulker, played by Carol Dempster, was riding by in a carriage.  Faulkner provides the love-interest for Holmes in this silent film.

Ironically, Sherlock Holmes never had a love interest in the cases.  A later scene, where he keeps a photo of Rose Faulkner to remind him of her sister Alice, has a similar moment in `A Scandal in Bohemia.'  Bohemia was the first of the Sherlock Holmes short stories, and opened with the fabulous line, To Sherlock Holmes, she was always the woman.  But Irene Adler didn't reappear in the canon; she was more of a clever antagonist for Holmes than a love interest, and she only became romantically involved with Holmes in Hollywood adaptions of his cases.

When Holmes tells Watson that married life agrees with him, that line and the anecdote about the servant girl also comes from `A Scandal in Bohemia.'  The deduction about Watson moving the table because of his shaving habits is from `The Boscombe Valley Mystery.'  Both short stories were collected in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/0486474917/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</a>, the first of Arthur Conan Doyles collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories.

The old man disguise in the movie was a famous scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sign-of-Four/dp/1420925644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sign of Four</a>.  Holmes, of course, was master of disguise.  The majority of the film focuses on the villain Professor Moriarty, who is fully described in the short story `The Final Problem,' an influential short story that all Sherlock Holmes fans ought to read.  The German actor who played the Professor does not look like the man described in The Final Problem, but he was acceptable as a villain.  The United States spent millions of dollars in propaganda during World War I to paint the Huns as villains; as a result, actors with German names received steady work typecast as villains during the Roaring Twenties.  From his opening scene, the viewer instantly recognized Professor Moriarty as a villain.

The Final Problem was a short story from the collection entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Memoirs-of-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/0486477835/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</a>.  Two other cases from the Memoirs, the Gloria Scott and Musgrave Ritual, describe the young detective Sherlock Holmes as a student, who worked on cases introduced to him by fellow students.  Those details provide the background for the beginning of this film.

An assistant named Billy the page appeared in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Valley-of-Fear/dp/1595691413/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Valley of Fear</a>, one of the four Sherlock Holmes novellas.  Billy also appeared in the Mazarin Stone, a case which was released the year before this movie was made.

The movie had enough references to the Sherlock Holmes cases of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to interest this viewer.  The story itself, as it appeared in the silent movie format, appeared disjointed and not easy to follow.  The quality of the film was good; Kino did a nice job of restoration on the movie.",1372204800,,4689,5.742402315484805
3845486,3,B0024EWPE4,"This was the first time I sat through a lengthy silent film drama.  This may be a salvaged silent film, but it seemed that parts were missing which is ironic because it is very lengthy!  Printed dialogue seemed to skip silent actors implied script which made the storyline seem disjointed.  Interesting and enjoyable if one focuses on the actors and their silent craft.  But the seemingly lack of storyline continuity and overall film length make this very tedious to sit through to the end.  However, being as I am certainly not very knowledgeable concerning silent film stories, perhaps this is typical.",1356566400,,605,4.9504950495049505
3845487,5,B0024EWPE4,"i love old movies, and am very partial to silents, but the acting can be rather....excessive, shall we say. john barrymore can be a bit of an eye-roller, and his dr jekyll and mr hyde is fun but over the top, so i expected his sherlock to be similarly hammy. boy, was i wrong!  he is remarkable---so controlled and thoughtful, it's just riveting. he exudes such quiet charisma, like sherlock holmes should, unflappable and self assured.  and it's so much fun to see the likes of roland young as watson, a baby faced william powell, and hedda hopper, before she became a fearsome columnist, in support of barrymore. the story seems to be a composite of several holmes adventures and its very hollywood ending is a little jarring, but i bought this out of curiosity and ended up loving it.",1355270400,3,787,4.614285714285714
3845488,4,B0024EWPE4,"Comparing the new Blu-ray to the old DVD shows that there are two main, but slight, improvements.
First: The black levels have been raised a little, just enough to bring out details that are hard to see in the old DVD but not enough to make it look washed out. (The same player was used for both discs so it is not a player issue.)
Second: The framing shows just a sliver more picture on all sides. I first noticed this when you can see the film frame line move into the picture and move back out. This is no doubt the result of image stabilization which was masked off in the DVD presentation.

A good frame to compare the presentations on is at 04:14 into the movie. An interior office shot with two men at a desk. At the top of the picture the two books on the mantle piece are completely in view on the Blu-ray, but the DVD cuts off the top of the second book. Likewise there is a knob at the bottom of the picture that gets cut off slightly in the DVD.  The right side of the picture is in dark shadows, but on the black-adjusted Blu-ray you can see details of a chair and other objects that are hard to see in the darker DVD.

And yes, Blu-ray has more resolution than DVD so on a big screen the image will look sharper. On a 32"" TV you will not notice the difference.

BONUS FEATURES:
Yes, Kino has technically added some bonus material, 3 theatrical re-issue trailers.
1) Moroder's Metropolis
2) The Complete Metropolis
3) Battleship Potemkin
These are the trailers that recently ran at theaters to promote that theater's showings of Kino's new restored versions.

There is a nice reproduction of a trade magazine ad for the Sherlock Holmes movie on the reverse side of the cover insert that was not on the DVD.  And the new menu shows stills from the movie, some may just be frame grabs while others are probably from trade ads.

Other minor changes are a new revised Kino Classics/Kino Lorber logo replacing the old Kino International logo, and a fancier FBI warning logo.

Quite frankly I was surprised to see John Barrymore's Sherlock Holmes come out on Blu-ray, the original film material was not in that great of shape. My first hope was that some of the missing footage was found, not so. Is there reason to re-invest in a Blu-ray copy if you already have the DVD, maybe.  The improved details in the shadows do make the movie more enjoyable, but if you are happy with the picture quality of your DVD there is no big reason to upgrade.

For the side-by-side comparison I ran only the first 6 minutes of each presentation on the same Sony Blu-ray player and monitor. I do have an advance review copy.  If there is a glaring difference later on in the movie i will update my review.",1322524800,16,2695,4.380761523046092
3845489,2,B0024EWPE4,"Movies have been taking liberties with Conan Doyle's creation long before Guy Ritchie, with the Great Profile's 1922 silent take on the Great Detective, Sherlock Holmes (aka Moriarty), a modern-day version ill-advisedly rewriting the book in a manner that offended the purists while not coming up with anything new to appeal to the more casual moviegoer, then or now. Partially shot on location in London and opening with some striking overhead shots of the city, it's not as terrible as its reputation nor as good as it should be considering all the talent and money involved (Reginald Denny, Louis Wolheim and future gossip queen Hedda Hopper are in it as well). Revolving around a blackmail attempt and some love letters to a European Prince from the woman who killed herself when they were prevented from marrying, it's at times a talky script, always a problem in a silent film, with more of a taste for melodrama than sleuthing.

A very loose adaptation of William Gillette's play, it begins with Holmes and Watson as fellow university students, charting his first encounter with Moriarty (on learning the fate of various detectives who have tried to bring him to book, Holmes responds ""Oh! - Well, of course, if you're as difficult to know as all that, I'd better be getting back to my microbes"") that sets him on a life of fighting crime. But along the way we get Holmes rustically ruminating on human nature and, of all things, falling in love at first sight with Carol Dempster's innocent girl and spending much of the first half of the film in a daze. Or it could be plain disinterest as Barrymore hardly seems terribly engaged with his role, going through the motions of concentrating and staring into the far distance while making little impression. Not that he has much to work with, Holmes going by instinct rather than deductive reasoning - `It's easier for me to know Wells is guilty than to explain how I know it' he admits early in the game - while only briefly demonstrating his deductive reasoning in a scene with a clumsily shaved Roland Young's underemployed Watson. As for the domestic revelation in the last scene, it's enough to give the hardcore Holmes fans a fit, though it is rather obvious that Barrymore's real-life hatred for co-star Dempster led to him insisting on a stand in for her in their final clinch.

Holmes isn't the only one to get a bit of a makeover. Gustav Von Seyffertitz's scruffy Moriarty, introduced in the middle of a spider's web and operating from a torture dungeon in Limehouse, seems inspired more by Barrymore's Mr Hyde than Doyle while, aside from a paperboy in the unsatisfactorily perfunctory ending, the closest it gets to a Baker Street Irregular is William Powell in his first film as a thief who defects to Holmes' side and whose fate is left vague for much of the last part of the film by the still missing footage. Whereby hangs a tale.

The film was lost for decades until the negative of several cans of out of order sequences were found in George Eastman House in 1970, with Kevin Brownlow and William K. Everson screening them for director Albert Parker and basing the lengthy restoration (funded by Hugh Hefner and the National Parks Foundation among others over more than three decades) on his notes. Unfortunately things get rather confusing towards the end thanks to some still missing footage: where public screenings of the restoration filled in the gaps with stills and explanatory captions, Kino Video's extras-free DVD from 2008 makes no such concessions, with events around Holmes' second encounter with Moriarty particularly abrupt (a wounded man and a rejected proposition referred to in one title card literally come out of nowhere while another segment ends abruptly). One for the Barrymore and Holmes completists only, though it is amusing to note that even in 1922 films were making in-jokes about evil masterminds wasting time on elaborate death traps rather than simply killing their nemesis the easy way.",1292716800,6,3992,4.884955752212389

8350419,4,B0024EWPE4,"I've wanted to see Barrymore's seminal Holmes for quite some time.  My review is based on the streaming version through Amazon.  The film restoration is better than I expected, allowing for variations in shadows and lighting.  The story tends to run long but it's hard to tell if it is the story itself or the effect of the missing material.

Barrymore is a force on the silent screen.  Watching his Holmes, I can see the impetus for Rathbone and Brett.  Holmes in the hands of Barrymore is a smart man in search of wisdom.  Solving crime is easy.  The ephemeral qualities of emotion, especially female interactions, stay out of reach. I'm glad the movie was silent because the physical and emotional articulation of Holmes clearly stands out.

A note about Moriarty.  Played to perfection by Gustav von Seyffertitz, here is Moriarty as he should be.  An evil man with no pretensions of good. No need to clean him up and present him in a tux;  Moriarty is comfortable - happy? - with his moral place in the world.

The movie is also notable for screen debuts by Roland Young (as Dr. Watson) and William Powell (as the character Forman Wells). Hedda Hopper also puts in a fine performance.

One disappointment is the organ score by Ben Model.  The music is played on a virtual Midi instrument, the Miditizer Virtual Theatre Organ and has an odd, two-dimensional quality that is never really a part of the movie.  The notes follow along the film's progress like some barely interested bystander.  I would prefer an orchestral score or at least a real theater organ with a score tuned to the movies emotional context.  Barrymore's performance could be made all the richer by the complexities of a string score.

Overall, well worth watching for fans of Holmes and silent films.",1437177600,2,1774,4.738562091503268
