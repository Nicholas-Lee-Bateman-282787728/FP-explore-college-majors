4000642,4,B002VP3C9S,"I ordered my copy directly via the band's website and even with the expected holiday international postal delays I received it in less than 2 weeks. If not for the somewhat annoying 'film' video effects during the performance (must be a European thing), it is an excellent DVD.  The sound is great.  The bonus performances on disc 2 are fortunately sans effects.  If not for the effects used on disc 1 I would have given 5 stars.",1262908800,5,429,4.545454545454546
8382313,5,B002VP3C9S,Great band from Poland. Have all of their releases and dvds.,1520467200,,60,4.545454545454546
8382314,5,B002VP3C9S,"I know most artists want to be in a class by their own, not to be compared to anyone else. But few can really say they haven't been influenced by the classics (Yes, Floyd, Genesis, etc.) and fewer can say their sound is modern & contemporary. This is the case with Riverside. We are not in the presence of clones of the said classic bands. If one comparison can be made it would be with Porcupine Tree. Both bands share the intelligence, dynamics, subtle heavyness and emotions associated with great melodies.

These guys all played heavy metal but were able to ""turn down"" this heavy side, keeping just enough edge & tension. One other thing that reminds me of Porcupine Tree is the use of synth. We don't get the overlayered keyboards necessary in some other bands to fill the gaps. The synth here is used with intelligence and is only one part of the whole ensemble.

Riverside is very good and this DVD shows them at their best but also shows (in the extras) that they're far from the top yet. Hopefully, they will come in America to show what Polish musicians are capable of and give the industry a good kick in the a***!

It's up to you now to spread the word or just enjoy a great evening of music!",1347494400,,1205,4.394618834080718
8382315,5,B002VP3C9S,"In fact I'd have to say that, without a doubt, this is up there with Porcupine Tree's excellent Anesthetize and Roger Waters' In the Flesh as among the best live DVDs I own!! And this one isn't even in surround sound!

It is even better than the 7 track bonus DVD that came with the limited edition Anno Domini High Definition CD a few years ago (though all 7 of those songs are on this one too). And, yes, it is a different concert, filmed in a TV studio in front of a small audience (guessing hometown/fanclub type thing).

The first disc is the main concert. The track list is: The Same River, Out of Myself, Volte-Face*, Rainbow Box, 02 Panic Room*, Reality Dream III, I Turned You Down, Dance with the Shadow, Parasomnia*, Second Life Syndrome*, and The Curtain Falls*. And, in case you care, the * are my favorites.

The second disc contains the 2 encores; Before and Ultimate Trip (and this time the entire song, not just the abbreviated first half that's on the ADHD bonus disc) and 7 ""bootleg"" tracks, recorded in during 2006-2008. They are: Beyond the Eyelids, Loose Heart, Back to the River, Conceiving You, I Believe, Lucid Dream IV, and Reality Dream II. Of course, being bootlegs, they are not up to the quality of the main concert. (And when the heck am I gonna get a live video of Cybernetic Pillow?!?!? Guys - PLEASE put it on a future live DVD!)

There's also a documentary but, as another reviewer has already mentioned, it's not all that good, I haven't even watched the entire thing yet and probably never will.

And though it's not in 5.1, only stereo, this is one instance where it doesn't matter in the LEAST because the production is SUPERB, one of the best sounding DVDs or CDs I've heard in a while! On my Infinity Kappas you can even tell when the drummer hits the hi-hat vs. open/closes it! It's that crisp!! While some may gripe about the lack of 5.1 I can say without hesitation that this DVD sounds better than at least half of the concert DVDs I have that are in 5.1! I've also already ripped the audio to CD, am listening to it now, and it sounds great on headphones too! But, it could certainly use a DTS HD encoded BluRay release, which would probably already exist if Riverside was more popular in the States!

In fact the only gripe I have is a small one: I could do without the ""arty-farty"" visuals, just show me the video. In my opinion the ""scratches"", making it look like it's raining, use of lead-in frames, and other visuals actually distracts from the enjoyment of the concert. This is the one area where the ADHD bonus disc has this one beat. But like I said, that's just a small irritation and certainly isn't going to downgrade my appreciation for this masterpiece. But any producers and/or visual artists who happen to see this review should take note because most people I know don't like stuff like this, they'd rather just see the show.

Oh - and the #@&%*! title menu?!?!?! What kind of imbecilic MORON puts distorted white noise on the first thing that pops up after you put the disc in?!?!?! Even ""arty-farty"" types should know better and I'm shocked the band allowed this to go forward!! I'll tell you the ribbon tweeters in my Infinitys REALLY love it (sic) and if the volume is too loud when that menu comes on it'll blow the tweeter fuses!!!! Thanks a lot guys!!! But this is another small complaint solved by simply making sure I turn the volume down before switching discs and GETTING PAST THE MENU ASAP!!

Bottom line - Riverside is one of THE best ""powerprog"" bands in the world right now and have overtaken Porcupine Tree as my favorite current band. So if you like good rock and roll, especially if you like bands like Dream Theater, Tool, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Threshold, etc, etc, you owe it to yourself to check them out immediately, there is NO WAY you'll be disappointed. I also know quite a few ""metalheads"" who like them.

And if live DVDs aren't your thing then begin with 2007's Rapid Eye Movement, my personal favorite. But that's only by the slimmest of hairs over Anno Domini High Definition (2009), also an awesome album. And there's also 2005's Second Life Syndrome, which is #42 on Prog Archive's list of the 100 all-time best prog albums and their #1 rated album of 2005. It is often cited as their best by many fans. Heck...if you like this genre at all you simply need to get all three!

Now...if they'd just tour the U.S. I'd be a happy man!! And I don't mean just a festival here and there (but never near me)...I mean a complete tour! Hopefully, if their popularity continues to increase, they will come here for a complete national tour.",1333324800,3,4625,4.5149342891278375
8382316,3,B002VP3C9S,"Ok, usually I'm not a big fan of the so-called ""Progressive Metal"", even though sometimes I can appreciate a few live gigs, like the present one, anyway witnessing the activity of this Polish Band from Warsewz in a special way!!
When the work ""Anno Domini High Definition"" from Studio was issued, simultaneously Riverside recorded this live in the course of 2008, then post produced at Toya Studios in the following year...two band members came from the world of prog metal, but actually the other members were so involved with a different genre, similar to an aggressive progressive rock, tinged with dark tones, which brought about a diverse mood around their exhibitions on stage!

They remind me of a kind of Modern and dark psychedelic prog, resembling the sound of the recent Porcupine Tree for example, regardless of the ipnotic opener entitled ""The same river"", whose atmoshere is enriched by means of an interesing guitar, almost ""oneiric"" in its melodic lines. Unfortunately some other songs like ""Rainbow box"" or ""Out of myself"" are not convincing, above all for their lacking creativity, as well as the vocal interpretation, which seems to emulate J. La Brie from Dream Theater in a forced manner...even though the following suite is not bad, especially the interplay guitar/organ within a ""non-linear"" pattern of ""Volte-Face"", here reminding me of Dream Theater once again. Instead ""Reality dream #3"" is characterized by some soft breaks-through alternating a few immediate technical solos, without a common thread.

The visualization and the scenographic aspects of the band, a bit static on stage, represent the second defect of this band, despite of the 16 minutes suite ""Second Life Syndrome"" ,which is their classic powerful number...ok, but is it enough to regard their music an innovative example of art, especially nowadays?

Anyway a good and essential live work only within a collection of dark prog metal, certainly influenced by a kind of soft progressive rock!! So make your own choice as usual!!",1289088000,,2022,5.17737003058104
8382317,5,B002VP3C9S,"I've been a long time Riverside fan, and I've purchaced everything they've released to date. I must say this live performace was just what I've been waiting for, since it's nearly impossible to see this band live in person. It's a real shame they've yet to gain the respect they so much deserve. I can only hope that this live DVD will show the rest of the prog-metal world what incredible musicians Riverside truly are. They are a unique band, with a heavy, soothing, flowing sound that you just can't quite classify. It's intoxicating...

I've seen some various live footage of Riverside in the past, but nothing else comes even close to this performance in terms of overall execution. This DVD was shot professionally, and you can tell that Riverside were completely focused on cranking out a flawless show. Bottom Line : If you have an open mind to various types of metal, {that's mostly on the prog side}, Riverside is an excellent addition to anyone's collection. I highly suggest checking out all of Riverside's studio releases. They're truly one of a kind, and when it comes to pushing the boundaries of metal, these guys thrive on it...

8382318,5,B002VP3C9S,"I have most of the discography of Riverside and I never doubt about their skills, but in this DVD is clear that their technique is amazing, and I dear to say that Dream Theater has a fair rival.

I would only include 5.1 sound.",1285632000,2,227,4.159090909090909
8382319,4,B002VP3C9S,"Definitely a great progressive band - the DVD contains some of my favorite songs, and they are as impressive to watch as they are to listen to. Unfortunately, some idiot decided that it would be a good idea to add irritating white noise to the menu, which makes your stereo sound like it is about to explode. It actually makes you fearful to insert the DVD into your player.",1285459200,,374,4.434782608695652
8382320,5,B002VP3C9S,"It's truly a pity that Riverside is not better known here in the US. Here you have one of the finest progressive rock groups on the world stage today, and the band gets little if any stateside airplay and increases its US fan base largely by word-of-mouth. That's a hard slog. Mariusz Duda and band deserve better.
If you have yet to hear Riverside, you are going to be astounded by its atmospheric sound and, for those who cut their musical teeth in the '70s, by the almost familiar sound of Duda's vocals. If you are already a fan, you know just how good these Polish progmasters are. With Reality Dream, you get a meaty two DVD set packed with music and extras. The first DVD features twelve live songs that run for approximately an hour and forty-five minutes. On the second disc you get two encores from the first show, seven songs played in various venues, a short film and a photo gallery. To sum it up, you get value for money. I like all of the live cuts, the play is flawless and the presentation exhilarating. Unlike some, I enjoy the added visual effects.
Reality Dream is a real piece of work that will be in frequent rotation until the next great thing comes along. Even after that, it is a recording that won't be allowed to gather dust. Reality Dream comes recommended as one of the best prog DVDs I've enjoyed in sometime. Though the price may seem a little steep, you'll find after just the first viewing that its worth every penny paid.",1277856000,6,1455,4.453183520599251
8382321,5,B002VP3C9S,"I swear I am going to wear out Riverside's new 2-disc live DVD ""Reality Dream"".

And, yes, it is a different concert, filmed in a TV studio in front of a small audience (guessing hometown/fanclub type thing).

In fact I'd have to say that, in just 2 weeks, it has shot up there with Porcupine Tree's Arriving Somewhere and Roger Waters' In the Flesh as among the best live DVDs I own!!

Now...if they'd just tour the U.S. I'd be a happy man!! (They are playing one show here, The NEARfest in Pennsylvania in June, but I hear it's already sold out. To those of you going....I am ENVIOUS!!)",1269907200,7,4597,4.467222884386174
8382322,4,B002VP3C9S,"Riverside is a tasteful band. They are all accomplished musicians; the songwriting is full of melody, the vocals are killer, and they way they arrange music is stellar.  For example, the guitar work has very few chords, mostly Piotr just chirps the right note at the right time, while the keyboards fill in the rhythm and the bass and drums hold the groove.  I never really noticed how great a keyboardist Michal was, but on this DVD it's obvious. He fills up so much space with classy playing.

The first DVD is 1 hour 27 minutes, from a show filmed in Poland in May of 2008. It showcases a good selection of tracks from the first three albums. The audio mix is good but is presented in stereo only. The video editing is ok, but there are lots of video effects added that I don't care for.

The second DVD has two encores from the first DVD. Also, seven additional songs (41 minutes) filmed at different locations are included. These songs are different, that is, no song is repeated. The audio (stereo only) is good, not the quality of the first DVD, however, there are no video effects. The 15 minute ""Behind the Curtain"" bonus feature is disappointing. I was hoping for some interviews with the band, but all this feature shows is the crew and band setting up for the gig, some sound checks, and signing autographs.  Finally, a photo gallery is included.

Overall, if you're a fan, this is a must. I can only hope if there is another DVD release, we get band interviews with English subtitles and a 5.1 mix of the show.",1267747200,9,1523,4.48014440433213
