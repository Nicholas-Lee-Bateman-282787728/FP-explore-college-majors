3832010,4,B0021GYDAE,"This Finnish film tells the story of Nikolas, who, as a young boy, is orphaned. The villagers, not knowing what else to do, decide that a different family will provide Nikolas his home for a year, and each Christmas, Nikolas will move to the next family. During this process, Nikolas begins carving wooden animals and other toys to repay his friends' kindness, and he leaves these gifts outside the recipients' doors on Christmas.

At one point, a local carpenter, Iisakki (the wonderful Finnish actor Kari V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen), discovers Nikolas's ability with carving and convinces the village that he should take Nikolas in. Gruff and bitter at first, Iisakki insists that Nikolas refer to him as ""Master"" and treats the boy as a servant. Eventually, though, Iisakki warms to the boy, and they develop a caring relationship as Nikolas continues his gift-giving.

The film is wonderful to look at, shot as it was in Finnish Lapland, and there is little to prevent fairly young children from enjoying the film. The film is rated PG because of ""mild thematic elements and brief smoking,"" according to the MPAA. The thematic elements, I presume, are primarily the elements that make Nikolas an orphan (the deaths of his parents and young brother). The smoking refers to pipes that several of the characters have.

DVD extras include a ""making of"" featurette (in Finnish with English subtitles) and the film's trailer (in English). The film is in English with no option for the original Finnish language, and there are no subtitles available for the feature.",1257033600,79,1560,5.062256809338521

The explanation of  Santa Claus figure is just wonderful, and so fitting with its time and culture. the voice actors are so good that I quickly became oblivious to the fact that it's dubbed, which I usually strongly dislike and can't get past. And, filmed in Lapland, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. It will be a yearly beloved tradition for me!",1485129600,,398,4.768115942028985

3832032,5,B0021GYDAE,"Great story for the entire family.
This is a different explanation for the origin of Santa Claus, and its as good as any story I have seen. Its start's off with tragedy, a little boy loses his family, and no one family is able to care for the child. The village priest comes up with a unique solution, have the boy stay with family for one year.  The unfolding of Nicholas' life is a lesson to everyone, take what is handed to you, show gratitude for those who help you, and try to be understanding negative people around you.  As an adult, I also enjoyed this film.",1483056000,,566,4.280373831775701

3832034,5,B0021GYDAE,"This independent foreign film is quite deceiving upon first watch given its' simplistic beginnings and unknowing cast but let me assure you- you won't think of Christmas ever the same after you've absorbed the rich scenery and humble real ness of each character brilliantly brought to life.

3832036,5,B0021GYDAE,"My husband's family is from Finland and I wanted to find a Christmas movie that had a Finnish flavor for him. I ordered Christmas Story and we watched it a few days after it arrived. We didn't have any big expectations. But, now I am so happy I ordered it. This one is going into our Classic Christmas Movie pile. We will watch this year after year. It is beautifully filmed, the actors are excellent and the story line is wonderful. This movie isn't filled with cliches or commercialism. It has some bittersweet moments and isn't all about happy little elves singing silly songs. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.) This has more of an old-world feel. The clothing looks authentic, the scenery is sublime and you truly get caught up in the story. From boyhood to grown man you are invited to follow the story of Nikolas. You feel for him through his challenges and see how he grows into the man we know as Santa Claus. Highly recommended. Good for the whole family.",1482364800,2,975,4.545454545454546

3832042,3,B0021GYDAE,"Normally I wouldn't even write a review if a product didn't work out as well as I had hoped, but I want let people who are looking for the true story of Saint Nicolas to know that this film, although the acting, set and filming are great, it is not completely true. Saint Nicolas parents did die but they died of sickness. Nicolas was indeed left an orphan as the film implies but he was not left poor. He came from a wealthy family and was left a wealthy inheritance to help others and show them Christ's Love. There may be many great parts to this film, but for our little Fam of Faith we want to know The True Story of Saint Nicolas and share this Truth of God's LOVE with others. Shalom & God Bless all who worked on this Film!!!!!",1480291200,4,735,4.146853146853147

A lot of people seem to be put off by foreign films that are overdubbed and can't get past the ""words don't match the mouth"" thing..  folks, if you can just overlook that *minor* detail then you will find a very touching story, wonderfully acted and beautifully photographed.

3832124,5,B0021GYDAE,"This movie has become my Holiday favorite! It is rated PG and will be a joy for EVERYONE to watch.
It is a wonderful story about how the legend of Santa Claus may have been created; based on the fictional life experience of a young boy who grew up in a very cold and harsh climate (probably Northern Europe ~1900's) and whose life was altered greatly by a cranky guardian with his own story to tell. The movie is foreign in nature, but the dialog is English and subtitles are an option.

Delivery was very fast ~ Thank You",1389744000,,522,4.2727272727272725
3832125,5,B0021GYDAE,"After 73 years of reading and hearing stories about where Santa Cluas comes from and how he delivers all those toys all over the world, in a sleigh with 8, then 9 reindeer,  this one is a refreshing change.  There are real people in a real depiction of how and where an orphan child, Christopher Kringle, overcame the tragedy of his parents death, and spends his childhood living among a new family, each year, until he finally becomes a workshop assistant for a crabby old woodworker, who ultimately softens towards Christopher and makes a gift of his workshop to his lovable apprentice.  Christopher's generousity, coupled with his new resources, allows Chris to fulfill his liflong dream of giving gifts to children.  The scenic beauty of the stark winter environment is stunning.  Our grandchildren love this movie; and so do their parents.",1389484800,,844,4.957446808510638

3832129,5,B0021GYDAE,"Absolutely loved this DVD.  This is a version of how St. Nicholas came to be.  The scenery is stunning and he sound effects were great as well.  The only thing one might find negative is that the original movie is in a different language so it was ""dubbed"" over in English.  Most of the time the characters lips don't match up with the words.  Usually that annoys me, but I didn't find this to be true with this movie.",1388880000,,418,4.2405063291139244

3832132,5,B0021GYDAE,I chose five stars for the movie story line. I've seen this movie before from Netflix DVD. It is an original story any family would enjoy. The only thing disappointing is this dvd doesn't have the option for english subtitles while the original finish spoken language. The overdubbed version makes it less enjoyable it's true artistic picture. I will not return this dvd but will still look for the original un-dubbed version.,1388188800,,426,4.930555555555555

I have only seen a handful of movies come out of Finnland, and i have liked all of them so far. The movie has a plot where people come together and happily helping out a child in need. The characters show generosity, understanding, personal moral growth, forgiveness, and love for fellow man.",1386201600,,410,4.554054054054054
3832136,5,B0021GYDAE,"This movie is amazing.  It is a foreign film translated in to English, but you will get so lost in the film that you won't even notice.  It has become one of family's favorites for Christmas.  It tells the story of a young boy that loses everything and learns to love and give despite it.  He grows up to become one of the most beloved icons of Christmas.  It's very, very sweet.  We rented it years ago, and then my husband found it on Amazon, and we just had to have it.",1385424000,,472,4.076086956521739
3832137,5,B0021GYDAE,"I have read the reviews and I can totally understand some of the negative comments as the bulk of them are based in subjective feelings.  Not everyone is tolerant of a dubbed movie.  Some have said the movie is sad and muddled.  The character of Santa as we know him is a phenomenal man who dedicates his life to the happiness of others.  This would have to be a man of extraordinary strength and compassion.  As the saying goes, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  The main character suffers through some tremendously difficult situations and comes out on the other side a strong good-hearted man.  As for the ending that some people seem to not understand, why are you wanting an explanation for a man in a sleigh flying across the sky being pulled by four flying reindeer?  There simply is NO explanation that can be given for that.  I took it to imply that the spirit of Christmas, that of love and giving, lives on in all our hearts.  My personal feeling is that he wasn't really physically there, but rather, his spirit was lingering and affecting the memories of all whom he touched.  I think this is a great movie that offers the viewer a chance to watch a version of Santa's origin that is not based in magic or fairy tales.  This is based in the kind heart of a good man who just wanted to make people happy.  Is it entirely believable?  No, not for those who will tear it apart wanting facts and figures to prove every theory.  But it certainly offers a very human quality to the legend for those who just want to experience a warm holiday smile.",1379376000,,1564,4.419580419580419

3832139,5,B0021GYDAE,"We caught this film incidentally last year. I have been looking to buy it ever since on BluRay. I was trying to get it directly from Finland, but was not having much luck. I was very happy to find a copy offered here in the US.
This version doesn't have all of the languages of the Finnish version... Swedish, Norwegian, Dannish. That is kind of a bummer for me since my wife speaks Swedish and my kids and I are learning Swedish. It would have been nice to have another movie to listen to in Swedish. Perhaps I can download just the swedish sound-track and make another version for playing on our Apple TV.

Anyhow, the movie is very charming although tinged with sadness. I think it has a lot more grist of life than the typical holiday movie, but I like that. The kids were fascinated and the film started lots of conversations for days.",1369958400,,840,4.384615384615385

I can't say that I've ever seen another Christmas movie like this one! It's an absolutely magical story and if you like 'different' kinds of heart warming movies at Christmastime, get this one. It's really one of a kind. I won't say much about the story because I can't describe it well enough in this length of time. I'm so glad I added this to my Christmas DVDs.

3832143,5,B0021GYDAE,"This foreign-produced film is overdubbed in English but it doesn't take away from the story.  It's a beautiful story about how Santa Clause came to be.  The focus of the story is the humanity and loss in one individual's life that drove him to love and kindness despite the somewhat unfair challenges he experiences.  The plot of the movie starts with the boy who lost his family one winter and subsequently came under the protection of the nearby villagers and finally under the care of a loner who was a carpenter.  Through the boy's experiences with the villagers and his caretaker (the carpenter) he becomes the individual we know as Santa Claus.  The additional material on the DVD describes the difficulty in making this movie in the elements to give it realism and is definitely worth watching as well. If you're looking for a good family-oriented flick to get you in the Christmas Spirit, then I highly recommend this one with a big bowl of popcorn.",1362787200,3,957,4.740963855421687

Every so often I am surprised by a film and 'Christmas Story' is just such a film! The story of old Saint Nick told from Finland perspective is a marvelous story that is sweet, but never sappy and really belies the whole Holiday film clich.

The story of Santa Claus is told as if we are watching a biography. The film gets my highest 5 star rating, but the DVD gets one star deducted for sloppy dubbing and no original language option. The film would have been better if it ended about a minute sooner too. The shot of the spirit Santa Claus driving off in his sleigh just seemed out of place in this otherwise very engrossing and heartwarming film. I know, I know...it's a ""holiday movie"", but this film is so much more than that and I think it would have spoken louder and been more profound had it showed us a little less.

This is a small grievance and the film will be in my yearly holiday viewing repertoire for years to come. The film runs about an hour and 20 minutes and shows you don't have to have an overly long film to develop characters or tell a complete story! If you like Christmas films (and I know you do!) this is one holiday film that should not be missed!

3832161,3,B0021GYDAE,"I was so disappointed and frustrated while watching this film. I was looking forward to seeing a film with a European flair. I was ready for an off-beat, unconventional, un-Americanized story of Santa. I enjoy foreign films very much, and eagerly anticipated watching some fine Finnish acting and dialogue.

There are two problems that I shall note:

1. The dubbing. (It IS disclosed in the Amazon description that it is dubbed, but I did not see that. I thought nobody dubbed films anymore!) The dubbing undermines the characters, the story, the entire film. I watched the original Finnish behind-the-scenes stuff on the DVD and the original Finnish trailer and got the sense that it was so much better than it could ever be with the dubbing. There is no option for subtitles of any sort. It's the dubbing or nothing. Not only is the dubbing poorly done, but I'm sure there are elements of the story lost in translation.

2. The story. To be fair, I have to take into consideration that much of the quality of the story, acting, etc. was lost due to the dubbing. I found the story meandering, uneven, and confusing. I didn't understand how the ending came about. The connections between the characters felt very odd a lot of the time. I don't really understand WHY Nikolas even sacrificed his life to making toys. The children even turn on him at one point, inexplicably. It was all rather bleak and muddling.

I will say that the scenery is breathtaking, absolutely. The costume design was lovely. The attempt to filming an unusual story about Santa was a great idea, but I feel it failed. I cannot even recommend this for children. I'm not sure they would like it. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this DVD now.

I would like to see this film with proper English subtitles and the original audio of Finnish.",1350604800,4,1818,4.633540372670807

Decent acting and a good story, however when his friend and his family are on the iced over pond and St. Nick goes flying overhead in the sleigh, I was disappointed.  There was no lead up during the movie to suggest that he had magical powers.  The movie really wasn't long enough to be able to develop this appropriately.  You go from St. Nick declaring this will be his last year delivering gifts to him zipping through the skies in a halo of stardust, smiling creepily, and the movie ends.  Story has a lot of potential, but the ending needs work.",1332374400,,610,4.410714285714286

3832179,4,B0021GYDAE,"Tonight I watched a Finnish version of Santa's childhood. I enjoyed the totally non-commercial version of Santa.
I have always loved the old-fashioned Santa and I think you will too. This is for older children or children with a good attention span.

It kind of reminded me of Shirley Temple's version of Heidi. A good story but not a lot of action. Never thought much about Santa's childhood so
this was a nice movie for me. It is not for the kids who can't live without video games but for the kids who like to read, enjoy simple things
and act older than they are. I will surely watch it again just before Christmas because I get entirely sick of the commercialism of Christmas
and long for the slower Christmas where you celebrate giving to the people you love because you love them not because you feel like you have to.

As you can tell I love Christmas and start watching holiday movies in July, (I hate summer). I hope you give this movie a chance when you are just wanting to relax
and are in no hurry but feel like stringing popcorn, and celebrating just living your life and looking back on Christmases past when you could believe
that life is more than rushing around. Hot cocoa would go with this too.

I know this is not the most exciting review but it made me slow down for a little while and just spend time by myself and remembering being a child who believed in Santa.

The costumes, the sets, and the art direction are all outstanding, and Mika Orasmaa's cinematography is literally stunning - several times I found myself smiling with childlike delight at the beauty of individual shots and scenes.  Leri Leskinen's musical score also adds to the magical ambience of the film without calling undue attention to itself.  And the performances are all just fine; I think the fact that the actors were all unfamiliar to me leant the film a certain veneer of plausibility.

In fact, my only quibble with the DVD presentation of the film is the fact that subtitles were not available.  Instead, the film was dubbed into English ... and a bit poorly, I might add, since the movement of the cast's lips did not always match the dialogue.  This would not have bothered me so much if I were a child - especially a youngster who had not yet learned to read! - but as an adult audience of one, I much would have preferred to have heard the actors' natural voices and read the English translations at the bottom of my screen.

That one minor and adult-specific detail aside, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Christmas Story"" and can't wait for the pleasure of watching it with my young godchildren when the holidays roll around again.

No, the story was heartwarming and emotional; an interesting take on the mythos of Saint Nick from young child to bearded gift giver. The acting was engaging as was the lovely wintery cinematography. The soundtrack fit the movie but was ultimately forgettable. Though billed as a ""family"" film, it is suited more for adults. It really didn't hold my children's interest for the entire running time.

3832198,3,B0021GYDAE,"I had no expectations of this film before watching it.  I didn't know the plot, actors, or anything else about it.  Take this review with these things in mind.

First the good:
1.  This is a heartwarming story about an orphan (Nikolas) and his search for ""belonging"".  It is heartbreaking as you see this child be uprooted time and time again, but also heartwarming as he finds a home with an eccentric, lonely carpenter.
2.  This is an original take on ""how Santa Claus came to be"" which was interesting.
3.  The scenery and cinematography are beautifully captured and seem ""magical"" and very festive for the holidays.

Now the bad:
1.  This is a foreign film.  Usually I have no issue with this except for when things are ""lost in translation"".  This movie is Finnish and the actors are as well.  I wish the producers of this film would've left well enough alone and just given us subtitles to read.  The English dub is HORRIBLE to say the least.  Not only do the voices not match with the actors words, but the voice overs seem bored, uninterested, and just plain uninspired.  This was very distracting and really took away from the movie and this sweet story.

Overall a nice holiday film.  I don't think it will come close to being a classic, but worth the time if you can ignore the bad dub.",1262649600,2,1297,4.497854077253219

What you see here is a telling of the story of Santa Claus, from his childhood as an orphan, trying to find his place in the world, to the Santa we all watch for each Christmas season.

It is very well-acted, with dubbing in English done so well that I barely noticed it had been dubbed from the original Finnish.  The fact that the movie was made by Finnish filmakers is a clue to how breathtakingly beautiful the scenery is.  You almost feel the chill of the snow-covered villages and Santa's frosty reindeer.  The bonus section of the DVD contains comments by actors and the filmkers that talk of problems they experienced such as temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius and spooked reindeer.

I've seen some really, really bad movies that run almost two hours, this one could and should have run ten minutes longer than it did. My second complaint is the ending. I can't go into it too much without giving anything away, so I'll just say that I had to guess what might have happened for the ending to take place. The visuals are absolutley gorgeous and should be watched for that alone. It was shot in Finland and dubbed in English. Someone pointed that it was annoying because the voices didn't match the lips.

3832202,4,B0021GYDAE,"A dubbed Finnish film about the origin of Santa Claus?  I must say I approached this DVD with a fair amount of skepticism.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, when it exceeded my expectations.  Once I got used to the often sloppy dubbing, I really enjoyed this film about the boyhood of Nikolas, who grew up to become the person we know as Santa Claus. Young Nikolas is orphaned at a young age and is taken to a village whose residents raise him like a foster child, going from home to home, until he eventually ends up with rather cruel guardian named Iisakki.  But Nikolas has a penchant for carving little wooden toys and leaving them on doorsteps on Christmas Eve, and once he is put to work in Iisakki's woodworking shop... well, the rest, as they say, is history.  It's a charming, believable and gently sentimental fantasy, well-acted and appropriate for all ages (though probably best appreciated by children 8 and up), with beautiful cinematography and even a decent music soundtrack.  You just have to deal with the dubbing, unless you find a subtitled version.",1261180800,,1073,4.772972972972973
3832203,3,B0021GYDAE,"This is the story of the man who became Santa Claus... no, not the real-life St. Nicholas. This constantly snowdrifted little movie is a fictionalized account of how an orphan child with a knack for woodcarving became the legendary bringer of presents -- and while it sometimes loses its depth in pursuit of the Santa Claus legend, it's a sweet, warm-hearted little movie with the aesthetics of a storybook.

Nikolas' (Jonas Rinne) parents and baby sister are killed in a sleigh accident when he's young, and nobody in the village can afford to adopt the quiet boy. So the village families come up with a plan: Nikolas will be passed from family to family over the next six years, with each transition being at Christmas. And since Nikolas has a knack for carving wood, every Christmas he leaves toys on the doorstep of the families who once showed him kindness.

Then at thirteen (played by Otto Gustavsson), he's handed off to Isaac (Kari Vnnen), a crotchety and cruel carpenter who initially treats him like a slave. But after Isaac discovers Nikolas' secret, he begins to warm to the strange, generous boy. And as Nikolas grows to manhood (Hannu-Pekka Bjrkman), he's left with a remote, frozen house and a workshop filled with toys -- and a dream that he's determined to make real, bringing countless children toys every Christmas.

""Christmas Story"" (original title: ""Joulutarina"") is a refreshing experience in a sea of schmaltzy made-for-TV movies and stupid Christmas comedies. It has a mellow homespun charm reflected in the poverty-stricken fishing village, log houses and layers of woolly clothing -- and there's no preachy message about the true meaning of Christmas (love/family/generosity/all that), just Nikolas displaying it as he slowly morphs into Santa Claus.

It's also pretty as a picture -- while there are some lovely shots of autumnal forests and fog-wrapped fishing boats, the real draw is the gorgeous pictures of little Finnish villages under a perpetual blanket of snow. The overall mood is an upbeat one, with a pleasant study of how the basic trappings of the popular fictional Santa Claus (the hat, the reindeer, the sleigh, the gifts) became a part of his legend. But it becomes darker and sadder as the lonely, generous man winds through the latter years of his life, only to have another upturn at the end.

One thing that is a problem: there is no Finnish soundtrack in this movie, just English subs and an English audio track dubbed by people who often didn't sound too enthusiastic. It actually was sometimes more fun to watch the movie with the sound turned off.

The child actors are thoroughly mediocre, but Bjrkman really throws himself wholeheartedly into his role -- he's jolly, generous and thoroughly devoted to his new goal. And he's got a beard that could The only problem is that when Nikolas reaches adulthood, his motives become rather murky -- it's not quite clear WHY he becomes so determined to devote his life to Christmas, toymaking and all kids in the region.

And while most of the actors are only briefly in the story, the few who stand out are excellent Vnnen gives a well-drawn performance as Isaac, who makes you hate his character, then pity him, then want to hug him; Mikko Kouki is quite good as Nikolas' best buddy.

""Christmas Story's"" English dub hampers it, but that can't erase some solid acting, lovely scenery, and a pleasant little made-up story about Santa Claus' origins. A nice yuletide movie, if not a classic.",1261180800,,3486,4.896610169491526

The story of Santa Claus is told so matter of fact, that I felt like I was watching a ""regular"" movie! The only thing that keeps me from giving this a full 5 stars is the dubbing is a little off(unfortunately the original language option is not included) and that I think the film would have been better if it ended about a minute sooner. The shot of the spirit Santa Claus driving off in his sleigh, just took away all the realism that this film was giving me in so much abundance.

3832205,4,B0021GYDAE,"This is Northern Europe's version of how the Christmas figure of Santa Claus came into being.  Who knew that Santa was an orphan?

The movie is dubbed in English so the lip movements don't match the words which can be slightly distracting but does not away too much from the movie.  There is a complete absence of any religious meaning to Christmas other than just a holiday celebrated every winter.  But it is a wonderful story of wanting to give back to others when they have been generous to you.  The orphan boy makes good.

This is not a razzle-dazzle Hollywood movie loaded with special effects.  In fact, there are practically none in the movie other than the very last scene.  It is a simple story with a simple message.

There are some beautiful shots of winter scenes which adds to the seasonal flavor of the movie.

Christmas has many dimensions and relates differently to a variety of people.  This is the secular version where it really is just about giving to say ""Thank You!"" to others rather than having any deeper spiritual meaning.  If that is what the holiday is all about to you, this is your kind of Christmas movie.

There's a lengthy bonus feature all about the physical extremes endured by the cast and crew in order to make this unusual film. Interestingly, the cast and filmmakers are subtitled in the documentary so you get to hear some of the voices without the dubbing.

The film is dubbed, by quite well, especially by John Turturro as the woodworking master who seems frightening at first and becomes sympathetic later, but always in a very belivable way. I could not get away from the resemblance of the onscreen actor to Gene Simmons!

For example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Santa-Clause-3-The-Escape-Clause/dp/B000OLGCIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Santa Clause 3 The Escape Clause</a>&nbsp;(2006),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deck-the-Halls/dp/B000UX798I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deck the Halls</a>&nbsp;(2006),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-With-the-Kranks/dp/B0007A0F4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas With the Kranks</a>&nbsp;(2004),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Surviving-Christmas/dp/B0006JMLPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Surviving Christmas</a>&nbsp;(2004), and, most recently,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Santa-Baby/dp/B000VKKV30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Santa Baby</a>&nbsp;(2007) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Christmases/dp/B001CTA1UM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Christmases</a>&nbsp;(2008). And that doesn't count other holiday lumps of coal starring Tom Arnold, Kelsey Grammer and Matthew McConaughey.

My point is that this film, with its snowy lush cinematography and original storyline, isn't without its flaws. However, you will come away feeling inspired by the result, rather than feeling cheated once again by another made-for-TV plot, lame acting and sophomoric humor.

Jen Johans' review for Film Intuition does an excellent job of capturing what makes this foreign film so special. The following excerpt nicely sums up why you should give the movie a chance:

""However, despite its melancholic opener and general audience reluctance to foreign films, this uplifting PG-rated movie is one I urge parents to seek out to offer a new alternative to the primarily commercial approach of Santa Claus movies.

""A beautiful work filled with the ingredients that make our classics including A Christmas Carol, Nutcracker and other holiday movies so endearing, director Juha Wuolijoki's Story also garnered prestigious accolades in time for its DVD debut including a seal of approval by The Dove Foundation and an All-Star honor by the well-respected Kids First! Coalition for Quality Children's Media.""

Rating: Four stars.",1260835200,26,2842,7.890282131661442
3832210,5,B0021GYDAE,"Christmas Story is a unique interpretation of the origin of Santa Claus that is different from anything I have seen. Produced in Finland, the story begins with parents leaving their young son in a small house on the edge of a lake while they take his infant sister to the village to see a doctor. Tragedy strikes and the boy becomes an orphan. That boy becomes Santa Claus.

I won't mention anymore of the story because I don't want to spoil it for anyone but what is unique about the story is that rather than relying on elves and magic flying reindeer and a mysterious workshop in the North Pole the story presents a very human Santa interested in honoring his lost parents and sister and those who have been kind to him when he was in need. The magic of Santa is as much in who Santa is rather than his delivering of toys on Christmas Eve which he also does.

The movie was shot in Finland with a Finnish cast. The filming was done at times in frigid conditions. Some filming was done in Lapland. The fact that the film was shot in conditions that we associate with Santa Claus adds to the film.  The scenery is amazing as well.

The movie has ""Family Approved"" and ""Kids First"" symbols on the box and I agree it is a good movie for children.  My only two concerns would be that this Santa is different from the Santa Claus we learn about in the United States with eight reindeer led by Rudolf and elves helping Santa with the presents. So if you have young children brought up with that interpretation of Santa Claus there may be questions. Also, as mentioned, death occurs in this movie. Some young children may be uncomfortable with the idea of Santa's parents and sister dying.

My only complaint is that while the film is in English the actors spoke Finnish and their lines were later dubbed in English.  As a result on a few occasions the actors mouths stopped moving while they were still speaking. The dubbing is done well but it must be hard to dub when you are changing languages. There is no option to watch the film in its original Finnish with English subtitles.  There is a ""The Making of Christmas Story"" feature with the actors speaking Finnish and with English subtitles. I wish the movie had that option as well.

This is a great movie worth adding to anyone's Christmas Collection.",1260662400,17,2303,4.464285714285714
3832211,4,B0021GYDAE,"I viewed this Finnish film (overdubbed tastefully with English) with my wife and children a few hours ago, and it is my opinion that this is one of the best Christmas movies I have ever seen, though I confess I've never been much on Christmas movies, aside from the traditional cartoons like Rudolf, Frosty, etc. This movie has a much different slant from most of the holiday movies in that it is not so unbelievable as most (until the end).

It should be known that if you watch the film with kids, this movie is not simply a happy-go-lucky ""Merry Christmas"" sort of film, but starts off with tragedy, ends with melancholy, and has many moments of emotional intensity throughout. My wife and I both were moved to tears a few times, though it did not seem to have quite as much of an effect on my two small children (ages 9 and 7). It certainly wasn't traumatic to them in any way, but it may have caused them to be thoughtful of how fortunate they are, and to reflect on the preciousness of close relationships.

I would recommend this to any family with children, without regard to religion, since no religious component is promulgated. It is simply a lovely little film.",1260662400,,1173,4.528301886792453
3832212,4,B0021GYDAE,"I wasn't sure how to classify this film. On the one hand, it's more imaginative than the usual holiday fare, and the production values are good.

On the other hand, I would have no idea this film was supposed to be set in Finland from watching it. The town the young protagonist, Nicholas, lives in looks like a ranch in Texas. The Dickensian-like master who adopts the boy is Russian, and everyone wears pilgrim hats. These are things that make you go ""hmmm"".

However, the story is heart-warming. The breakout character is the Russian carpenter who takes charge of the boy. At times the Russian reminds me of Hagrid. Nicholas is a sympathetic character who becomes obsessed with making toys for the children in his fishing village.

3832213,4,B0021GYDAE,"I ordered this through the Vine program. I was intrigued by the description. I just finished watching it and I was fairly impressed. Other reviewers have given the details and ""spoilers"" of the movie. I am glad that I watched it before I let my daughter see it (she is 4). The tale is dark at times and I think is more appropriate for slightly older children.  I think this could also confuse children based on what they know/believe about the modern-day Santa Claus - and the fact that there are different stories available.

I agree with one reviewer who said that there were gaps in the movie that could have been developed better.  I thought some of the movie was abrupt and you didn't quite understand the entire ""story"" or relationship between characters. Also the ending was abrupt. Nikolas went from delivering presents at his last Christmas to showing up the next year in the sky with his reindeer.  The viewer is left to figure out what transpired. Was he really there in the sky? Was it just his spirit - meaning that of giving? Was it just a memory?

Overall, I think it is worth watching. The acting is great. The voice-overs are very good. I watched it on a HD TV (large one) and didn't find it distracting at all (most dubbed movies are distracting for me).  But I did find that the one character, Nikolas' best friend, needed a different voice actor - having a slight New York accent detracted from the story.

I will be showing this to our daughter in a few years....",1260403200,,1484,4.4944237918215615
3832214,4,B0021GYDAE,"I watched this movie with a friend of mine.  I enjoyed it, she did not.  The reason we disagreed was simple.  This is not your traditional Hollywood Christmas movie, and that's what she was hoping for.  I, on the other hand, really enjoyed the story and liked the fact that it had a different feel to it then what we've come to expect from a Christmas movie.  There is no jolly ""ho ho ho"" and it has a more dark, somber underlying edge to it. In fact, there are times where it is just plain depressing, however I am not a reviewer that recaps the movie as I feel that's what the product page is for, so I'll simply say I think this movie is well worth the view.  But if you're looking for Christmas glitz, this is not the movie for you and I do not recommend this for children under 10.",1260144000,4,786,4.104575163398692
3832215,2,B0021GYDAE,"I received this DVD through the Vines program and immediately set it up to view the video.  After all, what better time of year to see the origins of Saint Nick?

If you have a high def or large screen TV, this video can be distracting as the voices are dubbed in and as such, the facial movements do not match up with the voices.  While not a big issue, it is distracting and becomes more so the larger your TV is.

This is a very sad story that does not particularly inspire.  The movie attempts to explain the childhood of the person who would become Saint Nick and casts him as an orphan after his father, mother, and sister perish on thin ice while attempting to go to a doctor in a snow storm.  Nicholas is then cast about from one family to another in a poor fishing town because no one can afford to adopt him and provide enough food to support him and their families.  He eventually winds up with an outsider who initially is cruel to him, but then warms up to him.

After 72 minutes of running time, Nicholas (an old man now) disappears on a Christmas Day after delivering presents for his last time due to his age.  He then magically reappears on the next Christmas (with no explanation of how or why this happens) driving a sleigh up in the sky and wishing everyone a merry Christmas.

This is not a film that leaves you feeling good; rather, it leaves you a bit confused and depressed at the end.  Perhaps if the producers had made this a 90 minute film instead of a 78 minute film they might have been able to fix the film, but then again, maybe not.  Perhaps it is more merciful that the film is not any longer.",1260144000,3,1626,4.226537216828479

3832217,5,B0021GYDAE,"Movies like this one make me wonder what other great films have I missed from other countries.

The story opens with a little boy named Nicholas, orphaned after his family fell through some ice at night. The brief scene opened a flood of questions from my 4yr old, but it was easy to handle since we've already discussed death and the afterlife with our son. (Not sure if that counts as a spoiler, but I thought some parents might want to be prepared for any questions.) The other villagers decide to take turns looking after him; he spends one year with each family, and then moves to a new household on Christmas day. During this time, Nicholas starts to make toys for the children, as a way to say ""thank-you"" for caring for him.

However, after six years, there is a food shortage in the village. The families can no longer take care of Nicholas, but a carpenter offers to take him instead. The carpenter, Isaac, is a mean-tempered man that wants to put Nicholas to work in his woodshop. He even renames Nicholas, ""I will call you Brat!"" Despite his nasty personality, Isaac is able to teach Nicholas the wood-working trade.

When the year is up, Isaac learns about the toys that Nicholas makes for the village children. Isaac tells him that he too lost his family, and explains why he is so mean to children. That disclosure changes the relationship between the carpenter and the boy.

As Nicholas grows up, he begins to resemble the Santa image we are familiar with. We see him put together his team of reindeer, and we learn why he wears a red suit. (The entire scene with the reindeer had my son laughing his head off.) Unfortunately, there is more sadness in the adult life of Nicholas, which only strengthens his resolve to uphold his tradition of handing out presents. I liked the supporting chracters, and the different dimension they gave to the Santa story. The ending was quite a surprise.

This is a great family movie with a beautiful story that will entertain all ages.
