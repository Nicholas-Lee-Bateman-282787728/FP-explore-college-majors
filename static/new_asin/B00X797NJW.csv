7160070,5,B00X797NJW,"As a child you watch the princess movies and how they save the day. Bla bla bla. To me the villians were the most important people. So the fact that this movie surrounded the thought of villians was a good twist. The time seemed to change a lot and it seemed to go from Sunday to Friday in a day??? possible how? But you connect the dots. Dove Cameron and Mitchell Hope seemed to click which was needed, but I didn't like all that romance, I know that its still a princessy cheesy love movie cause it's Disney, but seriously, ""My love for you is ridiculous"" wow. I loved it other than that. I recommend it to anyone and everyone even the boys.",1438300800,2,643,4.235772357723577
7160071,5,B00X797NJW,After reading Isle of the Lost book I couldn't wait for the film to come out and I was not disappointed. Was well worth checking three different stores before locating a copy.  I didn't have to read on the DVD box that the director of the musical numbers in this movie was the same person who worked music numbers in High School Musical.  I love the story line of the kids of classic Disney characters brought to life.  The only thing bad I would have to say about the movie is the look of a few of the adult characters like Cruella De Ville and Belle as  both the actress that played Cruella in the live action 101 Dalmations and 102 Dalmations movies as well as those who play her in the theme parks looks closer to animated character than the woman picked for this film.  The park Belles can also be the same when comparing to this movie Belle even if 16 years have passed since the movie events.  having seen stage shows of Beauty and the Beast think they did good with the un curse human King Beast.,1438300800,2,1004,4.257894736842105
7160072,5,B00X797NJW,I love this movie! It is extremely good! And to all of the people who give it a 1 because it is either a disgrace to the original fairy tales or because Mal sings most of the songs in the movie you should all go get lives! Take a look at the remake of sleeping beauty movie Maleficent that movie changed parts of the original Disney fairy tale sleeping beauty. When a movie is based on a Disney original fairy tale then Disney is allowed to make each movie different the movies based on the original movies made by Disney do not always have to be little mini versions that completely follow the original Disney fairy tales. So get over it! It is a really good movie!,1438300800,2,666,4.251968503937008
7160073,5,B00X797NJW,"I admit it. I'm older  than the age group that this was pitched for. At 28 I have no kids, except for when I watch my two cousins, who are 12 and 7. Now moving on. I wasn't much of a fan of the HSM trilogy, or Frozen (admit it, everyone has had enough of that!). I thought this movie was going to be lame and cliche, but it changed my mind. The twist on the old Disney classics. The music seemed kind of last minute, but fit the plot line just right. 9/10.",1438300800,105,456,3.851063829787234

7160075,5,B00X797NJW,"As a giant kid at heart, teacher, and Cast Member I was so excited for this movie to come out. Obviously, my expectation for a Disney Channel Original Movie was not that high but then again look at how well High School Musical took off (even with the rocky dialogue in the first film). I couldn't wait to see this new perspective on some of Disney's most infamous villains and I have to say this completely exceeded my expectations. The music, choreography, and actors are all phenomenal. Honestly, my favorite part though is all of the costuming and accessories. It is a total blast to look at other characters and guess their origin character by the costumes. Every time you watch it there is something new to notice. I'm not saying it has the most believable plotline (there are definitely some flaws) but it is definitely an empowering Disney Channel movie that tells us we are responsible for our actions and no one else. We decide. It's definitely a lesson I want my kids to learn. And as Mal so kindly hinted that we would be seeing more of them......I cannot wait!",1438128000,61,1072,4.588541666666667

Smaller children may be scared by the portrayal of the villains (one of them turns into a dragon at one point), but highly recommended for ages 7 and up.

7160090,5,B00X797NJW,"I rented this movie to watch with a friend. The movie is surprisingly great! It's a live action Disney movie focusing on the children of both the heroes and the villains. Four lucky kids(of villains) get a second chance and are allowed to attend the big prep school that all of the heroes' children attend. There are singing numbers of course, it is a Disney musical. My favorite songs are Rotten to the Core and the acappella version of Be Our Guest. Considering the actors and actresses are all younger to fit their roles, they do an amazing job at acting.

Seeing the kids of the characters I watched growing up is really cute! There are only a handful mentioned though, at least in the first movie, and I would like to see more children of the other characters we missed out on. Overall, it's a cute little movie, especially for the younger audience. But I do like it, and I would recommend it to people of all ages as well.",1532304000,,928,4.426900584795321

There's no plot, it's just a bunch of teenie boppers talking about their hair and what they want to do with it to be in the cool crowd, like dye it purple. I gave it 2 stars because it made me nauseous, but thank god I stopped watching after 20 minutes before I puked, which would have been 1 star. And it made me feel sorry for those poor kids who might actually enjoy it, about 1 out of every 4 in those painful freshman and sophomore years of high school. Yes, if you actually like this movie, I really DO have pity on you, and don't worry, you will grow out of it.

7160139,2,B00X797NJW,"If you don't want to read my full thoughts on the movie, scroll down to the bottom for a quick summary.

This movie is perhaps the worst Disney movie I've ever seen. The plotline is trite, and over done. I swear I lost brain cells just watching it. The lipsynching is terrible, and the songs are just mediocre at best. The only reason I didn't give it less stars is because Amazon won't let you give zero stars, the choreographed scenes are actually really decent, and the actors ARE talented. Overall, a waste of time, money, and good talent.

Honestly, what I think upsets me most about this movie is the fact that it could have been good. It had the potential to be a decent movie, it really did. There was a good premise. ""What happens when the children of Disney villains meet and socialize with the children of those their parents tried to destroy?"" But they tried to shove so many freaking plot points into one movie. ""Love conquers all"", ""Don't judge someone based on their looks"", ""Good always wins in the end"", ""Get the fairy godmother wand to free your parents that you fear"", ""We were never shown love as children and were abused regularly, but we still love our parents even though we have no reason to"", ""magic has been retired in the name of technology"" (I really, REALLY, hate this plot point. It's such a cop out for a FANTASY based plot) just to name a few.  With everything they try and shove in your face it just winds up coming across as rushed, murky, and forced.

They treat the villains (the Disney classic villains) as the butt of a joke. The children are supposed to be afraid of them, but I don't understand how anyone can find them more than washed up wannabes that couldn't fill a thimble with their menace. THESE ARE CLASSIC VILLAINS, and they're reduced to that old high school jock at the bar. You know the one. That one that complains that he could've been the big cheese and gotten out of that Podunk town he lives in, if only he hadn't of blown out his knee cap in the last quarter of the ""big game"". So, he sits at the bar, refusing to move on with his life and make something more of himself, and regales tales of ""the good old days"" to anyone who will listen. Which is unforgivable, considering the actors they had behind them have more talent than that and the villains themselves are A rank in the Disney universe.

Now onto the kids. While the actors are talented and you can tell they're really trying to make a crap sandwich look appetizing, there's no real reason for them to act the way they do. Half of the cast has no purpose (the romantic rival is barely worth batting an eye at). And the chemistry between the main couple is forced, at best. They have no reason to be afraid of their parents once they leave the island. NONE. They even acknowledge that there's no way for them to reach the children. The hatred of the ""good guys"" children towards the ""bad guys"" children is ridiculous and makes the good guys look terrible. What kind of message are they trying to send here? It's ok to hate on someone who had no choice in regards to their parent? Yea. That seems totally reasonable *eye roll*. Sins of the father and all. And it's not even like they truly resolve this plot point either. You think saving a hardcore bigot's life is going to change the mind of said bigot in the blink of an eye? NO. Not when said bigot has literally been raised from birth to hate your parent and by default you. That kind of indoctrination doesn't just dissapear over night. They could've made an effort to at least show that the dunderhead was going through their own change in perception through the course of the movie, but no. That's to much effort.

The nitty gritty of the whole mess: Ramshackle plot slapped together with more loose ends than your grandmothers sewing basket, made for the sole purpose of cashing in on childhood nostalgia. Villains are trash. Story is trash. If you're looking for that Disney magic, you won't find it here, look some where else.",1520726400,,4003,4.461748633879782

7160156,5,B00X797NJW,"This is ""very Disney"" - but also fun. What happens to Disney's villains and heroes when they grow up and live ""happily ever after""? Are the villains' kids just as evil as their parents? In an experiment, when the son of Belle & the Beast is made king at 18, he decrees that they're going to bring over four kids from ""the Isle"" (the magically enchanted island that keeps villains prisoner) to Auradon Prep, to show them that there's a different way of life than living ""evilly"".

The kids brought over are the daughters of Maleficent and the Evil Queen from Snow White, and the sons of Cruella de Ville and Jafar. The movie skillfully portrays the pressure the kids feel to live up to their parents' expectations, especially Mal, who is being pressured by her mother, Maleficent (oh, it is delicious to see Kristin Chenoweth playing evil for a change!), to find a spellbook and a wand that will free The Isle from its prison status. Can the ""Kids from the Isle"" prove that what's inside can triumph over their upbringing? Well - this is Disney, so what do you think? ;)",1518048000,,1069,4.538860103626943

7160375,2,B00X797NJW,"I plead Prime Day exhaustion!  Instead of reading reviews & doing all my normally thorough research before purchasing I stupidly clicked buy!  This would probably be cute for a child like my 11yr old niece but not what I was expecting at all.  I had just recently watched a really good movie that had a young cast of various ages with enhanced or superhuman powers that I can't remember the name of at the moment but ended in a way that clearly meant a sequel was to follow, I did make write that title in my datebook.  I apparently had that movie in the back of my mind after a long frustrating Prime Day when purchasing this movie!  I learned a valuable lesson though, never do my Prime Day shopping on my app!  Of course since watching this I've seen these Descendants movies everywhere when I never heard of them before.  I was trying to delete this off my Fire TV so I just figured I'd give a quick review.  I was disappointed in the acting of some really great actresses but I guess that this is just a genre I'm not used to since I don't have children.  I have watched my fair share of TV & movies with my nieces & nephew but these last few years I've extremely ill with Late Stage Lyme (my bed is my world) so I haven't been the aunt that bakes, crafts, watches Disney...",1502409600,,1279,4.25206611570248

7160403,2,B00X797NJW,"If you're looking for a cute, non-sexy fairytale retelling, I'd go with Ever After High. This movie is about 14-15 year olds, but the costumes and dance moves try to be edgy and cool at the cost of innocence and sweetness. The music and lyrics are pop, simplistic and repetitive, so nothing really cool there, and the plot is straightforward with no twists. Boring for YA, and not good attitudes for little kids to be watching. And the animation, as you might expect from a Disney Channel movie, is straight outta the 90s. Dove Cameron and some of the other characters clearly sing well, but that's the only good point.",1500681600,,619,4.636363636363637

7160425,4,B00X797NJW,"I got this for myself (at 44) when Amazon was running a $0.99 special on the rental, and I liked it.  The first five or so minutes had me regretting my purchase because it seemed like a childish made-for-TV movie, and I thought it would really only appeal to younger kids.  However, as the movie went on, it became more appealing to me.  It is a good movie for kids as there is no ""adult"" content or anything inappropriate, but it became much less ""childish"" after the first few minutes and I think it will appeal to adults, too.

I like Disney movies and cartoons, and I thought it was a cool idea to have a show about the kids of characters that I've watched over the years.  It's a fun show.  It's not a highly polished movie with top-tier actors, but the younger actors in this are certainly talented.  They act over the top at times, but I think that's just because that's what the movie called for.

I'd recommend it as a nice movie for the family or just for yourself (perhaps on a lazy weekend).",1499558400,16,1003,4.297872340425532

7160575,1,B00X797NJW,"The Devil That You Know: This Is A Children's Film That Promotes The Luciferian Archetype.

The film ostensibly deals with an ethical dilemma. Will the teenage children of sinister Disney characters choose to follow in their evil parents footsteps,or decide to embrace their goodness and save the magical kingdom of Auradon.

HARMFUL PSYCHOLOGICAL THEMES
The male character Ben tells the daughter of Maleficient her that he can 'see goodness when he looks into her eyes, not evil' When he asks her if she loves him, Mal says that she doesn't know what it feels like to love; Ben says he might be able to teach her.

This particular theme is promoting the co-dependent idea of winning the love of a nasty hearted female through the power of romantic love. It is a psychologically unhealthy message & unfortunately children who have experienced abusive parenting will be highly susceptible to this dysfunctional notion. Any relationship based on one person trying to fix the other is doomed to failure. Those who make it their business to try to fix others are not empaths, they are people who were abused as children, their need to heal others stems from an internal sense of shame-they regard themselves as not being worthy of a normal (non-abusive) partner. Males who unconsciously seek nasty women as romantic partners are unconsciously trying to mend an inadequate mother.

* The movie is intentionally being marketed to very young children. It's shades of grey philosophy is too complex & confusing for young minds to process-it is developmentally inappropriate. A definite boundary between good and evil needs to be presented to very young children - it needs to be represented in a stark way, as in the contrast between black and white.

HARMFUL SPIRITUAL THEMES
This movie glorifies villains and it encourages very young children to explore dark energy. The general public is so brainwashed and desensitized these days that they will not understand that this movie is openly mocking God by glorifying the Luciferian archetype - how many parents will even realize that what they are putting in front of their children's minds is blatant mind control. The film makers are pushing a satanic Gnostic belief system onto innocent unsuspecting minds. Gnosticism teaches that Lucifer is not bad - just misunderstood. This philosophy is not harmless,it is an occult inversion of Christian teaching. Disney would never have been able to get away with this a few decades ago but anything goes these days. Early experience has an important influence on adult behaviour so when the young children watching this sort of material grow up they will easily accept occult and illuminati type themes due to the fact they have sentimental & warm childhood memories of films like this one.

* Disney recently released the sequel to this film it's called Decendants 2 Long Live Evil. The title says it all - when you blow the Christian spiritual foundations out from underneath a culture it leaves a void.",1484784000,,2990,5.018145161290323

I was trying to find a movie that 12 year old girls could enjoy, while I would feel comfortable (not hiding in the back blushing because of too-mature scenes).  Descendants was the perfect fit!  The social scene isn't different in a fairy tale world -- there are still cliques and hierarchies, just with the added benefit of magic.  The movie was clean, but had enough flirting and crushing to keep stuff interesting. The only part of the movie that really fell below expectations was the lip syncing.  The music wasn't bad, but the fact that the singing was so obviously fake detracted from the overall effect.  Still, I'm really glad I bought the DVD because I think we'll be watching it again and again.",1475884800,,761,4.649253731343284

The characterization is so believable and all the actors are so so good. Kristin Chenoweth is amazing as always, and the newer actors as the Villains' Kids are amazing raw talent. The premise and storyline are well thought out and it flows very naturally. In my opinion this is so much better than your classic High School Musical because while it may be in a fantasy world it has so much more relevance to our everyday lives. It also isn't too cheesy with the moral background. The Villains' Kids are accepted even with brightly colored hair and flashy (AMAZING) clothes. Gotta say, I am sad they don't make the character costumes for Mal in adult sizes or I would get all of her clothes, she's my fave.",1475712000,3,882,4.484472049689441

What really drew me in at first was seeing Kristin Chenoweth listed in the cast as Maleficent no less! This movie answers the main question which would be: ""What really happened to all of those villains after the end of the previous films?""

I enjoyed how the story-line continued off from where the book ended, but did not immediately give all of the reason behind Ben's proclamation. Reading the book by Melissa De La Cruz gave a better insight into parts of the movie, but the film stands on its own feet alone.

Definitely worth watching.",1475366400,4,631,4.575221238938053

The premise is cute, despite the unrealistic aspects (this is part of a disney fairy tale - expecting full realism is, well, unrealistic). You do get emotionally invested in the characters, and the content is modernized enough to be relevant to today's age.

7160868,5,B00X797NJW,"When my sister's DVR died and she had to get a new one from the cable company, my 7-year-old niece's only concern was losing the copy of ""Descendants"" they had recorded. I bought this disc to replace the lost digital copy and to give her something to watch in the car on longer trips -- and it has been played almost as many times as the digital copy.

The basic story is ""new classic"" Disney; moral lessons presented in a highly entertaining manner, with surprisingly good acting and some musical numbers that I actually don't mind getting caught in my head from time to time. Although pitched to young ""tweens,"" Descendants is written and performed well enough to remain entertaining for adults -- a good thing, since my niece has had me (and/or her other grownups) watch it literally several dozen times in its entirety, plus still keeps ""Rotten to the Core"" in her iTunes playlist.

While my niece enjoys the dancing, music, and fun of living in a magic land, her grownups like the fact that there are some very simple, basic morals being presented both religion-free AND in a non-cookie-cutter manner. Not only is it made obvious why being good is better than being bad, it's also shown that being too full of yourself is not good; that assuming superiority because you're ""good"" instead of ""bad"" can lead ""bad guys"" being better people in general; that judging people without knowing them, based on what other people have done, can lead to wrong assumptions; that it's a good thing to remain true to yourself AND be part of a larger group; and that every person has their own set of talents and capabilities that they should embrace and not bury just to be popular (or to hook up with the popular kids).",1473292800,,1709,4.636963696369637

But it was all the talk among her classmates - most of them dressing as Mal & Evie for Halloween parties and trick-or-treating this past Fall.  So I read the book and decided to give it a try - and we all ended up loving it!  It's a super creative twist on classic Disney.  It is a neat transition from one generation to another - and I realized while watching it with her that she hasn't even seen some of the movies you must know in order to understand who their parents are!  Oops!  Sure, there are some things that could have been done differently to make it more perfect, but it's a cute movie and story line.

As they spent there, learning to be the opposite (you know, good is the opposite of bad), their parents, just being villains, had other ideas.
Mal and her pals were tasked by them to get the Fairy Godmothers magic wand and use its power to return the villains to their former glory and get revenge on their enemies.
However, after arriving in Auradon, these four villain kids were soon beginning to love the friendliness of the natives and the sugary treats in this new land.
They soon find themselves struggling between enjoying their new life in Auradon and carrying out their mission.
When that time came for Mal and the others to make their move on Fairy Godmothers wand during Bens coronation, it wasn't Mal who took the wand and cause the madness, but it was Fairy Godmothers own daughter, Jane.
When that just happened, the barrier over the Isle was broken, magic return to the villains, letting Maleficent to escape. She turned into an epic fire-breathing dragon, terrorizing the entire kingdom of Auradon, all while claiming the wand as her own.
But Mal, Evie, Carlos, and Jay began to stood together as one and it was Mal who won the epic final battle and wielded the wand, and everything returned to normal. In the end, Mal, Evie, Carlos, and Jay decided that good was better than evil for it was Mals power for good that was greater than her moms talent for evil. And now, these four villain-turned-hero kids were now back at their studies at Auradon Prepand their new life in Auradon.

It was like Kenny Ortega (the die wanted to make another Michael Jackson song and dance video but with Disney kids instead of being able to utilize the choreographic style invented for Michael Jackson. It doesn't work when it isn't Michael Jackson. The dancing looks hokey like The Thriller video with clean teenagers, over zealous teens I instead of cool zombies. We've all seen almost the exact dance steps before, and they were awesome in the 1980s, but not now on kids who weren't even born then. The big name actors in this movie overact. The storyline could have been interesting but the script is dull and predictable and the songs as maudlin as Free Willy.  Also the story tries way too hard to cast regardless of race and handicap, which is noble but confusing for an audience who has an exact picture of what these characters already looked like from previous Disney movies. Further, do we really need to teach one more generation of girls that is better to have a prince fall in love with them at 16, then be their interesting selves?",1464739200,,1051,4.650537634408602

I enjoyed most of the songs. Enough so, that I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this movie since I got it.

7161246,5,B00X797NJW,"I purchased this movie mainly for my 7 year old daughter.  We all sat down and watched it as a family and everyone really enjoyed it.  The story focuses around the struggles the villains' kids go through when they have to decide between following their evil parents' paths or choosing to forge their own path.  The main character is Mal, daughter of Maleficent.  She ended up being my daughter's favorite character.  Mal along with the other three villain kids are tasked with stealing the Fairy Godmother's wand to free the evil island so they can take over Aurodon.  I think this is a good movie for kids to watch and the message that you can choose your own path is an important one.  The costuming, music and choreography are very good in this movie and it is visually appealing to watch.  I would highly recommend this movie for the younger crowd, knowing that it can also be enjoyed as a family.",1461888000,17,901,4.552795031055901

While there a few slightly more mature things (the word ""flirt"" for example) and there are ""love"" themes, the main message is to think independently and follow your heart to do what's right and make positive decisions in life, no matter what others (even family!) are wrapped up in. It's an engaging movie with really hip dance routines and music that resonates with current generation of youngsters. And the basic cast of characters is really neat - figuring out who is who, and seeing how all the generations of characters relate. It's just a fabulous movie. Highly recommend. Watch it with them so you can discuss anything that comes up throughout the storyline.",1461715200,,705,4.8347107438016526

Wish the leading star hadn't had so much plastic surgery already... don't feel a 16 year old with botox injections (or whatever in her lips) and nose job is a good example for young impressionable youth.

I was afraid it might not arrive on time, but it did. As far as the movie, it is a good story for children and adults as well. My granddaughter told me (she is 8) that it showed that people showed be given a chance, everyone has a right to make their own choices in life, and not be marked just because of who they are related to or expected to become. She is one smart cookie, if I do say so myself (not prejudiced one bit-ha ha). I think this is a movie old and young could watch.",1461196800,2,647,4.023255813953488

7161541,3,B00X797NJW,"My nine year old liked it (though I suspect mostly because now she could talk with her friends about it), my six year old who usually enjoys the same movies as her older sister said it was boring and left half way through. I thought it was only okay. I was looking forward to seeing it and felt let down. (spoiler alert) The villains were more comical than scary which I think detracted a lot from the story. I mean the main plot is that the villains are so bad and scary that they have to be exiled to an island to prevent them from wreaking havoc. Sure the evil queen can turn into a dragon - one so meek it's defeated in a staring contest. There were a lot of weak plot points like this too. Also, even though my older daughter liked it, she was confused by the fact that the evil island was so full of children who were uncared for which she thought was unrealistic that all these good and understanding characters would exile and neglect innocent children in the first place. The movie indirectly showed that trials and tribulations help build character and kids who grow up pampered and lacking challenges are prone to be spoiled and selfish - but the story never connects the dots so kids really don't ever quite make it to what could have been an excellent moral lesson.",1453075200,,1278,4.373949579831932

7161545,4,B00X797NJW,"Well-written (Disney style) and pretty well acted. Fun with minimal objectionable elements. You love the characters after you get to know them.
Be advised...this show has some redeeming value. Rejects evil. Rejects revenge. Undermined by some elements that promote self-determination in the absence of a moral perspective based on something greater than themselves.

Romantic and Humanistic with some redemptive elements without any acknoledgement of something outside of their plane of existence.",1453075200,2,497,6.0

7161558,5,B00X797NJW,"Ordered this movie for my two kids, ages 9 and 11, and they loved it.  I have to admit that I also loved it.  I like the way they took all of the villains' children and gave them a chance to be good.  My kids are named after Disney characters, so this was extra fun for us. Yes, my wife is crazy and named our kids after cartoons, but whatever - we love our Disney! I highly recommend this movie if you have a few hours to spare.  <<<Long Live Evil>>>",1452470400,,451,3.923076923076923
7161559,5,B00X797NJW,"I admit that I got the idea to watch the first Disney Descendants film after unexpectedly catching the tail end of the Descendants 2 film less than 4 hours ago and deciding by one of the dragon scenes of this film to check out the first Descendants. Additionally, curiosity influenced me  enough to watch it as both an aspiring writer for plot ideas on connecting this series to Ever After High and simply just to watch it as a fantasy type film with a happy ending.  The Descendants film involves a plot where Ben (Mitchell Hope) successfully convinces his parents who are now queen and king of the land of Auradon Belle (Keegan Connor Tracy) and Beast (Dan Payne) to allow the following children into Auradon Prep School;Mal (Dove Cameron) daughter of Malificent (Kristin Chenoweth has featured in such films as 12 Men of Christmas, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure), Evie (Sofia Carson) daughter of the Evil Queen (Kathy Najimy),Carlos (Cameron Boyce) son of Cruella de Vil (Wendy Raquel Robinson), and Jay (Booboo Stewart) son of Jaffar (Maz Jobrani). Of course, there are multiple actors and actresses who also play crucial roles into the plot. From what I see, the Descendants film sends a healthy and positive (maybe even spiritual message) that it is possible for a person to create their own happy reality that is different from what may be expected of them depending on their parental andor family background. Obviously, this lesson could still be inclusive depending on whether what type of background a person came from. The children of the villains do adjust to life really well at Auradon Prep school and even enjoy themselves. This Descendants film is also good if you enjoy musical movies as there are song performances in the film.  I may be in the minority saying this, yet I do feel that the writers of the Ever After High Series and the Descendants films could maybe get together and collaborate (as there are creative parallels in a beneficial way with  some of the plot points while each of the series maintains its own originality). I also know for sure that I intend to eventually purchase both Disney Descendants films.",1452384000,2,2145,4.820652173913044

7161561,5,B00X797NJW,"At first, I was worried that it would be dark and have a negative effect on my childrens behavior. But upon reading up on this, I found out it is actually a good movie. The children of Disney's villians all chose to be upright citizens unlike their parents. The movie also makes the point that we should not judge others. My 8 year old daughter and 10 year old son loved it. The watched it several times and love singing along. My 12 year old son was not as interested.",1452384000,3,469,4.222222222222222

The song ""rotten to the core"" is my daughters favorite and she is always singing it. I wish they would have focused a bit more on the good.",1449014400,2,390,4.077922077922078

I wanted a simple role play game that was tailored for women, in other words, NOT a shoot 'em up, bang bang game - no war, no killing things, no stealing cars. Descendants was perfect! Easy to play. Collect coins, graduation caps, and shields by clicking bubbles, buy clothes, and then dressing up my avatar. (It was only after playing the game that I rented the movie to find out about Descendants.)

 This is a game without stress and violence. It is one that I can relax with after work. This is the perfect game to indulge my inner female child!",1449014400,,656,4.198412698412699

7161648,4,B00X797NJW,"I love this movie. I watched it on Disney Channel when it premiered and had to own it on dvd.  Price was right and I had trouble finding it in stores, especially for such a good price.  The slip case is really nice and 3d.  It even came with a free bracelet that I really like.  Its an original story with interesting characters and some good songs. And of course anything the director Kenny Ortega (High School Musical, Newsies, Hocus Pocus) does is amazing and wonderfully done. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the extras. There's actually a pretty good amount but there's so much more they have shown on disney channel like the half hour behind the scenes special ""set it off"" and a few other things that aren't included.  I mean, you produce and show all these extras but don't release them with the dvd?  And also there's no blu-ray available.  But I do like it the package and the movie itself.",1448668800,2,924,4.4

I like Descendants because it has a lot of action in it like the song ""Rotten To The Core"".  In he beginning, it has these ridiculous dance moves and there is so much going on when Mal gets to Auradon and they do the love spell. When Ben tells Mal that he has none and that he knew that he was under a spell since the Enchanted Lake washed it away. If you are wondering if you should watch Descendants, I would recommend it no matter what other people say. It is the best movie ever. If you you do watch this movie, then get Mal's Spell Book.",1448496000,,569,4.080357142857143

Good message, some decent songs (not enough songs to feel like a ""musical"", but the songs were a nice break from the movie and supported the plot well/helped develop the characters).  Genuinely enjoyable for adults, and well-suited for kids (I'd guess ages 7 and up--there are a few parts that could be mildly frightening for the youngin's).",1448064000,,512,4.930232558139535

7161789,3,B00X797NJW,"Entertaining, original, and fun concept that crashes and burns at the end.  About halfway through,  the off-kilter movie you have been watching is replaced with sterile dreck.  It is like two different writers were employed,  one with considerable imagination was assigned to the first half,  and one totally lacking in originality to the second - then the two halves were taped together with little effort to sand down the incongruities.

It still works quite effectively as a Dove Cameron promotional vehicle.  She absolutely glows on the screen,  your eyes are drawn to her in any wide group shot.  Her kinky look (for Disney purple hair & gothish outfits are kinky) agrees with her and amps up her hotness, as does her character's ""disdainful youth"" thing.  Of course it doesn't hurt that none of the other actresses are remotely as beautiful;  I doubt that this was an accident.  The production begins its downward slide the first time Cameron puts on a conventional outfit.

Melanie Paxson's Fairy Godmother was hilarious even as the film was falling apart around her.  She seems to be channeling Daniella Monet's Trina Vega persona,  think Trina auditioning to play an older character in a Hollywood Arts production.

They could have really had something special here,  but at least the first half is well worth your time.  And it nicely reveals that Cameron is no light weight and should be seeking out bad girl roles and overplayed original stuff like her ""Froyo"" music video.  Her talents are wasted on much of the sterile stuff Disney has thrown her way.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1445731200,,1613,4.878228782287823

7161836,5,B00X797NJW,"Our kids love this movie, we've watched the DVD several times and I'm sure we'll watch it several more. The thing I like about ""Disney's Descendants"" is that it reminds me so much of the fantasy musicals our family loved from the past, films like ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". It's probably more like the 2003 musical ""Wicked"" or 1978's ""The Wiz"" than the original ""The Wizard of Oz"" with Judy Garland, because it's a new twist on a classic, but what I personally like about it is what that it's ""not"" trying to be the dark and serious or type of fairy tale movie that's become so common lately.

It's old fashioned Walt Disney fun with some pretty cool modern music. It's maybe a little goofier than it needs to be in some places, but this made for TV movie's special effects are pretty impressive, the sets and costumes are great, and the young cast are so smart and talented, acting, singing, and dancing like pros, that I enjoy seeing ""Descendant"" more and more each times the kids want to see it again. Our family hopes there will be a sequel or two if this what we can look forward too, the kind of Fantasy-Musical-Comedy that the Walt Disney Co. was built on",1444780800,,1195,4.481651376146789

7161877,1,B00X797NJW,"Having seen the ads for this and having our 9yo daughter asking so nicely to see this we got it.  As a Disney movie goes it is barely acceptable.  When compared to Maleficent this doesn't even qualify as a joke.  The parents were hollow ghosts of the original movie.  There were a few songs of quality.

The evil queen is a plastic faced (to much plastic surgery is implied) whining figurine.  There is nothing to fear in her.  There is nothing of power.  A joke.  Aladdin is an old man with nothing to like.  Cruella De Vil is another pale ghost of the original character, there is nothing scary about her.  She presents as a dirty street person.  Maleficent has no touch of regal at all.  Nothing to fear nothing scary, nothing worthy of notice.  Add to that is silly song and dance routine and there is nothing there.

The heroes are barely palatable as down trodden angst driven teenagers.  A few good song and dances but character wise you could replace them with any Disney after school character and never notice the difference.  A plot line that is weaker still.

Save your money",1444176000,2,1087,4.515463917525773

Wow - and not in a good way. The dancing and music was fun and this is a very visually exciting movie. However, it is sexually suggestive (repeatedly and for the targeted age-group, inappropriately), far too focused on physical appearance (female), and gender-stereotypical.

This movie is predictable but fun. It is a teen movie with a few adults in a high school setting. Violence is minimal but the theme is 'good vs evil.' The main kids are the 'evil' kids because their parents are evil.

There is a lot of music and singing almost to the point of being too much. The music is kinda soft Disney stuff except for the stadium number (which is the best).

I am a 51 year-old man and enjoyed the movie. It was fun and sends a good overall message. Three stars from me is a good rating for this type of movie.",1441929600,3,774,4.216216216216216

Unlike previous Disney movies, Descendants opens up with a story from a tablet instead of a book. When Belle and Beast married they rounded up all of the villains and cast them away on an island with no Wifi and no escape. That is until Belle and Beast's son, Ben, is crowned king of Auradon and gives the offspring of the most notorious villains a chance to live a normal life in his kingdom. Their parents Evil Queen (Snow White), Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty), Jafar (Aladdin), and Cruella De Vil (101 Dalmations) eagerly await their kids efforts to reclaim the fairy godmother's wand to undo the protection magic on the Isle of the Lost.

Getting their hands on the wand is no easy task since it is locked down in a museum. The misfits will have to make friends at the boarding school and become acquainted with the offspring of Dopey, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Mulan, and the fairy godmother. Sadly many of the friendships are one side... Read more",1441929600,,1010,4.668539325842697

The characters and the story line are so cheesy I weep, but works to entertain and bring forth the message that kids can choose to be different than what their parents expect them to be.

The movie is about the children of the Disney movie villains who have been cast away into an island with their parents. The future boy king of neighboring kingdom Auradon wants to have those children come to the mainland and get a second chance since they shouldn't be held accountable for their parent's wrongdoing. Enter Mal, the daughter of Maleficent and leader of the de facto evil Brat Pack, who ends up with the Boy King, of course.

It's like high school musical for villains with it's catchy musical numbers and cute love story thrown in the mix . I love that it's not your typical disney movie where the princess gets the prince .. The only thing I didn't care for was that it didn't have enough of the other disney couples kids in it . It had the most common ones like sleeping beauty's daughter , cinderellas son , Milan daughter etc . I would have liked to seen some more like jasmines kid or repunzels and even Snow Whites .

7162061,4,B00X797NJW,"Great story concept. The movie is based on a book so, while not original, the movie's story is very creative. The songs are sung with enthusiasm and express the fun side of the characters. The actors playing the evil descendants are very talented and play their parts well. The movie is geared for tweens but is enjoyable for all ages. There are no scary scenes, little pda, and no bad language.
The downside is the casting for the adults. With the exception of Maleficent and the Evil Queen, the casting of the parents is an epic fail. Jafar is reduced to Gazeem, Aurora is apparently adopted because her mother is now a different race, the Beast is a complete nerd. For having done such a great job with the descendants, the casting at Disney really dropped the ball when it came to the parents. They get partial redemption for the Queens of evil. Those two women rocked their roles.
There is also a syncing issue with the instant video I purchased. The songs do not match up with the actors lip... Read more",1441756800,,1010,4.524590163934426

7162108,1,B00X797NJW,"Do not make the mistake of relegating the artistic merits of this movie to those of just ""family movies"" or ""kids films"". It is a movie. Hold it to the very same standards as you would for any movie at all. Especially for something you would show your kids.

I love Disney. It is a fantastic, successful company that makes quality products in nearly every area it has a market in. But any creative executives at the firm should be relatively ashamed to have their name on this.

The worst crime that the movie committed is the main character, and the message. The main character is Mal, the daughter of Maleficent. (Maleficent is extremely out of character in the movie, by the way. And isn't even green.) At the beginning of the film through the second act, she is actually a fairly likeable, respectable character that I enjoyed from an objective critical standpoint. In the prince/princess prep school environment of prissiness and good behavior, Mal is not intrepid to openly express her more rebellious attitude, alternative style, and her artistic side. This is extremely unique, defiant, likeable and admirable in a character in this type of an environment. Especially for kids. The movie stresses that it's message is to be yourself and never shy away from who you are. But in the third act, the Mal character abandons her entire personality and even dons a pretty-princess dress--completely assimilating into the adverse, even villainized, boring, well-behaved, prim-and-proper culture of the other students at the school. So sure, kids! Be yourself! But only if you wise up and be like everyone else in the end. That's the only way you'll find true love and be accepted by society. That is a hypocritical, garbage message, and a wasted opportunity to do something original with a unique main character. But it doesn't stop there.

Another character, Carlos, is the son of Cruella DeVile. He has a strange, irrational fear of dogs for some reason that serves no purpose to the plot. (Cruella DeVile hated dogs, she wasn't afraid of them. It doesn't make any sense that her son would fear dogs. It's just a poor excuse to try and be cute. There is no negative sentiment about dogs amongst society. We do not need to be shown that dogs are okay.)  Carlos is depicted as being poor at sports. When he does not do well on his try-outs for lacrosse, the coach says something to the effect of ""You ever think about band?"" in a very diminutive, mean-spirited fashion. This is insulting on so many levels. First of all, what this is telling your kids, (if you are dumb enough to show this rotten movie to them), is that sports are to be valued more than music, and that if you don't have athletic talent, you should feel bad. Hurtful, untrue, and insulting to people and kids who love music. I was in band in highschool. We were the biggest group/club/team in the whole school! Besides, if you're telling kids that music is for losers, than who's going to make all of that music that you like putting in your high-school-wannabe-teen tv movies, hm?

That's the next offense. The music. When Disney churned out High School Musical, they knew very quickly that they struck gold. HSM is original, enjoyable, and artistic compared to Descendants. It is insultingly obvious that the movie is trying to use the same pop song with dance choreography in a high school setting AGAIN in an attempt to bolster kids attention and the films success. Even worse, they blatantly rip off entirely accapella vocals and pop song and dance choreography in a high school setting for an entire number. (Glee, anyone!) The worst of the bunch is a mutilated, bastardized, hip-hop version of Be Our Guest from Beauty and the Beast. It's not cute. It's not fun. It's not creative. It comes off as disingenuous, half-assed, and phoned in.

The film also has a lot of logical fallacies, plot holes, insulting stereotypes, and even things that contradict Disney's own history! The ethnicities of some of the characters is was a big issue for me. Now, I am ALL for ethnic diversity, especially in a kids film. But you HAVE to do it in a way that makes sense. Kids aren't dumb. They may not vocalize it all the time, but they notice when something doesn't add up. Why is Cruella DeVille African American? Kids have seen 101  dalmations! They know she's a white, French woman. You even kept her white in the live action movie! Why change it now? Just poor casting? No. It's the films illogical way of trying to racially diversify a movie that is whiter than a snowstorm in a way that goes against Kid-known Disney history. Why didn't they just choose an African American main character, or supporting character? Also, the character Jay, the son of Jafar, (Saudi Arabian), doesn't look Middle Eastern in the least. At all. Furthermore, Jafar is depicted as an Epcot Arabia, stereotypical, morrocan/sikh/caricature. Why didn't they keep the costume from Aladdin? They didn't even TRY to recreate it! The worst part, though, is Mulan's daughter. Oh my god, they way they show her initially is like a klansman from Kentucky's idea of what a Chinese woman would look like. But get this! She only finds herself pretty when she has Mal magically change her hair to a wavy, longer, European hairstyle. What a great lesson for kids! ""White aesthetics are the only pretty ones!"" ""You only look good if you look like you're from a french fairy tale! Abandon your culture, traditions, and heritages!"". There's also just a bunch of things that don't make sense, or are just in bad taste. There are literally infant mortality jokes in a classroom setting in the middle of the movie. Yeah. Sure. Show your kids that.

I don't know, folks... It may sound like I'm nitpicking, but I'm really not. Every film has flaws, but in a good film, you don't notice those flaws the first time you watch it. These were blaring, obvious, nasty, mean-spirited, illogical, and unoriginal. There ARE good films for kids that are just good films over all. Films like Secret Of Nimh, Spirited Away, Song Of The Sea, and a bunch of other movies for kids literally do hold up even until adulthood as masterful pieces of cinema. Don't just settle for what's popular, or what you think will sedate your kids for a while. You could be harming their worldview, mentalities, or worst of all, their creativity by showing them this awful, uninspired, hypocritical wank of a movie, and contemporaries thereof.

P.S. The biggest injustice this movie commits is insulting the title of the wonderful George Cloony movie of the same name about family landownership, and geographic torist development in hawaii.",1441497600,14,6632,4.7952755905511815

The song at the end is phenomenal and did I mention is too. Rotten to the core is the best though.

I thought the movie overall was better with the kids after they got settled in and there was some decent acting. It's a fun movie to watch but inside out and tomorrowland and the new movie underdog are the things you should really invest your time on. Even zapped but definitely not bad hair day.

7162244,4,B00X797NJW,"Great story concept. The movie is based on a book so, while not original, the movie's story is very creative.  The songs are sung with enthusiasm and express the fun side of the characters.  The actors playing the evil descendants are very talented and play their parts well. The movie is geared for tweens but is enjoyable for all ages.  There are no scary scenes, little pda, and no bad language.
The downside is the casting for the adults. With the exception of Maleficent and the Evil Queen, the casting of the parents is an epic fail. Jafar is reduced to Gazeem, Aurora is apparently adopted  because her mother is now a different race, the Beast is a complete nerd. For having done such a great job with the descendants,  the casting at Disney really dropped the ball when it came to the parents. They get partial redemption for the Queens of evil.  Those two women rocked their roles.
There is also a syncing issue with the instant video I purchased.  The songs do not match up with the actors lip movement. It is especially obvious at the scene near the enchanted lake. The dvd or HD version may not have this issue.",1440288000,,1124,4.5073891625615765
7162245,5,B00X797NJW,Great spin on the lives of the children of the Princes and Princesses as well as the Villains!!! The ending was kind of open so definitely hoping for another Descendants!!! My 6 year old loved this movie!!!,1440288000,,206,4.594594594594595
7162246,4,B00X797NJW,"Thank you Disney for sending us this movie to review!

Unlike previous Disney movies, Descendants opens up with a story from a tablet instead of a book.  When Belle and Beast married they rounded up all of the villains and cast them away on an island with no Wifi and no escape.  That is until Belle and Beast's son, Ben, is crowned king of Auradon and gives the offspring of the most notorious villains a chance to live a normal life in his kingdom.  Their parents Evil Queen (Snow White), Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty), Jafar (Aladdin), and Cruella De Vil (101 Dalmations) eagerly await their kids efforts to reclaim the fairy godmother's wand to undo the protection magic on the Isle of the Lost.

Getting their hands on the wand is no easy task since it is locked down in a museum.  The misfits will have to make friends at the boarding school and become acquainted with the offspring of Dopey, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Mulan, and the fairy godmother.  Sadly many of the friendships are one sided as the descendants are using their social engineering skills and magic to get what they want.

They're not all bad once they step away from their parent's shadows though.  I like how this movie teaches about forgiveness and redemption.  Each of the descendants learns to accomplish things on their own and they become well aware of good and evil and its consequences.  Some of the treatment the descendants get is well deserved, but not all of it is.

Without spoiling the story I'll refrain from going into more detail.  I do however, highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys Disney's animated classics.  The characters are well developed and the songs (though obviously lip synched) and costumes are vibrant and well done.  I enjoyed the rap remake of Be Our Guest.  All three of my kids liked this film and  I'm sure other families will enjoy it as well.",1440288000,2,1869,4.701538461538462
7162247,5,B00X797NJW,"All I've got to say is that this movie was sooo good! Okay so this was my second time watching this movie. Once before I read the book and the second time after I read the book. The book was a prologue to the movie and this movie sort of starts right where the book ended. Granted I said sort of because we have to go through Mal talking and bringing us into with what was going through in Auradon if we haven't read the book.

Sure some people say that this movie sucks but to someone that has watched the old Disney and some of the new Disney that this movie is really good. I love all the songs that was in the movie along with the acting. I love the way that they changed ethnicity of some of the characters in the movie so that it works well with the kids nowadays.

I don't know for about some other people but I always wondered what happened after each happily ever after that happened in the movies. Now with this movie I can squash that wondering since I have it. I love all of the characters in the movies because they are all different.

The thing that I love is the way that the book tied in even more with the movie. Prince Ben and Mal both have visions of the other in both different locations than of where they were. Mal had a vision of her and Bens first date in Auradon and Ben had a vision of Mal helping him up in Isle of the Lost. I also like how Mal, Evie, Jay and Carloss kind of friendship transferred into the movie.

If anyone asked me about this movie I will say that it is a five butterflies and that they should really watch this movie after they read the book!",1440201600,5,1590,4.054140127388535

Having Kenny Ortega direct and choreograph the movie was icing on the cake; everything he touches seems to turn to gold. I like the message that we are not defined by the actions of our parents; we make our own choices and define ourselves by those choices.

One of the big pros is that although it had a lessen for young kids, it wasn't over the top cheesy. Again, it is Disney, but I was impressed.
Cons are that Mal did most of the important singing - I know she's more the main character, but I wanted to hear about the others too.

I was surprised at how poor a job the writers and casting directors did at achieving any sort of continuity (however temporary or whimsical it was intended to be) with the original Disney movies.  None of the established characters in this movie (like Belle, the Beast, the Evil Queen, etc.) had anything in common with the well-known characters they were supposed to represent besides some vague costuming similarities, and so I was stuck wondering how it was that I, who had seen these movies 20 years ago, seemed to know more about them than the makers of this film.

7162374,5,B00X797NJW,"Honestly I think I liked this movie more than my kids. Granted my boys are 7 and 8 and don't really care about fairy tales and my daughter is only 4, I really liked the characters and story. It is such a cute story featuring four villains whose kids were chosen by Beauty and the Beast's son, the prince, to come to high school with all the good kids. The villains live on their own island and you can imagine what it looks like with all the villains and troublemakers living there, especially compared to where all the goody-goody people live. The villain teenagers don't want to go but their overbearing parents of course want them to go and steal something that would allow them to take over. Will the teenagers make their parents proud and be bad or will they make their own decisions? It is such a great story for today's kids of how kids can make their own decisions rather than following in their parent's footsteps. I've known friends who were miserable because they did what their parents wanted them to do/be rather than hurt their feelings and say they don't want to. My own kids have done that and I've had to explain it is okay to be different. For example, my husband is huge into hockey and got our boys into it. They played it but I could tell my middle child just didn't want to do it but was doing it because his dad wanted him to.

Great family movie and one we have watched a few times now. I love the songs they sing randomly and little dances, very upbeat and entertaining. Yes the characters do break out in singing and dancing occasionally throughout the movie. It is funny too to see how Disney portrays the fairytale kids in general with teenagers from lots of the fairy tale favorites such as Aurora, Cinderella, Fairy Godmother and more.

I received this movie to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1439424000,8,1841,4.459940652818991

Really, Mouse Company, is THIS the best you can come up with?  Like the endless sequels and spin-offs aren't tedious and done-to-death enough as it is?  Now you have to do spin-offs based on...the OFFSPRING of the villains of the classic movies??  And some genius (no doubt at the corporate level who never had a single original thought in his life, probably) honestly thought THIS was such a brilliant, inspired idea?!?  Sheesh!  It reminds me of the kind of retarded, cheesy trash that Hanna-Barbera and Filmation used to crank out for Saturday Morning television, back in the cheesy, trashy 70s!!  (Geez, and I thought the endless stream of stupid ""Buddies"" movies they keep endlessly cranking out were lame!)

7162438,2,B00X797NJW,"When I first heard about this movie, I had no expectations (haven't had any for a Disney Channel Movie since the disappointment that was Halloweentown High and then the travesty that was Return to Halloweentown). It peaked my interest slightly when I read Kathy Najimy was playing the Evil Queen but then lowered when I read Kristin Chenoweth was playing Maleficent (good actress/singer but not the person who I imagine playing someone who's the worst of the worst). I also figured how this movie would play out when I saw the basic plot and it ended how I expected (though I wasn't expecting the High School Musical finale rip-off). Wanting my pain to end, I watched the movie on the Watch Disney Channel app the night before the premiere and... boy was I right! I had nothing good to say about this movie; everything was wrong from casting to the fact that it was a musical.

First the songs. These were some of the most insipid, lazily written songs for a Disney film featuring classic Disney characters. With the exception of Rotten to the Core and Evil Like Me, they all sound like rejects/leftovers from High School Musical. Evil Like Me, while not great, is probably the best of the bunch since it sounds like a classic Disney song. Which is more than I can say for the one classic that is in the film which sounds terrible! Excluding the aforementioned song, they all sound the same and all the actors are auto-tuned like crazy.

Now the teen (early twenties) actors. The heroes I was fine with, they played their bland, stereotypical high school roles. But the villains' kids were the disappointment except Booboo Stewart as Jay.  These are the kids of Disney's vilest villains? Is this a joke? I never bought these kids as evil, they all came across as nice, particularly Dove Cameron as Mal. She pouted her lip for a good chunk of the time but I never believed that she was the daughter of Disney's most powerful villain. Her acts of evil border on the misdemeanor (especially the clichd ""stealing candy from a baby"" schtick). I know they're teenagers but since they're supposed to be the offspring of Disney's worst (you know, like cursing a baby to die because you weren't invited to her christening, wanting a young girls' heart ripped out because she's prettier than you, stealing and wanting to kill 99 puppies to make a coat, and hypnotizing the ruler of a nation while making his daughter your personal slave), I expect more than messing up someone's hair.

Which brings me to my next point: the parents. Good God Disney Channel, what did you do? There is no way these characters are the same ones who were capable of the crimes I listed above. The Evil Queen and Maleficent were cold and calculating, Cruella de Vil and Jafar were psychotics. Here we have Kathy Najimy with her face pulled back (but at least her vanity remained), Jafar is a junk salesman for no reason and Cruella seems like a drugged out loon and didn't even resemble her own character (keep in mind I'm not talking about Wendy Raquel Robinson herself but the fact that she doesn't have the black and white hair or her big fur coat while Kathy Najimy's Evil Queen retains her original costume and Maz Jobrani's Jafar at least had a red turban). But it's Kristin Chenoweth's Maleficent who barely resembles her former self. No longer the demanding presence she was in Sleeping Beauty, Once Upon A Time or her own crappy film, here she's more reminiscent of Bette Midler's Winifred Sanderson or MMPR's Rita Repulsa; over the top and chewing the scenery. The scene in the Hall of Villains (where at least the four resemble their past selves) is where I face palmed when the Mistress of All Evil starts singing and dancing. Now I'm a fan of villain songs; I love Poor Unfortunate Souls, Be Prepared, Hellfire, Friends on the Other Side and Mother Knows Best and I know the only reason she gets a song is because they realized ""Hey, we got Kristin Chenoweth, let's give her a song!"" but Maleficent, along with the Evil Queen and Cruella, are villains who don't need to sing a song to convey how evil they are, they just do what they do. In fact the song would've been better suited for Ursula or Mother Gothel, who are overly dramatic, give sass, and crack jokes as they sing. But I'll admit they did get a few things right by having Maleficent be evil (a sillier, non-threatening evil), teleport about AND turn into a dragon (more than that crappy live action film did anyway)

There is one scene I do like. It's small and I'm probably putting too much into this but I liked it. When Queen Leah (Aurora's mother) berates Mal for what her mother did to her daughter and how she felt, knowing she missed her child growing up. It made me notice that there was something sadly missing from this movie: actual conflict. It was actually great to see someone challenging the Prince's proclamation on allowing the villains' kids into the kingdom. Of course this leads to the oh-so-obvious moral at the end but it's something I wish there was more of. Not the snide little comments between Mal and Audrey or trying to put Prince Ben under a love spell, but repercussions for how the villains affected the lives of the people they hurt. Granted I don't know how'd they do that with Cruella since her story didn't deal with royals or anything but whatever, just a small scene that was more powerful than Mal singing and flailing her arms about while scenes we just saw fifteen seconds ago flash across the screen.

Somewhere there was a good movie trying to come out. If there were different actors or no songs, this would've had something going for it. Not asking for a gripping character study on the psychology of villains but just something that doesn't insult the legacy of these characters. I'm hoping there won't be a sequel but judging from that ending, there probably will.",1438905600,5,5855,4.6412729026036645

7162447,1,B00X797NJW,"This new Disney trend of turning old classics into live action movies get a new twist.  I grew up on Disney classics.  Then when they started combining different fairy tales, turning villains into heroes which in turn making heroes into bad guys that really ticked me off.  No longer is good good and no longer is bad bad.  I wonder how parents can bring up their kids and instill them with good values and morals  these days.  I hope it is just in the U. S. but I fear the worst.  The plot of this is so typical and boring; it is definitely not for anyone who has seen the real world outside of this made believe Disney fantasy.  Of course kids will love it.  As movies these days point out, kids know better than kids and parents have a lot to learn from kids.  Please....",1438732800,6,774,4.239726027397261

7162449,5,B00X797NJW,"So I read a review talking about how this is a bad movie so I just want to clarify. The love story is not the main story, when I read that in another review I was disappointed at Disney. The main story is the struggle between good and bad, just like 90% of Disney movies. Sure, the other characters don't get as much screen time as Mal, but they did have back stories and a few meaningful scenes. I did hate how the 'good' kids were so shallow but it's actually realistic because when you're born into luxury you feel entitled so I actually really liked this movie. The music is also pretty cool they all have good voices.",1438646400,31,622,4.235294117647059
7162450,2,B00X797NJW,"Disney could have had a very interesting, creative idea here, but it seems very watered-down and boring. The story is fairly cliche, with everything winding up exactly as one would predict and very little originality when it comes to the character arcs or how the writers chose to treat the characters. The villains are evil. Just... evil. Nothing showing that they have any redeemable qualities or showing any reasons why they did what they did or how they justify it. They're just mean.  I feel as though Disney could have created an interesting movie showing about how people can't be simply divided into good and evil and showing the whole, ""History is written by the victors"" thing, which could have been an interesting lesson for kids. Instead, we get tendrils of a good movie wrapped up in a whole lot of generic plot lines and stock characters.

It isn't completely horrible. The actors are all decent, the costuming is very cool, and the choreography and music, while a bit forced at times (Like it wasn't meant to be a musical), is well done. This movie was just bogged down by its negative aspects and is, overall, disappointing.",1438646400,5,1140,4.781725888324873

As a young adult (22), I was definitely skeptical about the movie going into it, as it seems geared more toward a younger crowd. While the dancing was a bit over the top sometimes, it had a nice message about being able to make your own choices and a cute plot that reminded me a bit of High School Musical or Sky High. It wasn't the best movie I have seen all year, but it was cute and it was worth the purchase.

Also, the included bracelet was a nice touch and my niece is sure to love it. I bought a second copy that will be going to her mom for her.",1438560000,38,673,3.8768115942028984

My only complaint is that for a Disney Channel Movie made for kids, there is too much sexuality in it. Meaning, girls in short skirts flirting with boys to get their way and dance routines by Kenny Ortega that at times are too ""sexy"" for the intended ""G"" audience, in my opinion. Not at all necessary to include stuff like that in rated ""G"" kids movies.",1438560000,10,550,4.19811320754717

7162457,2,B00X797NJW,"Ive been hearing for months about the new Disney Channel movie Descendants.  I thought it sounded like a lot of fun, and Ive was really looking forward to its premier last Friday night.  Wow, was it disappointing.

The movie tells the story of Mal (Dove Cameron), Carlos (Cameron Boyce), Jay (Booboo Stewart), and Evie (Sofia Carson), the kids of Maleficent (Kristin Chenoweth), Cruella de Vil (Wendy Raquel Robinson), Jafar (Maz Jobrani), and Evil Queen (Kathy Najimy) respectively.  Because their parents have been banished to the Isle of the Lost, theyve grown up there and never seen the rest of the kingdom.

However, Prince Ben (Mitchell Hope) is about to take the throne of the united kingdom of Auradon, and he wants to give these kids of villains a chance to prove they can be good.  Hes selected these four as the first batch to come and go to school, sometimes with the kids of the very people their own parents tried to harm.

But Maleficent has a plan of her own.  If these four kids can just get the Fairy Godmothers (Malanie Paxson) wand, then their parents can escape the island and get their ultimate revenge.  Will the kids be able to get the wand?

Now lets dispel the idea that I was upset by this film being predictable.  Yes, it went where I expected it to go, but that was fine.  I don't mind predictable  if I am enjoying the film.  It was the rest that went wrong.

For one thing, there are too many characters.  I mean, look at the list of characters I mentioned above, and thats just the start.  Each of the descendants have their own sub-plot of character growth, but they aren't developed enough for us to care.  The only one that comes close is Mal, and thats because she is really our main character.  They should have axed the other three and just really focused on her.  As it is, I never got to know the characters enough to care about the outcome.

Then theres the acting.  Mitchell Hope, Dove Cameron, and Kristin Chenoweth were all fine, but the rest of the cast hammed it up.  This is especially true of the adult villains, who didn't feel like the villains we already love to hate at all.  Now, if you check out my reviews, youll quickly see that I can get into cheesy and corny acting and really enjoy it.  Here, it was just painful.

Once Kenny Ortega of High School Musical and Newsies fame was attached to direct, this movie turned into a musical.  The songs weren't bad, but they didn't really add much to the film.  If that screen time had been spent on character development, the movie would have been better.

Really, it just comes down to character development.  We don't know the characters enough to care about the outcome we know is coming, so we are bored waiting for the film to get there.

I had such high hopes for Descendant, but the film just couldn't meet them.  I won't be wasting my time on it again in the future.",1438473600,9,2874,4.467307692307692

7162464,2,B00X797NJW,"*THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS*

First off, before I get into the review, this film is a sequel to Melissa De La Cruz's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Isle-of-the-Lost-A-Descendants-Novel-The-Descendants/dp/1484720970/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Isle of the Lost: A Descendants Novel (The Descendants)</a>, a story about four children, Mal, Evie, Carlos, and Jay, who are the offspring of Disney's greatest villains--Malificent, The Evil Queen, Cruella, and Jafar. Without spoiling too much the plot revolves around them questioning their parents moral decisions and whether or not they should follow in their footsteps. I haven't read the book but when I heard about it (and the film) my heart was pumping in anticipation.

...I really, really wanted to like this movie. As a longtime Disney nerd there was so much wasted potential here. The story more or less is the standard DCOM fare. Now I am a sucker for this and if done right the film could be great, but sadly the story ultimately fell flat for a variety of reasons, the first being the pacing. Unfortunately most of the screentime was focused on Mal. While not necessarily a bad thing, Evie, Jay, and Carlos are kind of just there and lacked substance. They all get their little 'moment' to prove they play some part but ultimately it felt forced trying to cram all these subplots into such a short amount of time. Development for those three as characters was thrown under the bus. We don't know enough about them to care. Had Mal been the only main character I believe the overall story wouldn't have felt so rushed, which leads me into my next point: the love-story aspect between Mal and another character (I won't spoil it). This was a totally unnecessary subplot for the movie; the villains' development as people from evil to good is far more than enough. As cute as the couple looks this plot was just very poorly executed. It didn't help that the two leading actors had zero chemistry together. Ultimately this wasted screentime that could have been spent elsewhere.

Character execution for the overall cast was very weakly handled. The other characters include Ben (Belle's son), Audrey (Sleeping Beauty's daughter), Chad (Cinderella's son), with Lonnie (Mulan's daughter), Doug (Dopey's son--a totally random and completely unnecessary character), and Jane (Fairy Godmother's daughter) popping in every now and them. Excluding Ben, who is courageous and kind and gives the villains a chance to redeem themselves in the first place, what surprised me was how shallow the rest of these characters were. As the offspring of their benevolent parents you would think they'd be good-natured and fair! Chad flirts with Evie just so she'd do his homework for him and then ditches her to be with another girl. Audrey was the typical popular beauty queen who had Ben wrapped around her little bratty finger, wining and complaining about everything Ben said or did, dying to be the center of attention among her peers and showing no remorse when belittling others to do so. And at the end of the film one of these characters performs this totally random 'out-of-the-blue' twist that is very unlike them, making me believe Disney just randomly threw it in hoping to achieve a 'wow' factor. And the villains' parents themselves? Malificent, Jafar, Cruella and The Evil Queen were presented as bumbling idiots, totally out of character from their malicious animated film counterparts. I was not impressed.

Production values were solid overall. The music and costumes were decent, as was the acting. Kristin Chenoweth killed it as Malificent and up-and-coming Disney star Dove Cameron and Mitchell Hope stole the show as Mal and Ben. Cameron and Booboo seemed to be enjoying themselves as the eccentric Carlos and Jay respectively and Sofia Carson looked stunning as Evie. Directed and choreographed by the famous Kenny Ortega (High School Musical), the film features a plethora of well-versed song-and-dance numbers. Ortega's strength is creating these dance numbers and it clearly shows here. The songs themselves were just 'okay' to horribly cringe worthy, especially the first song ""Rotten to the Core,"" and ""Be Our Guest,"" a modern remix of Howard Ashman/Alan Menken's song written for the 1991 animated version of Beauty and the Beast. If Ashman were alive he would be ashamed at this horrendous butchering of his work. Disney ripped apart a classic song and turned it into goodness knows what. The kids of this generation will love it but as an old-timer I felt it was an insult to their legacy. Otherwise, ""If Only"" was a nice little ballad and ""Set it Off"" was a strong finisher in wrapping up the film's core values--we are not who are parents--or others for that matter--define us. I had high hopes for the music overall coming from the acclaimed Ortega but these songs weren't doing it for me. The music is not one of his better efforts and in my opinion it marks one of his weakest score to date.

Despite all my complaints, the movie still carries good messages for children and is certainly age appropriate for young audiences. All in all Descendants had the potential to be phenomenal had certain plot-lines been executed differently, had there been better music, had there been more screen time for other characters, and had there been changes to the overall story. I'd definitely recommend the film for small children--they will love it--but adult audiences looking for more will not be satisfied. 2.8/5",1438300800,6,5545,5.136212624584718
