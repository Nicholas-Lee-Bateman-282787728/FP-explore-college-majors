2417046,5,B000BGR0MO,"Mugen, Jin, and Fuu are about to complete the last leg of their quest to find the ""samurai who smells of sunflowers"" on the backwater island of Ikitsuki Island. Of course, in Samurai Champloo, nothing is as easy as it sounds. The Shogunate has dispatched its most lethal assassin to kill all three of them before they meet up with Fuu's father. If they manage to survive the encounter with him, they also have to deal with a trio of brothers, one with a deadly chain link scythe, the other a deformed toad of a maniac, and the last a wheel-chair bound vegetable. The other question is whether Mugen, Fuu, and Jin even WANT to end their journeys together?

This is a nice wrap-up for this boundary pushing anime. I was not a big fan of the show based on watching the first volume, but I'm glad I stuck around for the rest of its run. Watanabe-san wanted it to be unconventional in the sense that the characters in the show do not change, as is the norm for most literary forms. It works. While the characters do not change, they do become wiser about what it is that they are missing in their lives. The production values in terms of animation in Volume 7 are simply stunning, and that's a good thing because these last three episodes are pretty much wall-to-wall fighting. The Japanese voice acting is excellent as usual and the English is pretty good too. I thought the ending could have been done a little better but it wasn't that big of a deal.

Extras are pretty skimpy: A BRIEF trailer for the Samurai Champloo videogame, Conceptual art, and some stills of the ""bumpers"" (the stills used when the show went to and back between commercial breaks).",1142208000,,1652,4.503333333333333
2417047,5,B000BGR0MO,"This is the best ending to a anime I have seen.  You're not really sure what's going happen or even in some parts, what has happened.  I like like the fact that the last disk was a three part episode, almost like a movie.",1141689600,,221,4.0
2417048,5,B000BGR0MO,"Ok first off I love the show all of it every second im watching this show im in heaven. My favorite part u gussed it the action,fighting, all the things Bebop was famous for OH and the edgey edge of the show mixed with rap/hip-hop style is great. Now for the review of the final disc,#7 it is great the way the story progresses and the climax are done perfectly as well as the return to the back story you get all your ansers you want. Alas the only thing in the entire series i have issuses with is the last 2:00 min before the credits in the very very end of the last episode is that when they to a 3 road cross way they go diffrent directions and the credists role that bgurned me up i liked them being togeather though the whole series and now they split? But i still have to give it a 5 beacuse i love it so much. Must cheak it out now go buy 1-7 and watch them with delight.",1141084800,,880,3.949438202247191
2417049,5,B000BGR0MO,"The finale of this brilliant show surpasses all expectations by having an exciting nail-biting ending. Although there are only 3 episodes on this disc, the episodes form a long feature length ending. Our heroes finally arrive at their long-awaited destination only to find unwelcome people from their pasts waiting for them. The show clearly answers all the questions it has raised during previous episodes and ties up loose ends. We find out about Jin's past and why he killed his Sensei. We also find out the reason behind the motivations of previous assassins. Does Fuu find her ""samurai who smells of sunflowers?"" - well that would be telling. However, be prepared for an emotional ending as it is never certain who will survive as Jin and Mugen finally meet their match. A great ending to a great series.

Unfortunately there is at this time no second season - only the 26 episodes already released. The mention of a second series is due to the move from Fuji TV to Broadcast Satellite Fuji in Japan. The move caused a three month stop gap in the airing of the programme, so the official designation of the First Season  are episodes 1 to 17 and of the Second Season 18-26. This can be seen by the preview advertisement contained in the extras in the DVD Volume 5 for ""Season Two."" However, I am still praying that another second series will be made!",1138665600,4,1355,4.665271966527197
2417050,5,B000BGR0MO,"Samurai Champloo has become one of the greatest anime series ever with this final volume. It ranks well beside Cowboy Bebop, Watanabe's other masterpiece of anime, and in many ways surpasses it. Watanabe's series, though based in fuedal Japan, does not limit itself to those restrictions, instead taking a surrealistic view of history, which allows for both minor and huge discrepancies, and the larger the lie, the funnier the episode. Along with the comedy, the story centers around great action and even greater music.

But in this volume, drama dominates. All of the characters meet the conclusion of their own personal stories, while wrapping up their story as a group. Jin faces a man directly linked to his past as a swordsman; Mugen faces a family bent on revenge for Mugen's past life as a pirate; and Fuu finally meets the Sunflower Samurai. Though you may think I spoiled it, just watch and see, for none of these endings end exactly as you would expect.

Then, after all three of these linked episodes are finished, you are treated to a Reggae-style rap sung partly in English but mostly in Japanese. To me, this was the perfect ending theme to a series that relied heavily on its music.

So as not to spoil, I'll finish my review saying this. The end of Samurai Champloo is both exciting and a bit sad. It's a perfect conclusion to a perfect anime series, and sufficiently answers all the questions left behind in the previous volumes. If you have any anime sense, then you've already seen this anime and love it. If you don't, then hurry and get this so that you can say you were one of the first to see one of the best. This anime was definitely worth me collecting every separate volume, and I'd recommend the same for anyone else out there. Right now, I'm hoping Watanabe takes the same direction he did with Cowboy Bebop and makes the Samurai Champloo movie.",1138579200,8,1876,4.661631419939577
2417051,5,B000BGR0MO,"At long last, the seventh and final volume of Shinichiro Watanabe's follow-up to Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo is here.

It's been a long, exciting, and sometimes strange journey for Fuu, Jin, and Mugen -- and it all comes down to the climactic three-part finale. ""Evanescent Encounter"" is the culmination of everything the series has to offer.

The finale opens up with the three main characters having a surprisingly open and heart-felt chat by a fire. Secrets are revealed and some lingering questions are answered. This prelude really hits it home that the trip Watanabe-san has taken us on is coming to an end.

I don't want to divulge too much -- as there are plenty of shocks and surprises in this final volume -- but the action and drama in the last three epiosdes is arguably the best in the entire series. The final battles are animated so incredibly well and will keep many on the edge of their seats. And the lingering question of whether Fuu will finally meet the Sunflower Samurai is at last answered...

Shinichiro Watanabe has done an incredible job with Samurai Champloo. While it may not be the instant pop classic that Cowboy Bebop is, it is a great tale of three strangers setting out on a journey who come to discover a great bond and friendship. The last three episodes are everything the viewer has been waiting for and then some. I can honestly say, this is one of the best endings I've seen to any television series (animated or live-action).

So, what are you waiting for? Go pick up the final volume of Samurai Champloo now! You will not be disappointed.",1137715200,3,1582,4.676258992805756
2417052,5,B000BGR0MO,"I am writing my review on Volume 7, but it will reflect the whole series.

First off, let me say this series was great. The action in the series is a welcome change of pace. The way that it depicted the fueldal era of Japan was great. Overall, I'd give the series an 8.9 out of 10.

This series bears many similarities to the director's first work, Cowboy Bebop. Mugen resembles Spike in many ways. The bad a$$, the fluffy hair, the way he doesn't care but still knows what he's doing. The guy who will take on anyone win or lose. The one looking for a challenge. In a way, I think that Wantanabe will never get away from his best character, Spike.

I only went in depth into how Mugen resembles Spike, but to be honest with you, the series still has the same ""feel"", as Bebop did. Not as ground breaking though. What Bebop did was unreal, it put S.W. on the map. But, Champloo is like it in so many ways. The story is nice. The way it is more linear is good. It gives the series a goal. A sense of purpose. Also, the way the action scenes were put together was awesome as well, it's always nice to see a change in pace from gun fights to sword fights.

Another thing about Samurai Champloo is that you get a better sense of closure then in Cowboy Bebop. The way it ends leaves open to build upon the series. Maybe even a season two that follows Mugen of Jin more in depth, where as Fuu was the one who was the main driving force in this one.

I didn't like how it was spread across 7 DVDs though. I bought them all anyway but if you can do 6 DVDs for 26 episodes of Cowboy Bebop, why not 6 DVDs again for the same amount of episodes like Champloo??

The last 3 Episodes were very good. They get a 10 out of 10. Great action, great way to bring to story to a close.

All in all, the series was great, not as good as Cowboy Bebop, but still great. Many similarities to Cowboy Bebop, but let's be honest: Is that a bad thing considering how incredible Cowboy Bebop was??

All I can say is, can't wait to see what Wanatanabe does next. Space Cowboy Bounty Hunters with a somewhat western feel, Samurai masters set in Japan, what's next? Who knows...",1137196800,3,2146,4.141826923076923
2417053,5,B000BGR0MO,"Yes this is the finale and although we want to know the mystery of the Samurai that smells of Sunflowers we will still crave this great series. In this volume Mugen, Jin, and Fuu close in on Ikitsuki Island but conflict and these three are still close. Three brothers that have some problems with Mugen take Fuu hostage. She's finally freed and the trio eventually makes it to find what they've been fighting for. The final battles of samurai champloo do not disappoint. Mugin has a showdown with the last brother and he not only wants Mugins blood but he wants to kill his pride.",1136073600,2,580,4.533333333333333
2417054,5,B000BGR0MO,"Great story, great ending, everything comes together at the end, all questions will be ansewered. And the msot important thing is....you find out what happens to our heroes, it's a shame I had to see this great story come to an end.",1134086400,5,232,4.5476190476190474
8086637,5,B000BGR0MO,Finally we get back to the story. Fuu decides to make the rest of the journey on her own. The fellas meet a powerful man who just might be too much for them. The guy with the chain blade is a pain but just keep watching. It gets a little dramatic and fails at it but I've grown to like this volume. I hope anybody going through these DVDs had as much fun as I did so long ago. Buy the soundtracks. Whatever you can. Peace. ...Yeah it ends that way.,1473292800,,448,3.934065934065934

8086644,5,B000BGR0MO,"WOW! THAT'S ALL I CAN POSSIBLY THINK TO SAY ABOUT THIS DVD!

IT HAS SOME OF THE BEST FIGHT SCENES IN THE ENTIRE SERIES AND THE FIGHTS ARE ALSO SUPERBLY ANIMATED, EVEN BY SAMURAI CHAMPLOO STANDARDS. WOW! WITH EACH DVD THEY SOMEHOW MANAGED TO CROSS BOUNDARIES AND OUTDO THEIR PREVIOUS DVDS WITH EACH NEW ONE. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE LAST THREE EPISODES (TECHNICALLY ONE) OF SAMURAI CHAMPLOO. TO SUM IT UP FOR YOU, THE LAST EPISODE OF THE SERIES IS ON THE DVD, BUT IT IS SPLIT INTO THREE PARTS. THEY FINALLY END THEIR JOURNEY. I MUST SAY THOUGH, THE ENDING WAS SAD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE, SO I AM NOT COMPLAINING TOO MUCH. I RECCOMEND THIS WHOLE F****** DVD TEN STARS OUT OF TEN! BUT REALLY, I GIVE IT AN INFINITE!

BUY THIS!

Plus Mugen and Jin's final(for the time being) battle was great, leaving you starstruck and impressed by his ability to develope their relationship through battle.
