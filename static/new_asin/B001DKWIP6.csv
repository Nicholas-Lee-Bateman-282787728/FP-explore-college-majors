8607011,5,B001DKWIP6,"I have viewed over 50 educational videos similar to this one, and I have to say that Rendall's videos are by far the best I've seen.  Rendall has a charisma about him that makes him credible and easy to relate to.  I have watched almost all of David Rendall's videos and I haven't found one that I don't like.  His presentations are humorous, but very educational.  The tips he gives in this ""Recharge"" video are great.  I am a very busy, stressed person, and after watching this video, I have a different outlook on how I should manage my stress.  Rendall uses easy to follow methods to manage stress.  Overall, I'd have to say if you are looking for a good, motivational, educational video, this is the one to get-- you won't be disappointed.",1251072000,,744,4.507462686567164
