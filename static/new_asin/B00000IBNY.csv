A delight to watch, and also a good introduction to the Magic Flute for English speakers.",1355875200,,189,4.7272727272727275
7909640,5,B00000IBNY,"If I had so categorize my familiarity with opera, I would be a casual entusiast.  My library contains several compilation albums, so I am familiar with highlights of many productions without ever having actually seen/listened to an entire opera.  That being said, I felt The Magic Flute was a beautiful and engaging treatment designed for a person right around my familiarity with the genre.  I doubt it would convert any viewer who doesn't care for the musical style, and I cannot critique it at the level of an aficionado, but I can say that it is fun and whimsical and beautifully performed.

I follow Kenneth Branagh's adaption of Shakespearean plays pretty closely and was intrigued when I heard he was working on a project that involved translating The Magic Flute to English.  Personally, I think it was the right choice for the intended audience.  Even if the original German is the superior listening experience, the story is vastly more engaging to the English-speaking world if we are not having to constantly read subtitles or vaguely infer the (quite complicated) plot.  Stephen Fry did a wonderful job translating the libretto.  As far as I was concerned, the singers were all quite good and very attractive.  The acting was more cinematic than theatrical, this was definitely meant to be a movie rather than a recording on the stage, a la CATS.

As for the quality of the movie strictly as a film, it was pretty good.  The story is a bit bizarre and hard to follow at times, but those weaknesses were inherent in the opera from the beginning.  The special effects and overall design ranged from quite good to what I would consider kind of corny, though some of that can be argued away as being ""storybookish"".  All in all, my favorite parts were the performances by the entire ensemble.  They were earnest, silly, romantic, and occasionally touching.  Though this certainly is a strange project, it is a very well-crafted one.  I am peeved that it has yet to be released to the US.  It took me years to get my hands on a copy, but if you can do so, it is well worth the effort.",1340582400,4,2092,4.672131147540983
7909641,5,B00000IBNY,"OK, so here is Kenneth Branagh's attempt to bring Mozart's opera to the English-speaking masses.  The only respected and well-known singer in this production is Ren Pape, who plays Sarastro.  Most of the other singers were a bit lacking in voice and abilities, though not in beautiful teeth, which makes me think Mr. Branagh chose the singers for that characteristic.

But between Rene Pape and Lyubov Petrova (Queen of the Night), and the very beautiful translation of the libretto to English by Stephen Fry (who knew he could do a poetic translation?), this works.

I am not going to pretend that it could be on the same level as a production in Vienna or to Ingmar Bergman's Swedish-language film, but this movie IS successful in making The Magic Flute understandable to English speakers.  I'd happily give this as a present to a neophyte before taking him to the opera in earnest.

However, if you are looking for a good DVD of the opera, the better choice is the ROH's production starring Diana Damrau.  That is the real thing.",1328918400,5,1032,4.764044943820225
7909642,5,B00000IBNY,"This video is excellent to tell a version of the Mozart story, ""The Magic Flute"". I use it in my elementary music classroom after we study ""The Magic Flute"" and we compare/contrast what we have learned to the video. The animation makes it fun for students to watch.",1299801600,2,265,4.541666666666667
7909643,2,B00000IBNY,"I love Mozart.  If you love Mozart, you're not going to be paticularly happy with this.  The plot has been revised, the songs are irritating, and Papageno is a giant chicken!  I keep waiting for him to break out into the Chicken Dance with Papagena.  Still, I rated this two stars instead of just one for the same reason I was kind to another animated opera, ""The Gentlemen of Titipu"", based more or less on ""The Mikado"".  Such films do appeal to children, and it may offer them their very first introduction to such classics.  But that's about all the good I can say.  Everyone else can view it once as a curiosity, if they choose, but it isn't a repeater, and you may have trouble getting through it even once.",1229040000,,712,4.3893129770992365
