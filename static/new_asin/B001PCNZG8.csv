8333134,3,B001PCNZG8,"Regardless of how old it is, porn really hasn't changed much over 100 years. The only change is that now, depending on how old it is, there's different names for them. Stag, vintage, classics, etc. The list goes on and on. These days, older porn movies don't seem to be as popular as it was when it was first produced. Not to say I don't understand, but history is what made everything the way it is now.

This collection of 4 classic porn movies is no exception to that. The DVD set contains 4 movies from 4 different eras. Each movie contains their own story and their own stars. Ideally, this is just a set of old films put on 4 DVD's to try and bring back the golden age of porn. The videos are of ""not so bad"" quality, especially since these were remade from VHS videos. The sound is also not too bad either, considering how old the movies are. Each movie is well over 1 hour long. Despite the fact that the cover DVD looks more modern, these movies are well over 30 years old. Ideally, this DVD set is mostly for collectors of older porn movies or for those who are looking for porn movies who enjoy a bit if history. One thing I will say, if you looking for movies that have none stop sex or looking for movies that have constant nudity, you might want to consider something else. These movies are more for people who appreciate history and understanding where porn movies comes from. These movies are from a time when they were ""trying"" to tell a story to go along with the porn movie. (Granted, yes, porn was exactly that, nudity with sex) Absolutely not recommended for children, adults only.",1381795200,3,1602,4.375838926174497
8333135,1,B001PCNZG8,Might have been ok; but if it does not play and the vendor does nothing  to help it is a rip off.,1368144000,4,97,3.409090909090909
8333136,2,B001PCNZG8,"No, I am not sure why it called comedy but one movie had really good looking chicks and idea. Idea did stop short of realising for unknown reason.
All Western cinema stuck on one point--the connection between man and woman start and ends with connection between one man and one woman. But if reality is different its too bad for reality. In addition these movies are dated and reflect times.",1366502400,,391,4.6
8333137,3,B001PCNZG8,"This is a collection of four films on two DVDs, and I have to say, at least on the first part the title isn't misleading, because these definitely are very European. All four are dubbed, although that's kind of puzzling because in some cases they seem to have been filmed in English originally.

However, I'd call this collection uneven, with only one true comedy among the four, that being ""The Sinful Bed"" from 1974 which actually is very entertaining and hands-down the best of the lot. It follows a bed through many decades of sexual use by couples. It's fun, and often funny, with high production values and plenty of female skin.

But it's ""Pussycat Syndrome"" from 1983 that offers the best in this department, with a buxom Tina Eklund as a model who does a lot of running around with her clothes off, or in a really skimpy little bikini that fits her perfectly. Of course this one gets poinnts off because her co-star is the emaciated and simply gross Ajita Wilson, who spends even more time naked on screen than does Eklund. I wish that I could give a description of the plot here, but there doesn't really seem to be one: lots of nudity, lots of sex (much of which is lesbian in nature) and scenery of exotic locations.

""Love Camp"" wins the title of the weirdest of the films in the collection, although it is fairly watchable. Laura Gemser (the queen of European soft erotica) is tagged as ""The Divine One"" (never is explained why) and leads a religious sex cult in her own honor. Everybody lives in a camp and has sex with everybody else, and there are lots and lots of good-looking women. From time to time they'll dance as a group to rock-and-roll music with strange lyrics. Definitely an oddball film.

""The Exhibitionist"" is really far from being a comedy--it's more like a tragedy, with lots of weeping. Lead character has to put himself on display in order to perform sexually, so he has a lot of trouble consummating the relationship with his wife (a virgin).  The sex is minimal and tame in context, and I found this one to be the least entertaining of all.

One other thing: Don't be thrown by the cover art; nobody in any of these films looks anything like that (unfortunately).",1361232000,10,2200,4.571065989847716
8333138,1,B001PCNZG8,"Pure GARBAGE! Not worth the DVD's this material was copied to! Nothing humorous about this material AT ALL! I was expecting something along a racy ""Benny Hill"" type series of skits or movies and this could be nothing further from it! Not even a ""B"" type movie! Absolutely not worth a dime!",1347580800,3,289,4.576923076923077
8333139,5,B001PCNZG8,I really like this dvd set because it has 4 movies all filled with female nudity at every corner and the girls are very hot. Please don't ask me what the plot to these movies are because its hard to pay any attention to a storyline with you have millions of breasts and hairy vaginas running around for no reason. BUt the movies were shot somewhere in the 70's and early 80's but the girls are natural and full of zest. It is pretty much  softcore entertainment here so if you're looking for something hard please don't waste your money on this movie set. BUt if you are into pretty young vintage butt naked girls  prancing around topless and dancing in the name of fun then this is the way to go. Buy it !,1296691200,26,706,4.222222222222222
