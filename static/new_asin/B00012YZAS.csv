No more worries!  This DVD is perfect, fun, and we can do it together.  He loves his work out time with Mom!",1272499200,,279,4.111111111111111
8005762,5,B00012YZAS,"My daughter is 6 and just loves this exercise DVD.  After watching it the first time I asked her if she liked it.  She said, ""I LOVE it!""  I could tell too, because while she was doing the workout I heard lots of giggles.  She kept running over to me to show me each new ""obstacle"" move.  Very clever DVD.  I know she'll enjoy this one for a long time to come.",1256515200,,360,3.9305555555555554

8005764,5,B00012YZAS,I got this video for my 7 soon to be eight daughter.  I do it with her because I need the exercise.  It was difficult for me easy for her lots of fun for both of us.  It's challenging but do what you can and the next time you'll be able to do a little more.  We loved it and I intend to buy more copies and give them to her friends on their birthdays.  It also encourages using your imagination.  It's more like a game than exercise.,1199750400,,433,3.8636363636363638
