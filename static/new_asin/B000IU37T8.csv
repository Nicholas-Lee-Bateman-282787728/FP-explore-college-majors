2663221,5,B000IU37T8,"I absolutely love that She Ra Princess of Power is now on DVD! The series brings back nice childhood memories. I was pretty young when it first aired in the mid 80's, so seeing the episodes now is like seeing them for the first time, since I can understand what's going on! The show and it's characters are amazing. It is similar to He Man and the Masters of the Universe, but there are some differences. She Ra was more targeted toward a female audience and is a lot more vibrant and whimiscal in some ways. There's Adora's horse that turns into Swift Wind the unicorn when she transforms into She ra. Hordak is leader of the Horde, an evil organization that has taken over the planet Etheria. He Man shows Adora, who was originally part of the Horde, that the group she is leading is corrupt. From then on, she leads ""The Rebels"", those who refuse to bow down to the evil side and allow Hordak and his minions to rule. I loved the episodes where Hordak and Skeletor interact. After all, they used to work together! Of course, Madame Razz is this show's Orko (sounds like the same voice too), and Adora is accompanied by all sorts of interesting people with special powers and creatures called Twiggets. Kowl is one of the best among Adora/She ra's friends. This set is sooo worth getting. You get 32 episodes on 5 discs, and on the 6th disc are all sorts of special features, including a documentary on how the show came to be and commentary on some of the best episodes from season 1, including the popular Sea Hawk episodes, and the lessons on censorship in ""Book Burning"", which are just as relevant today. If only they would make cartoons like this now! What happened! I definitely recommned this. You will not regret it. Show it to your kids so they'll have something good and wholesome to watch like we did!",1164412800,4,1815,4.486404833836858
2663222,5,B000IU37T8,Like a dream come true!!  I'm thrilled that this set is coming out!  Thrilled that I can share with my little girl the same great characters and stories that so enchanted me when I was little!,1164067200,3,192,4.305555555555555
2663223,5,B000IU37T8,"This is a great box set loaded with extras of one of the greatest animated shows of the 1980's.  Even though I probably saw most if not all of these episodes 21 years ago, I don't seem to remember any of them.  Watching them now is still highly enjoyable, even at 34 years old.  I guess I'm still a big kid at heart.  :)

One thing I have noticed when watching the episodes is how much Catra seems to annoy me.  I could really do without all of her catlike sounds while talking!  When she's a person, she should sound more like a person and not how a cat might sound if it could muster up some words from the English language.  Oh well, like it really matters.  I just had to get that off my chest.

I'm sure you can have faith that Entertainment Rights will get the remainder of this series out on DVD as quickly and with the same quality as they did the He-Man series.  Unlike other publishers, they will not leave you hanging.  If you're looking for some great entertainment from yesteryear, you can't miss with this set.  For the Honor of Grayskull!",1163980800,23,1053,4.257575757575758
2663224,5,B000IU37T8,"I still can't believe that She-Ra, Princess of Power is actually out on DVD.  I absolutely loved this show as a little girl.  I pre-ordered this from Amazon and received it 2 days ago.  I've watched all the episodes and one of the documentaries.

The picture quality is great.  The packaging is very attractive and inviting.  I seem to remember someone wondering why the She-Ra series is packaged in pink...it's probably because the original action figures came on pink cards.

There are 6 discs.  The first 5 contain the actual episodes and the 6th is the special features.  Some of the special features require DVD-rom on your computer.  I haven't tried those out yet.  Apparently there is a She-Ra coloring book on this disc.  I'm guessing you can print out the pages.

If you were ever a fan of this series, you won't be disappointed in this set.  I'm anxiously looking forward to the next release.  I hope it's not too far off.",1163548800,3,932,4.631901840490798
2663225,5,B000IU37T8,"In 1985, Mattel riding high from the He-man toys and wildly successful cartoon, tried extending their base into the girls toy department, gave rise to She-Ra, princess of power. And from the beginning, She-ra proves to be more than just a barbie.  Cross connected at first with the he-man series, Adora (She-Ra) is linked to Eternia and prince Adam (he-man) as a twin sister taken by evil Hordak as an infant from Eteria's king and queen.  She was raised By Hordak, but eventually broke free with some help for Castle Greyskull soceress and Adam/He-man (see The he-man/She-ra movie available in She-ra greatest hist set).  Even Hordak was tied into the he-man series as Skeletor's (he-man evil counterpart) Old teacher.  As the series establish, it quickly Developed it's own characters and good stories. This series actually had more funding than the original He-man, and the animation is improved in the She-ra series. I love he-man cartoons, and I didn't watch she-ra that much the first time around, but this set is the opportunity to do so, and it has prove to be great in itself.  a total of 96 episodes were made, so look forward to season 1 vol 2 and complete season 2 to follow within likely the next year. The packaging is great, high quality DVD picture, and bonus collector cards to boot. Great set, worth the money.",1162857600,10,1328,4.781659388646288
2663226,5,B000IU37T8,"At last now that the release of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe's complete series has happened, we can see the beginning half of season one with She-Ra Princess of Power Season 1 Volume 1. Thanks to BCI Eclipse, He-Man's twin sister gets her spotlight. The first five episodes, of course later to be released in movie form called The Secret of the Sword, plus episodes such as King Miro's Journey. That episode of course when Randor's father crosses over to She-Ra, also marking a cross over from He-Man himself. Also The Sea Hawk, where we are first introduced to Sea Hawk and in which we begin to see a hint of romance between Hawk and Adora.

And don't forget other important aspects to these releases. We have a new batch of art cards, as well as the Stories of She-Ra Princess of Power part 1, with more documentaries, commentaries with Andy Mangels. Now we need shows such as He-Man and She-Ra to let us know and remind us of the decency and quality of animation back in the day. Where violence and shows that could result with a drug induced psychosis weren't a factor, it was just fantasy and fun.

Well I await with baited breath the arrival of the first volume of She-Ra's first season. And I can not wait for the rest of the volumes to make their appearance so I can own not only He-Man's complete series, but She-Ra as well. Thanks to BCI Eclipse for making this show accessible to viewers.

2663251,4,B000IU37T8,"I bought this new, still wrapped in its plastic, and I absolutely LOVE it. The only problem I've encountered so far, and the only thing that has stopped me from giving it full stars, is that I can't seem to turn the commentary for King Miro's Journey (on disc 2) off no matter what I do. It's the only problem I've encountered with the set. However, everything else is great and this DVD box set completes my collection of the cartoon series. I'm so glad I picked it up! This cartoon series definitely stands the test of time and, if you ask me, ended too early. I think any kid could benefit from watching this series, and She-Ra and Adora make great role models for girls. Phenomenal animation and art, great and engaging characters, wonderful morals. And for those of us who grew up with the show, there's great commentary from people who worked behind-the-scenes on the show to make it happen, as well as other great goodies in the extras that are just a superbly wonderful treat.

Buying the Secret of the Sword separately can be over $50, but this season has that and more for a lot less. I remember watching She-Ra, and I enjoyed it, but it was always too 'cutesy' for me at the same time. There were too many unicorns, pretty flowers, and sparkly moments if that makes any sense. They gave She-Ra a sword and strength, but like Zena, they only let her use kid gloves. Anyway, the disc collection arrived well-packed and in good condition, box and all. Delivery and price were good as well, and the Secret of the Sword episodes help complete my He-Man collection I have going.",1405900800,2,683,4.472

Vol. 2) of She-ra. The Secret of the Sword pilot movie are slipt into the first 5 episodes. It tells how Adora finds out that she's Adam's(He-man)sister and how she joins the Great Rebelian and their fight aginst Hordak. The other episodes just follow Adora/She-Ra's many adventures. I have a couple of favorets episodes like:
The Price of Freedom.
The Return of Sea Hawk.
The Reluctant Wizard.
The Crystal Castle.
The Stone in the Sword.
He Ain't Heavy.
and
The peril of Whispering Woods.
My favorites are the episodes where He-man crosses over---those are the BEST I think.

2663317,4,B000IU37T8,"So, out of all the 80's cartoon DVD sets that I've procured in the past 7 or so years I keep getting amazed by the ones that stand out as my favorites as far as content and presentation. I grew up addicted to shows like He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, G.I. Joe, Transformers, the Silverhawks and Bravestarr for the most part; you know manly shows full of action and misfired lasers that never seemed to hit anything more important than rocks and the odd robot. There were a handful of shows that barely hit my radar like Robotech (too soap opera-y, you can see my thoughts on the show here), Jem (a guilty pleasure to be sure), and She-Ra Princess of Power, which just seemed like He-Man for girls.

When I sat down and started watching She-Ra recently, I was immediately struck by how wrong I was, and it's made for a lot of fun recent cartoon watching. If you haven't seen it, the show is a spin-off of He-Man that deals with the land of Etheria (which I think is actually a planet, though like Erternia in He-Man that's confounded me for years) and its inhabitants battling to get free of Hordak and his evil Horde (a mixture of He-Man-esque villains and stormtrooper-like robot things) who rule over the world. As you find out in the five-episode movie, the Secret of the Sword, which kicks of the DVD set (also available on the Best Of She-Ra set), one of Hordak's minions Adora (who was Captain of the Horde Troopers) is actually the long lost twin sister of Prince Adam, aka He-Man, who helps to free her of the magical hold that Hordak (via another minion Shadow Weaver) has on her. Adam brought a special sword (the Sword of Protection) for Adora, which like his Sword of Power has the ability with the power of Greyskull to transform her into the mighty She-Ra. Adora then bands together with a rag tag group of rebels to help build a rebellion against Hordak like so many Star Wars movie cliches.

This for me, is actually what sets She-Ra apart from He-Man and most of the cartoons of the 80's in that the heroes are coming from the losing side against an evil that has for all intents and purposes already succeeded in it's goal of world domination. Typically it's always the other way around in cartoons, so to have the balance of power shifted is pretty interesting. I also really dig the oppressing technology-minded world of the Horde, which is destroying all that's good and natural in Etheria. It ends up feeling very Matrix like in this respect.  The landscapes and backgrounds are a hell of a lot more interesting with disturbing hidden words like 'obey' and 'evil' in the various bits of machinery and stuff. It makes for an over all darker show and the motivations of the characters end up being a little more relatable.

Of course being an 80's cartoon, the show does suffer from a ton of stereotypes. It's truly a mirror image of the He-Man cartoon with a cast of mostly female characters, Princess Glimmer, Queen Angella, Frosta and Madame Razz (who is the equivalent of Orko) and only one guy, Bow (the bizzaro version of Teela) as well as Spirit, Adora's horse who turns into Swift Wind the winged unicorn ala Cringer to Battle Cat when Adors becomes She-Ra. To sort of cement it as a ""girl's show"" there are some very Disney-esque talking animals/animated-inanimate objects with the addition of Kowl, a weird creature that's some sort of cross between an owl, a flying squirrel and a box of crayons as well as Broom, Madame Razz's sidekick that is what it's name suggests. The names of the places are all very ""girly"" as well, what with the Whispering Woods and the Crystal Castle (which has a gate keeper named Lighthope that's one of four people to know Adora's secret of being She-Ra (filled out by Kowl, Madame Razz & Broom.) Well I guess there are actually six people who know seeing as He-Man and the Sorceress also know. Damn it, there's also Sprit/Swift Wind, and I'm sure Cringer/Battle Cat, Man-At-Arms, and Orko all know seeing as Prince Adam confides in them as well. Fine, everybody probably knows. Secrets schmeecrets. Anyway, I think these 80's stereotypes actually help to accentuate the show from a nostalgia prospective.

The show has also been fun to watch for its variations on common 80's cartoon conventions, for instance the moral at the end of the show. In every episode of She-Ra there is a character named Loo-Kee (which I think is sort of named for Loki the Norse god of mischief) who is hiding somewhere in one of the backgrounds and at the end of the show he pops up to let you know where he was and to help you with the moral for the show. I thought was pretty ingenious as kids will be more likely to listen to what he's saying because they spent the last half hour subconsciously trying to find him. The Show is also a great example of how you don't need to stick to stereotypes to market a cartoon. Though it's obviously for girls, it's more or less a carbon copy of He-Man, which is stereotypically for boys and proves that both boys and girls can like the same things and don't have to be separated. It's surely a show that set up the groundwork for action shows like Justice League and Teen Titans that are marketed to both boys and girls.

I know I'm beginning to sound like a broken record with this, but once again this DVD set was released by BCI Eclipse, under their Ink & Paint division, which has done an amazing job with package and menu design, presentation of the content, not to mention a bunch of fun special features. There's a new installment of the behind the scenes documentary series by Andy Mangels, which ran through the entire He-Man series of DVDs and just as interesting and informative, as well as games, character profiles and some commentaries. All in all, with 33 episodes, the worthwhile extras, and the beautiful packaging, for around $30 you definitely get your money's worth with this set.",1244678400,2,5892,4.574810606060606

However, there are 2 things that have been bugging me about the shows. The two things that has been bugging me since I received the set is how underutilized and invisible some of She-Ra's friends are and that some of their powers' are inconsistent and random.

1.) Strong, powerful characters such as Frosta aren't in any of the shows from the first season DVD box set. Believe it or not, you won't see Frosta until volume 2, season 1 and that's only ONCE!!! The same applies to Mermista as well!!! Castaspella thankfully makes a few appearances, but the writers of the show limited the extent of her air-time and in showing how magical she is. She proves it on Season 1, Volume 2 a few times though.

2.) Other characters such as the very powerful Queen Angella (she is way too underutilized) and even her daughter Glimmer seem to have selective use of their magic and power. It doesn't make sense that Queen Angella can bring down the whole Horde Army at certain times and then sits on her throne acting as if she's helpless, frightened, and powerless. Glimmer also suffers from the same ""affliction"" her mother does. The only difference is that Glimmer's magical abilities and powers are more inconsistent and randomly used.

Instead of seeing She-Ra fight side by side with powerful characters such as Castaspella, Frosta, Mermista, and Queen Angella, we instead get to see her fighting with BOW, MADAME RAZZ, BROOM, and KOWL all the time??? With the exception of Bow, the other 3 are useless. However, they are very colorful characters!

Truly, I love all the shows and am happy they are back. I just couldn't resist writing about She-Ra's friends and who I would have preferred seeing in battle.

If you had to choose, would you prefer the team of Madame Razz, Broom, and Kowl fighting with She-Ra all the time or Queen Angella, Frosta, and Castaspella instead???",1215993600,,2125,4.653333333333333
2663324,4,B000IU37T8,"Time for a confession: As an animation-loving kid in the 1980s, I didn't care much for She-Ra. Don't get me wrong, I gave her obligatory respect for being He-Man's twin-sister and all but I would be lying if I told you that I was glued to the set for She-Ra's adventures in Etheria the way I anticipated He-Man's romps through Eternia. Blame it on poor timing. After all, She-Ra's meteoric rise into culture coincided with my own ""all girls have cooties"" phase. What's worse is that most of my cartoon enjoyment back in those days was derived directly from my ability to recreate the magic through my action figures. Since She-Ra's toy line looked much more feminine than the muscular brutes that made up my Masters of the Universe collection, I simply found myself shrugging off the whole phenomenon in favor of my He-Man only regime.

As time marched on I made a series of shocking discoveries about not only She-Ra and company but the fairer sex in general: They're not only fun to watch in action but a vast majority of them do not in fact have cooties. Enter She-Ra The Princess of Power Season One, Volume 1 from BCI. This beautifully packaged 6-disc compilation not only picks up right where its He-Man counterparts left off, it does so with finesse, grace, and style (all things I couldn't have cared less about the first time around).

The structure of the show, for those who have somehow managed to steer clear of it throughout the years, is very similar to He-Man. In fact the cast was structured intentionally so that nearly every He-Man and the Masters of the Universe character had a counterpart in She-Ra Princess of Power. The show even shared many of the same writers with its male-driven sibling series. What's most interesting about Season One is that despite the fact that Filmation had the writing and animation process of producing this type of show down to a science at the time, the company clearly struggled to find a natural balance of She-Ra's powers and abilities. This is especially apparent early on when we encounter episodes where She-Ra possesses such gifts as the ability to communicate telepathically and to heal wounded or injured animals with her touch only to sort of fade away by later episodes. Apparently (and probably sensibly) the show's writers wished to replace He-Man's sheer strength with more female-friendly abilities. Ultimately, by the conclusion of the first series many of these bugs had been worked out by the creative team behind the production and the compromise that stuck was She-Ra's ability to transform her sword into various shapes upon her command. While I'm not still entirely impressed with this odd deviation from Prince Adam's Grayskull-given talents, I will say that at least it is not an overused gimmick.

Also new to the series was the scope of the villainy. He-Man typically consisted of two types of foes: His rouge's gallery (Skeletor and company) who would devise a devious plot only to be shut down by He-Man or a creatively adopted fairytale moral. She-Ra takes a new twist on this trend by starting out a member of the Evil Horde herself. Brainwashed from birth, she is made to see the error in her (and their) ways only after a visit from her twin brother Adam. Then once her flip-flop to the forces of good (the Great Rebellion) the viewer is given an enemy that is much easier to despise in the Horde. Rather than simply a bunch of sideshow rejects stowed away in lava-land, the Horde takes on the presence of a totalitarian government with its agents acting as corrupt police officers (kind of like the Stormtroopers from Star Wars). This works out pretty well in the long-term and provides a much stronger viewer-passion for good to triumph over evil.

Also new to the formula is Loo-Kee, a strange little rainbow colored creature who is hidden in the background of every episode. At the end he reveals his location just before offering up the standard moral tag that Orko handled in He-Man. The creative team confessed despising the whole Loo-Kee gimmick but I have to be honest here, looking for him is rather addicting. And just to settle any bets, Loo-Key predated the very popular Where's Waldo phenomenon that would follow shortly thereafter.

All in all, the animation surpasses the efforts witnessed in He-Man (due to a larger budget). My biggest compliant of the first season may come as a surprise considering how I started this review: I actually feel that He-Man crossover episodes are a bit too common. As an original He-Fan, this may sound like blasphemy but it seems like every time She-Ra would start to gain a little momentum on her own, the writers felt the need to toss He-Man into the formula and basically reset the system. It seems to me like She-Ra's universe contains so many interesting characters and environments that we see so little of to begin with that overloading us with the brother and sister duo distracts from the uniqueness of the She-Ra experience. I'm hoping this was rectified in later episodes.

As far as the 6-disc compilation goes, this is standard BCI goodness, which is to say sheer perfection from a collector's standpoint. The box art and inner flip-sleeve are spot-on and like always the episode guide and even the disc art go way above and beyond industry standard. Also included is the requisite pair of collector art cards this time by Dave Johnson and Humberto Ramos. Many readers have written in to express confusion as to whether or not the feature-length She-Ra animated movie, The Secret of the Sword is included on this compilation. The answer is that it is indeed. It is simply broken up into the first 5 episodes of disc 1. For those who long for the uninterrupted cinematic experience, BCI does offer the film as a standalone set that also includes the top five episodes of the series as voted on by fans entitled The Best of She-Ra Princess of Power (yes, I will be reviewing that set soon as well).

As for extra features, Season One, Volume 1 again takes no shorts (and is only slightly less impressive when compared directly to the amazing amounts of information BCI jammed into their He-Man collections). Among the gems here are 2 full episode commentaries by members of the creative staff (including the writers). Also (and my favorite) are The Stories of She-Ra, a documentary segment where the show's writers explain their motivation and thought process behind various episodes of the season.

Also included are a full length animated storyboard comparison, 50 character profiles, Facts and Trivia section, and DVD-ROM entries of 5 complete episode scripts, the She-Ra series bible, Secret of the Sword comic book, and She-Ra coloring book.

Included on this installment are the following 32 episodes:

I couldn't wait to get home from school everyday to watch this.  Then sadly one day, I found out that they changed the scheduled time and I was unable to watch it. :-( Then the show stopped altogther.

This is the best animation that's out there!  The time and effort put into the characters, and scripts is outstanding!  The animated shows that are out now, lack the quality and vibrance that the He-Man and She-Ra series have.  The art on the box and cards, along with the bonus features are excellent.

2663341,5,B000IU37T8,"Of course, it's important to love the series in order to even think of purchasing the box set, but the actual presentation of the box set matters just as much. Fortunately, the She-RA Volume 1 box set is absolutely gorgeous, I've never seen such a well done box set before. Each disc has its very own unique cover (for example, one disc will have the upper body of She-RA, Glimmer, or Hordak, and so on) with a matching back cover for each disc mount, and the artwork is high quality.

Special features last for hours and the extras such as scripts and special edition cards are the little things that aren't necessary, but very nice to have. And the episodes aren't just listed, each have their own little preview clip. As you can probably guess, this is a rather hefty box set, but the spine artwork is lovely, so it's worth leaving out. It also serves as a great reminder that, yes, the rest of the series will be released on DVD.

The only flaw (and I find this to be a major one) is the episode chapter selections. Each episode has two chapter selections, so if you just want to skip the opening credits and get right to the action, you can-- but you'll also miss half the episode.",1176249600,7,1186,4.386363636363637

2663343,5,B000IU37T8,"Ahhh yes, Sh-Ra. I barely remember running around my house as a youngster whenever the transformation scene played. I thought it would be fun to check out She-Ra again when the best-of disc came out and again I ws hooked...hence this purchase. The plots are funny, and the characters very cute. Gotta love Bo's costume ;)My boyfriend even likes watching, mainly thanks to Glim ;p

Basically it's a great kid's show. No severe violence, such as death or blood. Most foils of evil involve some form of spinning or trap. Those who do get hurt don't bruise, so it would be important to expalin to a youngster how unrealistic it is (but there are flying horses so it's kinda a given).

There is some minor violence so I wouldn't show this to anyone under 4 or 5. But other than that it's cute, and more fanciful than He-Man. It involves moralistic stories about what the ""right thing"" to do is (i.e. don't lie, don't steal etc). The chicks are drawn reeally well, as my boi would point out, and the other characters are funny imho.

I would definately suggest this title to those who love She-Ra, and those who are new to the series. The quality is great, and the special features were cool.

The shows are just as imaginative, exciting, and fun-to-watch as they were when I was a pre-tween.  I especially liked the storywriters commentaries about the development of Etheria, the characters, and the differences with Eternia.

When I was young I loved the story, characters, and artwork.  Now as an adult, I can fully appreciate the social and political commentaries that permeate each episode (government corruption, team-work, fighting for ones values, negotiations over violence, love, respect, kindness, and wisdom).

It seems, many years after the shows ended, that we all can still find a little bit of these heroes and heroines in all of us.  Can't wait for the Volume 2 to be released!

2663345,5,B000IU37T8,"Finally I can see it for the first time in English and all the episodes.

She-Ra is a female heroine with a great power and lots of lessons for all of us, young and not so young. I am from Mexico and previously I had not been able to watch most episodes, but I have been obssesed with She-Ra most of my life. When I was 12 I claimed in my local video rental store to have lost the video of the Secret of the Sword, then two years ago I found in Amazon.com the VHS version.

My delight in discovering that the series was to be released on DVD knew no bounds, I purchase the 10 best episodes last summer and then discovered He-Man.org and found out about the special variant of the Secret of the Sword and bought it.

I used to watch the series with my little brother and we used to play at being  She-Ra and He-Man.

It is a fantastic tale of a young woman who discovers her destiny in wielding a great power for the protection of others. Before she can wield the Sword of Protection and become She-Ra she must overcome a spell tat has made her subservient to the Evil Horde.
When she and He-Man contact the Sorceress of Greyskull and she shows them as infants in their mother's arms I cried too.

When the movie was over my brother and I used to hugh and go play together.

For me She-Ra is the tale of a heroine that showed me to be nice to other people and to appreciate my brother, I can't imagine not having had someone to play with.

The fact that after 20 years I still love every minute of it doesn't bother me, I'm still a little girl at heart who loves cartoons, heroines and especially princess heroines.

They are soooooo generic, and sloppy!  Well most anyways!  This show did not only contain great animation, but great story lines as well.

The She-Ra series was one of my favorite cartoons series when I was  a child.  I was happy to see a female character in a strong role because so many of us didn't have a strong leader figure to look up to.  So many of us looked up to women on TV like Wonder Woman and Bionic Woman as a type of role model.  She-Ra gave many of us hope that women could be more than second best when compared to men.  Even as a child we role played that we were either
She-Ra, Wonder Woman, Bionic Woman and/or Cheetara from the thundercats.  Let me tell you, we showed the boys in my neighborhood no mercy.  Hahahaha!!!
