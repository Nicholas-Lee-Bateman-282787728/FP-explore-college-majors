8214493,5,6302968992,"I have been looking like a video such as this for years.  This video can be done easily without too much stress or effort.  I took ballet years ago and wondered if there was a video that incorporated a little aerobic with a ballet-type flare.  Even if you have not have ballet experience, you will enjoy this light-easy to use exercise program.  I have asthma and a bad back and it was not too strenuous for me, yet I did get my heart beat going.

If you want to be perspiring when you are finish with the video, as in such high aerobics programs, you will be disappointed.  However, this will allow the average person, male or female, to feel stretched, a tiny bit winded, and so much better when finishing the exercises.

I am so pleased that this video was made.  It was just what I have been looking for in the others I have purchased.  One does feel rejuenivated after using this light-aerobic, stretch program.  I can hardly wait to use it daily.

Thank you for developing this program for those who can't jump or exercise at a high heart rate.  It is perfect for me and I believe it will be just what you have been wanting also.

This video looks so simple, but it's really hard(you need to have lots of balance). There's no jumping around, but I'm sweating nicely when I'm done. I wish I knew of more workouts like this one. I also purchased More Rejuvenetics, which is a toning workout that I enjoy also.

I just purchased Beachbody's Yoga Booty Ballet Goddess Set, which I'm hoping is going to be similar to this video.

There's a lot of great, older workouts out there which unfortunately are overlooked. I'm glad I found this one.",1112659200,,672,4.686440677966102
8214495,5,6302968992,"I walk, lift weights, swim and regularly vary my exercise routine and I'm always amazed how comprehensive the Rejuvenetics workout truly is.  Every time I complete the video, I feel good all over... it reaches every muscle group, stretches your spine, tones and strengthens while at the same time improves your balance, posture and gracefulness.  I am always surprised at how tired my arms get from the simple lifting movements and a day or two following the routine, I am tender in all the right places... the kind of soreness that let's you know you truly had a complete workout.  I love the mix of ballet, t'ai chi and yoga and when I'm done with the workout, I've worked up a light sweat and breathing deeply.  Don't let the simpleness of the routine fool you... it looks easy but try it and see how you look and feel after a few weeks of regular workouts.  I tell all my friends about this video.",1007078400,2,901,4.5030674846625764
8214496,5,6302968992,"This tape presents a sequence of dance-type moves done slowly and continually.  None of it is hard to understand though I found one part interestingly difficult to master.  The majority of the sequence  involves BALANCE and I feel like I am cultivating grace by doing these  exercises.  The first few times I went through the tape, I had to touch my  foot to the floor very often to keep my balance.  But I was happy that I  improved very quickly.  The move I found most difficult to repeat was  a very simple grapevine step.  My mind just didn't want to do it that way!  The teacher emphasizes that this set of exercises is for the mind as well  as the body.  The exercises are not vigorous but they are continuous  and I always feel glowy and have a light sheen of sweat on my body when I'm  finished with them.  To my knowledge there are few videos that  are so devoted to BALANCE.  I know I will continue this regime til I can do  it effortlessly from beginning to end.",951091200,2,973,4.3
