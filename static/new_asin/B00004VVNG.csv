7924359,1,B00004VVNG,"You do NOT want this DVD. Here's the what it basically is:
-it begins with a picture of all 3 guys and scrolls their names in front of each band member. problem is that whoever made this stupid DVD mixed up mark and tom, so immediately the whole DVD is ruined
-a long-haired idiot who wears glasses trying to talk like he's cool and knows blink-182. he periodically shows up throughout the DVD with his stupid hair
-interviews with a jonathen davis-wannabe, a porn star, a tattoo artist, and two random nobodys
-a 15-minute piece on the girl who kissed travis in the ""All The Small Things"" video and how she feels about it now
-clips of a random skater
-clips of fans from england
that's about it. the band's apperance on the DVD, when all put together, lasts about 5-6 minutes. the music's not even by blink. spend your money on something less crappy.",1073260800,13,852,4.503225806451613
7924360,1,B00004VVNG,"This is the worst dvd I have ever purchased.  800 dot c-o-m agreed to refund my money because Blink 182 is not the subject of the video.  A two-bit b-movie actress, a goofy narrator, and some guy from a failed LA band talk about Blink 182--a band they do NOT know!  What a bore!  Stay away at all costs!",1025827200,12,303,4.084745762711864
7924361,1,B00004VVNG,"First of all, the members of Blink 182 are barely in the video. Second of all, the people on the video are so far removed from Blink 182. For example, they interview a porn star who acted with Janine, the porn star on the cover of Blink 182's album ""Enema of the State"". She's never even met the members of Blink! She talks about Janine! Who cares? Third of all, the video looks like it was made in someone's garage. If you want a video about Blink 182, this isn't the video for you.",1008633600,17,483,4.148936170212766
7924362,1,B00004VVNG,"I am a die hard Blink 182 fan, the last three times they have come to Texas i have seen them.  I would drive almost anywere to see them.  So of course when i saw that they had another DVD out i was like sure sign me up, i'll take one.  Well lets say that I was dissapointed to say the least.  The movie has practially nothing to do with Blink 182, except for a few 2 or 3 minute shots of them runing over some bottles in a car.  The DVD is really about the girl in the Josie video, a porn star, and a bunch of British people.  And to top it all off there is no Blink music in the whole DVD.  So I'm not saying don't buy this movie, I'm just trying to warn a few people before they make the same mistake I did.",1004659200,14,709,3.7181208053691277
7924363,1,B00004VVNG,"OK, I am a really big blink fan. I have been ever since Enema of the State came out but when I got this video for christmas a couple days after I got it I watched it and found out this video was horrible. I watched the first five minutes of it and then I just had to turn it off. First of all it had on it was all this junk about Porno stars and everything. I think the only relation to blink 182 this would have is their name on the video and that Janine from their album cover used to be a Porn star. This movie is horrible and I think if Mark, Tom, or Travis saw this they might find it a tad bit funny but might be annoyed by the fact that their name is on it and it has barely anything about them on it. This is a horrible video and I would not recommend buying at whatever age you may be.",978739200,22,794,3.732142857142857
7924364,1,B00004VVNG,"i purchased this video and it was horrible. it was so horrible in fact that i broke it. it has no music or concerts by blink and if it didn't say on the cover you wouldn't know it had anything to do with Blink 182. if you're considering buying this, don't, buy the Urethra Chronicles instead. i have that and it's great. don't buy this. it is a waste of plastic.",975283200,8,362,4.112676056338028
