2925160,5,B000USUA8E,"Another great season including ""Kenny Dies"", in which Cartman lets Kenny die, favoring a new Shakies Pizza over his terminally ill friend.

8214652,5,B000USUA8E,"Season 5 the best Season.........funny and RARE !
You can only find the original ""Super Best Friends"" episode here, in the ORIGINAL YELLOW BOX.  It has since been edited because of a certain religious depiction, and is NOT AVAILABLE on SouthPark.com.  Also, ""Scott Tenorman Must Die""....and the Original ""Towelie"" episode.  Also ""Cripple Fight"", ""Cartmanland"", and ""Butters Very Own Episode.""  If you are looking for South Park's best.........
Season 5, ORIGINAL YELLOW BOX is a real collectors item.",1404691200,7,500,5.454545454545454
