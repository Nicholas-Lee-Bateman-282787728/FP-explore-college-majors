2126340,4,B0002VF4PI,I loved the whole Lovejoy series. The earlier ones are better. Love Erick and Tinker.,1425168000,,85,4.733333333333333
2126341,5,B0002VF4PI,"This series 4 has two of my favorite episodes!  It also has a Christmas special that I have somehow missed seeing through the years. How delightful!  Each series of LOVEJOY is entertaining and educational....you always learn something ""real"" about antiques.  Best of all are the unforgettable characters, both regular and guest stars.  The Napoleon's Commode episode pokes fun at the character who is an expert among experts.  Having grown up in an area of this country that has rabid experts on both Colonial and Civil War items, I felt as though I had met this character many times!  It is good fun, and quite a run around of an episode.  I also love the episode concerning Mary Queen of Scots's billiard table.  Not only is Lady Jane's involvement in this episode stunning (Phyllis Logan is a superb actress whether playing Lady Jane  or Mrs Hughes in Downton Abbey) but this episode highlights the humanity of an icon is historical figure. Have you ever thought of Mary Queen of Scots playing billiards or owning a billiards table?  I highly recommend this series for anyone who enjoys mysteries and antiques and well crafted and superbly acted series. Good fun!",1422662400,,1166,4.873096446700508
2126342,5,B0002VF4PI,"This may be the most enjoyable season of the Lovejoy series, the last season in which Lady Jane (Phyllis Logan) appears, and features increasingly fun and interesting mystery/adventures. Every episode is a treat, but Fly the Flag and Second Fiddle are both such clever episodes, you'll watch them again to catch all the clues. As always Denis King's signature theme song sticks in your head, but in a good way, a reminder of the time when good TV shows had real and recognizable themes (think Hill St Blues, Cagney & Lacey, Magnum, The Rockford Files). This season's guest stars include a pre-Doc Martin appearance by Martin Clunes. This newly released version by Acorn offers clear, crisp visuals that invite all of us to spend time in the English countryside and tag along with Lovejoy, Jane, Tink and Eric. Indulge in binge-watching and feel new appreciation for this deft and entertaining series. Lovejoy rules!",1421712000,,915,4.9869281045751634
2126343,5,B0002VF4PI,"LOVEJOY, Series 4. That handsome rogue, Golden Globe winner Ian McShane (so winning in DEADWOOD) is an antiques dealer and part-time detective, described by the Washington Post as one of televisions most charming and appealing characters, in this cult favorite British comedy/crime drama. The hit television series, loosely based on the fast-paced British mystery novels by Jonathan Gash, was made in the 1980s and 90s, seen on the BBC for six series, (1986, 1991-1994), and, in the United States, on A & E.  Lovejoy (we never learn his first name) has an eye for a find, a forgery, the ladies, and a good sob story. With  a young Phyllis Logan, (DOWNTON ABBEYS Mrs. Hughes), as Lady Jane Felsham, married well-heeled decorator, partner to Lovejoy; Dudley Sutton, (THE BEIDERBECK CONNECTION), as Tinker and Chris Jury, (THE BIG GAME), as Eric Catchpole. I was given this as a review copy. The box series consists of 13 episodes on 4DVDs, runs approximately 693 minutesover 13 hours, plus  a bonus Christmas special The Prague Sun, running a feature-length 97 min. The series contains brief coarse language and nudity; mind you, its makers warn that, due to the age of the original material, they have not always been able to restore it to top DVD condition. But thankfully, they have given us subtitles, for who would want to miss a minute of this light-hearted whodunits fun!

Lovejoy, called a divvy by his colleagues, apparently a person who can just smell a great antique, was called the James Bond of antiques dealers by the New York Times.  Guest stars in Series 4 include Martin Clunes (DOC MARTIN); Ronald Pickup (THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL); Leslie Phillips (VENUS) and Richard Griffiths (HARRY POTTER, THE HISTORY BOYS).  Also, Michael Horden (SCROOGE, 1977); Ronald Pickup(THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL);Liz Smith (LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD)and Henry Goodman, (NOTTING HILL). And TP McKenna (BLEAK HOUSE); John Kavanagh (TUDORS, BRAVEHEART); Andrew Connolly (BRAMWELL); Dinah Sheridan, Peter Vaughan and the always threatening Donald Pleasence,(YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE).

The episodes are, with thanks to RLJ Entertainment/Acorn:

BONUS Christmas special The Prague Sun (97 min, divided into two episodes)
A  war veteran thought to be dead returns after a 50-year absence to claim some buried diamonds. But someone else has his eye on them.

As Lovejoy uses his wit and charm to buy/sell, and help solve the various mysteries/problems that come his way, he also enjoyably scours the salesrooms, auction houses and stately homes of Britain, all ensconced in beautiful scenery. And, we discover McShane/Lovejoy can sing in Series 4.  Theres no violence, no blood and gore in this popular, saucy entertainment, and only the most respectful of sex. I never missed this show when it was on A & E, and am very happy to have it on DVD. My favorite aunt, and oh, how I loved her, was an antiques dealer, which has left me with a lasting interest in the business.  Recommended.",1421193600,,6147,4.9765625
2126344,5,B0002VF4PI,"I've learned to expect 6 stars worth of entertainment from this series.
Lovejoy aired 1986 to early 90s. This set is 1993, Series 4. Nostalgic Brit drama based on antiques, not traditional crime. Lovejoy (Ian McShane) is a likable rogue dealer of antiquities. He's a divvy (aka gifted spotter of antique value) sometimes bordering on unlawful, con, and charmed sleuth. I love shopping antiques, thus this series is a treasure. LOOSELY based on Jonathan Gash novels. Over 13 hours total viewing.

Regular cast (characters all exquisitely developed) includes ""Tink"" (Dudley Sutton -`Beiderbecke' trilogy) a divvy who drinks too much; Eric Catchpole (Chris Jury) apprentice turned partner; Lady Jane Felsham (Phyllis Logan -a young Mrs `Downton Abbey' Hughes) a married rich decorator and antique crony. Gimbert (Malcolm Tierney) Lovejoy's dealer nemesis. Plus guest stars of the 90s to today.

2126345,5,B0002VF4PI,"I picked this up from Canada, Series four on 4 discs.  This was a great British mystery show that aired on A & E in the early 90's then just completely disappeared.  I never understood that.  The only way to enjoy this show was to buy the 4 episode VHS set for a rather high price.  Now, the shows can be enjoyed on dvd with the great English countryside as a backdrop for Lovejoy, Tinker, and Eric to do what they do best.  The episodes are:

The Prague Sun

The Napoleonic Commode

The Ring

Second Fiddle

The Colour of Mary

Fly the Flag

Judgement of Solomon

The Galloping Major

God Helps Those

They Call Me Midas

Irish Stew

Dainty Dish

Taking the Pledge

Lovejoy Loses It

This also includes part 4 of an exclusive interview with Ian McShane.  If you enjoyed this show when it aired over a decade ago, you must pick this up, great stuff.  Over 750 minutes!",1177027200,9,868,4.29375
2126346,4,B0002VF4PI,Please re-release all the Lovejoy shows.  Who can afford these prices???  It's such a fun show.,1157760000,9,95,4.875
2126347,5,B0002VF4PI,"This is the fourth set of Lovejoy episodes. They had moved away from the grainy film and into the ""warm"" polished quality, which served to set the higher tone for Lovejoy. The episodes were deftly written, sharply directed and brilliantly brought to life by the cast. McShane is at his most lovable rogue in the best episodes of the Series!!

The Prague Sun (a movie length 2-part Christmas Episode has Lovejoy doing a St. Nic appearance!)

The Napoleonic Commode - Jane and Lovejoy find a Napoleonic commode, minus the bowl - if they can just ""fix"" that a bit they will score big

The Ring - Lovejoy needs money to float his new effort. He hits upon buying a series of painting and if he can sell one for a high price then he can sell them all. He calls upon old shady pals to see the price goes up, but it backfires when he pulls Lady Jane into the scam

Second Fiddle - has Tinker, Eric and Lovejoy in period costume (must admit while Tinker and Eric don't fare too well, McShane looks as if he was born for the period!) The episode has Lovejoy playing musical chairs with fiddles - the rare kind!

The Colour of Mary - Lady Jane shines in the episode when she gives her speech of how Mary Queen of Scots was executed. Lovejoy needs to find Mary's old pool table

The Judgement of Solomon - has a shifty major trying to shift stole items from the Jews during WWII, but our rogue is there to save the day for everyone

The Galloping Major - in a series of events, Lovejoy find an ancient cannon, which soon has everyone going around and around to prove it's a rare Cromwellian cannon

God Helps Those - Jane tricks Lovejoy into decorating a pub for a friend, also a friend of Tinkers. When Lovejoy and Jane get scammed, it's up to Lovejoy to help those in need

They Call Me Midas - an old friend lure Lovejoy, Jane, Tinker and Eric into role-playing for the weekend to sell a fake to an arrogant art collector

Irish Stew - Jane, Tinker, Eric and Lovejoy go on the knock up in Ireland and get caught in the mystery surrounding a dying actress and the missing ancient book

Dainty Dishes - Lovejoy and crew go to Brighton Beach to help Jane's distant relation. They go on a scavenger hunt for dishes to complete a special set, while misdirecting Charlie with chairs

Taking the Pledge - an old friend James Kinkardine looks up Lovejoy trying to get back an item he pawned, yet keep it away from the grasping ex-wife, while Jane is getting romanced and scammed

Lovejoy Loses it - a super episode where Lovejoy alienates Eric, Tinker and Jane as he goes on telly as divvy star. When he goofs on an estate evaluation, he has to pull himself around or face losing the people he cares about.

These are some of the best episodes. When I watch them I keep going ""oh this is my fav!"" - for each one of them!! They are just that good.",1157500800,18,2829,4.323251417769376
