2076329,5,B0002COTDA,I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS!! I PREORDERED THIS COLUMBO DVD SET TODAY(6-11-04). THE DVD SET GETS 5 STARS SIGHT-UNSEEN BECAUSE COLUMBO IS A CLASSIC! I HOPE ALL COLUMBO SEASONS WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT SOON AFTER THIS SET!!,1087084800,5,231,4.8
2076330,5,B0002COTDA,"It's about time!  Universal Studios should release the 2nd season ASAP.
Columbo's plot-lines created unique, unrivaled intrigue and mystery.  Los Angeles' ace detective uncovered overwhelming circumstantial evidence, hounded murderers, and forced them to confess when confronted.  We never knew the sentence, but who cares?  No one was too clever for Columbo.
(...)I gave Columbo 5 stars without looking at the DVDs and pre-ordered.  Columbo is that good.",1086480000,6,455,5.731343283582089
2076331,5,B0002COTDA,"It's great to see Lt. Columbo is finally going to make it on DVD!  For those familiar with the cigar-smoking detective in the rumpled raincoat only through the specials produced in the 90s, the originial 1970s episodes show Columbo in his prime.
Most people are familiar with the Columbo formula:  guest star plots murder; guest star kills victim (a series trademark - we know all along who the killer is); Columbo appears on scene; Columbo investigates - ""Ahh, just one more thing, maam/sir""; just as it looks like guest star will get away with it, Columbo discovers piece of evidence that seals the case; Columbo nails guest star with evidence; guest star is led away to jail.  A formula, yes, but a formula that worked incredibly well for over 40 episodes in its original run.
The first season contains two of my favorites: ""Death Lends a Hand"" - Robert Culp plays a private investigator who kills a client's wife, then is hired by the unknowing client to help Columbo with the investigation; and ""Suitable for Framing"" - an art critic murders his uncle in order to obtain two priceless paintings...this episode has one of the best endings in the series.  For the possible exception of ""Lady in Waiting"", the other five episodes from the first season are also very strong.
And while details of the DVD haven't been released yet, I only hope this will also include the two rarely seen T.V. movies, ""Prescription Murder"" and ""Ransom For a Dead Man"", that introduced Lt. Columbo before it was decided to include the character in a rotation of Sunday night detective series on NBC.
These are a must for fans of detective dramas.  Thanks, Universal, for finally releasing these!",1086307200,69,1676,4.805555555555555

2076335,4,B0002COTDA,"This CD contains a half dozen  or so of the first season's episodes, all admirable presentations of the rumpled detective.  A primary nicety of having the CD is, of course, the absence of commercials throughout.  Whereas the reruns on certain TV channels contain the necessary ads, the CD doesn't;  moreover, there are no snippets missing whereby the producer has replaced with a commercial.  Yes, we know these are necessary , but the result is that a short but integral scene has been eliminated.  That is, the viewer considers these integral to the development or ""fleshing out"" of the characters or to nuances in the plot.  For example, in ""Dead Weight,"" a recent re-run did not include a scene with Suzanne Pleshette and Eddie Albert dancing romantically after a cozy dinner at Major General Hollister's home.  As the scene fades out, we are left wondering about this budding romance, with the couple in compliance with the Hollywood production code.  This is probably just as well, as we already know that Pleshette is changing her story as key witness to a murder, as she succumbs to the Major's charm.",1510012800,,1109,4.887700534759358

We binge-watched the first season of Columbo. These are some very entertaining episodes. They give the backstory of the killer and why they are doing it, then show the murder happening, then Lt. Columbo comes in and tries to solve it. He pretends to be bumbling and hassles the suspects to death in order to find what he wants. Some of my favorite episodes were Murder By the Book, Dead Weight, and Lady in Waiting.

2076366,4,B0002COTDA,"If you're fan of Peter Falk's infamous Los Angeles police lieutenant Columbo, you must watch the entire first season with all of their episodes. The first film, ""Prescription Murder,"" introduced audiences to this lovable but brilliant homicide detective. Guest cast members include Gene Barry, Nina Foch, and Katharine Justice in the pilot.

There are plenty of other guest stars in the upcoming episodes like Lee Grant, Don Ameche, Kim Hunter, Robert Culp, Leslie Nielsen, Susan Clark, Janis Paige, Forrest Tucker, Roddy McDowall, Ida Lupino, Anne Francis, Eddie Albert, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessie Royce Landis, Julie Newmar, Martin Landau in a dual role, William Windom, James Gregory, Gretchen Corbett, Jack Cassidy and others in the nine episodes.

Each episode is written and directed beautifully including one ""Murder by the Book"" by Steven Spielberg early in his career. The episodes are smart too. Unlike other mysteries, we know how and why they murder their victims. The dance between Columbo and his prime suspects are amusing and often enlightening into the person's psyche. It is both entertaining and enlightening to see Columbo try to outsmart Roddy McDowall's character in ""Short Fuse.""

Unfortunately, the DVD set does have no special features with regards to Peter Falk or the series. The series became a hit in the 1970s and ran throughout the decades. For most of us, we got to see the episodes in syndication on a weekly basis.",1476057600,,1447,5.201716738197425

2076379,5,B0002COTDA,"Quintessential late 1960s crime drama ala Perry Mason or Hawaii Five O Classic. The pilot episodes ""Prescription Murder"" and ""Ransom for a Dead Man"" set the stage for a long and successful career of Lieutenant Frank J. Columbo. There are many intentional omissions from the story line, as in the first name is never said aloud or Lt. Columbo's wife is never seen or heard. Many times , before Columbo can introduce himself , the supporting actors who have supposedly never seen him before call him by his titled name at the beginning of a scene. In every episode, a Peter Falk trademark is that somehow the Nick Nack Paddywhack song is heard or hummed or played. As Season 1 unfolds, the Columbo character gets more refined and honed, and the presentation is enhanced greatly. Falk relies often on ""Do you have a match?"" or ""Just one more thing..."" which in many instances was not in the script and ad-lib'd. Notable guest starts abound in Season 1 : Suzanne Pleshette, Eddie Albert , Jack Cassidy , Martin Milner ,  Robert Culp , Ray Milland , Patricia Crowley , Ross Martin , Susan Clark ,  Richard Anderson , among many other ""That Guy"" supporting cast actors. Steven Bochco wrote two of the first season stories ; Link and Levinson wrote two others and it is self-evident that these four stories stand out as better than the other stories because some of the events in the others not written by Bochco/Link. Levinson seem unbelievable , contrived or the running time gets away from the story line and the director has to omit some important events from the teleplay. Of the episodes in Season 1, my favorite is Death Lends a Hand guest starring Robert Culp , Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland. These time-honored actors juxtapoz Falk's character with skill and precision.  Death Lends a Hand was written by the Levinsion. Link duo and it stands out as a well orchestrated story line, easy to follow and fantastic punchline at the end, when Columbo related his mis-steps with the law as a teenage prankster using potatoes. This story is in contrast to other story lines of Season 1 not so skillfully mastered by the writers ( Suitable for Framing , Dead Weight as examples). Dead Weight is saved by the superb performances of Eddie Albert and Suzanne Pleshette. It seems the writer of Dead Weight , John T. Dugan , was stumped for good material , so we end up on Major General Hollister's yacht for what seems like twenty minutes testing the yacht's engines. In Suitable for Framing , Jackson Gillis drags the story line out and the excitement sags towards the end; but Falk pulls a rabbit out of the hat to save the episode at the end with a pair of gloves. Hope Amazon can release Season 2 and subsequent seasons on Video On Demand soon, I've bought the DVDs three times and somehow through my moves, they get misplaced. Would rather stream the shows.",1465257600,6,2855,4.649504950495049

Columbo is the finest and most entertaining series of this genre, and it has certainly stood the test of time. Although the fashions have changed, and police work has become more scientific, I prefer watching a true detective solve the crime by using his brain. Portraying an air of disorganization and incompetence, Columbo successfully lures the criminals into a false sense of superiority and security. Meanwhile, as they let their guard down, the Lieutenant skilfully ties up any loose ends and brings the hammer down when least expected. A master of the game, Peter Falk is superb and I dare say we will never see the likes of him again.

2076434,1,B0002COTDA,"re Dead Weight episode, with Albert and Pleshettte.
Silly, unbelievable. How could any adult watch this idiotic plot with this boring, stupid, gullible main character. She would even open the door and invite in a strange man--what can i do for you?she asks..... who then turns out to be the guy she reported as a murderer, who shot someone. And she goes out with him. The script is super boring, and Albert annoying after a while, and on screen too much with little to interest the viewer. I used to watch Columbo, but maybe that was in my immature youth. I guess the actors were well paid for their jobs. A hard life if they have to do this.",1417910400,,642,4.4033613445378155

2076539,5,B0002COTDA,"The unconventional sleuth who looks like ""an unmade bed"" is a joy to behold.  The thing about ""Columbo"" episodes is that they are NOT ""whodunit""'s. The criminal is known and known guilty from the start! The fun for the viewer is to look for the clues (along with Lt. Columbo) that the other investigators have overlooked.
  Five DVD's, each on their own plastic ""page"", house the nine 1971-1972 season episodes, plus two awesome prelude pilot/ earlier movies with Mr. Falk doing his thing to catch the bad guys/girls. Excellent picture and sound, and attention to detail, casting and direction-wise (one by Steven Spielberg, no less) that raise these TV shows to ( roughly) 1 hr. and 20 min. nights at the movies! Great guest stars in Season One include Gene Barry, Lee Grant, Robert Culp, and Roddy McDowell. So good, if your time schedule allows, you're sure to watch the two episodes on each of the first four DVD's back to back! Enjoy!

2076634,3,B0002COTDA,This feels like the very first one as Columbo seems too aggressive and not the character we have all grown to love over the years of the original broadcast.  Not as engaging or as enjoyable as subsequent shows.,1404432000,,210,4.526315789473684

2076642,5,B0002COTDA,"Although I've seen every Columbo episode (much more than once), watching them again is always like seeing an old friend.  This old friend tells you a story you've heard before, you know the punch line, but you are always captivated anew by the way he tells the story.  Peter Falk is the only person that could have played this role.  Although this rating is only for the first season, it would be 5 stars for every season.",1404000000,,422,4.454545454545454
2076643,5,B0002COTDA,"This series still stands alone when it comes to Detective TV shows. Peter Falk, as Lieutenant Columbia, has such a handle on his character. No over acting will be seen here.
The best part is that this series can be shared with EVERYONE in the family. There is NO gratuitous nude scene, gore, or FOUL language
The first season showcase stars of yesteryear that are just plain fun to see in their hey day",1403827200,,402,4.445945945945946
2076644,5,B0002COTDA,"Left me wishing I could get the rest of the series on Prime. Usually watching something old like this is a tad boring with all of the excitement we are used to, but not these. Columbo is a genius! Love how he makes the perp squirm everytime.",1403827200,,241,4.148936170212766

2076648,3,B0002COTDA,"This was the first season of Columbo.  I liked the series, but for the first show Columbo needed to warm up.  Apparently he developed a better character as the season  series developed.  When Peter Falk finally developed his ""raincoat"" character, it was very good.  I looked forward to the latter part of his series.",1403395200,,316,4.777777777777778

2076657,5,B0002COTDA,"I choose this rating, because the movie was well understood. There was some investigation going on about the chemical plant. I enjoyed this columbo's episode, and is a big fan of his. I would recommend it to people who watch peter falk as a movie star.",1402617600,,252,4.5
2076658,5,B0002COTDA,Columbo is obviously a savant when it comes to analyzing crime scenes and people. He (like Monk) notices details everyone else overlooks. The stories are interesting. My wife and I enjoyed watching this series we didn't have the chance to watch when it was aired in prime time.,1402617600,,277,4.791666666666667
2076659,5,B0002COTDA,"What's there to say?  It's a reverse who-dun-it mystery that works perfectly.  Some people might deride the stories because they are set in the 1970s, but honestly, why is that a factor really when other classic fictional detectives, i.e. Poirot, Marple, Holmes, etc. are set in a certain time period from long ago.  Also, Peter Falk is the key to it all.  A perfect character and mannerism that make him iconic.",1402617600,,412,4.76056338028169
2076660,4,B0002COTDA,"Believe it or not he still uses the same old coat.  He look s so much younger.  It is still worth watching his ""gotcha"" questioning.",1402617600,,132,4.24
2076661,5,B0002COTDA,I enjoyed Columbo shows on TV years ago and recently started watching them when TV had nothing interesting to offer.  Still enjoy them a lot.  Each episode is short enough to finish in a reasonable amount of time.,1402531200,,213,4.578947368421052
2076662,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo is Columbo, you either like him or you don't. I happen to like his ""dumb detective"" act, to have his detective skills underestimated...how he leads his suspects into a trap.

2076664,5,B0002COTDA,"I love the content of Columbo especially the first season. However, toward the beginning and toward the end of the Blueprint for Murder episode my copy of the disc freezes. After a while it unfreezes, but still. This copy was given to me as a present, This bothered me so much that I eventually bought another copy from Amazon. It did the exact same thing at exactly the same time in the episode. This happened a while ago but it still bothers me. I have a newer DVD player/recorder and haven't tried it out on that one yet. I wonder if anyone else has had the same problem.",1402185600,,574,4.324074074074074
2076665,5,B0002COTDA,"I enjoy watching Columbo. He is a man who is using his brain instead of only relying on computerized forensics. In each show Columbo lets the audience know his train of thought. This man is really thinking. The actors in today's cop shows are all styled models with gym bodies and the latest fashion outfits. They are basically solving their cases with iPhones and other tech gear which seems to come from SiFi shows. Thinking they do not, just looking good. Columbo is a man not concerned with his looks and what other people think of him. He is observant and computes all facts just with his brain. It is a pleasure to follow each step of his investigation.",1402012800,,659,4.546218487394958

2076667,4,B0002COTDA,"Worth a watch for the fashions of the late sixties through late seventies, Worth a watch for good writing, usually good acting, impeccable sets, and excellent casting. Columbo is iconic and you'll understand why after watching this series. Pop the corn, kick back, and enjoy time tripping. No Tardis needed.",1401667200,,307,5.16
2076668,5,B0002COTDA,Quality. Fun to make up trivia questions. Lots of familiar actpersyns you don't see much today. Amazon is pushing it by not only having mandatory minimums on the reviews but apparently some words qualify for the count and some do not.,1401667200,,234,4.7317073170731705

2076683,5,B0002COTDA,"Peter Falk inhabits the character Columbo like Raymond Burr is Perry Mason or Peter Sellers is Inspector Cleuseau.

It is great to be able to view them again!!",1401062400,,354,4.176470588235294
2076685,5,B0002COTDA,"The episodes are like small movies. You know from the beginning ""who"" did it. You wait for Columbo to prove ""how"" they did it.  He never fails to charm with his wandering stream of consciousness.",1401062400,,195,4.571428571428571

2076687,5,B0002COTDA,"Each episode has themes that are consistent with the other episodes, e.g. Smart professional accomplished people commit crimes and think they can get away with the crime. Here comes a policeman who lulls them into thinking he is a klutz. So the story line is how is Columbo going to catch them this time. Yes. He catches all of them.",1400889600,,333,4.566666666666666

2076689,5,B0002COTDA,"I don't watch much of TV's offerings these days. Not much quality there. I watched Columbo when it aired, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Now, I'm watching this excellent series again via Amazon and Apple TV. I don't remember most of the shows, so it's like watching a new series. Peter Falk was a natural for the part of Columbo, a seemingly bumbling detective, who always got the perp at the end. If you've never seen Columbo,, give it a try. I think you'll get hooked on it quickly.",1400803200,,480,4.465909090909091

2076703,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo is a quirky detective: a bit sloppy in dress, eccentric, prone to repeat himself, and annoying to the quilty.  But, you have to love him.  The way he tackles mysteries all falls into his persona.  The guilty do not think he is smart enough to solve the case and yet are annoyed by his incessant questions and returns to speak again.

This series was great in the day and has not lost any of its luster.  It is a timeless piece of craftsmanship by the team of Levinson and Link.",1400630400,,485,4.285714285714286
2076704,5,B0002COTDA,Quality television. Mystery movie series only aired every few weeks so they had time and resources to put more into the production. Fun to watch the progression of the series from the very beginning.,1400630400,,199,4.882352941176471

There will never be anyone better than Peter Falk and that rumbled rain coat and cigar!  He was just made for this role.  I particularly like the first 3 or 4 seasons before he got older and the show wasn't quite as good as the first ones.  But they all are still good and decent shows.  Alot of the episodes had you asking yourself, ""how is he going to get him/her in the end?"".  Love to curl up and watch Columbo!",1399507200,,506,4.21875

2076718,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo is a very different kind of mystery show because the audience knows who the killer is immediately.

2076726,4,B0002COTDA,Don't even try to get away with murder when Lt. Columbo is on the job. As a young adult I watched this show.  It was good then and it still is a good show to watch.  The clothes and furnishings look dated; but the storylines are great.  Columbo is so rumpled looking and unassuming that the killer always thinks he/she won't be caught.  I would recommend for those that like this type of cat & mouse entertainment. No matter how smart or how privileged they think they are; Columbo always shows them who the real Master of the Game is!,1398643200,,535,4.32

2076729,5,B0002COTDA,"The patina of age makes these made-for-tv movies all the better.  Perhaps the best feature is the talent that graced the shows, villains including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner, Jack Cassidy, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Culp, George Hamilton, John Cassavetes, Anne Baxter, Johnny Cash, Janet Leigh, and the list goes on and on.  Time has not dulled the wit of Peter Falk as the bumbling but brilliant Columbo, a seemingly lost man in a strange world but a relentless pursuer of justice, whether the villain is a pulitzer-prize willing photographer or the deputy commissioner of Los Angeles.  Prime owners, if you have an hour and a half, sit down and watch one of these episodes (I recommend Short Fuse with Roddy McDowell as a starting point), and enjoy writing for television at its finest.",1398470400,,790,4.96969696969697
2076730,5,B0002COTDA,Peter Falk was a master. We love the show and the interesting guest stars. Never a disappointment to journey with the LT through a case.,1398384000,,136,4.48
2076731,5,B0002COTDA,Yes I absolutely adore this series and no channels in NYC runs this show in syndication.  One of the reasons I went with Amazon TV is for the selection available,1398211200,,161,4.366666666666666

2076733,4,B0002COTDA,Fun to watch as I was a kid when it first aired. The 60's/70's costumes and set are a treasure in themselves but the cases are good old fashioned whodunnits without gore.,1398124800,,170,4.34375

2076736,5,B0002COTDA,These episodes are as good today or better than they were 40+ years ago.  Hard to find good cop mysteries on the network TV today.,1398038400,,130,4.2
2076737,5,B0002COTDA,I watched Columbo first run and now have every single season. I love this first season and rarely watch TV anymore due to great and entertaining TV dvds such as this.  Peter Falk IS the reason for the success.  This version is the Instant Video which I used with my Unbox.  I do have the hard dvd which has extras in it.  Don't miss this one if you like Peter Falk and mysteries.,1397952000,,379,4.1506849315068495
2076738,4,B0002COTDA,"Interesting glimpse of life/culture/technology in the late 60's.  Masterful Columbo always throws suspects off guard with his ""dumb cop"" act; browses around ""innocently"" (without warrants... he appears so dumb that he always gets away with it!) and usually sees through the perp's outer faade early in the investigation... then keeps on chipping away until the perp hangs her/himself.",1397865600,,384,5.620689655172414

2076740,5,B0002COTDA,"Rich, smug, condescending buttheads are always brought to their knees by the brilliant self-effacing Detective Columbo. Lots of delicious corny plot twists and so much more! There are the lush swanky settings from the '70's, elaborate hair-dos, make-up and clothing all looking terribly dated. There's an obsessive fascination with the uber technology of the time - ooohing over things like digital watches and telephone answering machines (we're talking old school wired to the wall dial phones with a tape-recorder attached). Lavish restaurants, top of the line sports cars, coolest sunglasses, widest lapels of the day - plus you'll catch glimpses of everyday Los Angeles in the 1970's. LOVE IT!!

The killer is always a rich, smart and powerful narcissist who makes little effort to conceal his (or her) contempt for the short, rumpled and apologetic Detective Columbo who does 1970's things like SMOKE CIGARS right inside the victims homes!!
It's fantastic!
This fare is best watched late at night when you have trouble sleeping. It is 2 hours long so you will undoubtedly doze off somewhere in the middle allowing you to spread out season one over many months of viewing.",1397779200,,1177,5.162303664921466
2076741,5,B0002COTDA,The title says it all. The shows are entertaining but we ran into technical problems with the streaming. Enough said.,1397779200,,117,4.9
2076742,5,B0002COTDA,"Those old enough to have seen an episode of Columbo during its premiere will not need convincing, but for everyone else, I challenge you to watch one or two episodes, from beginning to end, before deciding that this is an ""old show"" that only your parents or grandparents would enjoy.  Try to overlook, or heck, even enjoy making fun of the silly-looking 70's styles--and they truly ARE ridiculous looking--and concentrate on the details of the murder, always shown clearly in the beginning of the show, and the brilliant way Columbo figures it out, revealed in the end, and you may very well realize there has been a binge-worthy gem awaiting your discovery since before you were even conceived.

Note: Every episode is a stand-alone story, so no need to watch them in order.",1397779200,,776,4.827067669172933

2076745,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo came about in a time when detective shows had long before become a clich and routinely employed a predictable format. No detective show was complete without plenty of car chases, gun fights and fist fights. Columbo was always about a battle of wits between detective Columbo and some clever criminal who thought he had committed the perfect crime. Peter Faulk convincingly brought detective Columbo to life: an odd, but very likeable character, who was much smarter than he let on. This show is truly a classic.",1397520000,,519,4.977011494252873

2076748,5,B0002COTDA,"You just can't figure him out very well. Is his bumbling manner just an act? He comes across like a mannerless, unkempt idiot, yet his brilliance astounds and amuses us all! He's actually very endearing in his little habits, and who isn't familiar with his famous method of annoying the suspect to no end? Every episode is entertaining, and most of the guest stars are very accomplished. I love this show!",1397001600,,405,4.71830985915493
2076749,5,B0002COTDA,"""Columbo"" still remains a great exercise in solving a different kind of mystery.  We all know ""who done it,"" but how will the ace detective in the rumpled trench coat figure it out?  The villains are always multi-dimensional, brilliant adversaries for our intentionally annoying hero--annoying to the murderers, not to those of us watching him work through each episode's puzzle.  And the incredible list of villains ranges from Lee Grant to Patrick O'Neal.  Season 1 is just the beginning.  You will want to see them all.  On the other hand, we just pretend that ""Mrs. Columbo"" never existed. :-)",1396915200,,597,4.97979797979798

2076760,5,B0002COTDA,"Peter Falk plays the part of the intentionally obtuse detective so well that his narcissistic suspects grossly underestimate his observational and mental abilities. Of course this is just entertainment, but it is interesting to see how producers and writers have changed their focus over the past several decades. Having a good plot and developing it well through Detective Columbo has been replaced with virtual technology that often doesn't exist. But I guess if you flash enough skin, splatter enough blood or leap a car over a tall enough building, it will make up for the creativity and skill deficit that seems prevalent in current crime dramas.",1396224000,,651,5.150943396226415

I noticed one of the directors from first season was Steven Spielberg, one of the very first episodes. Lots of good guest stars. Great one with Eddie Albert and Suzanne Pleshette. Columbo, always looking for a pen to make a note. He would have lost his ipad for sure if they had them back then, but you know he would have blamed losing it on his 'wife'. I don't really think the guy could have been married, even back then. If he was, I bet she made him go to the garage to smoke the stogies.

2076808,5,B0002COTDA,"Love Columbo! Season 1 starts out with the pilot which alone is worth the purchase, it is fun to see how the character started out and how he evolved over time. Columbo is a self-deprecating, polite, quirky slob of a detective who always notices details other people miss and always asks ""Just one more question"" of the guilty party just as they think they are going to get away with it. You will recognize some of the guest stars in this season....like a young Blythe Danner who looks like a twin of her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow...and a young Martin Sheen who looks just like his son Emilio Estevez. I also love that these older shows don't have the level of violence and profanity as the shows of today. It's fun to look at that fashion and dcor from the late 60s/early 70s - what a trip man! ;)",1392940800,,797,4.391891891891892
2076809,4,B0002COTDA,"In this original pilot, all of the quirks and mannerisms that you watch for are present and if you're a fan, you will definitely want to see this one. I assume that no one who is not already a fan will ever see or read this review, so it is pointless to write more...",1392854400,,267,3.962962962962963
2076810,5,B0002COTDA,"'Classic Columbo!' Peter Falk seems to have fun with his role as the 'absent minded,' eccentric, cigar smoking detective. His first name? 'Dead Weight,' shows his LAPD ID as Frank Columbo. Look for these tid bits of information in each episode. 'Remember when' and enjoy! Not a fan? Think 'clever' and give him a chance!",1392681600,,320,4.836363636363636

2076818,5,B0002COTDA,I love Columbo. He is funny and persistent and so annoying. The intrigue is beautifully laid out and he just makes you want to see what he will do next.,1391990400,,152,4.1

2076823,5,B0002COTDA,"I have always loved Columbo and remember watching it with my Mom on late night movies! It brings back sweet memories. He is a good guy, faithful to his wife and keeps his language clean. I am of the mindset that filthy language does not enhance any movie or story. If the story is great, it will stand on its own and Columbo is proof of that! He is still appreciated years after being off the air. A great actor is what makes a successful series, not trashy mouth and sex. .",1391904000,2,474,4.163043478260869

2076825,5,B0002COTDA,Best investigator ever! Best detective series ever made. Columbo is one worthy of emulating. His principles can be applied to most any relationship.,1391904000,,148,5.478260869565218

2076827,5,B0002COTDA,"I was reminded of the genius of Peter Falk's and the Columbo shows transport you back to
The seventies. It was a simpler time and the scripts were wonderfully dependent on revealing
The true characterization of each actor. Riveting.",1391644800,,232,4.9743589743589745
2076828,5,B0002COTDA,There were two not one pilots! I've never seen before. Excellent. A tougher and leaner Columbo shows how series evolved!,1391558400,,120,5.05
2076829,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo is well written and well played. I've seen complaints from purists who have read the book(s) these stories are based upon and complain of Falk's interpretation. My entire experience with Columbo is watching the movies, shows and specials, and I love them. Falk is completely believable as the crumpled, clever detective. He plays him as a man of simple pleasures... he enjoys good food when he can get it, the company of his dog (later seasons) and often references his never-seen wife whom is frequently out of town taking care of a family member, etc. A man of little pretense, he often shows up at the crime scenes needing coffee with a hastily grabbed breakfast of a boiled egg in his pocket.

For those who have never watched, these mysteries are generally played in reverse. As the audience member you witness the criminal committing the crime first hand and are entertained as Columbo puts together the clues to find out what you already know. You get to sit back and enjoy the performance of the guests and main star as they play cat and mouse.

Amazon includes the first Columbo movie, Prescription for Murder, which is not often included as part of the first season with other streaming services. Columbo here is younger and tougher with shades of who he will become in later years.",1391472000,,1300,4.747787610619469

2076835,5,B0002COTDA,"Obviously I have fond memories of this show or I wouldn't have watched it, but I'm surprised to discover that it's even better than my memories.  Is there anything more satisfying than the look on the killers face when they discover that, contrary to their own assumptions, they are NOT the smartest person in the room?  No car chases, no fights, no action at all.  Everything depends completely on plot and the amazing Peter Falk.",1390867200,,431,4.72

2076842,4,B0002COTDA,"I enjoyed watching this when I was much younger.  Columbo always solves the murder!  He is not a slick looking inspector, but a very frumpy looking inspector, but he always gets his man.  This is fun to watch again.  I like looking at all the trappings of the 70's, the phones, the clothes, etc.  It is a period piece, but fun to watch!!",1390435200,,337,4.285714285714286
2076843,5,B0002COTDA,"I realize this classic TV series is over 40 years old. Also, I realize Columbo may be shown on TV cable networks. However, no manner how you watch this series, you will be entertained- not only by the story line and plot but also by seeing the fashion and cars from several decades ago.

If you cannot find anything to watch or you want to watch a good detective-murder mystery, log in and watch series 1.",1390435200,,405,4.328947368421052

2076848,5,B0002COTDA,"Good quality video. The show is just how I remembered it. Columbo gets the bad guy. They think they've been so smart in commiting the ""perfect crime"" and he picks it apart.",1390176000,,172,4.40625
2076849,5,B0002COTDA,One of the best TV shows ever produced. I will buy the entire set someday. I have the series on my wish list.,1390176000,,109,3.782608695652174

2076851,5,B0002COTDA,We were having a weekend of severe weather and I chose that time to do a Columbo marathon.

Sure you had your has been actors and some times a corny saying or trendy reference, however it was well written, intelligent and had very interesting plot twists and turns. It was just great!

Now the amazon prime part. The older shows seem to be on a different server and are consanlty searching, pausing and just plain stop. Newer shows and hot movies play great, the older less viewed shows are painful and most times unwatchable. thankfully the net flix version plays well and even offers more seasons.",1389830400,,612,4.666666666666667

2076870,5,B0002COTDA,"Amazing, that as much I grew up on so many great 70s shows, I did not learn about Columbo until the spring of 1998. I was a student at UNC Charlotte and my professors had allowed me to take incompletes as I was taking full-time classes and taking my father to radiation treatment 3-5 days in a 7-day period. I was alone with him when he died, and it was completely unexpected to me. So when I returned to UNCC as I still had my room in Scott Hall, A&E ran a program called Murder Mysteries and most of the time, Columbo was normally on. Immediately, I. WAS. HOOKED! School was still in session and I did not have to attend classes, MAN!!!!! What a way to spend your morning, and a guy I knew at the time, I called him and said, ""Man, there's this dude named Columbo on TV!"" He said, ""You never heard of Columbo? Columbo is old."" But he was brand-spankin' new to me, and it was the seasons of Columbo, not the movies that came after the original series. Funny, I recorded much of the shows on my TV that had a builit-in VCR! Ha! (Do they still make VCRs? And I just learned that Prime had Season 1, so this is such a treat. Whether you are new or old to Columbo, no matter how many times, you will not be disappointed. Sure, you'll wonder how he figured out some things, but that is the joy of enjoying Columbo. Press Play.",1389225600,,1322,4.147859922178989

In spite of the highly unlikely plot lines for most of the episodes, it remains entertaining to watch the crime in the opening scene and follow Columbo as he discovers the clues and follows them to the culprit.  It is interesting to look at how TV crime dramas have changed over the years and to notice all of the social conventions that have also changed since this show first aired (for instance, all of the characters who smoke).",1386892800,,521,4.360824742268041

Prescription: Murder - episode 1 is by far the best Columbo episode of them all.  Why?  It is the ONLY episode where Columbo discusses the personality and philosphy behind his character - namely, that he has turned his weaknesses into strengths (he cannot get by on looks and polish, so he disarms people by putting them at easy by appearing simple)  and why murderers are caught (they only get one shot to get it right, they are amateurs; cops are professionals).  Also, I actually liked Peter Falk in its early roles as Columbo.  In his later episodes, he character appears fake and forced (more clownish, rather than being thoughtful and realing in the criminal).

2076956,5,B0002COTDA,"I always liked Columbo and was sorry when it went off the air.  I guess the reason I liked it was it is a mixture of suspense (how does he figure out who did it?) and comedy (he is quite untradititional- in one episode he smoked cigarettes in a hospital).  Peter Falk also looks like a real nice guy, even off the screen.  What else can I say - it's not for young folks, but I bet there are plenty old folks like me that still go in for the quirky humor.",1385942400,,454,3.9130434782608696

2076976,5,B0002COTDA,"The ""Columbo"" series usually pits an  arrogant, rich, elitist against the clever, self-deprecating, everyman represented by Inspector Columbo. The rumpled, down to earth Inspector continuously points out to the murderer his/her mistakes by means of ""afterthought"" questions or comments. The TV series began in 1968 and ran for several years followed by several ""Columbo TV movies "" lasting until 2003. That is an obvious testament to the popularity of the series and Peter Falk.  Whatever your age, Peter Falk, as the razor sharp Columbo is a real treat to watch as he takes down the high and mighty in spite of their attempts to intimidate and disparage him.
Falk, who died in 2011 was a fine actor, at home in drama or comedy, who could play the most intimidating villain and the most lovable grandfather.

Columbo acts like a downtrodden detective, but is brilliant in his own way. Most of the newer shows like Psych and Monk include plenty of drama, and usually a weakness/strength for the main character. Monk calls it a blessing and a curse. In columbo, it isn't either. Columbo is a typical American guy with an average job, a below average car, and a cigar smoking habit.

2077015,3,B0002COTDA,Good 70s TV detective show. I think it was mandatory if you were an actor working in the 70s that you had to make at least one appearance on shows like this. If you were a well known movie actor but hadn't made a movie in awhile then you had to make two appearances.,1380412800,,266,3.9444444444444446

2077021,5,B0002COTDA,"I used to watch Columbo when I was just a little kid.  Decided to give it a try, now that I am all grown up.  And I realize that as a kid, I could not really appreciate the genius that is Columbo.

Peter Falk is one of a kind.  If only crime shows, now, could do a 10th of the cleverness of the show Columbo, people would not diss TV so much.  Only a couple of shows I watch now, come close to comparing to the entertainment, cleverness of writing and execution in acting of Columbo, and especially Peter Falk as Columbo.

The way he stalks the killer with his relentless ""innocent"" questions, seemingly being inquisitive when he has already figured otu from the start what happened makes me laugh at the killer's antics to try and divert suspicion.

Awesome show, I highly, highly recommend watching.",1379808000,,801,4.445205479452055
2077022,5,B0002COTDA,"When I learned that Peter Falk had died in June of 2011, I came to Amazon and purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-In-Laws-1979-HD/dp/B0090R53EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The In-Laws (1979) [HD</a>] as a kind of homage, I guess. What I was looking for at the time however, was really Columbo. I can remember back in the '70s, when we all watched TV together as a family, Sunday nights were a big TV night because of The Wonderful World of Disney, and the ABC Mystery Movie. Columbo was always my personal fave, though the others were good too. I come here once in a while and search for stuff that I'd like to get on AIV, and was delighted to see that Season One (at least) was available. While I don't remember seeing many of these particular episodes back then, I remember the feel of them. I remember the rumpled, seemingly-bumbling detective, the beautiful ladies, the handsome men. I mean, come on! Just in this first season you have Lee Grant, Jack Cassidy, Anne Francis, Roddy McDowall, Suzanne Pleshette, Martin Milner (who, according to IMDB, played Officer Pete Malloy in three different TV series in ADDITION to ADAM-12), and a very dashing Leslie Nielsen. You'll also see many excellent character actors and others who later went on to star in regular series TV. These are not generally Emmy-winning performances, just fine 90-minute mysteries with a bit of morality tale, driven by the ever-persistent undauntable Lieutenant Columbo. Uh, just one more thing -- Columbo was produced from 1968 to 2003, and I'd like to get the rest of them. I'll do it in a heartbeat when and if they become available.",1379721600,4,1665,5.125

The first time I got 15 minutes into it when I got a message on the screen saying that contact with the Amazon server had been lost. I tried to restart it using ""Resume"" but ""resume"" was not and option. A few days later I tried again. This time I got to within 3 or 4 minutes of the end, just before Columbo proved that the bad guy had done it and made the arrest, when the streaming failed again. So I never got to see exactly how he caught him. I don't think I will be streaming from Amazon ever again. I have NEVER had this problem with Netflix.",1379116800,2,707,3.9859154929577465

2077037,5,B0002COTDA,"Oh yeah, just one more thing, I'm not the only person who thought Columbo was one of greatest series on TV between 1968 and 2003. The 69 episodes are all movie-length, between 73 and 100 minutes long. The series was once broadcast on over 80 networks, spanning 44 countries. In 1997, ""Murder by the Book"" was ranked No. 16 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. And in 1999, the magazine ranked Lt. Columbo No. 7 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list. In 2012, the program was chosen as the third best cop or legal show on Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time. In 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time. In 2013, Writers Guild of America ranked it No. 57 in the list of 101 Best Written TV Series. My wife and I have watched each single episode dozens of times and we never get tired of watching the same ones over and over again. There are very few TV shows that I can say that about. And although we already own all episodes that were ever released on DVD, we still in fact enjoy watching them again when they are on broadcast TV. I just wish I could give this DVD series more than FIVE stars. Without a doubt, it is still my favorite TV series of all time. The famous guest stars also added to the show. Some of them appeared more than once. It would be truly hard to pick just one episode as my favorite Columbo episode.

2077041,5,B0002COTDA,The premier episode from 1968 is worth watching even if you're not a Columbo fan. It has so many elements from the cop movies of the time - especially Bullitt - that it's more like a movie than a TV show. Faulk also plays Columbo with more subtle intensity rather than the pseudo-comic character.,1378252800,,296,4.5

Corny or not, I love Colombo, the way he dogs the  killer & corners them in the end while putting up with their condescending and superior attitudes toward him; which is always a reuse on his part anyway with his pseudo goof act. He just let's them keep on, even slyly encouraging their overconfidence in their ability to fool him. Then he gathers all the loose ends & ties them up with it.

2077059,4,B0002COTDA,"I enjoyed it because Columbo is one of the best TV shows ever, and the character of Columbo is a great character brilliantly played by the great Peter Falk, and because the episode I watched was one of the earliest directorial assignments of Steven Spielberg. This is no instance of the genius leaping off the screen and you can just see the great director Spielberg would become because it's just so obvious or anything.  It is a highly competent piece of commercial episodic TV made by a talented young man (I think he was under 25) learning his craft and showing a very strong grasp of how to make a studio-acceptable product.  It is interesting because it doesn't really foreshadow the themes or technical qualities or emotional resonances we now associate with Spielberg's work - it is the work of a novice who is learning swiftly how to operate within the studio system.  To contrast it with ""Lincoln"" is striking.",1376438400,,920,4.7375

Many are good and many are ""classic"" and well remembered, but most shows were products of their time.
And when that time has passed, successive generations find it harder and harder to relate to it.
Columbo is an example of a ""timeless"" show.  Though definitely set in the early 1970s, the acting, the story lines, the character interactions are as relevant today as they were when first aired.

It's simply a mystery and it's not only Columbo vs. the Criminal, it's Columbo vs. you! I love trying to figure out that damning piece of proof that Columbo needs before he reveals it and I love watching the criminals trip themselves up. The acting is superb from all parties of actors in the show, but Peter Falk managed to make someone who should've been a hardened detective into a lovable, bumbling, ""This Old Man"" whistling genius with a penchant for seeming like an idiot while revealing that he's actually calculating just how to nail the murderer.

2077077,5,B0002COTDA,"Unlike most mystery series where you don't know who did it until the very end, Columbo mysteries always show the crime from the beginning,  Columbo always suspects the real culprit and the intrigue of this series lies in how Columbo is going to prove what always seems to be a perfect crime.",1375056000,,291,4.596153846153846

2077089,5,B0002COTDA,There were a couple of episodes that were a bit boring but the rest of the season made up for it.  It was a real treat to see so many of the old 'movie stars' of yesteryear.  I very much enjoyed watching this series.  Peter Falk was amazing as Columbo.,1374624000,,252,4.0
2077090,4,B0002COTDA,I love Peter Falk as the bumbling Columbo in the wrinkly trench coat solving mysteries.  Way cooler than today's who dunit's.,1374451200,,125,4.9523809523809526

2077092,3,B0002COTDA,"So, I like Columbo (or so I thought) I am watching season 1 and, so far, it is just passable.  I is really slow to get to a point and I guess things will get better.  It could be that I am older and expect more than TV used to provide.  I know that things will get better so let me get back to watching season 1 and move on to season 2.",1374364800,,336,3.5753424657534247

2077095,5,B0002COTDA,I've watched through the Columbo series several times. I enjoy watching the earliest (season one) shows and seeing the development of the character into what became the best US cop and cop show ever made.,1374105600,,204,4.857142857142857

2077102,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo always homes in on the right person no matter how well they have concealed their murder.  It's a game of cat and mouse as Columbo uncovers minute clues.  It's fun to watch as the guilty person first dismisses him as incompetent and then becomes increasing annoyed as they realize he is investigating them.

It's also pretty funny to look at how the sets were decorated in the early 1970's, shag carpet and all.  Enjoy.",1373760000,,426,4.64
2077103,5,B0002COTDA,I enjoyed watching this series when it was originally aired and enjoy watching them just as much as reruns. Good show,1373673600,,117,4.619047619047619
2077104,5,B0002COTDA,The earliest episodes really played up the dichotomy of the fumbling yet very methodical Lt. Columbo. I enjoy seeing him being offbeat but always himself. There is steel underneath the formal manners. Love the first season.,1373587200,,223,5.222222222222222

2077106,5,B0002COTDA,"I loved the first season of Columbo. The Amazon set starts with the first 2 movies: Prescription Murder and 'Ransom  for a Dead Man' . Both are simply excellent. Then it leads to the actual first season starting with ""Deadline Murder"" (I think that's the title, not sure). It's the episode directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Stephen Bochco. As you would expect, it's well plotted and shot and it introduces you to Jack Cassidy as the murderer. The first of his many appearances.
  It amazes me how good some of these old mysteries are. Columbo will always be my favorite. Underneath the rumpled, dumb looking demeanor, Columbo is really a genius who knows who the murderer is within minutes of his investigation, he just has to put the facts and evidence together. I highly recommend it.",1373241600,,796,4.753623188405797
2077107,4,B0002COTDA,The quality of the show is excellent but episodes are missing.  It is not a complete season by any means.,1373155200,,105,4.25
2077108,5,B0002COTDA,I am starting to watch all the shows from the beginning and it is just wonderful. I enjoy seeing the character actors in the early stages of their careers. There is really nothing new to say about Peter Falk except he totally embodied this role. The scripts were crisp and taut. So glad I can take the time to watch the episodes uninterrupted.,1372982400,,343,4.4603174603174605
2077109,5,B0002COTDA,"You've got to love Columbo. This is my go to comfort food of video. I'm never disappointed. All season and all episodes are great.

2077110,5,B0002COTDA,A great show. Columbo is the best. I enjoy shows with less violence and more brain work! It would be great if you had the movies from the later years of Columbo on instant too.,1372982400,,176,4.057142857142857

2077117,5,B0002COTDA,"It was a kick to see Peter Falk in the first episode.  He (they all) looked so young.  You could see how he had developed the character over the succeeding seasons.  Columbo wasn't as much of a pain, initially, as he was in later episodes.  Nor, was he as ""rumpled"" and, of course, his Panhard came later.  But, it was fun to watch the opening bell and, since we don't really remember all of the individual episodes, we look forward to watching them unfold again.",1372118400,,463,4.4

2077121,5,B0002COTDA,"I'm a fan of crime/detective shows. Watching this show after all these years I'm pleased that it still is just as good as ever. Peter Falk's portrayal of the rather shabby dressed, cigar smoking,Columbo is great. Columbo appears to be something of a bumbler, but he's really quite shrewd. He makes himself something of a pest to the person he knows is probably the guilty party, coming back to ask questions over and over again. And then there's that car...and the basset hound. And always references to the never seen Mrs. Columbo. Plus the added bonus of nostalgia, seeing ""guest stars"" from the era.",1371772800,,602,4.798076923076923

The clothes and hair may be dated, but the cat and mouse as Columbo asks his ""one more thing"" still crackles with great dialogue high on tension and humor. Peter Faulk is excellent as the unorthodox detective who may seem disorganized but has a mind that picks up on every little ""loose end"".

More current homicide detectives with personalities are homages to Peter Falk's ""Columbo"", specifically ""Monk"" and ""The Mentalist"".

Excellent acting by Peter Falk and by the actors playing the villians, Lee Grant, Robert Culp, Edward Arnold.  Culp especially is so self assured and superior, the interaction between him and Falk are quite funny. Lee Grant was scary as a woman who killed her husband - because he was too nice.

I rather expected to be board since I have seen almost all of the episodes already but I thought; ""what the heck"".  I was surprised, like all great movies or TV shows you can watch them over and over and get someting out of it that you didn't see before.  That was my experience watching Columbo.

2077174,5,B0002COTDA,"I'm a huge Columbo fan from way back, glad to see it's available in streaming video.  For the HD version, however, I do get a lot of pixel breakdowns; it doesn't happen often and not too large an area but it does happen.  Other than that, no problems at all.  If you like to see how cases are solved the old fashioned way (you don't see a lot of the behind-the-scenes work, i.e. forensics, ballistics, etc like you do on NCIS or CSI) just using the gray matter, I think you'll like Columbo.",1366761600,,490,4.247311827956989

2077185,5,B0002COTDA,"What can I say? Peter Falk as Columbo rivals all the great detectives in history, topped by Holmes and Marple... not bad for a rumpled guy from Brooklyn who manages to focus on the one tiny inconsistency which points him in the right direction of a suspect who always think they're smarter than the cops. Unless they have the misfortune of having Columbo on the case, they're usually right. The evolution of the character is inventively brilliant, starting with the premise: the audience knows who the killer is and how they did it. The trick is getting Columbo to come up with an irrefutable twist which seals the murderer's fate. Brilliant from the first moment to the last. With all the remakes on movies and TV, when will we see a Columbo 2.0? Possibly... never. Simply because, it most likely can't be done.
Elementary, Watson! (Oh and, just one more thing...)",1365033600,,865,4.735099337748345

2077189,5,B0002COTDA,"Recommend to basically adult viewers, or mature young adults.  There isn't any nudity or profanity in this set, but the subject matter of murder and the premeditating of murder, isn't suitable for children.  Over all, a very good series - Columbo's BEST!  The color and clarity, and sound were all terrific!",1364947200,,307,4.980392156862745
2077190,5,B0002COTDA,"This Season 1 Columbo collection is essential viewing for fans of the show. It contains the original TV Movie Prescription: Murder, based upon the stage play that created the character, and the second TV pilot, Ransom for a Dead Man, which sets the tone for the series to follow.

For Columbo fans, this collection shows how the original stage play was shaped into a winning formula for episodic television. All the Season 1 episodes are good, and some are amongst the best of the series. It's great to see these episodes in HD quality, and the transfers are excellent. I wish Amazon would provide the entire series, but this is a fine way to see how things got started. Falk is top notch thoroughout, and I think his high level performances bring out the best in the other performers. Perhaps the greatest detective show that ever was.",1364601600,,836,4.687074829931973

2077192,5,B0002COTDA,He only appears to be a bumbling detective.  I remember watching these way back when.  Columbo always figures out whodunnit.  No unsolved cases when Columbo is around.  It's fun to see the various famous guest stars.,1364515200,,216,4.916666666666667

2077194,5,B0002COTDA,I bought this as a gift for my mother. I ended up watching a few episodes with her and I was hooked. I love this guy.

2077210,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo fans will enjoy watching this first series and noticing how Columbo evolved from a more intense detective into the laid-back pseudo-bumbler that he is known for. Although there are traits that carried him through the years; the courteous, seemingly inept, omnipresent pest, Columbo's first season is a lesson in how characters eventually develop into themselves. Can't help but love it.",1363046400,,394,5.475409836065574

I have seen them all, once in a while there may be an episode that is not as good as most. But about every 3 years or so, I go thru all of the episodes again and they are just as entertaining as when first watched. The fact that it is ""dated""...the best shows were from the early to mid 70's, ads some entertainment value. It's cool to see early versions of telephone answering machines, security systems and even VCR's. good stuff, good show. Peter Falk is perfect in this role.",1362873600,,578,4.216216216216216

2077215,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo is just good old fashioned entertainment. It's not trying to make a political statement and it's not that silly, fake reality stuff.

2077225,5,B0002COTDA,"I have always loved detective stories...and Columbo has a special feature and it is that they show you who the criminal is at the very beginning of the show. Then the whole show goes following Columbo with his questioning techniques and goofy behavior trying to prove who did it. I love other detectives, but Columbo has a special appeal for me maybe because for starters he does not look like a detective at all: his car, his clothes, his never seen wife--in the show per se...in the third season they included a pilot for Mrs. Columbo...but she was never seen in his show--and of course his adorable dog. I think that this particular characteristic of not resembling at all what he does for a living is what takes the criminals off guard...they think they will outsmart him with their intricate plots...but he is the one who laughs at the end.",1361836800,,845,4.64

It was great to see a young and skinny Peter Falk and see how the character evolved from Peter Falk's original incarnation. We see with the first episode that Columbo has already developed his style of a bumbling detective trying to catch the criminal off guard. What would be great if someone could make, in honor of Peter Falk, new episodes of a young Columbo to see how he developed his skills. What about it, Jeff Bezos?  How about some original programming?",1360540800,,528,4.67741935483871

2077257,5,B0002COTDA,"From the opening credits to the finish, it is clear that THIS is the reason why Columbo began with such a following.  Those of you who are familiar with pop psychology will recognize the R-test that is the graphic motif for the opening credits and from there the treats begin.  There are moments that the acting has the feel of that ""over-acting"" from that era of film/TV and certainly no modern crime unit would allow Columbo to take the liberties he does in these earlier episodes. Still the methodical, insightful investigation and the plot twists makes this a first-rate detective episode.

2077271,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo is one of television most enduring characters. With his scruffy hair, raincoat, and cigar he is an unforgettable character. Columbo uses these traits successfully against the criminals he encounters. Initially, his somewhat unkempt appearances along with his ridiculously shabby car give his opponents the impression that he is not much of a threat.  However, as the classic adage goes, don't judge a book by its cover. Unlike many other detective series Columbo reveals the perpetrator of the crime at the beginning of the show. The fun is watching Columbo pick apart the clues and gradually break down his opponents. Columbo usually starts out complimentary towards his rivals, especially if they are a famous celebrity. To put the criminal off guard Columbo usually will say something like, ""my wife is a big fan of yours"". This usually makes the criminal less threatened by Columbo. However, as the show progresses Columbo can become increasingly more aggressive and points out clues to the perpetrator, never really telling them if they are guilty. This makes the guilty increasingly annoyed and alas complacent.  Columbo really is the master of psychological warfare.  By the end of the show Columbo has one final clue, that the viewer usually misses, and which ultimately seals the case.

With other detective shows so reliant on car chases and gun play Columbo was and is a refreshing escape. What is surprising is that there really has never been a rival to Columbo since it first aired in the late sixties. Maybe Monk was another eccentric detective that rivals Columbo, but the plots to that show tended to be more outlandish. What made Columbo special was it was more grounded in reality, and the plots never seemed implausible. This may explain why Columbo has stood the test of time.",1339632000,2,1805,5.046979865771812

2077273,5,B0002COTDA,"Even though I know that we will be shown the murder at the beginning so that the only mystery we have is what clues Columbo will find most useful, I still keep coming back, episode after episode.  The unkempt detective who is always underestimated and sometimes despised is so endearing that he carries the same old storyline through more than 7 seasons and is still not enough.  Though we know who-done-it from the beginning, we are always on the edge of our seat waiting for that moment when the hero reveals he knew even before we did.  The perfect balance of subtle comedy and tense drama makes this a classic in television.",1336003200,,628,4.589285714285714

2077284,5,B0002COTDA,"What I especially loved about this boxed set is the first episode entitled ""Prescription:  Murder"" as we see a very young (and brash) Lt. Columbo.  I particularly enjoyed the scene where he visits the paramour of Gene Barry's character and starts ranting that she's the weak link in the case and he will break her, even if he has to follow her every single day.  I wish there had been more of that behavior by Lt. Columbo because as time went on, he became way too nice and overly polite with the ""Yes, sirs.""  In fact, by the end of the series, he became a caricature of himself.  How many times did other police officers not know who Lt. Columbo was, only to mistake him for either a homeless man or a derelict trying to drive his car near the crime scene?  Don't get me wrong:  I love the Columbo series and from time to time re-watch it from Season One to the last boxed set.  And towards the end of the series, Peter Falk's wife (Shera Danese) appeared in too many episodes.  The woman can't act her way out of a paper bag, but as wife of the star and one of the executive producers, I'm sure it was a case of ""happy wife equals happy life"" and Peter Falk relented just to keep peace.

The other episodes of Season One are stellar.  This was a phenomenal TV show and it never gets old.  Kind of reminds me of the classics (The Honeymooners, I Love Lucy, etc.) where you can watch an episode a thousand times and enjoy it as if you were seeing it for the first time.",1329955200,,1470,4.210714285714285

I know this is out of Amazon's responsibility, but they kindly have offered to let me return the whole set (the others were fine) for a refund.

This series of Columbo shows still retain much of the original interest and avoids looking too dated; admittedly some of the shows are a bit more inclined to show their age than others but by and large the shows in this series have held up well, continue to create and sustain interest.

That is saying something about the quality of acting, writing and producing when it can withstand the test of time as well as these shows have done.

2077312,5,B0002COTDA,"In most murder mysteries, it is a mystery of who did it, how it was done, and why.  In the Columbo series we know the who, the how, and the why; so what is the mystery?

Most Columbo episodes begin with a coldly intelligent murderer carefully laying out in meticulous detail their scheme for murder, while at the same time, providing themselves a cleverly arranged alibi at the apparent time of their victim's demise.  The mystery is, how is Columbo going to solve these perfectly crafted murders?

If you are the murderer, you are probably arrogant and are ready to dismiss Columbo as just a bumbling policeman; nothing to worry about.  But after your first encounter with this short and somewhat comical detective, you suddenly realize that Columbo has just spotted something: a minor, insignificant flaw in your perfect plan.

Before you know it, Columbo begins finding more and more little things that just don't add up.  And those loose ends that Columbo needs to tie-up, turn out to be your shoelaces.  Desperately, you try to out-maneuver this pest of a detective, but he just won't leave you alone.  Columbo spirals in tighter and tighter like a noose around your neck.

Just when you think you can't stand the pressure anymore, it appears his evidence is just not solid enough; you got away with it!  And that little detective thinks he's so smart!  You let your guard down: he's gotcha!

If you are a Columbo fan and have never seen the first season, you will be pleased to know, all of these shows are as great as the later Columbo shows.

Picture (DVD): good to excellent.",1271030400,4,1584,4.692028985507246
2077323,5,B0002COTDA,"Columbo was an entertaining show, completely dominated by Peter Falk as the title character.  It was the ultimate formula show.  Very early in each episode someone gets bumped off.  Columbo arrives on the scene in his beat up old car, uncombed hair, unshaven face, crouched over posture, disgusting chewed up cigar and looking like he just woke up.  He quickly seems to figure out who committed the crime and hounds that person w/ questions and unwelcome visits until he's able to evoke a confession or express his own air tight conclusions based on all the facts that he's gathered.  The problem w/ the character of Columbo is that he's such an absent-minded shmuck that it's implausible that he'd be such a brilliant detective.  He never has a pen or pencil, always seems to be in his own world, drives a hunk of junk and seems to lack a first name.  An entertaining show, but Columbo's really a cartoon character....",1267142400,,919,4.7421383647798745
2077324,5,B0002COTDA,"I'm a sucker for 70's and 80's tv.  I tire of the edgy violence and crude humor of today's tv.  Columbo is something even my kids like to watch.  They don't show the crime (murder) like they do today.  Columbo is unique in that you get to see who done it, why, and how at the beginning.  The fun is watching Columbo piece it together.

2077329,2,B0002COTDA,"A word of warning for the French speaking communities in Canada: the quality of the French translation here in the subtitles, for most of the episodes, is utterly shameful, and I would urge Quebec consumers to register a complaint about it to the Office de la langue franaise. Not only did these ""translators"" have the level of language completely wrong in places, but it is infested with typographical and grammatical errors of elementary school level!

A direct transcription of the generally excellent dubbing they did in France in the 70s would have been the way to go to give justice in French to this landmark detective series.

...Also, a bit of print restoration would not have hurt, especially given the regular price these boxes sell for!

...No extras!

...Finally, the scenes division in FOUR (!) chapters only is entirely frustrating when one wants to catch up on viewing!

...But yes, this is still some of the best of the best, when the series could have its moments of romanticism, drama and mystery all at once. When, as a recent reviewer aptly stressed, Peter Falk could actually be taken seriously by the murderer in a progressively suspenseful way, instead of only at the finale, after sometimes interminable displays of ineptness and goofing, like in some of those unwatchable 80s/90s episodes.

And don't miss the lost musical gem which is the ""Columbo"" theme (NOT the Henry Mancini theme for the ""Sunday Night Mystery Movie"") by Gil Melle, in the episodes entitled ""Short Fuse"", ""Death Lends A Hand"", ""Dead Weight"" and ""Blueprint For Murder"". This theme will sadly be discarded forever by the studio as of Season 2. Plus his original episode score for ""Short Fuse"" is simply phenomenal!",1252022400,7,1709,4.958041958041958
2077330,5,B0002COTDA,"It's kind of difficult to write a review of the Columbo series. Pretty much everyone is familiar with it already. If you don't know who Columbo is , or you never heard of him, you're probably living in Madagascar. ( the country... not the movie...).  But , as Columbo might say... ""if I could have just a minute of your time sir..."".  I'll give it a try.  Lieutenant Columbo, homicide detective of the Los Angeles Police force, would never be mistaken for that.  He dresses like a construction site manager who just stepped out of the local bar after a business lunch with his boss. One of the always-funny running jokes in the Columbo series is how many people mistake him for a vagrant or a passer-by who happened to wander into the scene of a police investigation. He's always having to pull his badge out to convince people that he belongs there. Plain-clothes indeed. There was one particularly humorous episode where his ( forever unseen...) wife got him a present of a new deep blue ( or possibly black ) trench coat to replace that rumpled old saggy bleak-beige one he typically wears.  He kept carrying the new one around, sometimes putting it on... but mostly carrying it because he just couldn't stand the feel of it, but he didn't want to disappoint his wife, so kept trying to ""accidentally"" leave it somewhere where it might get stolen.  No luck.  By the end of the episode he's forsaken the new one and is back to the tired old saggy trench coat that he loves.  There are little things like that which keep a continuity between each movie or episode ( whatever you prefer to call them...) that make Columbo feel like a quirky family relation who you enjoy seeing.  Columbo doesn't carry a gun. He made that clear, quietly, to a friend of his on the force who he paid 5 dollars to, to take his target training practice for him. ( Columbo claimed that he couldn't hit the target anyway) He was being pestered by Internal Affairs to complete his required target practice.  Again here we see that he is not a typical detective. Columbo does not grill his suspects like you might see on other police dramas or investigations.  He doesn't take them to the station and sit them in an interrogation room and give them the third degree.  In fact he is so polite, makes such a small presence of himself, is so ingratiating..., that he throws his suspects off guard. This is his well developed approach. By presenting himself as an amiable naive klutzy gumshoe detective who seems to want to be everyone's best friend, he completely disarms his suspects of any worry that he might be gradually sneaking up on them , putting clues together, and figuring out what they thought was the perfect crime. This is really the primary enjoyment of the series.  Watching Columbo in his very average looking getup, slowly, but very very persistently piece together who committed the homicide and how they did it. For Columbo, his deliberate deceptively clunky and awkward manner masks his very sharp mind and very astute eyes that don't overlook anything that might be important. And at the end of each movie or episode, we are treated to the stunned look on the murderer's face as he or she suddenly realizes that Columbo pulled one over on them and was a lot smarter than they gave him credit for.  Peter Falk has the character of Columbo nailed down to perfection. He has created an icon for all ages.  Rarely does an actor develop a character to such a fine degree that the character becomes part of our cultural background, but Columbo will be with us for as long as we have media on which to watch these great crime dramas. Columbo is unique in the cannon of detective characters, a man who even the criminals can't help but find endearing as he saunters around like your next door neighbor , a neighbor who also happens to suspect you of committing murder.  The disks are in excellent condition and perform very well for both audio and visuals.  You should buy this series. It doesn't matter if you like police drama or not, it doesn't matter if you like murder mysteries or not.  You will love this. Columbo is one series you just don't want to miss.

2077364,5,B0002COTDA,"I have always liked Columbo, but being a bit too young to have enjoyed it as a series on TV, I really didn't considered myself a fan.  Sure, I had seen him on some of his numerous movies made later on, and was familiar with his dry sense of humor.  When I rented this series, however, I was not expecting it to be so good.

The budget on these shows must have been high, and I would really consider them movies, especially the first couple of episodes.  Prescription for Murder was a very classy show as was Ransom for a Dead Man.  As the series progressed, you could see a visual change, a reduction in budget, some repainted scenes, but overall, the shows were excellent, and all very classy, especially considering the time period.

I really find it amazing to watch a detective show, where the opening scene is seeing someone committ a murder, and then trying to see how the detective solves it.  I mean, the concept seems weak, it seems like it would be easy to solve it, but there are always some very interesting twists in the investigation that makes it more interesting.  Sometimes, it seems a bit unrealistic that Columbo bites on the perpetrator right away, and sometimes the deductive logic has gaps.  Still, there are times when crime scene investigation techniques seem lacking, even for the time period (like not checking for fingerprints).  Yet these indiscrepancies are rare, and take some careful viewing to find.  Overall, the stories feel intellegent, and while the detective work is based largely on evidence, keen observations and the occasional hunch seems to give Columbo an edge.

Overall, the series has its faults, but it is a real gem just waiting to be rediscovered.  You'll find that the premises are not too dated, nor are too many plot devices irrelevant (few things hinge on not having a cell phone, etc).

Peter Faulk is an amazing talent, and even though the price seems high, this season is a real gem.",1239148800,2,1938,4.678466076696165

Peter Falk is wonderful in the role and I especially enjoyed discovering the early Columbo movies.  The 60s setting to the first Columbo movie adds pizazz and spunk as well as a younger cuter Peter Falk.  The Lee Grant 1971 movie is an opportunity for Peter Falk and Lee Grant to have a great time acting with one another.  This movie has a lot of grit and acting bravado.

2077391,5,B0002COTDA,"Peter Falk first played Lt. Columbo in the 1968 made for television movie ""Prescription: Murder"" in which he squared-off against Gene Barry's wife murdering psychiatrist. According to Katharine Sharp in her book, ""Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood,"" the movie was the highest rated program of the week when it aired on NBC. The network wanted a series, but Falk balked, not wishing to commit himself to a weekly hour show especially since the Columbo format relied on how the detective trapped his prey and its entertainment value was dependent on the interchange between the detective and the culprit. It might have been too clever to remain fresh and exciting when 22 to 24 episodes were produced each year.

Three years later, however, Falk changed his mind when Universal and NBC proposed the Mystery Movie format. Instead of airing weekly, ""Columbo"" would rotate with two other series, ""McCloud"" and ""McMillan and Wife,"" in one 90 minute time slot. A second movie, ""Ransom for a Dead Man,"" aired to strong ratings in early 1971, and the series kicked off in September of that year, becoming an immediate hit.

The two pilot films are included, along with all seven of the first season's episodes, in Universal's five DVD set, Columbo: The Complete First Season. The original film remains as strong as I remembered it upon first viewing way back in `68, as well as when it was repeated in the `90s on ABC which had revived ""Columbo"" for a highly rated but far less memorable run. Falk is more hard-edged in the first film, not yet having given Columbo the warm puppy-dog quality that endeared the character to millions. He loses his temper when interrogating Katherine Justice, the lovely young psychiatric patient who is an accessory to Barry's crime. In most of the episodes to follow, Falk rarely lost his cool, disarming the killers with his friendly, often outwardly befuddled demeanor.

""Death Lends a Hand,"" the first episode produced for the series but the second to air (network brass thought ""Murder by the Book,"" a Steven Spielberg directed show, was stronger, but I disagree), finds Columbo fully formed. He amuses Robert Culp's private investigator who is unaware that the detective wants to read his palm only to see if he's wearing the kind of sharp ring that left a mark on the victim. Culp's amusement doesn't last long, though, as Columbo calmly and carefully sets the trap that will reveal his guilt. The contrast between Falk and Culp makes this one of the strongest episodes, and it's no surprise that the former star of ""I Spy"" would be invited back twice in the following seasons to match wits with the detective. Falk is calm, friendly, amusing, and disheveled. Culp is cool, even cold, condescending, and well-tailored.

""Dead Weight,"" the first season's third episode, is less memorable, but goes down well due to the casting of Eddie Albert as a highly decorated general patterned on George Patton, the subject of a popular and Oscar winning movie the previous year. Albert cuts an impressive figure and is such a good actor that he easily shakes off memories of Oliver Douglas, the hapless hero of the long running sitcom ""Green Acres."" There's a glint in his eye that conveys as much menace as charm. Suzanne Pleshette is delightful as the uncertain witness to his crime. Even Timothy Carey, a frequent villain on the big screen, shows up as the proprietor of the diner where Columbo eats the first of many bowls of chili he would enjoy in the series.

Other highlights include ""Short Fuse"" with Roddy McDowall, and ""Suitable for Framing"" with Ross Martin (Artemis Gordon from ""The Wild, Wild West""), but each of the seven episodes (nine if you count the two pilots) are worthwhile and enjoyable. The only drawback to this set is the lack of any extras. A show as long-lived, as well as both critically and popularly acclaimed, deserves a documentary or two that provides background on the character and his development. For instance, is it true that the role of Columbo was first offered to Bing Crosby?

Columbo was definitely unique in concept and went beyond very well done, it was outstanding.  Peter Falk was superb as Columbo and deserved the Emmy awards he received for this role, but each episode was also very well written and directed and the guest stars were consistently outstanding.

Columbo often works on hunches and by the end of each episode he has enough evidence for an arrest. It's not as flashy as any of today's criminal investigation shows but the characters and story lines are still great. What really adds to the entertainment value though is that this shabby (and sometimes dopey) looking detective's suspect is often someone who drives a fancy car and comes from the high end of society.

In front of the camera, there are guest stars such as Leslie Nielsen and Robert Culp (who also appears in season 2), while behind the camera are legendary names such as Steven Spielberg and Steven Bochco. All of this adds up to a great first season with few weak moments. Must also add that the quality of the picture transfer to DVD is great. The early 70s colours are just fantastic.

There are no special features included with this set but as I bought the region 4 edition of season one, I do get to see and hear the original Universal MCA-TV title at the end of the closing credits for each episode.

His performance is apparently casual, so effortless and yet it's hard to take your eyes off him. He has animal magnetism and great charm, and a presence which seems to fill the room. I am sure other actors watch him just to see how he does it. You always see the criminal commit the crime at the beginning of each show, and you see Columbo latch onto them (usually at first meeting) and watch his skilful deduction as he waves his cigars, squints through the smoke, stalls his car, spills his matches, loses his pens and drops his clangers.

2077453,4,B0002COTDA,"How can you not love Columbo, the disarming detective with the absent-minded demeanor who unnerves heinous murderers from their ivory towers?  The first season probably deserves five stars for its innovation and development.  The pilot movie delighted audiences with its surprises and characterization.  There are skillful performances throughout and interesting cases to boot.  One could find minor qualms almost from the series' success and continuing improvement.  There are a few episodes that bring a cliff-hanger and depend on Columbo's assumptions of human nature to unravel their crimes.  They aren't always coincidences, but chance plays into Columbo's hand a little too neatly sometimes.

Despite this picky complaint, the crimes presented seem flawless by those living the lifestyles of the rich and arrogant, and it Columbo's finesse as a man with everyman's savy that has delighted audiences for decades.  He's still the TV detective to beat.  (Leslie Nielsen [playing it straight--no less!] Jack Cassidy, Lee Grant, and Ross Martin are just a few of the guest cast who make the adventures authentic.  Roddy McDowell, subjectively, is the smoothest murderer of the bunch.)  The debut season is a good start to a great television series.",1156032000,5,1249,5.453125

Columbo was one of the few shows, where the story quality rarely degenerated from one season to the next. That said, however, it's nothing short of criminal that several of these episodes are NOT in their original full length. From the first season DVD set, actress Barbara Rhodes is missing from ""A Lady In Waiting"". Even worse, a key scene in a recording studio with Columbo and an engineer is missing from the famous ""Swan Song"" episode with Johnny Cash, from the second or third season. And I've found large scene deletions in at least two other favorite episodes on other season DVDs. These shameful practices are characteristic of most American conglomerates like GE-NBC-Universal that consistently show that their regard for their customers is even lower than that of their own substandard merchandise.

After the third episode of the first season (""Murder by the Book,"" directed by Steven Spielberg), I was sure that the show is going to be one of my favorites.

My initial hesitation had to do with the fact that the show is from more than 30 years ago. I don't know why I keep forgetting that, while the outside of our lives may change tremendously, the inside change little. I just assumed that the show would be too ""coy"" for the tastes of today's viewers, and, without blood, without profanity, without overt violence, murder mysteries wouldn't have so much thrill and fun.

2077496,4,B0002COTDA,"These shows are not mysteries.  Since the viewers get to watch the crime happen and Columbo is almost always zeroed in on the killer right away, there's no ""whodunnit"" suspense.  Nor is there intended to be.

So why is it such a great series?  That's hard to define.  Of course, there's Peter Falk as Columbo.  He's a likable actor playing a likable character, a detective who isn't nearly as bumbling as he pretends, but still isn't the least bit hard-boiled.  In any of these episodes, Columbo isn't so much the star as one of a strong ensemble cast.  And those casts are another remarkable feat.  The acting in any episode of this show is always first rate.

The other strong point is the writing.  While these aren't mysteries, they do somehow keep you interested.  The dialogue is sharp, and you're never quite sure what Columbo is up to.  In a way, these are reverse mysteries.  Instead of wondering who did it, we find ourselves wondering how he'll solve it.  Rarely, are we disappointed.

Columbo doesn't have car chases or gun fights or even harsh language.  And even the murders are usually implied violence.  It just has people standing around talking, engaging characters, relaxed (rarely dull) pacing.  It's just Columbo, but for whatever reason, it works.",1119225600,5,1269,4.818604651162791

Peter Falk is smarter than The Funny Little Man on Law & Order: Criminal Intent, and nearly as funny as Inspector Cleuseau, without being as slapstick.  Think of this show as the ""Proto-Monk"".

In the 70's, TV shows moved at a slower pace, taking the time required to tell a story.  There isn't a laugh track, or a punch line delivered every 15 seconds in Columbo.

I personally find this DVD lacking in terms of extra features, but the episodes themselves are reproduced in a high quality format with excellent sound.  I'd say it's in better shape than the film prints they used to show whan the series was in re-runs all those years.",1116892800,2,739,4.689922480620155
2077498,5,B0002COTDA,"Many successful television series start out slowly and then reach their peak after several episodes or in a second season.

This is not the case with Columbo.  As you can see already in the original movie ""Prescription: Murder"" (which was NOT the pilot, ""Ransom for a Dead Man"", was), Peter Falk and the writers already had the character down pat:, the references to the wife, the need to look for a pencil, the rumpled look, the modest demeanor, etc (actually the old Peugeot 403 convertible hasn't yet made it appearance!).  An earlier reviewer states that ""Prescription: Murder"" is unusual because Columbo gets angry in it, but it should be pointed out that he gets angry in later episodes as well, such as ""Stich in Crime"" and ""Exercise in Fatality"". The actual pilot ""Ransom for a Dead Man"" is one the most outstanding episodes of them all, and here we see the first story in which ""high-technology"" or some other speciality comes into the story, in this case, aviation and automatic telephones.  Lee Grant is outstanding as the seductive, yet poisonous murderer of her well-meaning husband.  Jack Cassidy makes his debut in the first regular season episode(""Murder by the Book"") as a writer.  He was one of the best of the murderers and ended up appearing in three episodes. The young Steven Spielberg directed this episode in a very unique way (note the unusual camera angles and lighting). These are the best of the first season.  A couple of the episodes (""Dead Weight"" with Eddie Albert and ""Lady in Waiting"" with Susan Clark) are not as good as the others, but on the whole, it is worth seeing all of them.

Actually, unlike most multi-year series which tend to run out of steam, some of the best episodes are in the later seasons so I hope all the seaons will eventually appear on DVD.",1115769600,6,1797,4.718849840255591
2077499,5,B0002COTDA,"Possibly my favorite TV show of all time! As an artist, my personal favorite episode has to be 'Suitable for Framing', which was the first time I had seen a body kept warm with an electric blanket to conceal the time of death, and the coolest, most ingenious conclusion of the entire series! The haunting music of the original series, a ghostly violin and an echo of typewriter, as if from the author as he composed the story, was awesome!

I would love to see a slew of special features included, but considering the average price of a TV show season pushes $60-$100, I'm satisfied to have the shows stand alone. More often than not, the features only bare a single viewing, or aren't that special; the stars have moved on with their lives and reveal little of real interest.

Last, but not least, the infamous 'Flashlight man', mentioned in Marty McIntire's review, was from the weekly, parent ""anthology"" series, entitled 'Mystery Movie', which alternated between 'Columbo' and shows like 'McCloud' (Dennis Weaver), 'McMillan and Wife' (Rock Hudson and Susan St. James), and later, 'Hec Ramsey' (Richard Boone), a western dealing with the birth of modern crime detection, such as bullistics, etc.",1115596800,4,1199,4.930693069306931
2077500,3,B0002COTDA,"Columbo is probably my favourite television sleuth.  The combination of smart writing and great performances (mostly) highlight this package of early Columbo episodes, including a very young-looking Peter Falk in the first Columbo movie included in this set (produced 3 years before the rest of the shows on the disc).  As you might expect, there is some variation in Peter Falk's characterisation of Columbo, as the writers and actors had not settled on his final personality until the middle of this first season.

For those that don't know Columbo, every episode follows the same basic path.  The viewers know how the villian committed the murder - the mystery is not how the murder was committed, but what little slipup the murderer made that Columbo will discover.  Early episodes seem to ""cheat"" a little bit - a new piece of evidence is introduced near the end seemingly out of nowhere.  That's not to say that we always know exactly what's going on - for example, we don't know what happened to the body in ""Blueprint for Murder"" until Columbo discovers it.  Likewise we don't know what happened to the murder weapon (a gun) in ""Dead Weight.""  The fun is not so much trying to figure out how the murder was committed (which is what happens in most murder mystery shows) but rather how Columbo figures out the crime.

So why only 3 stars?  Well, basically because the early episodes (even the Steven Spielberg-helmed ""Murder by the Book"") are not as good as later episodes would be.  The performances aren't always the greatest - ""Dead Weight"" is the low point in that respect.  Alternatively, there are some great performances (some by notables such as Robert Culp and Leslie Neilson - in his pre-""Airplane"" days).  Unfortunately, there are no extras of any kind - I guess we should be happy that shows this old are available at all on DVD.  The shows themselves are eminently watchable, and have aged well.  The visuals are crisp and the sound is pretty good.  So pick up a copy of this DVD, because many of the shows (especially the later ones) are among the greatest detective stories ever penned for television.",1113696000,10,2123,4.791208791208791
2077511,5,B0002COTDA,"This first season DVD set of Columbo towers over anything currently running on TV.  Peter Falk stands alone as the only TV cops who is cool, smart, funny, and has a heart.  I've been watching Columbo since the '70s, but never saw most of these episodes, apparently taken out of the rerun list.  This world of Columbo is kind of an alternate reality, where the good guy IS good and the bad guys ARE bad, rich, and overconfident.  Our world unfortunately is more ambiguous.

  The first is Prescription: Murder, the 1968 original movie based on the play, and the only episode officially from the 1960s. Gene Barry plays a psychiatrist who murders his wife and his weak link is his actress girlfriend. There is one scene where the Lieutenant gets rough with her in the sound stage, something not ever done in later episodes. And look for a guy's shadow in the background in the same scene (where they are supposedly alone). Another detail of interest is the guy who makes the false confession is the same actor who played the killer in the contemporaneous ""In the Heat of the Night"". And Falk here has short hair, not so the later ones.

In Ransom For A Dead Man, the 1971 pilot film we get Lee Grant as a lawyer who kills her husband and makes it look like a kidnaping. Patricia Mattick plays the step-daughter who sets her up (she died of cancer in 2003). Here we see Falk having fully fleshed out the character as the seemingly absent-minded cop who is really sharp as a whip. The ending of this one is both well written and well acted as Columbo finds the key: conscience or lack thereof. Also the scenes are done with some cinematic flare, for instance when Lee Grant first appears her eyes intersperse with the car headlights. One inconsistency here is why would she tell Columbo about the autophone device, kind of self-incriminating herself.

In Murder By The Book directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Jack Cassidy (David Cassidy's father) as the killer, we get some humor in the flaky character played by Barbara Colby who tries to extort money from Cassady, but gets killed by him instead. Colby ironically was killed in real life a few years after this episode, but that was never solved. So why would Cassady withdraw the 15 grand hush money if he was going to kill her anyway? Wouldn't it look suspicious. The killers always make at least one dumb mistake.

Death Lends A Hand--This one with Robert Culp is a bit more convoluted as he portrays a contemptable PI. The big mistake here is the victim herself: why would she go to Culp's pad to begin with?

Dead Weight has Eddie Albert as a war hero killer (not neccessarily an irony) and Suzanne Pleshette as the witness. I like how the series portrays psychiatrists, lawyers, war heros, etc. as killers. Makes a statement of the times: these professions don't neccessarily contain such noble people, a thinly vieled counter-cultural thread running through.

Suitable For Framing stars Ross Martin as a pretentious annoying art critic killer. I love the ending with the gloves.

Lady In Waiting is well done and stars Leslie Nielsen as the killer's boyfriend.

Short Fuse stars Roddy McDowell as a mod PHD killer, and this one is the most convoluted episode of all. Pretty hard to follow really, but has a memorable ending.

Blueprint For Murder stars Patrick O'Neal as an architect killer and the plot here doesn't really make sense. Why would he induce Columbo to dig up the pile while the body sits somewhere else, and then try to put the body in afterwards? The logic here fails bigtime. And of course the dumb mistakes he makes like turning the radio of the victim to a classical station when everyone knows he only listens to country.

But all these episodes are worth watching for one main reason. Peter Falk and our delight at watching him insinuate himself into the life of the killer 'til they get annoyed and then get NAILED.
I also recommend the great film Wings of Desire, the Falk plays himself, but everyone stills calls him ""Lieutenant"".",1112313600,10,4016,4.675177304964539

Columbo is one of the best of all time TV mystery series I have ever seen.  The only two US shows I have seen that come close to rivaling it are Kojak (1973) and Monk.

However, I would like to point out that some of the 'British' mysteries are just as good.  I reference P. D.

There was however an ""also available"" booklet listing titles of other Universal tv shows on DVD, but nothing about this series.  That would have been nice, even without any other extras.",1104105600,6,741,4.7734375
2077520,5,B0002COTDA,"I just read all of the great reviews on this DVD.  However there was one mistake made by one of the reviewers in his review.  The reviewer said that on Death Lends a Hand the lady that is killed was having an affair with the private detective that was spying on her (Brimer) and then later tried to blackmail her.  That is incorrect.  I just watched that episode last night and she was having an affair with the golf pro not the private detective.  Still a fine review of all of the episodes in this set.

I can't say much more than all of the reviewers have said.  I, too, was very excited to get this DVD.  In fact I have all 69 episodes on DVD.  I bought it from a company over the internet.  On that set the majority have commercials and logos from : Bravo, USA, A&E and about 5 other television stations.  However even knowing that I bought the entire set.  I am hoping that Univeral will eventually put out the entire 69 episodes.",1104105600,3,936,4.2259887005649714
2077531,5,B0002COTDA,"There is little doubt that Columbo was something of a revolution in the world of detective fiction.  Nowhere will you find the clich car chases, fistfights and gun battles that characterized so many other offerings in the genre.  Nowhere in Columbo's rumpled appearance, shy demeanor and apologetic manner will you find any trace of the hard-boiled, womanizing gumshoes that filled page and screen.  Nor would you find the classic whodunit that would leave the identity of the killer a mystery until the last second.  It's a wonder that the American public got so caught up in Columbo as they did, but the real gimmick that pulls the viewer is the subtle contest of cat-and-mouse between killer and cop that slowly builds throughout each episode.  What's more, some of Columbo's suspects get on to his game and he still manages to beat them in the end.  A perfect example of this is the pilot movie, ""Prescription: Death,"" in which a brilliant psychiatrist kills his wife and manipulates his mistress into helping him cover up the deed.  Columbo, of course, is on the case and his trademark, ""oh, just one more thing,"" tactics for disarming the doctor don't fool him for a second.  Yet, Columbo still manages to capture the killer through his own arrogance in the end.

Other noteworthy episodes from the first season include the premier episode, ""Murder by the Book,"" in which one half of a mystery writing team kills the other using the perfect murder gimmick.  Also, ""Death Lends a Hand,"" in which a private eye kills his client's wife and is then hired by the client to help Columbo find the killer.  Also, ""Blueprint for Murder,"" in which an architect deliberately lets the police suspect him of killing his financial backer so he can hide the body right under Columbo's nose.

Since this was a classic show from the '70's, the visual quality isn't always the greatest.  There are no glossy, computer generated graphics to help the show along.  Nor are there any powerful moral messages meant to expand the consciousness of the viewer.  Yet, none of that is needed when you have the solid performance of Peter Falk in the starring role, along with intelligent plotting and powerful music to aid in the storytelling.  This is as close to character-driven mystery as you're likely to get and it qualifies as good clean escapist fun.  The fact that there are no extras doesn't matter.  This show is a must for any mystery fan's collection.",1103068800,6,2441,4.81294964028777
2077532,5,B0002COTDA,"Not much to add to the entousiastic comments of the longtime fans of this unforgetable t.v  detective. Falk's performance is sheer brilliance and a classic example of how to immortalise a character by showing it's depth in a manner that although funny effortessly  fascinates and entertains. The dialogues still appear clever rather than ""pseudomodern"", a trap so often fatal for other productions of the 70's. The english subtitles included are very accurate and helpful. But let's not stop here shall we? Second season is next on dvd . RIGHT?",1102809600,,544,5.101123595505618
2077533,5,B0002COTDA,"I have waited for years for full seasons of Columbo to be released in any format.  This is a great, great pleasure.  This was unique television for three reasons -- imho -- the concept of knowing the murderer from the start, the personality of the main character, and the incredible quality of the guest stars.  Ray Milland, Robert Culp, Lee Gordon, Ross Marin, Roddy MacDowall.  Incredible.  Three more great episodes from later seasons that I can't wait to see released were the ones starring Dick Van Dyke, John Cassavetes and Ruth Gordon... Please Universal, don't stop!

Two Columbo trivia. First, am I right in saying that in all those years Columbo's first name was never mentioned?  The mysterious Mrs. Columbo is often remarked upon, but was this guy born ""Lt. Columbo?"".  Second, it is not legend but fact that when the Emperor of Japan visited the US in 1975 the person he wanted the most to meet was Peter Falk.  There is something Japanese about the character of Columbo, not showing off, so often saying no when he is thinking yes -- as in ""no, of course you are not a suspect"" -- acting humble and fumbling but always coming out on top.

And, btw, Peter Falk turned the Emperor down!",1102723200,6,1198,4.6350710900473935

2077536,5,B0002COTDA,"What an outrageous yet brilliant idea, to have a detective series where you know who dunnit right from the beginning.  The fascination comes from watching Columbo (Peter Falk) scruffy, vague and (apparently) absent-minded, gradually figure out how the crime was done, and see him close in on his suspect.

Again and again, you derive satisfaction from watching the murderer dismiss Columbo at first as hopeless, then observing their horror as they realise that they'r up against someone much smarter than they'd imagined.  Each episode boils down to a battle of wits between Columbo and the murderer, with Columbo invariably coming out on top. I am still unable, after all these years, to suppress a wistful yearning to one day behold the mysterious Mrs Columbo, of whom we hear so much but never catch a glimpse.

It's great that they've finally brought out the complete first series on DVD, I hope we don't have to wait too long for the other series to appear.",1101772800,7,962,4.883435582822086

The sets and clothes are as much fun as the plot lines. Classic 70's kitsch. The dvd picture quality is nice but no extras at all here...but i will forgive them as long as season two is forthcoming (-:",1101254400,7,631,4.495652173913044
2077538,5,B0002COTDA,"As a long time Columbophile, I was delighted when the first season (plus the two preproduction shows) was finally released on DVD. This is still the most intelligent detective show ever made, and Peter Falk is perfect for the role. This set includes 11 episodes, all of which are good, but some of which are the best of the series, with great guest stars like Robert Culp, Ray Milland, Eddie Albert, Suzanne Pleshette, Leslie Neilsen, and Roddy McDowall. One episode (""Murder by the Book"") is even directed by a very young Steven Spielberg.

Of the bunch, I particularly enjoyed ""Short Fuse,"" ""Lady in Waiting,"" ""Ransom for a Dead Man,"" and Suitable for Framing."" Some actors who make guest appearances don't get the credit they deserve (like the excellent supporting performance in ""Short Fuse"" by William Windom, best known for his portrayal of a deranged starship Captain in ""The Doomsday Machine"" from the original ""Star Trek"" series.) Others, like Don Ameche in ""Suitable for Framing"" gets a guest starring nod despite the fact that he is killed by Ross Martin in the first thirty seconds of the episode.

Of course the genius behind the series is the concept that most in the industry thought would not work: show the murder in the beginning and then watch how Columbo solves the case, instead of the tried and true television plot device of showing the result of the crime and making the audience wonder who did it until the end of the show. This sounds like it would be boring, but it is more cerebral because the viewers already know exactly how the crime was committed. This alone makes ""Columbo"" a masterstroke for intelligent television.

Many reviewers have noted the lack of extras in this set. While that is correct, there are none, it makes no real difference to me: I would have enjoyed outtakes, commentary, etc., but the show stands on its own without any other requirements. This is a great set and I can't wait for the second season.",1100995200,13,1954,4.775147928994083

Raincoat, cigar, hand on head, and the best Detective in TV history!  After waiting it seems a lifetime, they have released the first season of ""Columbo"" on DVD.  Here are the great episodes that launched a legend.  My favorite first season episodes on this set would have to be the pilot ""Prescription: Murder"", Jack Cassidy as the smooth talking mystery writer in ""Murder By the Book"", Roddy McDowall as the rotten nephew bomber in ""Short Fuse"" and Patrick O'Neal in ""Blueprint for Murder"".

Also, you get to see the early work of one of the greatest TV writers and a future movie genius - Stephen Bochco and Stephen Spielberg.

I am eagerly awaiting future seasons of this wonderful series being available on DVD!  If you are a fan of the lovable Lt. Columbo, this is the DVD set to have.",1098748800,15,902,4.5246913580246915
2077540,5,B0002COTDA,"I haven't seen these episodes on TV, at least in the last few years.  Maybe they think the fashions, cars and decor might look dated, but Columbo is timeless.  Obviously Peter Falk is fresh faced and in his early years here, but he sleuths out the murderer with the same dogged questioning and spotting of obscure clues.

The later shows come on TV over and over, but we watch them anyway just to spot clues we missed the first time and for the joy of watching Columbo work.  Now we have his early shows and can watch them whenever we want.  GREAT !!",1098230400,5,550,4.300970873786408
2077551,5,B0002COTDA,"Universal gave Columbo one of their better DVD releases. Sure there are no extras, but thats life. I have memories of seeing it originaly, and got back to watching it a year ago. It was shown in reruns on a cheap local station, with a picture so dark you could not tell if the body was a victim or someone taking a nap. I was very pleased to see that Columbo would finally make it's way to Dvd.
The set includes scene selection, and a play all feature. The picture is sharp and crystal clear. Every gaudy 70's piece of furniture is shown in sharp detail. The sound is wonderfully crisp. All in all, a package worth owning. It may be a bit pricey, but amazon has it down to a fair amount.

2077553,5,B0002COTDA,"So what if they're no extras!!! Fans of Peter Falk's one-of-a-kind supersleuth should be pleased with this release of the landmark first episodes of this thirty-year television institution.

One can delight in ""Prescription for Murder,"" the NBC TV-movie from the late 60's that introduced the world to the Italian-American gumshoe. Columbo was a bit abrasive in this first time out and he wasn't wearing his trademark, disheveled raincoat, but he still showed the deductive savvy that would endure throughout the series. The episode succeeds with great acting from Falk, Gene Barry, Justice, and acting luminary Nina Foch.

Also, a jazzy Dave Grusin score helps move things along quite nicely.

By the time of the second TV-movie, ""Ransom for a Dead Man,"" the character was dressed appropriately and was spouting that annoying, ""One more thing..."" that would become a show staple of the detective. It is appropriate that Lee Grant, one of the industry's trailblazers for women in film, would be cast as a crafty lawyer that kills her husband but must contend with the wily Columbo.

It wasn't until the Steven Spielberg-directed first episode (""Murder by the Book"") of the series that viewers would find the Columbo that would be around for the next, and counting, three decades.

""Death Lends a Hand"" features Robert Culp who would appear in three more Columbo's. It also has a unique camera trick involving Culp's character's glasses.

""Lady in Waiting"" has Susan Clark and Richard Anderson as dysfunctional siblings with the former deciding that it's better to be an only child! The episode also stars Leslie Nielsen during his dramatic, second-tier leading man-days.

There are numerous pleasures in the remaining episodes, many of them featuring the brilliant scoring of Billy Goldenberg, a Universal Studios landmark.

Though extras would be nice, the wonders of Falk and company are enough to satisfy fans of a good who-dunit!",1095465600,19,1933,5.192926045016077
2077554,4,B0002COTDA,No extras? Not a single interview?? I LOVE Columbo. I don't know what it is about that show that I find addictive. Seeing Universal FINALLY release Season One on DVD is great!

I do agree with some others who have commented with regard to more (or any) special features.  It would be nice to hear some background on episodes or on the Columbo series as a whole.  Is there possibly a blooper/Gag reel somewhere?  Dare to dream!  I also found it odd that Universal chose to use the image of Columbo, from the 1990's series, at the main menu screens.  It does not make sense to include it with the first season DVD's.  More of an oddity then a complaint though.

Overall, an EXCELLENT compilation that I would highly recommend to anyone!",1095292800,5,771,4.404255319148936
2077556,5,B0002COTDA,"Since there are 9 movies, this review will feature brief thoughts on each one and each will have it's own rating:

1. PRESCRIPTION: MURDER *****
Doctor Ray Fleming has a problem: he is having an affair with a young woman-Joan Hudson. His wife(played by Nina Foch)suspects that he is doing more than just ""treating a patient"" when he gets a call from her and walks out in the middle of thier anisversery party. 6 months ago she gave him a choice: End this affair or face divorce. This presents the doctor with a problem-he stands to lose a lot of money if she divorces him. Solution? Murder her! A murder six months in the making, with the help of his mistress-they carry out the plot. The doctor has yet another problem: Lt. Columbo is on the case-he knows the doctor is guilty and to prove it-he sets up a very clever trap for the doctor-with the help of....you guessed it-Ms. Hudson. The best of the two pilot movies.

2. RANSOM FOR A DEAD MAN ***1/2
Lee Grant plays a lawyer who murders her husband and then manufactures a kidnapping. This woman is very smart! She pays the ransom of $300.000 from money from various stocks and trust accounts. She eventualy gets the money herself and hides it. There is only one problem: Part of the ransom was paid from her stepdaughter's trust account! With her help, Columbo sets up a trap to prove her guilt.

3. MURDER BY THE BOOK ***
This episode is noted for one of Steven Spieldberg's early directoral efforts. And overall, he did a good job. However, the director can only do much with a so-so script. This is the weakest of the first season-but Jack Cassidy and Martin Milner carry things along nicely. James Ferris and Ken Franklin(Milner and Cassidy)are part of a writing team of the Mrs Melville mystery novels. They both become rich-but Ferris wants to write on his own. What the american public doesn't know is that Ferris does all the writing and Franklin does the publicly. The break up would expose the truth and Franklin stands to lose alot. He plots the ""Perfect murder"" However, He is blackmailed by a witness and Lt. Columbo uncovers a clue that spoils his ""Perfect Murder"" It just seems that this clue was written in at the last minute-which weakens it. Still entertaining however.

4. DEATH LENDS A HAND****
Ray Miland plays Arthur Kenicut-a Hearst like publisher who hires a Private detective Brimmer(Robert Culp) to determine whether or not his wife is having an affair. She has been-but Brimmer falistfies the report. Her lover is none other than Brimmer himself. Now, he tries to blackmail her into being a pipeline of information-her husband has a lot of politcal connections. But She refuses to be blackmailed and threatens to tell her husband the truth about thier affair. In a fit of rage, he knocks her down and kills her. Out of fear, he covers up the accident. Lt. Columbo is on the case however and he sets up a trap for brimmer using of all things-a pair of Contact lenses!!! This episode is noted for being one of the few episodes where the murder was an accident-not premedicated.

5. DEAD WEIGHT *****
Eddie Albert plays General Hollister-a retired marine. Col. Dutton pays the general a visit. He tells him that the marine corps is opening a full scale investagation into arms contracts. The general's contruction company overcharged the government. The Col tells Hollister that he is leaving. Instead of risking exposure, Hollister Picks up a gun and kills Col Dutton. Unfourtanitly, Mrs. Stewart(Suzzane Pleshette)is in a sail boat with her mother and she wittnesses a shooting in the house across the marina. Her report is considered a crackpot report until Col. Dutton's body is found. Lt. Columbo is on the case. THe general's tremendous beleif in himself will give him away.

6. Suitable for framing *****
Dale Kingston(Ross Martin)is obsessed with his uncle's paint collection. So much so, he kills him in cold blood. With the help of his accomplce, they frame his Aunt for the crime. But Lt. Columbo is on the case and he is not taken in by his flamboyant personalty. To prove his guilt, Lt. Columbo sets up a trap using fingerprints. I just love the look on Mr. Kingston's face when he realizes that he is trapped! As a side note: Ross Martin was the one time acting teacher of Peter Falk.

7. LADY IN WAITING ****1/2
Susan Clark plays Beth Chadwick who is in love with the family's company's lawyer Peter Hamiltion(Leslie Nielsen)But her Brother Bryce objects to the relationship. Now beth feels that she's been controlled all her life-first by her father, now by her brother. Bryce informs Beth that he has written a letter to Peter-quit seeing beth or face being fired as the company's lawyer. Beth has had enough! She plots the murder of her brother. She kills him and make it look like an accident. In fact The jury of the inquest rules it an accident. But with Lt Columbo on the case-he's not buying it-He believes it was premedicated. Her irractional behaviouer and the answer to a crucial question that only Peter knows the answer to-proves her guilt.

8. SHORT FUSE ****1/2
Roddy McDowall plays Roger Stanford-a sceientst who works for Stanford chemicals-a family owned company. He is very upset with his uncle's decision to sell the company. Now he is called into his office for a meeting. He tries to blackmail Roger into leaving the company or else he will release damaging information about roger to the public. Rather than submit to blackmail, Roger kills his uncle by planting cigars that is rigged with a bomb. However, Lt. Columbo is on the case and he knows Roger is Guilty and to prove it-he takes Roger for a ride in a place where he can't run away-it is there that Columbo comfronts Roger.

9. Blueprint for muder *****
Beau Williamson(Forrest Tucker)is very upset. He is seen driving through town real fast. He goes to Elliot Markham's office to confront him. Without His knowlage or approval, Mr. Markham is building ""Williamson City"" A community that includes schools and hospitals and so on. But Beau objects and confronts Markham at the contruction site. When Beau gets into his car, Markham is hiding. He is forced at gunpoint to go into a nearby stable-a shot is heard. Lt. Columbo is on the case and he suspects Markham is guilty-but has a hard time proving it. It proves to be Columbo's toughest case of the first season. However, when Markham is caught trying to hide the body-in a place that has been already searched-his guilt is finally proven.

So there you have it-the first season. Peter falk was born to play Columbo. Loaded with Geust stars of the finest of Hollywood-this is what makes Columbo a special show-now we await the second season!",1095120000,20,6667,4.719931271477663
2077557,5,B0002COTDA,I just wanna say that Columbo is an excellent show! I love the way Peter Falk harasses the guilty until they have no choice but to confess their guilt. I was waiting for this to hit DVD for a long time so imagine how excited I was to see this on the shelf in the store. This is one of the best shows ever made this is a must have to your collection!,1095033600,3,349,3.7945205479452055
2077558,5,B0002COTDA,"Although I've only watched the first DVD in the set, I already feel that it was well worth the money and, for the price, I do not expect any extras.

Back around 1991, I paid $40 for the first release of ""Prescription: Murder"" on VHS. It was a special order item and was probably targeted for the rental market rather than home use. To have the entire first season plus two movies for roughly the same price is a bargain.

A few months later, ABC aired ""Ransom For A Dead Man"" and it was the only time I ever saw that episode on television. Lee Grant did a wonderful job playing against Peter Falk. She had great facial expressions to go along with her polite responses to Columbo's idiotic questions.

Given the age of the films, I thought the transfer was very good. Some of the night scenes are a bit grainy but overall I have no complaints. I only wish they had created more ""chapters"" - four is not enough for a 90 minute movie. One for every commercial break would be better.

If they do include extras on a future set, I hope they include the NBC Mystery Movie introduction with that Henry Mancini theme music. It's what I remember most about those Sunday night movies back in the 1970s.",1094688000,8,1194,4.364864864864865
2077559,5,B0002COTDA,"I love it when he says that, because it is always followed up by some miscalculation by the 'killer'. Well, I got into this show 'a bit late', like about 6 months ago...? I'm in my mid thirty's which is young enough to watch current programming but old enough to know current programming is, in general, unwatchable. So, what do we do? We reach back. This show happens to be on a current 'public-esque' TV channel and since I don't have cable, I take what I can get. Understand, I don't live by the mantra ""what's old is good"", because there are plenty of shows I actually used to watch that just didn't age well; Land of the Lost (**.5) and the A-Team (**.5) come to mind.

Enter Columbo.

The Price*****: I'll admit it... I was standing in the store saying to myself, roughly forty dollars is a lot to spend on 7 episodes, and 2 mini movies/pilots. The minutes weren't really an issue but '7' seems a bit low when compared to other shows that have generally 24 eps. Well, having just viewed ONLY the Pilot: Prescription Murder, I feel as though I picked Universals pocket. This one ep. to me is worth what I paid for the set, heck it's better than most movies I own. Peter Falk hits the ground running, and even though the ep. does lag in places it is a truly remarkable piece of TV history.

Format*****: The format of the show is intriguing. Each episode is 1.5 hours as opposed to 1 hour. The first 1/2 hour is generally dedicated to the `set-up` (guest stars), but this is crucial b/c not only is it quite a long time without Peter Faulk/Columbo, but it shows each show can stand up alone without the VERY worthy Peter Falk propping it up. Sure there are some clunkers, but not many I've seen. Anyway, once the murder is committed you really feel attached to the story because you've lived with these characters outside of the murder for awhile (well, 20-30 minutes)... anyway, Columbo gets there and starts making observations that doesn't exactly jibe with what was said, and slowly the screw turns... ""See..., that's what I don't understand..."" An `awe-shucks' Columbo says scratching his head, ""I thought you said..."" and from there the screws turn... tighter.

Sound**: Why don't they take the time to go 5.1DD? I'm not going to rebuy this whole season in a few years like Star Trek. Thoughtful dialogue and characters do not NEED 5.1DD to be enjoyable so there is no reason to rebuy it, but why not just raise the price of the set somewhat to give us it right out of the gate?  The actual soundtrack is often brillant, however.

Transfer***.5: Seems clear and clean. No complaints on a technical level, though I have only viewed the pilot.

Packaging*****: The boxart is perfect. The strip of trench coat at the top is genius! Plus, when you open it, you are greeted with a great sense of Columbo; his dialogue. I do wish all the photos taken would have been Season One exclusively but I guess they went with variety. Some Mr. Falk is easily 10-15 years older. But the quality of the art is fantastic, maybe a disc or two could have had pics of the car to break up the concept of needing multiple aging pics?

Conclusion*****: While I sit on the fence and wonder whether Baretta or SWAT are worth my time (VERY vague memories of these also), I can rest assured that they just might be worth it. It is possible for shows 'you weren't quite old enough' to watch to be treasures. Funny, if Columbo wasn't currently on TV I may have sat on the fence and 'wondered' about this release too. Columbo simply captures everything I view television for; great writing, great characters (starring and guest starring <--which is rare), and geniune feeling. Somehow in my brain I know the show is 'scripted' and yet Columbo has such a great aire about him, you'd swear even if there wasn't a script, these very words would still roll out of his mouth. TV shows like Columbo are almost a mixed bag in a sense for DVD release because while they stand the test of time they at the same time make current televison a living, screaming, nightmare by comparison.

2077560,4,B0002COTDA,"The irony of the title of this package -- and an interesting bit of trivia for buffs -- is that ""Columbo"" was never actually a series. There was never a ""Columbo"" show to have a first season and, in fact, none of the ""episodes"" were even ""episodes."" They were mini-movies, anywhere from 90 minutes to two hours, which were either segments in a rotating ""Mystery Movie"" anthology -- either on NBC or ABC -- or they were stand-alone movie events.

Of course, that's something that has no bearing whatsoever on the fact that these fine and fun movies are finally collected for fans. The only reason this review isn't five stars is because of the lack of extras.

Like all fans, I have my favorite segments. The Jack Cassidy segment in the first season is a stand-out and, as the movie series continued, I got a kick out of those episodes in which the name guest stars returned for repeat murderous performances -- Cassidy, Robert Culp, Patrick McGoohan, etc.",1094256000,7,955,4.644970414201183

I figure them out too soon or in the cases where I don't, the resolution is a severe let down.  I'm not an amateur genius detective or anything, I just have a good memory and tend to keep certain aspects of the mystery catalogued as I watch.  Columbo, however, is a murder mystery show of a different animal.  Quite frankly, no show of its type has been more original in presentation, format or style before or after its initial launch in the 60's.

The reason for this bold claim?  Peter Falk and the innovative idea to reveal the murderer at the start of the tale.  The enjoyment, and I'm sure many of you have heard this time and time again, in watching a Columbo episode is; a. the interaction between Columbo and the suspect; b. the personal mannerisms of the Columbo character; c. following Columbo as he uncovers every facet of the crime committed and pieces them together and; d. the satisfaction of being in on the moment when the killer is exposed.  Instead of being surprised like the killer is, you get the satisfaction of being a silent partner with Columbo as he brings the culprit to justice.

Few shows are based in total reality, and indeed, this show harkens back to a time when people weren't as savvy about every detail of crime solving as they are now what with constant airings of documentaries on A&E such as Cold Case Files and drama based modern shows like CSI on CBS.  But what helps Columbo stand the test of time ultimately is the performance of Peter Falk in the role of Columbo and a sense of relief in not having to constantly try and figure out who the killer is throughout the episode.  Below is a short synopsis of the episodes and original movies that will be included on this 5 disc set:

Prescription: Murder (1968)

Gene Barry plays a cheating doctor out to get rid of the main obstacle standing in the way of him and his young, pretty actress girlfriend.  This first movie introduces the audience to the typical type of villain Columbo will face in future episodes; rich, famous and well connected politically...and sometimes all three.

Note: This episode is especially interesting to watch due to the fact that the Columbo character had yet to be fully fleshed out by Peter Falk.  He is seen being rather harsh in this episode and would only rarely show this type of rage again in any other episode.  He toned down the character and made him much more laid back later on.

Ransom for a Dead Man (1971)

A lawyer (Lee Grant) kills her husband for the insurance money and makes the whole thing look like a kidnapping.  It never hurt the Columbo series that most of the guest stars were actors or actresses every bit as talented as Peter Falk himself, something Murder She Wrote could rarely claim.

Murder by the Book (1971)

Jack Cassidy in one of a number of memorable turns on the show plays one half of a successful writing team...the untalented half.  When his partner makes it known his intentions to break up the team, Jack Cassidy's character makes sure he regrets that decision.

Note:  Jack Cassidy is the father of Shaun and David Cassidy.  This episode is directed by a very young Steven Spielberg whose other early TV directing gig was an episode of Night Gallery.

Death Lends a Hand (1971)

Robert Culp guests as the owner of a powerful detective agency who murders a client's wife.  One of my favorite episodes of them all, and includes some of the earliest tidbits of information regarding Columbos past.

Dead Weight (1971)

Eddie Albert plays a retired military officer bent on keeping his corruption a secret, even if it requires murdering a subordinate.  The only problem?  Helen Stewart (Suzanne Pleshette) sees the whole thing from a sail boat on the water.  The only obstacle she has is proving to the police and her own mother that she isn't batty and just seeing things.  Of course, Columbo believes her, which is strangely fitting since the police on the scene feel he's just as batty as she is!

Suitable for Framing (1971)

Ross Martin kills his uncle for a valuable art collection and tries to pin the whole thing on said uncle's first wife.  Overall, the only weak link in an otherwise stellar first season in my opinion but a good episode regardless.  And be sure to look out for Don Ameche in a guest starring role.

Note:  Ross Martin was the one time acting teacher to Peter Falk.

Lady in Waiting (1971)

Susan Clark plays a woman who kills her brother in order to take over the family company.  She attempts to make it seem like a case of mistaken identity thinking he is an intruder.  Leslie Nielsen guest stars as her non-bumbling boyfriend.

Note:  This episode was written by Steven Bochco who later gave us stunning television such as Cop Rock. ;)

Short Fuse (1972)

Roddy McDowall guest stars as a brilliant scientist whose uncle wants to force out of the family chemical company.  Something tells us that the uncle won't make it very far in the episode with that sort of attitude!  The multi-talented Ida Lupino guest stars as our perps aunt providing some dramatic weight to balance Roddys' frenetic performance.  Cigars play a crucial role in uncovering the nephew's guilt, something I'm sure Columbo relishes in the end.

Blueprint For Murder (1972)

Forrest Tucker makes a brief but memorable turn as an obnoxious Texas developer who gets the short end of the jerky stick when his architect murders him to keep a proposed building project from being axed.  Probably my second favorite episode from the first season and it ends up being the toughest case so far for Columbo to break.

So there you have it.  An outstanding start to an outstanding series.  This is the first and probably last review I will write for a television program, but Columbo deserves my attention and will hopefully earn yours as well.  Forget the A-Team DVD set and plunk down your hard earned cash on this one instead, you won't regret it!",1093824000,410,5986,4.62962962962963
2077583,5,B0002COTDA,"Yes... for all us Columbo fans, just a coulpe of weeks til the release... COLUMBO!!!!. I do agree with a few of you that Columbo is one of the worlds best (tv) Lieutenants but only on the west coast. His ability to catch the bad guy...Its been a long wait for this release. The other best (tv) lieutenant would be ""who loves ya' baby"" the best east coast KOJAK!!!! and yes from a reliable source, Kojak will be release on DVD before the end of this year. So... as all of you can see the two very very best of the 1970's crime shows are about to be released and 5 stars is just not enough for the two shows. YES!!!! YES!!!! YES!!!! These two shows just have me BUG-N.",1093392000,3,666,4.130769230769231
2077584,3,B0002COTDA,"Reviewer: A viewer

I heartily second the sentiments of the previous commentary..""Universal has done the same thing to Columbo that they did to The Night Gallery series-no interviews,no documentaries and no remastering of the print. This is not good enough.""

Again the point made of ""an interview with Peter Falk and have him tell us about his movie career and his 30 year association with Columbo,which is one of the longest acting experiences in media history"" is absolutely how I feel.

Let's hope Universal DOES get this feedback, and includes these delightful and interesting ideas on the next season's release!!

I've been waiting and hoping for this collection on DVD and can't wait to receive the first season. Hopefully, the rest of the episodes will soon follow.",1092960000,22,773,5.062992125984252

I wasted not one second in pre-ordering it and will order every single one that comes out on DVD. I love Peter Falk and Columbo! Cheesy as it can be sometimes, I will tell you that I am VERY excited to see these movies become available. WOO-HOO!!!

2077588,5,B0002COTDA,"Peter Falk's Columbo ranks as one of the greatest TV detective characters ever created. His ability to capture the kirky Los Angeles Lieutenant has captivated decades of viewers and is sure to also capture younger fans with this long-awaited DVD release.
Created by Richard Levinson and William Link, the series debuted in 1971 with ""Murder by the Book,"" which was actually the third appearance of Falk's Columbo (there had been two previous two-hour NBC World Premiere Movies prior to the series launch.) Interestingly, ""Murder by the Book"" was directed by a then unknown talent: Steven Spielberg.
Columbo was unique in so many ways, the first was that the viewer learned the killer's identity in the first few minutes of every episode. Up until then, detective shows and mysteries had tried to keep the audience guessing ""Who Done It?"" until the very final scene. Levinson and Link turned that formula upside down, letting viewers in on the intracacies of the crime from the killer's viewpoint, their motivation, and what they did to cover their tracks to avoid discovery.
Often, Columbo was not even introduced until 20 minutes or more into the episodes (which ran a network 90 minutes with commercials instead of the usual 60 minutes for dramas.)
However, as soon as the audience caught a glimpse of the short, rumpled, cigar-smoking detective with the tan rain coat, they knew that they were watching something really special. Columbo feigned a scatter-brained approach, but it was soon obvious to viewers and the episode's killer that beneath his step-and-fetch-it manner lay the cooly brilliant mind of a master detective. And, it was the cat-and-mouse interplay and dialog between Columbo and the criminal that was at the heart of this brilliant series.
Smartly written and tightly crafted, the dramatic tension was created as Columbo slowly chipped away the layers of subterfuge left by the killer to reveal the mechanics of the crime and the killer.
Throughout the series, which spanned three decades after several relaunches as specials, Falk's black hair turned gray, but he wore the exact same rain coat while pursuing some of the best actors and actresses on TV or in the movies who portrayed various extremes of melevolent killers. A virtual ""who's who"" of the acting profession did a turn on Columbo.
To say that Columbo affected the TV mystery genre is to give it far too little credit: it changed it forever and produced a detective from which his alter ego, the vastly talented Falk, will also never be able to escape.
Let's hope the studio takes a clue from Colombo and quickly releases the rest of these outstanding episodes!",1088467200,137,2646,5.015909090909091
