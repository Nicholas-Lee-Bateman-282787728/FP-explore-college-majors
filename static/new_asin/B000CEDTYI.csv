8098056,5,B000CEDTYI,"This movie is unsettling in that Tom is playing a deranged serial killer, but other than that it has what I want - lots of Tom Berenger onscreen.  That's all I want.",1258848000,,165,4.15625
8098057,4,B000CEDTYI,"The story is unique and simple. There isn't a lot of backstory nor are there a lot of questions answered, but the movie is so well done that you don't really care. It works best NOT knowing.

Very underrated.",1209340800,,208,4.333333333333333
