Horrible, talentless and boring. I donated this thrash to public library.",1191888000,,245,4.857142857142857
7914324,1,B00000K4ZS,"Seeing Karajan for the first time is a bit of a shock - here is a visibly ill and uncomfortable old man standing in front of one of the great orchestras of the world, making a laborious effort to summon up the glories of his legendary interpretations.
Does the orchestra need him?
Well, probably not: orchestral accents and dynamics appear to be created by the players' collective memory of countless performances of these symphonies rather than any gestural prompting or cues, which are few.  However, the orchestra clearly needed someone to be more effectively at the helm, given some appalling lapses in ensemble.  In their best moments (fleetingly few) these performances are only a shadow of the 60's and 70's recordings, although they do convey the weighty Berlin sound in more detail and show the oversized orchestra used for this repertoire.  Students of conducting will gain little from watching this, except to see how a great orchestra performs when the conductor is unable to give much useful direction.
In short this is a sad legacy, because Karajan was one of the great masters of his art.  Look elsewhere.",1072742400,9,1120,4.941489361702128

7914326,5,B00000K4ZS,"At this point, Sony has released all of its von Karajan performances of the Beethoven symphonies on five DVDs. They are all very good performances, created for film (rather than concert performance) in the early 80s.  Von  Karajan conducts the Berlin Philharmonic, his personal orchestra, and the  performance is as much von Karajan as Beethoven.  Musically, these are very  fine performances, with von Karajan in absolute control of the orchestra  which plays very precisely.  These are the performance as he wanted to  present them -- smooth, well thought-out, and note-perfect.
There is  probably no right way to put symphonic music onto film -- these productions  (made by conductor's own film company) spend most of their time focused on  the conductor with cut-away shots to both individual and groups of  instrumentalists (also singers in the 9th), usually focusing on the  instruments themselves rather than the players.
It is fascinating to  watch von Karajan -- his authority in the music and with this orchestra are  clear thoughout each performance.  He conducts without a baton and uses his  whole body to conduct, though not in a distracting way (I am thinking of  Leonard Bernstein here).
The sound and picture on these DVDs are  excellent; the sound is truly comparable to a well-recorded CD.  The  soundtrack is available both in stereo and also an excellent 5.1 Dolby mix.  The disks have a set of program notes and a biography of von Karajan.",962236800,19,1461,5.050420168067227

7914328,5,B00000K4ZS,"There is something special with the last recordings of Karajan. The years made him less mathematical and now there is space for emotions. The two symphonies differ so much in character, one is classical, the other is  romantic. Both are performed as never before, with energy and matury at the  same time. What they have in common is the intensive use of counterpoint,  and these versions let you notice this like no other. These are reference  versions, equally enjoyable by both casual listeners and music students.",953337600,11,517,4.976744186046512
7914329,5,B00000K4ZS,"Despite what you may hear from down under, people who know Beethoven and particularly know the Eroica Symphony believe it may have been Karajan's masterpiece with regard to Beethoven.  His earlier recordings were fine,  but this is one piece that truly grew in stature with El Maestro as he  aged.  The slow movement is particularly compelling.  Herbie may have been  thinking of his own funeral, and he certainly regarded himself as a hero.  Regardless of his ego or motivations, the performance is what counts, and  Karajan and the Berliner really deliver the goods on this one.  I believe  any of you would find this a great performance, and a great video.",950659200,15,659,4.8558558558558556
