8186585,4,B000OTA3DG,"Before anyone says anything, I admit I was looking through some hentai to actually try to find one that stands out. What makes me happy is that this hentai stands out in the sense there is a plot. Think of Fate Stay Night (as this was a visual novel game with plenty of sexual encounters but people tend to forget this from watching the anime or manga given these two continuities removed all of the description).

The series is an action/horror with going all out on the fanservice...but the fanservice in this series isn't really fanservice if you know what I mean. Because it's a horror, it was more depressing to see the scenes play out then anything else.

But back to the plot, its basically about two feuding families at a college (I'm assuming its a college instead of a high school but its hard to tell with the way the characters are drawn). The Otori family is the main family and the Kameyama family is the branch family trying to take control of the school and its based on which girl has the most spiritual strength to become the head (and I'm certain Mao, the main girl is next in line given how the enemy targets her a lot and her ignores her older sister). Mao's aunt decides that the only way to obtain the head is to summon an ancient demon to tear the family apart. To do this, she must sacrifice five maidens that ""witnessed"" the summoning. Because most of the witnesses are ordinary students with no powers, they're targeted first. The first to be raped by the mysterious figure dubbed the Iron Mask and only by an intervention by Mao's guardian and teacher Akira does she get saved first, but at the end of the first episode, Senna is the first one killed despite Mao's attempts to save her (and she beats herself over this for the rest of the series).

With each episode, one girl gets killed off (and there are six episodes but this boxset only has 3 episodes). The plot is very complicated from here on out because the family is very dysfunctional and each episode attempts to dive into the backstory of the family that is willing kill innocent people at the school in order to get the head. While Mao wants to stop the murders, her sister Himeko just wants Mao to survive this and isn't afraid to get her hands dirty. Its to be noted that because the family has spiritual powers, they are able to protect themselves from the hentai monsters easily. Mao gets the hot teacher Akira (who serves as a fox (?) spirit) while Himeko gets a water demon (forgot his name). Mao and Himeko also have a cousin on the other side of the family named Hitomi who fits the stereotype aloof, flat chested anti-hero who protects Mao from the shadows and attempts to stop her mother from summoning the demon (and fails for obvious reasons...hint: its because its a hentai).

Also, because each girl gets killed per episode, you actually see Mao fall into depression with each friend that gets killed (the irony is her three friends all saw the ""summoning"" so they're chosen) and you feel for her especially in the second episode where after a traumatizing event: hint: think hentai again, she chooses to isolate herself from her friends and you really feel sorry for her and might I say relate to her given what had occurred.

I love how her friends are fleshed out too (even if they were to get killed an episode later). Mayaka (spelling) who is shown in the first episode actually survives until episode 4 and ironically, she has no powers but she's the girl that can kick butt without spiritual energy (and her capture in episode 4 is depressing given the events that lead up to it). Like Mayaka is the girl that likes Mao's guardian and teacher Akira (and Akira is a decent guy to avoid doing anything to her which gives him a plus) and while I always felt this yuri vibe with her, she's the one who wants to solve the mystery of the family (and learns the most of all the girls).

This series still gets a 4 stars because the dub is horrible! I don't appreciate the same voice actor used for most of the girls making it hard to differentiate between them all and some of the lines are just so cheesy. I know its a hentai but the voices ruin some really sad scenes and this anime has A LOT of depressing scenes to go with the action and horror. Like Mao's voice is decent as well as Hitomi but everyone is just blah.

You're more lucky to find the entire series online or better yet finding the sub version. I can't recommend this to people because of the rating and mainly because I found this anime on a whim when searching for action/horror anime like Devil Hunter Yohko (and I thought that's what this series was like given the plot and I was thrown for a loop...)",1363132800,6,4679,4.440046565774156
8186586,5,B000OTA3DG,"Welcon to Pia Carrot gets it right in all catigories.
The characters are fun. Some I like others make me go GRRRRR! every time they come on.
It looks absolutley great. If I made an anime this is how I would like it to look.
The story is involving to me any way I just want to watch more to find out what hapens next. WARNING CAN BE ADICTIVE.
The kinky stuf is thier but it is part of the story so it is ok.
I like the Japanese with subtitles version best not that thier is anything wrong with  the dubed version. I find it is just more fun in Japanese. Japanese people may like the dubed version because it sounds difrent. That's something to ponder on.
So if your interested do yourself a favor and purchase this set and then try to find welcome to Pia Carrot 2 . Both are hard to find so get them when you can.",1361750400,,812,4.012345679012346
