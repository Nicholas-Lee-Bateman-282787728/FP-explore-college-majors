946256,5,6304972857,It was a wonderful movie a definite five stars!  It captured all of Dicken's story and added so much more life to it making it worthwhile.  There was not one part in the entire movie where it lost its carisma.  I  loved it and could watch it over and over again!,913161600,,262,4.078431372549019
946257,4,6304972857,"A film that nicely captures the male angst of the decent (yet driven) guy trying to obtain the unobtainable (in life, in love).  Cinematography stellar in parts (notice the scene under the bridge in Central Park).  This  film is good on so many levels, that it clearly shows that a classic story  is for all times.",913075200,,314,4.553571428571429

946259,5,6304972857,"Incredible movie! Excellent acting, sets, and musical selections. Despite many critics calling it a fluke, the film sends a clear message: the classics are timeless in any interpretation (even in modernity). In fact, I  call this the most overlooked secret of 1998.",912470400,,265,5.309523809523809

946647,5,6304972857,"I remember seeing it when it came out and I've watched it again twice recently. I think the acting is great - RD is awesome - so convicting, strong and sweet; AB is scary and brilliant; EH is so great - tortured, distracted, raw; GP is incredibly sexy....I love the house...the scenery is awesome.

So it's basically like a win-win cause I get to keep the movie and she gets to scorn me by refusing my gift.

Isn't life wonderful ???

 Anyway, it's a pretty cool movie. Robert Deniro kills in it. You'll be...uh....watching Ethan Hawke's performance...like a hawk.

I always did like this movie.  You should watch it.

Why ??? Because it's definitely better than being forced to watch ""Nanny Mcphee"" at gun point while slightly off to your left a tour guide from Sea World gestures toward a plate of sloppy joe's which you would rather sign up for the draft than eat.",1475625600,,650,4.4576271186440675

946767,2,6304972857,"I have no objection in principle to updating ""classic"" works for movies -- the recent ""Coriolanus"" with Ralph Fiennes was really well done.  The problem with this updated ""Great Expectations"" is partly the same problem that ANY movie of this story has that tries to cram it into 120 minutes.  That's not enough time to do justice to the childhood story (Pip's in Dickens, Finn's in this one) AND to the story of his moral awakening in the city after he has been bankrolled to an easier life by his unknown benefactor.  Especially, the reappearance of the benefactor comes too late for a relationship between them to develop.  By contrast, a TV series gives time both for the development of that relationship AND full treatment of the young man's discomfort at a visit by Joe, his guardian and brother-in-law from the sticks and a reminder of a poverty-stricken past that he (Pip or Finn) would rather forget in his new sophisticated surroundings.  In this movie, Joe shows up at the opening of Finn's show at a ritzy gallery, and he behaves inappropriately.  The focus is on Joe's apologies, while really it should be on Finn's cold behavior.  Here, though, Finn (Ethan Hawke) doesn't seem any colder to Joe than to anyone else (he's distractedly looking for Estella), so his insensitivity just doesn't feature.  Later, when Robert DeNiro shows up, we don't get enough time to see a relationship develop, and the circumstances of his death are unclear in a way that they're not in the novel.  The most recent movie version for the cinema, which featured Ralph Fiennes as Magwitch, had the same problem of not having time for the boy and benefactor relationship to develop.

These problems are problems that stem from the insufficient length of the movie.  A more serious problem is the lack of chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Estella.  Hawke just can't find a kind of expressiveness that differentiates his affect from his usual manner. and Paltrow simply isn't a credible object of desire.  It's not at all clear why she marries the man she does (played here by Hank Azaria), a pleasant nonentity.  In the novel (and in most other film versions), the relation between Miss Havisham's manipulation, Estella's coldness, and her marriage to the rich and despicable Bentley Drummle is crystal clear.  I think that it was also a mistake to make Finn an artist -- a person who thus was able to have a possibility of ""making it"" by his own efforts.  In the novel, and in earlier movie versions, Pip is an idle ""gentleman"" who has to learn what it means to be a responsible person, and learn the hard way.  He has to go from being a thoughtless idler to a morally sensitive adult.  Having Finn have, in effect, a profession, blurs the point about moral growth.

As with the earlier filmed versions, the part that focuses on the boy's childhood is the most arresting -- both dramatically and visually.  The Miss Havisham figure here is played by Anne Bancroft, in an imaginatively ditzy impersonation, the drawback of which is that her malign influence on Estella isn't established.  Chris Cooper is fine as Joe, and DeNiro is effectively scary in the opening scene -- shades of ""Cape Fear""!  But really, it's the romantic leads who let us down, I'm afraid.",1456704000,,3278,4.785079928952043

Director Alfonso Cuarn's updating of the Charles Dicken's novel from Mitch Glazer's screenplay works on a whole different level. For me, this film is an impressionist view of the central events of the novel updated to modern times. Gwyneth Paltrow's very ethereal and aloof Estella is mesmerizing through the eyes of Ethan Hawke's somewhat obsessed Finnegan Bell. I really felt Ethan Hawke's struggle and setbacks as he aspired to greater things, the greatness of who he was and was so capable of being. I came away pleased, mainly because it was very thought provoking in a sense that you ask yourself if you are striving for all that you are in your own life.

The modern version takes place in Florida and New York City.  tt begins with the evolution of a young boy, abandoned by his parents, and raised by a sympathetic and caring live-in boy friend of his useless and philandering older sister.  The lad has a natural talent for drawing, which ultimately brings him fame and financial success as a young adult .

The acting/characterization of David Lean's b&w version is unsurpassed, and the authentic visualizations of Julian Jarrold's (Masterpiece Theater) rendering are superb.  But Cuaron's ""transportation"" of the novel to a Florida/Gulf Coast fishing village, along with the invention of Finn (Pip) as a young artist - to say nothing of the explicit dramatization of the sexual motives so energetically suppressed by Dickens - sheds new and vivid light on the story.  Yes, the ""light"" is relentlessly green (it goes with the setting and with the theme), but it's beautifully composed.  Mitch Glaser's screenplay anchors the film perfectly, and the casting (Hawke, Paltrow, DiNiro, Cooper, Bancroft, Azaria) could not be more persuasive.  Is it Dickens?  Only Dickens is Dickens; even the celebrated David Lean abbreviated the text.  But Cuaron's re-creation of Dickens' story preserves all the essentials of the original while brilliantly illuminating others (Pip the ""writer"" of his own story becomes Finn the ""artist"" of his own experience).  That said, students looking to take short-cuts should be warned against viewing this film - especially this film - as a substitute for reading the novel: both have their distinctive pleasures, but Cuaron as an artist challenges the master rather than submitting to him.",1363219200,2,1404,5.378995433789954

947945,5,6304972857,"This 1998 movie adaptation of Charles Dickens' 1861 novel is set in contemporary Florida and New York.

The translation includes making some changes to the characters:

In the book, Pip becomes a gentleman whereas in the film Finn is set up by a mysterious benefactor to become a successful artist.

Dicken's tragic spinster Miss Havisham wears only her wedding dress after being left at the alter. In this film, Miss Dinsmoor changes her clothes and forces Finn to dance and draw for her - in a way developing his talents.

The fugitive Abel Magwitch becomes Arthur Lustig.

There were two scenes which were particularly heartbreaking. The first is when Miss Dinsmoor succeeds in using Estella to break Finn's heart. In trying to exact revenge on the male sex, Dinsmoor realises she has wounded an innocent man. Her remorse, sorrow and regret are truly palpable.

The other is when the successful artist Finn runs into Lustig, the convict he helped as a boy. This cumulates in a revelation which had me break down and weep.

The film is beautifully shot and features lots of excellent artwork. I especially like the setting for Miss Dinsmoor's house. It is really otherworldly and surreal, conveying the eccentricity of the inhabitant.

So much of the book is distorted and left out that it's only vaguely familiar. But let's focus on what it is. I think the angst and tension rely on three things: the old lady is completely crazy; the girl is utterly beautiful and captivating; the boy is captivated. Bancroft as the old lady is amazing. I thought she stole the show. You can see her fixation and motivation. I thought the movie was most interesting when she was on screen. Paltrow as the young girl is a total miscast. She's not beautiful or captivating. She's just weird. She manipulates with sex and has no feelings. She's actually quite repulsive. I felt sort of sorry for her that she was used as the old lady's pawn, but she is not really a good weapon because she's so weird and inept. The boy is kinda sorta captivated. He lives his own life, does his thing and goes in and out of periods where he's obsessed. The Florida and NY backdrops create vivid pictures of life. The boy's ""step-father"" and sister add realism to the story. So the movie has highs and lows. All and all it's a lukewarm sort of film.",1322870400,,1199,4.381165919282512

To the seller's credit, a full refund has been issued to us and we were told to keep this other version with Gwyneth Paltrow.  Even at no net cost to us, this DVD was a waste.

This 1998 movie shamelessly rips off the Dickens' classic tale of Pip, Estella, and Miss Havisham.  The story is so well depicted in the Ioan Gruffudd version that the contrast to this mess is stark indeed.  Since the selling mix-up noted above, we have been able to view the Gruffudd version (on an old videotape) and found it just outstanding.  What a shame the DVD is out-of-print.  Another reviewer suggests waiting for BBC to re-master and re-release, so that's what we will do.

Back on the Gwyneth Paltrow production, my wife and I found the other reviewers to be unduly kind in their comments.  Maybe the worst part was Robert DeNiro's role as Pip's benefactor.  Aside from using the F-word in virtually all his dialogue, he comes across as a mean-spirited, criminal with no redeeming features.  When he's knifed in a New York subway there's little to be sorry about.  At least we wouldn't see him again.

As a boy in a small Florida fishing town, Finn meets Estella, a pretty, but cold and distant girl who becomes Finn's complete obsession.  Years later, as young adults in New York City, Finn and beautiful Estella meet again.  Finn's passion for Estella fuels his ambition to succeed in life, and he believes his success will draw her closer to him and ultimately win her love.

As a modern reader, I understand that several elements and plots in Dickens's novels nowadays are anachronistic and cheesy at times. But I still recommend that young readers should read these classics for other reasons - eg, to appreciate the difficulty of breaking ""thru"" the class barrier at another time in England. In contrast, this modernized version of ""The Great Expectations"" is unforgiveable in its modern plots and cheap marketing ploys and is not worth the time watching it at all. Under the pretense of erotica and arts, the usually great Paltrow stoops so low when she takes off her clothes for some cheap soft porn shots along the light weight Hawke. It's painful for me to watch the movie.

948155,5,6304972857,"This is a great makeover (not  a remake) of the English 1946 black and white film which was much closer to the Dickens original both in time and setting when it begins:  South East England just after the end of the  Napoleonic Wars and the Thames Estuary where one can discern the floating  hulks of pensioned off warships stripped of  masts and rigging and turned into holding prisons for felons awaiting  transportation to Australia. In this  1998 version the time is the late twentieth century and the setting is the shallow waters of the  Gulf of Mexico  off the  South Western Florida coast, faraway from the more fashionable Florida Gold Coast on the Atlantic  Ocean side.

Any filmmaker today who dared to  remake the 1946 film would be doomed to failure as it would  be a hard, if not impossible act to follow. Having said that  the newer  film is a gem precisely because the producers  did not make that mistake and for a score of other creditable  reasons as well, not least the superb cinematography and soundtrack. It is as if a builder were told to  reconstruct a beautiful aging  mansion  but  to keep the facade and the basic structure while having  complete liberty to do whatever he felt best for the interior. The 1998 film is therefore the modernised version of  Great Expectations, probably close  to what Dickens would have actually  written had he been alive today.  The filmmakers have preserved  much of the novel's structure and a little of  the facade but have gone to incredible lengths to  put a new stamp on it, with considerable success.

Let me say that  the much esteemed 1946 black and white English movie had its faults. John Mills who played the part of the grown up hero, at 38 was really to old  for the part. Also while a 17-year old very  lovely Jean Simmons played  cruel young Estella to perfection, Valerie Hobson as the older Estella was  a terrible miscasting. The 1946  had Alec Guinness in his first actor part in  movies (he was merely  an extra in a 1934 film) looking  much younger than his real age. Unfortunately, the supporting role he played in the 1946 movie has been eliminated from the 1998 version.

For  no reason that I can explain the  1998 producers decided to change virtually all the characters  names. The hero Pip becomes Finn, the prisoner, formerly Abel Magwitch, is now  reduced to Lustig,  etc & etc. I would have trashed my DVD if  they changed Estella's name, fortunately they had the sense not to do that.

The opening and closing scenes in the new movie  are in the Gulf. Finn (Pip) is set upon by Lustig , admirably played by Robert de Nero with his wonderful elastic features who has been hiding beneath  the shallow waters off the Gulf coast. As the there are  no prison ships floating around  one has to imagine how he go there. What immediately follows is pretty well by the book, it would have to be a otherwise it would be another story. Finn dwells in a shack with his  elder sister and her ex- fisherman boyfriend Joe (name unchanged).  The  trawl fishing industry has died and Joe ekes out a living by mowing lawns and other odd jobs. In Dickens Joe is a blacksmith, but an odd job man in the newer movie. Such a fellow in the 1990s  would as likely have had  a bolt cutter handy  as  a blacksmith would have a file in the 1820s. Equally useful  tools for an escaped  prisoner to release himself from iron shackles.

In Dickens the sister is  ugly and unpleasant  but  an honest homemaker, in the new version she is an attractive  slut who moonlights as a prostitute. In Dickens she dies , in 1998 she just  disappears.  In both versions Joe is a simple jolly fellow who likes his young charge.

Finn (Pip) falls n love with super rich  young  Estella  when he is  sent to be her playmate  in  the old dilapidated mansion where  Ms Dinsmoor  (Miss Havisham) dwells. The original Dickens recluse is more distraught than evil but the 1998 Dinsmoor is aggressively nasty and conniving , a role  played well by  the late Ann Bancroft. While in the new version  one glimpses for a  second the remnants of the wedding feat that never  happened it does not  feature as much nor the darkened  dining room as  in the earlier version where the rather pathetic woman spurned at the altar still wears her ragged white  wedding dress decades after. In contrast Ms Dismoor is quite stylishly clad  and her long term  plot to induce Finn to fall in love with Estella is more  immediately evident.

New York City  replaces London as the venue for Finn (Pip)  after he meets a lawyer  who informs him he has an unknown benefactor who has Great Expectations of him. Everything  Finn needs to make his success as an artist in the Big Apple will be provided only the name of his mysterious  patron cannot be revealed ( back in the  1830s Pip is making his name as a young law man but we have to have  a plausible  reason to see Estella in the nude). Of course , while in New York Fin bumps into Estella  (as Pip does in London).

The grown  up Estella is  played exquisitely  by the very versatile actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who looks convincingly like a grown up version of the younger girl Finn used to  play with. (A  truly wonderful shot in the old  mansion  shows the transformation of the dancing  pair  from children to young adults in a single twirl). Most  filmmakers since the  1980s  have felt obliged to have  nude scenes and soft porn love making  embedded somewhere if there  is  a romance going on  so this version of GE  is no exception. All I can say is  that the lurid scenes are very tastefully done, it's the most of I've seen of Ms Paltrow in the buff  since  watching Shakespeare in Love (another 1998 movie). She  has a body that men dream about , even if her features are rather plain, but she is certainly  more attractive, even when clothed , than Valerie Hobson in the same role back in 1946. I still have not made my mind up about Ethan Hawke as Finn. Is he really that gormless looking-almost to the point of idiocy-  or was that just for the part? Nevertheless, he plays the role fairly well. The character is supposed to be a bit nave, more believable of somebody whose career goal is to paint rather than one who wants to  follow law.

Of course, Lustig (Abel Magwitch) shows up in towards the end, as in the book, but  in entirely different circumstances.  In the book  and  the 1946 movie  his final scene is in  a prison  hospital after a futile attempt to escape the police. In 1998 it's in a subway car after trying to flee with Finn  from some mobsters who are after his blood.  In both case the dying prisoner reveals that he is  Finn's (Pip's) benefactor as a reward for the only kindness that was ever shown him back in the Gulf (Thames Estuary).

In both  movies the final reconciliation between  the hero and Estella occurs when they meet by chance back in the grounds of the  old mansion  which is about to be torn down. Unlike in the 1946 movie and the  novel  the vengeful  recluse is reported to have died and does not suffer  the dramatic and grisly end  shown in the earlier movies.

Let it  be.  Either the original version or the reconstructed one make a great story whatever one's expectations. The professional film critics canned the 1998 version for no valid reason. The usual  banal credo that any movie produced in  the  1930s or early 1940s no matter how hammy the acting, is a classic and must merit four stars and any attempt to make  or make over such movies in the 1990s  merits only two stars at best (excrementas bovinorum!).

Even if the 1998 version was a flop, and to my  mind it was an amazing  work, it would have been redeemed at least partly  by the superb cinematography. The 1946 film did a  great job with black and white film which used to be the  normal standard for  dramatic movies with Technicolor more often chosen for comedies, westerns or musicals.  The  1998 film makers have done wonder with  their box of colours  and sound tracks. The opening scenes and credits  instil the very essence of salty tidewater with the lettering waving around as ifin motion  the ripples on the surface of the sea.

Joe's homestead  shack is set in a decadent Western Florida jungle, all shabby but  picturesque  poverty with lush sub-tropical vegetation, the call of birds and the  endless monotonous clicking of cicadas. With Spanish moss dripping from tree boughs. Al this  is very evocative , one can sense  the inherent  dampness, the heat and  humidity  seeping in and almost smell the pungency old wood, rotting fish  and the  tangy salty smell of sea marshes and tidewaters. I have seldom seen a movie that can convey so  much  sensuality purely by sound and vision.",1213747200,3,8700,4.510996119016817

Now that I have not only read the book, but teach it at GCSE I decided to re watch it. I'm afraid I have to agree with some of the comments here  - the film completely failed to engage my emotions. There was none of Dickens's characterisation and humour, which was why the romance was no more real than a kiss in a glitzy music video. I admit the film was visually stunning, but the script was really quite uninspiring and the characters flat and one dimensional. I know it was supposed to be modern, but sometimes people do say clever / funny things even in this day and age - I think Miss Havisham's comment about her cat eating other cats was about sum total of witty dialogue! Joe's forced 'carefree' laughter and Bently Drummel's total failure as a villain were also particularly trying!

I tried to pinpoint what I found particularly annoying about this version of GREAT EXPECTATIONS...and then it came to me; there was nothing about any one character for which I felt a single shred of emotion! I might as well have been Estella herself! I freely admit that even Dicken's original story is my least favorite of all Dickens' novels. I have seen three other film adaptations and still did not particularly care for the story or the characters (here the names have been changed as well as the time and the country).Perhaps Ethan Hawke, who plays the ""Pip"" character,Finnegan Bell, was my biggest objection to this film. I found him to be 100% lifeless,uninteresting and not at all an embodiment of understanding and kindness. With your lead character being so terribly portrayed, the story really never jelled for me. Gwyneth Paltrow as Estella, on the other hand, fares much better as the ice cold and victimized Estella. She seems to understand her character's tragic upbringing and the sexy allure with which she has been educated by Nora Dinsmore (a somewhat odd and uneven portrayal by Anne Bancroft).

I found the New York shots to be totally implausible. Where does anyone walk in New York TOTALLY ALONE on bright,gorgeous sunny days in Central Park West???? Come on!!! Where do leaves cascade down alley ways tucked far,far away from any living green thing??? (I understand the symbolism, but this simply doesn't work with New York City).

The design for the Dinsmore house never once changes over the years of neglect! The same vines that entwined the house when Finn was a young boy on his first visit are exactly the same as when he arrives years later. Vines grow!!!

This entire film was so implausible,senseless and uneven in production.

Patrick Doyle's original soundtrack seemed to me totally incorrect for the sensibility of this adaptation. He must have still been in his Kenneth Branagh mode!

Based in the Florida Gulf Coast and Manhattan, NY; this movie is a series of stories embedded one within the other, each one about a relationship involving the protagonist, Finn.  The first relationship is already set before the movie begins, and that is his relationship with his older brother-in-law who takes care of him when his parents die.  The second relationship begins the movie as we see Finn's infatuation with drawing, specifically drawing birds and fish while wading through a tide pool.  Soon after comes the story of his relationship with Arthur, an escaped convict who at first threatens him, but then befriends him.  Fourth  is his infatuation with and obsession over Estella, a beautiful girl with a heart of ice.  Fifth and last is his unofficial apprenticeship under Nora Dinsmoor, an eccentric old lady with money to spend and the time and privacy to indulge her dreams and nightmares.  Together, these five relationships would determine his life and control his every thought and action.  But they are not inclusive and to satisfy his relationship with one, he must give up another.  He does this, only to regret it later on.  This then is the moral of this story, one cannot have everything in life,  regardless of how hard you try.

Would his mysterious transformation change him enough for her to overlook his humble beginnings? (No..)  Why was she teasing him in this strange, cold way?

Unfortunately, these reviews unfairly criticized what is a fine film and one that faithfully recreates the central themes of the book.  Let's face it, in many ways, Great Expectations can be a dreary book.  The many plot twists and turns, while typical of Dickens, merely provide a framework for the core concerns of  the book: class inequities, the allure and dangers of retribution, the pain of unrequited love, the human heart's capacity to harden itself, the conflict between the environment and the innate, society's willingness to sacrifice its children, and the power of loyalty and forgiveness, to name a few.  This adaptation deals directly with these issues and forsakes unnecessary plot devices.  Remember, Dickens published his novel serially for a public who anxiously awaited new installments and wanted many of them.  A modern film audience has no interest in such prolonged dramas.  This movie wisely does away with what it does not need.  And yet, many of the criticisms point to these omissions as evidence of a failed narrative.  What these criticisms reveal is their critics' misinterpretation of the novel's strengths and misunderstanding of modern cinema.

One of the best things about the books was its constantly twisting and turning plot, but its complexity, I would think, makes it a very difficult story to adapt on film. This version focuses mainly on one aspect of the novel, the relationship between Estella and Pip (or Finn, as he is called here.)The film is different enough that it should be considered a separate story. The tale of Pip and his social climb is updated, which really isn't the problem because it is such a classic story. Except Pip is now an artist, which provides the most likely way for someone from a poor Florida fishing village to quickly become a wealthy member of the New York City elite.

Visually, the movie is beautiful. The color green is everywhere: the color of money, the color of jealousy, or maybe the director just likes green. Miss Havisham (called Miss Dismoore in this movie) and her mansion are everything you could imagine from the orginal book, just in a warmer climate. As far as the characters go, Anne Bancroft gives an incredible performance as Miss Havisham/Dismoore--vicious and weird and delusional. The actors are all very talented, and the cinematography is lush, but the longer the movie goes on, the less developed the storyline gets. Not enough time was spent on explaining events or further devloping the characters' relationships to one another because too much time is spent on Finn and Estella's cycle of sexual longing and emotional abandon. The ending, while faithful to the novel, does not provide any answers to anything. Those who have read the book can guess why things turned out the way they did, but a film should be able to tell a story on its own.

This version of Great Expectations feels a lot like a foreign film, with its story of complicated love and its artistic visuals and music. It feels like the director of this movie is in fact a European or possibly Latin American filmmaker, and probably an accomplished one. People who love foreign films would enjoy this movie, or at least appreciate it. But overall, it has a lot of potential at its beginning, and by the end, it's just weak.",1123027200,10,2247,4.700507614213198

A true love story about a young boy who eventually grows up still searching, still dreaming of the love that left him. Chasing her around, he meets her again, to only show yet his love for her. Beautiful but yet realistic sense of love, though rarely seen, the movie brings out what we often forget the difficulties of love. Ethan Hawke does a great job portraying the character of Finn, as well for Paltrow for Estella.

Pip, called Finn in the movie is cast as an artist from Florida whose benefactor sends him to New York to become a great artist. His love interest in Estella (played spectacularly by Gwyneth Paltrow) is expanded to include some steamy scenes: Finn painting her naked, and later having sex with her, which go far beyond the scope of Dickens' book. It all culminates with Finn and Estella on the beach of Ms. Dinsmoor's house coming together at last (which is pretty close to the book). One must approach this film as a modern adaptation of a classic book that does not aim to replicate the text by the numbers, but rather by the heart of the story. As such, the film has value when taken in that context. It must also be noted that Robert DeNiro's subway scene, when he reveals to Finn that he is his benefactor, is one of DeNiro's best performances. Truly moving! That said, this film is worth more than a cursory viewing.",1102550400,6,1030,4.5133689839572195
948503,4,6304972857,"With a sensational cast, haunting music, and great cinematography, this modern adaptation of Dickens's novel is far more fun and far more provocative than the original, however much one might like that novel.  Set in a contemporary Gulf Coast village in Florida, Finnegan Bell (Ethan Hawke) is brought up by Joe (Chris Cooper), the lover of his sister, who has abandoned them both.  A working class boy with a love of fishing and a gift for artwork, Finn is ten when escaped murderer Arthur Lustig (Robert DeNiro) surfaces one day while Finn is out exploring tidal pools.  After helping him, Finn later forgets him.

Finn eventually meets Nora Dinsmore (Anne Bancroft), the richest woman in town, and her niece Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow), whom he has been hired to visit every Saturday.  When Estella goes away to school, Finn loses touch with both of them, until, years later, he is suddenly invited to New York to show his artwork.  A mysterious trust supports him, and he reconnects with Estella and all the other characters from the past.

Director Alfonso Cuaron and screenwriter Mitch Glazer have created a modern story of obsession and revenge.  Nora Dinsmore, who was jilted on the day of her wedding, thirty years before, has been training Estella, over the years, to tease and then destroy the men who love her.  Anne Bancroft plays Nora to the hilt as a funky and exotic caricature, heavily made up, carrying a cigarette holder and martini glass, while gyrating to erotic music and chanting ""Chick-a-boom.""  DeNiro is a vicious Lustig, and his first appearance is a shocker.  Ethan Hawke, as Finn, does a good job, though he is hard pressed to hold his own when the rest of the cast is camping it up.  Paltrow, as Estella, is coldly calculating in her sexual teasing, and lacking the vulnerability one expects.  Chris Cooper, as the sympathetic Joe, provides the perfect foil for the other characters at key points in the film.

The lush cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezky) features Spanish moss, the eerie and dilapidated old house of Nora Dinsmore, lovely scenes of tidal pools and wild nature, and the hot New York art and caf world.  The director and producers have chosen nine different composers, ranging from Tory Amos to Iggy Pop, to create appropriate music for a succession of very different scenes, and they succeed in creating a haunting mood and atmosphere.  Though the ending is abrupt and trite, the cast is terrific, and the film is great fun, especially in its contrasts to the Dickens novel.  Mary Whipple",1096070400,4,2531,4.889929742388759
948504,4,6304972857,"I went into this not expecting a lot.  But from the very first few frames I was drawn into the story.  Yes, I have read the Dickens novel in High School.  Contrary to some, I kinda liked the book.  But you could totally ignore the Dickens angle and enjoy this film.  That being said, I was highly amused that the director chose Florida as Pip/Finn's boyhood home.  The setting and the further choice of the Florida fishing culture brought a depth to the story I did not catch in the novel.  New York City as the ""big city"" may have been a clich; but then New York City is the center of the art world as far as America is concerned.
Mr. Hawke may have the misfortune of being paired with great actors in almost every scene in this film.  Because of this, I believe the talent and ability he brings to the film may be overlooked.  For the most part, Hawke is on screen with either Anne Bancroft, Robert De Niro, Hank Azaria, or Gwyneth Paltrow.  Although the story is supposed to be about Pip/Finn, our focus flows away from Hawke to any one of these actors.
Gwyneth Paltrow is a pretty woman but she is not fantastically beautiful as others would have her.  I think this actually works to her advantage in that her beauty does not overshadow her personal charm.  This allows her magic to actually work on the audience. Much is made of the nude scenes in this film; but the truth is that very little is actually shown.  It is more suggested than revealed.  But their effect is very electric.  More effective are the surprised kisses of Hawke and Paltrow over drinking fountains.  Simply the ""best"" kisses I have seen on film in a long time,
Most of us lose patience with great works of art dressed up in modern garb.  For the most part, Shakespeare in space suit costumes is not nearly as interesting as many in the ""creative community"" seem to believe.

Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n presents some stylish and gourgeous sceneries, locations, people and music, yet the plot is still by-the-numbers, failing to convince despite some pretty and well-crafted moments.

948506,4,6304972857,"Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow star as Finn/Pip and Estella in this modern day version of the Dickens' classic. Director Alfonso Cuarn and 20th Century Fox do a wonderful job in this updated color version.  Cuarn's modern day adaptation to ""be careful for what you wish for"" begins in a lower economic 70's Florida Gulf Coast fishing town. Here we meet a young Finn, a child artist who meets an eccentric elderly woman and her niece. Anne Bancroft does an excellent job playing the eccentric, jilted, Miss Dinsmoore/Miss Havisham. Because she has been left at the altar, Miss Dinsmoore poisons the mind of her niece Estella such that her niece will never feel the pain of a broken heart. Moreover, Miss Dinsmoore encourages Estella to go out into the world and toy with men's affections, rejecting them before they have a chance to hurt her. Thus, the stage is set for Finn to fall in love with the enchanting Estella and to be rejected by her.
 Oddly enough, a strange and mysterious benefactor allows for an older Finn to go off to New York to pursue his dream of becoming a rich and famous artist. Finn believes that with enough money and fame he will be able to win Estella's love.  Alas, Finn falls victim to all of the trappings of life in the big city and loses sight of who he was and the humble fishing town where he came from.
While the film is modernized from the original version including a soundtrack that is used artistically to reflect the moods and characters within the movie, the movie stays true to Dickens' original story ending, as it ends with Finn and Estella holding hands while gazing out upon the ocean.
The movie has a great deal of emotional depth.  Many directors rely on a great deal of explicit imagery (fluff - sex and explosions) to bring the film to a wider audience.  Great Expectations delivers a great story without including fluff.  The two scenes that gave this movie its ""R"" rating were very short and necessary to complete the plot and necessary in order to modernize the original Victorian tale.",1077062400,4,2039,4.634349030470914

948508,3,6304972857,"Remakes are risky business.  Director Alfonso Cuaron's modernized Great Expectations proves the point.  Charles Dickens' engaging, heart-warming, and admittedly plot-manipulated classic fares less well in this glitzy adaptation.  Ethan Hawke plays Finn (Dickens' Pip) in his rags to riches rise from Florida fisherman to New York artist.  But his character lacks depth.  The same is true for Gwnyeth Paltrow's hard-hearted but bewitching Estella.  The ""minor"" but veteran players eclipse both in the film.  Ann Bancroft plays a convincing Miss Dinsmoor (Miss Havisham), Estella's jilted guardian.  But Robert de Niro steals the show, just as does the money, as Arthur (Magwitch) the escaped convict.  The novel's involved and coincidental story line is perhaps to blame, since the script allows for little character development in the lead roles.  Still, director Cuaron finds time for some gratuitous sex scenes, hoping to grab a risky enough rating (R), to seduce young viewers into the theater.  (Dickens would have raised the dickens about that!)  The cinematography, at times an excessive eye candy, does please, however.  And the film does entertain in a syrupy way.  That said, Great Expectations suffers from (what else?) great expectations - arising from headline actors cast in a predictable film.

948582,4,6304972857,"Great Expectations 1998 is a moody, colorful, exciting and sexy romp through the story originally penned by Charles Dickens over a hundred years ago.  The characters of Estella and Pip are updated, as played by Gwenyth Paltrow and Ethan Hawke, to today's sensibilities.  It's not done badly either.  Anne Bancroft as the ecentric great aunt to Paltrow's character is a force to be reckoned with.  I got the feeling that Bancroft was ""doing"" another actress in acting her part - it took me a few minutes and then I realized that she was playing the part as Ruth Gordan would have played it - and looked.
All in all the film isn't bad.  It's got its really sexy moments and its tense moments and its heart warming moments - just as did the original.  And the mystery of who is Finn's benefactor is still there.  However, Dickens' story is more than a two hour film can hold.  Some of the really wonderful nuances that are in the story are forced out due to time constraints.  It doesn't really hinder the story, but if you know the original story, the film seems rushed in places.
In fact, I would have ranked the film higher if it hadn't been named ""Great Expectations,"" because it's not really the whole story.  It would have been more fun to update it as has been done and then name it something else, giving credit to Dicken's famous novel.
Hawke (whom I really dislike on a regular basis) is quite good in this film (to me, he always looks as if he needs to bathe - yet, here he looks nicely scrubbed and clean).  His Finn is a likable and beleivable ""Pip.""  Paltrow doesn't do badly either, but her character really isn't as three dimensional as it could be.
Check this film out and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  Just don't expect to be able to watch this film instead of reading your English Lit assignment and expect to get the same benefit.",1047427200,,1844,4.4523809523809526
948583,4,6304972857,"Argualbly Charles Dickens' most accomplished novel ""Great Expectations"" has much to offer; social satire, comedy, thriller, and romance.  If you want most romantic film version of this beloved novel, you should watch this one.
Mexican Alfonso Cuaron changed all the settings of the original more radically than in his previous work, excellent ""Little Princess.""  Pip, a lonely boy who is raised by his sister, is now called Finn, who draws pictures for a beautiful but cool girl Estella.  Yes, as in the novel, Pip/Finn encounters this woman of fate in the garden of deserted house where eccentric Ms. Dinsmoor (= Miss Havisham of the original) lives her secluded life.  There is no muddy marshes of Rochester, England, but the place is changed to Florida, USA, and Finn, who is raised by kind fisherman Joe, unexpectedly gains a chance to be an aspiring artist in New York with a help from unknown benefactor.
The plot change may dismay some fans of the book, but David Lean's acclaimed version of ""Great Expectations"" has also changed its ending, so let's not talk about it.  Cuaron intentionaly dropped all the satrical aspects of the novel so that we can be immersed in the world of romance between Ethan Hawke's Finn and Gwyneth Paltrow's Estella.  Both actors hold the center of the romancic relationship well, and we have good help from Anne Bancroft (a bit campy Dinsmoor) and Robert DeNiro.  And you also can witness then comparatively unknown Chris Cooper's wide range of acting.
But the greatest merit of the film comes from the team behind these actors; the dazzling photography of Emmanuel Lubezki (""Little Princess"") gives life to the director's trademark color green, and Patrick Doyle (""Sense and Sensibility"") provides fantastic score for the scenes.  And most of all, we must remember the name of the real painter of Finn's drawings, Francesco Clemente, whose uniquely sensual style infuses power and authenticity to the character of Finn.  (If you want to see this hugely talented Italy-born genius, watch ""Good Will Hunting,"" where he appears briefly as a hypnotist.)
Naturally, this kind of interpretation of classic novels can be risky, and ""Great Expectations"" has to pay some price.  The film loses its momentum a little in latter half, owing to less amount of romance seen in this part -- this is one of the rare cases in which New York on screen is not as fascinating as it should be.  And because of the story's twist concerning DeNiro's character, I am afraid that some may be led to doubt the artistic values of Finn's pictures.

948585,5,6304972857,"Sadly, when it was released in January of 1998, Great Expectations failed to make a significant dent in the box office.  I suppose it was a case of poor timing. It came out in the wake of ""Titanic,"" which was the love-story/date movie of the year.
This is most unfortunate, since this is one of the most beautifully filmed, richly detailed pieces of cinema to come along in quite a while.
Dickens fans, be warned! This is not at all a clear adaptation of the novel. Many liberties are taken and many of the the names are changed.  Perhaps this is why it works so well.
Director Alforso Cuaron uses the novel as merely a template, and then lets his imagination run wild.  Unlike Baz Luhrman's contrived and pretetious ""Romeo and Juliet"" just two years before, Cuaron does everything in his power to stress the fact that this is not ""Charles Dickens Great Expectations,"" but rather a film that is inspired from one of the greatest works of English literature.  Sure, there are weaknesses in the adaptation, but the whole thing is so aesthetically appealing that it hardly matters.
The cast here is solid: Hawke, Paltrow (looking better than ever), Anne Bancroft, De Niro..There are also excellent supporting turns by the likes of Chris Cooper and Hank Azaria.  it also boasts a tuneful and fitting contemporary soundtrack.
The real star of this is Cuaron, though. It is amazing how a director can use various images and colors to convey such a wide range of emotions. Cuaron uses film like artists use canvas, and here it clearly works.

""Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Pawltrow really shine together"", and with great performances from Chris Cooper, and Anne Bancroft. This movie is an instant classic.

948727,4,6304972857,"Any modern adaptation of a classic novel always seems to get a bad press from some corner, no matter how good it is  Having had the benefit of reading the book I can firmly say that I absolutely loved this adaptation.
The story, whilst perhaps different in detail retains much of Dickens's original themes.  Hawke plays Finn, a simple fisherman until a mystery benefactor turns his dreams of becoming a a young woman who has been emotionally stunted by her bitter Aunt Dinsmore.  The problem is, now she's engaged and has a whole new life all of her own.
Many people may complain about the fact that the movie focuses more on the couple's romance (or lack of it) rather than that of society that Dickens expressed in his novel.  However, it is still true that this really was the centrepiece of the entire story in the first place.  Anyway, the world of law and business of the book is perfectly transformed into the fickle art world that Finn enters into.
The acting is, quite simply, sublime.  Hawke plays Finn well enough to make us understand his judgement, either good or bad.  Yet it is Paltrow who really shines, as she is every bit the Estella of the book - mysterious, beautiful and sorrowful all at the same time.  Crucially she delivers one of the book's key monologues comparing her situation to a girl who is afraid of sunlight with a tearful logic that is just perfect.  The rest of the big name cast do well too, with a gloriously over-the-top Anne Bancroft and a menacing Robert DeNiro as Magwitch.
Cuarn directs the movie with great style, bringing real beauty to the tragic lives of the characters.  On top of that there is a truly amazing set piece in Miss Dinsmore's overgrown mansion.  It all flows along magnificently, transforming all of Dickens's themes to modern day with a panache that it is certainly unusual of most movies moving classic literature to modern day.",1019520000,4,1891,4.648648648648648

948729,5,6304972857,"I love this Sexy remake of Dicken's classic ""Great Expectations"".
Paltrow and Hawke sizzle as the more modern version of Estelle and Pip.  The story line is basically the same as the classic, with a few modern touches. Ms. Dinsmoor, played by Anne Bancroft gives one of the best performances of her career, even considering her brief role in this film (She reminded me, oddly, of Bette Davis in ""What Ever happened to Baby Jane?""). I truly found myself looking at her pitiful character through the dismal light of insanity, much like her jilted-lover counterpart, Miss Havisham.  This tale of poor Boy meets rich, heart-breaking Girl is timeless, often reminiscent of ""Wuthering Heights"".
 I particularly enjoyed certain surprises such as DiNiro as the escape convict and the whole movie taking place in NYC.  Very original ideas and concepts renew this old favorite love story.  Where was Anne Bancroft in 1998 when the Academy Awards rolled through?
  Perfomances by the entire cast were notable as well.

Gwenyth Paltrow was every bit Estella; she was equally painfully beautiful and coldhearted. Ethan Hawke also played an excellent Finn/Pip. The scene where he stands drunk outside of Estella's apartment and gives the ""Everything good in me...is you"" speech still comes vividly to mind. Plus, ""Estella's Theme"" (the guitar instemental that plays in the movie and over the main menu screen) perfectly chacterized every wonderful, longing moment of this film.

I do ask that the interpretation respects the feel of the original and is true to its spirit
This travesty does neither.
The classic yarn is updated to 1980's Florida and New York,and in particular to New York art society circles. We still have the childhood meeting between the young hero and an escaped convict,we still have the rise of the working class boy to fame and fortune thanks to a mysterious benefactor,we still have the eccentric recluse and her daughter with whom the hero is in love
What we don't have is any subtlety or restraint in the visuals merely a regular diet of soft-core couplings set to instantly forgettable songs and a syrupy string score
What we don't have is even an approximation to a decent performance,even from normally reliable performers like De Niro,Paltrow and Bancroft(her performance indeed is simply dreadful,proceeding with a plethora of mistimed lines and over-emphatic gestures,that had me pining for Martita Hunt's performance in David Lean's bastly superior forties version)
It looks like a Duran Duran video and about as empty of intelligence and weight
Leave modernising classics to people who do it well like Baz Luhrman,IanMcKellan or at a pinch Kenneth Branagh.
Do yourself a favour and check out the David Lean version instead
for a demonstration of what can be achieved by a director rather than a jumped up magazine photographer like Alfonso Cuaron who can make with the visuals but is woefully inept at storytelling with a camera",1008720000,8,1698,4.940559440559441

Hawke and Paltrow were mesmirizing. Anne Bancroft and Robert DeNiro both did a great job in supporting roles that were interesting and unique. The courage it takes to update a masterpiece, a classic of literature and bring it in to today' perspective is always challenging for actors.
I wish people would stop comparing constantly and not wanting anything to change. Sure I love period pieces, but that can get ""old"" after awhile if you will excuse the pun. It would be benificial if audiences would appreciate different renderings of classics. This movie is not the original story by Charles Dickens written in the mid-1800's, it is not intended to be. Yet it evokes the main message, it imparts the very same themes that Dickens was trying to convey. Certainly it is in vogue to compare and contrast and to deem the original book more clever, but not everone of this day and time is going to sit down and read Dickens.
If this movie can pass on the ideas of Charles Dickens to today's young audience or even encourage a reading of his literature, then the actors have accomplished a wonderful thing. We are entertained and awestruck by the powerful themes of the great master storyteller Charles Dickens 150 years later, but how can that message get out to today's masses out we modernize it? There are the purists who want to read the originals and that clearly is the best way. However, this is a story for the ages, for all to enjoy. Many of today's young people won't pick up a classic to read and enjoy it. The story can be made accessible to everyone and that is why I enjoyed this movie so dearly.

948857,3,6304972857,"This film  is loosely based on the classic Dickens novel.  Very loosely.
Set in modern times, it moves from the Florida Gulf Coast to New York with certain key elements familiar to readers of the original story.  There's a young boy who encounters a convict played by Robert DiNiro as a Mafioso. There's an eccentric old lady, played by a Anne Bancroft who wears brightly colored designer clothes, smokes cigarettes and guzzles martinis. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the icy young lady with cool detachment.  And Ethan Hawke is cast as the young man, a bit too much of a hunk for the role which is written to have him become the darling of the art world.
There's a lot of star power here, and some nudity, but not much else.  The script does not do justice to Dickens' intentions.  We've come to expect good cinematography these days and so I must say that the Florida gulf coast really did look good.  What is lacking, however, is the dark brooding atmosphere.
In some respects this is a pleasant video although it moves too slowly and never grabbed my emotions.  Gwyneth Paltrow does look pretty.  And Robert DiNiro gives an excellent performance.

Director Cuaron transfers his story from the misty and fog bound  moors to the sunny ambience of 1997-Miami. Funnily it works. Ethan Hawke as  Finn the central character and whos acting skills I had serious doubts  about manages to age effortlessly here from inadequate teenager to  confident but lovelorn adult. So maybe the man can act!. Chris Cooper also  does a wonderful portrayal as Joe, Finn's kindly brother-in-law, abandoned  by Finn's faithless sister he captures an image of pathos when he finds  himself out of place at Finns first gallery opening. A first rate actor who  is in no danger of being typecast. In the end Gwyneth carries the movie as  the distantly cold and enigmatic Estelle. She gives new meaning to  aloofness.

Textuality dictates that reciting the same story that was amazing in print will turn out contrived  and vacuous in celluloid.  It shows the spirit of Dickens' work -  completely loss in spite of danger, the loss of heart and being.  It's a  story that hinges on that great tragic moment in love which Romeo and  Juliet made so clear to us all (esp. in Shakespeare in Love).
The movie  is rich in narration and exploits a directorial narrative.  The ebb and  flow of visions, places, people, and unrelated occurrences turn into a  melange which has all the warped lucidity of one's best and most painful  memories.
The direction is fantastic as is the cinematography. The  greatest genius of this movie is the use of the hauntingly frozen Life in  Mono by Mono.  Regrettably, this portishead-ish band's other songs didn't  have quite the presence of this song that gave the movie its icy  ambience.
Especially loved the Dinsmore character.  Much more batty and  manipulative than the simply grotesque and warped Havisham of the  book.
Additionally, the recounting of Gwyneth (Estella) may seem flat and  one-dimensional; however, isn't that the way one remembers the players in  one's memories - as automata which reacted to us singularly in the stage of  life?

948973,5,6304972857,"""Great Expectations"" (1998)
 This film is a cinematic masterpiece due to its colorful scenes that seem to be painted onto the screen in a perfectly precise style.  ""Great Expectations"" is  rich with imagery and a wonderful story line based on Charles Dickens'  classic tale.  It strays from the novel enough to make the story a more  visual experience.  The time period is changed to present day, but this  adaptation works for the best.  It allows a modern audience to identify  with this classic tale in a way that would be impossible if the film were  set in the 19th century.  Finnegan Bell falls hopelessly in love with  Estella from the first moment he lays eyes on her and proceeds throughout  his life in continual pursuit of her love by attempting to become  ""worthy"" of her.  He is an orphan raised by his abusive sister  and her fisherman husband, Joe.  Estella is the niece of the richest lady  in the state, Ms. Nora Diggers Dinsmoor.  Ms. Dinsmoor requests Finn's  presence at her mansion, Paradiso Perduto, on a weekly basis as a playmate  for Estella and to entertain herself.  Ms. Dinsmoor was left at the altar  by her fiance in prior years and has become a bitter old lady who scorns  all men and believes none can be worthy of a woman's love.  She schools  Estella in this manner, which explains Estella's cold behavior and her  rejection of Finn as anything more than a toy for her to play with his  emotions.  The story is told through Finn's eyes and from his  perspective on what occurs as he grows up and learns about life.  He has  the ability to paint fabulously, a gift he has had since birth, and he uses  this gift to express himself and his emotions throughout his life.  It  becomes a road to success and to Estella, but he loses sight of his joy and  love for the art.  Success becomes a trap for him when he realizes that  there is more to life than himself and his own feelings.  He truly grows up  and even though he always loves Estella, learns what he wants out of life  and how to accomplish it.  ""Great Expectations"" is  wonderfully cast, with Ethan Hawke doing an extraordinary job as the  lovelorn Finn.  He is believable and invokes much sympathy from the  audience.  Gwyneth Paltrow is superb as Estella, who conjures some  hostility because of her rejection of Finn, but at the same time is capable  of evoking sympathy.  The way she acts is not her fault because she does  not know any better.  Robert De Niro puts in an excellent performance as  the escaped convict who scares Finn as a young boy and has a major  influence on his life.  Anne Bancroft is wonderful as the eccentric Ms.  Dinsmoor who acts out her hostility towards men through Estella.  This  film is one of the most picturesque and beautifully cinematic films I have  ever seen.  From the first scene until the last, each shot is carefully  stylized to make the most of the scenery and the story.  The theme of  Finn's paintings is begun in the opening credits, with his paintings as the  background and the credits appearing on the screen as if in rippling water.  Each shot is precisely stylized to evoke certain emotions from the  audience and to tell the story as Finn remembers it.  The film looks as  though many different paintings were put together to create a coherent  story.  The film is very peaceful, as seen through Finn's paintings and the  slow, romantic musical background, but at times is jarred to reality by the  people coming into Finn's life who influence him.  The film can appear as  if in a dream state while Finn is thinking about certain occurrences in his  life, but then an event happens that shows him just how large and  threatening the world is capable of being.  This gives him to a new  understanding of the world and his place within it.  This tragic tale  is given an optimistic Hollywood ending, but in my opinion, this is  appropriate.  It leaves some hope, even though small, of Finn reaching his  ultimate goal in life of finding himself and being free of the past,  ""like love, completely undeserved"".",939859200,37,4056,4.578651685393258

Much like the 60's updates of the classics, the  personalities, attitudes, and fashions therein belong so completely to its  own period that the passage of few years will be needed to date it  embarrasingly. Always intended as grist for the hedonistic masses (like  ""Titanic""), the film-makers make no attempt to break out of the  conventions of teen soapers. A sloppy job is done in unifying the script,  as--unlike in the original--the two stories of the girl and the convict are  not yoked here, and thereby rendering one or the other irrelevant. Dialogue  is dull and often banal. Paltrow looks anorexic. DeNiro is his usual  smarmy, hammy self. Attempts at humor are emetic.

949167,4,6304972857,"I have to admit, I'm one of the only Dickens fans  I know that actually enjoyed this retelling. For me, the intense focus on the relationship between Stella and Finn (Pip) urged me to re-read the novel for a fourth  time, in an entirely new light.
If you haven't read the book, it focuses  much more on Pip's ascendancy to success than on his lovelorn frustrations  with Stella.
Yes, concentrating on this relationship was a typical  Hollywood maneuver, but the outcome is the creation of an entirely  renovated sub-story, definitely one worthy of telling.
Modernized story,  great art, and an interesting soundtrack all contribute to a funky paradigm  of the original text. I loved it precisely because it didn't try to be the  book.
The direction is beautiful, the scenery is gorgeous. The only thing  that kept me from giving this movie five stars, was the sappy Hollywood  ending. Maybe they should have called this remake ""Great Expectations  Fulfilled.""",922579200,11,959,4.962264150943396
949168,4,6304972857,"Finn (Ethan Hawke) and Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow) may be the focus of this story, but Ms. Dinsmoor (the inimitable Anne Bancroft) really lit up the screen every time she appeared. Her over-the-top portrayal of the love-lorn  Ms. Dinsmoor deserved an Oscar nomination. This is a good movie for those  who love romance with a twist, and a must-see for Bancroft fans!",918259200,,363,4.934426229508197
