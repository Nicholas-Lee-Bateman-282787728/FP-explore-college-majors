The menus were easy to navigate, and the clean opening and closing were a nice bonus. The subtitles were accurate with few typos.

I would love to get the movies and Jump special in region free and subbed!",1455321600,3,362,4.027777777777778

8713458,4,B00WHZZ7HW,"Great quality to watch the show on, clear picture with accurate subtitles, for the most part.  Only misleading thing is the title that says collection 2 could be misunderstood as season 2 which it's not. It's just the second half of season 1. Episodes 14-25 of the 1st season of the show",1518220800,,287,4.519230769230769

8713461,5,B00WHZZ7HW,"i watched #2[yes did not see #1] as a joke bec i had no interest in volleyball+slam dunk was so amazing that i did not think this show
could top it. boy was i wrong. the editing of the slams & camera angles just blew me away. at first i thought the style reminded me of
animatrix's world record by madhouse. but checking the credits, Prod IG[which does GITS] was behind this anime. not only did PIG did
a wonderful job on improving it from the manga drawing style, but they borrowed a lot of angst EVA style into the oikawa character, the
villain/rival  to the hero team.

Angst? what do you mean? well they draw oikawa's eyes crazed/paranoid & then lifeless in his quest to destroy
tobio primarily & karesuna. One way to sum it up: oikawa reminds me of a psychopath+tom cruise[a perfectionist]. also i loved how he analyzed the strength & weakness of karesuna and tries to exploit his team's strength. I found this analysis of what works & what doesnt very informative in appreciating the gameplay in volleyball[as i had no interest in it]. also the relationship between oikawa & iwa[his best friend] is hysterical.
i personally think that story really picks up/starts in ep17 in disc#1 & rockets in #2. #2 is the basically the match between karasuna vs blue castle but PIG manages to incorporate a lot of backstory in flashback to balance the momentum in the matches. if one watches carelessly #2, it feels like it's
only about the game, but when you pay attention, you will notice the backstory which adds a lot of depth in re-playability.

well what about disc#1? watching #2  got me amped to watch #1 and it was good points ie the re-building of the karesuna via ACE[asahi storyline] & new coach[ukai] storyline but a lot of it is the SLOW buildup which leads the momentum in ep17+. In addition, i had already seen season 3 which is only 10eps but although pretty good but the more you watch season 3 you realize why #2 ep19-25 is so amazing[see 2nd paragraph], primarily bec there is no villain like oikawa in season 3.

the anime borrows a lot or owes a lot to slam dunk's hero. 1) hinaka is a redhead like hero in slam dunk 2) he is short vs tall but naturally gifted 3) hinaka is amazing in striking due to very high jumping ability & unending stamina but serves like beginner like dunk's hero[cannot do simple shots] 4)tobio is like rurawa in slam dunk gift as a natural player ala hanks solo 5) both make promises to tobio/rurawa that they will be best in japan & world

slight negs: 1) cannot turn off subtitles 2) no eng dub[not a big deal]. if company can charge lower price via not paying for eng sub is fine by me although eng dubbing has improved a lot since 2006[?] ie see NANA but jap male voice actors have gone to hell. watched in low volume. 3) songs for intro were terrible.",1482624000,,2797,4.453125

8713463,3,B00WHZZ7HW,"I really hate it when Sentai puts 12 - 13 episodes on one blu ray disc instead of the typical two discs. This takes the quality down a tad bit but most people probably don't care or can't tell the difference. I wouldn't mind so much if it was cheaper but it's not. It costs the same as the first set, which comes on two discs. This is why I love Aniplex. Although they're expensive, I never truly feel like I'm overpaying when it comes to Aniplex. That's because their quality and sound just can't be beat.
Anyway, 5 stars for the actual anime and one star for Sentai cramming all 12 episodes onto a single dual layer blu ray disc.",1477440000,,631,4.223140495867769
8713464,5,B00WHZZ7HW,"This turned out to be just as great as the first season! A little different, since season 1 laid the foundation already. But really, who'd have thought volleyball was actually such a game of skill and strategy? Plus, the characters are well developed and relatable. It won't leave you hanging.",1472601600,,293,4.88
8713465,5,B00WHZZ7HW,"Love this! I wish there was a complete 1st season collection instead of Collection 1 and Collection 2 of the 1st Season, but love this all the same. Haikyu!! makes a lot more sense to me than other anime. It shows will, determination, perseverance to improve oneself, and drive to succeed! Can't wait for Sentai to release the 2nd season.",1471910400,,338,4.65
