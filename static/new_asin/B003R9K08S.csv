4180977,5,B003R9K08S,"Directors Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell have done something remarkable here: They made an artful, thoughtful documentary about a potentially lurid subject.

In the '80s and '90s, a scary, primitive subgenre of heavy metal took root in wealthy, beautiful Norway.  How and why Black Metal was created, and how it suddenly exploded into a media frenzy as some of its practitioners started burning down churches and committing murders... that's what this film explores.

But it's all somehow handled with restraint, and mainly from the point of view of the musicians themselves.  There are interviews with many of the main players in Norway's black metal scene, including the infamous and eerily charming Varg Vikernes from his dorm-like prison cell, but there's very little performance footage here -- it's not a ""rock documentary"" in that sense.  In fact in a way ""Until The Light"" unfolds more like an art film.  To the filmmakers, Black Metal is an opportunity to explore how artistic intent and meaning gets re-interpreted and twisted by culture and media.  It's the ultimate post-modern tale.

That said, the film is gripping, full of fascinating and contradictory characters.  The soundtrack features hushed electronica by bands like Mum, the cinematography swings between gritty handheld stuff and composed naturescapes... it's an unusual atmosphere for a documentary.  If you're into Black Metal you're going to watch this movie anyway, but indie movie lovers should give it a spin too.",1283126400,43,1490,5.27542372881356

4181022,5,B003R9K08S,"If you are (were) not 'into' black metal, or know nothing about it, this movie will vaguely give you some idea of what it's about. Who cares, the documentary/narrative/informative part is only mildly interesting and at best the filmmakers deserve 3 stars. The best part, the 5 star part, about this documentary are the interviews in the movie and in the extras. Varg and Fenriz, when you really hear what they have to say, will really tell you what black metal was and what it meant when they made their music. Listen to the music, read the lyrics, then listen to them talk, it will really make sense; more than any book or magazine or whatever meaningless media there is on black metal out nowadays.

Also, this film is not for your average meathead metalhead or your average bible thumping christian. That should be self explanatory, considering the subject matter, but I guess I should throw that out there anyway.",1395705600,,917,4.73125

4181027,1,B003R9K08S,"I am a fan of Metal music and i was really looking forward to seeing this documentary and now that i've finished watching it i feel that it was a waste of my time and the reason is because this documentary covers no new ground,fans of Blackmetal are already aware of the information that is presented in this film its been covered and offers nothing new,and not trying to hate on Norway but there are plenty of other countries making Blackmetal! it would be wonderful if someone would make a documentary about that instead of rehashing the same old same old.",1387843200,,558,4.534653465346534
4181028,4,B003R9K08S,"For some reason, I find this movie has a calming effect on me. It's partly the introverted introspection that marks most of the guys who are interviewed here, and it's also partly the soundtrack, which has less of the highly-aggressive Black Metal that most people think of, and quite a bit more of the atmospheric stuff. But as soon as I begin to relax watching Fenriz, up pops Varg Vikernes, who is utterly terrifying, possibly a ""perfect-40"" psychopath.

What I find most interesting is the insight you get into what it is to be Norwegian. It's such a communal culture, and people like this--the nails that stick up--get hammered down. It's no surprise that a thing like Black Metal would take root in a place like that. It's their expression of rebellion. (Fenriz even says something about how he loves the art of tired and privileged Western bourgeoises.) But then taken a step further into murderous criminality and hate crimes.

Anyway, it's not about teaching you facts or trivia (though the Fenriz lecture in the bonus material is brilliant), it's about getting the feeling of the thing. Black Metal isn't all aggression and violence. It's a sort of appreciation--or at least, examination--of the darkness of things (sorry for sounding like one of those silly goth kids). You also get a feeling for how completely seriously these guys take themselves. Anyway, I really recommend it.",1382832000,9,1391,4.94017094017094
4181029,5,B003R9K08S,"I'm not going into this much; I loved this movie!!!! It covers everything that has to do with Black Metal!!!

His face is blanked out but his voice is there!!!!! Black Metal....Until The Light Takes Us!!!!!",1381190400,,401,4.911764705882353
4181030,5,B003R9K08S,"This documentary is a beautiful example of how to tell an insightful, menacing, dark and sorrowful story. These stories, however, are not fiction. They are real things, that happened to real people. That's what makes it either really tragic, or really great. This goes from the rise of black metal as a statement of rebellion and youth, to what many consider the fall of black metal, into what is now almost commercial or a ""scene."" What was once brutal and terrifying, and almost mythical, became accessible to everyone for any reason. It has become so accessible, that we now have parodies of the legacy, and (dare I say) POSERS who are undoubtedly destroying the obelisk of what black metal really is.

Rare interviews with Varg of Burzum, Fenriz of Darkthrone, and Hellhammer of Mayhem (among others) make the stories told even more compelling. This documentary is a true DOCUMENTARY. A collective history told by those who lived through it, and are around today to tell the tales. Everything from friendship, to hatred, suicide to murder, troubles to triumph, and the story of a rebellion that became an army. Ignore what you thought you knew of black metal. It's not all awesome... sometimes it was tragic.",1380844800,5,1212,4.912195121951219
4181031,1,B003R9K08S,What should be a very interesting topic turned into a snoozefest for the most part. I am a metal fan and was greatly looking forward to this documentary. There are far better documentaries on this subject out there. Look for anything by Sam Dunn.,1379894400,,246,4.613636363636363
4181032,4,B003R9K08S,These guys are brutal! The cultural differences only explain a small part of why these guys are so nonchalant about their actions.  Psychopathy is the only thing that can possibly explain the rest!,1377216000,,197,4.96969696969697
4181033,5,B003R9K08S,"A very interesting look into the creative talents that drove the black metal scene in its early incarnations.  The interviews with Varg Vikernes are particularly interesting, as well as a look at footage from the era.",1376524800,,217,5.027777777777778
4181034,5,B003R9K08S,"Who doesn't like a good show. I was so impressed. I was glued to it. I heard about the metal monsters from Norway when it happened. What I heard was nothing like what really happened. Go figure, the media controls how they want us view the word. God what a story! There is a reason this happened. It saddens me what cooperate America has taken away from the countries that were so unique.  Sad that my child will never know what it was really like.  Great movie! I can relate to this. In the effort to try and stand for individualism they lost so much. It was a sad story that history repeats time and time again.",1376265600,2,613,4.230769230769231
4181035,2,B003R9K08S,"I wanted to see this documentary because I think the story surrounding the early Norwegian Black Metal (NBM) scene is interesting not because I am a big fan.

For starters, I was a bit perplexed by the choice of music in this documentary. It is supposed to be about NBM right? Then why did the filmmakers chose the Icelandic plink plunk electronica band Mm for the soundtrack. If you are not familiar with Mm, they sound like an electronic band for small children, sort of pretty, non-threatening and irrefutably nothing like NBM. I would think some sort of heavy metal would have been more appropriate?

Perhaps the one thing this film is heavy on is wasting time. There are endless establishing shots of Norway, so many one might say, they cease to be establishing shots and the film just became a Norwegian travelog with some NBM musicians in it.

Of course there are quite a few interviews with several of the key (surviving) players from the original scene but the narrative is convoluted at best. I wish the filmmakers would have interviewed someone other than just band members, it would be curious to hear non-insider viewpoint on the scene (i.e. music critics, law enforcement, church officials, family, producers, engineers, landlords...). Varg is the most well spoken and by far the most engaging and is to thank in this film for carrying the historical narrative of the movement. The other main character, Fenriz, is illuminating occasionally but becomes tiresome, or perhaps, he was just asked boring questions (which wouldn't surprise me). These guys (particularly Varg) have/had an extreme view on the role of music, art and religion in European/Norwegian society and some of this comes through but not really enough to tell the story. It feels more like the filmmakers are gently poaching fish rather than creating a documentary about a group that wants/ed to eradicate Christianity from Europe.

My other major pet peeve with this film is how much time is wasted on visual artists Bjarne Melgaard (mostly) and Harmony Korine. Why? Who cares if someone is making art about this? Does it add gravitas to the importance of this music? The answer is no. NBM changed the landscape of hardcore, I don't need a painting to prove that to me. Actually instead of showing Harmony Korine dancing around LA's Patrick Painter Gallery why didn't they interview him???

What this all boils down to is, this film is not anywhere near as interesting as it could have been and in one word the film felt lazy. What is abundantly clear however is the history of Norwegian Black Metal is fertile ground for a gripping documentary.",1375315200,,2626,4.892134831460674
4181036,1,B003R9K08S,"I was looking forward to this dvd being available for sale for awhile. When I finally received it in the mail I couldn't wait to watch it. But by the time I got it Varg was already released from prison and his interview in this documentary was really why I wanted this for in the first place.
 So what I ended up with was an almost entire dvd narrated by a man named Fenriz from the band Darkthrown who looks like a longhaired skinny rat with bad tattoos who I have no interest in and turns out to be the most boring black metal artist I've ever heard interviewed.
I only wanted to hear from the man considered to be the most infamous artist in black metal history, turns out he's not only infamous he's intelligent, humorous, controversial and NOT A BORE. He's got a lot on his mind and a lot to say .
 All they needed to do to make this a great documentary was to point the camera at him ,turn it on and let him speak. What's so hard about that?
 Another part of this mess I thought was a waste of time was when Frost, the great drummer from the great band Satyricon ,cut himself up in what was suppose to be some kind of performance art. He must have did this for the money why else would someone embarrass themselves like this otherwise?
Hey Frost, stick to drumming, enough with the so called art, besides, don't you get enough attention playing in Satyricon and ain't  you getting a little old for this sort of thing?
My recommendation is if you want to know what the history of black metal is read all the various sites on the internet from all the important artist involved in the creation of this movement back in the day ,verify that the info's correct cause there's a lot of misinformation out there , and put together your own conclusion of what happened back then. You will then have your own more interesting and accurate documentary than this could ever have been without the bore and stupid performance art that tried to turn a piece of trash like this film into something interesting.

4181037,1,B003R9K08S,I think only fans of this type music and these bands would find it interesting.  The film makers take a very passive approach to telling this story so it is mostly monologues by the characters in the movie.,1372377600,,206,4.421052631578948
4181048,5,B003R9K08S,Great movie people believe is black metal is satanic occult music and culture but in reality they had their reasons for burning churches Christianity ruins cultures.

4181055,3,B003R9K08S,"I didn't expect this video to have so much Varg in it. However, if you fast forward through his prison rantings you will get to the most fascinating footage of the musician/artist ""Frost"" and the interest of the fine art world in black metal. I like how the black metal, dark side, occult is now being represented and explored in the fine arts. I wish there was more on this. I think this would make the Norwegain artist Edvard Munch proud! I like how Munch's ""the Scream"" and the screaming corpse painted face of a black metalist is compared. There is no Gorgoroth on this DVD though the package promises this. That was pretty disappointing. There is a focus on the deceased members of Mayhem of course, and some of their first album, but not anything about Mayhem today. Do they still exist? Who are the members now without their forefathers? You will not find out in this DVD. This video mostly focuses on the past, and through the eyes of Gylve and Varg.",1361923200,,958,4.511494252873563
4181056,2,B003R9K08S,"Surely someone could make a very interesting documentary about Norwegian black metal.  But this movie falls far short.  There is no rhyme or reason to the sequence of scenes in the movie -- it's an incoherent, slow-paced mess.  The film-makers did not make any attempt at organizing the information into some kind of coherent story.  I struggled to finish watching the movie.  Part of the problem lies with Gylve ""Fenriz"" Nagell, who is the main subject of the movie.  The man is inarticulate and, frankly, not very bright.  Much of what he says doesn't make any sense.

My advice is to skip this movie, unless you are a die-hard fan of Norwegian black metal.",1359849600,,659,4.719298245614035
4181057,4,B003R9K08S,"This documentary is not what it seems. Sure, the backdrop is Norewegian Black Metal but the film is really a character study of some of the originators of this genre and their musing about life, music, friendship and - of all things - art.

Lots of talking heads but that works fine. It was absolutely chilling to hear Varg Vikenes talk impassionately from his prison cell (he has since been released) about his murder of 'friend' Euronymous. But what was even more worrying is the man's political theory about the individual and his abhorrence of weakness. National Socialism was born out of such ideas. In fact it was not only Varg who seemed to be 'all for the individual'. I was horrified by the admiration that some spoke of when a gay man was murdered by one of their group.

It was also fascinating to watch the lonely 'Fenriz' (who has the most onscreen time in the film) wandering aimlessly around like a sad bastard - squirming while watching the playback of Varg talking about him (two friends who are friends no longer) and looking bemused attending a Black Metal art exhibition.

I watched this with my 18 year old daughter. We were both interested in and appalled by these men. It is a film that really makes you think about music/art and the people who make it. And you don't need to be a fan of black metal to enjoy it.",1359590400,,1335,4.508264462809917

The camera work was shoddy, the interviews were short (with poor responses, to boot), and the audience is given very limited perspective outside of a single band's view of Metal and the heritage which inspired it.

Again, this would probably appeal much more to fans of the genre. People interested in the culture may not gleam as much from the film, however.",1356825600,,561,4.656565656565657

4181072,5,B003R9K08S,"I cannot say enough good things about Until the Light Takes Us.  Black metal is such a maligned, complex, and misunderstood genre that I would imagine it was difficult at best to sit down and try to make a comprehensive film about its origins and present condition.  This documentary succeeds, and how.  Instead of being pompous, overblown and self-consciously ""scary"", as other efforts have been, it steps back and takes a subdued, neutral look at the genre from birth to modern day, mostly letting the musicians themselves spin the story.  As other reviewers have said, this is not a typical ""rockumentary"" and very little concert footage is shown; this is more along the lines of an art film.  The soundtrack involves less black metal and more mellow Scandinavian electronica, which to be honest I was not wild about, but it's a minor point.  The conversations with Fenriz, Varg and (to a lesser extent) Frost were thoughtful, revealing, and sometimes intense.  The understated detachment of Hellhammer makes an excellent impact presented in such a way.  All these conversations are punctuated with footage of the majestic Norwegian wilderness and suffuses the film with a dense, heavy mood.  The second disc is full of deleted scenes and a ""black metal 101"" class with Fenriz, which is really charismatic and fun.  Basically, this film is clearly a labor of love, and it is intelligent, beautiful, and extremely worthwhile.

4181076,5,B003R9K08S,"This DVD is essential.  I honestly shouldn't write more than a paragraph or so here, because to do so would be to either judge or provide facts and/or opinions which could be used to form judgments, and that is exactly what the directors here go to extremes NOT to do in their documentary.

You will not hear a narrator.  You will not hear the interviewers ask questions or provide comments.  You will not hear background music composed for the sole purpose of this documentary.

You WILL hear from a small handful of Norway's ""fathers"" (for lack of a better term) of black metal, in particularly Varg Vikernes (Burzum), Fenriz (Darkthrone), Faust (Emperor), and Hellhammer (Mayhem).  You WILL hear some music composed by these bands, particularly Darkthrone.  You WILL see original newscasts of the misunderstood acts.  You WILL hear contrasting opinions on topics such as Euronymous's shop, the muder of Euronymous, the purposes behind the church burnings, and Americanization.

Rarely does the public get such a straight-from-the-horses-mouth perspective on subjects that have spawned such controversy.  This is especially true in the case of black metal as you will hear the ""fathers'"" feelings towards the rise of Satanic black metal that followed the movement in the time of the ""fathers.""

On a final note, I strongly urge buyers to get the two-disc edition.  With it, you are getting more than TWICE the material on the one-disc version, and to be frank, one who is interested enough in this subject matter can't get enough of it.",1326153600,3,1538,5.0355731225296445

I think my thoughts have been expressed by other reviewers so let me move on to why I'm writing this review at all.

I first saw this movie on Netflix Instant video, and obviously the quality was Youtube equivalent. Thus, I wanted to get a version which has superior quality. I was considering the DVD version but decided to go up to the bluray version since all of my other bluray movies really stand out from their dvd counterparts. Not so in this case. The bluray version of this movie is a joke. It looks just a little bit better than the streamed version I saw, and some of the image quality was horrible. I'm talking about picture so bad it had large blurry pixels at times. I would barely call this version DVD quality, let alone HD. I was very disappointed.

So, great movie, horrible HD version. Buy it for sure, but make sure it's the regular DVD version.",1322438400,,1071,4.431472081218274
4181095,1,B003R9K08S,"I stopped watching this at 45 minutes in--I couldn't take the clown paint, pointlessness and dogma seriously. I went in with a somewhat open mind, trying to allow myself to grasp or even minimally comprehend the attraction to this ""art form"" or ""lifestyle"" or even perhaps gain an ounce of understanding. But, why should I? When it is apparent that the likes of Varg and the lot have no desire to understand or even tolerate particular races, orientations, or walks of life. What they succeed at is painting themselves into the very corner of that which they claim to despise--they all look the same, talk the same, play the same and blindly follow their disjointed beliefs just like a swarm of Christians going to church on Sunday. Extreme isn't the answer to extreme. Violence, anger and hatred are the hallmark of fear and ignorance--always. After awhile, all I see is a bunch of pasty little boys who got into sis or mom's make-up and decided to use images of horror and demons to try and exorcise their own. Incredibly transparent. Whether one is a Christian, Jew, black metal enthusiast or what have you, burning down a piece of history (destruction for destruction's sake) will never be justified or even begin to make any kind of progress or point. It is something that an angry, frightened, unoriginal, limited man-child would do. I suppose if I had been born and lived my life in Norway, I would become oppressed/depressed as well. But to make a statement, or a mark, one has to look somewhere else besides the edge to gain credibility. All extreme behavior manages to do is to garner a fleeting moment of notoriety. It says absolutely nothing in the long run. There is nothing unique or interesting about homophobia, racism or misanthropy. What is interesting to me, is that most fundamentalist religions share (some) exactly the same prejudices that these ""death metal"" (oh, excuse me: ""Black Metal"") goons share; I don't think Varg and the boys have stopped to think about how much they truly resemble their nemesis.

This one was by far one of the best.  The interview with Varg about the murder is quite disturbing.  My opinion is that the filmakers left some things open for interpretation for the viewer.  I'm sorry to see the one star reviews on this.....just remeber the majority of these things happened almost 20 years ago.  People grow up, change their points of view, and move on in life.  I would recommend reading [ASIN:B0051UYAMI Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground New Edition]] book first before watching this film to give some background.

4181099,4,B003R9K08S,"Since its beginning, rock n' roll music has suffered - and benefitted - from the stigma that it is somehow evil. If you wanted to make the case against rock n' roll, Norwegian ""black metal"" music might be exhibit A. As with many rock musicians, black metal bands weren't content just to sing about debauchery - they lived it. What set them apart was just how far they went: burning churches, committing suicide, and murdering each other. Until the Light Takes Us is an excellent look at a disturbing sub-culture. The filmmakers try not to tell the viewer what to think, so you have to find the answers for yourself.",1307577600,,615,4.6
4181100,2,B003R9K08S,"The Norwegian black metal scene is ideal documentary material. It's got that unrestrained Grand Guignol sweep: murder, violence, dramatic grandstanding, artistic pretension, colourful characters, shocking and objectionable political statements, and an overall strange and unworldly atmosphere, sometimes expressed with interesting music. For a film-maker, this should be low-hanging fruit. Just tell the story the way it happened, and the audience is all yours.

Well, they tried. Until The Light Takes Us gets close to many black metal veterans, particularly Fenriz of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darkthrone/dp/B00009KU70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darkthrone</a>, as well as the infamous Count Grishnakh, in prison at the time. To their credit, the film-makers refrain from any heavy-handed commentary or moralizing, even when things get pretty grim with the burning of the Fantoft stave church. Instead, they present a montage of newscasts covering the events, effectively showing the sensational controversy that surrounded the scene without adding to it.

Unfortunately, the film-makers are not very good at film-making. It's not entirely their fault, most contemporary films and documentaries are like this -- fragmented, with far too many cuts, reducing the interviews to disconnected sound-bites and damaging the narrative flow. For example, the film seems to either omit or gloss over the fact that both Euronymous and Count Grishnakh were in fact members of Mayhem. Rather, the film merely describes Euronymous as a record store owner, then cuts to some description of Mayhem, then cuts to the feud with the Count. If you don't know the connection, this may seem more jarring than it is.

The film covers the timeline, the controversy, and even the people, but it has almost no time for the music. Casual viewers may be forgiven for thinking that this is because the music was unlistenable, irredeemable. The brief audio clips heard in this film are indeed quite rough, without the context that might help to understand the style. (Before his suicide, Dead was respected as a vocalist -- might have been a good chance to play some of the few surviving recordings and try to see why.) Fenriz briefly demonstrates how bands tuned their guitars and tried to play fast, but this explanation is soon interrupted by a cut. But forget about that -- the most interesting thing about black metal music was that many musicians tried to break past its limitations, often in very unconventional directions. For example, the film is named after a Burzum&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/album/dp/B003U9NAD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">album</a>&nbsp;(not mentioned in the film), which has three songs in the usual shrieking style, but closes with a long, somber, atmospheric instrumental on keyboards, inspired in equal measure by classical and ambient music. A later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/album/dp/B00002754O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">album</a>&nbsp;consisted entirely of these minor-key instrumental pieces. To this day, black metal inspires bands like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agalloch/dp/B00006FSST/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agalloch</a>&nbsp;to combine loud guitars with folk and classical instruments, the better to convey their vision of primordial nature. At the very least, this is worth discussing. If it was really all about church-burning, murder and lo-fi screaming, there wouldn't be much point in making a documentary.

The directors choose to emphasize very odd things. We might not hear a lot about music, but we do get many long shots of Fenriz from behind, as he trudges through the mean streets of Oslo. He is amiable and witty when he talks on camera (his phone interview is hilarious), but these endless silent walks are a waste of time. The directors are also very fond of some guy who runs various art exhibitions with black metal themes. This guy frequently pops up to shower wordy praise on black metal musicians, but he himself is not a musician, and has no connection to the original scene. The art exhibits are not very interesting or relevant. The primary medium of black metal was music. There was a visual aspect, too (all that face paint), but the exhibits aren't about that, they're about things like writing profanities on canvas.

Perhaps the film-makers have an art-school background, and their way of ""elevating"" black metal is to connect it to something that they respect. And in a way, they succeed! The sight of Harmony Korine prancing around in face paint with a stupid wig undeniably makes Count Grishnakh look like a learned statesman and scholar, in comparison. Unfortunately, I think the film means it with a straight face, as an illustration of black metal's influence. Instead, however, it merely shows that the image can easily be co-opted by clowns, and offers no insight into the original intent behind that image. If they really wanted to make a case for black metal as art, they needed to focus on the music.

Because of all this, the film seems to peter out without saying anything. A pity, because this isn't just one of those cheap jobs trying to cash in on all those sensational headlines. This film really tries to take its subject matter on its own terms and say something about it. It just needed better editing and presentation.",1306454400,18,5479,5.65127582017011
4181101,1,B003R9K08S,"This is my first review, and I'll be brief. There is little to no historical, cultural or musical context to black metal or metal in general in this 'documentary'. Some of the interviews are good, but because the framing of the genre narrative is so void, they lack a more well rounded understanding in terms the overall purpose. Connecting the music to ideas of modern art is a bit of a stretch, and at certain points completely ludicrous (I'm thinking of the stupid tap dancer here...). By the end of the documentary, it all feels very much like just an hour and a half back story for a particular painter's exhibit that they show later on. I'm a huge black metal fan, as well as a metal scholar (somewhat...) and was very much looking forward to it.  Awful. I was horribly disappointed and I know several other metal fans who hate this movie. Beyond this, I find the title itself to be somewhat insulting and missing the point of black metal and what many of these people are talking about.

4181102,1,B003R9K08S,"Fifteen years too late, and nothing new. Varg's interviews were interesting, but way too much time was spent (wasted?) on Fenriz and Frost - two aging harmless teenagers screaming from the shackles of the enemy for any kind of attention they can grasp before 'black metal' washes away into the Mists of Misnomer. I fast-forwarded through much of it (especially the Fenriz and Frost sections) and this seemed to make this documentary slightly more watchable. Varg is one of the most confused people I've ever heard. He goes on and on about how alien the Christian faith is to Norwegians, so he believes in Norse fairy tales... He's also a hypocrite. He burns down alien Christian churches because they aren't Norwegian... so why doesn't he record all his records using just Norwegian instruments? The guitar, bass, amplifier, and microphone were all invented or developed/improved upon by Jews... yet he hates Jews... If he's such a Nordic purist why isn't he using the goat horn, willow flute, and Hardanger fiddle on all his hypocritical recordings?

4181103,4,B003R9K08S,"Ok, the movie is great, I have no qualms with it at all.  This is more about the limited edition 2-disc version I just pulled out from my box (hehe) and viewed, listened to, touched, smelled, and would taste if that wasn't totally uncanny.

The DVDs are beautifully packaged, in what appears to be a newer type of plastic clamp system (instead of popping the disc out, you go ""down and up""). DO NOT FORCE THE DISC OUT NO MATTER HOW EXCITED YOU MAY BE TO HEAR FENRIZ TALK FOR AN HOUR.  You will break it.  While the package is minimalist and sleek, it is constructed almost completely out of paperboard, so wear and damage over time is a possiblilty.  The artwork, however, is breathtaking - the disc covers resemble little Polish paper cuts, or the cover of an Agalloch album (think slate purples and grays, with black animal silhouettes).  A very informative booklet sits inside without any individual housing pocket.

One of the greatest things about recieving this was that there was a sticker on the shrinkwrap stating ""4 Extra Hours of Black Metal.""  How often does one see that?  While some of the extras are neat, like most cutting room slag, the viewer understands why it was left behind.  The extra footage is wonderfully organized by band, so fans can navigate through what they want to see easily. BTW there was a TON of Enslaved and Ulver footage that didn't make it in (lame). We also get to see Fenriz create a ""History of Black Metal"" bubble chart on a chalkboard, but alas being raw footage it is incredibly lengthy and at times boring.

Of course metalheads around the world have been yapping on about ""Until the Light Takes Us"" for the months prior and after its release, but this movie is so artfully  and cleanly done that I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in music subculture and, without thinking this a stretch, world cultures.",1299369600,26,1865,4.635258358662614
4181104,3,B003R9K08S,"Well, this will be a quick review: ""Until the Light takes us"" isn't a bad black metal documentary inasmuch as there are interviews with a couple of icons in the scene, nevertheless, they don't mention other key facts in the scene such as extreme right wing point of views (despite Varg Vikerness is part of it and, in some way, the one who actually opened that gate in BM). In addition, while Fenriz and Vikerness are icons in the scene there are other people who played an important role in the black metal development, I'm talking about group members in Bathory, Emperor, etc

In conclusion, if you've been into black metal for a while, you'll enjoy the documentary although you may agree with my opinion.

4181116,5,B003R9K08S,"I'm an avid fan of black metal, and basically all types of metal. I've followed it closely for many years so I know almost all the ""ins & outs"" of the genre. I've also seen practically every black metal documentary or movie released. What makes this one stand out for me are a few things. First, this was released in theaters around the world, albeit limited cities. It features rare interviews with ""elusive"" characters such as Kristian ""Varg"" Vikernes, Gylve ""Fenriz"" Nagell and Jan Axel ""Hellhammer"" Blomberg.  They rarely grant interviews and haven't appeared in documentaries prior to this one, perhaps Hellhammer appeared in on documentary but briefly.  So this film has a sort of ""exclusive"" feel to it.

What shocked me most is the misguided anger of so many Norwegian youths during the early 90's and how much I DISLIKED some of the personalities featured here. I'm  very big fan of black metal, from many countries and undeniably from Norway as well and I never thought I would see them as ""terrible"" people despite the infamy. With Varg, you see a man who loves to victimize himself. He expresses how American culture became embraced in Norway as he grew up. That in his hometown of Bergen he saw the first McDonald's there open amongst other ""bad"" American companies popping up around Norway and pretty much everywhere around the world. How Christianity erased Norse/Pagan culture,etc. Supposedly these are the roots of his misplaced anger and rebellion.

First thing that you'll notice with Varg is that he's a very well spoken, charming, intelligent and even humorous guy. You don't get how this guy could be so deranged that he murdered someone in cold blood and committed various forms of ecclesiastical arson. But everyone has two sides to them and some display it much more than others. With Varg it's very obvious. He is no doubt THE most fascinating person featured in this film. He's been in prison for a long time and it's almost impossible to get anything from him. In some ways his band Burzum had an almost ""past tense"" like feel about it because he was out of commission for a long long time. But the things that make his music great are also what make him a bad person. He's an egotistical, arrogant, confused, contradicting, racist, prideful and hypocritical person. I don't believe even he knows why.

His explanation of the murder to make it look like Euronymous of Mayhem tried to kill him first was pathetic and sounded like he was just echoing what his lawyer told him to say. The truth of that story was revealed in other documentaries by other people close to them. Euronymous was no better a person than Varg up until his murder. He encouraged his band's lead singer ""Dead"" to kill himself and took pictures of his corpse with his head blown out. He ran a record label but barely had any money to pay the bands on it. He was possibly an even bigger egomaniac than Varg and he apparently made plenty of ""death threats"" to people he disliked or wanted to get out of his life or black metal community. While others have taken that as a opportunity to walk away, Varg took it as real threat. Someone said ""you don't make threats to Varg and expect him to go away quietly."" While that may have been the case, I also feel that Varg felt extreme jealousy and hatred towards Euronymous. Jealousy for being the ""godfather of black metal"" and the man who ran the show amongst the black metal circle. Hatred for the fact that while Euronymous talked a big show he didn't really walk the walk. Varg considered himself more ""true"" because he stood up and did things against society while the rest ""talked"" about it. He burnt churches and another killed a homosexual for pretty much no reason outside of homophobia. These men were considered ""the real deal"" in the circle while the leader ""did nothing"". So the comtempt was evident.

Which leads me to Hellhammer (drummer of Mayhem) who smiled and expressed ""respect"" to Bard Eithun (ex-drummer for Emperor) for killing a homosexual man because he made advances towards him. I couldn't believe he said it when I saw it and I just thought ""what a scumbag!"" I mean killing any person in cold blood is wrong and never deserves positive reinforcement from anybody. He really lost my respect and he could have used that moment to express disdain towards that particular incident. But he chickened out.

Fenriz supplied some much needed light-heartedness in the film. He's a very down to earth, seemingly genuine fella. From what I saw he simply just lives life like any normal person. His band Darkthrone haven't performed live since 1996 and uses it not as a form of income, but release from everyday life working in a post office. While I'm sure his band supplied him with enough money to live a luxurious lifestyle, he lives in an apartment and goes about life as if he's living from paycheck to paycheck. A very grounded person indeed. His story isn't as controversial or as intriguing as Varg's but a nice addition. You could almost say that this is the video companion to the book covering the Scandinavian black metal culture ""Lord Of Chaos"". Immortal's Abbath and Demonaz are featured unfortunately briefly in the film. But Abbath captured the general consensus of Varg Vikernes. ""He f**cked up. He must have gotten a rush doing what he did. But now he's in jail and that must suck for him."" Well said Abbath, well said.

Lastly, for the film to be truly perfect they needed to interview more people like Infernus (Gorgoroth), Gaahl (ex-Gorgoroth), Manheim (ex-Mayhem drummer), Ihsahn (Emperor) and Attila (Mayhem). They would have given us much more insight on the scene in the early 90's in Norway. But since anything covering black metal is scarce this is a must get, despite the flaws. Get the 2 DVD version as it has an extra 4 hours of footage and not aired interviews with Darkthrone's Nocturno Culto, Enslaved's Grutle Kjellson and many others.",1295136000,9,5927,4.746601941747572
4181117,1,B003R9K08S,"...that tells us nothing new about the 25-year-old genre of black metal. Other than the fact that a)Varg Vikernes is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is, and b)Fenriz is, perhaps, smarter than he at first comes off.

  The film largely alternates between interviews of Norway's most infamous nut-job Varg ""Count Grishnackh"" Vikernes (of the one-man band Burzum)and Darkthrone's drummer and creative force Fenriz. As with ""The Lords of Chaos,"" the nonfiction book about black metal that came out a few years ago, the creators of this film allow Vikernes to hijack their work with hours (in both the movie and the extras)of contradictions and incoherent political views, which are often outrageously nationalistic and racist. He rants ad infinitum about the conquest and conversion of his forefathers by the early Christians, never once acknowledging the violence and destruction visited upon foreign lands by the Vikings. He asks us to believe he murdered Euronymous because he feared for his life after Euronymous allegedly told others that Vikernes needed to die as a result of some feud over royalties and/or political and musical beliefs - this despite the fact that Vikernes insists repeatedly that Euronymous was all talk and no action with respect to church burnings. So Euronymous is a wimp, and nothing but talk when it comes to arson, but a man of action when it comes to actually killing someone? Elsewhere Vikernes brags about kicking and abusing a female Chilean grammar school classmate because she didn't belong in Norway. This convicted murderer decries Capitalism, saying it's practitioners have no respect for life (that's a joke, right? Wrong), then proceeds to criticize his society's ""socialism,"" saying it needed to be destroyed (by burning churches?)before it could be rebuilt. Vikernes is a guy who thinks Capitalism is evil, but forms his own record label so he could make more money from his royalties -some artists do this for creative freedom, but not Vikernes; his only concern, according to him, was money. He insists the church burnings were a form of provocation to wake people up to his political and religious views, then seems genuinely surprised that this extreme and destructive form of ""speech"" inspired copycat crimes by immature youth (hello? you're a metal musician, who did you think your audience was?)who made it all about Satanism. He complains that youth are given ""no direction"" in his country, when HIS actions were all about rebellion and bucking social/religious conventions. (Etc, etc. I could go on for untold paragraphs on Vikernes' senseless ramblings.)

  All of this would be fine if a)any of it was news to anyone remotely familiar with black metal. (And for those who are not, the material would probably be mostly unintelligible.) But Vikernes has been spouting this nonsense for decades. And the interviews with Fenriz and just a few other black metal musicians offer nothing more than tired lists of influences and self-congratulatory pats on the back for being so ""trve"" and ""cvlt"" b) Vikernes' viewpoints were challenged. Being fair and non-judgmental in a documentary is fine, but why not give another point of view, especially when a little conflict would add some spark to such a boring, one-sided narrative? THAT would be interesting: a knock-down, drag-out between articulate (and Varg IS articulate) passionate debaters who have genuine insight into how Norway's social, religious and musical milieu gave rise to black metal.

  ""Until the Light Takes Us"" offers no real insight into the deep and musically challenging world of black metal, is not artfully shot or edited, and has no pacing. And there is NO performance footage (other than a few poor-quality home video rehearsal clips) to break up the monotonous interviews.

  Imminently skipable.",1294876800,37,3820,5.183441558441558
4181118,4,B003R9K08S,"When I was a fifteen year old punk growing up in Austin, Texas, this thing called the internet completely changed the mode through which I, and so many others like me, were exposed to new music.  I know that Burzum and Darkthrone weren't creating their art with teenagers in the sunny suburbs of Texas who wore NOFX t-shirts, smoked pot, and waited anxiously for somebody to beat the LA Lakers in mind.  But, unfortunately for those guys, and fortunately for the legion of like-minded American youngsters, they were that damned intriguing that we took notice...and we had a hard time looking away.

Here is the interesting part; that was 1999-2000, so these Black Metallers from their tucked away corner of the globe were already entering their second decade as bands...or inmates.  Fast forward eleven more years to 2010 and we have overpriced picture books, parody albums, guest appearances, American kvlts, and even a few documentary films.

""Until the Light Takes Us"" is a lot of things, but most importantly it is NOT a journalistic expose into ""the intriguing and mysterious world of Black Metal"".  If anything, thank Odin, this film is a subtle middle finger to all those ""pieces"" that attempt to either exploit atrocity or over-intellectualize.  For too long outsiders, like myself, have had unauthorized license to make BM into what they want it to be.  But behind the veiled mystery are real people, real cultures, real history.  Black Metal wasn't spewed from hell upon us, it came about under very real circumstances.  ""Until the Light Takes Us"" puts those real people and circumstances side-by-side with the BS'ers who think they understand.

Through the words and actions of Fenriz (Darkthrone)and Varg Vikernes (Burzum, Mayhem), the audience is granted a most authentic look at two of the men behind this whole black metal thing.  I don't want to delve too far into the different attitudes and impressions of these two, as they've been pigeon-holed too much already.  I will say, however, that it is refreshing to see and hear these two rather than listen to narrators and record execs further remove them from who they are.

The strongest quality of ""Until the Light Takes Us"" is the lack of narrator.  Because of this factor the audience is able to watch the life of Fenriz and the story of Varg unfold at their own pace.  We are not told the same story through the same newspaper clippings and stock photos as we always have been.  What we see are two men remembering, coping with, and continuing on with the legacy of a small collective of bands that exploded into something beyond their control.

As a fan of both black metal and documentaries, I was prepared to bash this film, and for twenty minutes of it was disappointed.  It wasn't until I realized how much I liked Fenriz and Varg (not as FRIENDS, but as SUBJECTS) that I began to really enjoy it.  ""Until the Light..."" misses the mark in a few places, especially in it's failure to bring up Emperor.  But overall it is a very enjoyable and, dare I say, pleasant film to watch.  Four stars.

One last item; the ambivalence the film shows toward's Frost (Satyricon)as he makes some rather bold choices with his credibility is quite laudable.  The filmmakers let the viewer chose whether to be entertained or disgusted.  In other hands, Frost's portrayal would of been outright defamation.",1294531200,26,3363,4.8476357267950965

4181121,5,B003R9K08S,This is excellent.  The interviews are open and strait forward. This is a serious DVD that tells the true story of Black Metal. Both feelings and ideas are revealed with sincerity.  It is a very long DVD to watch but well worth your time.

4181122,3,B003R9K08S,"'A Decade Under the Influence' is probably one of my all time favorite documentaries. The same can't be said for Until the Light Takes Us (the rough English translation of Burzum's album Hvis Lyset Tar Oss), which is an 90 minute look at a genre of music that deserves at least 120 and at the most 180. Time is wasted, although it's only a few moments, watching Harmony Korine dance around like a doofus and Frost proving that Satyricon are pretty much a completely useless entity in the scene now.

ADUtI is such a great experience because of the length at which those involved are allowed to delve into the history and origins of the new American cinema of the late 60's and early 70's. Its obvious that Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell are big fans of black metal, but they seemed limited in resources and material; truly there has to be more than just the standard footage of the church burnings and Varg in court.

Fenriz, of Darkthrone, and Varg, mastermind behind Burzum, are more or less the two main interviewees and this is fine as both make for captivating material (especially Varg; you'd be hard pressed to find a more lighthearted, warm & fuzzy Nationalist Socialist.) but there are a few key players missing, namely Emperor's Ihsahn (maybe he didn't want anything to do with it) and the other people, namely Immortal's Abbath, who seems like he could have been a fantastic subject, are more or less wasted.

Then there's Hellhammer, the posterchild for closet homosexual. Doing his best to appear as tough as nails, even going so far as to declare a great deal of admiration for Faust's murder of a homosexual man, he just gives off the vibe of trying to overly compensate for a few things; namely being a drummer for hire. Then there's Frost who reeks of being nothing more than a devourer of attention; sad sight he is, really.

So, nothing new is learned by this seasoned veteran, but, like I said, Fenriz and Varg are interesting enough to warrant the film a 3 out of 5.",1288310400,2,1985,4.598870056497175

4181124,2,B003R9K08S,"Until the Light Takes Us (Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell, 2008)

Until the Light Takes Us has a surprisingly high IMDB rating as I write this (7.5 with 140 votes), and got a pretty solid dose of critical acclaim, including a very good review by MTV's Kurt Loder. I'm not sure what movie these people saw, but it wasn't Until the Light Takes Us, a movie that gives new meaning to the term ""incoherent"".

I think the original intent of debut filmmakers Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell was to examine the history of black metal through two of the genre's founders, Fenriz (of Darkthrone) and Varg Vikernes (of Burzum), tracing the split between the two and examining how that split has influenced black metal over the years. If so, it's a good idea, and it would have been a more focused film than most of the black metal documentaries I've seen. And we get some nods towards that idea; we spend most of the movie watching interview footage with Varg (affable, intelligent) and Fenriz (who has a slowness that conveys ""thoughtful"" less than it does ""wasted""), with added commentary from Hellhammer (the original drummer for Mayhem) and Frost (vocalist for Satyricon), with a few others. But then there's a whole bunch of unrelated footage that got throw in in for seemingly no reason (an art installation in which Frost stabs a couch before cutting himself, another in Los Angeles with Harmony Korine doing god knows what). And the interviews get off the intended topic on a fairly regular basis. The end result? A movie that covers a whole lot of ground that every black metal fan is already well aware of.

I hope, eventually, someone does it right. Until then, have fun with Bill Zebub's Black Metal: A Documentary or get a sense of the music from Roadkill Extravaganza (a document of Satyricon's 2000 tour) or get a much better, if shallower, overview from Once Upon a Time in Norway. This can safely be skipped. * ",1285113600,6,1911,4.678571428571429
8403358,4,B003R9K08S,"If you're into black metal this movie is awesome. If you are just a fan of documentaries it may leave you wondering why some scenes are included in the movie. As a fan of documentaries this movie left me with many questions. I also think because black metal is complex & the film makers had so much material they lost their way in the sense they didn't stick with one story line. This is most evident if you watch the extra scenes that did not make it into the film. Giving it four stars because even though I don't like black metal I am a metal head & I'm familiar with the subjects of the film. If not for that fact I'd give it three stars. Not a bad film, but I can't help thinking it could have been better.",1528934400,,711,4.085714285714285

8403361,5,B003R9K08S,"Having already watched this beautiful, haunting documentary twice digitally I bought the deluxe DVD. Why? Because it is raw, loving, full-spectrum view of the pagan-infused world of Norwegian black metal. It warrants multiple views. All the elements are here--some you may not like, such as deep-seated cultural supremacism and violence; some that you may find intriguing, such as an anti-Christian, pagan-centered view of culture; and some figures who are bereft of ardent politics and who focus on the beauty of thrash metal and the originality of the music. It's all here--look carefully. And you'll find yourself thinking about many of the personas in the movie, and questioning your own perspective. For metal heads, it's a must. For occultists, it's a crash course in a movement they must know about. And for people who are neither, it is an eye-opening journey down a strange rabbit hole. You'll never forget it.",1517184000,,919,5.174496644295302
8403362,5,B003R9K08S,"Very interesting.  A view of black metal based on interviews with two of its finest creators, Varg and Fenriz, with snippets from others as well.  Hellhammer is always funny (Euronymous was a commie and thus deserved to die - probably the best insight of the whole film).  The most interesting aspect of the movie is the how free Varg seems, despite being in prison, and how imprisoned Fenriz seems despite being free.  Varg seems to have embraced and accepted the past and thus is liberated in mind and spirit; Fenriz  seems to be haunted and trapped by the past - unable to make an album that doesn't rehash something from 20 years ago and financially trapped by the meagre lifestyle of a musician in an underground genre - and is trapped both mentally and spiritually as well as physically by the routine and the demands of work.

The bonus material is quite nice.  Fenriz seems to come alive during his 'history of metal' lecture and really looks to be enjoying himself as he is engrossed in his chalkboard flowchart of metal influences.",1517011200,,1041,4.686813186813187

8403364,2,B003R9K08S,"Until the Light Takes Us is a documentary that is so determined to get to a specific conclusion that it fails as being a documentary and becomes an advertisement for musicians of varying talent depending on your taste.

It's not without interest. If you don't know a lot about the black metal scene, you certainly get to hear some interesting stuff. Producers, musicians, and the founder himself Varg all show up to talk about the methods of making it. Varg in particular is ready to tell you about the ideas.

At this point, the documentary begins to fall apart and become much, much less. Varg and crew were accused of burning down historic churches that survived the church burning Nazis during WW2 and tons of other maybe events. Varg lets you know hey Christians are bad cause they ended the super awesome raping and pillaging of the old viking clans while also going out of his way with excuses of varying trustworthiness. Some of his stories sound like the worst lawyer defense ever.

I'd be fine with all this and his sad 4chan troll game if they presented any other view outside of Varg's and the community. They never do. They never even make the disclaimer that they tried to contact investigators, journalists, and others who would you know be from the other side. It's not hard to get people to go in for interviews. Politicians, police, priests, etc can't wait to get their faces up for all to see. It's natural human behavior. Essentially they chose to leave them out.

It changes the documentary into an advertisement.  Because of that the movie fails as a documentary. It also fails frankly as an advertising puff piece. As I said before, Varg and company come off as internet jerks who can't wait to tell you you're lame and they got all the answers. The most common thing to come out of all their mouths is to mention how awful western society is but never how exactly. They claim old viking culture is super important but they can't say how. I mean do they think the Swedes need to get back to raping and sacking English hamlets? They never say.

I wish I could give this a good review cause it's got great subject matter. The filmmakers here failed on fundamental levels though.",1505260800,,2199,4.611253196930947
