8696261,5,B00RY0KEBE,"Fascinating historical document and great restoration of damaged fragments of a deteriorated antique film--possibly the first ever documentary film in which Edward Curtis attempted to recreate traditional  tribal customs and rituals of the Kwakiutl tribe of the Pacific Northwest, using the device of a fictional love story to frame the dances and ceremonies he had the tribal members recreate from memory, after all such traditions had been outlawed by the Canadian government.",1484697600,,478,5.638888888888889

8696263,5,B00RY0KEBE,It is amazing that this epic video has been preserved and that the film was shot over 100 years ago.  My book club read the book The Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher by Timothy Egan and this movie was a wonderful conclusion to our study of Edward Curtis.,1458000000,,256,4.224489795918367

8696265,3,B00RY0KEBE,"I remember seeing clips from this film in documentaries and have tracking the origins of the clip for years. I was finally able to track it down to this film made over a century ago.
From a film historian point of view, it's really cool to own because of the fact that it's the first major motion picture with an all Native American cast. On the other hand, the film is in really terrible shape. While some of the footage looks pretty decent for 1914, other scenes are either missing entirely or terribly damaged beyond repair. One scene was so badly preserved, it looked so horrible I actually wished it was left out the cut entirely and replaced with a screenshot of the sequence or at least some text. Let this act as a reminder of film preservation.
As for what is there, it is rather fascinating to witness how Edward S. Curtis wanted to show how the Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest might have lived before European settlers ever set foot there.
I would only recommend this for major film fanatics like myself.",1434326400,,1025,4.545945945945946
8696266,5,B00RY0KEBE,"In The Land of the head hunters, by Edward S Curtis, is a nice addition to my Native American History Collection. The time and work the Edward Curtis put into this movie, was huge. His love, patience and journalism of American History is noted. Some of the movie is boring or silly, but what Edward Curtis was trying to convey in time-period clothing, transportation and Native beliefs, and Taboos, was quite an artful endevour. I am thankful that he spent his life preserving what otherwise would be lost forever.",1431043200,,514,4.786516853932584
8696267,5,B00RY0KEBE,"This video release by Milestone is a cultural treasure of the Kwakiutl First Nation.  The main feature is the restored 1914 film ""In The Land Of The Head Hunters.""  I have seen better restorations but the restorers can only do so much with what they have to work with!  If the reader does not already know, most films made before 1952 or so were made using  Nitrocellulose or celluloid.  Nitrocellulose is not an altogether stable substance.  So for any film made before 1952 it is a question of how much has the film detertiorated.  In fact there are special hazardous materials regulations to be observed when transporting films made with Nitrocellulose stock.  The film story is set in a time before European contact on the North American Pacific coast.  The story line itself is probably a fiction.  But the ceremonies, the masks, the costumes, and the people are authentic.  There is an edited 1973 version with a sound tract called ""In The Land Of The War Canoes.""  There was still another feature, a modern 21st century performance by Gwa wina dancers of their First Nation's ceremonial dances in traditional costumes.",1425686400,7,1125,4.863157894736842
8696268,5,B00RY0KEBE,"As a silent film enthusiast, I'm all for the restoration of old movies especially something as old and and as rare as this Edward S. Curtis film. The fact that it is 100 years old is astonishing. The fact that it it isn't in better condition is, alas, not astonishing at all as that is the fate of the majority of surviving silent films. The funds needed to do a proper restoration are astronomical by arts funding standards and then there's the issue of the material that the restorer has to work with.

IN THE LAND OF THE HEAD HUNTERS (the film's original title) was issued back in the 1970s as IN THE LAND OF THE WAR CANOES. The running time was roughly 45 minutes and this consisted of the best surviving footage from the original feature. It was marketed as a quasi-documentary made more authentic by the use of a Native American soundtrack consisting of authentic voices and instruments plus some water sounds. Milestone issued this DVD back in 1992 and it is included as a bonus with this set.

It turns out that Curtis never intended his movie to be a documentary but rather a traditional feature film just one set in the world of the Kwakiutl Indians of the Pacific Northwest, a world out of their distant past. He hired locals to portray his characters while they built the sets and made and provided the costumes. Curtis then hired composer John J. Braham to provide a complete classical music score with Native American overtones for the film. As this was 1914, it pre-dates BIRTH OF A NATION making it one of the oldest surviving film scores.

IN THE LAND OF THE HEAD HUNTERS (a surefire if somewhat lurid choice for a movie title back then) was to tell an epic story, be shot on location using local actors, and then given the full treatment from a fully composed score to specific color tints for several of the scenes. Not exactly what one would consider a box office winner but this was before Hollywood and the exotic locations plus Curtis' reputation as a still photographer did the trick and the film was a critical success at the time and then completely disappeared.

The recent discovery of the original orchestral score plus footage found in UCLA film archives helped to set this restoration in motion which brings up the following point. The footage of the restored version looks virtually the same as the 1972 version with title cards instead of subtitles which accounts for most of the extra length. The use of stills and the inclusion of badly decomposed footage adds little to the proceedings for me personally although the color tints are nice and it is great to hear the original score. As a silent film lover, I'm glad to have both versions but this time I found the older one more engaging than the newer one.",1425686400,11,2742,4.601226993865031
