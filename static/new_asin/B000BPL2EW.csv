2435732,5,B000BPL2EW,"I've always enjoyed Allo Allo.  From Day One, it's been the perfect blend of witty one-liners, slapstick, intrigue and bawdy humor.  However, I feel the series's momentum really picked up with this, the fourth season of the show.

I was sad to see the characters of Maria and Hans to leave the show, but their departure made room for two things that made the series so much funnier - the introduction of Mimi and more emphasis on Gruber.

From top to bottom, this season is hilarious.  The episode where Rene and Edith interview prospective replacements for Maria is a personal favorite of mine.  Highly recommended to fans of British comedy or any comedy for that matter.  Timelessly funny.",1130544000,31,691,4.805084745762712
2435733,5,B000BPL2EW,"The story begins where ended on last series. Rene continues risking his life to help the French Resistance and avoiding the Germans in the ocupied France of WWII in his small cafe.

The best British comedy series of the 80's with The Benny Hill Show. Hope BBC America releases the rest of the series.",1129248000,10,300,4.555555555555555

2435751,5,B000BPL2EW,"I have all nine disks of this series, and they all are very funny. This one is no exception. You need to watch them in order to follow the complete story.",1380931200,,154,4.0
2435752,5,B000BPL2EW,"fell in love with the series, watched it on PBS religiously. so glad it's available on dvd. makes me and my wife laugh every time we watch it and she's not even a history buff!",1366502400,,176,4.057142857142857
2435753,5,B000BPL2EW,"This program is funny in a cute, almost nostalgic way.  There are gags that are repeated throughout the nine seasons (they must have done something right!) that make you feel included in an inside joke.  Definitely overacted (intentionally and in a good way)  My husband and I enjoy the whole series.",1363996800,,300,4.8431372549019605
2435754,5,B000BPL2EW,Extremely Funny! Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed. Just what I needed.,1356480000,,256,4.14
2435755,5,B000BPL2EW,"This, like the other episodes of 'Allo, 'Allo, is excellent British comedy. Any fan of British comedy will love it.",1356307200,,115,4.8
2435756,5,B000BPL2EW,"I found this series quite by accident a few years ago when I was channel surfing.  I was very disappointed when LPB stopped airing the series, but I am very happy to find some of the episodes available on DVD.  ""Allo Allo"" ranks right up there with the best comedy series ever produced.  I find it absolutely amazing that they are able to work 16-18 regular characters into each episode, each with their own little quirks that you look for from episode to episode.  Unlike the ridiculous ""reality TV"" of today, this is TV at its finest.",1201564800,,536,4.494845360824742
2435757,5,B000BPL2EW,I seldom laugh aloud but this Brit Com has me bursting at the seams. I bought the whole series and the wife and I enjoy it as no other program either of us has ever watched.  Russ n' Annie,1197849600,,188,3.8205128205128207
2435758,5,B000BPL2EW,"I have really enjoyed all the series of ""Allo Allo!!!""... All the characters are beautifully dramatised and the dialogues and accent is just too Good!!! mind Blowing witty serial.. I have all the DVDs till series six..Im looking forward for the Series 7 to be released in Jan 2008..:-)

I highly recommend this for all those who just want to relax and laugh and enjoy ur evening after a tiring day at work..",1193184000,,407,4.575342465753424
2435779,5,B000BPL2EW,"'Allo! 'Allo! is a little bit Hogan's Heroes, a little bit Monty Python, and a great deal of politically incorrect fun!  'A'A sends up war movies through stereotypes -- no one is exempt, and yet 'A'A is never malicious.  In the end, like all good English comedy, its world view is genuinely benign.  Rene' joins Sergeant Schultz as a hero of humanity.",1181174400,,351,4.629032258064516
2435780,4,B000BPL2EW,"This season is great as well, only that they keep doing the same funny things, not much of a development. Yet - it's pure fun! :-)",1178928000,,130,4.038461538461538
2435781,1,B000BPL2EW,"Hard to rate this item. On the one hand I'm a Allo Allo afficionado and Series Four is just as funny as the other series. But on the other hand I have a hearing condition and was expecting this product to be closed captioned as mentioned on Amazon. Well, it is not!",1170720000,,265,4.115384615384615
2435782,5,B000BPL2EW,"I have purchased the first 4 seasons for various special occasions for my husband as gifts.  He used to watch the series when it aired on BBC years ago.  I was skeptical about watching them with him because I typically do not follow British humor.  But let me tell you, they are as much for me now as they are for him.  And Season 4 is just as funny as the first 3.  The only thing is, this season is only 1 disc, whereas the previous had 2 discs, so I felt we were short-changed a wee bit.  The addition of the Italian is SO funny.  We lose Maria in this season, but we gain the undercover Resistance member MiMi (I think that was her name) who also now has the hots for Rene.

We loved every episode of Season 4, and I will be ordering Season 5 for my husband (and myself) for Valentine's Day...I can't wait!!",1168473600,2,811,4.0886075949367084

2435784,5,B000BPL2EW,"Finally, the long-awaited comedy series is here... volume after volume. The series is a great pleasure to watch, with lots of laughter, ""kinky humor"", lots of slap-stick lines and physical comedy. Super quality television!!! a must-own DVD collection.",1144627200,5,251,5.631578947368421
2435785,5,B000BPL2EW,"the series 'allo 'allo is a very clever show.  the acting is great and it's easy to get sucked into this show!  If you start season 1 you won't quit until you've seen the entire series.

Amazon's price was lower than anywhere else and they mailed it out rapidly.  I wish that whoever puts this series out on disc would do it faster; it's hard to wait for the next sesason to be released and it's a long time between releases.  I've seen the entire series on PBS several times and it's really a fun show.",1142640000,3,503,4.197916666666667
2435786,5,B000BPL2EW,"This item is a gift that hasn't been given yet, so the only thing I can rate was the service which was great.  I appreciate getting advance notice of the release.",1141084800,,162,4.225806451612903
2435787,5,B000BPL2EW,"Series/Seasons 1-4 have been available on DVD [in PAL format] in the UK and Australia for some time. There is a great deal of hope among the growing numbers of fans that the remainder of the program [series/seasons 5-9] will also be made available. The availability of Series/Season Five DVD should tip us off if plans to release the remainder of Allo, Allo are in the works.

I would venture to guess, if you like Hogan's Heroes, you may take a liking to Allo, Allo as well. I did!

Give it a shot!",1140566400,6,499,4.354838709677419
2435788,5,B000BPL2EW,"Even when the Brits are doing the silliest stuff, they WORK at it.  The pure looniness of this series is enough to recommend it, but --

Every medal and line of the German uniforms is correct.  Who would care?  But if somebody's been on the Russian front, he's got the medals for it.

The cars are right, the clothes are right.  Even the farm machinery is right, and obviously borrowed from loving owners.  This gloriously goofball series is as exacting and accurate as a Masterpiece Theater presentation, at least in the prop department.

But wait -- is that the only work they've done?

The nutty handling of the accents is based on actual idiosyncracies of the various languages.

Even Leutnant Grueber, when trilling ""Attention!"" does it in the antique high-pitched tone of a Berlin sergeant.  How esoteric can you get?

The relationships of the characters -- from the desperate measures plain people have to go through to survive an occupation, to the sexual preferances in a murderous regime -- skate just this side of the horrific, and still manage to make us gasp with laughter, while accurately portraying the weirdness that was World War Two.  It's been said that the best comedy is based in suffering. If that's the case, this series is working the formula like a caisson horse.

The research on this series is just mind-boggling.  It makes it just that much more fun for a student of the period.

When the series needed to replace the actor who played Herr Flick, it didn't find someone who looked like him.  It found someone who acted and sounded like him, and then claimed he'd had plastic surgery.  Now that's chutzpah (pardon the reference).

It reminds us once again, as a character on The Jeffersons once said about a British neighbor:

""There's a whole ISLAND like him over there.""

'Allo, 'allo is another reason we should be glad.",1139529600,13,1851,4.7578616352201255
