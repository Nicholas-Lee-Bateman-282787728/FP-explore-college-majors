493850,2,6302622867,"The TV-movie version of Mildred Taylor's award-winning novel Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry can't help but be a major letdown, particularly to any English teachers who (like me) have used the movie as a classroom supplement to the magnificent, sprawling novel. Rarely have a great book's gifts been so squandered in an adaptation.
The story recounts the struggles of a poor black Mississippi family in the 1930's and their attempt to hold on to their family's piece of land despite the machinations of white bigots all around them. This is a story that should be sensitively and delicately adapted, which is the exact opposite of director Jack Smight's typically sledgehammer TV style.
For no good reason, the movie begins in the *middle* of the novel's story and then works its way backward and forward to encompass the novel's material. Thus, the novel's delicate character build-ups, which had rich payoffs in the novel's climax, are mostly laid waste here.
Many of the novel's subtlest yet most powerful images are destroyed here, simply by inadequate camera placement. One example is the incident where Mr. Morrison, the family's burly helper, moves a bigoted white man's car out of his path with his bare hands, while the white man looks on astonishment. The novel exquisitely describes the incident, culminating in  Mr. Morrison nonchalantly driving off while the cowardly bigot spews epithets at him. In the movie, the camera, which has been inexplicably swooping in and out of scene for most of the movie, sits in the same, dull stationary position throughout this scene. No close-ups of the bigot's or the children's surprised faces. And then the white man drives off on his own before Mr. Morrison does, neatly killing the entire point of the scene.
All that a viewer can really enjoy are the nice performances, particularly Morgan Freeman in an early-career role as the family's confrontational Uncle Hammer. Otherwise, the book's superb portrait of racism in the 1930's South is negated.",994464000,8,1998,5.072948328267477
493851,4,6302622867,"I loved the book and the movie.  It shows how a family w/ not alot of money can/could survive.  It also shows how young children have to listen to all the racism, and also be abused because of the wrong skin color.  It  shows to be strong and that no matter what someone thinks of you, does not  matter.  What matters is that you a proud of who you are.",952387200,10,353,3.9714285714285715
493852,2,6302622867,"I wish I could get ahold of the original uncut version of this.  In the editing process, events have been placed in the wrong order and much of the emotionalism we should feel has been eliminated. My students are very  disappointed in the film adaptation.  It does not do the book justice at  all.  Is there any way to find the original?",949622400,16,337,4.370967741935484
493853,1,6302622867,"I have just finished watching this book at school because we have been studying the book. The book is very good; it is gritty, down to earth and tells it like it is (in some parts it is quite violent). But the film is very disappointing. The acting is wooden, the children all look wrong (Cassie is supposed to be 9 but she looks 15) and constantly have cheesy grins on their faces. The film is too sentimental and cheesy. The film also cuts out a lot of the swearing and violence as well as other parts of the story. For example, John Henry Berry is badly burnt and in the book he is still alive and the children see him badly burnt but in the film he is buried under the rubble of his house and you do not see him.

This film not only badly acted, overly sentimental and inaccurate, it is also quite unfaithful to what is a quite short book. Do not watch this!!!",1131321600,10,864,4.142857142857143
493854,2,6302622867,"Most movies based on books do not deliver the power that the books do, but the film version of Roll of Thunder does an even worse job that usually is done.  It would be hard to replicate the experience of that wonderful story, but this movie does so little for the viewer that it is not worth the time to watch.  It is slow and drags on and on.",1114473600,4,344,3.971014492753623
493855,1,6302622867,"My Sallie Humble Elementary School 6th grade gifted class just viewed the video of ""Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"", after reading the novel by Mildred D. Taylor.  We think that the movie was jumbled and confusing.  There were scenes from the middle of the story in the beginning of the video and scenes from the middle of the story at the conclusion of the video.  One would not know what was happening in the movie unless he/she had read the novel.  We agree with another reviewer who said that they were eagerly awaiting Casey's retaliation towards Lillian Jean.  We were so disgruntled when this scene was not included in the movie.  The movie was a huge disappointment!  Our class enjoyed the book so much and anticipated that the movie would capture our interest, also.  It did not.  Don't bother watching this movie.",1112313600,4,821,4.685314685314685
493856,1,6302622867,"My fourth-grader and I read this wonderful book together and I hyped her on watching this movie, which came out when I was in the fourth grade in the seventies.  How disappointing!  What a rip-off!  This video takes edited scenes as a montage at the beginning and then starts in the middle of the story.  Entire scenes critical to character development and plot are lost--the beautiful relationship between the siblings, Stacie's relationship to TJ, how the Logans got their land and why they were so different than the other sharecropping families, the role of Mama and Big Ma in keeping the family together, etc.  You'd be lost watching this movie if you hadn't read the book.  My daughter and I were eagerly awaiting the scene when Cassie gets her revenge on Lillian Jean, which is shown only as a ending montage of scenes.  How unfortunate--with DVDs out now, there's no reason for this movie not to be available in its entirety.  I should have heeded the warnings of the other Amazon reviewers!",1069977600,30,999,4.767441860465116
493857,3,6302622867,"Ok, I agree that this movie was not one of the best movies, but the main reason most people hate it was because of it's strange order (different from the book)
Well......
When this movie first came out on TV, it had EVERYTHING! The whole book, I mean it was 4 hours long!  They cut it down and heavily edited it later, making it a far worse movie. Still, I think if people saw the unedited version, it might be better, it might not, but please stop bashing about how this movie is soooooo bad because of its order, when in real life, it had the WHOLE BOOK fit into it before the edits!",1050451200,2,585,4.131578947368421
493859,1,6302622867,"The movie was a HUGE disappointment from the book. It skipped around and started at the end; it was very hard to follow. If you hadn't read the book I don't think you would have understood the movie at all. It was a class project to read the book and we then watched the movie--it was a waste of time. I would never watch that movie again; they made Big Ma sound like she was dieing when she sang, it was terrible. My advice...don't watch the movie!!",1040169600,,450,4.183908045977011
493860,1,6302622867,"Beware!
The book by Mildred D. Taylor is powerful and riveting. I have used this book in my classroom and the children have loved it. The chance to use the video to enhance the book motivated me to buy it. Imagine my surprise when the video proved to be edited sloppily. The video jumps from one scene to another out of order. I believe the video, if in correct order, would be worthwhile. Morgan Freeman is always worth watching, and the rest of the cast is excellent also. This was a deep disappointment to me.
Since I was foolish enough to throw away the packaging, I cannot return it. If you purchase this video, save everything and check it out immediately. Now I will be forced to choose scenes to view in class, as watching the entire video would only be confusing to my class.",1018656000,2,784,4.413793103448276
7829136,3,6302622867,"""Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"", is about the Logan family who are black landowners in Mississippi in the 1930's.  They face inequality and racism.  Their love for each other, family loyalty and pride help them face many problems and difficulties.  I liked the movie because it did a good job of showing how hard life for a black family during that time.  I thought the actors did a good job of bringing the characters to life.  I did not like how the movie was out of sequence from the book.  Also, there were many changes from the book.  For example the Simms's ' children were Wallace children in the movie.  Mr. Wallace pushed Cassie into the street and made her apologize to Lillian-Jean in the movie, but it was Mr. Simms in the book.  Also, Uncle Hammer scolded Stacey for giving his coat to T.J. in the book, and in the movie, it was Papa who scolded Stacey.  In the movie Mr. Berry died in the fire and in the book he was severely burned but lived.  I did not like how the movie left out parts of the book.  I liked the book better than the movie",1426032000,,1054,4.241206030150754
7829137,2,6302622867,This is an amazing book. While the acting in the TV series was wonderful the editing was awful with sequences of the story in the wrong order. The review of the sequences of the story were all strung together before the actual story at the front of the actual tv broadcasts of the story and was confusing and a spoiler. No music except some gospel songs in the background. I could not help but think it is racism that allowed such a talented cast of actors and such a fine story to be so badly edited and produced. I wish someone would reedit and put the proper care to background music because it is a fine performance and a classic American story.,1421107200,2,649,4.327868852459017
7829138,4,6302622867,"For anyone who remembers the three part mini series the editors really cut out a majority of the film. There are things that are out of sequence, so we are left with a little bit of a mess. However, I feel that when they put this one up on the chopping block, they did a decent job of focusing on the important things that were central to the movie. The acting was superb on everyone's account and I thought the tape wasn't all that bad as some reviewers are blasting it. Maybe someday some studio will pick this up and release the whole 3 part series. Til then, i'll just do my best to enjoy what has been given to us.",1386201600,,619,4.12396694214876

7829143,1,6302622867,The Movie is totally confusing.  It leaves out important scenes that are relevant to movie.  I jumps around.  The casting is all wrong.  Cassie looks 15 instead of 9.  She's much bigger than Stacey who is 12-13!  I've shown this movie to my students over 10 years and none of them like it at all.  They actually get angry while watching because they know scenes are not correct.  It is a good lesson in compare/contrast and how a book can be so much better than the movie.,1274400000,2,472,4.344827586206897
7829144,3,6302622867,"The video story had a good concept, a good plot showing events that were very realistic, but it left out key events such as the revenge of Cassie against Lilian Jean, how the blacks were treated in school, and the revenge of the Logan children getting back at the white bus driver.

7829145,1,6302622867,"This movie was made by someone on a diet of white bread and packaged vegetables - bland, blander, blandest.  Whereas the book is moving, if a bit over-reliant upon the narrator Cassie overhearing everything and all the children getting into the action, yet again, the movie makes you want to yell obscenities.  One example will do.  The book is set in the Depression-era Deep South, rural Mississippi - it didn't get any worse for blacks - and the sharecroppers are desperately poor.  Yet the characters all look as though they're just shopped off the rack at the country store.  There's no fire, no emotion, no tension.

I urge another attempt at a movie of this book because it could be outstanding - the plot is there for people to do something wonderful.",1137801600,22,758,4.704545454545454
