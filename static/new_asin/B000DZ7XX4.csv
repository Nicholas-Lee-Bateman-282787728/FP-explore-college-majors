8102763,5,B000DZ7XX4,It was everything I expected it to be! Love Enjouji's english voice! Ranmaru's could have been better but he made me laugh.,1374451200,,123,4.636363636363637
8102764,3,B000DZ7XX4,"My friend (who gave this to me for my birthday) and I went into this anime after reading the first couple deluxe editions of the Kizuna manga. I would imagine that if you haven't read the series, it would be hard to follow the storyline without thinking that it is completely stupid. It is no easy task to stuff a story involving a shattered Kendo career, the complicated relationship that a bastard son of a Yakuza boss shares with the younger legitimate child, the desire said younger legitimate child has for the bastard's boyfriend, a gross professor who apparently has access to large gangs of men that beat up random guys for him (?), and the obligatory and never-consensual sexy-time that accompanies most yaois... all within the span of 30 minutes.

The product of this impossible endeavor is a cheesy, complicated, fluffy and confusing anime that we,personally, managed to salvage by poking fun at the entire time.

The original Japanese version of Kizuna was easier to take serious, probably because stupid stuff sounds less stupid when you read it in subtitles. The heightened emotions and reactions are easier to swallow as well when it's delivered in Japanese. However, Enjoji's voice is quite annoying and whiny and made me hate the character.

In the English dub, that voice is significantly improved (and I plan on getting Dan Green to sign my copy of the DVD if I ever see him at a con). However, the actor voicing Ranmaru sounds like he's bored and whiny throughout the entire episode. This is harder to ignore when you actually speak the language. And the voices of the hosts at the gay (ahem, I mean hustler) bar are really, REALLY funny.

The horrible dialogue is also impossible to ignore when put into English. Everything seems forced or grossly cheesy, which I suppose is typical for Yaoi. For example, there is a part where Enjoji gets cut with a sword (Wondering how this happens in a fluffy story about host clubs and perverted professors? Get used to it.). He then licks the blood off of his face while making a noise most akin to a snake rasping its tongue. Also, when characters get mad their eyes turn scarlet red or their entire body is surrounded by a blue glow. I guess that's just what happens to red-headed Japanese boys when they get, like, really, really mad.

I just wish that they had done a better job. Kizuna legitimately had potential to be just a tiny bit better than the average Yaoi, and they totally dropped the ball. Why they chose to put the parts of the story they did into the anime is beyond me but hey: if you've read the manga this will at least be interesting. And if you're willing to go into it with a sense of humor, you might even get a few laughs out of it.",1373673600,,2717,4.59381443298969
8102765,3,B000DZ7XX4,"I bought this because I'm an avid yaoi and Dan Green fan, so the combination of the two seemed like an obvious purchase to make.  But of course, as too common with yaoi OVAs, there is a serious lack in story.  Overall, I don't regret making the purchase, I just have to ask ""Dan Green Y U voice bad yaoi??""",1307923200,,306,4.083333333333333
8102766,5,B000DZ7XX4,"I consider myself a straight man but I am proud to say I am a Yaoi fan. I feel that Homosexual relationships be it male or female(I prefer male) are the last forbidden love frontier since movies and books like Twilight and Moulin Rouge have already exhausted the Romeo and Juliet style of forbidden love. In this era of a conservative supreme court and eight years of a religous conservative president homosexual relationships are becoming taboo in some societies who hold family values dear. But what is a family but a unit of people that love each other. Enough editorializing lets talk about this fabulous OVA. This dvd contains the first two OVA's of Kizuna which from it's beginning moments leaves you feeling breathless and fluttery. The story of Kei and Ranmaru is one frought with drama and segments where you worry if the couple will stay together(I haven't watched the second one but my momma always says everything will turn out in the end). There is enough drama and emotional moments to please those who like a little drama with their romance and yes there is some sex. However the sex in it is suggested and not really hardcore. In yaoi the sex is softcore and not shown in graphic detail. But if you just think of it as like an HBO show then you can get past it, I already have.  I would recomend this to anyone who loves their anime with emotion and maturity or just a romantic like me.

Also to answer a previous reviewer's question. Yes this is the only two out there, this edition has both episodes one and two. The third one, is on a dvd called Much Ado About Nothing which like this dvd is out of print. There is no plans to release a box set since according to wikipedia(which is not always reliable) the company that released this BeBeautiful has since gone out of business and media blasters adult anime imprint Kitty owns Much ado.

So what are you waiting for straight yaoi loving otaku out there. Buy it already.",1255564800,10,1939,4.534285714285715
8102767,1,B000DZ7XX4,"If I had read the manga, I'm sure I would enjoy seeing it brought to life, but as a stand-alone it's not worth it. The characters aren't very developed and the story line is definitely lacking. It's short. The extras are nothing fun. The artwork is passable; I've seen worse but it's nothing exceptional. The voices aren't that appealing (a big selling point for me when it comes to anime). It was a waste of money, honestly.",1208131200,,425,4.532467532467533
8102768,4,B000DZ7XX4,"I bought the Kizuna Kodaka Signature Edition under the impression that it was the entire series but there are only two episodes on it. Was that the entire series or is there more with the ""volume 2"" that is out there?  Seems odd that a series should only have two episodes.  Otherwise, it was pretty good. It left a lot of threads hanging and I struggled to keep straight who was related to whom but that seems to be standard for anime.",1160956800,3,436,4.304878048780488
8102769,5,B000DZ7XX4,"I personally prefer the Manga over the Anime but this is a great edition to any Yaoi Fans collection ~ not to mention the fact it's the first Yaoi Anime to have an English Dub!

The only problem with the Dub is that it features Dan Green as Enjouji, and if you don't know who Dan Green is - he's the voice of Yugi from Yugi Oh! And hearing Yugi during the `rompy' scenes is...odd...lmao. Dan Green also did the voice of Tsuzuki from Descendants of Darkness so it's all good.

There are quiet a number of extras which is a nice change. And just a note, the animation is older compared to titles like Gravitation (which is out now) so if you're not a fan of older Anime art forms, this probably won't be the best for you.",1147564800,9,719,4.16546762589928
