1633856,4,B00005NGA9,"This 1963 movie features Fonteyn and Nureyev in excerpts from LE CORSAIRE, LA VALSE, SLEEPING BEAUTY (ACT III AURORA'S WEDDING), & LES SYLPHIDES. This can be enjoyed for the music, the dancing and as a piece of wondurful  ballet history with two of ballet's greatest stars.",946166400,10,273,4.934782608695652
1633858,4,B00005NGA9,"For anyone who loves ballet, this is for you. Superb dancing, well scripted and acted. For some, the dancing might be a little repetitious.",1356048000,2,139,4.833333333333333
1633859,5,B00005NGA9,"I bought this DVD to get a permanent record of Fonteyn and Nureyev dancing in Les Sylphides. I wasn't disappointed! It is a perfect record of a perfect ""white"" ballet.",1353801600,3,167,4.6
1633860,5,B00005NGA9,"I was a ballet student and huge ballet fan growing up in the 60s-70s, and had indulgent parents who would stretch their budget to allow me the occasional journey from Long Island to Manhattan to see visiting and NY ballet companies.  I was privileged to personally see a Fonteyn & Nureyev performance with the Royal Ballet, one of their last, of ""Marguerite & Armand"" at the Met in NY, and she was an aspiring young dancer's dream - beautiful, graceful, classic with perfect form, and what EMOTION; she was the only ballerina I ever saw who put her whole heart and soul into the character, and owned it.  It is wonderful that some of this talent is preserved in films like ""Evening with the Royal Ballet"" and also Czinner's ""Royal Ballet,"" both of which feature Fonteyn in select acts of famous ballets.  I have also recently purchased the Fonteyn biography by Meredith Daneman which was interesting but mostly speculation; if you really want to learn about Fonteyn, her art always came first, and it is much better to snap up as many performance DVDs or tapes as you can find like this one, to have a true understanding of this amazing prima ballerina assoluta and why she was so beloved.",1331856000,10,1189,4.652380952380953
1633861,1,B00005NGA9,"The creator of this dvd should improve the quality of the video before it is offered for sale.  This is a definite rip off.  No matter how good the dancers, if the quality of the video is this bad, then too the dancers look so bad.  It is a waste of our hard earned money.",1266451200,4,272,3.909090909090909
1633862,5,B00005NGA9,A must have for the ballet purist!  Especially for those who remember Nureyev and Fonteyn's reign supreme!!,1234224000,4,107,5.294117647058823

1633864,4,B00005NGA9,"Margot is certainly a wonderful dancer and so is Nureyev. Les Sylphides is beautiful with the tutu's and choreography. I did not like La Valse really though. The Sleeping Beauty was lovely. Margot and David Blaire were excellent and I loved the Bluebird pas de deux. On the whole I really enjoyed it but I also recommend Essential Ballet for people wanting a beautiful dvd of excerpts. It is with the Kirov Ballet and has bits from The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, The Firebird, Giselle, Don Quixote, Paquita, and quite a few more.",1121299200,14,546,4.757894736842105

1633866,1,B00005NGA9,"the video quality of this dvd is bad, terriable and completely

1633867,5,B00005NGA9,"Les Sylphides, Le Corsaire, La Valse, and Sleeping Beauty (Act III)....
Les Sylphides is absolutely magical, the best performance of this ballet I've ever seen.  Nureyev gives his usual intense, wonderful  performance, and Fonteyn -- words cannot describe the beauty of her every  exquisite movement.  This ballet is, perfectly suited to her lyrical style.  IMO, Fonteyn had the most incredibly expressive arms....  But before I  start rambling (or have I already?)....
Le Corsaire is an absolutely  brilliant performance from Nureyev, and Fonteyn dances beautifully as well  (although her performance is perhaps a bit too subdued in comparison to  Nureyev's mindblowing one).
La Valse was probably wonderful to see live,  but the magic is kind of lost on film.  I think it's one of those ballets  you had to see in person.
Sleeping Beauty is a joy to see.  Fonteyn is  wonderful as usual, and David Blair makes a superb prince, very noble and  suave.  A young Antoinette Sibley gives an exquisite peerformance in the  Blue Bird pas de deux.
A great buy!",950313600,55,1054,5.02906976744186
7947079,5,B00005NGA9,"This is a thoroughly satisfying program of dance from the Royal Ballet.  Nureyev and Fonteyn are legendary dancers and this sampling shows why.  I remember seeing this film long ago and am very happy to be able to add it to my video collection at last.  Nureyev's solos in ""Le Corsaire"" are utterly dazzling.",1490140800,2,308,4.666666666666667

This disc gives the viewer the best seat in the house to enjoy flawless performances by Nureyev and Fonteyn, probably the world's talented ballet duo.  Lucky us!!!",1415318400,2,315,4.607142857142857
