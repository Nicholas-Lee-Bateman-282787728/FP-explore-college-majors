.
The illustration drawn by computer graphic effects helps make the explanation lively and easier to understand. For example, it plays a key role in explaining the pump that helps with erectile function. I have heard of it before but I have never seen it in action until now.

The tone is funny. It is not dry as a textbook.

It covers a lot subject likes: What makes a woman like a man at first sight and vice versa, approach anxiety, gay and bisexual sexuality, erectile dysfunction, asexual, sexual transmitted disease, etc.

The only problem is it covers most of them in a very short time because the whole DVD lasts only 90 minutes. Only the part about ""What makes a woman like a man and vice versa"" is given enough time to make me feel somewhat satisfactory.

In short, it deserves 5 stars.",1393372800,3,881,4.4875
