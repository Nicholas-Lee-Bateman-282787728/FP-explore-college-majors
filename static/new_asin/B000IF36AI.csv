8145271,5,B000IF36AI,"Even if not so magnificent a film as the also gay-themed ""C.R.A.Z.Y."", this film, ""La Rage de l'Ange"" (""Angel's Rage"" being the English title), which appeared so shortly afterwards, is an expression of the socio-sexual culture of some youthful Quebeckers of recent times. Francis is a ""tender-tough"" lad. He, Luce, and ric are, to varying degrees, bisexual, all physically quite attractive and with unmistakably and almost painfully self-destructively difficult, non-conventional
values and way of life. There are some aspects of the film that may strike certain viewers as too sentimentalised; they do not ruin the film, except for those who have zero tolerance for the saccharine elements, but the milieu in which these kids live is portrayed with an almost unrelenting sordidness, which compensates considerably. It saddens one that the film ends so tragically, but in the neo-liberal (""neo-con"") era of Paul Martin, Stephen Harper, George W. Bush, Jean Charest, et alia, there really is little to stir up hope in the hearts and minds of many marginalised young people such as the film's protagonists, unless they lash out in revolt, as in the work's action.

Here there will be a a concentration on some comments specifically about sexuality and the arts, important aspects of the film, even if the resulting description is therefore partial and one-sided.

There is a fair bit of gay content in ""Rage de l'Ange"", lesbian as well as male-gay, the main characters being, to one degree or another gay (ric) or bisexual (Francis, Luce, and Sandra, Luce's fellow prostitute and lesbian protectress), so here the comments will concentrate on the gay sexual and artistic aspects of the film's music, visual, and poetical arts more than on plot, setting, and characterisation.

Francis, ric, and Luce are all young Qubcois who have been abused, sexually and by other excessive physical violence, when they were children (as the early part of the film, set in their difficult childhood years, confirms), so each, on his or her own life's path, ends up in the punkish underworld of crime (prostitution, especially female, but male ""hustling"", too) and, to some extent, drugs. Francis (the ""tender-tough"" character, who is very ""cute""-looking, in the achingly beautiful person of Alexandre Castonguay, an actor from the Abitibi region) beats up his dad (played by Dan Bigras, the pan-Qubec famous rocker, who also is the film's director) when that older man punishes him brutally one time too many. Francis runs away from home, ending up reunited in a gang with his pal of childhood and adolescence, i.e. with ric, a willowy, very pretty young man (as acted by Patrick Martin) from a broken family, whose mother had become a ""bag lady"" when ric's parents' marriage broke up. Francis had defended ric from bullies when they were children. Their affection for each other sometimes would lead Francis to have sex with ric, but not to the exclusion of girls. Shortly after this flight to Montral's slums, Francis meets up again, also, with his childhood sweetheart, Luce, now a youthful prostitute (played by Isabelle Gurard), whom her odious father had abused as a girl. Luce becomes Francis' female lover, but she also is involved in a lesbian relationship with the tough (but, in the final count, kind-hearted) whore, Sandra (played by Lulu Hughes).

As for the film's story line, it is good, and those dangers of sentimentality that lurk are offset by the unremittingly sordid, graffitti-laden atmosphere of most of the settings, reminding one of the worst and ugliest aspects of gritty and run-down sections of Greater Montral, such as Hochelaga, certain stretches of ""The Main"" (boul. St-Laurent), or the worst parts of the N.D.G. quarter.

An interesting detail about ""Rage de l'Ange"" is that when Francis does join the gang and is told to choose one of its members as his sort of personal ""gang brother"", Francis opts for one from his boyhood years, and it is this very ric whom Francis chooses to be his gang partner. Such a choice astonishes the other gang members, but since pretty and rather passive and unviolent ric is the one whom they consider condescendingly as their ""mascot"", they call ric a faggot but tolerate him to be with them in the gang anyway, even if ric does not participate with the others in their thuggish acts. The gang accept him begrudgingly presumably because ric's artistic talents serve well in supplying the gang's superb territorial graffitti and other gang art, and also, one assumes, because ric provides a willing outlet to the gang members' pent-up sexual tensions, when females are not available sexually in a timely way. One wonders if the vicious Latino runt who controls the gang, due more to his cunning and psychopathic cruelty than from any brawny physical prowess (in which, like ric, he is utterly lacking) might have ric as his steady boyfriend; if so, ric would have the Chicano runt as well as Francis as habitual sex partners, perhaps creating some plausible gang tension, but the film is not explicit about this possibility. ric, interestingly, paints a rather sexily nude portrait of Francis, his still protective friend from boyhood days, which Luce, a bit upsets, points out to Francis subsequent to ric's hospitalisation after a former ""john"" (or those whom such an homosexual client of ric had set to the act) attacked ric, to almost fatal results.

For his part, Francis, the ""Angel"", gets to take off some clothes, for that matter, when he receives oral sex from his girlfriend, Luce, and when he makes attempts (at last successfully) to penetrate her sexually (something to which her father's abuse had made her adverse as any genuine expression of love). Even if Alexandre Castonguay's body is not particularly athletically well-developped, his boyish charms (as Francis) include, among others, a chest that bears two lusciously gorgeous nipples, set in his pellucidly beautiful conplexion, traits wbich many gay male viewers will appreciate.

There is one hauntingly lovely scene, despite the as ever sordidly ugly setting in which it occurs, where a dissolute character who dresses up in a bishop's worn-out accoutrement, and who is called ""notre pape"" (""our Pope"", played by Pierre Lebeau), declaims a beautiful poem while the bar band plays (in the really seedy punk, female nude strip-dancing club doubling as gang bar), in a sort of up-dated ""beat"" fashion, a minimaistic and quite evocative musical background to his long poem. (The use of the tubular bells-like instrument seems odd in such a punk or ""alternative music"" band, but it helps to give the extraordinary poem that much more mesmerising a musical underpinning that is quite quite memorable.) In fact, the music in the film, a lot of it aptly chosen from opera and classical choral music, is of great beauty; I would not have anticipted this from a ""rocker"" director such as Dan Bigras very famously is!

However, few surely would have expected a musical pop star like Dan Bigras to have produced such a consummately fine moving picture at all! Buy the DVD (Alliance-Atlantis 22314), which only intermittently has appeared on Amazon's WWW sites, and enjoy it, whether for the first time or as a way to relive the pleasures of this extraordinary film!",1195084800,,7275,5.056666666666667
