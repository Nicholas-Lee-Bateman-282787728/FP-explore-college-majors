8100669,5,B000CQQISK,"The documentary features the very best of both worlds as a telegenic President visits the cradle of his ancestors and the country that was as close to his heart and  affection as was his beloved USA. This is a nostalgic and sentimental journey to his beloved Ireland. There is alot of footage to witness how much JFK was beloved in this beautiful country.

The haunting sound of a tenor voice that sings at the end is awsome. He sings"" ""Ill be on my way to a far away land, on the shores of America"" as a child , I watched this  with my Mother and we were trully inspired at the pathos and the serenity of this momentous documentary.
