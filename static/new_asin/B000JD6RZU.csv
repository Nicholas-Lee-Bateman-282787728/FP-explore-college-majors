From the get go, this is a tale about just how bad a Christmas really can get, with murder and mayhem following Mia Farrow's character every year.  Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker play amazing roles, with very haunting moments.  Mia Farrow was perfectly cast for this role.",1326672000,,396,4.628571428571429
8150013,5,B000JD6RZU,"Apparently this movie is sadly under-rated... I've been playing this on VHS for years, would be GREAT to get it on DVD.  Everyone I've shown it to loves it... Several friends and I consider it a Xmas classic... in that fun sorta demented way... I can't believe it hasn't been released in US format, I know at least 5 folks that would buy it within a mile radius... DVD POWERS THAT BE... PLEASE RELEASE IN US!",1322006400,2,408,4.368421052631579

 of it - It is a Christmas classic for my family - great story and acting.",1276300800,,140,3.6666666666666665
8150015,4,B000JD6RZU,"This is an outstanding adaptation of an outstanding play by Craig Lucas, following the surreal adventures of an optimistic housewife once she narrowly escapes death by a hitman hired by her own husband.  I can't seem to find a copy of this film in a USA-friendly format, and I'm desperate to do so, because it's really one of my favorites.  Highly recommended--- very funny, touching, and completely original.  PLEASE, whoever controls the rights to this film--- make it available on DVD for American audiences!  In the meanwhile, for those who can view the available format, I strongly recommend it!",1234051200,,600,5.03030303030303
