7887770,1,6305279187,"I strongly recommend renting this video before purchasing. Mostly, because it is quite simply, awful. I've always been a big fan of Animation, but this video was sub direct-to-video quality. In this film the plot is butchered to include, (amongst other things), a talking panda, a dragon and an evil skull-uniform-wearing general complete with underground fort, a legion of badies in skull ying/yang armor, and an American bald eagle (!)
The good:  The only (somewhat) well-designed character was Mulan and her Grandfather. There is a somewhat decent message at the beginning about not judging people by their appearance/color of skin, which I felt was appropriate.
The bad: It's too bad the animators didn't take the movie's message to heart when they chose to draw most of the Chinese in an ugly, stereotyped and exaggerated way. The art had me cringing! And if the good guys were ugly, the `evil' villains, looking more like trolls than people. Also, the voice acting was terrible. Mulan sounded like a cranky teenager reading her lines completely deadpan. The rest of the Chinese sounded like they were voiced by one guy, with a Brittish accent!
Overall, while I expected to find this movie MILDLY entertaining, instead it was dime-store anime at its worst. Watch at your own risk.",1051747200,2,1285,5.032863849765258
7887771,1,6305279187,"First of all-be warned, NOT the Disney version for kids.  Dark, violent, typical Japanese amination, and a wandering storyline that ultimately had me up and--of all things--vacuuming halfway through it.  I kept trying to  return, but each time I reached the same conclusion--BAD.  Bad, bad, bad.",940464000,,295,5.3478260869565215
