8482810,3,B005Q130FK,"Very helpful on some features, and as an overview.  It glosses over others and refers to an additional DVD package.  It's understandable that one lesson can't cover everything.  I wish the Zoom manual and this DVD would explain send-return at a beginner level, for example.",1454112000,,273,5.022222222222222

8482812,5,B005Q130FK,Good clear instruction by a guy who def knows his stuff.,1450224000,,56,4.181818181818182
8482813,5,B005Q130FK,"This is a very well done video.  I spent way too much time trying to read through the manual and figure things out before I threw in the towel and bought this.  This was a great investment.  Everything is well structured and well presented.  Someone mentioned poor video quality - not true.  I watched it on a large 42"" screen and it was very clear.  Not HD, but perfectly clear.  If you watch it on a PC you might get poor results due to restrictions that your PC is imposing which is probably what happened to one reviewer.

There are a few sections in the DVD where he starts going faster then you can follow. So I wind up backing up and replaying it. But that's about the only negative aspect.

I had been using the R16 recorder for about 6 months prior to getting this DVD.  I wish I bought it earlier.  My recordings would have sounded better and I would have been more confident in playing with the features.",1438214400,,915,4.292397660818714
8482814,4,B005Q130FK,"It's very well made, and easy to understand. It definitely took me from zero knowledge to recording in a couple of days. The only complaint I have is that most, if not all, of the videos on the disk are on YouTube for free.",1437091200,,223,4.090909090909091
8482815,3,B005Q130FK,"Beware if you live in the UK, be sure to check that your DVD player can show American DVDs as I didn't and it won't play on my system. In fairness it is my fault as I should have read further into the product details before buying where it clearly states the operating  system, hence my 3 stars. I hope to be able to get it transfered to UK compatable systems but am not holding my breath.",1429833600,,389,4.0519480519480515
8482816,4,B005Q130FK,"This was well produced but targeted towards the musician.
If you are doing other live recording you will pick up
some tips but again geared to musicians",1397779200,,152,4.666666666666667
8482817,5,B005Q130FK,"The Zoom R16 is just what I was looking for to do on-site live recording of small music group.  However, I found that the User's Manual that came with the R16 left something to be desired.  The video tutorial was extremely helpful.  I learned more about the R16 by viewing this video tutorial - it;s about 2 hours - than hours and hours of study of the User's Manual.  I highly recommend the Zoom R16 DVD Video Tutorial as a companion to the User's Manual.",1377302400,,456,4.329411764705882
8482818,2,B005Q130FK,"THE DVD PUBLISHER HAS NOT MADE A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE OPERATION AND SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE UNIT.

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL FOR USER OF R16 IF PUBLISHER COULD HAVE TAKEN THE TOPIC SERIOUSLY. THERE IS NO MENU, NO INDEXING,
SOUND QUALITY OF RECORDING IS POOR AND IN STEREO LOW QUALITY.

BUT SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING",1355184000,,333,4.533333333333333
