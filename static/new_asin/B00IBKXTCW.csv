Amateurish scripting. I lasted twenty minutes into the first show and then quit.

6256495,5,B00IBKXTCW,Republic of Doyle is a comedy-drama set in St John's Newfoundland.  It's a great advertisement for St John's and its inhabitants.  The balance between comedy and drama is generally quite good and the show reminds me of the old American Rockford series in more ways than one - a son-father team of detectives and a great car with loads of car chases around the town.  There's lots of romance for the ladies and the recurring villains are many of Canada's best actors.,1367625600,2,466,4.658536585365853
6256496,1,B00IBKXTCW,"Predictable formula series with horrible acting.  Not even the scenes from St. John's

6256497,5,B00IBKXTCW,"I bought this season of the Republic of Doyle, hoping that I would like it as it is one of the top shows on CBC. Well, I l didn't like it, I loved it. Republic of Doyle is not your normal cop or crime show. I found the characters very entertaining and have to suppress the urge to jump in my car and explore the Atlantic coast of Canada. Season one is reasonably priced (as was the shipping). It arrived very quickly (a lot faster than I thought). I can't wait to see season two.",1339545600,,479,4.052631578947368
6256498,5,B00IBKXTCW,"Republic of Doyle is fun. Visually and verbally a delight to watch. The pacing is quick and the characters are charming. The extras, an insight into the lifes of Canadian actors and writers. I highly recommend this series.",1333324800,6,222,4.868421052631579
6256499,5,B00IBKXTCW,"Very different from the typical US crime/detective series, this is an incredible slice of life in newfoundland.  Witty, humorous, action-packed, personal, and everyday, all at the same time.  Perfect.",1330560000,6,200,5.862068965517241
6256500,5,B00IBKXTCW,"This is a great show, with excellent character portrayal by some great actors.  However, the location--St. John's, Newfoundland--and the absolutely amazing cinematography, steals the show.",1311724800,11,188,6.52
6256501,4,B00IBKXTCW,"One of the reasons that I purchased REPUBLIC OF DOYLE is not only for the story, but for the scenes of St. Johns.  Such a beautiful city.",1304208000,9,137,4.074074074074074
6256502,5,B00IBKXTCW,"I am not sure if it is the location that makes it quirky or different.  I knew very little of St. John's Bay prior to watching this series and was thrown by the Irish accents until I confronted ""the oracle"" (AKA Google).  I watched season 1 with a friend over the course of 2-days.  What makes this different from other shows centered around a PI, is that Doyle (an ex-cop that works with his father - a retired cop) seems to get is ""A"" kicked on a semi-regular basis!  It is almost a running gag how often he gets hit in the nose.  Doyle doesn't carry a gun and niether do most of the bad guys.  Frankly, I don't miss the lack of gun play.  Witty dialog, family situations and interesting (AKA different) cases make this show work.  If you follow Canadian TV there are cameos by a who's-who in Canadian TV.

I can't wait for season 2 to wrap up and hope that this show doesn't fall into the CBC ""trap"" that had befallen The Border and Intelligence.",1299974400,21,949,4.256983240223463
6256503,5,B00IBKXTCW,"Not since the days of Twitch City, Corner Gas, and This is Wonderland has CBC created such a thoroughly quirky, enjoyable, and escapist program. Republic Of Doyle centers on a wryly funny and sometimes lovably rogue father/son detective team working the not so mean streets in what is one of North America's most entrancingly beautiful cities, St John's, Newfoundland. While solving cases, the son, played deftly with his native Newfie accent by Allan Hawco, must also deal with a stone cold crazy ex, played by Rachel Wilson, that he just can't seem to shake, and a palpably intense Moonlighting-esque sexual tension with his local constable, the breathtaking and ravishingly beautiful Krystin Pellerin. This well written Gemini award nominated detective series is a jewel in an otherwise gastly and ratchet collection of current network primetime series. I look forward to watching a long run with season 2 set to premiere on CBC Television Wednesday January 5 in the plum 9pm timeslot following Dragon's Den (9:30 in Newfoundland).",1290211200,42,1034,5.234939759036145

6256508,5,B00IBKXTCW,"Combines sleuthing, comedy and family dynamics in an interesting mix and gives outsiders a glimpse into the little known country of Newfoundland. Good tv series.",1482624000,,161,5.48
6256509,1,B00IBKXTCW,"Very disappointing! Most of the people are of very similar ages and from low class backgrounds. They mostly seem to lack any morals and the main character is shown in most episodes having explicit sex. There is a plot in each story, but it seems to come second to the love action as well as to violence of one kind or another. Many of the female characters seem to always be dressing and projecting their sexuality in such a way which seems way overdone. The acting is poor, over dramatized and somewhat hyper. The dialog isn't always easy to understand either. We ordered 2 more series, but if they don't improve we'll be returning all of them. We thought St. Johns, Newfoundland and the surrounding area would make a nice backdrop to this Private Investigator story but so far it would never give us the desire to visit the place. Are there any normal people with half a brain living there? The character of Malachy is the best of all the characters while his son who appears to be the star needs to clean up his life and quieten down as he appears to be very hyper. Frankly, if he was my son I'd throw him out, as he often embarrasses his father (Malachy) who is often chastening him. In the final analysis, the scriptwriters could have written so much of a better script and at least made the plots somewhat clearer! There have been many Private Eye series through years and most have been so much better than Republic of Doyle!",1481328000,,1432,4.469465648854962

6256514,5,B00IBKXTCW,"I watched the whole series as the shows came out on CBC . . . and what a ride! It is fast-paced and never predictable, except that you can always count on someone making a choice that leads to all sorts of mayhem. Strictly speaking, however, I think I would classify it as a ""dramedy."" There are indeed lots of funny scenes and a good deal of physical comedy (by the third season, after all of the knocks on his head, we should expect Jake Doyle to be suffering brain damage). Despite all the comic situations, there are several serious subplots winding their way through the series that keep us hooked, along with some serious cliffhangers at the end of a few seasons (for which I had to wait until the next season to see resolved). Allan Hawco (the executive producer, writer, and star) is from Newfoundland, where the series is set, as are most of the cast, as well as Great Big Sea, the band responsible for the great series theme song.

By the way, there were a couple of interesting crossovers, with Jake Doyle's ancestor of the same name appearing in an episode of Murdoch Mysteries (""Republic of Murdoch,"" season 7, episode 8), and a descendent of Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) featured in a Republic of Doyle episode, ""If the Shoe Fits"" (season 5, episode 14).

This series will hook anyone who likes fast-moving dramedy with a mix of cops, family, relatable bad guys, great acting, and a sympathetic view of Newfie life.",1470787200,,1443,4.6328125

6256516,5,B00IBKXTCW,"I need to have subtitles to watch a show as I am deaf. I always check to make sure a DVD has CC or a reference to subtitles on the case before buying it. The case for this DVD says ""CC"" AND ""English Closed Captioning"" on it. But it doesn't actually have it. In fact, there is no mention of it on the disc menu. I have my TV CC on and the CC on the DVD player is on too but neither are working BECAUSE the DVD is not really closed captioned! Not cool! I wasted my money because I can't use it. Why did I give it a 5 star review? Because the show itself which I saw on Netflix already, is amazing! And it's not the fault of the show that the manufacturer misled people by putting CC on the box without actually having it on the DVD.",1470268800,,730,3.8410596026490067

6256535,5,B00IBKXTCW,"This was great. Sorry to see it ended after season 6. Before getting some of the reviews said the dialect was hard to understand, assumed I misremembered  Geography and they spoke French. Got a giggle right away, I had no idea Canadian English was a dialect. There are a couple of Irish, English visitors that pop up but this Californian had no problems understanding them.
Reminds me of Psych, the silliness with an underlying serious issue. The only thing totally not right is that anyone hit in the head and punched in the face as much as the main character would be brain damaged and have so many scars you could play tic tac toe on his face.
I don't know if Canadian TV does feature films but I'd love to see the Doyles' and extended family in some further adventures.",1441411200,,773,4.4822695035460995

6256553,5,B00IBKXTCW,"The Doyle family might be the quirkiest bunch of people that ever solved a mystery and their seldom discreet, occasionally bizarre ways of getting the job done are fun to watch.
Jake Doyle and his dad Malachy run a small detective agency in St. John's, Newfoundland. That should tell you right away that this isn't your average, run-of-the-mill mystery series. Both Jake and Malachy are ex-cops so the detecting business does come sort of naturally but, that aside, they are anything but ordinary. Jake is married to a beautiful doctor but they're in the middle of divorce proceedings. He meets a very pretty cop while on a case and, given his impulsive nature and a ready eye for the ladies, he immediately sets about wooing her. Meanwhile, he and his wife still find time for some intimate moments, which they both agree is not good for them and yet...
The mysteries are nicely written and episodes contain not only drama but also humor and warmth. This series has sometimes been referred to as a Canadian version of the ""Rockford Files"" and that's not far off the mark. Like Jim Rockford, Jake Doyle would prefer not to fight if he can talk his way out of things, he drives a muscle car (Rockford had a Firebird, Jake has a GTO) and he can solve a crime... sometimes when he's been accused of committing it.
In the mood for something a little different that's set in one of the prettiest cities in North America?

Jake Doyle (played by Allan Hawco) is a private investigator who loves women, but can't commit to any of them -- not even his ""soon to be ex wife.""  His partner is his father, Malachy (played by Sean McGinley).  Jake always seems to get beat up in ever episode.  Don't misunderstand me, the show is not very violent -- it's actually funny.  There are 12 episodes in the first Season -- a lot more than you get on most British series.  The only drawback is that there are no subtitles, but they're Canadian so the accent is not hard to understand.  I highly recommend this series.",1404518400,3,651,4.4576271186440675

The series is fast-paced with banter, some of it crass, with sexual innuendos.  Might want to watch it after the children go to bed.

The fresh, witty dialogue gives us a window into the family, the mysteries are way more interesting than the repetitious shootings-stabbings-etc from certain crime shows, and Doyle proves that a crime drama does not have to have violence and gunplay to crack the cases.

6256574,1,B00IBKXTCW,"Despite the description, this DVD does NOT have subtitles.  It is closed-captioned, but as our tv does not show ccs, this DVD is useless to us.  I contacted Amazon and they refunded my account on receipt of the returned DVD.  I'm sorry to leave a review that is not about the show, but people need to be warned.",1401235200,2,311,4.327586206896552
6256575,3,B00IBKXTCW,We really enjoy the storylines and the humor but have ben disappointed with the bad words and the sexual insinuations as well as underage sex.  Graphic sex scenes have no place in this series.,1400630400,2,192,4.647058823529412
6256576,3,B00IBKXTCW,"Only watched the first DVD of season 1, but already I find there is too much whining between Jake and ex-wife and I am no prude, but really, bedding every client that comes along????? I saw some reviews that say it gets better after season one, but I'll reserve my judgment, will try and watch the rest of season 1 and go from there!
Let's face it , in the real world running a business that way would be very compromising!!! I'll adjust my review when I'm done with season 1!!!!!!",1400112000,3,481,4.2967032967032965
6256577,3,B00IBKXTCW,It is amusing but even with closed captioning it is hard to follow.  Characters should slow down in their speeches.  It would have made the lines as they are delivered more pointed.  I did not find the story line wildly different from others.,1396828800,2,242,4.5813953488372094
6256578,5,B00IBKXTCW,"LOL amid the suspenseful fast action. This 21st century St John's Newfoundland Det Agency drama is as fast with comedy as cars. Expect little integrity with younger Jake Doyle (Allan Hawco, originator-star-writer-ex prod). Pa Malachy Sean McGinley) has his hands full in the son and his own live-in mate Rose (Lynda Boyd). Older viewers will ogle Jakes GTO with duel-carb air scoop hood. Good writing that brings out a crazy character cast. Beautiful St. John's filmed setting is a thrill in itself. 3 generations of Doyles makes this fun viewing for teens to retirees.
If viewers like this set that aired in 2010 as much as I did, leave reviews. This Canadian series has been ongoing there for 5 seasons. I want more DVD seasons.

6256579,5,B00IBKXTCW,I happened to catch this show in re-runs here and there on TV and wanted to see a whole season. It does not disappoint.,1394150400,,119,4.0
6256580,5,B00IBKXTCW,"This show is really great! It's fast paced and the characters fit their roles nicely. If you like any of the action / ""who done it"" shows on USA Network, this show is just as good, but with more bar fights.",1390953600,,206,4.048780487804878
6256581,4,B00IBKXTCW,"A friend of mine recommended this series and, because we have very similar taste in what series and movies we watch,  I picked up Season 1.  Its okay - the main character is a little shallow but my friend says it gets better after Season 1.  She let me borrow her Season 2 but I have not started it yet.  I guess time will tell if this new series grows on me.",1389657600,,359,3.9444444444444446
6256582,5,B00IBKXTCW,"I was born in St. John's but left when I was 2; just went back to visit for the first time last month; saw this series for sale in every tourist shop but looked online and saw I could buy it cheaper here from Amazon, so I waited until I got back home. Have finished Season 1 & am watching Season 2 now. The shots in and around St. John's are so classic, and this show really captures the feeling of St. John's. It has been a lot of fun to watch. The characters, plot, and story line are intelligent, witty and fun. Will definitely be getting subsequent seasons. Don't know yet whether I can find any way to watch current episodes online but I sure hope so.",1378252800,,656,4.1328125
6256583,5,B00IBKXTCW,My husband and I often find that the series we like are cancelled after only a year. We loved Terriers for instance. Our family loved Due South and Slings and Arrows and when my husband saw some reviews of this and we saw it was set in Newfoundland we had to try it. Half way through watching the first season we ordered the next two. We watch it with our 15 year old daughter and it is a lot of fun. My husband's family is from Newfoundland and the characters seem very familiar. It is also tempting us to move there. We really like it.,1372550400,2,537,4.123809523809523

to keep you entertained.  How father and son play off each other and then mix in the father's new wife, the son's girlfriends and
the sister and other characters it is an amusing series.",1487376000,,313,4.288135593220339

8640675,4,B00IBKXTCW,"Takes a bit of getting used to...but it kinda grows on you. Definitely not your run of the mill detective series and St John Newfoundland has some beautiful scenery. Was pretty popular as it went for six seasons! Coincidentally, early in my USAF career, as a second lieutenant, I was on orders to transfer to St Johns...even contacted the VW dealer to see if I could buy a new one when I arrived, but the orders were cancelled and I went to the UK, instead. Lucky me as that's where I met my dearly departed wife and love, Beryl.",1485388800,,529,4.353535353535354
