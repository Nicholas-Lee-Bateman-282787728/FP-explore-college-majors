5903644,4,B00ECVPOZO,"I don't do gratuitous violence and gore. I've neither the patience nor the stomach to sit through most horror flicks... whether chainsaws, vampires or creatures, etc. Though ""Big Ass Spider"" stole every creature feature cliche ever used this movie was still worth a watch since it never takes itself seriously and the result was genuinely funny. I can think of far worse ways to spend 90 or so minutes. Might be a little much for the young kiddies but 12 and up will see it for what it is and get the joke.",1383955200,,506,4.451612903225806
5903645,4,B00ECVPOZO,"It's a fun, entertaining movie! Great chemistry between the main characters. I laughed a lot! No heavy subtext, just a straightforward good time, with a giant spider!",1383696000,2,166,5.185185185185185

5903647,4,B00ECVPOZO,"Not your typical scary movie. Greg Grunberg was in classic form, as was the entire cast.  A little scary, very funny!  A very pleasant surprise!",1382918400,2,144,4.72
5903648,5,B00ECVPOZO,"This movie was great, it was intended to be a B movie comedy but I think it will become a cult classic for years to come. Fantastic idea making it available on demand and online streaming from the release date. Highly recommend this film.",1382918400,2,238,4.431818181818182
5903649,4,B00ECVPOZO,"If you like monster movies, or giant monster movies, or especially giant monster movies featuring spiders then this movie should be on your watchlist.  I will be recommending this movie to friends, especially those who like movies like Tremors or Eight Legged Freaks.

5903650,4,B00ECVPOZO,"I would describe ""BAS"" as a SyFy movie-of-the-week with way better production values.  As you can guess from the title, this movie is firmly tounge-in-cheek, never taking itself seriously.  This makes for great popcorn-eating, monster-fighting fun.  It's well worth your time!",1382227200,4,276,5.682926829268292
5903651,5,B00ECVPOZO,This is a very fun movie.  The actors were great and there was some creative filming.  I'm beginning to think that the low budget films are WAY better than the CGI big bill features.,1382140800,5,182,4.323529411764706
5903652,5,B00ECVPOZO,Just because I star in this movie does not mean that I am biased. I watched it with a completely open mind. My mind was completely opened and I was completely drunk. It's one of the best movies ever made.  We had a blast making it and I really hope you enjoy it.  @GregGrunberg,1381968000,99,277,4.111111111111111
5903653,5,B00ECVPOZO,"I will admit I may be a biased with my review but I will say that this film is really, really fun ride.  If you like to laugh and love creature features, you are going to enjoy this film.  It is a totally entertaining buddy comedy about an exterminator and a security guard who team up to take down the world's largest spider.  Set in LA, the film moves really fast and gives you lots of funny and suspenseful moments.  I recommend you take a look.  It is not Men in Black in terms of budget, but it makes up for it on so many other levels.",1379289600,32,540,4.009345794392523

5903662,3,B00ECVPOZO,"This was so not funny except for Jose.  Still not worth the watch.  SciFi Channel's special effects are better than this film's CGI.  I fast forwarded through about 40% to catch the action parts which were not worth the fast forwarding.  Ugh.

5903668,5,B00ECVPOZO,"BIG ASS SPIDER opens w/ the titular arachnid destroying Los Angeles. Flashback to 12 hours prior, and the story begins. Exterminator (aka: Pest Eradication Specialist), Alex Mathis (Greg Grunberg) winds up at the hospital, after being bitten by a Brown Recluse spider. While there, Alex's expertise is needed when a morgue worker reports being bitten on the neck by a huge, dinner plate-sized spider. Of course, there's far more going on than meets the eye, and the military, led by Major Braxton C. Tanner (Ray Wise- ROBOCOP), soon arrives, just as a patient is killed by the creature. After it escapes into the sewer system, the game is on! Growing at an impossible rate, the BAS starts consuming unwary humans like popcorn shrimp! Now, Alex and his newfound security guard partner, Jose (Lombardo Boyar) must do their best to aid the military in stopping the behemoth, before it annihilates mankind. BIG ASS SPIDER is one of the best horror / comedy movies since its kindred spirit, ARACHNOPHOBIA. The humor is dead on, the deaths are suitably disgusting, and the low-budget special effects are fantastic! If you love monsters, 50's big bug movies, or cheeeze that actually works, then this film will be a fear feast! Highly recommended... Also contains a great cameo from Lin Shaye (INSIDIOUS 1-4)!...",1493078400,2,1305,5.018433179723503
5903669,5,B00ECVPOZO,"Nothing like a well done B movie. It's funny, sexy, creepy, good special effects. The dialog is adolescent and dry and the acting is just below par, which is what makes it such a good B flick. This ranks with Sharknado and zombeaver.",1492732800,,233,4.441860465116279

Sure the movie was predictable following a standard format for the genre, but they did it with a wink. The two hero guys were very affable making them very enjoyable to watch. I love the homage to Troma films with the cameo appearance and then eaten Stanley Lloyd Kaufman, Jr. I've watched a lot of other films where I wished for my hour and a half back, not this one.",1491436800,,524,4.048076923076923

5903685,4,B00ECVPOZO,"This movie is pure Grade B all the way, but in a good way.  Don't expect a Hollywood blockbuster out of this one.

That having been said, I generally go into these type of movies with extremely low expectations, which is to its advantage.  My hopes are never high.
It actually got me to laugh out loud in a couple of places.  Other reviewers are right when they point to the actor playing Jose as one of the bright points of the film.  Here's an example:

The exterminator's truck has been stopped by the police for speeding.
Alex: ""Keep quiet; I'll do all the talking.""
Jose: ""I hope so.  You're the white guy.""

The actor playing Alex strikes me as trying to be a poor man's Vince Vaughn.  (This is NOT a compliment.)  I'd still give him another watch in another picture, though. The other actors were just average.

The special effects were about the same as a video game.  Not horrible, but you can easily tell they're fake.  The spider model wasn't bad, like a cross between the Alien Queen's crest, and the Predator's mouth combined to make its head.  Someone else said it first, and I agree- this is like a Sci-Fi Channel original, but watchable..heck, even enjoyable.  Even *without* Bruce Campbell...  ;)

Take it for what it is, and you won't be disappointed.",1491264000,9,1269,4.54424778761062
5903686,4,B00ECVPOZO,"If you enter Big Ass Spider expecting a serious discussion about arachnids--or anything for that matter--you should seriously take a step back, look at the title and re-examine your life expectations. This movie has its funny moments, a few scares and on a whole is a good ""budget film"". Its not winning any awards for acting or special effects, but it can keep you entertained on a weekday afternoon.",1491264000,,401,4.826086956521739

I will probably watch this again soon with my 16 year old nephew!",1491177600,2,253,4.122448979591836
5903690,2,B00ECVPOZO,"This was almost too painful to watch. The only reason why I gave it an extra star was for the CGI details of the spider. Other than that, this movie SUCKED. The actors were horrible (minus Jose - He was amusing), the other CGI was crap (helicopters, stabbing of people with the legs, etc...), the military tactics were beyond retarded, and the emotional reactions throughout the film resembled that of a drooling toddler (no real feelings of terror, fear, panic, etc...)

OHHHH, and the absurdity that renegade exterminator was the only clown in the video that could kill the spider, despite the Army SOF being on scene and having the capability to use the General Atomics MQ- Predator Drone.",1491004800,,692,4.815126050420168

The Hero's star Greg Grunberg ""I live to kill"" is perfect in this. He is an exterminator who is just trying to work off his hospital bill when he encounters the spider from hell, the spider who won't stop growing. As you guessed from the title, it's a big ass'ed spider. I highly recommend this for great family fun. Worth every penny.

This movie, though, was so unoriginal to me because I was the one who came up with the story. I was dropping my mom off at the morgue when I was chatting with the morgician when a spider tiptoed toward him and bit his shirt. He wasn't hurt by the attack but I told him that a huge spider terrorizing the world would make a great movie. On my way out, I noticed someone hiding under a blanket who must've heard my whole idea, so maybe they colluded to steal my story. What they wrote was unoriginal and predictable--thoroughly leaving an unsatisfying feeling in my mouth. The best part of the movie was the very beginning with the incredible piano song.

5903728,5,B00ECVPOZO,"I  first saw part of this film on the Sci Fi  channel; I liked what I saw and ordered the DVD from Amazon.  This movie was even better than I had
expected, with a pretty good cast, superior special effects, especially blending CGI with what appeared to be stop motion animation, and a lot
of humor, which seems to be the norm today in Sci Fi pics since TREMORS.  The action was terrific, with lots of Angelinos getting munched and
buildings being pulverized.  It was a spider banquet in one park (Griffith?) and LA's tallest building turned into a spider baby berthing hospital.  I
thought the producers did a magnificent job blending the giant bug images in with live action street and building scenes.  This certainly is one of
the better movies that has come along for television in some time.  Sort of a companion to GRABBERS which I loved.  And Chubbo the hero got

The spider is actually scarier in it's smaller phases, but that's to be expected.

5903738,5,B00ECVPOZO,"There is something special about a well made creature feature.  Sure, ScyFy originals are fun, partially because they have no budget and the special effects are somewhat... lacking.  But this movie, not being a ScyFy original, about a Big Ass Spider (love the name!!!) actually had some funds set aside for special effects!  And the script seemed somewhat polished!  The acting looked like the actors had some experience.  Except for the crowds of people running screaming - they looked like someone had posted a flyer for people to show up some weekend and run around and scream - no experience needed.  That was great.

This is a movie about a science project gone awry.  Of course.  Aren't they all?  And the result escapes into the city and causes havoc and death.  And an unexpected hero (and his loveable sidekick) show up to save the day, complete with wisecracks and implausible situations.  And of course there's a happy ending.

5903748,5,B00ECVPOZO,"I've always been a big sci-fi fan, books and movies. Perhaps because I started my love  of sci-fi from books, when I was young, the main thing I enjoyed in a movie was the story. But as I grew older, I began to learn more about, and appreciate, things like plot integrity, acting, directing, photography, etc.

If you're a person who only enjoys the story, as I used to be, then Big Ass Spider will probably strike you as a well done 'B' sci-fi movie. If you don't enjoy strongly tongue-in-cheek humor, you may not enjoy it.

But if you do, and have learned to appreciate more subtle production qualities in movies, Big Ass Spider will be an absolute delight! The script, acting, directing, innuendo, down to the tiny nuances, are dead on!  I rarely laugh out loud when watching movies, but this one had me in stitches. For the first time ever, in scene after scene, I asked myself ""how could this have possibly been done better?""

Clearly, the producer & director purposely chose a typical 'B' sci-fi movie story as their vehicle, and then they nailed it to the wall! The special effects are typical 'B' movie effects. But, in my opinion, a $100 million SFX budget would actually be a negative here, because, just like every other detail, it perfectly matches the chosen theme and style.

Unfortunately, some of the people who have reviewed this movie missed the point. This movie was clearly made with tongue firmly in cheek. The apparent 'flaws' are there intentionally, for humor.

I highly and enthusiastically recommend this movie, and extend my unbridled admiration and appreciation to those who made it!",1422576000,6,1611,4.752688172043011

5903754,4,B00ECVPOZO,"Big monster movies seem to be coming back into vogue. ""The Host"", ""Cloverfield"", ""Godzilla"" et al have had a significant box office impact. So here we take that genre and play it light. The results are mixed but I'm erring on the side of ""see it"" because this kind of fun is too rare in film.

Here's the scoop. Ace pest exterminator Alex Mathis (Greg Grunberg) makes a call, on his day off, to an eccentric client This sets off a string of events that pits his exterminating prowess against the likes of a spider the size of a house. Can he kill the spider, get the girl and win the day?

This is a lot of fun. There are a serious number of horror flicks out there (""The Blob"", ""Slither"" ""Fright Night"" et al) that have used humor to relieve some of the tension building in the story. This though is clearly played for the yuks. Our hero, Alex, is a hapless sort. He's not a young kid and, try as he might, can't seem to hook up with a suitable woman. His clumsy attempts at pick-up lines are laughable. And as he recruits the Latino security guard from the hospital, the play between the two is fun to behold. But, on the serious side, he knows pests and now he even has a leg up on the government forces when it comes to trying to deal with the elusive arachnid.

They do a decent job in meting out the story points and back story on how this monster spider came into being. There were a couple of scenes that made me a bit uncomfortable. One was, in my view, more than a bit racist. It was footage of some local east L.A. types telling the news camera what they saw. They were depicted as stereotypically moronic beyond the meaning of the word. There was also a bit of sexism prevalent. Not all young women are that shapely and run around in ultra-revealing swimwear. And do female military personnel wear mid-thigh length skirts. Maybe I'm making too much of it but I thought the movie could have done without that.

I've seen Grunberg in a couple of things and never thought that much of him. But here, as our hero Alex, he hit the right notes. It's always good to see Ray Wise in a flick and he doesn't disappoint here. Lombardo Boyar, as Alex's sidekick is a real hoot. Most of the rest of the cast do a decent enough job.

This is good and a lot of fun. What did strike me was that, with a bit more budget and some better writing, this could have been a real contender for box office dollars. As it is, it's way north of ""Sharknado"" but south of, say, ""Slither."" My four stars might be a bit more than it deserves, but it really needs to be seen by fans of the genre.",1420329600,,2576,4.217038539553752

5903757,5,B00ECVPOZO,"The meek shall inherit the earth is a popular saying and Big Ass Spider shows the impact that would happen if one was ever given the chance.  You don't buy or rent a movie with this title or cover and expect it to be faultless in relation to realism with the subject animal or to be realistic in being able to simply kill the thing.  There sort of movies also add in the fun factor when you throw in an actor from a popular TV show who has been sort of typecast as his former character and not been in much since.  In this case it's Greg Grunberg, the cop from Heroes, this time round he's a pest exterminator, who struggling to pay the bills offers to get rid of a spider problem in exchange for free treatment for a regular spider bite in the hospital.

Probably the most famous spiders on a rampage in America film before this was Arachnophobia. You could be critical and say this one has just copied a few of that movie's key scenes but I'd rather like to this they were paying homage. Scenes such as both releasing the spider problem through a body awaiting autopsy and the scene where the kids are playing and one almost gets killed retrieving a ball from behind a tree where the spider is hiding, also has a nice tribute here.

Grunberg does an entertaining job as the main character but it's really the hospital security guard (Lombardo Boyar) who steals the show.

Big Ass Spider is a nice contribution to the deliberately made to be cheesy horror comedy genre, if you're after a terrifying horror film though this one is more one to watch for laughs.",1420156800,,1560,4.380622837370242

5903760,5,B00ECVPOZO,"Im declaring Big Ass Spider! an instant classic.  Seriously, this is the best creature feature film in years.  Along with plenty of scenes showing the arachnid antagonist doing its thing  spinning webs, spraying face-melting acid, eating people left and right, and pretty much terrorizing the city of Los Angeles  you have great characters delivering constantly witty dialogue with great comedic timing.  The combination of Greg Grunberg and Lombardo Boyar as spider-hunting hombres makes for comedic gold.

You would think that being bitten by a brown recluse spider would definitely be the low point of your day  but not so for exterminator Alex Mathis (Greg Grunberg).  That just ends up being the serendipitous event that places him in the local hospital emergency room when the coroner runs in with a hellacious bite from what he describes as a huge spider.  The Ex goes into action, with the help of hospital security guard Jose Ramos (Lombardo Boyar)  and thats when the military rolls in.  It seems this giant spider is no ordinary spider, and  according to the special operations teams scientist  its only at Phase Two of its whole growth/metamorphosis thing.  Its going to get much, much bigger, with a hard exoskeleton that bullets cant penetrate.

The military pushes Alex aside, but he and his new sidekick Jose are determined to find and kill the spider themselves.  They make a great (and very funny) team, routinely figuring out where the spider is as quickly as the military can spot it themselves.  Of course, the big guy isn't exactly lying low  hes terrorizing the streets of Los Angeles.  It is great fun watching this big ass spider on the rampage.  Hes spearing people (including Tromas own Lloyd Kaufman) left and right, shooting out webs to suck people back in to its giant mouth, and gumming some victims up for late night snacks.  I thought the special effects were great, especially considering the movies surprisingly low budget, especially when the spider is terrorizing a park full of unsuspecting men, women, and children, and when he decides to start climbing some of L.A.s tallest buildings.  The whole spider rampage also gives birth to one of the films funniest scenes  a glorious send-up of Antoine Dodsons Bed Intruder news interview.

If you see only one giant spider movie this year, make sure its Big Ass Spider!  The monster action alone is worth watching, but the hilarity the movie unleashes all but demands multiple viewings.",1418860800,,2470,4.995098039215686

5903766,5,B00ECVPOZO,"The only reason this movie has poor reviews is because there are people who want a specific type of horror movie and this doesn't meet their requirements. This movie is NOT a goofy horror like those made by Roger Corman. This movie is 100% spoof, and it's definitely meant to be a satirical comedy with a horror/monster-mash theme to it. The lead character is Greg Grunberg who played Matt Parkman from Heroes (he was the hero with telekinesis/telepathy). He will not smile the at all during the movie but he is very funny. Lombardo Boyar is extremely silly and makes a lot of very funny comic and movie references. It's that type of spoof where they all act very serious while doing very stupid things. I'm certain there were a lot of re-takes given how ridiculous the movie is. The characters are all very silly, genuine, and interact very well. Again, the only reason reviewers could possibly give this less than 3 stars would be because they were expecting something different. This movie is probably silly in similar fashion to ""The Stuff"" and ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes."" A big stretch would be that those who liked the first ""The Toxic Avenger"" minus all of the sexual jokes might like this, but it's really nothing like it but the dry spoofy feel is very similar.

I figured from the title this would be either great or a total dud...well, it's great!  It has every giant-monster-menace cliche ever spoken and manages to weave them all into a workable, very coherent script. There isn't a slow moment and it all flows easily together. The spider is a small cgi masterpiece. The actors are recognizable and playing it tongue-in-cheek and the script totters on the edge of satire without tipping over. There's wholesale slaughter and destruction but most of it is suggested rather than shown. There's even a King Kong-like finish with the spider atop an LA skyscraper with helicopters hovering.

5903790,5,B00ECVPOZO,"Seriously, Interwebz, stop wasting your time and social commentary on Sharknado. You gotta check out Big Ass Spider! From the first moments of the artful slow motion opening, I knew I was in for something potentially fantastic.

Did it premier on the SyFy channel? Are the VFX of the spider climbing King-Kong style up a skyscraper not quite ready for the big screen? Does the Big Kiss at the end feel contrived and completely lacking in chemistry? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!

But what it does have is actors who you recognize, but cant necessarily name, doing a good job and not appearing bored or ashamed; a very tongue-in-cheek sensibility; and a buddy comedy between the loveable, but unlucky in love, exterminator hero and the hospital security guard who becomes his sidekick that had me laughing out loud several times.

And the spider doesnt fly, but its so big-ass that theres a moment it takes a flying leap over the military trucks and we see the POV of the soldiers shooting the soaring abdomen in slo-mo thats totally awesome!

No, its not compelling drama that will have me contemplating my place in the universe or the inevitable rise of our robot overlords, but Ive seen a lot of terrible SyFy movies, and this isn't one of them. A really enjoyable popcorn movie, and a second viewing is in my future.",1400889600,,1321,4.705627705627705

We laughed out loud throughout the film and also had some good old fashioned jump scares.  The opening scene was very well done and atmospheric.

5903796,5,B00ECVPOZO,"At first glance ""Big Ass Spider"" looks like just another entry into the long line of SyFy original monster movies that seem to premiere weekly on TV. And while I'm the first one in line when a new ""Sharktopus"" or ""Sharknado"" pops up on DVD, I always hope for something a little more with these movies.

I got all that I could hope for with ""Big Ass Spider"", Perfectly blending comedy and chills, ""Big Ass Spider"" delivers a film that is packed from opening to ending credits with fun.

Alex, an exterminator is sent to the ER after an encounter with a Brown Recluse spider. While Alex is getting patched up we see a morgue attendant attacked by a large spider in hospital morgue. The morgue attendant comes to the ER with a particularly nasty bite, and explains that he was attacked by something that looked like a huge spider. The exterminator is hired to hunt and kill the spider, and is accompanied by the hospital security guard Jose. Needless to say, the spider escapes the hospital, and continues to grow larger. Toss in some military scientists, a damsel in distress, and several cameos by genre notables, and you have the perfect Saturday Night Creature Feature.

While I really enjoyed the overall story, and the above average special F/X, it's the dynamic between Jose and Alex that really carries the film. I'm really hoping they pair these two together for another adventure as they are just so much fun to watch.

5903811,4,B00ECVPOZO,"It's a movie called ""Big Ass Spider!"" Guess what it's about. You get three guesses, and the first two guesses don't count.

And yes, I had to watch it. With a title like ""Big Ass Spider!,"" who could possibly resist? It's pretty much exactly the movie that that amazing title promises -- a modern B-movie creature feature, centering on a monstrous spider that just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And while you might initially suspect that it's a SyFy-style disaster, it's also a very well-made film.

It opens in the middle of a scene you'd expect of such a movie -- a blimp-sized spider destroying a skyscraper, while helicopters buzz around helplessly. Exterminator Alex Mathis (Greg Grunberg) watches helplessly, while Storm Large's hauntingly pretty cover of ""Where Is My Mind?"" plays.

Skip back to a day before. In the middle of an autopsy, a rat-sized spider crawls out of a corpse and attacks the mortician. Alex happens to be there getting a spider-bite treated, so he's willing to handle the giant spider if they drop his bill. Along with security guard Jose (Lombardo Boyar), he ventures into the depths of the hospital... only to find that the spider has gotten much, much bigger. Also, it can melt off your face.

Then a Special Forces unit shows up to take over the hospital, trying to find and lock down the spider before it can get any bigger. Big shock: they fail, and the spider becomes larger and larger, killing countless people as it goes. It falls to Alex, with his encyclopedic knowledge of spiders and their ways, to find a way to take it down before it has a bunch of spider babies!

""Big Ass Spider!"" basically wants to be a modern version of those 1950s creature movies with giant bugs and spiders. In that way, it succeeds -- it avoids being campy or overly silly, but still sticks earnestly to the ""giant spider destroys everything"" plotline that is so hard to pull off. Admittedly it could have been a bit more self-aware of its goofy storyline, but it's pretty fun.

But there is plenty of quick clever dialogue (""Your Spanglish is pressuring me!"") and some tongue-in-cheek humor (Alex decides to ram the spider with his pickup truck), keeping the pace going between action scenes. And yes, there are plenty of scenes of people being squished, melted and swarmed by the acid-spewing, hyper-webbing Big Ass Spider.

It should also be noted that this is a pretty low-budget movie; director Mike Mendez couldn't afford a casting director, so he actually cast people from his Facebook friends list. Considering that budget, the special effects are pretty decent -- the spider is no Shelob, but it's good for what it is, and it has a certain Harryhausen charm. Plus, it's fun to see it repeatedly stabbing people with its spearlike legs.

The actors all do a pretty decent job -- Grunberg is a fairly nice everyman hero, as the only one who knows enough about spiders to track the Big Ass Spider! down. Lin Shaye is a bit wooden at times (""I'm stuck"") but is a serviceable hard-nosed love interest, while Boyar manages to be comic relief without being ridiculous. Perennial cult star Ray Wise (you know, the devil from ""Reaper"") also gives us a nice performance as the harried Special Forces general.

In other words, if the SyFy Channel's slapdash careless approach to creature features annoys you, this may be a welcome break. A fun, unpretentious B-movie that gives you what you want: a big ass spider!",1393459200,13,3432,4.764309764309765

5903813,5,B00ECVPOZO,"Pure awesomeness!  Rarely will you find a film, particularly a comedy, which combines near-perfect writing with near-perfect direction with near-perfect acting.  But ""Big Ass Spider"" (BAS) seems to be the perfect storm.  But in a very good way.

I did something that I rarely do:  buy a movie.  But I wanted to see BAS -- the reviews were really high from the critics, and I had seen a promo that looked really good -- and so when I went to rent this, I realized that for about twice the price, I could own this bad boy.  And if you think about it, if you go to a movie theater -- something that I haven't done in about four years, as it seems to be more dangerous than the spider in this film, what with people getting shot for doing minor things such as texting -- and there are at least two of you, it costs, what?  like 12 bucks?  And that would be a matinee without any goodies.  For $9.99 I can burn a hole in my Comcast monthly download maximum as many times as I want watching this laugh-fest.  At least up to my 250 gigs.

So, while sitting in the safety of my own home, not having to worry about some other theater-goer going all postal on me. . . I got to sit back and see all of the awesomeness.  Sure, the spider is pretty Bad Ass, and said spider is pretty big, but I'm assuming that, unlike the film ""The Ring"" as an example, that same spider can't come through the screen and eat my face like that mean little girl with unresolved mommy issues.  But I can sit back, eat some popcorn, and watch that spider eat other peoples' faces, and I can laugh.

And you'll laugh plenty here too, just like I did, if you rent this film.  Better yet:  why not buy it?  It's only twice as much, and you'll get to witness pure awesomeness.  Over and over.",1392768000,3,1755,4.1850746268656716

His character is not unlike John Goodman's exterminator in Arachnophobia.  Grunberg just isn't as funny or credible in a lead role that requires a lot of heroism and comedy.  Every scene he's not in, soars.  Every scene he is in, plummets.  Loved the spider, couldn't stand him.  On the other hand, his unofficial sidekick (Lombardo Boyar) was funny and knew exactly how not to overplay his lines.  The problem with this film is half of it was way too serious, while the other half tried too hard to be a crazy with humor.  It lacked balance.  But the spider was cool.  And all the requisite fright was delivered with the use of jump-scares (they're cheap shots but they do the job).  The FX was fantastic.  As a fan of creature features, I did like this movie.

Well, I recently obtained ""Sharknado"", so I had to try something without tornado-related stuff (though it was tempting). Hmmm....but what if it was about stoned idiots trying to figure out DOS? Whatever; silly movies...silly 'joke'/idea.

People seem to not mention that the star-ratings here at AMAZON have a meaning. 4 stars means that ""I like it"" and 5 is ""I love it"". They are individual for each person and are the viewer's opinion, having nothing to do with the quality of the movie. So, I give ""Big Ass Spider!"" easily 4 stars because I liked it and had a pretty-good time shutting my brain off for a bit.

What I didn't like was the packaging. From the ""Wal-mart"", it has the ass-part in the title covered over like some spray-painted on it and is called ""Biggest Spider!"". In small letters under, we see ""AKA Big Ass Spider!"". It's part of the packaging and not something that someone did on their own, but it's still pointless and ruins it.

Yup. All of those. It would be very easy to pick this one apart on the grounds of physics, character development, and a street map of L.A. But if you are sitting down to watch a movie with this title, you're going to get what you asked for. The first scene is actually very lovely and roped me in immediately, which is a very good sign. And then it built nicely in size, scares, and humor -- with a sprinkling of gore and horror, not too much, and on into some cool Big Bug thrills.

I would never argue with anyone who hates it or picks it apart -- but if you like big monster movies (i.e., if you think ""Them!"" is an under appreciated gem), than you should have a fine time. I sure did.

5903827,4,B00ECVPOZO,"I have always had a soft spot for those old, giant bug films like Them, and Tarantula.  Those schlocky sci-fi/horrors of the 1950s were often unintentionally funny but always entertaining.  Big Ass Spider is a throwback to those films but with a Tremors style brand of humor.  Greg Gunberg (Heroes) stars as Alex Mathis, an exterminator who specializes in getting into the heads of spiders.  Mathis ends up at a hospital after being bit by one of his prey.  The military arrives on the scene with Ray Wise as Major Tanner and Clare Kramer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) as Lieutenant Brant, looking for a body that was delivered to the morgue in error.

The body was home to a spider, genetically manipulated with microbes found in Martian soil which cause the spider to grow exponentially.  Mathis, and hospital security guard Jose (Boyar) team-up to hunt down the arachnid, unaware of its true nature.  The spider grows from the size of a small dog, to the size of a man, to that of a large dinosaur as it wreaks destruction in downtown Los Angeles.  As the military fails to control the giant spider, it is up to Alex and Jose to kill the beast before it can lay its eggs.

Big Ass Spider is heavily influenced by both Arachnophobia and Tremors, both of which are superior films.  Its special effects are strictly Sy-Fy Channel quality and this would be the type of film you would expect to find on that network were it not for the quality of the cast.  Grundberg and Boyer are the most enjoyable monster-hunting team to come along since Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon joined forces for Tremors in 1990.  They share playing straight man and comic foil equally and deliver more laughs than the film has a right.

Ray Wise and his electric smile never fail to entertain.  While he might not be believable as a military commander he still commands every scene he is in.  The always wacky Lin Shaye has bit role as Alexs favorite customer.  Legendary cult film Producer/director/actor, and founder of Troma Studios, Lloyd Kaufman, has a cameo as a jogger who runs afoul of the giant arachnid.

Big Ass Spider isn't a film you want to sit down and over analyze as there are plot points you can drive holes through and sub-par CGI.  The first 20 minutes are far too similar to Arachnophobia before it finally finds its own legs.  This is the type of film you just sit back and enjoy the ride and move on.  The film had a limited theatrical release and will be available on blu-ray and DVD on January 7.

5903828,4,B00ECVPOZO,"Nine Things about the Movie Big Ass Spider!

1. This enjoyable, ultra-low budget Z-movie is kind of like those movies made for the SyFy Channel, except better.

2. Its about, well, a big ass spider.

3. A spider eats its way out of a dead body at a hospital, and goes on a rampage, growing really fast, making webs, and spitting acid on people.

4. A goofy exterminator named Alex and a Mexican security guard named Jose find themselves competing with the military to find and kill the spider.

5. The movie clearly wasn't trying to take itself serious. It knows exactly what it is, and revels in it. As proof that the director knows what he was making, Lloyd Kaufman has a cameo (if you don't know who Lloyd Kaufman is, don't worry about it. It would take too long to explain).

6. The budget is so low that apparently the director actually cast the film from his Facebook friends. The special effects are pretty bad, except for the spider. I think all the money went to making the spider. It looks pretty cool.

7. Its also really funny. The main characters, Alex and Jose, have a great chemistry and comic timing.

8. Its an homage to other monster movies, and you can find references to many other films here.

9. If you are expecting an actual horror monster movie, you will hate this. But if you're in the mood for a stupid-smart, good-natured monster comedy, then this is something youll want to check out.",1390435200,,1413,4.48828125
5903829,4,B00ECVPOZO,Maybe this movie should be a 3 but I came in expecting so much worse and was pleasantly surprised.  The intro made me want to stop watching but it had some laughs after that.,1390089600,,174,4.117647058823529
5903830,4,B00ECVPOZO,Very funny and campy. No gore or frightening parts for 11 years and up. We watched it twice it was so ridiculous.,1390089600,,113,4.181818181818182
5903831,5,B00ECVPOZO,"I saw the first three minutes of Big Ass Spider! on You Tube. I was impressed with what I saw, but I really didn't think the movie could maintain the level of scares throughout. I was wrong, thank goodness! I yelled out during the morgue scene with the clueless hospital employee. The scenes in the air ducts with Greg Grunberg and the scurrying arachnid gave me the willies, and big Spidey's rampage in the park was terrifying. Big Ass Spider delivered, even when it was clearly toying with the audience. That scene with the little girl retrieving her ball is the first example one that comes to mind.

Speaking of Grunberg, he was perfect in this movie. He gives a truly Oscar winning performance, Golden Globe caliber at the very least. It's always a pleasure to see Ray Wise on screen, and Lombardo Boyar cracked me up with his reaction to all the horrific stuff going on: ""Just describe it to me---I don't wanna see it!"" Boyar and Grunberg have real chemistry. I wouldn't mind seeing them work together again in a sequel.

If you're looking for a scary movie that also delivers big time laughs, look no further than Big Ass Spider!

Greg, you can send the check for the amount we discussed to my Swiss bank account. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.

No, seriously, I really enjoyed this movie. No strings attached, and no bribes.",1389744000,,1347,4.6

I'm a huge fan of all types if horror and the animal films from the 80s is all I thought about while what hong this flick . The spider in this actually has a kind of personality to him and sets up traps for people as it continues to get big , bigger, and then BIG ASS SPIDER MODE , like I always say I don't give spoilers so if u have nothing to do and u are able to stream this little gem then by all means check it out .",1389744000,,505,3.685185185185185

5903835,5,B00ECVPOZO,"Based on the title, the plot of this one is not hard to figure out. There are some great cameos (Lin Shaye) and some good performances by veteran actors (Ray Wise, Patrick Bauchau) and that gives it a little more kick. Greg Grunberg is just perfect for the lead role, as an exterminator who claims to have the ability to ""think like a spider and get inside their heads.""

5903841,4,B00ECVPOZO,"Now by contrast, BIG ASS SPIDER! is how you do a comedy monster movie!! Starring Greg Grunberg and Lombardo Boyar (who is freaking brilliant, and funny as hell, in this film), the story is simple: an alien species the government has been studying, for possible future use as a weapon, gets away and runs amok in Los Angeles. A normal-sized spider that grows massively huge the more it kills, the arachnid - while still small - comes under the watchful gaze of Alex Mathis (Grunberg), an exterminator specializing in the habits and toxicology of arachnids, who tries killing it before realizing just what he has on its hands. But soon is becomes so huge, so unstoppable, that even when a crack military team sent by the U.S. government can't stop it, it falls to Alex and a security guard named Jose (Boyar) to save downtown Los Angeles. This film is HILARIOUS, nearly every line that comes out of Boyar's mouth alone a gem, and with perfect grade-B special effects and just the right amount of blood and gore, BIG ASS SPIDER! is one of the best ways to laugh and jump scare through a couple of hours that I've come across in a long time.",1387238400,,1137,4.5512195121951216

5903844,4,B00ECVPOZO,"Exterminator Alex Mathis (Greg Grunberg) likes women and loathes fruitcake. Through a series of improbable circumstances he gets to fight an aggressive BA spider along side of the US military with a Mexican sidekick.

In a number of scenes Grunberg reminded me of Kevin James and I had a few John Goodman flashbacks. The film had blood and cheesy props (notice the thanks to Lloyd Kaufman in the credits) . The ""horror"" aspect simply didn't exist. Overly accomplished, relatively unknown Clare Kramer provided the love interest.

Great for cheese lovers.

5903846,5,B00ECVPOZO,This movie is more like Shaun of The Dead than Sharknado. The director combined comedy with the right amount of scare and sci-fi so the movie is funny without crossing the line to being a spoof or making fun of the genre. It's actually quite clever and make references to old classic and even include an old school Rider of The Lost Ark face melt!,1385078400,,347,4.3538461538461535

I will admit that I was skeptical about BAS, thinking that just like so many other movies, the trailer showed it all; but I gave BAS a chance, and I am glad I did.

Watch the trailer.  Simply put:  If you don't like the trailer, you will not like the movie.  On the other hand, if you are entertained by the trailer or enjoy the Big Bug movies from the 50s and 60s (Them, Beginning of the End, Praying Mantis), give BAS a try as I don't think you'll be disappointed in this movie that reminds me of those movies I watched way back when I lived in Vailsburg, NJ.",1384992000,,786,4.178807947019868

Finally we get a monster show whose title is not the usual crypto-mysterious enigma wrapped in a conundrum of a riddle; a reference I swear is totally definitely not about the super-serious Pacific Rim. These guys just state the facts, ma'am; that we got ourselves a Big Ass Spider. How can anyone not respect such truthiness?

So, what do you get when mixing a witty genius spider-whisperer, his faithful funny sidekick El Loco, a pitch-perfect desperate-but-manly army general, a mad I-warned-you-guys scientist with a British accent and a Big Ass Nod to the real Antoine Dodson who saved his real sister from a real monster in real life? Why, you get Big Ass AWESOME of course!

By the way...since the Big Ass Spider was a girl, perhaps calling her Big Ass every 2 seconds is what made her cranky?  But hey I'm no big-ass-spider-whisperer, so whatevs.
