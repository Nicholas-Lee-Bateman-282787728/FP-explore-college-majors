8648663,5,B00J7ZKSEC,"One of my favorite Japanese Drama series. My wife and I really enjoyed watching this series. It is nice subtle scenes and beautiful story. It also is nice to be taken back to Japan during the Edo period. The only disappointment is that this DVD set does not include the second season, which has the story conclusion. I'm not sure where to find that.",1472688000,,349,4.46875

8648665,4,B00J7ZKSEC,good ninja series.  It features a husband who is a scholar and his wife is a ninja who is spying on him.  This series may not have a whole lot of action but it has suspense and strategy.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to see corruption uncovered.,1415750400,2,259,4.14
