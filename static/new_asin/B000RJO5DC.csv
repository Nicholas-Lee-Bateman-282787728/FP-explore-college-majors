8201062,5,B000RJO5DC,"I don't understand all the harsh reviews.  I watched this and found it entertaining from start to finish.  The acting was top notch, casting spot on and it was just a fun story.  Yeah, okay, it's not Princess Bride, this PG-13 movie is definitely targeting an adult audience, looking back with nostalgia at High School.  I was somewhat hesitant to watch this movie after all the critical comments, but it seemed to me the critics were looking for something to entertain or educate their children.  I'm looking for pure escapism to entertain myself, and this did it.  I'm adding it to my list of favorite comedy movies so I can go back and watch it again in a couple of years.  Other personal favorites on my list of comedy movies to re-watch include: Idiocracy, Office Space, Groundhog Day, Knight and Day, Hot Tub Time Machine, Mr. Destiny, Back to the Future, Romancing the Stone, 17 Again, Bowfinger, Dodgeball, Galaxy Quest, Tommy Boy and Better Off Dead.",1411862400,2,959,4.740963855421687

8201064,2,B000RJO5DC,ok i am a parent who thought that this would be a good movie to teach my son about lieing. i saw what other people wrote so i bought it and watched it with him. the movie hade a good story about what happend when you lie and get caught up in it which is a good thing. why i gave it a poor grade is because in his wish the teacher in the movie and the populer girl in the movie he wished that they were in love with him and the teacher and the girl were throwing them at this little boy all the way through the movie until the end when things went back to normal. now like i said this movie hade a good story about lieing but i didn't like the part with the teacher and the girl. i thought if you have someone that just saw that part and didn't get it than it sent the wrong message. like i said i am a parent with a teeage boy and i didn't like that part. so be aware of it before you buy it.,1331078400,3,892,3.7
8201065,2,B000RJO5DC,"I didn't really have high hopes coming into this movie. It had it's moments, but, overall, it was cheesy, corny, and just not great.",1223856000,,132,4.541666666666667
8201066,2,B000RJO5DC,"With teen movies about geeks in high school just trying to catch a break and be at least tolerated, some movies excel (Can't Buy Me Love, Three O Clock High, Pretty in Pink, and the stellar 10 things I Hate About You) some are reasonably acceptable (She's All That, Jawbreaker)and then there are those that try really hard but end up just as geeky as their star nerd. Full Of It falls into this final category. While the movie does have it's moments of clever fun, the whole thing is ruined by a young and talented actor (Pinkston) who injects way too much slapstickiness into his role. He is giddily foppish at best and hopelessly silly at worst. Still, the film does have a certain charm in it's message, although the viewer shouldn't have to feel like they are watching a three stooges movie to get it. 2.25 stars",1221350400,,816,4.483221476510067

Sam Leonard is a 17-year-old pipsqueak who looks more like an incoming freshman than an outgoing senior.  Newly arrived at Bridgeport High, Sam suffers the slings and arrows of abuse and ridicule on a daily basis - until, that is, he figures out that the way to get the ""cool"" kids to like him is to concoct elaborate fabrications about virtually every aspect of his really quite humdrum life.  The problem is that one day all the lies he has been telling mysteriously start coming true - with decidedly disastrous results for Sam and all those around him.  In true parabolic fashion, Sam is finally forced to concede that honesty may in fact be the best policy when it comes to winning friends, influencing people and getting what one really wants out of life.

""Full of It"" is a bush-league morality tale that uses magical realism to make its point.  Yet, while youngsters may be amused by some of the wish-fulfillment aspects of the plot and even edified by the little lessons about life that Sam learns along the way, concerned parents should note that a certain overall sleaziness in the tone may make this less than ideal viewing for the average pre-teen.  Adults, on the other hand - whether sleazy or not - will be pretty much unengaged by the whole thing.  Though, if the truth be told, the movie does have a few genuinely clever moments scattered amidst all the distasteful and dull ones, as well as a denouement that really is pretty darn funny.

As Annie, the sole member of the student body who befriends Sam, Kate Mara (memorable as Heath Ledger's daughter in ""Brokeback Mountain"") brings such a transcendent warmth and depth to her character that she seems to be performing in a whole other movie entirely (one can almost sense the actress's impatience at bursting the bonds of the material so she can move onto better things).  Ryan Pinkston is somewhat less impressive as the benighted Sam, though he does have a certain boyish charm that comes across well on screen.",1215129600,3,1990,4.70893371757925
8201068,5,B000RJO5DC,"Ok,so it's not a masterpiece. However,it is a movie trying to have a little fun. My son really liked it. I think maybe not for everyone. Just watch and enjoy. I liked it.",1200096000,7,170,4.181818181818182
8201069,1,B000RJO5DC,"This repellent little film features a lead character devoid of any vestige of charisma.  What could've been a rootable and sympathetic moral tale is instead some kind of twisted fable without a center and a Hobbit like hero sinking into a meaningless vortex.  In other words, this movie stinks and the smell lingers long after the final fade out.",1190764800,2,346,4.8474576271186445
