She shows a class of preschoolers and how she works with them using various types of chairs and other accessories. She shows you some activities to develop sensory systems.",1508716800,,332,4.370967741935484
8217652,2,B000VA0RPC,"I thought the DVD was pricey for the amount of information given.  If you are already familiar with Sensory Processing, this DVD offers nothing new.  Even if you are brand new to Sensory Processiong, save the money and just read her book or any of the other books out there.  It will save you some $$$.",1194566400,5,302,4.357142857142857
