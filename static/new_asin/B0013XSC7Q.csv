8253168,1,B0013XSC7Q,"I found this thing almost impossible to watch and I believe this is one of the LEAST successful World War II documentaries I ever saw. Below are the reasons for which I consider ""Air war over Germany"" as a completely failed thing:

1) This thing is completely OUT OF FOCUS! It lasts 1h40mn, but the description of the air war over Germany between May 1940 and May 1945 (that is five years of intensive and dramatic fights!) takes maybe 15 minutes - no more! In fact for the first 35-40 minutes we are forced to watch mostly a very short and superficial reminder about the origins of World War II, the campaign of Poland, the campaign of France, the Battle of England, the campaigns in Africa and Balkans, the invasion of Soviet Union - gosh, even Pearl Harbor is involved!

2) Instead of telling the history of air war over Germany we are then treated to superficial biographies of different German and allied leaders and commanders, which finally add very little to this document. Some equally superficial and simplistic explanations are offered to describe the doctrines and technologies deployed by the adversaries - but all of that is presented in such a confused way, that it doesn't have any real value.

3) The very short and extremely superficial description of most important air battles and operations (like Operation ""Millennium"" or Operation ""Gomorrah"") is mostly without interest.

4) This document was made with an initial thesis all ready: allied massive bombing campaign against German cities was less efficient than expeted and it was continued mostly because ""bloodthirsty"" British and American generals, like Spaatz and Harris, ""refused to hear reason"". Everything that follows is just picking arguments to prove this thesis. Well, the only problem here is that THIS IS TOTAL BULL%**!!

The massive air attacks against Germany were ORDERED on the highest possible level of responsibility, by British War Cabinet (presided by Churchill) in 1942 for RAF and by Roosevelt in 1943 for US Air Force. If those orders were NEVER cancelled, it is because this strategy brought quickly concrete and positive results for allied war effort, which shortened this greatest war in human history and as result DIMINISHED the global human cost of the conflict. Those greatly positive results were as follows:

- from the moment the first massive air raid was launched (Operation ""Millenium"" 30-31 May 1942 against Cologne), an ENORMOUS amount of German military resources was necessary to protect the III Reich against allied air campaign. Already in January 1943 around 2200 heavy Flak guns (mostly the 88 mm but also some heavier 105 mm pieces) were deployed in Germany - when in the same time on the Eastern front every 88 mm Flak gun was considered worth its weight in gold, as they were the most efficient weapons against the swarms of Soviet T-34 and KV tanks. And with time the numbers of those guns were to GROW every month! Also, manning the guns, projectors, smoke screen generators, radars, communication centres, airfields, repair shops, munition dumps, etc. were tens of thousands of soldiers - in a time when Wehrmacht was in a situation of numerical inferiority on all fronts... Finally, if in summer 1943 Luftwaffe lost its control of the air space over Eastern front, it was not only because of growing Soviet air potential but also because it was necessary to keep HUNDREDS of fighters in Germany - and allied machine gunners defending the armadas of Halifaxes, Lancasters, Liberators and B-17s were slowly but surely grinding down the once mighty Luftwaffe fighter arm...

- the raids couldn't end the war by themselves, but they were causing REAL and SERIOUS damage to Nazi war effort. Destroyed industries had to be rebuild and most others had to be moved, either to disperse them or even to hide them deep underground. All this TOOK TIME and INTERRUPTED war production. Attacks against synthetic oil production plants caused even more grief to Wehrmacht and beginning in the spring of 1944 German armies became much less mobile and flexible than their allied counterparts, who had all the oil they needed. Oil problem (and also disruptions in production of vehicles) was so acute that until the end of war Wehrmacht had to rely in LARGE part on horses to tract supply wagons and even many artillery pieces(!), when already in 1942 horse traction disappeared totally from American and British armies and even Soviet Army relied towards the end of 1943 overwhelmingly on trucks and tractors (mostly American and British by the way), with horses fulfilling just an auxiliary role. The most extreme illustration of the success of this effort against synthetic oil production was that beginning in December 1944 the most advanced fighters in the world, German jets Me-262 Schwalbe, were tracted from hangars to the airstrips by OXEN(!) to save some drops of fuel, because it was in such a short supply...

- a frequently advanced argument for the ""lack of efficiency"" of allied bombings is the fact, that under the management of Albert Speer, the very efficient III Reich industry minister, in 1944 German industrial production actually INCREASED, which allowed for greater deliveries of tanks, planes and other weaponry for Wehrmacht than in any previous year - but what almost nobody ever asks, is how much more this production would increase WITHOUT a permanent, heavy and merciless pounding by allied bombers of all German industrial, transport and communication capacities...

- another target of relentless pounding were the rail yards and more generally ALL THE PLACES where many railways connected (including large railway stations in great cities). Those attacks terribly disrupted the transport of troops, weapons, fuel, food and materiel - as result, beginning in 1943, Wehrmacht fought more and more a ""poor man's war"". It is not an accident that in the second part of the war German soldiers rapaciously plundered every single supply depot or transport, no matter how small, they managed to seize in combat - because they were more and more short of correct food, cigarettes, warm clothes and even shoes!

- the targeting of this last target had also another result - it somehow disrupted, even if only a little, the carrying of Holocaust. Even if the allies never targeted German railways as a way to preserve European Jews from extermination, some (albeit sadly not so much) were nevertheless saved by the growing chaos in German transport system and managed to live until III Reich surrender - but people who are so willing to condemn allied leaders for everything and anything will never acknowledge that (or even give it a thought).

- finally, when describing (and criticising) the Dresden attack in February 1945, this document refuses to even pipe one word about the most crucial element - that this attack was requested in the STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS by Stalin himself, to help the progress of Red Army into Germany - and at that crucial moment of war, when Wehrmacht was still holding positions on Rhine and Oder Churchill and Roosevelt absolutely couldn't afford to alienate their redoubtable ally... Therefore charging Western leaders with ""war crimes"" in this case, is a textbook example of malicious prosecution...

- also, the bombing of Dresden is strongly condemned because ""in February 1945 Germany had no longer any capacity to fight back"". Well, the only problem with that argument is that EXACTLY at the same moment in war (15-18 February 1945) Wehrmacht launched operation ""Sonnenwende"", a strong counter-attack which forced Stalin to delay the final Berlin offensive by whole two months... Also let's have a look at Soviet Army casualties in battles which took place AFTER the bombing of Dresden: siege of Breslau - 30 000 dead, East Pomeranian offensive - 55 000 dead, East Prussian offensive - 126 000 dead, Vienna battle - 18 000 dead, Battle of Berlin - 100 000 dead, Prague offensive - 50 000 dead - in all, about 379 000 dead! Well, Jeeze Louise, I am really glad that Germany had no longer capacity to fight back, because otherwise I don't think there would be anybody left alive in whole Soviet Union (I am being ironic here...).

- bottom line, it is clear that allied bombings from May 1942 to May 1945 greatly hurt Hitler's war machine, shortened the war and saved hundreds of thousands of lives - and the ultimate sacrifice made by so many allied airmen was definitely NOT in vain....

5) Another, somehow less important problem with this document, is an incredibly sloppy and lazy use of real war footage - albeit it is mostly noticeable to the military freaks like me... Images and narration are in full contradiction at EVERY SINGLE MINUTE! The same image of German Stuka dive bombers attacking some targets most probably during early stages of operation ""Barbarossa"" appears every five minutes, including when narrator tells us about allied attacks of German cities...))) German Flak is mostly illustrated by light 20-mm ""vierling"" pieces - which shoot quite spectacularly, especially at night, but which were usually NOT used against allied heavy bombers, as those latter operated at heights BEYOND their range... Even more serious, at some moments when we are supposed to watch German heavy Flak, in fact we see... German field artillery!! Etc., etc.

CONCLUSION: this DVD has NO VALUE AT ALL and is an INSULT to the memory of all allied airmen who gave their lives fighting Nazism. Therefore, after viewing, I threw it in the GARBAGE! The only thing I kept was the box - after all it was innocent of any wrong doing and could be still useful one day... Stay AWAY from this thing!

If however you want to watch some BETTER documents about allied bombing campaign against Germany, here are some good DVD recommendations:

- The history of Bomber Command 1939-45
- The War file: The story of the Lancaster
- Bomber Harris - this is a movie, not a document, but absolutely BRILLIANT, with a grandiose performance by John Thaw!
- Night bombers (Archive of war) - a real treasure!
- War in the air (BBC, 3 DVD set)
- B-17 Flying Fortress (Legends of Air Combat)

There are of course also many good books - but if you are really interested you will have no trouble finding them by yourself. Here I just recommend two less obvious but pretty important titles: ""Defense of the Reich"" (Fortress) by Osprey and ""Night of the Intruders"" by Ian McLachlan - a very poignant book describing just one day (or rather night) of allied air effort against Nazi Germany...",1373414400,5,10527,4.961429381735678
8253169,1,B0013XSC7Q,"Badly researched and filled with factual inaccuracies. Confuses Luftwaffe tactics in engaging the Eighth Air Force by day with those used against the RAF by night. Often shows aircraft configured totally differently to the narration and sometimes the completely wrong aircraft. But perhaps the worst complaint I have against this b grade excuse for a documentary is the level of moral simplicity. Obviously dropping bombs on people is a horrible business and I'm not suggesting for a moment that we should ever celebrate it, but you have to look at the bombing campaign in the appropriate historical context. You have to understand what else was happening and what the options available were and also to look at the actions of both sides that contributed to this terrible outcome. Otherwise you end up with a nauseatingly naive piece of garbage that sounds like it was written by a teary eyed 15 year old as a school essay - perhaps it was, it sure sounds like it.

Send your ten bucks to World Vision instead, at least they'll use it to do some real moral good!",1285027200,4,1062,4.771739130434782
8253170,3,B0013XSC7Q,"This video is a decent overview of the topic of the RAF & USAAF offensive against Germany during WWII.

The video does not put enough emphasis on the prewar ideology of the strategic bombing cult and the influence of untried theories espoused by men such as Douhet postulating that bombing from the air could win wars without the need to engage in the kind of ground war of WWI that horrified so many in the West. Faith in strategic bombing, like any ideology, caused its adherents to continue the same policies despite overwhelming evidence they were counterproductive.

RAF Bomber Command simply decided to murder (there's no way to sugar-coat it) as many German civilians as possible in an attempt to destroy ""morale"" of the German people. They continued to do so long after their own intelligence had proven that the Germans were producing more weapons and munitions even as bombing became more severe.

The RAF deliberately chose target cities that were older, hence had more wood buildings, so the civilian death toll would be higher. Attacks continued even after Germany was clearly collapsing and no longer had any capacity to fight back. Dresden was a city that had absolutely no military value, yet was subject of several days of bombing that killed 135,000 civilians in the last few weeks of the war.

The USAAF's own ideology that self-defending, heavily-armed, heavy bombers could enter enemy airspace, deliver pinpoint bombing attacks and return with low losses was shattered by not one, but two disasterous raids on Schweinfurt. Then, they realized that the long-range escort fighters they disparaged as ""unnecessary"" during the interwar years were indeed necessary.

The video itself claims that strategic bombing was an important weapon in the defeat of Germany in WWII. Considering the 115,000 KIA's incurred (not including the POW's and WIA's invalided out) by Bomber Command, the 8th and 15th Air Forces, the massive amount of resources used to build and supply the massive fleets of heavy bombers, and the manpower (the cream of the crop of the pool) required to crew, maintain, and supply them, any intelligent observer must question this.

The video does a lot of things fairly well such as the tactics used by Bomber Command, the USAAF and the Luftwaffe, technology used in attack and defense, the weapons used by the opposing forces. It spends entirely too much time on bios of the commanders - including Churchill, Roosevelt and Hitler - that were simply irrelevant to the subject of the video.

Another reviewer has stated that this video is ""political"" and ""revisionist"". I would remind said reviewer that the most-bombed country in history is Vietnam. That bombing campaign contributed nothing to the successful accomplishment of the war aims of the U.S. in that conflict.",1239840000,14,2801,5.076086956521739
8253171,5,B0013XSC7Q,"I'm not really sure where the previous two negative reviews are coming from... This episode/DVD is exactly like the others in the series and it does a great job of telling the story of the air over Germany during World War II. Sure it provides some detail on the Battle of Britain, but it also gives some background on historical air combat tactics as they were first pioneered in World War I. I also completely disagree with the previous reviewer who stated that this episode gives an unfair or ""revisionist"" view of history ... Any book or DVD which is going to really tell this story, is going to have to mention how absolutely terrifying it was for the civilian population of Germany (the DVD is after all titled ""Air War over Germany"" not Air War Over Europe or Allied Air Missions of WWII ). So given the particular subject matter if they had only talked about the Allied actions and didn't mention the effect they had on the civilian population, they really wouldn't be telling the whole story. I now own about 6 DVD's from the Battlefield series and I have another 4 episodes recorded on my DVR from the Military channel. Therefore I strongly believe that if you enjoyed the other episodes in this series, you will absolutely enjoy this DVD as well.",1239753600,14,1257,4.591111111111111
8253172,1,B0013XSC7Q,"""Battlefield: Air War Over Germany"" offers the revisionist view that the Allied bombing campaign against German industry and cities was ineffective and immoral.  Current historiography on the bombing campaign is ignored.  No comparison is made to German attacks on Warsaw, Rotterdam, London, Coventry, Stalingrad, or German devastation of USSR cities and population; or any mention of Japanese devastation of China.

Not recommended.",1224633600,4,433,5.951612903225806
8253173,1,B0013XSC7Q,"""Airwar Over Germany"" begins with a disproportionate emphasis on the Battle of Britain.  I had hoped that this doc would provide a chronology of Allied strategic raids over Germany with requisite film footage.  I was disappointed in this.  I had also hoped for some detailed analysis of particular raids with the German defensive response but also found the doc to be mostly lacking in this regard.  I often found the same film footage being used more than once or footage that was not illustrative of the topic being addressed.  In comparing this doc with the original ""BATTLEFIELD"" series I found it truly inferior.",1222387200,14,617,4.951456310679611
