7071764,5,B00UXVBYO2,Great movie with a unique story line. Not your typical faith-based movie. Very enjoyable and extremely family friendly. Acting was definitely good. Give it a watch. You'll like it too :),1485820800,,186,5.032258064516129
7071765,5,B00UXVBYO2,"Very interesting and entertaining. Not just a God movie but the name of Jesus is mentioned. This is a Christian movie not just a feel-good, family movie. However, there is not a clear message about the gospel. The movie never tells what Jesus did for us and that he paid the price for our sin and that in order to be saved that you need to repent and make Jesus the Lord of your life. Yet some of this is indirectly demonstrated. WATCH THE MOVIE!",1485475200,,446,4.258823529411765

7071769,5,B00UXVBYO2,"My wife and I purchased 77 CHANCES about a week ago just on a whim. We could not find many reviews on the movie outside of right here on Amazon. I am a Christian movie buff and very selective of the movies I buy, so I was taking a bit of a chance.

I have to say that all in all, 77 CHANCES is one of the best acted, best scripted faith-based movies now in my collection. Great music score as well! Great scriptural message about life, love, forgiveness, and letting go. I was in tears by the last 10-15 minutes of the movie.
HIGHLY recommended!

Hats off to Mr. Tracy Trost and the entire crew behind this one. AWESOME job everyone!
You guys did not get the accolades you deserve for this movie.",1471478400,4,696,4.186567164179104

8708634,5,B00UXVBYO2,This is a beautiful story of second chances and letting go of the past in order to move forward into the future.,1524182400,2,112,4.136363636363637
8708635,5,B00UXVBYO2,Great movie! I enjoyed it! It causes one to think about who and what's important in life. We as humans have a tendency to try to keep events from happening. We need to put our trust in God so he can direct us.,1522454400,2,209,3.883720930232558
8708636,5,B00UXVBYO2,Took me several viewings to catch on. Fascinating presentation of Christian teaching about relationships and personal growth. Lots of humor in midst of challenges. Spoke to me personally.,1522022400,2,187,5.714285714285714
8708637,4,B00UXVBYO2,"Well acted, poignant story. The theme is a direct retelling of Ground Hog Day, to which the characters give  and during the course of the film. However, I think  that story bears repeating. It alllows for some great character development. The actors are strong enough to carry it off. Very good soundtrack, one of the best movies from a Christian company that I've seen recently.",1521331200,,379,4.815384615384615

8708640,3,B00UXVBYO2,"Slow starting. I almost called it a waste of money and quit watching it, but I stuck it out. I'll glad I did. It turned out to be a decent movie. Not the best, but still worth watching.",1518134400,,185,3.8947368421052633
8708641,5,B00UXVBYO2,"This is one of the best acted,  best storyline Christian movies I've seen.  The message is strong,  it has a few twists & turns, a little action and some tear jerkers toward the end,  but it keeps you involved & presents well.  It has a good scriptural based GODly message & it's family friendly.",1514592000,,296,4.407407407407407
