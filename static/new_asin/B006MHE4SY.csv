8500744,5,B006MHE4SY,Will get strong hips with this DVD! Which is why I got it. Just wish she had done a stretch only part. My right hip is always  Very Tight. Glad I got it though. Didn't like the cardboard cover for it though. Its just slide the DVD in with no closure.:(,1428451200,,252,3.9411764705882355
8500745,4,B006MHE4SY,"This DVD hits all of the muscles that need to be strengthened for running. I will incorporate it into my workout at least once or twice a week. I agree it's a little dry, but the exercises are worth dealing with that.",1428364800,,217,4.190476190476191
8500746,5,B006MHE4SY,"Not a runner, but LOVE this.  I learned the exercises and do them at my own speed without the dvd now.  I think these exercises, to the best of one's ability, would help just about anyone.  If you are preparing for or rehabbing from hip / knee surgery, these would be especially helpful.",1402012800,,287,4.377358490566038
8500747,4,B006MHE4SY,"I ended up getting this DVD since I had read great things about it on the Video Fitness forums.  I'm not a runner, but I suffer from knee tendonitis that my orthopedist told me was due to tight hip flexors.  Doing the kind of floorwork and exercises on this DVD really helps women strengthen those weak hip muscles that can lead to knee weaknesses and imbalances.

The DVD comes in a paper sleeve, and is packed with a great variety of material (over two hours' worth).  To do the program, you'll need a mat and some light hand weights.

Here are the programs:

--Dynamic Warm-up: 2.5 minutes (cardio)

--Program 1: 46 minutes, including:
Glutes/Hamstrings 1
Hips 1
Hip Flexors/Quads 1
Core Back 1
Core Planks 1
Back 1

--Program 2: 50 minutes, including:
Glutes/Hamstrings 2
Hips 2
Hip Flexors/Quads 2
Core Back 2
Core Plank 2
Back 2

--Strength Training: 58 minutes
  Warm-up: 5 minutes (stretch & tone)
  Running Muscles: Weights/No Weights: 32 minutes (toning with a couple cardio bursts)
  Non Running Muscles: Weights/No Weights: 26 minutes (toning)

The instructor gives nice cues and form pointers, and the programs integrate pilates moves with exercises like planks and leg lifts.

The only problem is that the video is a little bit low-key/boring for me.  I wish that the music was better/livelier and that the instructor had a bit more energy.  She seems very sweet and is definitely knowledgable, but this DVD doesn't have as much ""fun factor"" for me as some other workouts, so I tend to reach for other DVDs over it.

Overall, though, it's a solid program that really can help strengthen weak hip and core muscles, for both runners and non-runners alike.",1391212800,5,1667,4.802816901408451
8500748,5,B006MHE4SY,"I love that weights aren't required.  You can get a great workout with just a mat (or directly on the floor I suppose).  This is great to take when traveling.

I find it very similar to pilates.  However, there are so many exercises and they are so demanding I think you can make it more intense than any class I've been to.",1360454400,3,324,4.17741935483871
8500749,4,B006MHE4SY,I purchased this after a hamstring tendinitis sidelined me from running. Physical therapy was prescribed but I wanted to look into cross training for preventing future injuries. Lisa is pleasant and the exercises are similar to my physical therapy but challenging! Highly recommended despite drawbacks ( some exercises have poor form at the end of some sets),1358035200,5,358,5.298245614035087
8500750,4,B006MHE4SY,"I usually don't nit pick about an instructor as long as they seem to have passion for what they are doing. She seems like she does, the workouts are great, but I just felt myself glancing at the clock to see what the workout was over. Effectiveness it is great since it does hit all those running muscles, but I felt it was to dry. I am only keeping it because it is effective to working those running muscles.",1331510400,7,410,4.2025316455696204
8500751,5,B006MHE4SY,"I am not a runner, though I do occasionally walk/jog at the Y.  I do most of my strength workouts at home, however, using exercise dvds.  I love this dvd and consider it my best buy of 2011 (and I bought quite a few last year).  You get a ton of content and I love the short, body-part focused toning segments.  I add them on at the end of cardio workouts, other strength workouts, or when I just don't feel like doing a ""real"" workout.  I love the short and sweet plank segments (great when you don't want to do crunches) as well as the Glutes 2 and HIps 2 segments.  What a great burn!",1329350400,8,587,4.060869565217391
8500752,5,B006MHE4SY,"I have been running for about a year and felt that I needed cross training to improve my running strength.  I have been doing this video and already feel a difference in my running performance and overall strength.  I love how it has two complete programs working all the muscle groups and extra add ons. The instructor, Lisa Watson, is very pleasant and easy to follow.  It is a real value for your money.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1327622400,6,436,4.481012658227848
