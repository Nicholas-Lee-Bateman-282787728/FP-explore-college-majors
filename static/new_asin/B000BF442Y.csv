8085980,5,B000BF442Y,Cult classic. I love all the Jean Cocteau movies. The symbolism and imagery are profound and strike personal notes in anyone who watches his movies. It is difficult to review his movies because no two people feel the impact of the films in the same way and the impression they leave on the psyche. Every time I watch his movies I see something different or I feel something different from what I experienced before; nuances that were not seen or noted before. There is a lot of 'archetype' reference in his movies. Deep stuff.,1403654400,,526,4.6063829787234045
8085981,5,B000BF442Y,"The lavish style of Cocteau is carved in relief with his first feature, imbued into the great surrealistic mainstream. 1930 marks not only the auspicious debut of this renowned poet, but it will be reminded as the most imaginative decade of the Century in which surrealistic proposals concerns: Bunuel would dazzle the entire world with ""An Andalusia dog"", ""The gold's age"" or ""The Hurdes"" and Einsenstein was in the eve of Viva Mexico and Dizga Vertov with his eye-camera proposed his experiences.

And being the first Op of a genius, there will be food for thought respect the forthcoming projects specially Orpheus and Orpheus' testament

8085982,4,B000BF442Y,"In film, Jean Cocteau found the perfect medium to portray his own personal mythology... Though his involvement in cinema was uneven, spasmodic and largely undertaken during later life, his fantastic images, well-meaning amateurism and continuous self-preoccupation were inspirational to the avant-garde and underground...

By 1930, when Cocteau made his first film, he was already an established poet, novelist, dramatist and artist... ""Le Sang d'un pote"" (The Blood of a Poet) was a characteristically romantic portrait of the artist structured as a surreal succession of images centered on a private mythology: desiring immortality, the poet, martyr to creativity, must first pass through a mirror into a deathly private dream-world... Financed, like ""L'Age d'Or,"" by the Vicomte de Noailles, its indulgent celebration of artists in general (and, therefore, Cocteau in particular) makes it inferior to Buuel's film, but its strong, bizarre symbolism is often alarming...",1168560000,,972,5.7972027972027975

Blood of a Poet is surprisingly captivating and encourages the viewer to remain completely attentive by capturing surprise in every moment. Who would think a ball of snow would destroy a human life or that a mouth could transfer from a painting onto a hand like a sensual stigmata.

As a man struggles to comprehend his newly found ""life-giving"" force, he kisses a statue into life and then becomes a voyeur in a world of bizarre occurrences after splashing through a mirror, a scene that made me laugh with surprise. Here, decorative angels climb down off walls, walk across ceilings and housekeepers sigh in frustration.

The violent scenes are more like scenes from a dream and in black-and-white, the effect is rather mild and the suicide seems to be unsuccessful. The idea is more about the artistic look of the black blood than the actual death of the individuals. It is very experimental in nature and more art than death.

Recently while watching a set of music videos directed by Anton Corbijn, I did notice a direct correlation between this movie and a 1984 music video where a hand (complete with faces instead of just lips) follows a woman and people try to step through mirrors. It could have just as easily been inspired by Alice in Wonderland, but I have my sneaking suspicion ""Blood of a Poet"" has inspired more than a few music videos.

The beginning of this movie seems to stay in your mind for a few days as you consider the meanings and symbolism. Due to the realistic portrayals (sets are all fairly uncomplicated), this is surreal, but in a very down-to-earth way.
