Many people have deplored L&H's films for Fox, and they are a bit disappointing, after their wonderful work at Hal Roach Studios - but Stan & Ollie always have their moments and add a little something to the weakest material. GREAT GUNS, JITTERBUGS, and their last studio feature, THE BULLFIGHTERS are the best of the lot, with the weakest, in my opinion, being THE DANCING MASTERS, which seems to be hardly more than a collection of retreaded material from their classic shorts. The rest have something to offer, though, though none of them is a patch on their classic work. Still worth the price!",1517184000,,690,4.80672268907563
