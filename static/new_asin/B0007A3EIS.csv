2207907,5,B0007A3EIS,"A blending of genres, this bittersweet film from Norway is a buddy film and a romantic comedy rolled into one. Two billboard hangers move in with an agoraphobic third man, and life for the three 20-somethings proceeds with no more than the usual rough spots in the road of prolonged adolescence. A budding romance goes sour when the exchange of apartment keys is not equally appreciated by both parties, and another of the three discovers that he has a six-year-old son. Changes are set in motion, however, when their lives become the subject of a reality TV show. Entertaining and enjoyable film about friendship, romantic relationships, and discovering the heart's true desires.",1239926400,2,680,5.080357142857143
2207908,5,B0007A3EIS,"I loved this movie! The actors are all well chosen and talented, and the film is just charming. The storyline is a little predictable, but it's not done in the typical Hollywood way, so you don't feel like you've already seen it a million times with different actors. It is sweet, fresh and honest. A very enjoyable experience.

I watched it on netflix downloadable movies and then ordered it on here!",1220659200,2,401,4.647887323943662
2207909,4,B0007A3EIS,"Kristoffer and Geir are as close as two friends can be. They live together, work together and get in trouble together and Kristoffer catches every highlight and many lowlights on his camcorder, which he never leaves behind. By accident he loses a few tapes from his bag and they end up in the hands of a local television station that decides to give them their own show. The premise is that they live their lives as usual and film things that happen as usual and the network would air some of the footage. It was all simple enough. And their lives were simple enough...at first. Fame, new women, old women and a paranoid roommate teach these two young men that maybe it is time to grow up a little.

This was a fun, but frustrating, Norse film about young people and their inter-personal relationships. I have seen my fair share of foreign films, but I have to guess this is my first from that part of the world. I would have never found it but for the power of recommendation. Buddy was suggested first as a ""you might like this if you liked The Rage in Placid Lake."" I did like The Rage in Placid Lake...and I did like Buddy.",1173225600,3,1127,4.366666666666666
2207910,5,B0007A3EIS,"True love's course never did run smooth, particularly for the nutty Norwegians in this hilarious comedy.  In his first directorial debut, Morten Tyldum does an excellent job keeping the pace popping.  The hand-held camera angles of a reality-based television give way to the steady camera shots of three roommates who are bumbling their way through life & love.  Nicolai Cleve Broch who also worked with Aksel Hennie (Geir) in his movie ""Uno,"" is our romantic protagonist.  With his full-bodied lips giving him G.Q. good looks, he's an ideal romantic lead whose quizzical smiles are not too heavy, but just deep enough to keep our interest.  Broch plays Pals Kristoffer who breaks up with his girlfriend Elizabeth, played by Janne Formoe in her first film.  Geir is the balding blonde roommate whose daredevil stunts like jumping from a third-story window mask some regret as the father of a child from his teenage years.  Anders Baasmo Christiansen plays the heavyset Stig Inge who is a web designer whose agoraphobia keeps him near home.  Kristoffer has a camera and tapes their crazy bachelor lifestyle.  During an escape after a prank, some of Kristoffer's tapes fall from his bag and wind up in the hands of a local TV station that wants to base a reality-TV segment on the air.  With nothing to lose, all agree and start becoming television personalities.  Pals & Geir's day job consists of pasting billboards; and the irony hits as Kristoffer pastes a poster of himself for reality TV.  A new roommate, Henriette, enters the picture.  She is played by the sultry Pia Tjelta who has appeared in Norwegian films ""Mongoland"" & ""An Enemy of the State (English title).""  The consequences of becoming celebrities eventually weighs down on them as Stig must confront whether they're making fun of his mental quirk; and Geir accidentally has broadcast the fact that he has a son.  This lighthearted romantic picture ends complete with the right set of lovers jumping into the water from a pier and a boat and swimming together in a final embrace.  While not too heavy, this bubbly movie is an entertaining gem.  It won the Audience Award at the 2003 Karlovy Vary Film Festival in Carlsbad, Czech Republic, which is becoming an important film festival for central and Eastern Europe.  Film Movement's DVD offers a wacky short and is well done.  Bravo!",1156809600,8,2349,4.916243654822335
2207911,4,B0007A3EIS,"--And this movie proves it, it's all over the world!

Kristoffer makes his living putting up billboards with his friend, Geir and spends the rest of his time hanging out with his girlfriend, Elisabeth. He also films his friends doing silly or crazy things. When Elisabeth feels brave enough to give Kristoffer her spare keys, he fearfully breaks up with her saying that things are going too fast. No matter, she has found another---quick.

So, K hangs out with Geir and his new landlord Stig Inge, who has a very real phobia of not wanting to leave the city. He gets an anxiety attack every time he enters the Metro station and remembers that he ""forgot to turn off the stove.."" etc.

Henriette comes on the scene and moves in with the boys for a few weeks and soothes Kristoffers broken heart, even though she has a boyfriend that she will go on a long sailing trip with in a matter of days. Tangled webs? Especially when Elisabeth comes back!

Even though the premise of the film is that Kristoffers tapes wind up on TV and he becomes a celebrity, you may notice that the review doesn't talk much about that. Probably because we don't see much of it. There is some, but the main plot of this movie has to do with his love life/what happens when he exposes his friends dirty little secrets. I would have liked to see more of the ""Jackass"" type antics, but it was a good movie all the same.",1111276800,6,1390,4.41796875

8046519,4,B0007A3EIS,"Only in a Scandinavian movie could a romcom express the humor that Buddy does. The first half of the film was particularly successful. Later on, things got a bit too complicated and humor took a back seat to more pressing concerns. Mercifully, by the end of the movie the chosen course avoided the big waves and we were back to smooth sailing. (Well, actually not. More like in deep water. But that was all to the good, as you'll see.)
Don't miss Buddy. It's really worth seeing.",1476489600,,479,4.517241379310345

8046524,5,B0007A3EIS,"Nicolai Cleve Broch is perfect as the lead in this film. The handsome Norwegian actor gets to portray a very winsome character who might as well be singing ""I'm just a soul whose intentions are good, oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"" throughout much of the film. Although the film is funny, it also has beautifully poignant moments. It's one of those ""has everything"" films. Broch's character is charming but makes mistakes, as we all do, and some of his mistakes hurt the ones he loves most. The direction is great, the acting superb, and the script outstanding.",1381622400,,576,4.77
8046525,4,B0007A3EIS,"In Buddy, a trio of friends find themselves selected to produce a reality television show about their antics.  It becomes popular, and this popularity tugs at the roots of their friendship.  Trust erodes, and relationships become tattered.  Is success defined as money and popularity, or something else?

8046526,1,B0007A3EIS,"the movie itself is great, I purchased it after watching it on netflix. Unfortunately, the dvd didn't work at all. I tried it on 3 players. I contacted the company and they didn't have a replacement. Fortunately, a Norwegian friend of mine enjoys re-enacting scenes from the movie at dinner parties. Less fortunately, I don't speak Norwegian.",1304121600,,342,5.017543859649122
8046527,4,B0007A3EIS,"Amazon recommended this Norwegian movie to me after my viewing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elling/dp/B00006L92B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elling</a>.  'Elling' was superb in every way - a constant delight.  While 'Buddy' is also good, it's not the transcendent experience of 'Elling.'  Both films, however, are emblematic of the quality product produced by this small country.  Its population of slightly less than five million puts it No. 116 in world rank.  But that's hardly their standing in the league tables of cinematic quality.  While no Denmark or Israel (my personal winners of the Quality:Size Index), Norway's culture clearly demands and produces quality product.

'Buddy' centers on Kristoffer, Geir and Stig Inge, three under-employed 20-ish guys living together in downtown Oslo.  Kristoffer and Geir specialize in 'Jackass'-like stunts, which Kristoffer secretly films and adroitly narrates for their own viewing.  While attempting a stunt at what turns out to be at television business offices, Kristoffer loses a couple of these tapes as he scrambles to pull off the feat.  Rather than press charges, a keen executive recognizes the attractiveness of Kristoffer's product.  In short order, a show is born, one in which Kristoffer catalogs the daily life of the three roommates.  Nicolai Cleve Broch's likability as Kristoffer is what carries the film.

What starts as a lark eventually has real implications: while Kristoffer and Geir have the right attitude for this type of thing, it's clear Stig Inge has some definite issues - an agoraphobia that becomes more acute as the show continues to up the ante. Kristoffer and Stig Inge try to address these issues in an interview, but it doesn't go as planned.

The other story is of Kristoffer's relationships.  He starts with girlfriend, Elisabeth (Janne Formoe), but when she looks to take the next step (sharing keys), he's clearly not ready.  Things tumble from there.  Meanwhile, the trio's search for a fourth roommate brings Henriette to the door.  She's played by Pia Tjelta, vivacious and effortlessly gorgeous here.  You take one look at her and can guess where this story is headed.",1303516800,,2210,5.5044510385756675
