3913704,2,B002DY9K48,"Well done film, if your agenda is to show an unbalanced view of ?Christians.  Yes, show all the crazies in order to make your ""point""  And what is the point of this film?  That Christianity is false and the atheist view is correct.  Waste of time.  Little new to be learned here........",1419897600,5,286,4.423076923076923
3913705,1,B002DY9K48,"For a film about Jesus in America it shows no black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, etc. churches at all. I don't understand how you can make a film about Christianity in America and completely bypass the historic ethnic churches, let alone that the film doesn't touch Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox Churches at all. There is more to American Christianity than white suburban Evangelical churches. No one person of color (with the potential exception of Phil Aguilar) is interviewed for this documentary at all (Miles McPherson wasn't interviewed but filmed) and only one woman, Harmony Dust, in a leadership church/ministry role is interviewed (Note: Kerri Pomarolli is a comedian and not in a position of leadership per se like the bulk of the other people interviewed). One wonders if the only reason they even put Harmony Dust in the documentary is because her ministry is to strippers instead of a local congregation. This makes no sense as the amount of nonwhites and females in ministry leadership is ever growing.

Second, the latter part of the film is highly theologically biased towards those that are moving in a neo-liberal theological position. While the film shows a wide array of people and positions, it was only those that doubted Scripture, hell, and the traditional church that were given time to expound their position. There was no counter balance to Frank Schaeffer, Jason Boyett, or David Dark.

Another matter is that Frank Schaeffer forgot to mention that he was the one that pushed his father into the political arena and not the other way around. His father was not too concerned about abortion and neither was Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell. Frank Schaeffer was the catalyst for the Evangelical pro-life movement and bringing in conservative Protestants into what was considered a ""Catholic issue.""

Bush and the Rise of the Religious Right in America</a>&nbsp;His explanation of premillennialism is horribly distorted.

Why Frank Schaeffer dominated the film is something I don't understand. Most interviewees were given 1-2 segments while he got three to speak his mind and his unique theology. Another matter that bothers me, as an academic, is the fact that no scholars or theologians were interviewed. Instead, journalists and outside spectators were interviewed where people like D.A. Carson, Walter Bruggeman, James Cone, Marva Dawn, Mark Noll, etc. should have been given time to speak from an academic and insider position. All the ""experts"" that said the Left Behind book caused the massive shift toward premillennialism have not done their research. Premillennialism has been in the majority for several decades in America, long before Left Behind was even conceived. The Left Behind books were just a fictional series that was written out of a milieu that had already been there, hence their popularity. People devoured the books because they already believed in the theology.

Bottom line: While the film does shed light on some of the odder corners of American Christianity, it leaves far too much out to give an accurate picture and gives too many distortions.",1410652800,23,4533,6.9057591623036645

3913707,5,B002DY9K48,wonderful movie that really makes you think about how we view Christ and religion.,1406851200,,82,4.928571428571429

3913709,5,B002DY9K48,"I think the summary for this movie doesn't do it justice. It's about much more than different forms of Christianity, as it explores the impact the religion has had on American politics and the impact cultural changes have had on the way Christianity is presented and practiced. Like any good documentary, it makes you think, both about religion's place in US society and your own beliefs. I would definitely recommend seeing this documentary.",1402963200,2,442,5.068493150684931
3913710,1,B002DY9K48,"I was very excited to watch this but now i wish i hadn't. It was very good and shared amazing testimonies but only up to about half way..after that it went waaaay down hill. Showed some very disturbing things and not sure if they are trying to bash evangelicals or what...if i had watched this before knowing Jesus then it would definitely be more fuel to keep me from wanting to be a christian! There were no miracles, no signs and wonders...and it ended making me and my dad feel icky! We are seriously having to talk and read and watch other things to edify us and make us feel better. I do love and appreciate many of the ministries shown but i feel kind of bad for them to be associated with this film :/",1401926400,2,709,4.220588235294118
3913711,5,B002DY9K48,"This movie is a rarity. Regardless of if the viewer is a believer or not, it simply shows many of the different ways people  express and practice their faith. It's real, it's respectful. In this world where people get all snarky about ""Christians"" it's nice to see an honest portrayal of the sincere and diverse Christian community.",1400716800,5,332,4.824561403508772
3913712,5,B002DY9K48,"Christianity in American culture is quite different than in other parts of the world, and American Jesus sets out to show this variance. Not at all through negativity, the film presents how the different sub-cultures of ""America"" celebrate faith and it explores Christianity in every faction of American life. From the bread line to the yoga studio; from the humble churches of snake handlers to the mega churches that line the suburbs, American Jesus looks into how America, while searching for meaning as a nation both celebrates and commercializes faith. Through what the filmmakers call a mosaic, the end result is well produced and very enlightening.",1395014400,,655,5.188679245283019

However, this documentary focuses on some of the denominations and off-shoots of denominations that have sprung up in the United States. Each is as relevant as those inherited and imported from Europe, only less known. A great film.",1428278400,,459,5.666666666666667

3913717,3,B002DY9K48,"The variety of people from all walks of life talking about their faith was most interesting.  The odd thing was the strange juxtaposition of switching from such a varied scope of people with sincere faith to Frank Schaeffer talking for about thirty minutes on his rejection of traditional Christianity and extreme criticism of evangelical Christians, with no transition or explanation for the sudden shift in outlook.",1425081600,2,417,5.318181818181818

3913721,2,B002DY9K48,"Engaging doc that unfortunately lacks scope, cohesion, or clear direction. The first half is mostly a whirlwind tour of oddities run by counter-culture white men, and the second half gets bogged down in biographies and opinions of people who have no bearing on the rest of the film.

Although the churches showcased are certainly varied, there's almost no diversity in race represented. There are also NO female Christian leaders featured, except for one woman who was given two minutes to explain her ministry to sex workers. Where are the female pastors and theologians? Why, in a film that features churches geared toward cowboys, surfers, bikers, and snake charmers, are women and people of color intentionally left out? Even as a tour of evangelical outliers, this lack of representation is glaring.",1422403200,5,804,5.184615384615385
3913722,2,B002DY9K48,This film is a shallow caricature of American Christianity. American Christians are all semi-literate rubes who are intolerant and ignorant of everything except what they read in the Bible which is nothing more than a collection of myths and rules meant to spoil everybody's fun. This film is worth watching only if you want to have some insight as to how the cultural left views Christians and their faith.,1421539200,,407,4.913043478260869
8366238,1,B002DY9K48,"Awful- Taking the most silly fringe elements of Christianity and painting them as the norm. Accuses the religious right of racism without any evidence. There's more that can be said, but the point is, this clearly has an agenda behind it.",1523491200,,238,4.829268292682927
8366239,1,B002DY9K48,"This movie has some great footage and interviews with many people sharing their faith in a wide variety of settings. It also raises several issues of doubt that many Christians honestly face from time to time. In addition, it asks several relevant questions about the interplay between ones faith and american culture. These are all honest and real issues that have an objective place for discussion.

Where the film really takes a turn for the worse is at the end. Its almost like it just falls off a cliff. There is an extremely one sided anti Bible based view that is put forth. This view attempts to come across as if its drawing a ""wise"" conclusion from many peoples honest expressions of faith. It almost like some sort of one sided political puppet attempts to take over at the very end. This last view makes it clear that it is very against strongly grounded views based on the Bible. The movie would be better received if the views expressed at the end would have occurred earlier in the movie and not as some sort of ""wise"" conclusion. While I have not met or talked to those being interviewed I can only imagine many of them would not want to take part in the movie and probably would feel like they had been scammed after watching the film. It may have left them feeling deceived, like someone was trying to use them in some sort of ""straw man"" argument against those who have reverence for the Bible.",1513987200,,1413,4.51953125
8366240,2,B002DY9K48,"This documentary had some interesting interviews and gives a inside look at many different facets of Christianity in America but it was very jumbled and hard to follow overall and really seemed to focus on the extreme ends of the spectrum while leaving out more mainline Christianity all together.  It does very little to show much of the good that the Christian ""church"" is doing in America and abruptly ends with a depressing and very judgemental conclusion.  I would not waste your time with this!",1507680000,,500,4.870588235294117

8366242,2,B002DY9K48,"I watched this with an open mind, and believe that it's important to watch controversial documentaries at times so that you can challenge yourself, and practice discerning between what is right and wrong, truth and lie.  With that said, what motivated me to write this review, is a part in this documentary where this guy alludes to the fact that christians are brainwashed to follow God because of the threat of going to hell if we don't love Him. Wow. I will just say this. I am a christian. I love Jesus. And it's not because of fear, or because of terror, or because I am brainwashed. It is because I love Him, He has done great things in my life, He has proven to be loving, caring, faithful and my best friend. He has healed me of countless physical ailments, and has done great miracles in my life. Therefore - that part of this documentary, in my opinion - is completely false, and could only been contrived by someone who does not know the love of God.",1496016000,,961,4.398876404494382

8366246,1,B002DY9K48,"Was an attack on churches in america from a secular standpoint. Their darling seemed to be frankie schaeffer and his turning away from God because his faith did not match his fathers faith but now does because he is part of the secular left wing. In other words, the view of the movie is interviews of ""weird churches and their pastors"" without finding genuine and authentic people who want to live a praiseworthy life to God. Sad, but nothing you shouldn't expect from hollywood. Like going to the zoo.",1440892800,3,503,4.662921348314606

I once believed like this and not look back and laugh. A very entertaining documentary.,1433030400,2,252,4.270833333333333
