2354404,5,B000A2XCBC,"One of the most despicable things that has to do with this film is that there aren't more glowing reviews of it here at Amazon.com. Why is that? Come on people! There must've been a wide viewing audience of it since its win at the Academy Awards!

We (i.e., The U.S.) don't often see the grittiest side of life. And when I say gritty, I MEAN gritty. The audience takes an emotional roller coaster ride with narrator and director Zana Brisky as she visits the red light district in Calcutta. Here she meets up with eight children who are the off-spring of prostitutes who ""work the line"", trying to make enough money to buy their next meal. The children seem doomed to a life of extreme poverty and, most likely for the girls, to also ""work the line"" when they reach the ripe old age of 14 or 15.

But Mrs. Brisky decides to teach the children how to shoot photographs of their surroundings (she gives each of them a simple point and shoot camera) and engages them in weekly classroom-like visits, showing them the photos they shot the previous days and telling them what they did right and wrong. The children are immediately smitten by the idea of becoming photographers, and they seem to be lifted out of their horrible surroundings, dreaming of becoming world-famous photo-journalists.

Throughout the film we see mostly the children, which I found to be extremely refreshing as far as documentaries go. Most documentaries (I feel) put too much emphasis on the documentary maker(s) and show shot after shot of them rather than the subjects their supposed to be telling the audience about. But not here. Only a fraction of the footage is dedicated to images of Mrs. Brisky, and those portions were vital to the film. Mrs. Brisky tries to get the children out of their hovel as often as she can, and when she does -- for instance when she takes them for their first trip ever to the sea shore -- you can see the children light up (they dance and sing). But when they return to the red light district, their tone quickly sombers. The viewer sees (and feels) this time and again.

The amazing thing, too, is that the children become very able photographers, even having one of their photos appear on the cover of the Amnesty International calendar for 2005.

I should warn you, though, that the documentary doesn't sugar-coat anything (including some horrendous language, child abuse, death, murder, and the risk of HIV). But after watching this incredibly engaging film, I can easily see why it won Best Documentary during the Oscars.",1125619200,96,2534,4.698198198198198
2354405,4,B000A2XCBC,One of the more harsh documentaries I've seen this year. Also one of the best. A must see.,1124323200,,90,4.055555555555555
2354406,4,B000A2XCBC,"Born Into Brothels is a wonderful film in many ways. The children reveal themselves as complex humans, full of hopes and aspirations, tempered by a very mature understanding of the realities they face. It was an absolutely inspired idea to let them document their own lives through photography, and many of the images they produced are breathtaking. It makes sense that this project has received so much attention in the art world, and in the film award circle. Time and again I was touched by the childrens' stories and grateful to have been allowed into their lives. It's not hard to see our own children in their faces and smiles, but it's also a difficult and important experience to do so.

I do think that Zana Briski shows a certain naivete despite her firsthand awareness of the difficulties of these childrens' lives. She seems to believe - indeed, she MUST believe - that she has the power to help them. By the end we see that this is very, very difficult to do, and see that even family members of the children respond to her efforts with scepticism, fear and maybe even a bit of jealously. Briski is, after all, telling poor, poor prostitutes that she can help make their children into doctors and lawyers. How scary would that be - for a parent to face so completely loosing their child to a different (even if it's better) world? In a way this film is as much about a well-intentioned white Western person facing the realities of a third world, post-colonial nation as it is about the children of the title.

Either way, however, it's more than worth your time.",1123027200,4,1575,4.621428571428571
2354407,5,B000A2XCBC,"In order to photograph in the red light districts of Calcutta, India, photojournalist Zana Briski lived there for several years. Though many of the residents were wary of her camera, Briski found that the neighborhood children were unafraid and curious. So she began teaching them photography, giving each child a point-and-shoot film camera with which to photograph his or her environment and providing classes on technique and editing. This eventually resulted in international acclaim for the children's photographs and media coverage for Briski's unusual photo classes. ""Born Into Brothels"" is a documentary of Briski's class of young photographers filmed by Zana Briski and Ross Kaufman about 2 years into the project that has become known as ""Kids with Cameras"".

The best thing about ""Born Into Brothels"" is that it allows the children to tell their story in their own words. Zana Briski's class of 8 photographers -who call her ""Zana Auntie""- are children of prostitutes, born and raised among the harsh realities of Calcutta's Sonagachi red light district. There are 5 girls: Kochi, Tapasi, Shanti, Puja, and Suchitra, and 3 boys: Manik, Gour, and Avijit, ranging in age from 10 to 14 years, but mostly pre-teens. The documentary is dominated by interviews with the children and by their photographs, with occasional voiceover or footage of Zana Briski. The filmmakers are commendably respectful of the children and their decisions. These kids understand their situations very well and tend to be philosophical about it, yet many of them yearn for opportunities to escape life in the brothel. Interestingly, the kids are not fatherless children of single prostitutes, as I might have expected. Many of their mothers' are married and live with large extended families.

""Born Into Brothels"" lets the kids talk about themselves, their families, and their world. We sit in on their photo classes, accompany them on photo field trips to the zoo and the beach, and sympathize with Zana Briski's frustration as she struggles with bureaucracy and prejudice to find boarding schools that will accept children of sex workers. We also see the kids beaming with pride and having some fun as they enjoy international success and a bit of fame in India as well. Zana Briski has obviously done a great deal of work and invested a lot of emotional energy in a project that may change the lives of a handful of children if she is lucky. But even if the kids lives' turn out no different than their parents', photography has broadened their outlook and given them some great experiences. ""Born Into Brothels"" is an engaging documentary of that process. To learn more or purchase prints, visit [...] .

The DVD (Thinkfilm 2005): There are text bios of Zana Briski and Ross Kaufman. ""About the Photographers"" includes text bios of the children, which are useful in figuring out who is who.",1121990400,36,2879,5.069620253164557
2354408,3,B000A2XCBC,"At the heart of this movie is a great act of humanity that touched even me, and for that I will recommend this film. That does not mean however that this is a great film, or that it deserved the Oscar for best documentary that it won. Zana Briski takes troubled kids from Calcutta's Red Light District and tries to give them hope. She shows them the power of photography, takes them to the zoo, and fights for schools to accept them. These kids are obviously touched and moved, although things don't always work out as she planned.  She uses a technique similar to that used in ""Voices of Iraq"" in which a camera is given to the downtrodden in society in hopes that their voice will be heard. Of course in this movie the technique is used to help out the children of Calcutta, and in that movie it was used to help Republicans. My main problem with this movie is that I think that it walks into some moral quicksand. How can the makers of this film condemn the area that these kids live in, then condemn those that condemn the same area.  Many shots are shown of people doing drugs, having sex, and using the C word (which begs the question: Do they have an equivalent of the C word in Calcutta or were the editors of this movie just using it to trump up their case against Calcutta?).  But who would choose this life? Yes the kids have sad lives, but so do their parents, and more than likely so did their parents and so on down the line. So to rescue them from this place is honorable, but to judge the people that are stuck there is a cheap shot. Also, you have to admit, this movie is kind of a gimmie. She takes poor kids out of Calcutta and takes them to the zoo. . .what did she expect to happen?  And while I do agree with her decision to help these kids escape, it did have a little Crusade on it (Here let the white man come in and tell you how to live your life).  That said this movie, I'm sure, does far more good than bad.  These people are poorer than you will ever be. So the next time you want to cry because you found a roach or your latte is the wrong size I seriously hope you consider these children because at least your pimp isn't setting you on fire. ***1/4",1114905600,3,2181,4.156398104265403
2354409,4,B000A2XCBC,"A foreign woman gives cameras and teaches photography to several children --the sons and daughters of prostitutes -- in the slums of Calcutta.  Their photos are interesting enough for a exhibition at a local book store and in Amsterdam. The woman, called Auntie by the children, takes her photography students to the zoo and the beach and also tries to enroll them in good schools.  She confronts prejudice against slum children, bureaucracy and Indian bureaucrats -- the best in the world, and that's no compliment.

The movie is filmed in harsh, vivid grainy colors that suit the slums. The children are adorable, but escape from the slums is portayed as nearly impossible for many of them, pulled down as they are by dope-smoking fathers and harpy mothers.  But there is also love and tenderness in some homes and the film makers hold out hope that some of the children may overcome their environment.

This is a good documentary and well worth seeing, but I would have appreciated more information about life in the slums rather than just a photographic record of it.  The photography didn't convey enough to hold my complete attention. I nodded off a few times and was impatient for the movie to end.

2354410,5,B000A2XCBC,"One of the most memorable moments in this year's Academy Awards was when Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman won the best documentary feature.  I remember the joy on Ms. Briski's face and the glow in her eyes.  I wanted to see the film as soon as possible I went to a movie theater to see it, not being patient enough to wait for it to come out on DVD.

With the opening credits I felt I was right there with the filmmakers, inside the red light district of Calcutta, one of the most depressing places on earth.  There's poverty, squalor and a feeling of hopelessness as generation after generation are sucked into a life of prostitution and crime.  But children are like children everywhere.  They're bright and curious about the world and open to learning.

For two years, the filmmakers gave classes in photography to a group of ten of these children.  They were given cameras and told to shoot film in their own neighborhoods.  Later, they looked at contact sheets and selected the best pictures, learning about composition and other photographic elements.  The children were delighted. And so were the filmmakers who managed to get some of the photographs sold in galleries in New York City.  One young boy also won a trip to a film exposition in Amsterdam.

By now it became clear that the filmmaker wanted to also change these children's lives at the critical time before they entered puberty.  It took a lot of effort and Ms. Briski managed to get a few of the children into a good boarding school.  But first there were incredible delays and obstructive paperwork and rules to follow and medical tests to take.  It was like stepping into a endless labyrinth.

It sure was a joy to think that finally some of these children would go to school and maybe, just maybe, rise above the poverty and hopelessness of their future.  Unfortunately though, most of them dropped out or were forced onto the streets by their parents.  But one young girl and one young boy were still in school by the end of the film.  My heart goes out with pity to the others who showed so much promise and who were so enthusiastic about their photographs and their prospects for the future.  It was a lesson in reality to me to realize that most of the children with the smiling faces in this documentary are already swallowed up in the quicksand of the street of Calcutta.

Applause to the filmmakers for bringing this worthwhile, but ultimately depressing, film to the screen.  It reminds me of how much I take for granted and makes me count my blessings.  I definitely recommend this film.  You will be saddened and touched and glad that the film exists. But you certainly won't be smiling.",1112400000,4,2667,4.613588110403397

2354435,1,B000A2XCBC,"This movie makes me cry, but not for the reasons the filmmakers intended. Briski and Kauffman represent the situation of sex workers' children in this poor Indian district in the most un-ethical and violent way possible -- by laying the blame at the heroic, unionized sex-worker moms that have managed to carve out a safe space for their families, under the kind of conditions that would beat any westerner down. Most reprehensibly, they raise themselves up as saviors  by treading on the back of these families. In doing so they undermine the very children they supposedly want to help, and dupe Westerners whose only access to information about Calcutta is through this film - thanks to the Academy award. I second the advice of a viewer who urges audiences instead watch the film Tales of the Night Fairies, a more caring and truthful representation, or, a film that puts Briski's supposedly caring desire to take children away from their moms into context of other British colonial moments of shame:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabbit-Proof-Fence/dp/B00005JLD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabbit-Proof Fence</a>.  Don't depend on my opinion here --- please paste into a search engine Born into Brothels with any of these names: Praveen Swami, Seema Sirohi or Partha Banerjee ---to read incisive critique of the film by more knowledgeable folks - people who worked translating it, know the district, or report on the Indian Frontline's investigation of the filmmakers unethical behavior.

The fact that the Sonagachi Red Light District where Briski et al filmed is not only the focus of MANY hardworking aid organizations (which Briski edits out, one can only assume to portray herself as the only bright shining angel) but also a case ""studied worldwide as a model of HIV prevention, sex workers organized in workers cooperatives to collectively ensure their rights and safety (instead of being controlled by pimps), and strict community rules not to force anyone into prostitution"" will astonish viewers who have seen the film. There is no way the filmmakers could not know this, or that these women began a trade union that has grown to 60,000 members far beyond this small district. In fact, the filmmakers treat these women as the cause of the children's problems, and recommend removal of the children from their families! That Briski is British, thus from India's the former colonial power, and that she recommends a removal policy without realizing that it repeats colonial violence done in other British colonies (such as the forcible kidnapping of aborigine children in Australia in 1911 by whiter skinned people who could not imagine indigenous people capable of bringing up children) makes me wonder if it might not be BRISKI, rather than the brothel kids, who has been neglected and denied a proper education.

Viewers need to know that an investigation by the Indian media Frontline showed that the film's most fundamental assumptions were false, particularly Briski's assertion that the children no education, or very little before she sent them to boarding school. In fact, ALL THE KIDS WERE GOING TO SCHOOL WHEN THE DOCUMENTARY WAS BEING MADE!

It is a testament to Briski's own ignorance and misuse of rich white power that none of the cases in which she ""removed"" kids to boarding school have resulted in success or continuation. This is because the kids know what the sadly uneducated Briski cannot see, that their families are more than props in a gringa film. That Briski dupes Western audiences into misunderstanding the real issues in India's brothels, that she bathes in the limelight and accepts Academy Awards built on this exploitation, that she presents unethical hidden camera footage taken without these poor women's consent, that she so sneakily betrays these people who had nothing, but generously shared every single intimate part of their lives with this ""savior"" should alert us that somewhere, in England, children are growing up like Briski --- without being given the basic historical knowledge they so desperately need.

Lets make a film about Briski's home town, use hidden cameras to show her friends in the worst light, and give it Bollywood's biggest award so we can finally remove poor rich white filmmakers from their neglectful colonialist parents, and give them to caring Calcuttans who will see that they receive the uncensored education they so desperately need.

In all seriousness: This ""research"" would never have survived an ethics review board investigation, and suggests that we demand stronger accountability and oversight of filmmakers to ensure ethical treatment of their subjects, especially in places where people may not have access to enforcing such accountability.

A better use for this film, and one that I use in my undergraduate classes, is to have students FIRST read Partha Banerjee's letter to the American Film Academy about the film's lack of ethics, and then watch BitB. Students marvel that the Oscar ignored his plea and awarded this film! I'll keep a DVD of this film in my college collection of ethnocentric diatribe classics such as ""Warrior Marks"" and ""Not without my daughter"" (apologies to Gidget). Like those films it embodies Gayatri Spivack's observation that so much of what passes as Western humanitarianism is less about helping victims and more about the image of ""White men saving brown women from brown men"" (in this case White women ""saving"" brown kids from brown women).

Please, lets set up a humanitarian fund to provide history classes to the poor, abused children of Britain that, like Briski, are at risk of becoming narcissistic missionary filmmakers that exploit the third world.

The film starts out with Zana Briski narrating a bit as we see footage of the Red Light District, the people who live there and the men who come to spend time with the s** workers there. The adults living there became very afraid of the cameras and they wouldn't want the shame of being filmed, so Zana and the others of the crew learned fast that chronicling their lives would be tough. Despite that, however, a minority of the mothers verbally abuse their kids even on film! The language they use to abuse their children is enough to make a sailor blush! It's terrible. Moreover, their mothers, the s** workers, treat their kids horribly as if they were little more than slaves.

Therefore, while the filmmakers originally intended to make a movie focused much more on the s** workers; they changed their minds somewhat after meeting children living in the brothels without much hope for their future. Zana Briski decides to give eight of the children a relatively simple to operate point-and-shoot camera; and she teaches them photography with regular classes to educate them and improve their self-esteem.

The children quickly learn to make photos and they savor the thrill of being able to create photos that are regarded favorably by the person they soon come to call ""Zana Auntie."" Zana goes all the way to help these kids and improve their self-esteem at the same time; we see Zana arrange for their photos to be auctioned at Sotheby's and there is even an art gallery exhibit in Calcutta. When the Indian television press crews show up with their cameras, the children's faces light up and it is amazingly touching to see just how much they sense a ray of hope for their futures. The children clearly know that their future does not lie in the Red Light District; and they state many times in this film that they do not want to grow up to be like their parents.

Poor Zana! She tries so hard to get these children out of the homes they live in and into a better environment. We see Zana running around in an endless bureaucratic, red-tape lined machine as she struggles to get these kids into boarding schools so they won't have to go home too often; the kids can then get away from the bad influences of their parents' ways.

Believe it or not, I haven't given everything away up to this point in the film and I don't want to spoil it for anybody by giving away too much more. There's good and there's bad; but suffice it to say this is an outstanding documentary that moves both the heart and the mind.

Overall, Born Into Brothels is not always easy to take but when you watch this film the empathy you feel for these kids makes you hope they can achieve a brighter future. The filmmakers tried so hard to help them; and in the meanwhile a fine documentary was produced. I highly recommend this film.",1235347200,,3235,4.568965517241379
2354448,3,B000A2XCBC,"Sonagachi is the infamous red light district in Calcutta, where brothels abound, and prostitution is a way of life. ""Born Into Brothels"" is an award-winning documentary that focuses on a group of children born into this seedy environment, and who are mentored by a Western photographer, Zana Briski who teaches them photography in the hopes of fostering their dreams for a better future.

I think Ms Briski has her heart in the right place - she opens the minds of these underprivileged children to a world that they probably would never have given much thought to otherwise. Teaching them to take pictures made them 'see' another world outside their poverty-ridden neighborhood, to appreciate little accomplishments even in their deprived circumstances, and to dream of a better life.

That being said - though her efforts here are laudable, it is obvious through the course of the documentary and at the end, that 'rescuing' these children was never an easy task, nor something that had the guarantee of success. This doesn't diminish her efforts, but it does give us pause for thought - what could have been done to ensure these and other children in similar plight would be spared the fate awaiting them - a life of selling one's body for pittance, debasement, and a never-ending cycle of abuse and poverty. Education was promoted as the key to the childrens' futures here, but in reality all but two of the children chose to remain in the boarding schools that Ms Briski had painstakingly got them admitted into.

In reality, there are no easy answers. The documentary does a wonderful job of showing these children with their dreams of a brighter tomorrow. It also paints a dreary picture of their living conditions in the brothel, of the verbal abuse they bear and have to listen to, almost on a daily basis [""prostitute talk""] and of the utter hopelessness of their lives, which many of them seem to bear stoically. Though this may seem remarkable to many, these children know of no other life, and it is 'normal' for them to live the way they do. Ms Brinski tries valiantly to pluck them away from the brothels, but ultimately, many of them choose to return or have no say in the matter, having 'lost' their 'voices' the moment they were born into the brothels.

I watched another documentary recently [can't recall the title], that focused on the efforts of a Nepalese teenager & ex-prostitute who also tries to rescue girls from the brothels in Mumbai, and in fact goes undercover to 'kidnap' these girls and admit them into shelters and schools for exploited children/girls. Just as in Ms Briski's case, some of her rescuees returned to the brothels of their own accord. In many of these failed cases of rescue, it seems the family relationships that binds these girls and children are just too complex to be unravelled. Many of these exploited children are emotionally bound to their families and have been drilled since young to believe they have a duty to their family, to go into the 'profession' and accept responsibility, to feed the aging members of their family, many of whom continue to reside in the brothels long after 'retirement' and to their dying day - it's not just mothers, but grandmothers, aunts, and yes, the parasitical men who feed off their daughters, sisters and wives.

In conclusion - this DVD provides an interesting insight into the lives of a couple of these 'brothel children', yet it by no means provides a complete account of the whys & hows nor does it address the means to ensure a higher rate of success at rescuing these at-risk children.",1232755200,7,3586,4.814935064935065
2354449,5,B000A2XCBC,"*Born into Brothels* is a documentary worth watching.  Zana Briski came to Calcutta to film the Indian women working the ""red light district"".  However, her attention is soon turned to the prostitutes' children living in the brothels.

What's special about this documentary is that Briski doesn't just film these children.  She decided to give them a skill that they could use in their life.  She introduced them to photography.  Obviously, she is a brilliant teacher because the children take into account of the lessons and feedback.  The photos, by these children, soon catches international attention.

However, developing a life skill doesn't mean that the children are free from their parents' wishes...especially the girls.  If the women feel that these girls need to train for the brothels, they have no choice but to adhere.

So, this sets Briski on another mission which is to find schools that will accept these children.  The problem is that many of these schools are parochial and will not accept children of prostitutes.  In addition, these schools require so many documents that it is a headache.

When Briski does find schools that will accept the children, she must address and convince the parents to let them go.

All I can say is that this film is heartbreaking.  These children live a gritty life, yet they have dreams of their own.  Even better, they have a talent in photography.  However, their fate lies in the hands of their parents.",1208390400,,1459,4.962809917355372

Of course, for this part, she needs to bring a video camera to record her do-good heroism. I don't suppose she strategized at all with documentary-makers about what would be the best way to approach the subject matter, so as to generate maximum sales of the film? Yes, apparently $100,000 was raised for the kids through certain fundraisers, AS Briski was engaged with them in making this documentary, but where did all the money go from the rights to this Academy Award winning (and 29 other awards) documentary, which came out AFTER she was done with these kids?

At best this is a documentary about a bleeding-heart liberal's ineffective efforts to help needy kids; at worst it is a crass exploitation of a bad situation, orchestrated to bring praise from mankind, along with the lucrative royalties checks.

The one redeeming value of this film, and why I could give it at least two stars, is that: Whatever Briski's motives or ultimate impact on the kids, at least she did do the world a service by highlighting the problem.

The little girls are basically being primed by their families to become working ""girls"" at a very young age to earn money for the family.

2354462,5,B000A2XCBC,"The story told in Born into Brothels was the tragic loss of innocence. Beautiful children, whose mothers are prostitutes, seem doomed to carry on the tradition. Although young and innocent, the children seem to have learned to accept life as sad and painful. Their lot in life seems horrendous and warrants social action. I would hope that, if placed in a similar situation as Auntie Zana, I would also feel compelled to act. In the case of Auntie Zana, servant leadership appears to be the paternalistic to switch from controlling leader to nurturing leader. Did she empower any of the children? Clearly, she provided them a new skill - photography. She provided the students with experiences they may have not otherwise experienced, such as the trip to the beach and the zoo. Obviously, she was endeared to them, but did she empower them? In the end, her means to empowerment was to enroll each child in a school. In other words, she had to find someone else to save the children. As the saying goes, if you give someone a fish, they eat for a day, if you teach them to fish, they eat for life. To me, a more empowering action should have been to instigate the formation of a new school with the purpose of serving marginalized children. Possibly she could have contacted the Peace Corps, or some other international agency, for assistance. Nonetheless, I believe her greatest service was public awareness. Before there can be concerted action, there must be awareness. She provided a narrative to the American public that is impossible to ignore.",1193875200,4,1549,4.805243445692884

As a teacher, I have found that despite life's hardships, children are resolute survivors and this film reinforced this belief.  While many of us cannot even imagine the life of being raised in a brothel, we can easily imagine our own selves joining the quest in which Zana Briski embarks to improve the children's lives.  We understand the importance of sending them to a good school and getting them out of their horrible surroundings so they can make something more of themselves. However, they're still children, and the importance of living a life with which they are familiar -- mom, sisters, brothers, friends, HOME -- is more important to them than anything else in the world.  While I was shocked at hearing the ""where are they now?"" portion of the film, I was not in the least bit surprised.

I have to say this, any one who has never been to India, has no idea of what it is really like. I have several friends and a fiancee there, but have not been able to go yet. So I started immersing myself in the world of Bollywood a few years ago. I love musicals, the stories are funny but tragic, but fairly unfulling unless it is a historical piece. But lately, I've begun to watch the documentories instead. This, is how one learns more about the true country.

The kids in this movie completly drew me in. I wonder every day, where they are, what they are doing, how many have escaped. I am amazed at how they can incorporate living a grown up life, into their childhood. They are not mad at their situations. They are matter of fact instead.

Born into brothels is heart wrenching, and I don't see how ANYONE w/ a soul could rate it less than five stars. I've joined the mailing list on the kids w/ cameras website and will be donating as well.

2354471,5,B000A2XCBC,"Born Into Brothels offers a very raw (and I'm talking Digital Video raw, as well as emotionally and visually raw) view of the lives of several children in the red light district brothels of Calcutta. All of their mothers work in the brothels as prostitutes, and these children have almost no hope of a future, until Zana Briski comes along and begins to teach them photography.

This is the central part of the story Born Into Brothels is telling. As these children take photography lessons with Zana, she becomes more and more attached to them, and begins a mission to try and provide them with a future by getting them into boarding schools and organizing photography exhibits for them.

Watching her struggle to accomplish such tasks as getting a passport so one child can travel to Amsterdam for a photography conference, and getting the children tested for HIV is as much heartbreaking as uplifting. Seeing how much good one person can accomplish with little more than willpower is really what makes Born Into Brothels such a great documentary, and probably what made it win the Academy Award.

The DVD includes several special features, including a segment called ""Reconnecting"" where the filmmakers go back to Calcutta three years after the film was made and check in with the children to see where they are in life. For the most part, it is all good news, and even more uplifting to see how well they are doing. There is also a segment showing the children watching the DVD and giving commentary. It's funny watching the funny parts, but even more powerful seeing their reactions to the tragic and sad parts. ""At least you are doing better now,"" remarks one student to another when she starts crying viewing her past self on the screen. ""You can't live in the past.""

But another student, one of the most insightful throughout, says ""You can't forget the past either."" This DVD, along with all the special features, shows that where there is someone willing to help others, there is the possibility of change and improvement in even the most squalid living situations. Born Into Brothels will leave you with a feeling of hope and pride in the human race, as well as the desire to spend more time helping others.",1170115200,4,2219,4.770833333333333
2354472,5,B000A2XCBC,"n 1998 photojournalist Zana Briski moved to a red light district in Calcutta to document the lives of prostitutes. After three years she discovered that the children born into these brothels were fascinated by her camera. Knowing that these kids were destined to a life of sex slavery, drugs and violence, one day she brought the kids ten point-n-shoot cameras and formed a workshop to help them discover the beauty of their own lives through the liberating power of art. This film won the 2005 Academy Award for best documentary, and follows the ""class"" of nine kids she gathered. Through dogged perseverance Briski was able to get several of the kids into private boarding schools, and even one of them to a major American university. Later she started a foundation called Kids With Cameras that now works in Calcutta, Haiti, Cairo and Jerusalem. There is also a book of the children's photography called Born Into Brothels: Photographs By the Children of Calcutta. Much like the films City of God shot in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and Promises about Palestinian and Israeli kids, Born into Brothels reminds us how much adults have to learn from children.",1169596800,5,1159,4.888324873096447
2354473,5,B000A2XCBC,"Prostitution, as with many other vocations in India, is often an inherited trade.  Daughters of prostitutes are almost certain to ""join the line.""  One of the children featured in this documentary comes from a long line of prostitutes; her mother, grandmother and great grandmother were all prostitutes.  Her fate and the fate of a small group of other children who were born into the same brothel may now be altered because of a visiting photographer.

Zana Briski had chosen the inhabitants of one of Calcutta's red light districts as the subject for her work.  Briski decided that the only way to successfully photograph the women was to live among them.  Having secured a place with the prostitutes, she met their children right away.  Her curiosity is matched by theirs and she becomes very interested in them as she teaches them how to use cameras and edit their work.  New talents surface in the class and the children's response to learning photography is positive and hopeful.

Briski's concern for their futures leads her to work feverishly on making education available to these children.  For the first time in their lives the children imagine leaving their home for boarding school and growing beyond any expectations previously placed on them by others.  Briski's hope to help these children is echoed by family members of some of the children.  The adults who long ago resigned to the unfortunate facts of their lives and their professions are visibly moved by the idea that perhaps their children and grandchildren could escape the same fate.

The formal elements of this documentary are not what cause it to stand out in my mind.  The subject matter is important and the story of one woman's struggle to affect the world in a meaningful way are enough reason to rate this as five stars.

Take a look at the lives of prostitutes in Las Vegas, L.A., New York - and will those scenes be any different from the red light district in Calcutta?

Has he ever seen life of the homeless and prostitutes living under the bridges and overpasses of our great American cities?

The movie was beautifully-crafted, amazing, and sad - and I do appreciate the photographers' effort to ""do good"" for the kids by helping them to discover their hidden talents.

Rather than exploring the darkness that penetrates and poisons a thing bright, an equation slathered up by filmmakers such as Mike Leigh, Todd Solondz, Luis Bunuel, Orson Welles, John Cassavettes, Atom Egoyan, Stanley Kubrick and so forth with gusto, directors Ross Kaufmann and Zana Briski have managed here to celebrate the beauty that survives within degradation. Many doubts, like life, surface during the film, but I can think of no greater testament to hope than the spark of creativity burning in the eyes of these children who live like caged beasts, but refuse to be beaten down. Briski is a photographer who has for years lived with the prostitutes of Calcutta's red light district, a sort of ground zero for moral decay that makes San Francisco's Tenderloin district look like a country club in comparison. Mingling with the brothels' kids, she decides to teach them photography as a form of communication, to see how they view their world. These kids, who are furnished with their own cameras, turn out to have a wealth of creativity and she works to save them from a future living the same destitute lives as their mothers. One girl is beaten by her father and mother on a daily basis. Another girl is never allowed to leave her house, and would likely never have ventured outdoors had it not been for Briski coordinating trips to the zoo and a water park. All the girls do chores from sunup to sundown and are privy to so much verbal and physical abuse that they are resigned to lives in which pain and sadness are as certain as the sun and the moon. But by film's end, you learn that at least a few of these brothel descendants  will be furnished with all the tools to dig their way out.",1154390400,3,1770,4.60126582278481

She also tried to get them into schools. A few she managed to enroll. One child was gifted and went to Amsterdam for a presentation of his work. He was at a crossroads in in his whether he would choose to stay in the Calcutta slums or to school. That trip help him to decide school.

Sadly, most of the kids she couldn't help but a lucky few will move on to a better life. The photographer,Zana Briski, tried very hard but some children's caretakers thwarted her efforts, sometimes the children made bad decisions that ruined their chances for emancipation from their heartbreaking conditions.

2354486,5,B000A2XCBC,"As a child, I lived for six months in India.  I love to read books or watch films which depict the beauty and heartbreak of this amazing country.  With this in mind, I rented the movie and hoped to share some of my memories with my two daughters.

My daughters, 11 and 13, aren't usually excited about documentaries.  Within ten minutes they were hooked.  We were taken into the lives of some children from a particular red light district.  We saw their joy, personalities, struggles, abuse, and the eventual dark lives that awaited each of them.  Yet, through the gift of art and photography, we saw them come alive with new hopes and goals.

The story is told without emotional saturation; it shows very little of the exploitation that goes on in the mothers' lives as prostitutes; but it manages to stir our empathy for this handful of children.  By the end, I had tears in my eyes.  I was happy for those who broke free from dismal futures, and I was torn up by the thought of the lives some of them are now forced to lead.

The work of Auntie Zana, the woman who teaches them photography, is wonderful.  She shows true care for the kids, fighting for their educations and futures.  Jesus said, ""Let the little ones come unto me,"" and that's the type of love Zana personifies here.  It's a beautiful thing.",1144886400,8,1310,4.495762711864407
2354487,5,B000A2XCBC,"Quite simply this is a film that chronicles two foreign photographers, Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman's determined efforts to expose a hidden world that is Calcutta's red light district.

A hidden world that is ignored by those lucky enough not to live in it.

Zana who had lived in India on and off for many years had the idea to bring together a group of children, the sons and daughters of prostitutes living in the red light distrct to photograph the world in which they lived, worked and played in.

Armed with basic cameras the children find an outlet in photography, each child showing a different flair in portraying the imagery around them, from their families, the squalor on the streets, a trip to the seaside, a visit to the zoo, every picture tells a story of that child and his or her interaction with those around them.

Be prepared when watching this documentary for strong language, and powerful imagery in the guise of simple statements like, ""I have no hope"" along with the knowledge that some of these children will not leave the red light district despite the help they are being given by Zana and Ross.

The ties that bind are strong, and many of the young girls accept, albeit reluctantly the fact they will one day take up the work of their mothers whilst their husbands and male siblings look on helplessly, because they are unable to provide for them, and therefore life as a sex worker will at least put food in the bellies of hungry children.

This is not a perfect documentary in any sense of the word but is in fact a snapshot into a world most of us will never venture into because we are very lucky here in the West, we were not born into brothels, we are not Calcutta's red light kids and most of all we are not destined ""walk the line"" as fallen women whose legacy for their children is tragic as it is sordid.",1144540800,11,1843,4.470238095238095

Americans do not place the same importance on family obligation that many other cultures do.  It doesn't matter that the family obligation is to become a prostitute to support your family; it's still expected from these children and all that they know.

Introducing the children to photography and taking them on field trips has changed their lives forever. Whether they go to boarding school or into prostitution they still have some important life experiences that they would not otherwise have had.

This movie is both enlightening and depressing.  While in the end it is depressing that all of the families do not take advantage of the ""great"" opportunities presented to their children, one has to appreciate the difference that one person can make in the lives of others.",1143072000,3,897,4.993288590604027

I wonder if the filming wasn't started for a different project and then got used for this film when they realized the ""born into brothels"" theme was catchier than ""slum kids doing photography"". Zani got to know some calcutta slum kids via a program to get them to take photographs. Then she became friends with them all and tried to improve their situations and futures. As a former aid worker, I can tell you that this is a very typical scenario. It's not about brothels -- it could have been any slum, the brothels weren't actual brothels, but rather a red-light district -- but about getting the kids into boarding schools and into photo contests. Passports. Beauracracy. Red tape. It raised interesting issues that it did not bother to further investigate: nature versus nuture-- that even though the parent or parents had a chance to put their kid in school and get, maybe, a better life, when it came down to actually doing it, fewer than half allowed the kids to go. So is the idea of parents wanting a better life for their children not univeral? Born to trailer trash, doomed to be trailer trash? There was also that the multi-generational households expected ""needed"" the kids for...housework. Care. Doing for them in a way they probably did for their mothers and grandmothers. It was more of an obligation that just ""we'll miss her too much."" So...I love documentaries, but thought for all effort this should have been better.",1142467200,20,1541,4.840909090909091
2354490,5,B000A2XCBC,"This is a beautiful, haunting film that follows the lives of eight children from Calcutta who's parents work in the red light district.  A woman photographer who went to India and chose to live in the red light district to photograph it ends up befriending the children.  Though unplanned, she answers the children's requests to teach them photography and ultimately works to get them out of the district.  It is almost certain that if she does not, the girls will become prostitutes themselves, the boys also participating in illegal activities and little or no hope that they will ever get out of the vicious cycle.

Their journey is one of strength, hope, understanding, perserverence and ultimately, love.  Though the children's situation is sad and unbearable, in the end, there is hope.  And it shows how art can lift the spirit and change lives forever.

I want to address something that one reviewer who gave the movie two stars mentioned.  He/she said that Zana Briski promised hope and didn't deliver.  The reviewer also said that there was nothing mentioned about who owned the copyright to the photographs of the children, and that they were being exploited.  Neither of these comments are true.

Ms. Briski noted several times throughout the film that the proceeds of the sales of the photos was to go toward the children's education.  More information on this is below.

*NOTE:  If you don't want to know what happens, just trust the above comments and stop reading here*

Ms. Briski goes more in depth in the special features sections to reveal that these children have been promised whatever education they desire, including university education, and it was to be funded through the profits of the movie as well as the continued sale of their photographs in any form.

By the end of the film, Ms. Briski (who worked extremely hard to help these margainalized children) had indeed gotten several of the children out of the brothels.  If you continue on to view the followups in the special features section, you will find that all of the children were offered opportunities to an education, although one girl had not accepted the offer at the end of the filming of special sections.  These choices were left up to the children and their families.

Zana Briski has now founded an organization called ""Kids With Cameras"" that manages the funds raised from the sales of the children's images, as well as the film.  So much money has now been raised that not only are the children in the film offered a full education at university, she is in the process of opening a school specifically for the children of the red light district.  (Due to their parents engaging in criminal activities, most schools will not accept them).  Additional funds were used to fund similar photography projects with margainalized children around the world.

The children of Calcutta are fully aware of what the money is being used for.  They are all for it.

Therefore I am disputing the facts of the poster below.  All of the evidence of the love and care offered these children is included in the DVD.",1141516800,10,3092,4.830798479087452

2354492,5,B000A2XCBC,"... from the comfort of your armchair.  This film has inspired a fascinating array of responses, from great praise and a Best Documentary Oscar to condemnation as self-promoting exploitation of innocent kids.  There is a review here from earlier this year that typifies the latter that has an amazing number of helpful votes despite being based on nothing more than misinformation and unfounded innuendo.  A translator who worked on the film has condemned it as well.  There seems to be a clash of facts here, which I will try to set straight as far as I can.

It is evident that the filmmaker, Zana Briski, set out with somewhat naive expectations that she could just give out cameras to children in these very harsh circumstances and then film as a thousand flowers bloomed.  She quickly learned otherwise.  But as the film goes on and she sees she must do more if she's going to have any lasting effect for the children, she does do more.  Among other things, she eventually set up a nonprofit organization to fund the education of the children, and though not all has gone well for them, a follow-up on the DVD shows the children have succeeded in various ways not acknowledged by the critics of the film's motives, including the Indian translator, who makes it seem as if nothing went well.  It has been speculated by some other Indians who have seen the film and read the criticism that some of the adverse reaction is due to embarrassment at seeing a shameful part of India shown so frankly by an outsider to outsiders.  That kind of concern would undoubtedly arise anywhere Briski went, since she is not herself from a brothel or similarly unfortunate circumstances.  That doesn't mean she shouldn't have gone there or made the film, though if she had made it knowing what she does now about the sensitivities, maybe she would have done some things differently.  In any case, the facts reported by Briski, who is still in touch with the kids, don't match the ones complained about by her critics, who aren't.

As you view the film, keep in mind that, whatever the flaws of the film and its maker, the fact is that, unlike the critics, she actually went and did something.  More information about the foundation Briski founded, which has grown beyond Calcutta in its efforts, as well as information about the kids in the film, can be found at the Kids With Cameras foundation website.  The foundation claims that 100% of the proceeds from the photos used in the film and in calendars and so on has gone to the education fund.  (The news page at the site seems to be out of date, so I don't know how active it is presently.)",1140307200,6,2630,4.623655913978495

For this reason and more ""Born into Brothels"" is beautiful.  It tells the story of a photographer who moves into Calcutta's red light district thinking she would capture the lives of the women, but ends-up falling in love with their children instead.  She gives these children cameras and teaches them photography, which opens a new world to them - a world she hopes will lead to a better life.  She even gets them a show at Sotheby's in an effort to raise funds for their education.  It is not easy, though: some of their parents want them to follow in their footsteps, while others are reluctant to leave what they know.

I was struck most by the way the children spoke - some of the things they said were so poetic and sweet!  Two of my favorite quotes were:

""I like the way Puja behaves.  Whenever she eats something, she shares it with others...you don't even have to ask.""
""This is why I like photography: I want to put forth the behavior of man.""

The children were both innocent and mature.  One can not help but pull for them.

If you want to feel sorry for these children you might want to look around at children everywhere in the world and see how they/we are all robbed eventually of what it means to be a child. Yes, life is rough for these particular children, but they are just a handful of what are millions of children facing similar situations all over the world including every city in the United States. It is really easy to get wired into the lives of these particular children and want to know what happens to them later on when all you have to do is visit the streets of any city at night and you will see the children as they will be as adults; prostitutes, pimps, drug addicts, homeless, and all in your own backyard. The message of this movie is to help all of us, not just these handful of children. If you feel bad, help your own children, your nieces and nephews, neighbors children and so on.

That is exactly what filmmaker Zana Briski did and for this reason I gave her pseudo-documentary, ""Born into Brothels,"" only 2 stars - one of which is for the children she profiles and the other of which is for the amazing images they produced.

In the film's first half, Briski teaches a handful of children who live in Calcutta's notorious red light district to tell stories - of their families, their neighborhood, their fears and their hopes and dreams - through a camera lens. Under Briski's tutelage, we see their harsh lives exposed with haunting beauty.

In the second half, though, Briski tries to get the children out of the sex ghetto and into boarding schools. She ignores the financial burden the children are expected to assume as they come of age with the girls becoming prostitutes and the boys becoming pimps and drug dealers. Artistic and educational ambitions collide with the family's financial demands and caste-system status with heartbreaking consequences.

Briski ends up perpetuating the very thing her film thought to expose - the exploitation of children - by using their story, photos and outcome to frame her Oscar-winning movie (Briski doesn't say who owns the copyrights and licensing rights to the children's photographs which were used throughout the film and in promotional materials, published in a book by the same name, featured on an Amnesty International calendar, were shown and sold in art galleries, or whether their participation in this HBO-financed film was compensated).

For the children involved in it I believe it is much more than just a well made movie.  It is a chance to change their lives for the better.

Reading through the reviews I have seen much criticism of Ms. Briski for being patronizing and self serving in her interactions with the children of Calcutta.  I think these statements reflect more on the cynicism and narrow views of the reviewers than on Ms. Briski.  I believe a more observant viewer could see the genuine concern and caring she had for these children and would realize that she focused on ACTIONS not words in helping these children.  It is her ACTIONS that helped some of these children to exit the cycle of poverty that they were previously resigned to.  It is her ACTIONS (in time and effort) that helped create a worldwide charity to help these and other children in poverty.  It is her ACTIONS that produced a film that brings worldwide attention to this cause.

2354500,5,B000A2XCBC,"The American film documentary in recent years (2003 to 2005)  has seen an explosion in great film art work.  Recent examples include, ""The Fog of War"", ""The Weather Underground"", ""Super Size Me"", ""Enron"", and the acclaimed film, ""Born Into Brothels"".

Of the many injustices in the world, few stir us to action like the ones directed against the weak, the defenseless, and the assailable...and it's the documentary film's job to lay out these stories of injustices in an articulate way.

The film itself treats this subject matter as an opportunity for hope and redemption by the use of creativity and imagination in the children.  We see the line of reality, which is always blightful, and the hope and promise of the children, blurred.  This creates the films conflict.  It's a very compelling struggle to watch for 90 minutes and you can't take your eyes off the screen.

We see filmmaker / director Zana Briski buying the children auto reflex cameras...Briski picked up a Panasonic mini-DV and began to film them, allowing the children to address the camera directly and to discuss their experiences taking pictures.

This leads us into their troubled homes and deeper into their chaotic lives. Briski soon realized she needed a cinematographer and in 2001 convinced Ross Kauffman, a documentary film editor, to join her in Calcutta.

Briski and Kauffman, new to the art and craft of directing, obviously could not agree on whether the documentary should be Briski's story or the children's. When Briski is on-camera, Born into Brothels becomes discursive, following her efforts to get the children into boarding schools, which require her to navigate the labyrinthine Indian bureaucracy, as well as the equally daunting web of social and cultural tradition that circumscribes the lives of the children.

in these sequences, the children are thrust to the background. Despite the film's lack of cohesiveness, Briski and Kauffman exhibit a keen eye for images that immediately communicate the dismal existence of those forced to live in the red-light district.

I won't go into further detail about the story or the main themes...it will blow the surprise ending, but I need to discuss something that works out very well here.  Team Briski do a great job of the film's pacing.  This is absolutely crucial in any motion picture experience, but more so in Documentaries.  It's very difficult to master the pacing in a feature or short docuumentary.  I can attest to that and somehow Briski makes it work.

2354502,4,B000A2XCBC,"This documentary focuses on the children of the prostitutes of Calcutta's red light district and their introduction to photography. It provides only a glancing glimpse into their lives, as the filmmakers were often prohibited from filming in the brothels. This can be disappointing to those who are looking for more of an expose type of documentary.  Still, the eight children upon whom the filmmakers focus charm the viewer with a fresh-faced, hopeful innocence that often belies the knowing look in their eyes, as they are all fully aware of what it is that their mothers do for a living.

The filmmakers make a concerted effort to provide these children with alternatives to the lifestyle that they see every day and passes for the norm within the red light district. Initially, they simply teach them the art of photography, so that they may be able to express themselves through photographs. The children earn some international acclaim for their efforts, and the filmmakers begin a financial trust account for the children as prints of their photographs rack up sales. Later, they try to ensure that the children have an opportunity for an education that will expose them to a larger world view and allow them to make an informed choice as to what they can do in life. Some of the children take advantage of the opportunities presented, while others do not.

The film is somewhat choppy, as it is comprised of an amalgamation of still photography and video and, at times, lacks some coherence, despite the subtitles. Consequently, when I first saw the film, I was disappointed. I decided to view it a second time; this time with the filmmakers running commentary, and it made a difference. The commentary provided some much needed cohesion. In the final analysis, however,  I was quite surprised to learn that this film won an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2005, given some of its shortcomings.",1132963200,20,1908,4.934579439252336
2354503,4,B000A2XCBC,"""Born Into Brothels"" is about a group of poverty stricken kids who live in Calcutta's red light district. Co-director, participant and narraror Zana Briski had originally planned to make a documentary about the lives of the prostitutes there. But instead began a project to show the kids how to use cameras and then have them take photographs of their neighborhood.

What makes this movie work is that the kids are so charming and full of life. Their families and the world that surrounds them is generally grim and oppressive. But the kids themselves are full of laughter and fun as they somehow manage to make the best of an extraordinarily difficult environment. The kids also turn out to be talented photographers who ably film the harsh reality they live in. I once spent 3 months backpacking around India myself. So I can say from personal experience that they really did capture the true street life of India.

Unfortunately, there was one aspect that did drag the movie down a bit - the lousy personality and attitude of Zana Briski herself. She is usually shown to be very cold and harsh in her own interactions with the kids. She also comes across as a very self-righteous and self-important person who believes that only she can save them from lives that are ""doomed"". It's great that she introduces the kids to photography and gives them some attention, which obviously helps build their confidence. She also manages to get some of the kids into better schools. But the reality is that Briski is able to return to a life of fame and fortune as a critically acclaimed film maker. Meanwhile, most of the kids are still stuck in the slums of Calcutta, trying to make it as best they can. I believe it is they, rather than Briski, that really deserve the Oscar, as well a good portion of the earnings, for making this movie as good as it was.

Get your mitts on this documentary and you'll see first-hand what can happen when a single person receives and embraces a vision that tanscends the scope of their own ability and resources and conects with the hearts and passions of people for whom ""hope"" isn't just a word that's hard to define, but that's completely unknown.

2354507,5,B000A2XCBC,"BORN INTO BROTHELS won the Academy Award for documentaries: it should have also won the Humanitarian Award.  Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman have not only created a captivating film about the plight and survival instincts of a group of eight children who were born to prostitutes in the red light district of Calcutta: they have given us a visual montage of the images captured by these children, through the cameras as lovingly instructed by Briski, that look back at the environment in which they are living.

Without being the least bit preachy, Briski and Kauffman entered the infamous red light district, moved in so as not to seem voyeurs, and while Briski continued her long and successful portfolio of the women who ply their wares as the only means to overcome poverty, they discovered that the children of the prostitutes were curious, bright, and desirous of learning the magic the camera can produce.  We meet each of the eight children (three boys and five girls), learn the background and outlook of each and then watch as they embrace photography.  Their photographs are so fine and their futures so grim that Briski and Kauffman pledge themselves to find paths of escape from their doomed state.  Briski works to place them in boarding schools and enters their photographs in an international Press Group exhibition in Amsterdam.  The children have such pride and personal growth that they are thrilled when on boy is selected to represent them at the exhibition in Amsterdam. Briski also arranges for exhibitions of the photographs, both internationally and locally so that all of the children can view their art in a respected place.  Yet after elevating the future outlook of these eight children we see that only a few continue to have bright futures: the shame of their social caste and the mark of their 'criminal' parents is stamped on them forever.  Some escape, others join the line.

The photography is splendid, rich in color and subject matter, and the video camera following Briski through the squalid red light district, pausing to hear abusive mothers and drugged fathers deny their children passage into a better life, hearing the wisdom of the elders who desire something more for these children, captures a world few know.  Devoted as Briski and Kauffman are to their dream, they remain realistic and document an element of life in a third world country that is illuminating.

This is a touching film without being maudlin, beautiful without ignoring reality. In English and with subtitles for the children's commentary.  Highly Recommended for all viewers.  Grady Harp, November 05",1130889600,5,2614,5.023148148148148
2354508,5,B000A2XCBC,"Seems like a lot of the negative reviews of this film on Amazon are coming from 2 types of people: 1. hopeless retards with antiquated DVD players who don't even know how to turn on the friggin' subtitles, and 2. people with socioeconomic guilt trips who don't want to be aware that they have socioeconomic guilt trips, and resent anyone who might provoke these repressed guilt trips.

I did not find this at all a ""White (Wo)Man's Burden"" kind of film, in fact Zana Briski came across as a very professional and mature individual who successfully does the highest duty of any journalist: to simply present a picture of things as they are, without shoving her own judgements or prescriptions down our throats.  I didn't find her efforts to put the kids into boarding schools at all self-serving or self-promoting, but rather as the least that she could do for them, just like most people who walk past a drowning child would not hesitate to jump in and rescue the child.

(Of course the fact that Ms. Briski is very easy on the eyes doesn't hurt either, LOL!)

In fact this film is remarkably sensitive to the real-world circumstances and limitations of its subjects.  For instance at the end, when it details what happens to the kids who were put in the boarding schools, it does so in a very neutral, matter-of-fact tone rather than a melodramatic or judgemental way.

This was an invaluable look into a world that normally never makes it into most people's living rooms.",1130457600,6,1473,4.689922480620155
2354509,2,B000A2XCBC,"I heard about this movie and thought it would be fascinating to watch and worth my time. I was greatly disappointed, however. In fact, this has to be one of the most overrated documentaries of all time. From a visual point of view, of course, it is breathtaking. The photography is brilliant. For that reason, and also due to it being a primary source document, I have to award it two stars; however, intellectually, the film is thin gruel. It does not educate its audience about anything outside of itself. At only 80 minutes, it certainly had time with which to do so. A brief overview as to the history of prostitution in Calcutta would have been helpful at the very least.

I looked up online an article concerning Born Into Brothels, and it asked the question as to whether it was art or activism. Well, it definitely has artistic merit, and the photography can, as I mentioned, be stunning, but it cannot possibly be activism because it fails to paint a coherent picture of how this situation came about or why it will not improve in the future. The filmmakers do not seem to understand the children as individuals. One can place them into group portraits, but their futures will be largely independent of one another.

Zana Briski, the Mother Theresa of this documentary, has a personality which is rather troublesome. She frequents the Red Light District for years, out of supposed devotion, but she speaks to the children, without a hint of warmth. Indeed, she says to the one kid about his possible desire to avoid going to a foreign school: ""If you don't want to go you don't have to, but there's nothing more I can do or want to do."" I believe her. If her devotion was not returned, I'm sure she was through with them.

Briski's demeanor towards these children is Molotov-esque. One wonders what their reactions would be to such a person were they not in such dire straits. She definitely seems to be there out of a desire to feel self-righteous. I don't remember her smiling once during the film. The children are born into miserable circumstances, yet they find moments of great joy in their daily lives. Too bad we cannot say the same about their saviors. As Briski says, if she doesn't get them out of there, ""they're doomed."" Well, I hope not, but I do think that there are dimensions of this world outside of what we see, and I am reluctant to say that anybody is necessarily ""doomed"" at age 8. Such a statement tells us more about the condescension of the speaker than of the prospects of the child. One almost expects Briski to turn to the camera at the end and announce, ""Without me, there is nothing!"" Well, at least there are these resilient vibrant children to remember.",1130457600,22,2694,4.596673596673597

And then, watching the bonus materials (of 3 years later, which should be part of the film itself), there they were.  Grrr.....  I watched most of the film in fast forward because I couldn't understand what anyone was saying.  I've never had a problem like this, but see that I am not the only one.  BUT, some scenes transcend language.  When those kids went to the beach, and then back home, I cried.  It was so poignant, both at the beach, and then back home.

Picture Mr. Toad's Wild Ride on about three hits of acid, multiply that by ten, and you might scratch the surface, though probably not.

2354512,5,B000A2XCBC,"Born into Brothels is one of the best documentaries I have seen.  But like everything else, your past experience and understanding of world issues will determine how good this documentary is to you.
  It brings light to an issue that is often kept away from the luxuries that American eyes are accustom to.  It focuses on the deplorable conditions that a group of children are living in due to politics of their country.  (India was colonized by the British which had a detrimental effect on the country's economy.  I would recommend watching Ghandi to gain a proper perspective)
  Despite the conditions, the children have unbelieveable motivation, intelligence and talent...strangely enough...in photography.  The producer of the movie purchases several cameras and places them in the hands of the children.  They go out on their own and take snapshots of what they are exposed to daily.  Some of the pictures are so amazing, they end up on display at several galleries.
  This is a rags to riches story...without the riches.  And that's why I think most people who reviewed this documentary don't like it.  Most American movies have trained the viewer to expect everything to work out ok with the violins playing on cue.  And in the real world...as this documentary portrays, most of the time it doesn't end like that.
  I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the producer of the movie for bringing a voice of the poor to the silver screen to make people aware of how others are living who are less fortunate.  This is a wonderful documentary...just keep in mind, that the world's pastures aren't as green as many would like them to be.",1128384000,2,1650,4.828571428571428
2354513,1,B000A2XCBC,"Call me cynical but I was totally disgusted with this documentary.  I can believe this won an oscar because people, especially Americans tend to love this kind of stuff.

Unfortunately,this wasn't a film about children born in brothels as much as it was about the woman making the documentary and how she set out to help them.  I found it to be a self-serving ego trip for her and condescending toward the Indian families who lived in the brothel.

The children, who knew no other way of life before the film maker showed up, seemed to accept their lives.  They appeared to be normal, well-adjusted, and happy kids...at first.  But the more the documentarian hangs around, the more the kids begin to see themselves as victims.  Then she takes them to the zoo and to the beach.  She has them take photos and tells them how artistic they are.  Then, through her connections, the photos are auctioned off at Sotheby's and the kids get to attend their own art gallery showing.  Kind of like giving them a taste of the life they'll always wish they could have, but ultimately never will.  She gets their hopes up but we know that when her filming is over, nothing will have changed for them.

The woman is Indian-American with westernized views.  She goes to India and obviously wants to make a postive difference in these kids lives, but she seems completely ignorant to the fact that different societies don't have Western views nor should they.  It's Indian culture, not western culture so why show up and push your western standards on them?

I assume she paid the parents for letting her into the brothel and for allowing her to spend time with their kids, because it sure seemed like the parents didn't want her there.  She gives the kids cameras and decides to teach them photography.  Honestly, they're in a caste system, will these kids really become photographers some day or will they end up selling the cameras for food as soon as she goes away?

The film shows the film maker working hard and becoming frustrated when she tries to put the children in good schools and meets difficulties in doing so.  She does end up getting them in schools but I couldn't help feeling that she was pushing the kids and pushing the parents to do it for her own purposes--which was making this documentary.  In reality, the schools would never have accepted the kids, but when they have a camera sticking in their faces, I guess it was hard for them to say no.  I can also only imagine how guilty and ashamed the parents must have felt when a strange foreigner shows up and makes them feel like they're not doing what's best for their kids.  The parents are poor.  They work in brothels because it's the only job they CAN do, not because they want to do it.  I'm sure they would put their kids in good schools if they weren't too busy trying to survive first.

Now I know this might touch a nerve in some people, but it is reality.  The children in the families know that their mothers are prostitutes and they accept it.  The young girls also know that someday it will be their jobs too.  They even call it ""joining the line.""  As an American I don't think that's fair or acceptable...for Americans.  But in India they see things differently.  It's the only way to survive in the caste system.

The ending was no surprise.  Out of all the children she put in school, except for like two kids, most returned home or were pulled out by their parents to work at home.  And all along I think most viewers knew it was going to end up this way.  We don't get the parents' perspectives or reasons for their choices though so of course viewers are thinking how terrible the parents are for doing this.  I found it to be a little too ""one-sided"" like I was being forced to think of the situation from one point of view, rather than by getting the whole picture.

Another thing that bothered me is that the woman didn't even have the respect to bother to learn their language.  She spoke through an interpreter the whole time.  Yet, there was a part in the film where she was trying to teach the children English.

I also wondered about the person who translated the film into English.  There was one part where two families were fighting.  Now I know that every language has curse words or taboo words in it.  What I didn't know is that these words could be translated into ""d--k"", ""c--t"", f--king"", ""b---h"", ""slut"" and ""whore"".  I suspect the English translation came out the way the film maker wanted it to by purposely choosing these words as the translations.

This film is intended to be an American ""feel-good"" movie.  People watch it and think it's so wonderful that this American woman tried to make a difference in these poor people's lives.  Then we feel good about ourselves for feeling pity on them.  Meanwhile, we feel proud of OUR system for not being like theirs.  It's easy to judge from where we're standing.  Personally, I think it's sickening and it's more of a bad reflection on our culture rather than theirs.",1128384000,35,5012,4.5390625

2354515,1,B000A2XCBC,"Somehow, some people know two incompatible emotions such as pity and self-gratification can actually work together for the masses.  All you need is not a well thought out script.  Skip plot, dialogues and talented actors.  Just drop a video camera in any of the poverty-stricken parts of the world--and there are thousands of such parts--and voila, you have people feeling 'touched' and experiencing an inexplicable mix of guilt and pleasure. (Remember to bring along some fancy toys from the industrialized world, though.  The locals will be so excited they will let you roll the film.)

So a British photographer drops herself in the redlight district of Calcutta, gives out cameras that the children would have otherwise never gotten a chance to play with, and is hailed like a goddess, a hero from the west who tries to save the children from the ignorant, violent and uncivilized savages.  We are all supposed to feel very moved.  We good, they bad.  The problem is, the children may have never felt ashamed of themselves or their parents until she showed up.  Now they do.

The caste system has existed in India for thousands of years--by their own choice.  It is easy for someone from the west to go over for a period of time, drop some judgment on those people, and then return to her comfortable home and tell her friends 'I tried to save those children.  Sigh.'  It never occurs to her that the children cannot go to school because their poor parents need them to do chores; that their parents want out but are trapped by circumstances; that 'born into brothels' is the result of the cycle of poverty.  She, without even the ability to speak their language, thinks she can arrive, wave her magic wand and make all the problems go away.

People like Barbara Bush think Katrina did the 'underpriviledged people' a favor.  Oh, they're doing better than before.  We may not be as rich as Barbara, but at least now we have poor Indians to condescend to.  It would be interesting if some super rich people decide to make a Poverty Reality Show on an American middle class person.  Put one of us on a yacht and let him feel what it's like to be able to not deal with overbearing bosses every day.  Sail around the Caribean, do nothing, drink the finest champagne for a month. Make him feel ashamed of his own mundane existence.  Then show the film to other rich folk so they can feel 'touched' ('wow, I didn't know life sucked for a middle class guy') while feeling good about themselves at the same time.",1127952000,17,2508,4.64172335600907
2354516,5,B000A2XCBC,"FIRST: Save yourself a lot of aggravation and just turn on the sub-titles.  It's not rocket science.  When a film is not primarily in English, and it is nominated for an Oscar or wins one, it's a very good bet that there are sub-titles.  It's one thing the `menu' button is used for.  And, here is a helpful hint: in films which are in English and there is some non-English dialogue sometimes if you turn on sub-titles you can read a translation.  The same thing holds for non-English songs which are playing in the background, or which play a central part in a film; turn on the sub-titles and often you will be able to read the translation.  Nifty trick.

SECOND: Think of this movie as a trilogy: the movie comes first, followed by the movie with the film-makers voice over commentary, and finally watching the children watching the movie.  I found that while the movie was good, watching it as a trilogy brings clarity and motive and result into sharp, poignant, focus.

THEN: Sit back and enjoy one of the finest movies I have ever seen.  Maybe top ten, maybe top 100, but one of those movies that I will remember the rest of my life.  The film-makers are astonishing in their ability to remain in the background and allow the children to take the stage.  This film is simply about what a group of children have done with a lot of Kodak film.  There are many strings which flow through this film, and many implied strings in the background - all of which take a back-seat to the talent that these children exhibit.  A good film has a multitude of levels, some conscious decisions of the film-makers and editors, some completely unconscious, and some which exist only within the individual watching the film.  This film has all that and more.

 I found that I wasn't aware of how complex the film was until I watched the film with the film-makers narrative. It's not the often mindless banter of people trying to fill space or time, it's a very keen insight on the film-makers themselves, the subtleties of the children, and the environment within which they all lived.  I  found that it was more revealing than the film itself, and I saw the Light of Pure Love and Selfless Giving within the film-makers which wasn't obvious to me on the first watching of the film.  It gives the film even more power.  As both Kauffman and Briski mention in their narratives, finding  a way to edit the film to show the astonishing growth of some tremendously talented children over the background of their environment was difficult.  Their solution was to simply weave the entire evolution into a documentary focused upon the art produced by the children and that lead directly and inevitably to the personal involvement of the film-makers in the personal lives and destiny of the children.

As Briski mentions, the children are now self-supporting photographers. What is not said is that she could easily take a percentage of their income for her services as their `agent', but she believes that 100% of what they earn must go toward their education.  Just because a person wins an Oscar doesn't mean they are rich, live a comfortable life, or have `arrived'.

An equally important part of the DVD is watching the children watch the movie.  This is done through a horizontally split-screen, the children on the left, the film on the right, and the sub-titles across the bottom.  The reaction of the children is a perfect culmination to the film.

I don't believe that I have ever read a review where the reviewer says that the movie should not be taken as a stand alone piece of art, but should be seen in a larger context which a single edit just cannot contain.  However, I feel that this is the case with this movie.  I would have found it a good movie, and even been able to say that it would have stayed with me for the rest of my life, but when I think of it as a trilogy it elevates it to one of the best movies I have seen thus far in my life.  I doubt that it will ever drop off of my `must see, great movie' list.  I started this movie in the late evening, something to watch before falling asleep - and  it was so compelling I watched it into the early morning hours of the next day.

Sometimes five-stars are too easy to give.  This film is one of those ephemeral standards by which to judge other films.  I wish I could give this  film six-stars to compensate for all the other five-stars I have given and recommended over my life.",1127865600,9,4435,4.504380475594493

2354529,4,B000A2XCBC,"There are some good and bad points to this documentary which will reflect many of the divisions within American society and these will ultimately determine who views this project as good not bad.

The synopsis appearing in Amazon pretty much covers the story and, as others have done within their reviews, this leaves no justification for it's further inclusion here.

One of the blurbs on the box talks about the good qualities of the movie. Certainly there is a strong message of hope here that one can escape poverty, squalor and all the rest of it through education and training. No-one can argue with the basic premise that poverty is bad and that everyone in poverty would benefit from an increase in their material income and prosperity.

On the plus side, the film documents the development of the individual children through their education while establishing the background in the environment of the brothels of Calcutta. This certainly generates much sympathy for the children and engenders hope and joy for their futures. The work of their benefactors is largely rewarded by their acclaim of the success which is achieved by their proteges.

On the down side, the film exposes much of the attitudes of residents of Western industrialised economies towards those of poorer nations. Not surprisingly, in the wake of the debacle of Hurricane Katrina, the DVD release at this time points out some of the double standards of our own country by lifting this lid. The basic propositions are that working in the sex trade is bad, that women are exploited from a very young age, that the lack of educational opportunities hampers the improvement in the lives of women, that poverty is a scourge which shows no signs of being eradicated and that third world men maintain women in states of dependency from which there is no escape. Understandably these propositions are inculcated in many western minds as exhibited in the outcry which resulted from remarks made by the Pakistani President Musharaff yesterday about women getting raped to become millionaires in western nations.

As always the world is a much more complex place and the truth is not always what is seen. Prostitution is not regarded as the world's oldest profession for nothing and there is no evidence to suggest that it does not exist in the west, nor that young children are not forced into it. The distribution of wealth is uneven in the world but in general, the standard of living for most non-African nations is considerably higher than it was one hundred years ago. Rising income levels in India and China are benefitting more workers but the spread of higher paying jobs is relatively slow. Before anyone should suggest that I am a blatant apologist for the status quo please be assured that I am not. My point is that these things still exist in the west despite our higher overall wealth and income. Also the benefactors of the children in the film helped only a few, so what sort of message does that send to the rest of the developing world? Our views of this sort of movie suggest that the answer to these problems is to make the people more like us. Except that we continue to have problems which are different and often revolve having too much and not too little.

Americans are the most generous people on this planet. You only have to look and see what has been done to help the victims of the hurricane to tell that. Despite that we still have problems of illiteracy, teenage pregnancies and poverty. We still have slums and, despite universal free education, we have not cured these problems. Certainly we have not ended prostitution. So yes we should applaud this excellent documentary but before we pat ourselves too much on our backs in self-congratulation, we should remember that we have similar problems of a different nature and scale but we do not have any obvious benefactors to come along and help some of our most unfortunate and vulnerable.

A great movie which ought to generate more light and heat than it has done so far.",1126828800,11,4025,4.807803468208093
2354530,5,B000A2XCBC,"Why is it that these days all the best movies are documentaries? Born Into Brothels is yet another great documentary that was better than most major Hollywood releases in 2004. Best of all, the movie isn't the gloom fest the subject matter suggests it would be, and the film ends with a glimmer of hope - yes, the world can be changed for the better, at least in small amounts. Zana Briski rocks - she deserves all the respect in the world.

Futhermore, the photos these kids take are amazing, especially the ones by the little chubby dude. That kid is a straight up genius and it is amazing watching his talent unfold in front of your eyes. And all of the kids were so cute. Watching them play at the beach was just too much.",1126483200,2,726,4.338235294117647
2354531,1,B000A2XCBC,"I was born in Calcutta right across the street from Mother Theresa's Mission of Charity headquarters.  I also saw ""Born into Brothels"" when it opened in NY.

Yaaaawwwwwn!

It might have been an impressive movie had the director not have appeared to be condescending and self-righteous.

""Sonar Gachi"" translated, means Golden Tree, is a decades old ""red light district"" frequented by thousands or men in the state of West Bengal, and the city of Calcutta.

Ms. Briski's attempt at ""saving"" those children from the ""squalor"" portrayed in her documentary came across as offensive since she viewed their lives as ""hopeless"".  They are fine and have been for as long as I can remember. Another offensive thing about this whole movie is that she befriended the mothers over a period of two years, and exploited the kids' curiosity...which obviously played on the guilt so omnipresent in the Western hemisphere.

Her portrayal of the ""doomed"" kids in Calcutta's brothels is ONE Westerner's perspective of ""How sad, you're so poor or a prostitute. How can you be happy?""  Children in Calcutta have been doing quite nicely for themselves without being forced into institutions deemed necessary by Ms. Briski or the West at large.  How can one NOT expect more children to be born into brothels, when the REAL problem is Johns pay more for sex without a condom to increase the sensation - not to mention risk STDs?

If an ignorant documentary maker were to pull a fish out of the water because she felt it was drowning, some good it would do the fish! Eventually, as the documentary showed, her experiment flopped because all but one of the kids went back to where they knew home was - with their mothers, regardless of what profession they had!

Ms. Briski's good intention does surface fleetingly, however, had she not been in almost every frame beating her chest like a martyr, I might not have questioned her intentions.

After all, Mother Theresa did not make a movie of the plight of Calcutta's poor - she simply gave everything she had to those less fortunate.  I know, I saw her almost daily and if there ever was a God, I've already met her.",1125964800,42,2140,4.782608695652174
2354532,5,B000A2XCBC,"Part way through this BRILLIANT documentary, 8 kids

get identification pictures taken. The shots are frontal,

cropped like typical yearbook and passport photos, and

in each picture the kid is smiling. The pictures are stapled

to application forms for boading schools, and they

are about as misrepresentational of  the kids as imaginable,

because we know by now that they are the children of

prostitutes, and living in a world that one describes as

having no word for "" hope. ""

It seems like every possibility for a camera's

elucidation of a subject is used here - exquisitely

The children are thoroughly scruntized by the the film's

directors,  and by each other through the cameras that

each one of them receives - and then we complete the

loop by watching the documentary. There are MOTION pictures,

FREEZE frames, SLOW motion, and STILL photographs,

and the lot of them is so intimately and sensitively

assembled, edited, and backed with complimenting

music, that I would dare you to reach the final shot and

not feel as if you had just seen one of the great films

of the past ten years. The movie concludes with freeze

frames of the eight kids, one after another, and what's

happened to them - despite of or because of all the

attention they have received - it's heart breaking.

SEE THIS FILM.",1125964800,3,1321,4.76

I only showed clips to my students, but they 1.) immediately noticed all the layers in each scene; and 2.) really liked the documentary itself.  Although it's not one I would watch over and over again on my own, I'll probably show a little more in class next year, and it's definitely a keeper.",1508716800,,371,4.522388059701493
8073423,5,B000A2XCBC,"This documentary is a beautiful and painful look at the lives of the children of women who are prostituted in Calcutta and involved in other illegal industries around the red light district. In the fall of 2016 I spent three months working with children who were trafficked or abused in Nepal. I saw my children in the children in ""Born into Brothels."" This documentary highlights that these children are children. It is easy to label them and make them statistics and forget that they are children. But they are also children who are growing up in a red light district, forced to recognize that they might follow their mothers into sex work, not have food to eat tomorrow, or simply never leave this area (the biggest desire of many of the children). The filmmaker, Zana Briski, beautiful guides you through their lives as she teaches them photography and strives to improve their futures. I love the focus on their photography. The children are featured as students and as photographers in their own right. It is so empowering. This is a sad story, but it is also inspiring and sheds light on the potential that anyone has when given opportunities. Unfortunately, not all of these children are able to take the opportunities that are presented to them, but the filmmaker's efforts to help them beautifully cross through the line of objectivity. ""Born into Brothels"" is an important film because it forces the viewer to see these far away children as people and to realize that when we reach out to one another, we can make a difference, even if it is only temporary.",1488067200,2,1568,4.768382352941177

8073426,5,B000A2XCBC,"I feel in love with this movie after watching it. There's a complex story that is told, but I believe the best of it is that when given an opportunity, outcast children can thrive. The kids being documented are both street smart and intelligent, but there are hindered by the obstacles put in their way due to the stigma that surrounds them.

There are many issues that are featured in this movie and not nearly enough solutions. but as the critical reviews state it is uplifting to see children find joy through the lens of a camera.",1471478400,,534,4.505154639175258
