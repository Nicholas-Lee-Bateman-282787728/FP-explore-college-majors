8296789,1,B001E6FEUU,Wasn't what I thought.  Oh well.  Pretty boring.,1445558400,,48,4.875
8296790,5,B001E6FEUU,"David Conover produced this Coastal Dawns blu-ray. He is also the producer of the Sunrise Earth Discovery series. These episodes featuring stunning fall foilage of Camden, Maine and beautiful footage of a Maui sunrise are very similar to Sunrise Earth episodes. Amazing photography. Stunning vistas that make you wish you there. I hope Compass Light makes more of these.",1374969600,2,370,5.288135593220339
8296791,2,B001E6FEUU,I understand that these are not supposed to be action packed however this disc takes it to the next level. I was looking for something similar to sunrise earth to watch while listening to music on the exercise bike and I think I've watched this twice.,1346803200,,251,4.478260869565218
8296792,5,B001E6FEUU,"Fans of Sunrise Earth already know this, but David Conover's hi-def videos are what he calls ""experiential HDTV"" and his first in the ""BlueMarvel"" series is fantastic.  I'd call it video shot as if you were there...long-duration shots just like you'd see if you were standing in that spot on the coast of Maine or Hawaii. It's like the best vacation video you could never shoot because you don't own a 50-thousand dollar HD camera.  Live sound only - no music, no talking and best of all - no titles, if you choose (there are also two options for text overlays).  Amidst the noise of the city, I like to just put on the noise-cancelling headphones, relax and let ""Coastal Dawns"" take me there.",1299369600,5,693,4.57258064516129
8296793,2,B001E6FEUU,"I was disappointed with the locations and production quality on this DVD - especially for the hefty price. I also found it quite boring. The other reviews build it up quite a bit and although the footage does look nice, it is definitely NOT any better than any of the BBC documentaries like Planet Earth or Ganges. I bought this to show off the capabilities of my new Plasma Kuro, but I think the BBC documentaries are far superior in terms of production, cinematography and quality.",1234915200,,483,4.627906976744186
8296794,5,B001E6FEUU,"I have to say that this one is a winner! I just found out 'Coastal Dawns' was made by the same producers who made 'Sunrise Earth', definitely one of my favorites series! Why travel, when you can bring this slice of the natural world into the comfort of your own living room.",1230422400,,274,4.288461538461538
8296795,5,B001E6FEUU,"I currently have a simple 720p 2 channel HD system.  This is very relaxing to watch or have playing in the background.  I don't get tired of either the video or audio.

Much like the best travel videos, you get to enjoy the best of a location anytime.

In terms of music, I like Drums and Bass through Ultra Chill.  This is the equiv. of Ultra Chill -- seemingly not much happens at any one time; yet while it takes its time to unfold, it is rewarding to experience.

I would urge readers to discard the label 'consumer' that the marketeers have placed upon you.  Instead, think of yourself as a patron -- encouraging and supporting the production of what you like.

I like this disc; I look forward to future releases.",1230249600,2,719,4.393939393939394
8296796,5,B001E6FEUU,"This is as good an experience of HD nature viewing as I've ever seen. BlueMarvel is to be congratulated on introducing a new genre of programming that allows the viewer to see natural imagery at nature's pace with stunning beauty.""
