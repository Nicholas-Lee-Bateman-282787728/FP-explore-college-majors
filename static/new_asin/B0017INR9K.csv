8410103,5,B0017INR9K,"Excellent! Just excellent! Unless you have a time machine and travel back to the 1950's and you love Groucho you need this. The set comes in cardboard but safely which is good for our environment. The set includes 2 disc's and some extra's like cool commercials for DeSoto cars at a price that is awesome-2 grand for a gas guzzler. All said this is a look at the times of the 50's & early 1960's when McCarthyism was tearing our nation apart and Groucho should have been a write in Candidate for the 1952 Presidential Race and he may have put a stop to the Dictatorship that was called ""The House Un-American Activities Committee (It sounds incorrect but that is what the Committee was called, look it up and please correct me if I have made a mistake). We still have to watch our backs but at least we can laugh, well, some of us.",1439424000,,831,4.367741935483871
