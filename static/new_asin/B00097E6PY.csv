It's too short, though, and the plot wasn't developed as fully as it could have been, but it was still enjoyable.  Nice to see a clean Christian film, with a great message.  The 70's music was neat, too.",1515283200,,296,4.327272727272727

and it would  be good for teens and parents to watch this one.",1510444800,,198,4.184210526315789
8057890,3,B00097E6PY,This movie presents itself with the question of how does a new christian deal with the pressure of associating with friends he had before becoming turning their life over to Christ.  Unfortunately most teens will yield to the peer pressure and soon find their way back into old habits.  This movie brings to the front the parable of the sower and the seeds that fell on fertile ground.  Through perseverance and faith one triumphs in trying times. So despite some cheesy acting and trite script this movie delivers an important message.,1508630400,,536,4.868131868131868

8057892,5,B00097E6PY,"This was a very nice movie about a boy who becomes a christian and brings along with him the entire school. it just goes to show you that when you stand firm, the devil cant move you.
this was sweet and kind. the only thing i didn't like about it was his carnal girlfriend in which he had no business with . but eventually, the Lord showed him to stay away from her. that part was good. Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.
worth your time :)",1305676800,3,455,4.066666666666666
