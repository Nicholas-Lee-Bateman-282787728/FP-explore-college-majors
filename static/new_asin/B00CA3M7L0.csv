5708698,4,B00CA3M7L0,Good Family movie and if you like horses you will find this enjoyable. The movie had a good story line.,1376870400,,103,4.2
5708699,5,B00CA3M7L0,"This totally enjoyable movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was well written and acted. Unlike many low budget family movies, the characters and plot were believable and touching. There wasn't one cuss word and no sex. The daughter had a cheerful personality, the fearlessness of strong convictions, while the Dad was quiet, but kind with strong convictions. The ranch hand who became the daughter's boy friend had admirable character qualities and a most charming personality. The shows main characters were all really likable. Of course there was the bad guy, but while certainly unlikable, his part was also believably well done. The Mom was her daughter's best friend. How often do you see this in the movies? Also if you are into horses, you will love this movie. It should come as no surprise that I highly recommend this well done family movie.",1374883200,16,867,4.825503355704698
5708700,4,B00CA3M7L0,"Ricky Schroder and his family put together a really decent Hallmark tale about family, love and horses.

Teenaged and determined, Malibu girl Willow(Cambrie Schroder- daughter of Ricky) wants to meet the father she never knew.  He's(Ricky Schroder) a cowboy whose ranch is in trouble.  There's conflict and hurt between the two, and their obvious different lifestyles.  They find a point of common interest in a wild mustang.

Surprisingly well shot and acted with beautiful country scenery and lots of horse action, the story's quite emotionally tinted at times, but still delivers a fine tale for the whole family, although little kids might get bored with the drama.

Produced, directed, written and starred in by Ricky, wife and family, his real daughter, in her introducing role, Cambrie, does a marvellous job as the teen in turmoil.

There's country humor thrown in, some mild peril(rated PG), and a bit too conveniently sweet ending tying it all together.  It definitely could sell as a pilot for a series or a sequel.  Overall, for the family drama genre, it's very well done.",1373673600,9,1085,5.050561797752809

5708725,1,B00CA3M7L0,Extremely unrealistic storyline. Portrays the rancher father as not knowing anything while his Malibu-raised daughter of course knows the right way to tame a horse. Absolutely no sense of dignity is portrayed in either the father or the mother. The definition of freedom at the end of the movie is false. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone! Especially not to impressionable young children who would learn from this movie that kids always know better than their parents. Please heed my warning and don't waste your time watching this movie!,1427414400,2,547,5.021978021978022

A cowboy on a dude ranch that her mother had a summer fling with 15 years ago.  She travels to the, now a working ranch, and meets her stunned father who had no idea he had a daughter.  In a final ditch effort to save the ranch her Dad catches a wild stallion named Bravo to sell, but she falls instantly in love with the horse and believes it must be set free.  Ricky Schroder plays the dad and his real life daughter Cambrie Schroder plays the girl.  Good movie for young girls.

5708739,1,B00CA3M7L0,"This is what you get when an L.A. Person writes a horse movie. Unreliable storyline, poorly written and terribly unrealistic. It gives people unrealistic expectations about horses. As someone who's been around horses their entire life, this movie is dangerous for anyone who looks at it and expects real life to be like that or tries to apply ANYTHING seen in this movie to horses. The dramatic plot was poorly written and thought out. It's a wholesome family movie but it's just terrible trying to get through. Wasted $2.99 to rent it.",1402185600,2,536,4.836956521739131

5708747,1,B00CA3M7L0,"Not a family movie in my opinion. There was bad language. The whole premise of the movie was a teenage girl getting pregnant, not telling the guy, raising the daughter by herself, & only telling her daughter who her dad was when she was a teen. Same tired story line that's in every horse movie  (girl loves horse, girl saves horse...arrgh), plus with sappy dialogue, sprinkled with not so great acting. The only redeeming part was that Cambrie Shroder seems to have an innocence about her that was really refreshing for a Hollywood actress.",1384732800,3,541,4.75531914893617
5708748,3,B00CA3M7L0,"Yay, nepotism! Normally, I frown on those whose names require four consonants before the vowel finally shows up, but bless the Schroders, they're obviously a close-knit fam. And a ""family that likes to do things together"" sounds ever so much kinder than ""favoritism granted in business regardless of merit."" Hallmark's 2013 family programming, Our Wild Hearts, is obviously very much a labor of love for the Schroders. It's intended primarily to showcase Rick's daughter, Cambrie, but Rick's wife, Andrea, co-writes and - produces and their sons, Luke and Holden, have supporting roles. And not that I remember seeing her in the film but rumor has it that Rick's younger daughter, Faith, has a cameo as well.

Rick Schroder wears all the hats here. He co-writes, co-produces, directs, and acts here. He plays Jack, a weathered cowboy who is on the verge of losing his ranch in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The last thing he needed was a visit from Willow Johnson (Cambrie Schroder), a 15-year-old girl claiming to be his daughter.

Cambrie Schroder has got skills. She does a fine job of transitioning from callow Malibu diva to earnest teen with a cause. Willow and Jack's first moments together are deliberately awkward, but they do find commonality with their shared love of horses. Their shared love of horses is also what causes a major rift between them. Jack catches wild horses for a living. He breaks them in - some say he ""gentles"" these horses - and sells them for ""adoption."" His ongoing project is to bring in a majestic, wild stallion he's named Bravo. His chief rival, the slimy Grizz (Martin Kove), means to nab Bravo first. Willow herself is an expert horsewoman (horsegirl?) and she's instantly smitten with Bravo.

The core conflict concerns Willow's belief that Bravo should be allowed to remain free to roam the wilds. Jack's belief is that he's arse-broke and desperately requires capital. It also doesn't help the sitch that Jack, even though he's only known his sudden daughter for three days, is so overprotective. He warns Willow to stay away from the captured and very dangerous Bravo. She protests that the horse would never hurt her. His rebuttal: ""Everything a horse does can be traced back to instincts, food, or shelter - not trying to please a human being.""

Man, it's a long ways away from Silver Spoons (Erin Gray, a.k.a. Colonel Wilma Deering, I'm still crushing on you). Rick Schroder is finally, finally showing his age (Dick Clark was starting to worry). Still, it's jarring to hear one of the characters so dismissively refer to Schroder as ""old man."" When I saw his name (everywhere) on the opening credits, I couldn't pass up watching this movie. And he's okay as the laconic (I don't want to say ""stiff"") cowboy dad. I don't know that I buy him as a horse-breaker. Cambrie is the one to watch, and, undoubtedly, that's very much in accord with her dad's plan. She turns in a spirited performance. She seems a natural.

Our Wild Hearts is a coming-of-age story and it's family friendly. And I hate to rain on the feelgoodness of it all, but there were some not so good bits. Maybe my biggest gripe is that things fall in place too easily. The shifts in relationship come abruptly. It'd be different if the story took place over the span of several weeks, instead of mere days. I'm also not keen on how Martin Kove's character is painted as such a cartoony big bad. So, for me, there were bits that just didn't ring true.

It's weird, but my favorite moment is when Willow can't find cell phone reception in Jack's ranch and has to use an old school rotary phone. I grinned at how so excited she got when she finally figured out how to dial the thing. Incidentally, how did her mom (Angela Lindvall) instantly know it was her when she picked up on the other end? Man, I should've included this in the prior paragraph when I was listing my gripes. Anyway, for all its flaws, I still recommend this film, especially if you're a Ricky Schroder fan or if you want to see new talent on the horizon. And for trivia buffs, it's pretty neat that Jack's ranch is actually the set that was used to shoot some little television series called Little House on the Prairie. That's cool, right?",1382313600,3,4220,4.711382113821138

8578987,1,B00CA3M7L0,"Awful.  Disclaimer:  I am not an overly critical person and even confess that I don't mind if a movie is a little cheesy.  That being said, the acting is laughable/horrific; the best actor is the horse.  The plot is rushed, extremely predictable and completely not believable.  Example, a 15 year old girl finds out who her father is and her mother (a woman depicted as a great mother) allows her to go off by herself, show up on his doorstep and stay with him for an indefinite period of time.  The father takes her at her word that she is his offspring and they proceed to eat dinner and have a heart to heart.  This all takes a total of 5 minutes of screen time.  I guess I thought Ricky Schroeder was an actor in good standing but have been proven firmly otherwise unless this was just a whacked out of body experience for him.",1497225600,,831,4.316129032258065

8578992,1,B00CA3M7L0,"First of all, let me say that nobody loves Ricky Schroder more than I do. I have seen most, if not all of his shows and movies. This is the only movie I just couldn't stomach to finish watching. I just didn't care how it ended, though it was so predictable the whole way through that I know how it did. It was unusually shallow even for a Hallmark movie. Nobody sends their 15 year old daughter by herself with a suitcase to meet a man her mother hasn't seen in 15 years, especially without calling, then goes straight to bed once she gets there. Little things like that made me cringe. Ricky is a fabulous actor, but his kids do not have acting talent, and it took away from the movie.  He even used his own dog, but the dog did well. I think the dog should have had more scenes, maybe that would have helped. I was hoping this would have been a good movie, but just too shallow for me. I needed a little depth to enjoy it.",1481414400,,924,4.104972375690608
