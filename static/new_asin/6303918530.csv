728960,4,6303918530,"Wonder Years was one of the most captivating and favorite shows I've followed in the 90's. Watching re-runs on TV can bring that sense of nostalgia because the show was that impactful. It doesn't necessarily have to appeal to hardcore fans. The show contains mild comedy and that 'coming-of-age' style story that makes it one of the best dramas in 90's TV.

The show chronicles the life of Kevin Arnold, a caucasian middle-class adolecent growing up on the well titled wonder years or the 60's. Basically, he gives us his anecdote about growing up in those years and how he as an adolecent overcame most of life's obstacles - something many teens face. The best thing about the show was that it contained some situations that many teens faced in life - here we see how to overcome it and the hilarity and familiarity of it. It's also about love, family and high school. The show's fame mirrored onto shows such as Dilbert, Hey Arnold and The Simpsons - where the narrator Daniel Stern voiced Bart's adventures as he assumed the role of Kevin Arnold.

The show has a strong premise. We all have experienced love, loss, fights, authroity, being grounded and ambition. The Wonder Years started out a bit shaky but eventually gained fame after showing with perfection how a normal adolecent hurdle life's obstacles while living through the 60's. The show is very recommenable. If the DVD set ever comes out, you should purchase it then.",1144800000,5,1432,4.770161290322581
728961,5,6303918530,"I must take issue with My-Linh Pham who writes ""As a devoted fan of the Wonder Years, I must say that I was disappointed in this video collection. Not only is the quality poor (fading in and out, scratchiness, etc.) but there are only two episodes per video (on this one and on vol. 1)"" Perhaps Ms Pham is not quite as devoted a fan as she claims. Might I remind her that the quality of any video featuring Fred Savage can never be poor and, while I can appreciate her sentiments that more episodes = more Fred Savage, two episodes of the Wonder Years featuring Fred Savages remarkable and moving portrayal of Kevin are still excellent and worthy of rather more than two stars!
For shame!",1132012800,7,688,4.425196850393701
728962,2,6303918530,"As a devoted fan of the Wonder Years, I must say that I was disappointed in this video collection.  Not only is the quality poor (fading in and out, scratchiness, etc.) but there are only two episodes per video (on this one and on vol. 1).  I appreciate the early episodes, but they definitely made a mistake by passing up some of the gems of the later seasons (""The Lake""/cara episode, ""Goodbye"", anything with Becky Slater...and of course, the 2-part series finale).  Unless you're desperate and this is truly your only option, I would recommend holding out until something better comes along.",1073347200,22,595,4.813725490196078
728963,4,6303918530,"The episodes on this video both really make you think. Not only are they both amusing, they also capture your heart. ""My Father's Office""  is a father-son episode, in which Kevin goes to work with his father and  uncovers a few mysteries of the life of his father. He learns a few reasons  why his father is the way he is. ""Angel"" is a funnier episode  than the first, but it still manages to have a moral at the end and make  you think. In it Karen, Kevin's older sister, has a new boyfriend, that  Kevin discovers is cheating on her and Kevin tries to find ways to get rid  of him. So if you're a Wonder Years fan, I reccommend you add this great  video to your collection!",965952000,7,675,4.178294573643411
729092,4,6303918530,"Great show. Great acting. Season 4, episode 7?, the Thanksgiving episode made me cry. So poignant! Sometimes I wish the parents had kicked Kevin's older brother's rear for being such a complete behind...but I guess that would have over simplified the show, if everyone had behaved perfectly!",1387238400,,291,5.212765957446808
729093,5,6303918530,awesome series loved it because the characters were great and the show reminded me a lot of when i grew up also a lot of the issues were relevant to discuss with my 11 year old neice who is entering junior high next year  it ended when it needed to and didn't stay on and get crappy it was a great series that dealt with the issues adolescents face in junior high and high school and had some of the history of my childhood,1386806400,,423,4.035714285714286
729094,5,6303918530,"By far, one of the very best shows to ever hit television. I feel very connected to Kevin Arnold, having grown up at the same time while sharing many similar family issues and nurturing friendships and relationships.",1386374400,,216,4.864864864864865
729095,5,6303918530,Might be one of my favorite shows ever! The only minor downfall is that due to certain copyright issues some of the original music is not featured in the shows allotted for viewing. This has been a problem with other shows but is particular to The Wonder Years which is why it has never been released on DVD,1378944000,,307,4.310344827586207
729096,5,6303918530,"Just a wonderful show, I remember when the show was on TV and it was a funny show to watch with a great family value attached to it.",1378684800,,132,3.75
729097,5,6303918530,"This is my all time favorite show! Excellent family show seen thru the eyes of an American boy growing up. Tv shows have been replaced with reality shows, so watch some classic tv!",1378339200,,180,4.484848484848484
729098,4,6303918530,"Watching the Wonder Years on Prime is excellent. The show is still as classy as the day it was made.  The sad part though is the music.  The intro is a cover of Joe Cocker's original ""Little Help from My Friends"".  Without Joe's vocals leading the show's intro, same of the nostalgia that riddles the series for me is lost.  The other scene where I clearly noticed the lack of original music was the episode ""How I spent My Summer Vacation"".  After Winnie kisses Kevin, Kevin gets ready for the party to the tune of the Doors ""Light My Fire"", a classic that so well captured the fun nature of Kevin's new found confidence and attitude towards his relationship with Winnie and once again fills the mind with nostalgia.  It has now been replaced with some random song that has a few similar notes to sadly mimic the original Doors' song but ends up falling very short.  I understand that to get the music rights for all of those songs for the DVD or Amazon Prime ""syndication"" is expensive and difficult.  But from an observational stand point, it has a negative effect on the series.  As they say, there's nothing like the original hence the 4/5 stars.",1378080000,,1151,4.521739130434782

729100,5,6303918530,"The Wonder Years was one of my favorite shows of all time, and Coda is far and away my favorite episode. There's always a poignancy woven into the humor, making it more than a generic sitcom.",1377388800,,191,4.333333333333333
729101,5,6303918530,"The continuing saga of Kevin, Winnie, and Paul...the best middle school show ever! The Wonder Years Season Two does not disappoint. Be sure to watch ""Loosiers"" (Ep. 9).",1376352000,,168,5.035714285714286
729220,4,6303918530,The Wonder Years is or was such a great show because of its growing pains and what it means to grow up from childhood to adult.  I love the narration of it.,1376092800,,156,3.875
729221,5,6303918530,I used to watch the wonder years when it first came on and then I watched reruns and I never get tired of it. The television shows today (especially reality shows) are not worth my time. Some shows border on pornography. The Wonder Years sticks pretty close to how it was back then.,1376006400,,282,4.339622641509434

729436,5,6303918530,"I grew up watching shows like the wonder years.  In this time where reality tv is so popular, it's great to know that my family can stream this show. I sit down with my 3sons and watch a couple of episodes each night.  They are currently Kevin Arnold's age, and I'm sure they can relate to his ordeals.  I know I did at that age growing up with this show. Anyways, this brings back great memories and each show has a moral or lesson that my kids can learn from.  Highly recommended. Sure miss shows like this.",1363219200,,509,4.216494845360825
729437,5,6303918530,"I was a teenager when Wonder Years aired on TV, and I remember watching each episode with my family, and discussing the situations that were so familiar and reflective of real life. I have loved this show since then. In my opinion, this is one of those rare shows that has withstood the test of time, the characters, Kevin, Paul, Winnie Cooper, and the Arnold family were all reminders of parts of ourselves and the situations were so true to real-life, and always, an element of humor and poignancy ran through each episode, made all the more unforgettable by the great music evocative of the era it was set in.

I am so glad that Amazon has made this excellent TV series available for instant streaming. Prime members get to watch the episodes as free downloads. The streaming quality is good and I love the convenience, though I am still hopeful that someday this stellar show will be made available on DVD.",1362096000,,910,4.617283950617284

Physical education class was just like the one shown with my favorite memories of the fire alarm drill going off while we were showering and commando basketball, where you wore a boxing glove on one hand and there were no fouls called because you could hit the guy with the ball.  The girlfriend issue where the girl's friend asks you if you like her friend and the awkward dancing.  The boring science teacher was a hoot.  The time period occurred about 5 years after me, but the kids look like Junior High kids and the way the girls dressed was right on the money(something I miss with how high school girls dress these days.)
