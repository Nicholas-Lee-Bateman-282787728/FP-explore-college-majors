4530798,3,B0052SO0H4,"Tori Spelling stars in this thriller about a naive college student who falls for a charming psychopath. When Billy Owens (Ivan Sergei) murders his former high school sweetheart so that no one else will ever have her, he assumes a new identity as a college co-ed to cover the trail.",1391040000,,281,4.64
4530799,5,B0052SO0H4,"I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD THAT AFTER WATCHING IT THE FIRST TIME YOU JUST WANT TO WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS FILM IS ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING UNTIL HE GETS WHAT HE WANTS; AND I DO MEAN ANYTHING. THE GUY PLAYED BY IVAN SERGEI IS SO SICK AND TWISTED THAT HE IS MENTALLY DERANGED. ONCE HE STARTS DATING LAUREL( TORI SPELLINGS CHARACTER) HE TREATS HER LIKE A POSSESSION, AND NOT A PERSON. THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD THAT YOU LOVE HER, BUT YOU HATE HIM SO MUCH THAT DURING THE ENTIRE MOVIE YOU WANT TO KILL HIM, BUT NEVER DO. SEE IT!",1388102400,2,574,4.043859649122807

4530803,2,B0052SO0H4,"In my opinion, this film doesn't reach the ""so bad it's good"" level
that Plan 9 from Outer Space does. In reference to an earlier reviewer:
anybody who says Tori Spelling CAN act is nuts. ""You'll find yourself
laughing at the absurd, over-the-top acting of all characters involved.
Tori Spelling's bad acting is to be expected, but it's an extra
terrible masterpiece in Mother, May I Sleep with Danger. Her canoe
paddling scene will have you in stitches as you watch her struggle to
use the paddles. Ivan Sergei is laughable as the crazy boyfriend with a
penchant for danger. Her mother (you know, the one she's asking if it's
okay to sleep with danger) is awkward and annoying."" Though planned to
be released in theaters, it couldn't find a distributor willing to show
it and had to be shown on TV. That should tell you something.",1335657600,,831,4.659863945578231
4530804,3,B0052SO0H4,"With a title like that and a star like Tori Spelling, you already have some idea what you're in for.  Never mind the fact that it's an alleged ""Lifetime cult classic,"" whatever that means.  This movie is over the top and unintentionally funny.  Ivan Sergei plays Billy Jones, and he's just a boy who can't take no for an answer no matter how many times he hears it.  What does he do?  He kills the first blond bobbed girl and buries her, Donnie Osmond hair and all.  Two years later he has reinvented himself with the Harry Connick, Jr. look as a pre-med student, having stolen another boy's identity, Kevin Shane, whom he also makes disappear.  Gosh, but he's just such a magician, it's amazing his name wasn't David Copperfield!  This time around he chases a naive Laurel, played by a red-haired Tori Spelling, and she looks ten times better with it that color.  Oh, well, he convinces her to chop it off in a blond bob (oo-wee-oo!), then slowly begins to alienate her from friends and her mother.  He is possessive, domineering, and virtually imprisons her with his smothering ways, not entirely unlike a large percentage of males out there, except he's worse.  He says stupid, corny, creepy things, making the viewer feel a) they were better off watching Saw or b) maybe Rocky's Horrible Picture Show wasn't so bad after all.

*****SPOILER ALERT*****

Okay, so you just knew in the ""epic climax"" that Tori would save the day with a boat oar before Billy-Kevin-Prescott-Tickle Me Elmo-Whatever kills her mommy, and you just knew he didn't drown.  Oh, gee, we did NOT see this coming, because Lifetime hasn't trampled this unsacred ground of a theme to death or anything.  Ivan Sergei sure is nice looking, but he can't act, and this is a typical role where Tori by any other name is still Tori.  The ending is quite hilarious, because he's picked up another bobbed blond, this time his name is Prescott (Yuch!), and now he's running around with hair that is eerily similar to the young Colin Blunstone.

*****END OF SPOILER*****

This movie is so bad it's a laugh a minute, but the strange thing is that it's hard to turn off for the unintended entertainment value.  I say get it on that basis.  After all, being stalked really is no laughing matter, but this movie sure is.  Buy it on the cheap, though.  All in all, it's pretty fun.",1318118400,10,2337,4.621359223300971
4530805,5,B0052SO0H4,"Probably one of Tori's most famous women-in-peril movies, you'll love this film from begining to end. A cult classic that everyone should see. Out of all of the tv movies made, this one is the most memorable. Great flick. 5 out of 5 stars for sure.",1308528000,5,248,4.413043478260869
4530806,5,B0052SO0H4,"So bad it's good?  That about sums it up.  Constantly on rotation on the Lifetime Movie Network, released September of 1996, if you love cheesy movies of the week from the 90's, and want to relive the obsession with mid-90s college guys in Kurt Cobain flannels stalking tender ronis, then this is the movie (movie, *barely can keep composure*) for you!  I only gave it 5 stars because Lifetime brands it as a cult classic...you may *need* to join a cult (yes Xenu, I'm channeling you!) to erase it from your memory.  Confused by my passive-aggressive review?  BUY IT!!!!",1308528000,7,570,4.717171717171717

4530810,5,B0052SO0H4,"I'm a huge fan of terrible lifetime movies and was really impressed with this remake, because it was ridiculous, and therefore amazing.
Spoiler Alert: instead of a crazy abusive boyfriend, we have a cursed lesbian vampire girlfriend! Tori is of course, awesome, and James Franco is a genius.

So terrible I can't recommend it enough. If you like movies like ""The F.P"", or bad lifetime movies are a guilty pleasure for you, you will love this.",1483056000,7,442,4.815789473684211

I bought this movie because I loved the first ""Mother May I Sleep with Danger"" I thought it would be as good as the first one, especially considering it has Tory Spelling in it.

4530834,3,B0052SO0H4,"I had high expectations and they were not met. James Franco's role was overbilled. Tori's was just right, and she was very good. I enjoyed the special effects that preceded the arrival of the night walkers. My only real complaint is that it all moved too slowly, so I was pretty much bored out of my skull.",1475280000,,306,4.385964912280702

4530836,4,B0052SO0H4,"The reviews of Mother, May I Sleep with Danger are generally confusing. They conflate two different movies, one made in 1998, and one released in 2016. The later movie has been advertised as a remake of the earlier movie, a completely misleading characterization. The two movies actually have almost nothing in common except their names and the involvement of Tori Spelling.

The 1998 movie aims at being a psychological thriller. Its about a college student who unwittingly starts dating a sociopath. The students mother realizes there is something off about the young man, but cant put her finger on the problem.

This more recent movie that Im reviewing is about a college student who startles her mother when she brings a woman home as her love interest. The mother seems to have had no idea about her daughters lesbian orientation. But the mother doesnt suspect the hidden side of her daughters lover, a side which is not ultimately evil at all.

As viewers learn almost immediately, this dark, but not necessarily depraved side to her daughters friend is that she is a vampire. While she and her cohorts are sanguine about enlisting the unsuspecting daughter into their ranks, there is sometimes a positive crusading aspect to their predations.

While I was at first very disappointed at having gotten what I considered the wrong movie by this title  I found it was something I could get my teeth into after all. Much of it is just soft core porn, an excuse to show girl-on-girl action - not something that would ordinarily interest me. But this was filmed in such a stylish, visually arresting way, I got drawn into its sensuous world of nightwalkers. The colors are lurid, saturated. While the vampires aren't shown flying, many scenes are introduced by scanning aerial shots that give viewers the feeling of being a bat on the wing.

The women are vampy; the violence is campy. If you're into the genre, youll probably find this to be a toothy morsel of a movie.",1475020800,,1971,4.816568047337278

4530840,5,B0052SO0H4,First off -I have no idea what movie the idiot Carlisle Wheeling viewed and gave 3 star negative feedback but it sure as hell ain't the same movie everyone else viewed.  He must be a serious scorned hater.  Tori must have kicked the being to the curve and he's trying to ruin her masterpiece. Stay away and do not believe his comments.  They have nothing to do with this movie. Obvious to see he's on PCP.  This movie is Surprisingly Delicious with a girl twist that will make you want to run yet somehow you remain to play.  I was hooked within the first five minutes and that's exactly what it takes to get my horror mood on and this movie not only delivers it's delivers by being so simply and goriffic all in one.  Tori Spelling has found her calling in Directing films. As Co-Director she hit this one out of the ball park. A must see for all fans of the horror GENRE.  The next generation of The Lost Boys. CULT Classic if there ever was.,1474588800,,944,4.269662921348314
4530841,3,B0052SO0H4,"I am being so generous here. The cast as a whole is pretty good especially Ivan Sergei and the psychopathic boyfriend. I have always liked him in all of his movies and most, if not all are small indie movies. The mom and all the rest of the cast are pretty good too. The story is pretty good too. Girl meets boy who keeps her away from all her friends and family because he wants her all to herself. My problems are these, how stupid is the girl that she doesn't get it! But okay let us suspend that belief. The big problem....Tori Spelling, dear God in heaven but she is AWFUL. I will never understand why anyone put her in any movie they were doing. Somebody must have gotten paid off.",1472688000,,687,4.212121212121212

4530855,5,B0052SO0H4,"This is the best movie ever to watch when you're deliriously ill. The ludicrous plot twists make sense when you're in the throes of a Herxheimer reaction. In fact, the movie is so improved by it that it's just not as fun to watch when you're feeling well. This is a TV movie (that was originally intended to be a theatrical release!) based on a suspense novel of the same name. Ivan Sergei, who is very easy on the eyes even when playing a needy psycho, stars as Billy/Kevin, a guy who gets really extreme when his girlfriends decide they want to explore other interests such as visiting the ladies room by themselves. Then he has to go murder some guy and steal his identity and it's a whole wearying thing. Tori Spelling is memorable as innocent Laurel, who somehow doesn't cotton on to the fact that there's something weird about Kevin until after she's alone with him up at her family's isolated lake house. Then it's up to Laurel's mom Jessica to save the day. Because it just is. That part made more sense during the fever.

I feel compelled to edit this review to add that I originally wrote and posted it on the 90's version of the movie. Not quite sure how it wound up here, but now that I know this version exists, I do intend to see it. Have to wait for a sick day though.",1406419200,2,1283,4.323651452282157
