1784962,1,B00006L91I,"Really bad. There is nothing in this movie that's credible. It's not just the overall story, it's every scene. I don't believe any of it. If anyone thinks Linda Fiorentino can act, this will set them straight. She plays a biche by being a biche all the time, she doesn't even have a fake nice girl routine to rope in the sucker. You can only leave so many bodies in your wake before someone starts to suspect that you're the bad guy-girl. Bill Pullman is only onscreen for a few scenes, but when he is, you see what a good actor can do with lousy material.",1488153600,,556,4.254716981132075

1784974,5,B00006L91I,"I saw a lot of Film noir-famme fatal movies before and I can tell that this director must have seen hundreds of them. This is not an ordinary film noir at all. From <Kiss Me deadly> to <Lost Highway> there are so many movies out there about woman seducing man to kill her husband to be free from the husband cause she stole money from him and want to live a free life. She eventually wants to get rid of the guy that she seduced also.
Sounds like a typical to you, ha? No, not at all. This one is so clever and so fast phased that you will feel like watching a wonderland.
Linda Florentino was so amazing that you cannot hate her at all. She is sexy, clever, city smelly a prude but sometimes promiscuous unpredictable, if money involved she can do anything type of woman. We say her from the movie like <MAN IN BLACK> and horrible film like <JADE>. But she was never famous. What a shame.
The director mostly directed TV dramas and he finally made this one time masterpiece and I am so glad that I accidantally had a chance to watch this.
If you see this film, you will feel how cleverly the script had been written and each episode has been connected from one scene to another later.
Every moments were not wasted at all.
Also charactor development are so great.
Linda, I don't even need to mention her, Bill Pullman is beyond his normal act, he is a poor guy and he knows that he was F** and he acted as such, Peter Burg is a naive nice guy who is a one track minded if he falls in love with one woman he goes with her all the way and we can see by his face instantly. I cannot think of other cast.
These three main actors are so perfectly chosen and that made this movie shined.
The Jazz music made the mood of the movie stickier combined with rain.
If you are or even are not a fan of noir films you will truely enjoy this film.
Try to find this film from any site since it is a rare film to find.
You won't feel regret.

Cold, aggressively sexual, brilliantly manipulative, calculating as a grandmaster in a chess match, Fiorentino's character is amazingly, creatively evil.

Viewers may not notice that the soundtrack references Fats Waller's ""Everybody Wants My Baby.""  The song lyric continues, ""But My Baby Don't Want Nobody But Me."" When you see this excellent movie, the lyric will make perfect sense.

Last Seduction is a remarkable movie: funny, cruel, smart, and barbed with condensed surprises. After watching, I felt the tragedy as well. All that intelligence, calculation, expense of energy....for what? All for a tragic goal, although a tragic goal is not the same as a tragic ending. Poet W. S.

1785047,5,B00006L91I,"When they created the term `Femme Fatale', they created it for characters like Bridget Gregory and for performances like Linda Fiorentino's.  Seriously, this film is ALL ABOUT LINDA, and she delivers a tour-de-force that is one of the finest performances of the 90's, period.  With a `take no prisoners' attitude and a strut that is sure to bring every man to his knees, Fiorentino doesn't pull any punches and instead creates one of the most memorable onscreen vixens I've ever had the pleasure of watching.

The film follows Bridget as she steals a ton of money from her husband after she pressures him into going into a drug deal with some drug dealers.  She then flees New York for Beston and hooks up with a nave young man looking for a reason to feel better than he is and she winds up using him, first for pleasure and then eventually manipulating him into a murder plot against her husband, all the while keeping her new lover in the dark as to her true intentions.

Thank god no one copped out with that killer finale!

Fiorentino eats up every ounce of screentime here, delivering an iconic portrayal of a manipulative, destructive and selfish woman.  She is pure evil, but the kind you can't help but salivate over.  Bill Pullman delivers his best performance, at least that I've seen, and Peter Berg is effectively capture by Fiorentino's seductive ways.  The plot twists towards the end (revealed secrets) are strangely enticing and keep the film interesting and the wrap us is just pitch perfect.

Not for the faint of heart, but certainly a worthwhile ride.",1375833600,,1572,4.7463235294117645

No commentary track, no choices of audio format, no subtitles in any language, not even so much as a theatrical trailer.  As much fun as this movie is - and it's a lot of fun - the disc almost isn't worth the bother, because it's impossible to watch it and not be constantly reminded of what a poor job Artisan's done in presenting it.

1785076,4,B00006L91I,"The Last Seduction (1994) is remarkably  stylish, with an
intellectually mature story, heavily rooted in reality, even 15
years later.

Linda Fiorentino plays a Machevellian 30-ish woman, having the
looks of a younger lady, with a classic beauty, very feminine
and seductive in a number of different scenarios, but who uses
precisely that attribute to her advantage in manipulating men,
some of whom are weaker than others to her notable presence.

She starts out as a manager in a boiler room, overseeing high
pressure sales reps pushing commemorative coins, but quickly
sets her ambitions much higher, to bigger dollar amounts, in
conjunction with her husband, played here by Bill Pullman, (who
holds his own in terms of street smarts.)

She double crosses Pullman's character, wanting all of the loot
for herself from a joint  narcotics sale that went off.

Peter Berg plays a simple-minded, small town man of the same
age, who is torn between his righteous upbringing, strong
natural sense of morality, that is jeopardized by the behavior
of Fiorentino's character. The latter demonstrating a megacity,
hyper-competitive, largely-experienced, jaded, cerebral, cynical
state of mind, in this particular case, of Brooklyn, with
profits at any price, dog-eat-dog and  so on. She combine those
talents with her capacity to inflame Berg with her femininity
spontaneously.

The visual aspects work well, for this particular movie, as a
classic style is exhibited by Fiorentino's character time and
again, such as by her gold watch, classic but provocative
clothes, with a few naked shots to boot, of both Berg and
herself, emphasizing the over-extended libido felt by both
characters, at the same time as one their devious plans.

The criminal tendencies of Fiorentino's character are
demonstrated at the same time as her lack of rigor in her own
personal conduct: throwing off her wedding ring, spitting
chewing gum on the street, licking a dollar bill, using a men's
washroom (not the women's), spontaneously having relations
anywhere (outside a club, in a car, on her office desk), using
profanity, reaching for private parts, spitting out her food,
extinguishing a cigarette on  a pie, etc.) The character is also
shown as having no notion of ethics, or of the policy of
confidentiality touching upon client lists of her employer, as
she dreams up ways of making millions off life insurance
policies she will manipulate.

From the above discussion, the movie is a success story in terms
of style, with a tiny bit of voyeurism, for those appreciating
the actress' classic beauty (looks, clothes, etc.) and apparent
down to earth present, yet sophistication, as compared to what
is the norm in the media.

While not a wide-screen release, the filming is spotless, the
music accompaniment is rooted in jazz, the story extremely well
articulated, and relevant to today. There are no subtitles.",1242432000,,2891,5.193548387096774

Even worse than her is the ending of the film, which I won't divulge here. Also the DVD needs a better transfer and it needs English subtitles (closed captioning.)

Yet, the movie was very interesting and somewhat involving. Once it starts, it's tough to put down. Peter Berg plays a small-town sap who is captivated by this beast from Hell and pays for it.

This is about as tough as modern-day film noir gets, a mean-edged flick with no sympathetic characters.....but it can be fascinating to watch, wondering what this woman is going to do next.",1236556800,,814,4.884057971014493

1785089,4,B00006L91I,"The Last Seduction (John Dahl, 1994)

That John Dahl's made-for-cable flick The Last Seduction ever got a theatrical release-- after its cable debut-- is pretty remarkable. That it subsequently wound up on any list of the thousand-best films ever made is astonishing. That it ended up on four of the ten lists of this type of whose existence I am currently aware is the stuff of Hollywood legend.

It's about Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino, recently of Liberty Stands Still), a nasty sort who first ruins her husband's life, then heads off into the sunset, landing by chance in the tiny town of Beston, New York. In Beston, she hopes to lay low until her divorce is final, but two things prevent that from happening. One is that her husband would like the $700,000 she stole from him back, and hires a private investigator (Bill Nunn, from the Spider-Man franchise) to track her down. The other is her own nature; she can't exist somewhere without conning someone. So she gets involved with a local guy, Mike Swale (Smokin' Aces' Peter Berg), using the insurance company they both work for to look for women who might be better off with their husbands six feet underground.

I have to say that five minutes into this, I didn't think I was going to like it. The opening is far too slow-paced and talky, especially for a scene that exists simply to set up the main conflict in the movie. It could've been done in half the time. Once the movie actually gets going, though, it's a great deal of fun. Fiorentino owns this character; it's widely believe that, had the movie not shown on HBO before getting a theatrical release, Fiorentino would have nabbed an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.  And while it takes some time for all the pieces of the plot to get set up, once it starts rolling, it's got momentum to spare. (Fans of The Usual Suspects will recognize the plot structure here, I'm sure.) I still don't think it's Dahl's best work-- Rounders is pretty tough to beat-- but it's certainly much better than its initial lack of distribution would convey. ***",1206403200,,2064,4.677685950413223

Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice and Kathleen Turner in Body Heat might come close, but first prize belongs to Linda for her performance as Bridget Gregory in The Last Seduction.  Bridget is a woman with a warm exterior that has ice water running through her veins, who believes in manipulating others into doing her dirty work for her.

1785092,5,B00006L91I,"Perhaps I love this movie so much simply beacuse I just now happened upon it. I hadn't heard of it, and now I see that it came out in 2002. Wow, where was I?

This is one twisted chick in one twisted film. The thing that obviously attracts us to the female character is her beauty, and brains. No one could be this evil and still have men chasing her without ""something."" And the ""something"" is that she's sexy as can be--a real knock-out.

The scene in the bar where she checks out Berg's equipment under the table can't be beat. A sort of outdoing of ""Sally Met Harry"" for 2002. Berg plays it cool, and the great ""secret"" of his life is finally revealed toward the end of the movie.

Linda Florentino is pretty with clothes on or off, one of those tall slim Hollywood gals with augmented lips.  She talks tough and dirty, outdoing her men toys in the saddle, so if the viewer wants some steamy stuff, okay, ya got it.  The problem: the plot is unbelievable.  A good thriller, take Body Heat for example, gives you the steamy romance and a plot device that doesn't intrude.  If the mechanics of the swindle are forced, well, we have only Florentino's next hot scene to look forward too.

Weirdly, Bill Pullman, the smarmy medical student turned pill pusher, Fiorentino's hubby, shines up the plot, keeping it ""real"" when he is on the screen, which is not often.  A little humor goes a long way in a tragedy.  Just ask William Shakespeare.",1167264000,,956,4.888198757763975

1785097,5,B00006L91I,"I've just watched ""The Last Seduction"" for the first time, and I have to admit the film languished in my ""Cart--Save For Later"" for ages before I finally pushed it up into the checkout section. I hesitated for two reasons. One was the reviews which frequently mentioned ""plot holes."" Do reviewers just suspect there are plot holes, then feel compelled to make the accusation without any firm evidence to back it up? I have seen a couple of reviews for other films where plot holes are specifically addressed, but it's very rare. There may be plot holes in ""The Last Seduction,"" but I didn't notice them. And when Fiorentino's character (Bridget) burns a piece of evidence at the film's end, it certainly makes a case that the writers were not slack with the details. The other point that made me hesitate was the full screen treatment, and claims of a poor quality film transfer. I'm a widescreen viewer, but please do not let this full screen treatment discourage you. As for the quality of the film, it's a bit grainy, but I felt that actually gave the movie more of a gritty ""film noir"" look. There may have been two or three fleeting artifacts, but I've seen as many on many films praised for their image quality. I didn't notice any compression problems at all, and the sound quality was consistently good. So, if you're hesitating, as I was, let me nudge you to the checkout counter. This is an excellent movie. Linda Fiorentino is deliciously evil; the storyline is solid and compelling. Make space on your DVD shelf for this one!",1142640000,,1537,4.654411764705882

It is pretty unusual to have such a strong female character, it was entertaining to see a woman as tough as nails and unflinching. The male characters were considerably less developed. You are bludgeoned with the ""men will do anything for sex"" message - so what if that clich happens to be true. The slight parallels to Double Indemnity are fun, but Linda Fiorentino would mop up the floor with Barbara Stanwyck. This is a stripped down, bare bones DVD. The sound is simple stereo, not that is matters because this is not an action flick.",1122508800,,624,4.580357142857143
1785110,3,B00006L91I,"The femme fatale was a staple of 1940s film noir: an unusually attractive and downright coldhearted woman who knows how to get what she wants by using her own femininity and sexuality to lure unsuspecting men into her trap. She's often the smartest character in the film, able to play everyone else like a piano, and do anything it takes for power and money. The Last Seduction recalls this great archetype and gives us a femme fatale so evil that it's just a joy to watch her operate.

Linda Fiorentino plays the woman in question, Bridget Gregory, who right off the bat steals $700,000 from her husband, Clay (Bill Pullman), who got that money from illegally selling drugs that was able to acquire as a doctor. Bridget hightails it out of New York City and ends up hiding out in a town called Beston in upstate New York, where she plans to live under an assumed name, Wendy Kroy, until things cool down and she can return to New York.

It is in Beston that she meets her patsy, a local man seeking love and affection named Mike (Peter Berg), who falls hard for ""Wendy"" when he meets her in a bar. Bridget uses Mike for sex, but he constantly tries to pry into her personal life, which she will have no part of. She scares him a bit when she starts talking about killing bad men for money, and when he will not relent with his quest for personal details, she pushes back on him about his secret from when he lived in Buffalo. Despite all of this, Mike cannot resist her charms, but we get the feeling that something bad is going to go down when Clay finally catches up with Bridget--that is, unless she can get to him first.

The Last Seduction was directed by John Dahl, and originally played on cable TV after being passed over by distributors. After it proved to be a great success, the film then received a theatrical release--quite an unusual scenario. At any rate, this is a very good film with some excellent characters. Bridget is the kind of character that you love to hate, because she manages to manipulate situations so well, and even though she's diabolical, you have to give her credit, because she's damn smart and she knows exactly what she's doing.

However, I make a judgment on recommending a film based on whether I would add the movie to my DVD collection, and with this film, I didn't feel any special desire to do so. It's clever, but it's not overwhelming clever. It's thrilling in parts, but I wasn't on the edge of my seat. It's funny sometimes, but my chuckles never escalated to a guffaw. And while it makes the viewer think while watching it, afterwards there isn't much reflection to be done. But if you're looking to be entertained for a couple of hours, you could do a lot worse than The Last Seduction.",1114560000,,2736,4.4769539078156315
1785111,5,B00006L91I,"John Dahl's ""The Last Seduction"" captures the flavor of film noir perfectly. Bridgett (Linda Fiorentino)seems to have it all; she's beautiful, bright but married to a dead end job and a dead beat wannabe doctor Clay (Bill Pullman). Clay's pulled the ultimate drug deal; he's illegally purchased medications with cocaine in them and sold them to drug dealers on the street. To do this he borrowed $100,000 from a loan shark. With the profits, he plans on living in high style with his wife. Bridget has other plans. After a fight, she steals the money with the intention of keeping it all for herself. She disappears in a small town hoping to hold on to the money until her attorney (J. T. Walsh)can complete her divorce. Changing her name, she takes a job at an insurance company. She meets Mike Swale (Peter Berg)in a local bar. He's infatuated with her from the moment he meets her. ""Wendy"" as she's now called has plans for him and her ex that will allow her to keep all the money for herself.

A direct descendant of ""Double Indemnity"" (Bridget gives her name as ""Mrs. Neff"" at one point a tip of the hat to the classic movie and book)and other noir thrillers, ""The Last Seduction"" got dumped on cable but when the distributor realized it had such a great movie they released it to theaters. Widely lauded for her role, Linda Fiorentino could have scored an Oscar nomination--if not for the fact that HBO showed this before it was released to theaters. Bill Pullman turns in a twisted performance as Clay playing with the audience expectations created by his appearence in other movies as the good guy. He gives a great performance. There's hardly a weak performance in the film and Dahl's direction is so sure handed you'd imagine this was his tenth or twentieth film not one of his first. The late great J.T. Walsh brings the oily lawyer Frank Griffith to life in a great supporting turn.

That was the good news. The bad is that this great movie has been given a basic DVD presentation and, what's worse, it doesn't look all that great. There's a number of compression artifacts. While this states that it's in the original format, it looks to me like the image was blown up from a widescreen presentation as the image looks lousy. There's no extras at all. That's too bad as this film (like ""Red Rock West"") deserves a commentary track from Dahl as its one of his most accomplished films. At the very least, we should have gotten a documentary on the film and why it got dumped on cable and how the film was discovered by filmgoers.

5 Stars for the movie, 2 stars for the lousy presentation by Artisan (and the lousy transfer). It's unfortunate that Lion's Gate (which distributes this) chose not to provide the package and picture quality this film deserved.",1107820800,,2768,4.621951219512195
1785112,3,B00006L91I,"Linda Fiorentino stars as the ultimate bad girl in this little thriller directed by John Dahl; Bill Pullman, JT Walsh, and Peter Berg round out the strong cast.  The plot revolves around some money that Clay(Pullman), a doctor selling drugs illegally, has just made a deal for and brought home to his wife, Bridget(Fiorentino).  After getting into a fight in which Clay slaps Bridget, she takes off with the money.  She procedes to some small upstate town where she decides to try to hide out for a while and see what Clay knows about her whereabouts.  After talking to a lawyer friend(Walsh), she weighs her options and decides to set up shop temporarily and get a job in an insurance company.  While not exactly fitting into Smalltown, USA, she nonetheless finds herself being pursued by an extremely naive local-yokel by the name of Mike Swale(Berg).  The two hook up for some steamy no-strings-attached sex until Mike confesses that he loves her.  Bridget decides she has him in the palm of her hand and launches into a plot to rid herself of him, her husband, and anything else that stands in the way of that large sum of illegal money.

I thought the film started off well enough, but as the plot developed I found myself having a few problems with the film.  First off, the Bridget character is so completely unlikable and just downright nasty that I found myself really hating her right from the opening frames of the film, which is a problem if you are basing the whole film around her.  I'm all for the femme fatale thing, but I find it more effective when the woman is more cunning, subtlely seducing the unsuspecting male victim--and viewer-- into a false sense of security and then hitting you over the head with a I-didn't-see-that-coming plot twist.  Bridget is hardly subtle.  In fact, she doesn't use trickery to get her male victims to do what she wants, she just asks them to do stupid things and they willingly oblige.  One scene in particular that really irked me is when Bridget is tracked down by this seemingly buisness-like black private eye hired by her husband.  He points a gun at her and tells her to drive.  She then asks him if the thing about black guys having a big, you know, is true and then asks him to whip it out so she can see for herself.  He says no at first and then decides to do it if she'll shut up.  That was the point in the story where I said what the...?  I thought that scene was so ridiculous.  Later on there is another scene that equals or surpasses that scene in the-men-behaving-stupidly theme.

I really liked Dahl's work in Red Rock West, so I felt somewhat let down by this film.  A few times I thought he took shortcuts to get a particular scene to work instead of putting some more thought into it.  The film does move at a strong pace and features some very good performances, but some of the problems I mentioned earlier left me disappointed.  Overall, The Last Seduction was worth the rental, but defintely won't be on my buy list.",1103328000,,2994,4.534450651769087

I just liked watching her connive, manipulate and dominate her way to succcess. As a woman, I wondered if many men would like this film, since Fiorentino is intensely intimidating and female without being conventionally feminine. So far, I've found that younger men seem to like the movie while many older men don't like it. Most of the women I know, including Mom, like it. I think that's because we get a charge out of the oddity of seeing a woman of such power and certainty -- even though she uses those strengths for evil.

Directed by John Dahl and written by Steve Baranci, this 1994 film begins with Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino) lording it over an office of telemarketers trying to sell collectible coins.  Meanwhile, her husband Clay (Bill Pullman) has pulled his first drug deal and netted $700,000.  However, as they talk about celebrating he makes the mistake of slapping her and by the time he gets out of the shower she has disappeared with the money.  Of course, by the end of the movie when he are thinking that Clay made a mistake marrying Bridget in the first place.  Bridget calls up her lawyer (J.T. Walsh) to find out what her options are preserving stolen money as a marital asset when she gets a divorce while Clay hires a private eye (Bill Nunn) to find her and get his money back because he has a loan shark who is not happy with him.
The obvious historical antecedent for ""The Last Seduction"" is ""Double Indemnity,"" and when Bridget takes the name Wendy Kroy (look at it backwards) and starts working for an insurance company it is hard not to notice the similarities (that and she calls herself Mrs. Neff at one point).  However, before that happens she hooks up with Mike Swale (Peter Berg) at a bar and is less than thrilled to see that he works there two.  They continue to meet at the bar for sex and he keeps trying to get closer, but she is still on the run and needs to come up with a way of saving her life and the keeping the money (not necessarily in that order).
""The Last Seduction"" begins trying to lull you into thinking this is a romantic comedy (my wife kept saying ""You said this was a thriller, this is not the music of a thriller""), but then things take a more serious turn.  Once that happens the twists and turns just keep coming as Linda Fiorentino makes Barbara Stanwyck's Phyllis Dietrichson look like a prim and proper little schoolgirl.  Unfortunately, ""The Last Seduction"" was shown on television before its theatrical release, which put the kibosh on any hopes of Fiorentino getting an Oscar nomination.  Yes, the character is that memorable, as good at being bad as anyone you can recall and she never, ever lets the mask slip away as this mistress of improvisation takes care of everyone and everything in her own sweet way.
There are no extras of any kind on this DVD, which actually is a good thing.  That is because this is the sort of film that should really stand on its own without a look behind the curtain and it makes perfect sense that there are not any deleted scenes.

1785143,5,B00006L91I,"I can't say enough about this film.
It is my favorite.  It such a favorite film that when I came to new Yok and didn't have a ""drink"" when going to bars, I ordered a Manhattan like Bridgitte and to this day I still drink it.
What make sthsi film so good to me is one, she's smart and two she doesn't pull back.  It would've been easy to have her chicken out and go good girl at the end.  But Bridgitte has her eyes on teh prize from beginning to end.  Whether you consider her the Devil or a tarnished angel she doesn't stop.
Also she thinks.
Its so wonderful to see someone sit down and have to figure out a problem, to have to plot a manipulation, to leap at opportunities that may mean nothing and MAKE them mean something.
I like the fact that she plays every card in teh deck: sex, homophobia, lust, race, anything it takes to in a sense stay alive.
Now this may seem liek a throughly evil person but there points in this film where Bridgitte does ""crack"" or try to really be herself.  There's teh one where Mike asks who she is, what she's doing and she tries to explain to him abotu her husband and the money while playing pool.  He doesn't take her seriously.  For two reasons, he doesn't think she's that smart or capable and he can't fathom himself doin git either.  One thing I'v elearned is that the smarter you see yourself.  The more capable you feel about yourself the easier it is to understand others even if their goals and methods are opposed to your own.  It takes smarts to see smarts.
There's also the point where Bridgitte has been forced to fake the accident with the private investigator. Before she leaves and is caught, she tries to have Mike comfort her, to really listen to her.  But two things have happned.  She's playe dtehgame so well that her sincerity comes across as false and two, he doesn't want someone without secrets.  Who doesn't have the upper hand.  Some people are drawn to being destroyed by others because it validates their existence.  If someone would take the time to destroy you it means that you exist, that you have meaning.  But Bridgitte does crack here, she's ready to fess up and be with Mike as an equal and he blows her off to play hockey.  Her voice even cracks and in some ways we can see how Bridgitte is the way she is because no one is a race horse like she is.  That she is tougher because the disappointment of others has made her tough to begin with.  That honest emotion I can relate to and it's why I like Bridgitte.  If she was just uncaringly evil, she'd be no fun but you understand why Bridgitte is the way she is if you look at when she lets her defenses down.
Above ll else she is teh concummate chess player, understanding that the game is never to the pieces your playing with but to destroying the other side.  Being cut off from runnign because of her husband's debts and her desire NOT to run has boxed her in into not so much fighting in the way that men or women perceive fighting btu teh way thinkers do.  A thinker knows that everythign and everybody is a weapon or a defense in a fight.  That each word is a calculation, that each action should mean or be about something and seeing that ability on screen is what makes thsi film on my top 3 favorite films of my entire life.

this is exactly why ""the last seduction"" is so successful a film. the script couldve been written by a slightly precocious and masochistic high school kid. if you wrote down the dialogue and read it back silently you'd swear you'd just transcribed some godforsaken hbo b-movie. well, you would have. even hbo gets lucky occassionally. in this case, they ought to have thanked the cinematic gods for linda fiorentino. she not only rescues ""the last seduction"" from complete imbecility - she elevates it to a ""near-masterpiece of the neo-noir spider-woman canon"", as roger ebert might (and probably did) say. remember barbra stanwyck in ""double indemnity""? you won't after you see this. in fact there is really no comparison in film. bridget (aka ""wendy"") describes herself - while slamming her fists against the roof of her jeep astride her boyfriend - in terms that i can't employ on amazon, but it rhymes with ""trucking witch"", and nobody is going to disagree with her.  she is capable of anything and everything up-to-and-including murder, on a whim, for convenience's sake, without the slightest hint of remorse, and she's thoroughly capable of getting away with it. her single human emotion is greed. since her greed is focused on conventional ends - sex, money, power - we can all relate; what's shocking is the utter ultimacy of her greed, and her uncanny ability to exploit her situation, however doubtful it seems, using the most vile and heartless methods conceivable, and come out smelling like a rose. of course, that's where the plot strains our imagination; but the burden is on the actor. if she fails to radiate an aura diabolical enough to convince us of her complete mastery of her environment, we'll notice the fact that the plot is illogically propped up on all sides to support her, and the whole spell of the movie will be broken. needless to say, that's not a problem here. our first glimpse of bridget finds her barking orders at a sweatshop full of telemarketing scammers as they hawk ""commemorative coins"" at dumb old ladies in jersey. prowling around like a dominatrix, taunting them with a stack of bills, she is totally convincing in her power; she's a being to be reckoned with not because of anything you know about her - nothing yet - but because of her presence, one of authority and emotional detachment with a bias towards menace. later she plays with a guy who hits on her in a bar (quite literally), decides to have sex with him on a whim purely for pleasure, just as a man would do; and then when he, taking the traditionally ""female"" role in response, extends himself to her emotionally, she exploits his gullability in sundry creative ways, ultimately convincing him to kill for her as part of an insurance scam. now that's classic noir. he's even characterized as a small-town country boy, and she swoops in on him from the big bad city and destroys him, in a recapitulation of a classic motif from the original 40's films noir - the metropolis as eroder of ethics and values and the patriarchal order. as bridget snarls at one point:""spare me your brainless countrified morality!"" you've just got to see her in action. fiorentino's performance is a flawless gem in a meagre setting, but that's enough - that's what makes a movie.",1017014400,,3967,4.874074074074074
1785173,2,B00006L91I,"The whole business of the smart woman who knows how to use sex to make men stupid just doesn't really wash for me. BODY HEAT, BASIC INSTINCT, ROMEO IS BLEEDING, and this one. Each plays in its own way on the idea that estrogen makes women smart while testosterone makes men stupid enough to override their survival instinct.
I dunno...maybe this is true for a lot of guys, but it ain't true for me. I don't find myself huffing and puffing at the sultry sexuality that these women bring to the screen.
That said, this was one of the better examples of that genre that I've seen--an incredible performance from Linda Fiorentino (whom I've had an eye on since VISION QUEST--why isn't this woman a star?), a cutting script, appropriately moody direction, editing and cinematography...this should have been a perfect movie. Maybe it's a perfect specimen of this sort of movie and my own dislike for the genre is what keeps me from seeing that.
All I know is that when the story came to its shock ending...nothing. No resolution for me...no sense of justice...no horror at the turn of events. It just didn't play true for me because, while I've seen (and experienced) many of the stupid things that men have done for sex, I really don't believe that an erection could make a man--even a slow-witted one--THAT stupid.",1015804800,,1310,4.7

1785175,5,B00006L91I,"One of the all-time GREAT '90s neo-noir films, I completely agree with all the other folks here. It is absolutely unbelievable that this title is not available on DVD, especially considering the fact that John Dahl's (the director) other two neo-noirs ARE on DVD--Kill Me Again and Red Rock West, both of which are also excellent.
Unlike Body Heat, in which Lawrence Kasdan (director) formulaically uses film noir elements to tell a tale that grows increasingly more boring and tiresome, Dahl here does a brilliant job of weaving together elements of film noir in a completely fresh, intriguing, and powerful way. Yes, the femme fatale is here, but she's REALLY sexy and REALLY dangerous. And this HAS to be Linda Fiorentino's best performance ever. She is perfect for the part of Wendy, right on target.
Bill Pullman strikes the perfect note as the sleazy, half-whiny, conniving husband and Peter Berg is also perfect as the seemingly not-so-dumb hick from upstate New York--who's ultimately shown to be, in fact, astoundingly dumb in a revelatory scene.

It's bad enough that Linda Fiorentino didn't get an Oscar for her performance in this stylish, black comedy... film noir, but now we cannot even buy it!  For the unititiated, it's plot concerns an unrepentingly manipulative, dupliciticious, backstabbing, double-crossing, oversexed, cold, sarcastic, bullying and wickedly intelligent woman, whom we can only love and admire as we watch her stoop to increasingly amoral steps to outsmart her almost-equal-to-the-par conman/doctor hubbie, all the while dragging a hopelessley struck (as in love and dumb) young, small town hick along for the ride.

In this  clever story, Bridget has decided that her husband (Bill Pullman) is not as  important as the money he received from a drug deal.  She skips town with  the cash only to hook up with the nave Mike (Peter Berg) who will do  anything for her, even murder.  What transpires is too good to be true as  sex and betrayal take center stage.  The actors are outstanding and perfect  for their roles.  Fiorentino is a fireball who gives a ferocious  performance worthy of an Oscar. Lacking any moral values, she lets it be  known that messing with her will lead to trouble.  Director John Dahl keeps  the pace moving and throws in great twists right to the finish.  This is a  very underrated film noir and one that should not be missed.",959299200,,946,4.476470588235294

I  was ready for a story about a murderous BLACK WIDOW femme fatale and she  definitely wasn't it.  Don't get me wrong, she's great.  The plot just  wasn't what I thought.

Her escape leads to a small town in middle America  where she holds up, while trying to talk her hubby into a divorce.  Meanwhile she convinces a local that she has fallen for him and the plot  thickens with strike and counterstrike as husband and wife try to get or  keep the money by any means necessary.

7971520,4,B00006L91I,"This is a movie that is completely over the top. The character Fiorentino plays is as evil a woman as there is. She uses her feminine wiles and hard personality to mesmerize, seduce and destroy her husband and her paramour. I felt sorry for them!

Fiorentino absconds with a $700,000 batch of cash that her husband scored doing a drug deal. He hires an African-American P.I. to track her down but Fiorentino dupes and destroys the hapless fellow by crashing her car and using the local racism to her advantage thus quashing any potential in depth investigation. In the small town of Beston, New York, she seduces a fellow and tricks him into murdering her husband. But the plan goes wrong and the innocent dupe is in the end arrested for murder and rape.

Wow! Roger Ebert said: ""The last Seduction is about the way even a smart guy gets dumb when he starts thinking tumescently."" It's true! It's sad what happened to this man (Played Well By Peter Berg). This lady makes Barbara Stanwyck (Double Indemnity) look like a virgin. even the character from Body Heat is second best compared to the on Linda Fiorentino played. She is absolute evil. she wins in the end and has all the money to herself. However, I wonder if she would ever feel free enough to love another man. I don't think she would. In the end my guess is she would be alone for the rest of her life. but then again, being alone with $700,000 tax free ain't such a bad thing. She'd certainly have her pick of males at her feet and the money would give her the freedom to do almost whatever she wanted.

I give this film Four Stars. It's very good. It tends to drag a bit towards the end (After Bill Nunn's Character Is Slain) but it's still enjoyable. I'm the 104th person to Review this film.
