8124665,5,B000FMBCJ6,"The Sixth Awards of Belly Dance DVD is filled with some wonderful performances. Here are some of my favorites:

Autumn Ward wore a gorgeous Egyptian costume, nicely paced routine, it was easy to pause and repeat or take notes.  She has a lot of feeling in her facial expressions and easy flowing and expressive hands.  Precise and sharp hip movements in her unique drum solo.

Sahra Saeeda performed a Malaya Luff.  Her performances are always beautiful, but this performance was funny and interesting (especially the gum chewing  LOL!).  She is a good actress....her face and especially the eyes were very expressive.  And great hip work too!

Zahra Zuhair put in a wonderful and lyrical Egyptian dance.

Excellent and impressive hip work and routine.  Enjoyed the choreography and her interpretation to the music.  Always has a beautiful smile.

Ya Amar Dance Company  Beautiful and authentic Nubian Choreography.  Colorful costumes.

Jasmine Jahal turned in a beautiful performance in a blue costume.

Love the music and she was well rehearsed with her movements and her choreography.  Her drum solo included great hip movements/shimmies were superior and I enjoyed the accents.

Sese Dance Theater:  SeSe is one great choreographer!  They are so impressive especially since there were 16 dancers in her company!

Jacqueline Eusanio performs a classic cabaret belly dance routine.

Beautiful, flowing purple costume.  Enjoyed hearing finger cymbals along with what sounded like Armenian music. Loved the veil and floor work since it is not done very often any more.

Sharon El Safy is a legend in America.  She performs in a beautifully made and designed brown and mint green dress. Great hip shimmies and smooth and flowing arms and turns. Lots of subtle hip movements and enjoyed her interpretation of the music.

Aziza - A beautiful dancer and a pro in all aspects of the dance.  Never a boring moment, from the graceful and exciting entrance to the drum solo finale which was fast paced and executed with precision hip movements and accents to the drumming of Amir Sofi  (hes so handsome!) I loved the live music at the end of her performance. Aziza and Amir make a great team!

Aziza performs exquisite veil work as she enters the stage.  Good eye contact with the audience and with what she wants you to focus on, i.e., hip accents or shimmies.  Aziza has a beautiful smile and her expressions show that she is enjoying the dance and more importantly enjoying performing for her audience.

Her upper bodywork, particularly her arms and hands are very graceful and always placed in a graceful pose or position.  Great zills too!  Her interpretation of her music lends to very sharp hip movements and accents

that make for an excellent and exciting drum solo.

After watching this performance, I can say that Aziza is now one of my favorite cabaret dancers!

All in all the sixth awards of belly dance is a very entertaining DVD!",1417392000,,2937,4.95482546201232
8124666,4,B000FMBCJ6,"Great DVD.  Has a lot of non-traditional dancers.  Not your typical ""young"" ""sinny"" girls.  Aziza's perfomance at the end is one of the best ever.  However, please know it's very ""Egyptian"" style.  It has no tribal, sword, and so on.",1188604800,,233,4.725
