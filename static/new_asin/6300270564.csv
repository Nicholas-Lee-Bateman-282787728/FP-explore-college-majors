292527,5,6300270564,How come we cannot have films like these now days!!!!  The comedy is good and you can also learn something at the same times.  The 70s was a good time and when they made good comedy films without all of the swearing and volguar!,1124409600,4,228,4.159090909090909

292529,5,6300270564,"Sidney and Bill was a heck of a team. As I was reading the reviews, I wondered if they ever thought to do it again. That would make some folk happy. I remember going to the movies and seeing this when it first came out back in 1977. I remember a young Sheryl Lee Ralph mouthing off and a host of others. Great film.",1097020800,5,315,3.9375
292530,5,6300270564,"I can watch Sidney&Bill all day long period.there films had style,balance&a coolness about them all rolled into one.this film takes the fellows to the Hood to educate&teach students how to get jobs. Denise Nichols is a foxy Lady Yes Lawd! Cosby was grooving on the dance floor in this film.great to see sheryl lee Ralph in this film. I dug the realness&vibe with this film that dealt with all kinds of backgrounds of students.on point commentary as well. Props.",1079827200,7,461,4.848101265822785
292531,5,6300270564,"I LOVED this movie as a young teenager. Cosby and Poitier are forced to mend their ways and do the ""To Sir With Love"" thing with kids in a ghetto. Mighty satisfying scenes that are still worth watching today without being hokey. Love the fadeout where Bill Cosby does ""the bump"" with this heavyset lady that sends him halfway across the room (this scene is surprisingly done in a way that doesn't degrade the lady in question) as they dance to the Staple Singers' title song. But enough of that-SEE IT, and ENJOY!",1075334400,8,513,4.526881720430108
292532,5,6300270564,"This was the last pairing of Cosby and Poitier in 1977 and watching it, you can easily see where Quentin Tarantino and a lot of other young filmmakers get ideas for plotting, pacing and musical backdrops. The most refreshing thing about the film is that it manages to deliver a message about empowering today's youth without beating you over the head with it's preachiness. Brilliantly scored by the late, great Curtis Mayfield and featuring contributions from The Staple Singers, ""A Piece..."" perfectly encapsulates it's time without sinking to the depths of 'Blaxploitation' and buffoonery. The terrific all-star cast includes James Earl Jones, the impossibly gorgeous Denise Nicholas matched only by the lovely Tracy Reed, a very young Sheryl Lee Ralph and the soon- to- be- a- star-via-""What's Happening!"", Ernest Thomas. One scene is of particualar note: one of the youngsters involved in the job search program, Willie, delivers a powerful, tear-filled monologue about why he has to find a job 'or something, so that he can be a man' that just breaks my heart and lends the film an air of poignance that elevates it above the level of simple comedy. With that said, ""A Piece Of The Action"" is an all time favorite that contains elements of drama, action & suspense (I could watch these people plot, scam and sneak to get Nikki back all day!) and comedy that makes for a very satisfying viewing experience. A Classic. Go get a piece!",1013126400,16,1438,4.921810699588478

P.S.
 I just gotta says some words in honor of my fondest 70's memories overall...The 70's were great clotheswise! You didn't even have to coordinate! Anything you wore, looked good. Orange & Brown, Plaids & Stripes, Bell Bottoms, Platforms, Mini skirts w/pleats, Gaucho's, & Last but not least... lets not forget Airplane collar shirts undone to the navel for guys(some girls too, smh, lol!) & blouses tied below the bust & right above the belly. Fashion Ruled the 70's! & for us kids,Hop Scotch, Engine, engine number 9!.., roller skating, Hide & Seek, catch a girl-kiss a girl(I always got caught on purpose shhh...hee-hee-hee) & Double & Dutch/Irish. YOU FO REAL ""OLD SCHOOL' IF YA KNOW BOUT SOME IRISH! ROFL!  Everything was easy... summer's were the best, I remember parents or aunts & uncles taking us to the drive in & telling us to go play on the swings up under the Big screen. ( Hmmm...I wondered why the sent us off, rofl! Uh-yeah we all know what time it was,... Grown folks needed to talk. YEAH RIGHT, Lol!) Don't cha wish ya could go back! Movies were great! Bruce Lee, Shaft, Superfly, Christie Love! Cartoons were all the rage, wanted to marry ""Speed Racer"" when I was 6. I think it was his eyes, lol! & after school specials, loved them.

292728,4,6300270564,"A Piece of the Action is a 1977 comedy crime film starring Sir Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby. Poitier also directed the film. This was the third film pairing of Poitier and Cosby following Uptown Saturday Night and Let's Do It Again, and Poitier's last acting role for more than 10 years, as he focused his attentions on just directing.

Dave Anderson (Cosby) and Manny Durrell (Poitier) are two high-class sneak thieves who have never been caught. Joshua Burke (James Earl Jones) is a retired detective who has enough evidence on the both of them to put them in jail. Instead, he blackmail them into spend six weeks volunteering as counselors at a inner-city community center run by Leila French (Denise Nicholas) for teenaged delinquents.

The most compelling part of the movie are the scenes that Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby have with the teens who they call ""gorillas"". These scenes are more socially relevant and realistic. ""Poverty Pimps"" classrooms of students where clowning is rewarded, failure is expected, and crabs-in-a-barrel syndrome is the norm.

The ""gorillas"" are the American equivalent of the students in ""To Sir, With Love"" and the ""sweathogs"" in Welcome Back, Kotter. The film is the the very powerful debut of a young and fiesty Sheryl Lee Ralph [Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" Moesha, Designing Women] as very angry Barbara. Many who grew up in the inner-city public school system, may be able to relate very well to Barbara's scathing condemnation of well-meaning counselor Sarah Thomas (Hope Clarke). Many public schooler may still find relvance in every word that Barbara said, as if her words are their own. In a way, her words are their words.

Initially, the thieves are reluctant and unwilling (and so are the teens). As time goes by they gain the trust and admiration of the teens and they start to enjoy the job.

All goes well until someone from the past tells them they have to do one last heist...or else.",1385942400,,1936,4.908256880733945

It is about giving washed up teens a chance, but the lesson in the story line reverts back to the main characters. As they are 'forced' to give back to the community, the community returns the same good deed to them. Great for older teens if parental guidance is available to explain some cultural aspects of the 70's such as afros, bell bottom pants, pointed collars, platform shoes, and soul train dancing at the end.",1318118400,,548,4.545454545454546

But I give credit to both actors as they bravely departed from the familiar cookie-cutter approach, avoiding a simple reprise of their past roles and retreading an already proven formula.

Unfortunately, this also led to a fairly wide swing in terms of storylines, success, and an outright misrepresentation of this particular film itself. While 'Uptown' and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-s-Do-It-Again/dp/B0000W5J4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let's Do It Again</a>"" were straight-up comedies, 'Action' is really two blended productions.

One part, and what you would expect based on the previous two movies, follows the careers of two successful thieves specializing in big scores to finance their self-indulgent lifestyles. The pair, now living on easy street, are unexpectedly ""caught"" by a rather mysterious police detective - years after their bad ol' days. Their comfortable lives up-ended and threatened, the duo are extorted to take on a more civic minded role in the local community center.

The other element of this film, I was disappointed to learn, is clearly meant to be social commentary. A platform to criticize youths and their self-defeating arrogance in shunning the system, a lack of civility, and a life lesson about self-respect. The title of the film is explained this way: Engage the process, not avoid or mock it, in order to get their fair share of the economic pie - their ""piece of the action"". That alone makes this about as appealing as any Democratic Party platform discussion.

There are moments when the old magic is there; when the 'action' is what the cover art promised. But those moments are so few and so far between; the enjoyable completely lost amongst the preachy and sentimental. And at two+ hours, that's a lot of creative educational dogma to digest.

And what made it more difficult to endure were the opening scenes - which were very enticing, exciting and fun. I thought I was going to be treated to a cool action/adventure/comedy similar in vein similar to their previous efforts. If I wanted either of Mr. Thackeray's ""To Sir With Love"" films - I would've rented them.

But you really can't fault either lead actors - they're just so good. It's like something I once read about Laurence Olivier, that he could read the phonebook and still captivate an audience. And like that thespian parable, the performances of all the principals outshines the more mundane elements of the story being told.

And finally, could you honestly come up with two more stunning black actresses from this period? I had forgotten just how beautiful both Tracy Reed and Denise Nicholas were in their prime. Their professional on-screen elegance were touched with just the right amount of subdued sexuality; their collective screen time is almost enough to rescue this production. Almost.

Overall, it's pretty obvious that 'Action' was the jump-the-shark moment for the team, which is really unfortunate. Had Poitier & Cosby delivered what their previous two films promised - I think it would've led to a fourth movie. But what's done is done. We can only appreciate the three movies for what they are; and for me ""Uptown Saturday Night"" will always stand among my favorite 70s-era comedies.",1308096000,,3751,5.453448275862069

292789,5,6300270564,"my dad bought A Piece of the Action at the Dollar store having never seen the movie, and afterwards, we were both glad he did.

A Piece of the Action stars Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier as Dave and Manny. Dave (Cosby) is a master at breaking into safes. Manny (Poitier) is a con-man. A very young James Earl Jones, who plays a retired police detective cons the con-artists into community service in exchange for not going to prison for their crimes.

Along the way, the two develop a friendship and beging to also learn a bit about themselves and a bit of who might be blackmailing them.

The best parts of the movie involve Manny's interactions with a bunch of down on their luck, feel sorry for themselves kids and young adults looking to get a job. His speech is amazing and worth rewinding over and over.

The movie has a bunch of twists and turns and overall, A Piece of the Action is a solid movie. My only gripe is that the movie is a bit long, but overall, it's worth viewing. Especially Sidney and the kids in school.",1264118400,,1026,4.356020942408377

292793,4,6300270564,"At a time when the `blaxploitation' genre was prevalent in the cinema, a handful of individuals tried to provide an intelligent, positive alternative, one being Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier (Lilies of the Field, To Sir, with Love, In the Heat of the Night), with a trio of films he not only directed, but also co-starred in with Bill Cosby, including Uptown Saturday Night (1974), Let's Do It Again (1975), and this feature, titled A Piece of the Action (1977), which would mark Poitier's last role in front of the camera for just over ten years, as he focused his efforts towards directing.  Also appearing is James Earl Jones (Field of Dreams, The Hunt for Red October), Denise Nicholas (Blacula, Let's Do It Again), Hope Clarke (Basquiat), Tracy Reed (Car Wash, Running Scared), and Titos Vandis (The Exorcist, Oh, God!), along with Ja'net DuBois (""Good Times"", I'm Gonna Git You Sucka), Frances Foster (Crooklyn), Eric Laneuville (A Force of One), Ernest `Rog' Thomas (""What's Happening!!""), and Sheryl Lee Ralph (The Mighty Quinn, Skin Deep), in her first film role.

As the film begins we meet two men, Dave Anderson (Cosby), a burglar who specializes in safecracking, and Manny Durrell (Poitier), a conman who's just fleeced a local criminal boss, Mr. Bruno (Vandis) out of a whole lot of dough.  The activities of both men draw the attention of the police, including that of soon to be retired detective Joshua Burke (Jones), but neither man is fingered for their respective crimes...that is until Burke blackmails David and Manny into working for a local community improvement center.  The two men, not knowing their blackmailer, or each other, for that matter, become reluctant philanthropists, stuck having to train and find jobs for 30 inner city juvenile delinquents who seemingly have little desire or motivation to make their lives better, and are only participating in the program because of a court order (one thing they do have a lot of is attitude).  As the men begin their `penance' work, they also try to figure out who is behind their predicament, as if they can discern the identity of their `benefactor', they may also find a way out, but matters become difficult as Dave sort of falls for the woman who heads the community center, Ms. Lila French (Nicholas), while Mr. Bruno and his associates learn the identity of the person responsible for conning them i.e. Manny (it's not so much about the money, but an issue of disrespect).  Interestingly enough, David and Manny's work with the troubled youths begins to show positive results, but they may not be around long enough to enjoy the successes as the mobsters seek their revenge.

While this isn't my favorite Poitier/Cosby pairing, it's still a really well done movie, and definitely worth checking out.  Actually, I believe all three films The Cos and Poitier did were originally intended more for African American audiences, to show they didn't have to settle for the stereotypical black caricatures streaming out of Hollywood at the time, but the movies had such appeal that most all audiences appreciated them, and, subsequently, they did very well.  The main difference here compared to their two, previous outings is this one has less humor and slapsticky comedy.  It's almost like there's two movies here, one dealing with Poitier and Cosby's character trying to get out of their predicament, and then a second featuring Poitier sort of reprising his role from his 1967 film To Sir, with Love, which featured him as a teacher trying to infuse a sense of self worth into a bunch of snotty English students (there are a number of touching, borderline sappy sequences, as the kids come to terms with their reality, and realize they have to make their own opportunities).  Each plot is given equal time, finally converging into one story, resulting in a running time of just over two hours.  Another big difference is here Poitier and Cosby start out as criminals, eventually seeing the error of their ways, while in the previous films their characters were more along the lines of working class fellows who get humorously tangled up with criminal elements.  The chemistry between Poitier and Cosby is most definitely present as it was in the previous films, with Poitier as sort of the straight man to Cosby's comical character, and a lot of credit goes to a strong, professional supporting cast headed by James Earl Jones, as the no nonsense retired detective using the men to help those less fortunate for his own reasons.  It did seem a little odd how quickly the kids caught on and turned things around for themselves, but then Poitier's character did employ some unique techniques.  Another aspect that helped a lot was the inclusion of a number of fine looking women, including Denise Nicholas, Tracy Reed, and Hope Clarke, who are all excellent performers that held their own well against Cosby, Poitier, and Jones.  There was sort of an odd subplot featuring Manny, his girlfriend Nikki, played by Reed (the two were living together), and an unexpected visit from her disapproving parents (and an alcoholic aunt played by DuBois), I wasn't sure where this aspect was going, but I think it was mainly meant to show Manny's affections for Nikki, as later she's kidnapped by the goons, and used as leverage against Poitier's character.  The story moves along well, but given all that's going on in the film, some might get a little lost if they're not paying attention.  Some aspects of the story could have been simplified, or even removed, but given the movie was an all around good time, I didn't mind it running longer than it needed too...I think my favorites scenes involved Bill Cosby's character dancing, once in a disco, and again at the very end during the credits.  I have to say, some of those moves, which I don't think I've ever seen another human being perform, were outta sight.  Oh, before I forget, the movie also features an excellent, original musical score by the legendary rhythm and blues artist Curtis Mayfield.

The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic, looks very good, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through cleanly.  There are some extras included, the main one being a featurette titled Dynamite Duo: A Retrospective (7:30), which includes interviews with actors James Earl Jones, Denise Nicholas, Jimmie Walker, John Amos, Julius Harris, screenwriter Richard Wesley, New York Press critic Armond White, and USC professor and author Todd Boyd.  Also included is a trailer for this film, along with ones for the films Uptown Saturday Night (1974) and Let's Do It Again (1975).
