8005433,5,B00011V8GI,Great quality and quick shipping.  I remembered this story from when I was young.  That magical memory that wasn't all there was driving me crazy!  I'm glad I found it on Amazon and it was worth the purchase.,1443312000,,208,4.421052631578948
8005434,5,B00011V8GI,I saw this movie on TV.  My husband is Hungarian and we happened to take a trip to Hungary and just had to purchase the movie when we got back.,1222560000,2,143,3.7666666666666666
8005435,2,B00011V8GI,"This is the 2nd Harlequin romance turned tv movie I watched. (The first being A Matter of Marriage which I also reviewed) I originally had no interest in the plot when I read it. I only watched Broken Lullaby because the dvd was available in my library and I wanted to see what Harlequin TV movie was like since I bought Diamond Girl and So Hard to Forget (which I am still waiting for and will review as soon as I watch it.) POSSIBLE SPOILERS First off I thought the heroine was a little too hard looking for me. She had a tough girl/strong woman. The hero was definitely good loooking and charming however I didn't feel any romantic chemistry between the two. It just seemed a little forced. I guess the characters in A Matter of Marriage had more of a chemistry (even though I didn't think so at first) than Broken Lullaby. The pacing once again was fast/not boring which was great. I had no problems there. Otherwise, I am STILL glad I watched this movie because I love/used to love Harlequin romance novels when I was a kid. So when my other two dvds arrive, I'll definitely (Id better!) be blown away. As usual, will review Diamond Girl and So Hard to Forget as soon as it comes.",1143072000,5,1185,4.366515837104072
8005436,4,B00011V8GI,"The original ""Broken Lullaby"" was produced in 1932 and is a story of redemption and forgiveness through love (in my opinion).  It is one of the most powerful anti-war movie you will ever experience and is a must-see for all serious movie-goers.",1105401600,7,244,4.809523809523809
8005437,5,B00011V8GI,"An elderly lady is seeking her roots.  She remembers an orphanage and has a picture with a Fabrege egg mounted on a music box.

Ah, the tracking down of picture has stirred up some very interested parties.

One is the grandson of a deposed Arch Duchess -- A Count who wants to retain his title - and the villian of the whole plot.

The niece of the American lady is being pursued by a shadowy figure who is leaving  a string of bodies behind.

We are lead to the inevitable bed scene which did not add to the story - how can people who do not really know each other hop into bed?  And this leads to love???  Yeah! right!

Their trail lead to some interesting discoveries which told the tale [grin] - nicely paced - decent interest without being gory.

will recommend --M",1102032000,12,770,4.284722222222222
