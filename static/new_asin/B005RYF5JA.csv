4861582,5,B005RYF5JA,"Well, I finally got to see Celtic Woman's new show, ""Believe"" on PBS. I really liked it! It was a great show that's beautifully done.
The dvd of ""Believe"" is viewable, not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm not an expert, as some viewers are, when they say it's not clear. I'm hoping they'll present us with a blue ray next time. There's always hope...
I do miss the beautiful Celtic Women, Lynn, Alex, Maeve and Orla, but these three ladies, Lisa K, Lisa L. and Chloe did a magnificent job. Mairead takes fiddle playing to a whole new level and is always a joy to watch.
Lisa Lambe, the new Celtic Woman, has a beautiful voice, blending well with Lisa Kelly and Chlo Agnew. They sang some popular Irish songs, along with the old classics. I'm blown away by how these three amazing singers with Mairead's fiddle playing kept the show going without any feelings of something is amiss.
I loved how Mairead played ""The Foxhunter and ""Mn na hireann"",(""Women of Ireland). The dresses were so beautiful! Love the bagpipes, there's more of them this time. A Riverdance Irish Tap Dancer, Michael Gallagher. is also in this show which makes it an added appeal, especially when he taps when Mairead plays ""Mn na hireann"". Very cute and entertaining!
""Believe"" is filmed for the first time in America at The Fox Theatre in Atlanta, GA. So, paying tribute to this charming theatre that's so famous for its broadway musicals, Chloe and Lisa Kelly sang, ""I Dreamed a Dream"". Lisa Lambe sang, ""Circle of Life"", who is joined later by Chloe and Lisa with the back-up group of singers. Very beautifully done!
I loved it when Lisa and Chloe sing ""The World Falls Away"" and Lisa Lambe joins in at the end, all three skip across the stage to finish the song These four Celtic Woman give high entertainment which makes you want to sing along.
I loved Lisa Lambe's ""A Spaceman Came Traveling"". She puts her all into the song and is not afraid to move around on the stage. Her dress flowed as she danced and twirled to this song.
Chloe's ""Ave Maria"" was resung by her more matured voice, and she did another amazing job. She didn't do too bad at age fifteen either when she sang another style of this song.
Lisa again gave it her all when she sang ""Follow on"" and ""The Water is Wide. She still my favorite and will always be.
Here is a list of songs that will be on the dvd or the cd of ""Believe"".
*1.""Awakening""--Lisa Kelly, Chlo Agnew, Lisa Lambe with Mirad Nesbitt (Opening song)
*2.""Nocturne"" sung by Chloe Agnew accompanied by Mairead. (A winning song in the Eurovision Song Contest 1995)
*3.""Sailing"" sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe accompanied by Maraid Nesbitt.
*4.""The Foxhunter"" played by Mairead Nesbitt which was very entertaining!
*5.""The Water is Wide"" sung by Lisa Kelly accompanied by Mairead Nesbitt (This is a folk song of Scottish or English origin.)
*6.""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" sung by Kelly, Agnew, Lambe with the choir,'The Gwinnett Young Singers'. (This is a Paul Simon's song, he wrote it)
*7.""Black is the Colour"" sung by Lisa Lambe (A Scottish folk song)
*8.""Follow On"" sung by Lisa Kelly
*9.""Ave Maria (Schubert)"" sung by Chloe Agnew
*10.""Tir Abhaile Ri"" sung and danced by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe with Mairead Nesbitt and Michael Gallagher with his Irish tap.
*11.""You'll Never Walk Alone""  sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe with Mairead Nesbitt and ""The Gwinnett Young Singers"".
*12.""A Spaceman Came Travelling"" sung by Lisa Lambe (A popular Christmas song in the UK)
*13. A tribute to Broadway sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe and Lisa Lambe (Songs sung are ""I Dreamed a Dream"" & ""Circle of Life""
*14.""A Woman's Heart""  sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe (This is an Irish song composed by Elenor McEvoy.)
*15.""The Parting Glass"" sung by Lisa Kelly, Chloe Agnew, Lisa Lambe with Mairead Nesbitt (This is a very popular Irish song and the last song they sung for this concert)
*16.""Green Grow the Rushes"" is sung by Chloe and Lisa Kelly. This is a Irish folk song sometimes sung as a Christmas Carol.
*17.""The World Falls Away"" sung by Chloe and Lisa Kelly with Lisa Lambe coming in at the end.
*18.""Mn na hireann"" is played by Mairead with Michael Gallagher joining in later.
*19.""Smile"" sung by Chloe, Lisa Kelly and Lisa Lambe with Mairead (Cappella)
*20.""My Heart was Home Again"" sung by Lisa K. and Lisa L.
*21.""Walking the Night"" sung by Chloe and Lisa L.
All I can say is, these are some amazing songs that Lisa Kelly, Lisa Lambe, Chloe and Mairead perform so well.  It's well worth the money to see and listen to them whenever you want in the privacy of your own home.",1323043200,83,4624,4.629719853836784
4861583,5,B005RYF5JA,"I was lucky enough to be there for the taping of the show.  Yes, that is me up in the balcony.  I watched the show last night on PBS and nearly as good as being there.  I can not wait to receive the DVD and being able to watch whenever I can.",1323043200,2,242,3.6153846153846154
4861584,4,B005RYF5JA,"I just watched the PBS showing of the Believe tour tonight and ... although the PBS showing does not include the entire concert, I thought it might be helpful to at least of few of the people (those who buy at a more reasonable price rather than the PBS price for this DVD), to output a few of my thoughts.

Let me first say that I feel reviewing the `performance rather than the product' is on the edge of impropriety in this particular venue, but many people who read these reviews don't realize that, and actually think that critiquing the performance itself IS what this site was intended to achieve. It is for them that I write this.

It depends on your expectations how pleased or disappointed you will be with this performance. If you have not seen the previous shows, my guess is that you will enjoy this show a lot more than if you have seen their earlier performances. Unfortunately, if you have watched the earlier shows, you will have to overcome the disappointment of knowing that it has been downsized by 20%, following the departure of 2 extraordinarily talented ladies and replacing the two of them with one. There again... it probably isn't realistic to expect the same level of satisfaction. Even beyond the adjustment long time fans must make, (losing two people who close followers had grown to love), it is exponentially harder to fill that void created by replacing two with only one. What could they have been thinking when they made that decision?

It appears as though they tried to fill part of the void by adding a `river dance guy' to dance while Mairead plays the fiddle. Also ... to add some variety, they added some children to the routine in the hope of making it more of an extravaganza. Personally I don't want it to be a variety show when the name of the show is Celtic Woman.

The song selections have changed noticeably, with practically no carryovers from their other tours although Ave Maria has been once again resurrected for this tour. What I find the most bazaar selection though, was when Lisa Lambe sings Black is the Colour. This ballad is normally reserved for male singers, and I think that if sung by a woman, it needs the gender of the lyrics reversed (unless it truly was intended to be made a lesbian rendition).

Another thing about this show is the seemingly unnecessary use of handheld microphones. If anyone can explain WHY they used them please fill me in. For my liking they have no place and no purpose. They are usually used to hide the mouth of a singer who is lip-syncing. It doesn't seem to be explained by the possible audio improvement either. The audio quality was no better using them so that doesn't explain it. And on the topic of audio quality, the PBS special had audio which was much too compressed and it was also highly homogenized to the point where the stereo separation only gives you a small dimensional array (and yes ... I have a sound system which is extremely capable of recreating whatever the signals source has the potential to generate.)

...........................Now that the DVD has been released, I am amending this portion of my review to appropriately recognize the quality of the DVD itself. I had previously stated at this point in my review (before the DVD was released) that the last DVD (for Songs From the Heart) was inexcusably poor in video quality, even for a standard definition version. The good news is this one is better than the last; the bad news is, it still doesn't do justice to the capability of the source material. The show was recorded in HD for the PBS broadcast and yet there is no HD disc being offered. Two years ago less than half of all homes had HD TV, but now the transition into HD broadcasting has caused a reversal in this statistic, and additionally ... the price of both the TV and the Bluray players is a third of what it was, For this reason it seems truly inconceivable that an HD disc is not even an option. Worst of all, HD TV causes the shortcomings of standard definition quality to be more noticeably. For this reason it is just that much more imperative for this type of performance to be offered in the best quality possible. Two years ago I might have agreed to a coin flip whether or not to go Bluray, but today it's a no-brainer (at least in my mind).  [Enough said about the video...... it is what it is.]

The audio is somewhat better on the disc then what I was experiencing from the PBS broadcast. Whether it is cleaner sounding simply because it has gone through fewer circuit boards or whether it is a different audio mix, I can't say (but in general the audio is improved). One thing I noticed right away was that the shrillness that I heard in Lisa K's voice in the PBS broadcast of the song Follow On had disappeared on the DVD.  Even the expansion of the sound stage is improved to some degree. Unfortunately the amount of compression (lack of dynamic range) of the sound is just as overdone on the disc, and the balance of volume between the singers and the background singers, children's choir, and/or the bagpipers, is at times so far off that the girls are almost being drown out.

The DVD cover says Believe Live but in my opinion that is stretching the truth. Yes it is all done at once (in front of a `live' audience), but some of the audio clearly does not match the video. I mention in my earlier comments `the use of hand microphones' and how they sometimes are used to camouflage lip-syncing; in this show it seems to be the other way around. The `live singing' is done with the hand mikes. As for the rest ...... well you be the judge.

One very welcome addition on the DVD was the song My Heart Was Home Again. Even though it was sung with the distraction of the hand mikes, it was sung beautifully and it didn't have the 32 children, the battalion of bagpipers, the overly loud backup chorus or even the riverdance guy to detract from its beauty. A very welcome surprise indeed!

I hope you find this information worth while. (Please don't forget to read the followup comments by clicking below)",1322956800,63,6060,4.529250457038391

If you haven't seen this and are getting ready to watch it for the first time, you'd better have a box of kleenex handy because you are gonna need it. Any concert that can stir a heart to tears like this one does, HAS to be devinely inspired. The songs they chose for this concert are truly some of the most beautiful songs in the history of music. Everytime i hear them sing ""A Woman's Heart,"" and, particularly, when Chloe Agnew sings her renditions of ""Nocturne"" and ""Ave Maria"", tears start streaming down my cheeks. The only way this concert could possibly be any better is if someday it is released on bluray. If ever it is, I will be first in line at Best Buy, the day it is released, to buy it.

4861682,5,B005RYF5JA,"When it first arrived, I was totally captivated.  I listened to it every day for a month (still ongoing).  I had thought it would be impossible for any concert to approach the tremendous power of  ""Songs From the Heart"".  I was wrong.  The atmosphere is different from most of their past work, but extremely well done.  I was afraid that when they went to only three voices and lost Alex Sharp and Lynn, that the quality of sound and voices must surely go down.  I was wrong again.  This is a real treat for the eyes and ears both.  Hint:  hear it as it deserves to be heard.  I got a new and more powerful audio program and Bose speakers for my computer and was completely blown away.  If you like the ""Celtic"" sound, with drums and chorus, you owe it to yourself to hear this.  Highly recommended.",1391558400,3,799,4.3175675675675675

Previously the cast changes were seamless but they have made one change too many this time. The songs were dull and lacked something, so much so that as I write I could not even tell you the name of any songs on the disc.

The orchestra, the costumes and of course these talented beautiful girls come together for a show you will want to watch again and again.  The old Irish folk songs are certainly done well, along with other contemporary songs.  The song they do with the children will bring tears to your eyes, and the dancing will make you want to get up and join them.  My son just told me they are coming on a tour in our area.  I would love to see this show live, but if you can't these dvds make it possible to see them at home.  I plan to buy some of the others.

Even though they only have 3 singers now instead of the original 5 there is no lack in the beautiful harmony we have always heard and loved. It always amazes me how they can continue to find new girls that blend so well with the previous singers.  Lisa Lambe is no exception.  She is just as wonderful a singer as Lisa and Chloe.
The costumes are outstanding as usual.  The set itself is great and love the different touches they have brought to us this time.  The bagpipes are always a favorite and the extra dancing is a nice touch.  The use of the childrens choir in ""Bridge over Troubled Water""  is wonderful.
The filming is clear and on the same level as all the other DVD's have been.  I would buy this again in a heart beat.  Can not wait until they make the next one.",1353369600,,937,4.132596685082873

I have made it a habit of buying the music and DVD album simultaneously when they come out--you can't go wrong with this one!

In fact, for the last couple of albums, I've made it a point to extract the DVD audio from the album so I can listen to the live performance and not have to watch it. Quite Nice!

I BELIEVE there were four songs on the DVD that were not on the PBS special to make up for the PBS breaks.

4861808,5,B005RYF5JA,"I've been hooked on CW for a while.  I recorded the ""Songs from the Heart"" PBS concert on my DVR in March 2011.  I pray the box never goes bad or I will loose the recording.  I did copy it using a DVD burner (borrowed from Best Buy) but the audio was just 2 channel and not the 5.1 Dolby of my recording.  Ibroke down and downloaded it from I-tunes.  All of summer 2011 I anxiously awaited the new concert and for it to air.  I knew Alex Sharpe had left (I love her solo of You'll be in my Heart) but was in shock when I saw that Lynn had left too.  At first I was not sure about her replacement, Lisa Lambe.  It did not take long but I was hooked on her voice and the sexiness she brings to the stage in the concert.  I was going to buy tickets for the NY show in March.  Glad I didn't because I found out that Lisa Kelly had gone on maternity leave.  I have the Believe concert from PBS on my DVR as well and used Audacity to record the audio to my computer.  Good thing recordings don't go on vinyl or tape, because I would have worn them out already.  It is just about the only thing I listen too.  I am hoping that Lisa Kelly returns.  From interviews, she has said she loves being on the road with her family.  With the CW concert schedule, they certainly don't stay anywhere long enough for any moss to grow.  I have not yet heard Susan McFadden, and wonder if she will stay to return the group to 4 vocalists.",1330992000,,1417,3.98576512455516
4861809,3,B005RYF5JA,"Now before I start my review I want to first prove that I'm a Celtic Woman fan because I'm sure what I have to say about this performance will upset some of the more dedicated Celtic Woman fans. In addition to having almost every CD, DVD, and solo album I traveled from SF to the city of Quebec, literally from one end of the continent to the other to see former CW member Meav perform at the Quebec Celtic Music Festival, and it was well worth the journey.

Now with regards to CW Believe I'm afraid that the group has hit its all time low...

First off the group has only three singers; CW prior to this has always had at least 4 singers (CW New Journey had 5 singers) and you can clearly see/hear the difference with one less singer. And personally I feel that they tried to substitute this with what I felt was cheap theatrics such as all the dancing and the confetti at the end.

Second, I feel that Lisa Lambe falls short of the mark; now she is a very good singer with a very lovely voice but I feel that she fails to measure up to previous CW members such as Meav or Lynn who are exceptional singers.

And thirdly, I feel that the show wasn't very Celtic; Mairead was really the only celtic element in the performance. It seemed like they had very few celtic songs when they normally have a even balance between celtic, pop, and classical music; this performance had mostly pop songs. Personally I think that CW became less celtic when Orla Fallon left.

Now saying all that I still enjoyed watching the concert, I thought it was well done and very entertaining; I particularly loved the songs ""Bridge over Troubled Waters"", ""Tir Abhaile Ri"", ""Green Grow The Rushes"", and ""Ave Maria""",1330646400,8,1691,4.407051282051282

The addition of the kids choir was outstanding. The addition of Lisa Lambe was another great surprise. Her rendition of ""Black Is the Colour"" and ""A Spaceman Came Travelling"" was fantastic. I have also seen them in person three times and they never disappoint. I could go on but I think you get the picture. If you are a fan you will love this!",1330387200,,554,4.388349514563107

I was fully entertained by the musicans, the dancers, the children, but especially the women (I fell in love instantly with Chloe.)  If those reviewers were disappointed by this performance, I really need to find out what they liked so much that now has them disappointed ...which would surely be my next purchase. I have over a hundred concerts on DVD, and I would definitely rate this one in the top ten.",1329350400,,807,5.037593984962406
4861823,2,B005RYF5JA,"As a long-time Celtic Woman fan, I was looking forward to this new DVD.
I've just finished watching it all the way through for the third time and listening to it without the distracting video to see if I could get turned on to it at all.
It's flat. It has no ""zing"".
Everything seems to be sung in ""pastel"" tones. It's hard to tell one song from another.
There isn't a real lilting, barn-burning traditional number in the whole show.
The new Lisa does nothing at all for me, but I suspect it's because she's hampered by the song selections, being overly-made-up (WAY too much lipstick!) and the over-choreographed production. The show could have been partly resurrected with a couple of their traditional Irish things, and ""You Raise Me Up"" at the end, which was never a bad way to end a Celtic Woman show.
I have to mention the butchering of one of my favorite songs: ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", which NOBODY but Simon and Garfunkel should ever have attempted.
I suspect that someone high up in the management never understood just what it was that made CW great. They need to rediscover it fast, before they kill the group. Go back to your roots. PLEASE! I want to see and hear the REAL Celtic Woman again.",1329177600,4,1210,4.529680365296803
4861824,5,B005RYF5JA,"During two sold out nights at The Fox Theatre (Atlanta, GA) in Sept 2011 the live concert DVD was filmed for the first time in America in front of some of Celtic Woman's most loyal fans. Instead of listening to the CD, I saw the DVD first and not only is the whole performance a sight to behold but the set design and wardrobe were breathtaking. I loved the stunning dresses, that are pictured below, the best. They are gorgeous and the bead work and embroidery is lovely! The set is beautiful too. I love all the scroll work that went into it and the drapery, arch and chandeliers give it a nice touch. I love the opening song of the DVD. Tears of joy were welling up in my eyes at the sight and sound of it. My favorite part of the DVD was ""The Foxhunter"". Since I play the violin (albeit not that well) I have a love for violin music. My heart swelled at Mirad Nesbitt's performance. She is a spectacular violinist and she can dance while she plays. For ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" they brought on a children's choir to sing with them. For ""Green Grow The Rushes"" they involved the audience with the singing. ""Mn na hireann"" is another violin piece played by Mirad, but an Irish clog dancer also takes the stage. The songs ""My Heart Was Home Again"", ""A Tribute to Broadway"", ""Green Grow The Rushes"", ""Smile"", and ""Mn na hireann"" are additions to the DVD and not included on the CD. The next to the last song on the DVD before the credits, ""The Parting Glass"", sets a great grand finale as several bagpipers (more than I have ever seen in a performance) come out of the woodwork and onto the stage to join Celtic Woman. I am so excited to also be able to go to their concert with my husband in April and see them up close in the Keller Auditorium.

4861825,5,B005RYF5JA,Aha Believe is different than the previous 2 concerts. Shane (2006) and Powerscourt (2009) were outdoors and Believe is indoors. All three are brilliant. I think Shane and Powerscourt were very similiar so Believe is quite different which is good. The performers changed between each concert which obviously were caused by the contractual agreements. The Believe concert is full of music that is upbeat a bit from the other two concerts. All the performers over the years have been very angelic sounding and the latest concert is no different. The fiddler continues to be a joy to see and hear. Lisa K is off having another baby which is not the first time this has happened to the tour. David continues to pour his brilliance into the groups music in Atlanta as in the past. So yes their latest concert is different but not one ioda less in stunning enjoyment.,1329091200,,861,4.746666666666667

Not with the venue, the songs, or the orchestration.
Here's whats disappointing:
The quality of the video is horrible. Anything other than a closeup is fuzzy. It's not my dvd player or my tv causing the problem, it's the dvd itself. Not asking for blu-ray perfection, just the same quality I get from every other concert/movie I have in my collection. I don't even own a blu-ray player.
Also disappointing is the way Celtic Woman is becoming like a box of chocolates,,,,,,,,,,,,you never know what you're gonna get. Last year Alex & Lynn were introduced, but just as soon as you warmed up to them, they're gone. Now we have Lisa L (who I think is fantastic) replacing Alex & Lynn. How long will she be around? Don't get too attached.
In reality Celtic Woman should be called Celtic Trio,,, with Chloe, Maried & Lisa K (when she's not having a baby), along with one or two temporary fill-ins as needed.
I hope they don't start taking their fans for granted & just throw anybody/anything out there, figuring the name itself is enough of a draw. Fans have their limits.

4861829,3,B005RYF5JA,"Regretfully I can't gush over 'Believe'.
It's just not as good as previous shows  -- my critique is aimed solely at the Producers, not the girls, who are wonderful.

SONG SELECTION:
Too many of the numbers did nothing for me -- that's one man's opinion, subjective as it is.
Hopefully, in the fullness of time, one or two might grow on me.

LOCATION:

Why oh why did they record the concert in Atlanta?

We can all agree that the Fox is a beautiful theater -- if you're doing GONE WITH THE WIND you couldn't find better.

This is an Irish group, surely they could find another suitable location in Ireland?

No doubt the girls sing just as beautifully in Atlanta, but outside of the Motherland you do lose a certain ineffable something.

Maybe it's money, maybe it was cheaper to tape in Atlanta?
If it was a financial decision --  I've heard there are some nice theaters in Kazakhstan that rent for a song  (pun intended)

Please, for goodness sakes, go back home for the next one.
I don't care if you tape the show in the Ladies Room of the Dublin Central Railway Station, just DO IT IN IRELAND !

HOW MANY STARS?

Has anyone else noticed that the number of 'stars' is going down ?
'New Journey' had 6 ( 5 singers + 1 ), 'Songs From The Heart' had 5, this one has 4.
Are the Producers trying to shave costs here too?

With this sort of downward progression, how long can it be before they trot out our beautiful Chloe to do the show solo?
(and then I expect they will remind us that the name is CELTIC WOMAN, singular ! )

Now just to prove I'm not 100% grinch, I must praise Management for their choice of Lisa Lambe ( Lisa #2 )
She's a ravishing stunning redhead with a perfectly enunciated angelic voice.
Were I only 20 years younger?  ( Okay, let's get real, 30 years younger.)

PS: ""Jumping the Shark"" alludes to an episode from the HAPPY DAYS sitcom, in which Fonzie jumped over a plastic shark.  A critic later opined that the show went down-hill after that, and in fact it was cancelled not long thereafter.",1328572800,3,2017,4.347593582887701
4861830,5,B005RYF5JA,"This DVD is brilliant. The quality is superb and the show is vibrant. I have followed CW right from the start when Chloe Agnew's singing was somewhat subdued. In this show, she bursts out and reveals that she truly does have a beautiful and strong voice. Lisa Kelly is fantastic as always whilst newcomer Lisa Lambe blends beautifully with the other two. Her rendition of ""Black Is The Colour"" is wonderful as it is not an easy number to sing. Mairead is also her usual self and gives two great solo performances.
The audience was so impressed with the girls that they received standing ovations after every number - something that I have not seen at a concert before.
As a fan from the beginning, I think that this is at least equal to any other of their concert DVDs and I thoroughly recommend this.",1328572800,,801,4.531034482758621

4861832,5,B005RYF5JA,"They were five in their first concert: four vocalists (Lisa Kelly, Chlo Agnew, Mav Ni Mhaolchatha and Olga Falon) plus a small blonde angel, fallen straight from Heaven for our utmost felicity: Mirad Nesbitt, an outstanding violinist.

They were six in their second one: ""A New Journey"" (their masterpiece in my opinion, for which I wrote a long review in Amazon on February 4, 2007) when Hayley Westenra joined them for that unique concert.

But they are only four in their fifth concert: only three vocalists instead of four and the violinist.  Lisa Kelly is still there, Chlo Agnew is also still there, as same as Mirad, the soul of the group, mastering her fiddle like Paganini, jumping and dancing like ""Les Nymphes des Bois"" (""The Nymphs of the Woods"") depicted by French poets of ""La Pliade"" in the XVIth century.  But Mav and Olga are no longer with the group.  We miss their charm and Olga's harp.

In fact, they had already disappeared from the fourth concert (""Songs from the Heart""), where they had been replaced by two other girls called Alex and Lynn, who have also disappeared in the meantime.

The third girl in this fifth concert is called Lisa Lambe, a charming young woman with long curly reddish hair and her voice harmonizes very well with those of Lisa Kelly and Chlo.  In fact, you will see plenty of new faces in this DVD, not only in the choir but also in the orchestra.

Unlike Adre Rieu's concerts, where the numbers are separated by endless jokes and explanations, sometimes in Dutch, which only a handful of people understand, there is no dead time in Celtic concerts.  As it was already the case in the four previous shows, the public is still applauding that the next number is already rolling.

The whole concert is thus only 1h30 long, but there is an extra chapter showing its preparation.

Like the first and third concerts (""Celtic Woman"" and ""A Christmas Celebration""), this one is staged indoors.  This time, it is at the legendary FOX Theater on Peachtree Street in Atlanta.  Maybe the bad souvenir of their fourth concert (""Songs from the Heart"", staged in the gardens of the Powerscourt House in Ireland), where it was raining one hour before the show started, dissuaded the group from giving another outdoor show!  How about a ""Christmas Concert"" 2012 in Miami Beach, where it is bright, warm and sunny all year round?  I'm sure that would be a big hit!  Better do it before December 21st, just in case...

If the first four concerts contained mostly well known songs from several countries and epochs, this new one has very few of those immortal numbers and contains many songs that I had never heard before.

Like in all previous shows, this DVD opens with the presentation of the now only three vocalists, angel Mirad and composer David Downes, Musical Director.

The first number is ""Awakening"".  It starts with a few notes from a flute followed by Mirad and her violin.  Then Chlo, Lisa and Lisa sing with drums in the background during the whole song.

As it was the case in all their concerts, this show combines music, songs and dances, and instead of standing still, our vocalists move and dance continuously in almost every number, fulfilling the goal of French Symbolist playwrights at the end of the XIXth century: ""Le Spectacle Total"" (""Total Show"").

""Follow On"", the second number, starts with a choir followed by Lisa Kelly singing a sweet song, contrasting with all the movement of the first one.

""The Foxhunter"" is an instrumental number with Mirad and her violin at the beginning, joined later by the drums in a very fast melody where she is at her best: she jumps, she dances, she turns like a spinning top, earning a well deserved standing ovation.

The fourth number is ""Nocturne"".  Mirad opens slowly with her violin and Chlo soon arrives singing alone a melancholic song after all the movement from the previous one.

This is followed by ""Sailing"", a sweet song interpreted by all three girls, ending with a standing ovation.

""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", which was a great success in 1969 during the Viet Nam war, is one of the few well known songs in this concert.  Each girl sings a few verses before singing all three together. Then a children's choir jumps in, creating a magic moment, as it is always the case with women's or children's choirs, greater yet when they both join their voices.  This number alone would justify the purchase of this DVD!  Naturally, this was followed by a well deserved standing ovation.  Unlike the audience of Andre Rieu's concert in Ireland, where everybody seemed to be screwed to the chair, the Atlanta public kept going up and down most all the time!

The following number is ""Black is the Colour"" (NO misprint: this is the British spelling...), interpreted by Lisa Lambe

""The World Falls Away"", song number 8, opens with a bagpipe; then, all three girls jump in, singing and dancing with drums in the background.

Number 9 is ""My Heart Was Home Again"".  Lisa Kelly starts alone, joined later by Lisa Lambe.

""A Tribute to Broadway"" opens with a few words by Lisa Kelly who starts singing the song, soon joined by Chlo.  After a few notes of flute, Kelly Lambe sings alone in the lower stage while the two others climb to the upper stage where the choir is waiting.  After a drums intervention, the choir goes down to the lower stage and all girls sing together the end of the song.  This is followed by another standing ovation.

""Tir Abhaile Ri"" is a fast song favoring dances by the three vocalists and the women's choir.  Four male choristers join them in the upper stage.  Once again, Mirad plays, runs, jumps and turns around.  A tap dancer does some steps towards the end.  Once again, the public gives a standing ovation.

The following number is ""A Woman's Heart"", interpreted by all three vocalists.  This is a nice melancholic song.

""The Water is Wide"", song number 12, is interpreted by Lisa Kelly.  Towards the middle of the song, a bagpipe appears on the upper stage, greeted by applauses as if they were in Scotland!

A choir first, then Chlo Agnew, start ""Green Grow the Rushes"" and she is joined by Lisa Kelly and a choir, that keeps them company during the rest of this nice sweet song.

""You'll Never Walk Alone"", another well known song, groups all three vocalists, each as a soloist at the beginning and Mirad behind them; later, the adults and children's choirs jump in, creating another magic moment in this great concert.  As you would expect, this number was followed by an extensive standing ovation.

""Smile"", a famous song composed in the 1950s on a musical theme of Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" (1936) is interpreted by all vocalists, who start a cappella, soon joined discretely by Mirad.  If you missed ""A Second Journey"", rush to your local store, buy it and see the outstanding a cappella interpretation of the immortal ""Over The Raimbow"", created by Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz"" in 1939 and wonderfully interpreted by Suzan Erens in Andr Rieu's ""The Flying Dutchman"".  Once again, this number was followed by a standing ovation.

After ""Smile"", ""Walking the Night"" is a languorous song.  Lisa Lambe opens it, followed by Chlo.

""A Spaceman Came Travelling"" starts with drums and is interpreted by Lisa Lambe with a choir.  Lots of drums and dancing fill this song full of movement.

""Ave Maria"", Schubert's immortal melody, is mostly interpreted by Chlo as a soloist in the original Latin version.  Hard core opera aficionados will argue that Chlo does not have (yet) the power of Maria Callas, Jessye Norman, Barbara Hendricks, Carmen Monarca, Carla Mafioletti, Rene Fleming or Sarah Brightman, to name just a few among the best known sopranos.  So what?  When the adults and children's choirs jump in from time to time, they create a great atmosphere and the audience gave a well deserved standing ovation at the end.

Mirad plays ""Mn Na Hirean"" with David at the piano.  This starts very slowly but soon becomes a fast melody with the tap dancer we previously saw.  If you like tap dancing, you may see Arthur Duncan, one of the masters in this field, during ""The Lawrence Welk Show"", which is broadcasted every Sunday at 7 pm on PBS Channel 2 in Miami.

""The Parting Glass"" is the last number, interpreted by all three vocalists.  They start a cappella, then Mirad joins them, then the orchestra starts discretely, joined later by bagpipes and the movement goes crescendo to the end.

I was disappointed to see that their usual last number, a masterpiece written by Rolf Loveland and Brendan Graham and made famous by Josh Groban titled ""You Raise Me Up"", which concluded their first, second and fourth concerts, was no longer there:  ""I am strong when I am on your shoulders, you raise me up to more than I can be"" is the leitmotiv of this great composition.

This song ""You Raise Me Up"", which rightfully concluded all of Celtic Woman's previous concerts except for ""A Christmas Celebration"", always reminds me of ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray"" by Oscar Wilde, which I studied with my French students in the ""Grand Paris"" during several years:  Our French translation said:  ""Aimer, c'est se surpasser"".  ""Loving, is transcending oneself""

Although I still think that ""A New Journey"" is Celtic Woman's masterpiece (how could you get any better after you have attained perfection?), I don't regret the purchase of this excellent DVD which contains 21 very good songs, most of which I had never heard in any of the languages that I speak, with several magic moments that I already pointed out in the above synopsis.",1328313600,2,9573,4.759854457246816

We watched in our home theatre the night we got the DVD.

The quality was good, sound was nice. If I haven't seen the previous two DVDs, I might actually think it was okay. But knowing the previous DVDs and this one was very, unimpressive. At the end we actually still looking for an exciting song.

A lot of the singers disappeared. Some were not totally great but we used to their moves and voices. So having only Lisa and Chloe was disappointing. The new Lisa is pretty but, she is quite showy and different, doesn't really blend in well. Mairead looked a bit uninspired this time also. I guess we were expecting another 100% masterpiece, and could not tolerate an 80% performance.

(A Tribute to Broadway is listed as a song, but actually is made up of two: I Dreamed a Dream and Circle of Love.) With the DVD at $12.99, that's $0.59 per song.

4861840,5,B005RYF5JA,"I listen to lots of music. But I rarely write reviews on music that I have listened. That's because I don't think good music can be described by words. There are two types of music I most often listen to, extremely masculine music such as heavy metal and thrash metal, and extremely feminine music with angelic female voice such as Celtic Woman. Before I bought this CD, I had watched Celtic Woman's concert titled ""Believe"" on PBS. It was an absolutely ravishing performance. I think they really should make a blu-ray version in addition to the DVD version. While all four performers have beautiful stage presence and incredible charisma, Chloe seems the leading type. Compared to their first concert, which was more purely singing, their recent concerts including the ""Believe"" concert have more performing elements, which brings more viewing pleasure. While I like all the songs in this album, I have been particularly enthralled by ""A Woman's Heart"". I was completely carried away by the performance of that song. I look forward to their live concert in Houston on April 16. I noticed some complaint regarding the video quality of the DVD.

4861841,3,B005RYF5JA,"Like most others here, I saw the show on PBS.  What is their director thinking?  The choice of songs was really off. I am tired of hearing Ave Maria,  not to mention Bridge Over Troubled Waters which I thoroughly hate. I don't want to hear songs that have been over-done by others. They need to be a little more creative about what they sing.  They are Celtic Woman so I prefer they do a predominance of that type of music. Their singing was fine but I was suspicious it was not a live performance.

Their new singer is great and I enjoyed watching her even if a little over-exhuberant. Chloe needs to stop holding her arms out at her sides. She looks unnatural and I was hoping she had stopped doing that pose. Her singing has improved and is lovely. I personally like the addition of the children singing with them and I am assuming it was to add to this particular show since it was lacking in the number of singers. Perhaps they couldn't find women with the availability to do the tour. Unlike others here I liked the step dancing addition.  It was very refreshing to see something added to the show that enhanced the performance. There is no reason they can't have dancers and other things (special guests) for their numbers. As for reviewing the disc itself, I don't intend on buying it because of all these issues.

I hope this next show will have more than two singers with Lisa going on maternity leave. As for the blueray, there are numbers of people still using the older television sets and having blueray will make no difference even if they can play them. I haven't noticed this big significant difference and I have a new tv and possibly blueray is slightly better than DVD but I could care less. I want DVDs and not blueray. Hopefully they will offer that but I don't see the need personally. I've always considered it nothing more than a money making scheme.",1326499200,8,1875,4.480938416422287

This one was disappointing enough that I stopped watching before the end. To me the musical numbers sounded practically indistinguishable from one another, and were musically boring. The performances also seemed more theatrical and less genuine than in other concerts, as if the singers were overly choreographed and weren't really engaging with what they were singing.

I missed the crystal clarity of the missing voices of Maev, Hayley, Alex, and Lynn from prior tours. Second, most of the pieces were either solos or unison arrangements and the overall impression comes across as musically anemic and unpolished compared with the rich harmonies and tight timing synch of the prior tours.  I was looking forward to seeing this next tour in person, but will most likely pass on this year's version as it is not up to the standard I have come to expect in Celtic Woman performances.

4861846,3,B005RYF5JA,"I just think they use their arms too much. Like in 'A Spaceman Came Travelling' - how to the arms add to the song at all?
And I always thought a tribute was more than two songs, but there you go.
A New Journey is still, and will seemingly always be, my favourite Celtic Woman concert.",1325462400,6,284,4.089285714285714

Internationally acclaimed vocal phenomenon Celtic Woman announce their sixth new project, BELIEVE, an enchanting studio album and companion live concert DVD available in stores on January 24. Celtic Woman is the all-female singing sensation featuring vocalists Chlo Agnew, Lisa Kelly, Lisa Lambe and Celtic violinist Mirad Nesbitt performing classic Irish songs (""The Water Is Wide,"" ""Green Grow the Rushes,"" ""A Woman's Heart,"" ""The Parting Glass""), timeless pop anthems (""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" ""Sailing""), and inspirational songs (""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" ""Ave Maria"") with their signature Celtic Woman twist, under the distinct musical direction of Emmy-nominated music producer, David Downes. The live concert DVD was filmed for the first time in America in front of some of their most loyal fans during two sold-out nights at The Fox Theatre (Atlanta, GA) in Sept 2011.",1325030400,,1354,4.977876106194691
4861849,5,B005RYF5JA,I am a big fan of Celtic Woman and try to pick up their cds/dvds whenever available.  The voices are so pure and their range is amazing.  I hope they get back some of the ladies that have left their group.,1324598400,2,205,3.975609756097561
4861850,5,B005RYF5JA,"I've watched the latest Celtic Woman special ""Believe"" the last two nights in a row and actually believe it to be the most entertaining one yet.  I've watched ""A New Journey"" and ""Songs from the Heart"" probably hundreds of times and, despite that, there are usually some songs that do not appeal to me and I jump over.  I absolutely loved every song from this latest show.  Lisa is spectacular as usual, (I will miss her during her upcoming maternity leave,) Chloe has never been better and the enthusiasm of Lisa Lambe is starting to grow on me, I just love the way she dances around the stage.  What can you say about Mairead other than that she is incredible as usual.
My question is about what they will do with the DVD release?  (Why they cannot release these on blu-ray I do not know.)  On the PBS showing of ""Songs from the Heart,"" one of the highlights was Alex Sharpe's ""You'll Be In My Heart.""  When the DVD was released this song was gone and replaced with Alex's ""True Colors"" which, while good, was not as good as the other one.  It was even worse with Lynn Hillary's ""Carolina Rua"" which was neither on the PBS special or the DVD.  The only place I was able to see it was on the Amazon Celtic Woman store and it was spectacularly enjoyable.  I firmly believe that the cancellation of this song was the beginning of the road for Lynn's departure from Celtic Woman.  (I met her in person at a Celtic Woman appearance and told her how much I enjoyed the song, she seemed genuinely appreciative.)
I see only ten songs listed in the Amazon ad for the DVD.  Is this possible?  There were more songs on the PBS special and I'm sure there were several cut out of that.  I just wish they would rerelease all of the concerts on blu-ray and add back all of the songs taken out.
Anyway I'll buy the DVD when it comes out, not only for the music but the special features. (I can never watch enough of Lisa Kelly.)
But I will keep my copy of the PBS special on DVR as well, just in case.",1323475200,27,1987,4.278074866310161
4861851,5,B005RYF5JA,"Watched the concert on PBS last night...stunning!!!  MUCH better than the other concerts & I adored them. The new girl is WOW!!!  Sorry to see they let the other 2 girls go, but.....",1323388800,,182,4.484848484848484
4861852,4,B005RYF5JA,"Having just watched the new show on PBS, I must say I am less than thrilled with the song selection.  There were some good ones which I enjoyed immensely but there were far too many new ones which I did not particularly like.  I guess I am just old fashioned.  I do have some concerns however.  It has already been stated that Lisa Kelly will not be in the show when it goes on tour next year.  She will be extremely difficult to replace.  I am a great Celtic Woman fan and  have already purchased my tickets for the Memphis tour next Spring, but after seeing the latest  show, I am not as excited as I once was.  I have  now received my DVD copy and after playing it several times would like to add the following comments to my original review.  As usual, the ladies are absolutely beautiful. The costumes, staging and sets were stunning but I am still not pleased with some of the songs.  However, there are enough good ones to make up for the ones I do not like.  I found the quality of the DVD to be vastly improved over previous ones and am very thankful for that.  Now, I will probably start a controversy with my next comment.  The drummers are extremely talented and their contibutions to the show's overall performance are immense.  However, why must the audience be subjected to black, hairy armpits throughout the show?  One wears a short sleeved garment and is presentable.  The other does not and at times his appearance is less than desirable.  He could wear short sleeves too and yet not hinder his performance?",1323216000,,1526,4.444043321299639
4861853,4,B005RYF5JA,Very Diappointed. I did not like having only three singers. It left a lot missing I have some other DVD's which are excellant and have watched Celtic Woman a lot but I was really disappointed in tonights program on pbs. The whole show left a lot to be desired. Of xcourse I cannot blame the girls as they are always excellant. I just wish we had the other two back. I checked onAmazon for a price. I am not sure if I will order or not. Oh well I probably will.,1323129600,2,460,4.065934065934066
4861854,4,B005RYF5JA,"Well, Celtic Woman just keeps hitting home runs.  My favorite DVD is ""Songs from the Heart"", but with that said, I have enjoyed their whole body of work and this is, as the others were, a first class performance by the girls and crew.  Lisa Lambe is a very fulfilling member replacement.  I do question some of the song selections and is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but that is subjective.  Everything said and done, I think most who have enjoyed the prior CW performances, will enjoy this one as well, I know my wife and I did. The DVD has 1 or 2 added numbers that the PBS show didn't have.",1323043200,4,600,4.146551724137931
