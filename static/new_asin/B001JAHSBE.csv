3656641,1,B001JAHSBE,"Sony, shame on you for OUTRIGHT REFUSING to release the rest of this show. As soon as Shout! Factory intervenes and releases the rest of the show you REFUSE to release, I am selling off ALL of the 5 seasons I bought from you so that I get reimbursed from the money I was suckered out of because of your obsession on not releasing the full series of shows. I say obsession because you guys only released 8 episodes of Cyborg 009 and never bothered to finish releasing the show on dvd. This is why I boycotted the dvds of Cyborg 009 in the first place as well as the dvds of Barney Miller and now I refuse to buy the first season of The Jeffersons from Sony because there is no point since Sony won't be releasing the rest of this show. That is clear now.

Shout! Factory will be getting my money for theses things.

Note to everyone: I am NOT boycotting Sony. I am only boycotting the Sony dvds of Cyborg 009, Barney Miller and now the Sony dvds of The Jeffersons.

Yes, I know that I appear to be shouting but I am really upset at Sony for doing this because I was a loyal buyer of the show The Jeffersons until Sony decided to pull this stunt. So I think the shouting is justified in this instance.

SHAME ON YOU, SONY!!!!!!!!",1313971200,18,1227,4.186440677966102

8312610,5,B001JAHSBE,"Great set. If you're a fan of the show you should have it and the other seasons. For a couple years or so they stalled at Season 6, but just this year FINALLY gave us seasons 7 and 8. I hope they're quick about giving us the remainder of the series sold individually (not the big box set) so our collections can be complete.",1443916800,3,324,4.078125
