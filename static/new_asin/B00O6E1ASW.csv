8682320,5,B00O6E1ASW,"Sheridan Smith nails Cilla Black in this 3 episode TV biopic charting the Sixties Pop Queens rise to fame and fortune. While not achieving exactitude in her vocal renditions of the songs that took Cilla to the top of the charts, Smiths performances, nonetheless, are magically evocative of that time in the lives of millions who grew up in a period before non-stop music was readily on tap and the Internet literally a pipe-dream!

The four famous mop tops and various other Mersey Beat wannabees make appearances now and again and its interesting to note the debt that Cilla owed to the Beatles in firmly establishing her career: from introducing her to Brian Epstein to penning a couple of her early hits.

The whole cast are brilliant but both Aneurin Barnard (Bobby Willis) and Ed Stoppard (Brian Epstein) deserve special mentions for capturing the spirits of their respective characters. Both men saw and heard that embryonic something special in Cilla and the series skilfully illustrates how she used and discarded both at various times to serve her own ends: perhaps all successful individuals, however talented, need that ruthless self-serving streak to make it in such a fickle and cut-throat business.

Anyone, who grew up during those times will be sure to love this and it may also serve to introduce possibly baffled younger generations to the special enchantment that made the Sixties such a magical time.",1427760000,,1420,5.008474576271187

Sheridan Smith is wonderful in the title role.  Cilla Black was a major part of the ""British Invasion"" and I'm so pleased this biopic was made about her early career.  Please release it in USA format!!",1425254400,,351,4.2727272727272725
8682322,5,B00O6E1ASW,"Having watched the series when shown on TV earlier this year, I couldn't wen brought up as a child of the 50s and 60s, wait for the DVD release and am delighted to now own a copy of this wonderful production. i have to say that in my personal opinion, this if the finest piece of television drama to be shown on British screens in many, many years. Having been brought up during the 50s/60s I was eerily transported back to the days of my youth, the sets, the entire 'feel' of the programme being so realistic and making me feel very young once again. Not only Sheridan Smith, but the entire cast were entirely believable in their roles, with Ed Stoppard giving a superb performance as the tragically tortured genius, Brian Epstein. 'Ringo' was perfect, right down to the voice and his particular mannerisms while performing. Aneurin Barnard was simply brilliant as Bobby Willis, Cilla's eventual husband, who in the early days did virtually everything to help her develop her career as a singer. This was TV drama the way it used to be, rivetting and entertaining, and certainly a dvd that I will be happy to watch over and over again. The fact that the actors all played their own instruments and sang in their own voices in some superb renditions of the music of the early 60 all added to the sheer brilliance and professionalism of this production. Without doubt, this is a fitting and brilliant tribute to one of our best known icons of the 60s. I can receommend this to anyone, whether a Cilla black fan or not!",1418601600,,1517,4.56043956043956
8682323,5,B00O6E1ASW,"This DVD has the complete TV drama, starring Sheridan Smith as Cilla White (renamed Cilla Black) and showing her rise to stardom from office typist and cloakroom girl at the Cavern to the death of Brian Epstein and her future career in television.  Along with her career is the story of her relationship to future husband Bobby Willis, brilliantly played by Aneurin Barnard, who supported her loyally throughout his life.  Those involved in making the programme are careful to document her relationship to the Beatles (she knew Ringo the longest, but there is a nod to John Lennon getting her an audition with Brian) without turning the show into just another Merseybeat story based on the Beatles, with everyone else as a side story.  This is very firmly the story of Cilla Black and it is extremely well told.  The portrayal of post-war Liverpool, with strong Catholic and Protestant divisions, austerity and real poverty is realistic and the excitement caused by a friend obtaining a pair of jeans or a young man even having a suit, let alone a car, showed what the chance of success meant for those young hopefuls.  Brian Epstein's personal problems are perhaps a little too obvious, but then time constraints probably meant that his vulnerability had to be made clearer than was actually the case, in public at least.  However, the triangle of Cilla, Bobby and Brian as the main characters works very well.  As well as the drama, there is a short bonus programme of 17 minutes, ""Cilla: The Making of an Icon"" on the DVD, which contains interviews with Sheridan and others involved in the show.  This was good enough that I wanted a copy on DVD to keep and I thought it was brilliantly done. If you have any interest in Cilla Black, the Beatles or Merseybeat, this will be of great interest to you and well worth watching.",1413072000,,1826,4.738170347003154
