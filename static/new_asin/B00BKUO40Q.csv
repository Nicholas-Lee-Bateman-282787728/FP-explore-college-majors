8570012,4,B00BKUO40Q,"This is a pretty good dvd. The episodes are very good even though they are truncated from the original twenty minute serials. They run twelve to fifteen minutes. I remember the original series when it ran in the late sixties and early seventies on local tv with Comedy Capers. The transfer to dvd is very good and clear. My only regret is they should have given the viewer the option of having the narration by Bobby and Bunny like in the episodes as the title cards are missing. The narrations helped you understand what was going on. I hope that if they release volumes four, five and six they include narrations.",1431907200,,615,4.54954954954955
