***SPOILERS***
It's about a family of vampires that survive in the modern world by living off of a blood bank that they own. One night one of the vampires is attacked in the street by a mugger and she kills him, drinks his blood and contracts AIDS. What followa is how the vampire family deals with the situation.

This film is an original and fresh look at vampire lore and is acted amazingly well by Matt Locker, Deana Demko and Cathy Loch. I didn't care for the one or two sex scenes in this, but that is a minor complaint. The special effects were decent and there is a very large cast, multiple locations and it's all handled well by director John Orrichio. If you like his style check out Dreams of the Dead and Abduction too!",1290470400,2,974,4.435754189944134
