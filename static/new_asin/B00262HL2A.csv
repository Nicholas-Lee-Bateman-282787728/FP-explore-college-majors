8351706,5,B00262HL2A,"This is superb comedy, amidst the dross that generally passes for comedy on TV. I wouldn't put The Thick of It anywhere near the same level as this, the laughs and whimsy are noticeable more by their absence with that show. The best comparison is to those evergreen gems, Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister. Like the Minister series, this show was topical, but much of it is also timeless. After recently watching it again, it's still marvelous. For an Australian, the references to B grade English celebrities usually go right past me, and it can help to have the subtitles on as the cracking dialogue can sometimes be difficult to follow. Stephen Fry gets to play the most cynical media player ever, although there is a younger bloke with the firm who runs him a very close second. If I had to single out a particular episode, it would be the one where one of the firm's clients, a soccer player, is caught in public assaulting his partner. Damage control to the maximum is essential. The firm's response is to invent a disease for their client, and turn him into a victim. It gets out of control when the new syndrome's website becomes inundated with people grateful that someone has finally put a name to their own condition.",1367539200,,1232,4.63013698630137
8351707,3,B00262HL2A,"I am a huge Stephen Fry fan.  I loved him as JEEVES, as Laurie's comedy partner in A LITTLE BIT OF FRY AND LAURIE, as Oscar Wilde in the film, as the narrator of the Harry Potter books, as a con debater, with Christopher Hitchens, up against two pro Catholics,  and in many other of his guises.  However, some of his recent tv outings do not show off his talents to best advantage.  This is one of those.  He plays a PR man with his own firm who handles one semi absurd client after another.  However, for me, the show never catches fire. Fry is just too buttoned down, too every day in this kind of role.  He doesn't do a bad job in the role.  However, I do get a sense that he is holding back all of his best stuff.  I have some of the same problems, but to a lesser extent, with his role as Peter Kingdom.

8351708,5,B00262HL2A,"Hidden within the scabarous depths of naughtiness, tarts and media-fakery that is West London's notorious Soho district, the serpentine Charles Prentiss (Stephen Fry) plots, plans, progresses and presides over the kind of duplicitous chicanery that would make Niccolo Machiavelli grin with a warm frisson of recognition and approval; a beatific smile on his cherubic face, a mobile phone in one hand and a glass of something hideously expensive in the other, Charles is a happy man who enjoys his work because, after all, he is very, very good at it. As Charles himself explains, ""I considered going into politics but then I decided that I wanted to go where the real money and power is.""

And in the spin-obsessed world of media-blitzed London in the early noughties, that would be Public Relations.

Welcome to the world of Mark Tavener's 2003 sitcom ""Absolute Power"" - a world where nothing is true and everything is permitted...or at least it is as long as the senior partner of Prentiss-McCabe (one Charles Prentiss) says it is. Ably supported by the stalwart if occasionally confused Martin McCabe (the frankly splendid John Bird), this series revolves around a virtuoso performance from Stephen Fry. I am by no means denigrating the rest of the cast with that statement - who are also resoundingly superb - but Fry's turn as the mannered, jovial and deeply perfidious Prentiss is nothing less than the finest example of Saville-row suited villainy to appear on our screens since the late, lamented Sir Ian Richardson's turn as the gloriously devious chief-whip-turned-parliamentary-predator, Francis Urquhart, in the superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Cards-Trilogy-House-of-Cards-To-Play-the-King-The-Final-Cut/dp/B00009MGGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Cards Trilogy (House of Cards / To Play the King / The Final Cut)</a>. Like Richardson as Urquhart (or, indeed, Edward Fox in Fred Zinneman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-of-the-Jackal/dp/0783226853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day of the Jackal</a>), Fry pulls off the nearly impossible task of making us root for the bad-guy and pray that his schemes will come through in all of their glory because of their intelligence and the character's charm. There is a ribald and deeply attractive honesty in his deceit because of his breath-taking insight into the machinations of power and the thought processes of the public - whether he's attempting to divert tabloid attention away from faked historical documents by engineering a sex scandal involving the faker; rigging the election of the next archbishop of Canterbury; kickstarting the inception of a branch of the countryside alliance which have, shall we say, some rather unusual political peccadilloes; salvaging the career of a wife-beating comedian or convincing the British public that a closeted politician was, in fact, looking for 'urban foxes' on London's notorious Hampstead Heath at two in the morning, one is gripped by Prentiss-McCabe's schemes in the same way that one is gripped by the plot of a cracking thriller. Kudos must go to Mark Tavener, Mark Lawson (himself a media commentator), and the coterie of other writers responsible, for the strength and subtlety of these scripts.

As a sitcom, most importantly, it is laugh-out-loud funny. Lines such as the one that make up the title of this review are thrown about with the kind of relish, split-second timing and gay abandon that can (and did) cause one to involuntarily evacuate a mouthful of tea - with the force of a Geyser at an American national park - due to laughter. The dialogue is eminently memorable and endlessly quotable - Prentiss' response to a young, female protege, after she has been sent goggle-eyed due to involuntarily discovering the depth of his latest skullduggery (""now, whilst not wanting to sound like your Uncle Albert, this'll just be our little secret, hmm?"") is a personal favourite.

I can't recommend this series highly enough if you're a fan of intelligent, subtle, nuanced British comedy. It's ownly equal in recent years is the superb satire on Blairite Parliamentary mores and doctrine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thick-Of-It-Series-1-Non-US-Format-PAL-Region-2-Import/dp/B000UXN80Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thick Of It - Series 1 [Non-US Format, PAL, Region 2, Import</a>] (which, I suspect, had more than a few Whitehall Mandarins running for cover and threatening underlings, in the manner of that series hysterically menacing Peter Capaldi, in order to find out who'd been leaking details of meetings and practices).",1247356800,,4719,5.766140602582497
