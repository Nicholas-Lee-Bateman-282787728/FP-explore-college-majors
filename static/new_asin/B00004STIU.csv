7921922,3,B00004STIU,"Watching brutal battles is far more entertaining when you know that the fighters are some of the best in the world.  You don't get that with this DVD.  In fact, you don't get much background on the fighters at all.  If you like the brutality of MMA then you'd be better off buying something else.  The superfights on this DVD were fairly good but the rest were hit and miss.  Overall, this was a good DVD to watch once (or to rent) but to own it may be a waste.",998524800,,461,4.0777777777777775
7921923,4,B00004STIU,"A lot of great fights, without any name fighters.  There are a lot of technique fights on this video, with good wins by submission.  This isn't just a couple of brawlers coming out and swinging wildly at each other (for the most part), like some small-time MMA videos.  One novel thing about this video is the lack of commentators.  The only talking is Don Wilson's quick fighter interviews before each fight.  Let me summarize: DON: ""What do you plan to do?"" FIGHTER: ""Win."" ...or...
DON: ""Are you more of a standup fighter or a grappler?"" FIGHTER: ""I'm comfortable with both.""  I was starting to think they were just playing the same clip over and over again.  Luckily, the interviews are kept short.  Oddly enough, the only name fighter, Chris Brennan, is given a 17 year old kid to fight.  Go figure.  Great tape overall with lots of action.",971222400,3,845,4.648648648648648
7921924,5,B00004STIU,"Great production, great fighters, great matchups and non-stopexcitement! With over 20 no-rules fights, lots of beautiful ringgirls, and commentary by Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson- what more could you ask for? If you like the UFC then you will love this ...",964483200,4,251,5.146341463414634
