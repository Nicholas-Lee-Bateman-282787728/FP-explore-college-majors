8227320,2,B000X9LQAG,"The description on this video is completely wrong. It NEVER discusses ANY of the topics listed in the description. It only talks about Hurricane Katrina. It was an interesting documentary, but am very disappointed that I did not get what I paid for.",1426032000,,249,4.813953488372093
8227321,5,B000X9LQAG,"This film does not really address overall preparedness in the United States. It is a chronicle of the Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath, using interviews and news clips. It was interesting but the focus is very specific to New Orleans.",1221955200,3,237,4.95
