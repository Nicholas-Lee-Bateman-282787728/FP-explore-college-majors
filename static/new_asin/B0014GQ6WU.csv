8255688,5,B0014GQ6WU,"This DVD series was great!  It starts out with basic moves and techniques and leads you step by step to more advanced moves.  I highly suggest this 6 DVD set to anyone who wants to learn more about jiu jitsu.  The product arrived very quickly and was packed very well.  Brand new, no scratches, no cracks in the case, nothing!  Also, Demian goes through each technique very thorough and explains each one several times.  He and his partner go through a series of positions and explanations to help you better understand each sequence of moves.  Overall, great product!",1208131200,9,568,4.73469387755102
