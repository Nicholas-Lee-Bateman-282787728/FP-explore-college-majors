7035525,2,B00UB95CGM,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

The Fountain of Youth and legends of that sort have interested me for as long as I can remember.  I am fascinated by the fact many of our ancestors believed in a few of these legends and some spent their whole lives searching for them.  But I had never really considered using any of them as a backdrop for a horror film.  The concept of A BLOOD STORY is interesting for sure, however the execution of this film feels lacking.  As a result, I cannot say Im overly impressed with director Joe Hollows latest release.

I really wanted to like this movie as I went into it.  I love the title, and as I mentioned, the idea is interesting.  But unfortunately there are simply too many flaws with it.

A BLOOD STORY is shot decently, although the cinematography is a bit lacking when it comes to wide-angle shots.  What I mean here is that 90% of the shots are tight, close angles that do not show much of the background or surrounding sets.  Im assuming this was done because of budget limitationsbut some diversity in the camerawork would have been nice.

The acting is not terrible, but I don't think any members of the cast will be winning any acting awards anytime soon.  Camden Toy is probably the highlight of the cast; fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (like me) will remember him as the Ubervamp.  Toy gives a chilling performance, however some of his dialogue is a bit over the top.

The special effects in A BLOOD STORY are decent, although some of the blood starts to look a bit odd after a while.  This is particularly evident during the bath scenes, where Madison is bathing in virgins blood.  Sometimes, the color of her bath looks good and realisticother times, it looks more orange than red, which makes the scene almost laughable.  This is probably me nitpicking, but I feel I have to mention it.

The storyline is probably the strongest aspect of this film.  It is intriguing and begs to be fleshed out.  But even so, it just never clicks.  There are certain things about it that don't make sense.  For example, who or what is the old hag that haunts Madisons visions?  We see her several times, but nothing is ever mentioned about her.

Overall, I have to classify A BLOOD STORY as a disappointment.  Its ok, but nothing I will recommend to you to check out.  Hopefully, director Joe Hollows next project will be better.  A BLOOD STORY is available now if you decide to give it a look.",1435536000,2,2471,4.467561521252796
7035526,4,B00UB95CGM,"One of those rare films that are about storytelling, scriptwriting, acting, character development; things we don't see very often anymore in the multi-million dollar budgeted flicks that dominate the multiplexes. The story shows a very interesting view on the legend of the fountain of youth, and once you think you understand where it is going, it takes you in a very unexpected direction. It is hard to say more about the plot without giving anything away, and this is a film that benefits from not knowing too much when you watch it for the first time. It definitely pays off to watch it more than once, because repeated viewings allow you to focus on the details on screen and in the dialogue. What I can say about Joe Hollow's film is that it is stunningly shot, with a color palette that benefits the atmosphere beautifully. The well written dialogue doesn't seem to have a word, or even a comma, too many or too few and the very fine actors really give some of their best performances.

The DVD could have been even better if a Music Only track would have been included as an extra feature, because the music is very good. Hopefully a soundtrack CD will be released some day soon.

What bothers me is the absence of actress Melanie Robel's name on the cover. Not only does she play a lead character, a key character actually, but she also does this to perfection. If you know Melanie from other films, this one will surprise you even more, because the character she plays here is something quite different to any of her other roles. Another addition to the broad spectrum of her talents.",1435104000,4,1594,4.609154929577465
7035527,3,B00UB95CGM,"The movie was surprisingly decent. I enjoyed the story as it did have some originality, which most big budget horror movies lack now a days. The characters were interesting , but not really new to what is the norm in horror movies. I liked how the movie moved at a nice pace and did not leave you bored. Acting was not bad, could have been gorier, but the story was intersting enough without it.",1434412800,5,395,4.351351351351352
7035528,3,B00UB95CGM,"Hollow's story is a stark expose of one's drive for eternal youth and beauty obtained through the darkest capabilities. Much like Elizabeth Bathory, these characters thirst for immortality, youth, and a place at the top of society's creme. The characters are a bizarre collection of Gothic personalities. ""A Blood Story"" moves pretty slow and steady with lots of melodrama and theatrics. The tone and pace of the film never really reaches the fever-pitch of thrillers or suspense horror stories, but it does pull you in with plenty of dialog and character development.

There are a few moments of horror effects that really bring to life the dark subject matter of the film. It isn't really meant to create a sense of chilling horror. The scenes are more of atmospheric macabre. Most moments that use special effects and blood are mixed with erotica so even these elements of ""A Blood Story"" stay more fantasy. Still the practical effects and horror moments are strong, quality aspects that do heighten the overall effects of this film.

 ""A Blood Story"" is a mature, fantasy horror that is reminiscent of 70's Amicus style of Gothic horror fantasy films. It does tend to stay on the more ""slow burn"" melodrama side of horror, but with such Shakespearean characters and plenty of blood washed T&A there is plenty to entertain. The film isn't going to hit any high spots with die hard horror fans that like faster paced stories filled with gore or violence. ""A Blood Story"" is a visual slice of the macabre which plays on the whole ""Bathory styled nightmare"".",1433894400,5,1558,4.871698113207547

8705197,3,B00UB95CGM,"Francis (Camden Toy) runs an Elizabeth Bathory (Debra Lamb) rejuvenation center where guests bath in the blood of virgins (looks very watery) and feasts on their flesh (scene not shown). Madison is intrigued by everything and wants to return for another session and a chance to steal old gold coins. It isn't hard to figure out in the beginning (plot spoiler?) that Francis is Ferenc Nadasdy the real husband of Elizabeth and Anna (Melanie Robel) is their daughter. Their goal is to revive the crazed Elizabeth.

Old time horror fans will enjoy the appearances of Camden Troy and Linnea Quigley who plays a woman who wants to get impregnated by her brother. Linnea appears to had some work done and looks really good. The film was low budget. The special effects consisted of the camera not showing anything. The acting was horrible, even enjoyably campy at times. Robert Z'Dar has a very bad Italian accent and absolutely murders ""capiche"" not counted as one of the movie's killings. The sound department missed a facial slap. A man is slapped, his face spins around, and there is no noise. oops.

On the plus side, the film was accurate in their historical data, except for the fact there is a death date for Anna. Thank you Joe Hollow for the fact checking. The main character in the film is Madison played by a bountiful Mindy Robinson who is not shy in this feature as she was in ""Rang 15"" as we get to see a display of her artwork.

3 stars for being ""so bad it is good"" and the nudity (Mindy Robinson, Debra Lamb) No swearing. As of this writing the film, with nude scenes, is on U-Tube. I am sure that won't last.",1472688000,,1621,4.544520547945205
