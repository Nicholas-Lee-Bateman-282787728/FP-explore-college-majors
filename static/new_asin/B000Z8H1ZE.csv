3038503,5,B000Z8H1ZE,"I love Richard Simmon's Sweatin to the Oldies 4! It is so much fun. I have been working out to Richard's DVDs for 5 months now and have lost 64 lbs. I love the music, the dancing, and the wonderful way that Richard always makes me smile. If you haven't tried this DVD then you ought to pick it up. It is a fun way to drop the pounds and get in shape.",1252540800,27,350,3.808219178082192
3038504,5,B000Z8H1ZE,"I have purchased in the last six months, Sweatin' to the Oldies 1,2, and 4.  Here is my review of each and all:  They all have fun music, people doing the ""dancing"" who make you think, ""If they can do this, so can I!"", and good workouts.  Sweatin' 1 has longer ""down"" time between the songs and the workouts are mostly not as strenuous. Sweatin' 2 has a short strength training and floor exercise section, which is helpful.  Sweatin' 4 has the most strenuous workouts.  All of these have been very helpful to me in my quest for a more fit body. Richard Simmons is really not over the top silly in any of them.  They are the earlier workout sessions when he was younger and hadn't yet identified himself and the ""court jester"" of fitness.  I have not purchased Sweatin' 3 because reviews I read said it was hard to follow.",1242432000,36,821,4.3618421052631575

3038526,5,B000Z8H1ZE,"Richard Simmons in the 80s...  I love his enthusiasm and the music. And it really does get me sweating.  The whole thing is fun and snappy.

Richard is awesome,love working out with his CD,s,he makes it fun.",1475280000,,360,4.388059701492537
3038534,5,B000Z8H1ZE,"I started doing Richard's videos in 1989 after seeing him locally (both he & I are from New Orleans).  He is unique in his approach to exercise in that he makes exercise FUN!!!  His workouts are filled with regular people, not Barbie dolls.  The music is great!
But it is his attitude that will win you over; he is so upbeat and encouraging that you can't help but smile while you dance away the fat.
I recommend all of his ""Sweatin'"" workouts.  Try one - you won't be disappointed.",1473379200,,482,4.382022471910112

This was my favorite one- it's harder than the others- more fast-paced but so energizing!! I gained all that back over the years, and 20 years later, i ordered this, along with several others and started again, this time on dvds (lol) It kicked my butt but I kept up and am on my way to losing all that again.

I have kept that 60 lbs off but have been stuck for 2 years and unable to lose anymore. However I recently started Sweatin' to the Oldies 4 and have lost another 7lbs. I am very excited and will continue to do this. The workout is fun, the music is upbeat and inspires you to keep on moving.

Sweatin' 1 has longer ""down"" time between the songs and the workouts are mostly not as strenuous. Sweatin' 2 has a short strength training and floor exercise section, which is helpful.  Sweatin' 4 has the most strenuous workouts.  All of these have been very helpful to me in my quest for a more fit body. Richard Simmons is really not over the top silly in any of them.  They are the earlier workout sessions when he was younger and hadn't yet identified himself and the ""court jester"" of fitness.

Great oldies music, although I prefer the music selection from the first three more, but the dancing is just as fun. Most of the moves are a variation of moves from the previous videos, so you should be able to pick them up quickly, especially if you've done number three. There is also an interview, a roundtable discussion, and you can see some of Richard's present students and how they've been inspired by him.

Best of all you really sweat to burn the fat!!!  I should know.  I've lost nearly thirty pounds with Richard!  Of course you have to do the work out a few times before you get the routines down pat but they are easy to learn....with maybe one exception....on the routine for ""The Wanderer"" the moves were very intricate and I just need to practice more with it but I know I will eventually have it down pat.  As RIchard would say, ""Don't give up.  You'll get there!""  God Bless Richard Simmons.",1311292800,15,655,4.260162601626016

3273240,4,B000Z8H1ZE,"The sensible thng to do would have been to stay in the vat, where it was at least cooler. But Richard, his judgement distorted by the hallucenogenic muffins,decided he had to make a break for it,leaving behind not only Madge and Vand his tiny chum mineature Poodle Rodrigo and his ""Miracle Fiber Coat"" bought for just such a situation and his sample case of fruit jellies diligently carried by hand through a variety of simmilarly dangerous if not as uncomfortable assignments any of which, with the possible exception of this he would gladly undergo again, to preserve democracy in California.

3273242,5,B000Z8H1ZE,"I have tried many workout DVDs. I have done step-aerobics, Pilates, Yogalates, Tae Bo etc.. and I have to say that this is the funnest workout video I have done. It is also effective. A couple of years ago I lost 60 lbs by changing my lifestyle, not dieting, but changing my mindset about food and exercise habits- in other words I started watching my carbs and sugars and everything else and started exercising at least 6 days a week. I have kept that 60 lbs off but have been stuck for 2 years and unable to lose anymore. However I recently started Sweatin' to the Oldies 4 and have lost another 7lbs. I am very excited and will continue to do this. The workout is fun, the music is upbeat and inspires you to keep on moving. It is also a great stress reliever after work. he keeps your arms and legs moving all the time but it doesn't get old. I would recommend this to anyone who really want to accomplish their goals.",1258761600,27,922,4.274285714285714
