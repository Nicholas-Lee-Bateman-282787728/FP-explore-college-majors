8288778,1,B001CQONLS,"I did not even finish watching this movie. It was disgusting. I had no idea it was belittling our President George W. Bush. He is among the top 10 greatest presidents of our USA. I wish I had researched the detail of the movie before purchasing it. I hated it, infact, I didn't bother to resale it... I broke it & burried it in the bottom of a garbabe bag!",1252627200,2,356,4.1
8288779,1,B001CQONLS,"Not particularly funny. For some reason, CC didn't use the great clips from Lewis Black, Jon Stewart, and many others that they have available, and instead included endless weird cartoons and lame spoofs. What a waste of $5.89.",1240704000,4,227,5.0
