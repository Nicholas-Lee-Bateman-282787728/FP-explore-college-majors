4154121,5,B003LXM1QE,"I bought the DVD for my son for his Birthday, he's a huge Will Ferrell fan.  (Although it was listed as Vol 3 & 4 on Line it only reads vol 3 on the DVD)",1360195200,,153,3.3714285714285714
4154122,4,B003LXM1QE,"Everything was great with the movie except for when it showed up, it had scratches on it because it had came loose and fallen out of the case. But it is good other than that.",1358467200,,174,4.0
4154123,5,B003LXM1QE,Ordered this DVD as a gift for a Will Ferrell lover and it was a hit! Arrived quickly as well.,1357257600,,94,3.75
4154124,2,B003LXM1QE,"Only has about 5 or 6 new skits, and the other 2/3 is already on the previous 2 volumes....can't they find new material? Even though its cheap, not worth buying.",1354665600,,161,4.4
4154125,5,B003LXM1QE,Will Ferrell is too funny. Would recommend to anyone who loves the old school SNL. Long time SNL fan.... a must get,1351123200,,115,4.2727272727272725
4154126,4,B003LXM1QE,"My husband and I definitely loved the first two volumes... This one is good but not great. If you expect the same quality as in the first two, you will prob be disappointed.",1340064000,,173,4.2727272727272725
4154127,2,B003LXM1QE,If you get SNL volume one you'll have the best.  Vol 2 and 3 are mostly repeats of Vol 1 with a new lame skits.,1336435200,7,111,3.44
4154128,5,B003LXM1QE,Love this video. You can't go wrong with Will Ferrell and SNL. Amazon had the best price when I researched other online stores including the SNL store. Fast shipment and quality product.,1327449600,,186,4.84375
4154129,2,B003LXM1QE,"I'm an SNL lover, and I enjoyed The Best of Will Ferrell volumes 1 and 2.  But this one's awful. They repeated many skits. Instead of just repeating them, though, somehow they used different versions or different takes. It is weird and less funny.

Here's what's in it. Note - there's no fast-paced montage like with most Best-of SNL collection, which is a bummer.

I've double-starred the repeats from volumes 1 and 2.

* Bush Endorsement - George W. Bush endorses Sarah Palin and the unwilling John McCain.
* Theater Monologue - A ""serious"" monologue he opens the show with.
* Goulet Ring Tones - Robert Goulet sells ring tones.
* Celebrity Jeopardy - With Bill Cosby, Sharon Osbourn and Sean Connery
* The Lawrence Welk Show - The one with the freaky girl with tiny hands
** Cheerleaders at the Chess tournament - Spartan cheerleaders. This is a slightly different version than on the other Best Ofs, with a different music for the ""perfect cheer""
** Family Dinner - ""I Drive a Dodge Stratus!"" - Another repeat here.
* NBA commentators - Ferrell is the interrupting ad for a TV show during NBA coverage.
** Drew Barrymore Inside the Actors Studio - A repeat from volume 2
* Oracle Conclave - Ferrell hosts a really awful corporate convention.
* Do You Like Luxury? - Ferrell as a strange spy.
** Get Off the Shed! - Another repeat. This one was much better in Volume 1 as one of Will's audition sketches.

Extras:
* Dress Sketch 1 - Will as a loser ghost in a haunted house, trying to scare out invading teens.
* Dress Sketch 2 - Will appears on stage with ... Green Day maybe? Some punk rock band in any case.",1281225600,57,1613,4.4727891156462585
4154130,3,B003LXM1QE,"While it has some of his recent guesting skits, I don't know why 3 skits are repeated from the 2 earlier ""Best of Will"" volumes. Cheerleader, Dinner Scene & Actor's studio are repeated. It definitely makes Vol's 1+2 better purchases. They should have tried to do a commentary track like with Amy Poehlers dvd.",1280793600,17,309,4.7407407407407405

4154133,3,B003LXM1QE,"A little disappointed with this product simply because I own Volume 1 & 2 and Volume 3 re-used 4 of the same skits that were on Volume 2... This has nothing to do with the seller; the item was received very promptly. But the item itself seems like a very poorly executed project. This isn't really Volume 3, it's more like Volume 2 1/2. But there are a few new skits on there which are pretty funny. But overrall I am disappointed with it.",1447632000,2,439,4.238095238095238

I think this was funny, but some of the skits were on volume 2 as well.
Not sure why SNL would repeat skits on 2 and 3 but they did.
You should buy all 3 volumes. These are all funny and great.",1407196800,,284,3.596774193548387

4154157,5,B003LXM1QE,Extremely Funny from Start To Finish & fan of Mr. Will Ferrell will truly appreciate the lot of comedy this DVD delivers!! Skits you will never see on TV UNCUT & Funnier then ever!! A Perfect DISC of Laughter to say the lease. Its PERFECT Not much more to say but that!!,1398902400,,270,4.211538461538462
4154158,2,B003LXM1QE,"I am very disappointed in this DVD. There are quite a few repeated skits from both Volume 1 and 2 of Will Ferrell. I am not sure why they produced Volume 3 with repeats, but it is a waste of money!",1393545600,,197,3.8292682926829267
4154159,5,B003LXM1QE,"Christmas gift for one of the people on my list, who love to make my life easier by putting choices like this on their wish list. Any Saturday Night Live would be a good choice, but I can't keep track of what everyone has, so it makes life so much easier!",1392163200,,255,4.019607843137255
4154160,5,B003LXM1QE,"Funny as always.  Of course we had to complete the set of volume one and two.  You can't really go wrong, it's Will Ferrell people.",1390953600,,131,4.2
4154161,1,B003LXM1QE,"Before I start savagely ripping apart this dvd, let me just say that it's a testament to Will Ferrell's talent and his impact on ""Saturday Night Live"" that he actually has a third volume of his supposed best work, and that he's the only former cast member thus far to have multiple volumes.

With that out of the way, this dvd is an utter turd in execution. The majority of these sketches come from his post-show cameos and his 2005 hosting gig, neither of which had Ferrell bring his A game. The ""Celebrity Jeopardy sketch and the Robert Goulet bit are shadows of his past appearances. The Bush / Palin sketch is a waste of one of ""SNL""'s best presidential impersonations. The Spartans sketch and ""Get Off the Shed"" are repeats! This is by far the laziest ""SNL"" best-of all time.

The saddest thing is that after three volumes, some of Ferrell's best stuff still hasn't been represented yet (we've had three dvd now without Neil Diamond's ""Storytellers""). If a fourth volume is inevitable, then ""SNL"" had better do their hoemwork.",1386720000,,1031,4.69060773480663
4154162,5,B003LXM1QE,"If you like SNL and you like Will Ferrell, then this is a must-have.  We have all three and love them all.  He has so many great characters that I had forgotten about some of the funny ones on this DVD.",1383177600,,202,3.902439024390244
4154163,3,B003LXM1QE,I love Will Ferrell but this Volume 3 was not that great. It had some of the old out takes from the 1st Volume and this DVD wasn't as good as the others. Sorry Will. This DVD wasn't your best work.,1378512000,4,197,3.8292682926829267
4154164,5,B003LXM1QE,Will Ferrell is hilarious and this product is a must have for any fan!  Goes well with Volume 1 and Volume 2!,1376784000,,109,3.9545454545454546
4154165,1,B003LXM1QE,Do not bother. Most of the skits have been seen already on other dvds. Nothing new here. Or what is new isn't funny. Don't waste your money.,1375401600,6,140,4.222222222222222
4154166,3,B003LXM1QE,"Good entertainment but not as funny as the previous volumes of Will Ferrell which usually

4154168,1,B003LXM1QE,"This dvd is definitely a waste of time and money. There are only a couple skits that are not on his other ones, the rest are! And theres maybe only 12-15 skits on the whole disk!",1366761600,4,178,3.9722222222222223

4154170,2,B003LXM1QE,"Given the humongous amount of skits that Will Ferrell appeared in during his SEVEN YEARS on SNL....the fact that they repeated skits from Vols 1 & 2 is inexcusable....

The skits they repeated aren't even the best ones of those same skits over the years.

Worth a rent....do not purchase.",1365120000,,288,4.74
