5562353,1,B00B7U27VW,"Nola - I am trying to find one good movie Emmy Rossum has been in since her Oscar nominated Phantom of the Opera, this wasn't it. It had a good cast except for that chick from Dances with  Wolves Mary McDonnell, totally wooden. Emmy sang and her from opera to pop didn't translate but it was better than the plot. Plot - would be hot eye candy wannabe lawyer gets madam out of trouble, girl falls for him with the promise he won't break her heart. The plot is so predictable Elmo could have penned it.",1369267200,2,501,4.21875
5562354,1,B00B7U27VW,"One star is too much, don't waste your time, im going to have nightmares.  This movie also had no concept of time.",1368662400,3,114,4.181818181818182
5562355,5,B00B7U27VW,Mary McDonnell is super in this movie!,1441411200,,38,4.571428571428571
5562356,3,B00B7U27VW,"This movie has all the blandness you'd expect from a made-for-TV, but apparently it had a theatrical release.  The plot is based on way too many coincidences, the plot elements are telegraphed (almost as if there were giant billboards with the message ""pay attention to this, it's important"", too many amazing things happen to a naive sweet young thing.  That said, it was an early effort by the incredibly cute, funny, talented Emmy Rossum and for those of us following her career, well worth the time to sit through it.  Without her, the movie wouldn't get 3 stars.  But I wish the movie was a vehicle that earned more.",1428883200,,621,4.669724770642202
5562357,1,B00B7U27VW,Terrible movie!!!,1426291200,,17,8.0
5562358,1,B00B7U27VW,"The movie is good. Charming. Four stars, but only if you don't hate things with an after-school-special feel to them. And it's awesome to hear/see Rossum sing a few tracks you can't get anywhere else. Over all the story, writing, and acting are all totally worth your time. I first saw it on Hulu and again later when I rented the disc from Netflix. I liked it well enough that I thought I'd buy a copy.

However, this DVD-R Burn-On-Demand version sucks dirty rocks. The absolutely worst video quality ever! First, it's 4:3 letter-boxed (the genuine DVD I had rented from Netflix was formatted for 16:9 televisions). Second, the video quality looks like it was shot from the back row of the theater. The product description and packaging both indicate this product is Digitally Remastered... and maybe it was, but what they have done with it in this DVD-R Burn-On-Demand version has completely destroyed it.

To their credit however... they did use a heavy, top-quality DVD case, not a flimsy light one. And the printed artwork was also top notch... heavy stock and impressive printing. Even the printing on the disc was excellent. It all conspires to make you feel like you received something really special... until you pop it in your disc player. I returned it immediately .

As I write this, the genuine DVD is still available for rental from Netflix and Hulu still has it available for streaming.

Additional rantings:
When I had ordered this product, it was described as a DVD. There were two listings for this title, the first was described as a DVD-R Burn-On-Demand and a the second described as a genuine DVD. I purchased the second. I received the first. I see now, both listing indicate they are both DVD-R Burn-On-Demand. Had I known it was a Burn-On-Demand product, I would have never ordered it in the first place. I am done with Amazon's DVD-R Burn-On-Demand junk. Of the eight or nine such products I've ordered, I've had problems with some six or seven of them. It's just not worth it. The movies are often in 4:3 letter-box format, the episodic titles often fail to play properly or are missing episodes, and nearly all display glitches/pauses/dropouts and the like during playback. But don't just take my word for it... if ever you are considering purchasing one of these DVD-R  Burn-On-Demand releases, read the reviews carefully.

5562359,1,B00B7U27VW,"This movie was horrible in my opinion. It was directed by my ex-husband's boss (they're lawyers). I went to the premiere of this when it came out in 2002 or 2003. I wanted to like it because I wanted it to be a success for the director Alan Hruska, but it was just awful.

5562363,1,B00B7U27VW,"I thought we would have here Emmy Rossum still in good voice, before she got turned into a bimbo. Well, she isn't yet a bimbo, but the movie is awful--bad acting, awful directing, a slapdash story trying to hold it all together. Don't waste your money, your time, or your self-respect by sitting down to this piece of drivel.",1411257600,,325,4.52542372881356

Unfortunately she only sings a ditty type at first for only a few seconds, and doesn't sing again till the very end, a full song.

Seriously the acting was dismal at times and they needed to do another take, but cheaped out and didn't do it.
No surprises here.
Don't waste your time.
Totally predictable.",1398643200,,251,4.6
5562378,1,B00B7U27VW,The characters were unsympathetic and the premise was entirely unrealistic. There was gratuitous violence and vulgarity from the beginning to end. I feel bad for having watched the whole way through and would recommend avoiding this one.,1398384000,2,237,5.4324324324324325

5562385,2,B00B7U27VW,Not a great story. Pretty predictable and not what I would call a romantic movie. Seemed like an old story line and the characters just updated with an edgy profiles t try and catch your interest. Not my kind of movie.,1392595200,,218,4.341463414634147
5562386,2,B00B7U27VW,"I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I had hoped to. It was supposed to be a comedy, and it was more a tragedy of bad story plot and way too many ""F"" words. I wouldn't recommend this one.",1392163200,3,187,3.7

5562390,3,B00B7U27VW,"It has some decent moments and the acting is good. Can not understand though for the life of me why they filmed it the way they did, it looks like it was filmed in the seventies and in this day and age that's unacceptable. It's an interesting story and I think it's worth watching if you want to see a feel good, light-hearted romantic comedy. Of course it is completely unrealistic which is annoying about these movies. Girl comes from small town to big city and has achieved all her dreams in a week. But that's not why we watch these movies, we watch them specifically for that reason.",1383091200,,588,4.4036697247706424
5562391,5,B00B7U27VW,this was a great movie i saw it one night on tv and just had to have the DVD. it seems the other people that have reviewed this movie and don't like it must have no taste in movies or music. EMMY ROSSUM is great in this and her singing is beautiful the other cast are great the movie was fun. watch it for yourself and don't ever listen to critics. make up your own mind don't leave it to unhappy people who thing life sucks they are never happy with any movies they watch.,1380499200,2,473,3.9894736842105263

5562394,5,B00B7U27VW,"It was really funny. Kinda weird and everything ended perfectly, you know, but good. Basically, Nola (Rossum) runs away to NYC and picks up a crazy job as an assistant to a pimp (McDonnell) while finding family and love. It's cute. Any line taken out of context is an innuendo, though, and most of the lines in context are innuendoes. It's worth watching though. I liked it.",1373068800,8,374,4.597014925373134

I think this movie may have outcheesed me! That good old ""suspension of disbelief""? Ah that was difficult at best! Too much was beyond unrealistic in this movie! Not the least of which is that the main character, Nola, is an absolute b u know what with a total chip on her shoulder AND she's alone in New York City AND she finds friends AND no one slaps her silly! Uh no. Not likely to happen. Not in the New York City of this planet anyways! Yes, it had it's cute moments but I kept asking myself why I was watching this! Funny thing - When I was done I had to look up the year it was made because from the movie itself I'd have sworn it was a mid 70's flick - no later than mid 80's for sure! But alas, no forgiveness there! It was made in 2003! If you think you cannot be outcheesed, try this movie as a challenge!",1477872000,2,963,4.1005291005291005

8563768,1,B00B7U27VW,"What in the heck is an actress the caliber of Mary McDonnell doing in this movie? Goofy, flat, predictable, poor script, poor directing, poor acting by support cast are the only ways to describe it. I would really like the 1.5 hours back it took to watch this movie waiting for MM's dynamic acting. Was really thinking, given the actress, it would be like Julie Andrews was to the Princess Diaries, but no way. I guess the other pieces were missing. So for MM fans everywhere, my guess is you will be thoroughly disappointed, the movie doesn't even begin to rise to support the caliber of her acting.

All I can say is thank god I was able to rent vs. purchasing it!",1457481600,,666,4.414634146341464
