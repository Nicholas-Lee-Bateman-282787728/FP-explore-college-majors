8576175,5,B00C1ITHX0,Wish it was sold in the U.S. Had to order fro UK and had to order a region free DVD player to watch but well worth it.,1441152000,2,118,3.4074074074074074
8576176,4,B00C1ITHX0,"Not sure if it is the player I got or the disk quality, but it isn't as clear as a DVD or blue ray.  The shows are just as good as I remember them being.  Note that you will need a different player since it won't play on the US versions.",1437696000,,237,3.627450980392157
8576177,5,B00C1ITHX0,I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!  WHY ISN'T THIS AVAILABLE FOR US??!!!  IS IT COMING??  I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR YEARS!!!!!  COME ON!!!!,1429574400,4,131,4.565217391304348
8576178,4,B00C1ITHX0,"I remember the show and have seen good reviews but format problems. PAL, NTSC or SECAM format? Here in US we use NTSC.

 I think the format should be displayed prominently in the information so you don't buy the wrong format and have to return the DVD or TAPE.",1425772800,,260,4.285714285714286
8576179,5,B00C1ITHX0,Bought this set for one of my sons.  I had to purchase a region-free DVD player to go with this set.  Why don't other countries use the same format as US?  Weren't DVD's invented in the USA?,1419638400,2,190,4.081081081081081
8576180,5,B00C1ITHX0,"Given its depth, respect for subtlety, and surprising twists and turns, it's no surprise that this late-1990s/early-200s sitcom remains relatively unsung. It's essence does not lie in the sort of instantness or gimmickry that allowed lesser shows from the same time period such as ""Sabrina, The Teenage Witch"" or ""Boy Meets World"" to have longer runs. The evolution of ""Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place"" is perhaps its most remarkable characteristic. While the first two seasons emphasized the comedic aspects of the relationships between the characters, the third and fourth ones added notable grey areas and tensions to those relationships which gave the show a definite dramatic quotientalbeit, one that was never too overbearing.

The evolution of the series is also especially redeeming because of the consistent, high-quality acting. Ryan Reynolds is indeed a pro at timing, reaction, and believability. Equally adept, and especially affecting in his emotive resonance, is Richard Ruccolo. Additionally, the unique stylings of Suzanne Cryer, Jillian Bach, Traylor Howard, and Nathan Fillion are all essential ingredients of the recipe.

As with many high-caliber shows that were worthy of longer runs, the experience of watching the final season of ""Two Guys and a Girl"" (as it was called during seasons three and four) is bittersweet in retrospect. With all the care and thought that went into character development, it would've been gratifying to see another season to further solidify the life transitions and maturations of each role. However, the writers did a fine job of carrying out the story lines in such a way that the viewer has a clear sense of the characters' defining traits and patterns after viewing the entire series.

More than a decade has passed since ""Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place"" went off the air. The plots, character dynamics, and relationship intricacies explored are just as relevant today as they were when the show was being produced. It remains a fine example of intelligent writing, expert acting, and colorful directing.",1396051200,6,2068,5.22289156626506
