*ahem* I absolutely love Fushigi Yugi, and I am currently tryng to see the entire series (even though I know the ending...) but anyways, I would like to warn people of something about the OVA's formatting.
If your like me, you probably buy a mix of subbed and dubbed tapes, pretty much anything that is available.  Well, for the OVA I bought the first tape, dubbed.  It contained episodes 1-3.  Then I bought the second tape, subtitled...and it contained episodes 5-7!  I couldn't believe it, I had TOTALLY missed episode 4 (which, btw, I didn't notice until after watching a episode 7).  So WATCH OUT, make sure you check to see what episodes are in the tapes before you buy them!

P.S: Chichiri is a cutie, eh?",1027036800,2,733,4.6

The story picks up where 'Illusions' left off with 'Taka' remembering nothing about his past life as Tamahome.  He and Miaka were able to meet again in Miaka's world (hmph) and right off the bat, weird stuff is already beginning to mar Miaka and Taka's reality (yay!)  Through some rather unusual events the two lovers find themselves back in the world of the book.  Miaka is beginning to explain to Taka that this is where they first met when a huge monster appears behind Taka and a huge flame suddenly engulfs the both of them (giggle!) The flamer turns out to be Taski and Chichiri soon follows.  He takes them all to Mt. Taikyouku where Taitskuun explains that Taka must regain all of his Jewels of Memory or he will disappear (hurrah!) After that a huge explosion rips through the mountain and the adventure begins! I recommend this tape to all Watase fans.  Keep in mind that you might want to have seen the Original Fushigi Yugi series along with Illusions otherwise you might find yourself horribly confused. This tape does have your usual Fushigi Yugi violence and cursing with a new little smattering of incest, but other than that don't worry! (oh and I'm really sorry if this review made any Tamahome/Miaka fans angry with me)",984960000,,1394,4.669387755102041
7928817,5,B00005094O,"""Those young and old have a love of anime."" --Quoting Me. Well, those two did it again! Tamahome (Taka) and Miaka manage to be sucked back into the book. The love birds much recover Taka's 7 memory balls which he had to relinquish in order to be reborn (Hense the title ""Memories"")  After facing a few problems in and out of the book--problems like possesed students, insest (not too much), and random bouts of poison sucking--the Senshi find that these are just the beginings of the problems.  One excellent sub-content is the play on Taski's feelings for Miaka...which meet a wall in the third tape.  What's the attraction to her? I mean, even Nuriko loved her...maybe it's her sense of fashion, or the fact she could eat them out of house and home.  Who knows.  This tape is a must watch, if not a must have, for all you Fushinites out there, na no da!",980812800,3,855,4.490322580645161
