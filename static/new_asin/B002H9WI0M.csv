3926847,2,B002H9WI0M,"I expected the DVDs come as a set and in their own separate DVD cases but instead I received 4 DVDs in ONE case, I didn't even know that was possible. I had to separate them and case them all myself in fear that they would some how get scratched. Every time I would open the case of 4, one or 2 DVDs would automatically fall out.",1371340800,4,329,3.925373134328358
3926848,3,B002H9WI0M,"I recently ordered a 4 disc Quadrilogy. When I received it the movies were sliding around in the case, I opened the case and the movies did not appear to be scratched but a bracket to hold the movies in place was broken. I tried to find a new case locally, no luck, I tried to order a new case but their only sold 10 to a pack or $7 shipping for a $3 case. So I contacted to merchant just to request a new case, this Quadrilogy was not for me, its a gift for someone. The merchant offered a $3 refund for the cost of the case, or for a full refund I would have to ship the movies to Germany. I thought this thing shipped to me from Jersey, Why should I pay international shipping for a broken case from Jersey. Because the time and cost to get a full refund, I just excepted the $3 and now am still searching for a case to gift these movies in.",1364515200,5,844,3.9127906976744184
3926849,1,B002H9WI0M,"So I bought this because I wanted the movies to watch, but when I bought I didn't realize it wouldn't work on my TV since it's formatted differently. I contacted the seller asking to return for a refund since I didn't realize it. I was told that since it was put on the description that it was formatted differently that I could get the refund, but I had to pay for shipping back. It cost me $47 all together to buy it, but it would cost me $127 to ship it back making me lose more money to return it. Granted they did tell me on the description, but I believe customer service comes first and the seller should make the buyer happier to hopefully return for future business, but I guess the case is different here...one thing is for sure I am not buying from here ever again. Now I got a worthless DVD that I will be lucky if I even come close to breaking even if I can even find someone who will buy it.",1351987200,8,905,4.089887640449438
3926850,3,B002H9WI0M,The 1st and 2nd movie worked fine but when we got to the 3rd and 4th movie they wouldn't play on one of our blue ray players. The blu ray player recognized that there was a disc in but we could hear it spinning and the movie would not play. We tried it on our second blu ray player and it worked. Not sure what's wrong.,1506297600,,319,3.8484848484848486

3926853,4,B002H9WI0M,"Beautiful Quality, 3 out of 4 good movies! Thought Terminator 3 had some up-scaling issues, but that was it. The first 2 though, my word, it was like watching them all over again. They were crystal clear on my 65"" 1080p TV. I would recommend this to a terminator fan that just wants to upgrade their collection.",1494460800,4,311,4.473684210526316

3926861,5,B002H9WI0M,It was a total great box of films,1463788800,,33,3.25
3926862,4,B002H9WI0M,"This all-region British Blu-ray edition of the Terminator Quadrilogy is digitally re-mastered for superior audio and video.  The audio quality for all four movies is particularly impressive.  The four-disc sets special features include audio commentaries, but no previews or making-of documentaries.

I had two problems with the second feature, Terminator 2, Judgement Day, for which I am subtracting one star.  Despite what it says on the box, the Terminator 2 disc does not include English subtitles for the hard-of-hearing.  Also, the Terminator 2 disc contains only the extended Directors Cut; the Theatrical cut is nowhere to be found.

Disc one, the original Terminator and disc three, Rise of the Machines, both contain only the theatrical versions of their features; disc four, Terminator Salvation, contains both the theatrical and extended Directors cut of that film.

As for the stories, the first two films are modern sci-fi classics that belong in every video library.  Terminator 3 and 4 were not as bad as I remembered them, particularly when all four films are viewed in succession.  I thought I remembered that Arnold Schwarzenegger does not appear at all in the fourth film.  Actually, he makes a cameo appearance as a Terminator model 101 in the climax of that film.

All in all, this set represents a true upgrade over the previously issued individual DVDs of these four films and I am glad I acquired it.  Recommended.",1461110400,19,1439,5.128755364806867

8370217,5,B002H9WI0M,"Great movie and great restoration! But sadly, had to go to the UK to get the 3D version (I know - who cares about 3D, but it's cool in 3D). Still, worth having both. I've watched this alone and with my son for years.",1522713600,,216,3.9318181818181817

My wife is hearing impaired and bought this set because it claimed to have subtitles.  If we could get the subtitles to work, we would change it from a 1 to a 5.",1515196800,,267,4.115384615384615
8370220,2,B002H9WI0M,"Glad to have gotten this set at an awesome price. I had ordered the Terminator Anthology but the item came damaged so I returned it and got this one. The set/casing was in flawless condition. Each disc (its a BluRay Set) has no issues playing.  However I must give it 2 stars after further review because the quality of T2 is not up to par. This was by far the best movie out of them all and I expected that a Blu-ray would bring out the best. In fact, the first movie seemed to be better quality. That movie was state of the art back then and Im surprised that the Blu Ray actually couldn't improve it. Could just be my copy. All the other ones were ok. This is a must have for Terminator fans. Full disclosure this set seems to be from the UK however it is region free and had no issues playing or anything else. I would recommend for a terminator enthusiast who wants a collection but as for me I think I will just look for each version digitally remastered. I want my kids to experience it fully when they get a little older.",1512518400,3,1029,4.1708542713567835
