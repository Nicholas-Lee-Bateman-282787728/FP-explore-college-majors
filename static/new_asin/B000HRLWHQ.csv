8140933,2,B000HRLWHQ,"I had hoped to have more emphasis on bones than I got; it was almost an afterthought on the DVD.  The bodhran part was also not very effective in communicating how to play, or exercises to help you become a better player.  I would have preferred less ""demonstration"" of him playing with a group, and more instruction",1200096000,9,316,4.526315789473684
