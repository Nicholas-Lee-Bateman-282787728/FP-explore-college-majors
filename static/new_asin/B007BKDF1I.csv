8513856,2,B007BKDF1I,"I bought this dvd in anticipation of my visit to the Art Institute of Chicago.  Being unfamiliar with the 1,000 Masterworks dvd series, I was disappointed to find that it featured ONLY FIVE PAINTINGS of the artists who are listed as ""actors"" under the product details.  The 50 minutes is divided into five chapters and devotes 10 minutes of discussion on each artist and one of his/her paintings on display.  Nice sharp pictures and good commentary --- OK, if you want to study those five paintings.  However, with a collection as vast as the Art Institute has, I was expecting a display of more artworks, rather than only five.",1428105600,2,628,4.73394495412844
8513857,5,B007BKDF1I,Great paintings and thoughtful commentarywhat's not to like? I especially enjoyed seeing the Callebotte again and studying its composition.  I've seen many art history DVDs and this was one of the better ones.,1365724800,4,209,5.333333333333333
