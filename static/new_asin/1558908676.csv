180431,2,1558908676,"'Titanica' documents the efforts to film and salvage some of the remains from the Titanic wreckage.  How the scientists are able to take themselves to the ship in and of itself is an interesting story, but too much time is spent on that aspect.  Tension develops as scientists argue among themselves over what artifacts should and shouldn't be brought back to the surface.  Unfortunately, that scene is about as exciting as it gets.
The history of the ship and its fateful voyage is adequately covered, but I would have enjoyed hearing more information from the two survivors who were interviewed.  Like all the IMAX DVDs, 'Titanica' ultimately suffers from being forced onto a small screen.  The information presented is somewhat useful and moderately interesting, but the small format of a television screen (no matter how large your home entertainment center stretches) just can't inspire the awe that viewers experience in an IMAX theatre.",1002758400,5,943,5.137254901960785
180432,1,1558908676,"This IMAX DVD is very disappointing.  Much of it consists of old newsreel footage and still images of the Titanic rather than the stunning IMAX photography I was expecting.  There is even quite a bit of time devoted to images of the submersible crews looking out their window and operating the subs.  If you are looking for a short, semi-documentary on the Titanic, this might appeal to you, but if you are looking for IMAX images of the ship then this DVD is a total flop.",999993600,7,473,4.476744186046512
180433,2,1558908676,"I have seen many Imax films, and this has to be one of the worst. There is not much footage of the ship, only a long winded story of her history. Also where are the extras!!!!. This film is best seen on a Imax screen and nowhere else.",984182400,3,234,3.8958333333333335
180434,3,1558908676,"I have seen 3 versions of this Imax film. The first was the 90 min long videotape version. The second was the 45 minute theatre version, (as it was shown in Australia), which was basically a cut down version of the video,  concentrating on the ocean floor and looking at the wreck, and this newly  re-edited 67 minute DVD version. When I purchased the DVD I thought I was  getting a DVD copy of the 90 min videotape version. This DVD is a  completely re-edited and updated and DIFFERENT version of both the video  and the theatrical versions I saw. The video of Titanica is a complete Imax  film. The DVD contains numerous new interviews, all shot on video(! ),  lots of old photos and film footage from the era, and while it contains  Imax film footage, it doesn't end up looking and feeling and sounding like  an Imax film. (And some of the Imax film included on this DVD is quiet  scartchy in parts). All that said, it is a good update and does tell the  story of the Titanic quiet well. Which is the main diffence between this  DVD and the video. The video tells the story of the Titanic from the point  of view of the Russian/Americam/Imax expedition sent in to film it, and  spends a lot of time on the ocean floor, the DVD is more an overall account  of the Titanic with the expedition included in the story. Its a great  supplement to the video version, but not really as good. If you can afford  it, try to get both, if not, go for the 90 minute videotape version, its  far more intersting, the comparsion of the Russian and American attitudes  to the Titanic site far more revealing and it has a lot more of that  incredible Imax footage which gives you more of the feeling of actually  being at the bottom of the Atlantic. I would have preferred to see the new  footage either added to the original cut of the 90 minute video version or  as an additional feature included on the DVD or perhaps BOTH versions could  have been included on the DVD. And nothing against Mr. Leonard Nimoy but why  was he allowed to say ""In Search Of ...""; and why did this DVD  version need to have its narration re-recorded; Cedric Smith did a fine job  on the video version.",950918400,21,2166,4.35
180435,4,1558908676,"So what if Leonardo diCaprio proclaimed ""I'm the king of the world!"" on the bow of a simulated Titanic?  With Titanica, you can see the ill-fated ship in her final resting place.  One of the most incredible  cinematic shots I have ever seen is your first view of the bow itself; on  the large IMAX screen, you suddenly feel your equilibrium go out as your  brain tells you that you're truly flying; I can guarantee Claire Danes knew  her feet were still on the deck.  While an Imax movie inevitably loses  something by getting scaled down to the small screen, Titanica is a voyage  you won't soon forget.",920160000,6,604,4.518518518518518

7795951,5,1558908676,"I remember seeing this shortly after the newest ""Titanic"" movie was released and won ""Best Movie.""  It's great showing the Titanic under the Atlantic Ocean, and with Leonard Nimoy, who we all miss, doing the explaining.",1470528000,,219,5.083333333333333
7795952,4,1558908676,"This was a decent movie showing some history and background. No new information in the movie, but not bad overall.",1398211200,,114,4.75
7795953,5,1558908676,Received DVD in mid March. Viewing the movie was very interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who likes this type of movie/documentary.  04-02-2014,1396396800,,153,5.375
7795954,5,1558908676,"My students read about the Titanic disaster. After our study, we watch this dvd. They love it! It's fun to hear the real commentary of the scientists researching and finding the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean. The students are always sitting on the edge of their seats with their mouths open!",1308528000,,296,4.60377358490566
7795955,5,1558908676,"The Titanic wreckage has lost the human and scientific meaning it should have and has become just a show. I guess that is the reason that most of reviewers gave low scores to this magnificent documentary. They just want to see the undeniable interesting scenes of the actual ship on the sea bottom. I want that too.

But Titanica is above all an excellent History of the Titanic AND its time. I think that is the best achievement of this DVD: to put the Titanic and what happened to her into an historical context so we can understand the reasons and the meaning of this human tragedy.

This said I think Leonard Nimoy narration, music and visual material are top notch. I recommend this Titanica to anyone with and interest above the understandable curiosity for the actual wreckage scenes.",1163376000,,791,4.683453237410072
7795956,3,1558908676,"I remember loving the IMAX release of Titanica, and I finally picked up the DVD.  Now, I didn't expect the visuals to match those of the big screen (that's why IMAX is what it is), but I was appalled by the ""blue-light special"" editing job.  While the original theatrical release was some 90 minutes long, this DVD was only an hour long, yet it somehow boasted ""additional footage""!  The result is a version of Titanica-lite that skips a LOT of footage, both underwater as well as biological and scientific insights courtesy of the Russian crew.  This is very, very disappointing, seeing as this now feels like half a documentary.",1081900800,7,630,4.752293577981652

7795958,1,1558908676,"Seeing as I normally ignore reviews and form my own opnion, I got burned bad here buying this DVD.  Its watchable, but nothing special.  The vaunted IMAX pictures really look nothing different than what we've seen before, and in fact spends more time above the surface or just in the debris field than actually pictures of the ship.  If there was any footage of inside the ship, I must have blinked and missed it.
About the only new thing I observed from this was how much a ghoul Ralph White is, and his comments as he wants to pillage the ship I'm amazed they didn't edit out.
Its almost worth buying this DVD to hear his Russian divemate chide him for wanting to open lugguage on the ocean floor ""But zat does not belong to you!""",1021852800,10,732,4.367647058823529
7795959,2,1558908676,"When I bought the VHS version of Titanica I was 99% certain that when I got it home and played it from start to finish there would be only a small fraction of the running time of the video actually on the ocean floor showing shots of the ship... Why do I always have to be so right?
  I knew, obviously, that the images would be very small compared with those on the big screen, but that alone would not have bothered me that much. It was the fact that about 90% of the tape showed things that occurred ON TOP OF THE WATER (getting prepared for the dive, meeting the different characters and their backgrounds, etc.), and the other 10% or so showing actual images of the Titanic below on the ocean floor that really deflated me.
  Can't SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE simply take cameras down to the ship and for a solid hour or hour-and-a-half keep the cameras rolling, surveying the entire ship for those of us who yearn to just take a slow, thorough observational tour of the ship in its entirety as it lies in the eerie depths of the North Atlantic? The scenes unfolding could be accompanied by occasional commentary/narration as to what specific points are being shown as the camera moves VERY SLOWLY about. Is this asking too much?
  Personally, I think the best video I've come across so far (can anyone recommend any other?) of the entire Titanic story, including shots of her where she lies on the ocean floor, is the National Geographic/Robert Ballard - ""Secrets of the Titanic."" I think this video has achieved the right balance of the building, voyage, and discovery of the Titanic, and the awesome photos the video has of her down at the bottom of the ocean. What do you all think?",1018483200,20,1682,4.516447368421052
