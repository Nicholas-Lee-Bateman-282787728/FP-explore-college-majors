8093470,1,B000BWCR6M,"I was taken in by the numerous good reviews of this DVD,  I watched the movie in disbelief,  firstly discovering that it was only 10 minutes long,  and secondly experiencing the plot which was something on a par with the  intellectual creation of a 10 year old with limited imagination,  spend your money on a movie that has at least something akin to a plot/storyline to offer.",1166227200,,378,4.582089552238806
8093471,1,B000BWCR6M,"This film is only 10 minutes long, and that is 12 minutes TOO LONG! Story: five men sitting around a campfire. One finishes telling a stupid story. They're bored. Another says he can top that and tells a 30 second story that is dumb, and then they all shoot each other. It takes ten minutes to tell you what I just told you. The title and description hypes this up as much more. The price is the same as many full feature films. If you've got the money to waste, go ahead and see for yourself. Acting is lame, there is no plot and reviews are deceptive. I was not impressed and give this film 10,000 stars below zero.",1160784000,,617,4.19327731092437
8093472,5,B000BWCR6M,"This is one very good film. It doesn't quit. Part satire of the ""Blair Witch Project"" and part lambasting of red state homophobia, it is a real find. If you want a new copy and Amazon does not sell it again, you can find one at dvdexpeditor.com",1142294400,4,244,4.212765957446808
8093473,5,B000BWCR6M,"After you watch this movie...in 7 days you'll be...GAY.

Not really but it's f-ing funny and worth every penny if you don't yet own it.",1130803200,5,135,4.4
8093474,5,B000BWCR6M,"What an incredible talent......The guy has mastery over comedy...and gaeity (no pun intended)....

His Columbia grad skills definately show in this body of work. The cinematography and the color choices....Strong visuals.

Great great artist....

Can't wait to see his next works",1130457600,5,279,5.7560975609756095
