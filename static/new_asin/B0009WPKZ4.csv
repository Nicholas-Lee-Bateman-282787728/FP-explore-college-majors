I can say that I own the complete original series on DVD and the show holds up great, but only having five episodes for the price makes me wanting more every time that I watch it.  The five episodes were chosen by the fans but I don't agree that they were the best, and there are so many episodes that are lacking.  I know from other umd's that the storage space is there to put more episodes on it, or even give two discs like Aeon Flux.  Some of the episodes are out of left field like Bad Seed, but the show is still great enough for me to enjoy what there is.  Fun enough for the road and something to watch, but if you want He-man i recomend the DVD set for about the same price as this.",1263686400,,852,3.9823529411764707

for me it is the best collection I've ever heared, for He-man's fans its the best 5 episodes of He-man & The Masters of the Universe part 1, you must have it, it contains:

Teela's Quest

Diamond Ray of Disappearance

Prince Adam No More

Quest for He-Man

Evilseed

I am very happy to have it on PSP UMD",1121040000,13,351,4.149253731343284
