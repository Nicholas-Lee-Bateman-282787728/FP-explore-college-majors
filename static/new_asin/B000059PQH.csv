1407781,1,B000059PQH,"Win Wenders used to be good. Films such as Wings of desire and Paris,  Texas were so beautiful that changed cinema history. But nowadays, the  truth is a bit different. Wenders has no more that feeling he used to. And  so he makes a films like this The Million ... I don't know what's more  problematic, if it is the confusing and boring screenplay or the burocratic  direction. Anyway, the result is sad. Nothing seems to work here. Even the  soundtrack is so boring. Only two songs save (The ground beneath her feet  and Falling at your feet). Now, I think nobody is the same. Wenders  un-learned how to direct and Bono forget how to sing... By the way, it was  too much for him write a song, so how could he dare to write a story for a  film? To sum up, it is sad to see how bad is the entertainment world is  going... No good films or even songs...",959558400,6,852,4.197530864197531

1407933,4,B000059PQH,As it started out I didn't like it.  But I continued to watch hoping for improvement.  You have to get involved in the lives of the characters to like it.  Which I did.  They are a weird lot.  They're fell thru the cracks.  They have formed a family and protect each other.  The end was a surprised.  Not a total surprise tho.  I had thought the one who did it was the one who did it.  I recommend it if you're the type who gets involved with a movie.  You do have to pay attention or you'll get lost easy.,1466899200,2,506,3.96

There is a suicide which may be a murder in a trashy hotel.  An FBI special agent is sent in to investigate.  Most of the hotel guests are long time residents and are rather ""eccentric.""

This movies was amazing on enough levels that I'm speechless to review it, so instead I'll just make a few observations:

I watched this movie with Amazon's ""instant video"" high-def >> TiVo, because this is (perhaps) the only HD, Panavision-shaped version of the film, and it was certainly worth the trouble.  Beautiful film and far better than the ""Starz"" transfer or what I imagine the standard-def DVD would be.

Some people have questioned how all these people could pay for their stay in the hotel; I suggest they were getting SSI checks for their insanity.  Much cheaper to pay for their seedy hotel rental than a mental hospital, and ""de-institutionalizing"" is considered the modern, humane way in America.

Others may think this odd, but this movie reminded me more than anything, of Blade Runner without the sci-fi.  Similarly quirky characters; the run-down old-school Los Angeles locations, the deep philosophical ramblings on the meaning of humanity, and the hard-boiled cop who's less human than the crazies/androids he's supposed to be policing.

When Wenders' name came on-screen at the end, I applauded even though I was the only person in the room, so I must have enjoyed it.",1362355200,,1434,4.892561983471074
1408191,1,B000059PQH,"As a huge fan of Prince, and U2, I usually go out of my way to be very kind when they dabble in the world of film. U2's soundtrack to this thing is pretty good, and sometimes great. The movie, written by U2's Bono, just may be the worst film that any musician has ever been involved with. To be worse than Prince's Graffiti Bridge takes Ed Wood type talent, and Bono and Wim Wenders somehow manage to pull this off. I have no idea what it is supposed to be about. Some guy is mumbling to some girl, and I think they live in a Hotel, but nothing in this film is made clear. I almost want to say it is so bad that it is good, but this film goes full circle a few times: It is so bad that it is good, but just when you think it is good, it is so bad that it can't be good under any circumstance. Please avoid this. Now if U2 had taken the best songs off of the soundtrack, and placed them on their future(at the time) album, All That You Can't Leave Behind....it would've been a much better album....which was still pretty good.",1303862400,,1025,4.004878048780488
1408192,2,B000059PQH,"Appearently, the classic observation that German poets muddy the waters to make them appear deep applies to film directors as well.  Basicly a silly movie for those who fancy themselves sophisticated intellectuals in need of their periodic euro-film-fix.  It wasn't even all that good as such  -- If Wenders had set it in Friedrichshain and in German rather than English it might have worked.

Wenders, Gibson and the others involved have done better work in the past and hopefully will again.",1286668800,,493,5.049382716049383

I had actually seen this movie and knew how bad it was BEFORE I bought this DVD.  I honestly bought this DVD to show my friends how bad the movie was because they couldn't believe my description of it.  I feel sorry for Mel Gibson.  I bet he wishes this movie never existed.  His role in the movie was bad at best, and was still the best actor in the movie - by far.  The movie is depressing, but not Schindler's List depressing - this is absolutely uninteresting.  There is no excitement, sadness, happiness, intelligence, etc.  This movie is absolutely devoid of any emotions at all.  It is a story of a bunch of strange, mentally ill people who live in a depressingly old hotel.  One guy jumps off of the roof and Mel Gibson tries to figure out why.  If you think you will get to enjoy a good murder mystery movie - forget it, this is no intellectual who-dunnit.  The only 10 seconds that even made me crack a half of a smile is the mentally ill guy who thinks he is John Lennon.  I finally figured out why the guy jumped off of the roof - it was because he had to watch this movie!  If you don't mind spending the money on this movie, you should buy it, just to say that you own a copy of the worst movie ever produced (I did).  After talking with several people the only other contender to this is a 12 hour long sci-fi movie with a cheesy title like ""my alien mother ate your head"" or something.  I have never seen the sci-fi movie and don't know the exact title, but I imagine it might be in the running as well as this one.  I feel like I need a Thorazine just to get through this movie without ripping my eyes out and stabbing my brain with the remote control.

1408195,5,B000059PQH,"This is one the most evocative, and curious films I've ever seen. FIrst, the score is beautiful, with original songs from U2 (Story by Bono) and other music by Jon Hassell. This artistic. fascinating film takes place at a new york  hotel with a huge assortment of odd characters, most of them poor and artistic. A death on the roof occurs, and Mel Gibson, in the strangest David Lynch like character he's ever played, shows up as an FBI agent with serious back deformities, who begins to prowl about asking questions of the oddball denizens of the hotel. Milla Jovovich turns in her best work yet, and Jeremy Davies makes the most out of a mentally challenged, yet highly animated child/man, whos bonkers over Milla, who is extremely shy and poetic in her character of Eloise.  There's a mad humor to this world, and a great mysterious romantic undercurrent. The hotel denizens gather together in their motly fashion to outwit the larger forces at bay, with Mel always aware that he is really in the company of the nutballs he grew up with. DId I mention that Bud Cort is in this film along with Peter Stormare, (Big Lebowski, Lost World) who does an uncanny voice and guitar imitation of John Lennon. Wenders casts a wonderful spell with this movie, and isn't that what you really want from movies, to be taken far away from your world by a master?

1408197,1,B000059PQH,"I thought Wim Wenders was incapable of making a bad film until I saw this. Apparently the idea was conceived by Bono of U2 (who should clearly stick to churning out pop songs). It started out well, with lots of the clever signature devices that come with a Wenders film, and had a promising cast, flagshipped by big names such as Mel Gibson and Tim Roth. However, it quickly went downhill, and before long it became apparent that whatever story lay behind the film had run its course in the first ten minutes. The remainder of the film revolved around the relationship between Tom Tom and Eloise, both of whom were clearly a couple of Lancasters short of a full squadron, and whose efforts to communicate lay in a series of grunts, twitches and slaps. No doubt this was meant to be endearing and heart-warming. In fact it was tedious and boring to the point where I wanted to bludgeon the pair of them to death with a lead pipe. I couldn't tell you how it ended, because I fell asleep long before that blessed moment came to pass.

1408211,4,B000059PQH,"I have never smiled sooo much through a 'Mystery film'.
This is a very cool movie.

Many have labeled it as an ""Artsy"" movie, to my ARTSY usually means abstract or undefined. This movie is straight forward, a guy is dead in the begining of the movie and the detective is trying to find out  who killed him or if it was suicide. Very basic, but what is NOT basic is the suspects / witnesses.

Each one is living in his own world, you have the mentaly challenged, the [...] artiest, the one who thinks he's the 5th beatle. So the enjoyment is seeing how the detective *who is just as strange as the other charecters* tries to get information out of them. So you get a little romance, and alot of smiles through this experiance.

 I personally enjoyed it, espcially with the fact that you hear Bono singing almost throught the whole movie :D

Why did I give it 4 & not 5 stars?
I was not too happy with the extra features, they did not title anyone when they are speaking, so if you don't know the names of the actors, producers ect..then your out of luck. Also the audio in the extra features was a bit unstable, low to high depeding on who is being interviewed..AND I was VERY disapointed not to find at least ONE music video for the movie from Bono, there are songs in the movie that Bono had written FOR the movie, it would have helped if they actually Interviewed Bono, since he is a co-writter in the film to give us more insight on the inspiration for this project.

Other than that, it is a very cool movie, with  a very believeable cast, I mean you actually believe this guys are NUTS, its fantastic. And for a murder/thriller, it actually dosen't have that much violence or blood in it...but alot of smiles.",1152057600,3,1714,4.334375

If not consider as a huge barroque comedy. Fellini in USA, with characters completely out of their mind and the situation may be seen under this approach but no more.

I understand some of the concepts Bono was trying to work with (especially when you imagine Winona Ryder, their original choice, in the Milla Jovovich's role), but overall this movie was boring, directionless, and nonsensical.  I wish I could say otherwise, believe me.  But it failed to captivate me at all. I was sort of embarrassed for everyone involved.",1108166400,4,668,4.5

But originality doesn't always make an entertaining film.  What's the whole point of the movie:  that the mentally challenged can fall in love too?  To allow Wenders to wield his cinematic sword and make lovely looking scenes, and to give Bono another chance to try and show us he is not just a rock star?

Some of the movie has some wonderful moments, and yes the romance between Tom Tom and Eloise is touching in its different approach.  Jeremy Davies gives a tremendous performance as Tom Tom, which is why I give the movie three stars.  His portrayal of the ""idiot"" is so on target one forgets he's acting.  Milla Jovovich should stick to the Resident Evil movies; her waifishness seemed forced and her character too off the wall to be believable.  Gloria Stuart, that lovely elderly lady who came back to the cinematic world's attention in TITANIC, seems to be used merely to spout four letter obscenities to show that foul language is cool for the octogenarian set.  Jimmy Smits and Bud Cort offer support, but their characters are too underdeveloped to really impact the movie.  That leaves us Mel Gibson in probably his most unusual role.  While he infuses some manic intensity in the role of the FBI agent who had an arm removed from his back (come on writers, let's not test the waters too much), overall he merely seems to be doing a favor for Wenders and Bono.

Cryptic and overblown, MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL did not make a wave in theatres; I can understand why.  Good job, though, Jeremy.",1105920000,8,1739,4.637254901960785

A group of freaks, junkies, mentally deficient people, [prostitutes], people without money, people without expectations, etc. In other words, the other side of the coin of the ""American Dream"". Yet, just like in a Fellini movie, we are made to watch, and somehow understand them, and like them and love them. They are much better adapted to their ""underprivileged"" world than we are to ours. They have the magic of life in them. This movie is a great Love Story in many different levels. It is also, a movie about friendship, passion, greed, jelousy, hate, revenge, etc. On a personal level, on a HUMAN level. Certainly it puts us (""The Privileged"", with our diregard for others, our consummerism, our wars, our weapons, our fears, our hatreds)to shame.

It is such a powerful and smart movie that strings love, sadness, and their once-ness in life together. Music by Bono is also great. If you like Wenders, it is a must-see. If you do not like Mel Gibson in his usual role, then you will find it amusing. At any rate, do not trust the ad. on VHS/DVD...

Of course many find the plot ""too complicated"" or ""boring"" but most of you should realize that those are the people that love movies where all the hard parts are spelled out so you don't have to think. This movie is thought provoking and after a few viewings you begin to pick up on more of the plot.
I  can't possibly find why many have said the acting is horrible, Milla Jovavich and Jeremy Davies play very creative and supportive roles to each other. It's obvious it's not Mel Gibson's best role but the script wasn't written for him to be the leading star. If anyone would take the time to look into more of the story behind this film (other than the DVD extras) they'd appreciate it more. The atmosphere and tone set in the movie create a chilling emotion, which the music matches quite successfully. If you're a fan of U2 then you should appreciate the soundtrack, although it's a lot less complex (than any other U2 stuff) and something to listen to on a rainy day, it's good music. I listened to the music before I saw the movie and I enjoyed it.
Overall the movie is good. It's not the best movie I've ever seen but I really like the mood you get from it. In my opinion you should see it for yourself. If you're really scared about wasting a few hours then maybe you should find other things to do with your busy life than watch movies.

1408253,3,B000059PQH,"Written and co-produced by U2's Bono and directed by Wim Wenders, MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL is more a movie for film students to analyze and nitpick over than for casual viewers.
In one of his most bizzare (and best) roles Mel Gibson plays FBI agent JD Skinner, who is investigating the suicide/ possible murder of  a billionaire (Tim Roth) in a run down hotel. He must try to deduce who the killer is among the hotel's bizzare guests. He enlists the help of the victims mentally ill best friend Todd (Jeremy Davies) to be his partner. TomTom also is one of the hotel patrons and he drags his equally unwell girlfriend Eloise (Milla Jovovich) into the picture. Among the suspects are a John Lennon wannabe, complete with Liverpool accent (Donal Logue)and a wacko American Indian,  Israel ""Geronimo"" Goldkiss (Jimmy Smits). Other familiar faces to appear among the guests include Amanda Plummer and Julian Sands. But what Skinner doesn't realize is that Todd has set him up and is getting the guests to throw all manner of red herrings into the investigation.
MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL has an effectively dark noirish setting and aspires to be a modern day SUNSET BLVD. or MALTESE FALCON but it misses the mark. The first half of the film is stylish but icy and pretentious, the second (and more absorbing) half gives the viewer the chance to have more involvement with the characters.

I'd watch Milla stare into the camera for 2 hours and give it 5 stars. However there is one thing I really need to know about this film. I'm wondering if anyone else picked up on it and wether it was planned or just a fluke. The first time Eloise walks into the book store she picks up about 4 or 5 paperbacks and the one on the top caught my eye immediately, because it's unmistakebly Carlos Castasneda's ""A Seperate Reality"". I have been a Castaneda devotee for many years. So I'm just curious as to who's idea this was, because I honestly don't think it was a fluke.

Wenders focuses his sweet, gentle, character-revealing techniques on a cast of deranged, distasteful characters; we get to really like them, and really dislike them. It's a hodge-podge of magical realism, detective story, romance, and farce. It mixes stunning visuals with the filthy underbelly of L.A.
It's not typical Gibson, Bono, Jovovich, or Wenders, although it's arguably more Wenders than anything else.

It is novelistic in characterization and nuance, not pop trash like the majority of films... which may explain why it received very limited theatrical release in the U.S.  The story, though, is simple enough: it is a love story.  And a murder mystery.  What isn't so simple is its self-reflexive nature, and this is where things get interesting.  The actors play characters who are in turn playing roles.  Milla Jovovich's Eloise announces early on ""I'm not real. I'm fictional"".  Identity is a construct, it is armor against a very harsh world.  It is a very imperfect armor, and then there is the need, the desire, to let the other person inside.  Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) and Eloise play this game, dance this dance.  It is very touching.
Wim Wenders knows how to get the best from his actors.  Davies and Jovovich are outstanding.  Wender's method appears to be to let the camera run forever, giving the actors an extroadinary amount of breathing room.  As in his ""Paris, Texas"" the result is very natural scenes that look completely unscripted.  There are long silences, long pauses that communicate... the way people communicate in their daily lives.
The movie's soundtrack by U2 is, not surprisingly, terrific (the CD is well worth getting, as well as the movie).
The only disappointment of this film is Mel Gibson's performance.  He seems never to get a handle on his character.  Perhaps the role was simply beyond his acting ability (demonstrating once again that there is a difference between being an actor and being a movie star).  Perhaps his nose was put out of joint by having to play second fiddle to someone of Jeremy Davies' meagre fame.

million dollar hotel is a film about an old dilapidated hotel whose residents are mentally unstable.  they find themselves in a bind when they find out one of them has been murdered but no one knows who did it.
tom tom(jeremy davies) is a character you instantly feel for from his the first scene when he jumps off the building in spectacular fashion and says, ""after i jumped, i realized...life is the best.""  in some respects, you almost envy him for realizing this, but pity him at the same time for finding this out too late.
milla jovovich has an equally curious role.  she plays a strung out woman who finds herself reading romance novels all day at a used bookstore and prostitutes herself at night. jovovich plays almost the same role as davies, but at the same time, much different.  it's no wonder he finds himself chasing her through the whole movie and nearly getting what he wanted...her.
mel gibson plays a secondary role in this film, as he should, as a detective who happens to be a ""freak"" just like the people he is investigating.  million dollar hotel is definitely not for someone looking for another stereotypical mel gibson flick as it is a far cry from lethal weapon and what women want...lucky for all of us.
the movie as a whole is one of the best i have ever seen.  it is a shame it was not given much publicity in the states as it was in europe.  it was co-produced by U2 frontman Bono who also, along with the rest of the band, creates a dark, but excellent, soundtrack that complements the movie like no other.

The plot is fragmented, the stories are crudely stuck together and the acting is sub-par.  Milla Jovovich is fun to look at, like always, but apart from her startlingly sharp cheekbones and piercing eyes, she is pretty well glamoured down.

You should be able to figure out the situation behind this movie without even watching it.  It is a 2001 release that most people have never heard of.  A film released straight to video with Mel Gibson?  How could a studio do that to a film with such a marketable star?  Remember movie executives are there to make money, if they thought there was anything even remotely worthwhile in this film then it must have been horrible.  It is.
The movie drags along under the narration of Jeremy Davies' character, Tom-Tom.  The lines don't explain anything, are often repetitive, and are often whispered for the sake of generating some atmosphere.  The only thing they suceed in generating is annoyance.

Jeremy Davies is breathtaking as Tom-Tom.  He literally dances his part with springs and leaps substituting for steps, and gestures borrowed from a Japanese Kabuki play.  His portrayal of a mentally-challenged person is pure cinematic poetry.  The love story is very simple, very pure, very odd, but totally engaging.  Mel Gibson as the ex-freak who used to have a hand growing out of his back must have wanted to work with Wim Wenders.  We lose much of the humor we usually get from his performances.  Amanda Plummer and Bud Cort as two of the residents of Million Dollar Hotel shine.  Plummer is particularly touching as she goes up to the millionaire father of the dead man and introduces herself as his fiance by throwing her arms around him and saying, ""Dad!""  Jimmy Smits was on holiday in the movie as Geronimo, the artist who paints in tar and tries to scam the art world.  Wenders' stately style gives a sense of poetry to the mentally ill.  The film might seem to drag a bit.  Davies' performance and the bizarre editing cuts propel the film.  Bono's soundtrack blends well.

1408319,3,B000059PQH,"This is a quirky movie with a first rate cast and a muddled story.  This story like many of Wim Wenders tails is about the character interactions with each other in unusual circumstances.  You could not ask for a better selection of odd balls to be in one movie, all of which were acted to perfection.  It's the story that holds the characters together that required more development.
The lead character, Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) was an innocent child-like person with no interactive social skills but being someone who gives away everything he has until there is nothing left.  He is in love with Eloise (Milla Jovovich) but it is the love of a small child that is only looking for recognition and has only a slight sexual element.  The story takes place in a hotel that is filled with mental outpatients and society misfits who all have some delusion they are living under which takes up most of their lives.  A stiffed back FBI man, played to the hilt by Mel Gibson, comes in to investigate the possible murder of one of the tenants and upsets the delicate balance of this on-the-edge environment.  Every part of this ensemble cast is played to perfection by a group of artists (Jimmy Smits, Peter Storemare, Amanda Plummer, Gloria Stuart, Bud Cort and Julian Sands) that is the strong point of the movie.  Anybody studying acting should make this a highlight picture to go onto a greatest hit list.  Every role is a little gem.  The problem here is that the total was less than the sum of its parts.  The story holding all of these off-the-edge players has major flaws like broadcasting a confession tape over public TV before an arrest or the FBI breaking all the rules in public plus many more.  One major point is the fact that all of these completely crazy people can have organized meetings to discuss strategy and arrive at some semblance of a result.  I wish some of the corporate meetings I have to attend were so clear-cut.  These obvious flaws serve to damage this very complex plot. You are introduced to the characters through the process of an investigation one by one and they are played against each other by the FBI man but taken all together the resulting outcome losses its cohesion.  The people were very complex yet the complex plot became fragmented.  The story and soundtrack written by Bono of U2 is a much better soundtrack than story.
A good movie for acting students and a look into a story line where this microcosm society is taking advantage of innocent but not a movie I would like to watch again.",993945600,3,2530,4.613839285714286

Mel Gibson is good too, helped with a back brace.  Peter Stormare makes a great nut who thinks he was in the Beatles.  Some people hate discombobulated quirky flicks like this but I would take this any day over something like Gladiator or Titanic.

I am a huge U2 fan, but the music was downright dull.  It all sounded like the same song over and over again, and as the person I was watching the movie with stated, it was filled with Bono's masturbatory musical moments (ie. unnecessary musical vignettes during a scene, lyrics that were dour, dull and pretty much unrelated to the action, etc.)
I am a HUGE Mel Gibson fan, and love Jimmy Smits, but both of their performances were mediocre, at best.  It surely had more to do with an uninspired (and uninspiring) script than any shortcomings of theirs.
I won't give away the big mystery behind Mel's neck brace, but it was the most ridiculous plot twist (if you could call it that?!?) I've ever been subjected to.

Mel must have owed somebody a HUGE favor for him to take the role of Agent Skinner (X-Files anyone?).  This film had NO basis in reality.  The story was weak, boring, and had NO point whatsoever.  The Acting was HORRIBLE.  I have NEVER seen a group of actors looking like they COULDN'T WAIT for the filming to end.  Mel Gibson was absolutely TERRIBLE.  I was truly AMAZED that there were actual Human Beings that ENJOYED this film.  I read the previously printed reviews and was in utter unbelief.  I mean I've enjoyed my share of BAD movies (like HOUSE and HOUSE 2), but at least those Movies had a little fun on their way to the Movie Trash Bin.  I really don't understand WHY this film was made OR how it even survived the DVD Transfer (it should've melted as it recorded).  I have to say this is probably THE worst Movie I have EVER seen in my life.  I thought it was a Movie called SPIDERS (you can read my Review of that one right here at Amazon.com), but, to my disbelief (and dismay) Hollywood has actually produced another Raspberry Award Nominee.  My only regret about this review is that I HAD to give it at least ONE STAR.  Please forgive me; it deserves ZERO!!!",991440000,6,1299,4.354166666666667
1408346,3,B000059PQH,"It is tempting to pick up this film, as I did, because it stars Mel Gibson.  If that is your motivation, think very carefully.  Mel gives one of his less memorable performances and is more of an ensemble cast member than a lead actor in this film.  Director Wim Wenders is considered by many to be one of Europe's best directors.  This film offers numerous examples of that, but while it is an interesting character study of some very disturbed people, the story is so flimsy that the excellent acting and directing still can't prop it up.
The story brings us a slice of the lives of some very mentally challenged people who live in a run down hotel. It is narrated by one of the characters as he plunges toward the ground after having leapt from the roof.  FBI Detective Skinner (Mel Gibson) is investigating the death of Izzy Goldkiss, an artist (Tim Roth) who lived in the hotel.  Izzy also plummetted to his death from the roof of the hotel.  Everyone but Skinner thinks it was a suicide.
Along the way we are subjected to the bizarre behavior of the residents of a loony bin without bars.  It is like watching ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" without the storyline.  We are treated to flamboyantly odd people, but we lack a reason for watching them and the novelty wears off quickly.  The dominant theme is the love story between Eloise (Milla Jovovich) and Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies), who is our plunging narrator.  This relationship is heartrending, but it is not enough to save the film.  Though all the characters are colorfully portrayed, the uneven presentation does little more than make a case for the institutionalization of the mentally impaired.
The acting by the ensemble cast is terrific.  Milla Jovovich took this part fresh from her role as Joan of Arc in ""The Messenger"".  Her portrayal of Joan was controversial because she played her as a borderline lunatic (and did so brilliantly).  That experience served her well in this film, and it establishes Jovovich as one of the better depicters of the mentally bereft.  Unfortunately, there are not enough such parts to warrant abandoning her modeling career.  Jeremy Davies is the brightest spot in the cast with a wonderfully quirky performance.  Jimmy Smits takes a delightful plunge into murky waters with an over the top portrayal of Geronimo, an Hispanic ""Indian"".  Smits is terrific at the straight macho roles he usually plays, but this is quite a departure.  He does a fabulous job and it is so incongruous to see him in the role that it is fun to watch.
I'm not sure why Mel Gibson took this role.  He has played some offbeat characters, but this one is off the chart.  It was more of a caricature than a character.  After the film opened, in a gesture of actor's remorse he publicly badmouthed the film to anyone who would publish his remarks.  That was not a class maneuver.  He should have been a professional and refrained from comment.
This is an interesting character study that is about thirty minutes more madness than the average viewer should be required to bear.  I rated it a 6/10 despite the weak story because of the strength of the acting.  It's worth a look for Wenders fans, but Gibson fans steer clear.",989193600,9,3196,4.660714285714286
1408347,5,B000059PQH,"A lot of the critics hated this movie.  God, weren't they paying attention!!!!  Granted, you really do need to pay attention to catch all the nuances, to understand the relationships, to *get* what Eloise has to do with Izzy falling/being pushed off of the roof in the first place.
It's odd that such a hauntingly beautiful film can be so sad and so uplifting at the same time.  This movie is full of quirky characters, it visually stunning and the music is great.  Beyond that it's a great commentary on life and values, love and the way humans screw things up.  I found myself thinking about this film for hours after I watched it.  Then I couldn't wait to watch it again so that I could catch all the nuances I missed the first time through.  This is one of those movies that makes you think about life, about living, about appreciating what we have and how our preceptions about what it is we think we have colors our experiences.  It's also hilarious.
There are few movies I ever bother to watch more than once.  Even fewer that I care to own.  This is one of the exceptions.  I'm going to have to buy myself a copy, because like any good art, the full beauty of it can only be properly savored through repeated exposure.",989107200,3,1226,4.404444444444445

I don't even know if it is a good movie or a bad movie; certainly it is a creative, imaginative work that is full of life. It defines itself completely on it's own terms. It isn't a movie so much as an experience. It's a poem. It's a quirky little film. It is a song with classy tidbits of wit, political/social commentary, art farce, and human insight just tossed off as incidental. Certainly, the movie haunts you.  The pace is slow, it's true. Skinner is a complete mystery. The lines that annoy some of the professional reviewers are my favorites: ""Izzy"". ""Izzy what?"", just so cool ! or TomTom saying: ""I'd like to read a book but I can't decide which one."" Offbeat humor at its finest. Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it.

1408349,1,B000059PQH,"Whilst flicking through the new releases listings I noticed that this film had received cracking reviews and ratings from other Amazon shoppers, this alarmed me so much that I felt my opinion should be heard (something I don't usually do).
I believe that everybody has their ""Do not, no matter what, go and see this film"" story, which you will tell your friends and colleagues and even have a bit of a chuckle about it. I went to see Million Dollar Hotel during its theatrical release here in the UK.
A film requires characters that are slightly likeable... This film sadly has none. I also believe that a film requires a screenplay that has some substance to it, hell it might even overpower the terrible characters, but again this film is incredibly lacking in this facet.
So a film which has characters and a story that are both neither interesting nor attractive, I then continue to tell you why you should not see this film. I believe that a film can be very stylised and very cool, I love the Coen Bros., Gilliam and Kubrick, all who perform their stylising very well, sadly I felt that this film tried too hard and it looked poo, the dirtiness annoyed me, Jovovich's character was sooo flaky it was untrue, the lead character Tom-Tom (Jeremy Davies) was intensely irritating, believe it or not Gibson was the only actor that provided some clean relief and I hope that this is a film that Roth will never admit that he was ever involved in.
A film of such poor substance is generally forgivable if it has loads of explosions, special effects, fighting etc. but, you guessed it, it doesn't, just a crappy film that will please such a small minority of Wim Wenders fans it really shouldn't have been made.
Other than all of the above shortcomings it has more, YES MORE, reasons why you shouldn't see this movie, from the opening credits it was obvious that Bono had been significantly involved in this movies production, from score to cameo's, all of this gave the film a feel of a Bono music video, a crap music video, with a poor story behind it. 15 minutes into themovie and any intelligent person will be able to tell that this film is not going to get any better.
Please, for your own sake do not watch this film, to quote Delroy Lindo in get shorty ""I have seen better film on teeth.""
Please do not watch it to see how bad it is, it really, really sucks! then again you will always need something bad to compare the good to I suppose.",987638400,7,2444,4.49438202247191

1408352,5,B000059PQH,"There's been a lot of debating over whether or not this film deserves its Berlin Silver Bear award. In my mind it deserves more than that, for this  is truly a remarkable film.
The Million Dollar Hotel is a home for  outcasts and mentally unstable people. Once it was probably a high-class  place, but time has taken its toll and it is now merely a parody of itself.  Inhabitants include a mad Indian Chief wannabe (played by Jimmy Smits), a  guy who thinks he's a member of the Beatles (hilariously played by Peter  Stormare) the retarded ""hero"" of the story Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) and the  shadowy, silent Elouise (Milla Jovovich) who he has a serious crush on.  One day Tom Tom's nearest friend fall off the roof of the hotel, and foul  play is suspected. It is then up to an FBI Special Agent (Mel Gibson) to  find the murderer. This is no easy task indeed!
What sets this movie  apart from the mainstream is that it oozes atmosphere and that is dares to  be *different*. Director Wim Wenders has taken the story by none other than  Bono from U2 and worked his magic on it. The result is a visually stunning  film with some of the most intense moments I've ever seen. Add the amazing  soundtrack, also by Bono, and the excellent performances by all actors and  the result should be obvious: an instant classic.
Bear in mind, though,  that this is my opinion of the movie. It is shared by a couple of my  friends, but other reviewers have strongly criticised the film. I fail to  see why, but it just seems to be one of those movies that people either  love or hate. In any case I strongly recommend seeing it, if only to  experience its intense, sad beauty. This is indeed no cheerful film, but it  does have its fair share of funny quirky moments.
