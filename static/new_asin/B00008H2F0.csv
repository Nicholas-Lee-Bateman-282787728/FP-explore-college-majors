CONTENTS of REAL STORIES OF THE OLD WEST 4 Movie Pack:

CRAZY HORSE AND CUSTER-- Complete fiction. Patched-together episodes of a short-lived 1967 TV series (""Custer""). Featured in the cast is Peter Palmer, whose first film role was the title character in the screen adaptation of the Broadway musical, ""Li'l Abner.""

DANIEL BOONE, TRAIL BLAZER-- Boone and his group of settlers face violent resistance from Pawnees who have been wrongly told by a French renegade that the newcomers intend to kill the Indians and steal their land.

SITTING BULL-- L.A.'s Iverson Ranch stands in for the hilly Montana country where Custer's Last Stand occurred. A cavalry major and the chief of the Sioux nation together attempt to avert the coming battle. Portraying Crazy Horse is Iron Eyes Cody, who once perjured himself in court by claiming to be Native American. Cody was in reality the son of Italian immigrants.

WANTED: THE SUNDANCE WOMAN-- Etta Place, the Sundance Kid's widow, joins up with Pancho Villa. Katherine Ross was also Etta in the 1969 Newman/Redford Butch & Sundance movie. Good cast in this made-for-TVer.
