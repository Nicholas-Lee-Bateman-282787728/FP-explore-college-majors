8382258,5,B002VKNNHO,"If you love the Civil War, the times of Abraham Lincoln, or are an armchair reader, you will thoroughly enjoy this program.  Great for homeschooling and classroom use too.  Covers the battle of Gettysburg and also includes a live re-enactment bonus track as well as a clever historical archive film about locals who comment on Lincolns Address - very entertaining.",1257811200,,364,5.05
