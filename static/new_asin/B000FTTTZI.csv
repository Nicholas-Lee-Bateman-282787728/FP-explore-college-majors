8126566,2,B000FTTTZI,"I paid for an infomorcial ! This was an ad ! He's selling garbage ! What a waste , I never enjoy watching someone who thinks they are soo talented either . I would not recommend this video to anyone except ronco . . . maybe ginzu  but no one else .",1396656000,5,248,3.769230769230769
8126567,2,B000FTTTZI,I bought this thinking I would learn something. Very little info unless you are a novice or new artist. At least 10 minutes at start selling the canvas board and 10 minutes at end where he actually says he is talking to retailers of the Fredrix board and how to sell them. REally not educational in my opinion but a sales demonstration of the canvas board. And the secrets are a joke as anyone who paints can tell you these. Would NOT recommend to anyone. Sorry I spend the money on Ebay.,1389744000,4,488,4.315217391304348
8126568,4,B000FTTTZI,"This is a great introduction for anyone who has never used watercolor canvas. He gives many good tips and techniques in the use of watercolor on this type of canvas. I gave it 4 stars because there was little information on finishing/varnishing the canvas. All he mentioned is (spray 3 times with an acrylic), that was it. But since this is a new way of doing watercolor, (which I consider fantastic), you are better off experimenting. I use Golden Archival sprays for finishing. The DVD works well if you have Windows 8.",1384128000,3,521,4.673913043478261
8126569,5,B000FTTTZI,Very instructional.  I have painted on canvas and used the tips and procedures and have really enjoyed this new way to paint with water colors.,1374278400,,143,4.72
8126570,5,B000FTTTZI,"Tom Lynch is a great instructor.  In this video, he details step by step how to paint on a watercolor canvas.  The video is just the right length ... not too short, not too long.  He completes an entire painting, from start to finish with many helpful hints as he goes along.  You do not have to change your way of painting to find this video helpful.  I highly recommend this instructional video.",1253318400,9,397,4.383561643835616
