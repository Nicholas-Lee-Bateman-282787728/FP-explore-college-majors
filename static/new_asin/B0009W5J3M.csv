2326467,5,B0009W5J3M,"Out of the 7 seasons of MacGyver, this one is by far the best overall.  If you are only going to buy one season this one is for you.  The first season set the stage for the show and the second season developed the character of MacGyver, now in the third season the writers really hit their stride.  One stroke of genius is the introduction of Nikki Carpenter, a strong female with a mind of her own who butts heads with MacGyver every chance she gets.  She drives Mac nuts which creates some great scenes between the two of them as the season goes on.  They originally wanted her to be a love interest for MacGyver (she is played by the same girl who is in ""Lost Love 1 & 2"" at the beginning of the season) but they really didn't have that kind of chemistry.  It is more of a brother sister kind of thing so she eventually leaves the show.  Also in this season Jack Dalton returns for 5 episodes as does Murdoc in the one of the shows best episodes ever, ""The Widowmaker"".  We get to see MacGyver's soft side when he finds a baby and his rough side when he coaches a hockey team.  We also get to meet the many loves of MacGyver that always never quite work out.  Overall, season 3 is the best season ever.  Season 4 which will hopefully be out by Christmas comes in a close second.",1121731200,24,1281,4.166666666666667
2326468,5,B0009W5J3M,"A unique and different kind of TV action series, MacGyver made its television premiere in the Fall of 1985 to much fanfare. Audiences immediately responded to the title character and his unusual penchant for turning everyday items like chewing gum and paperclips into elaborate life-saving contraptions. In this way, it maintained a slight resemblance to The A-Team, and this recurring plot device helped MacGyver build a strong cult following...

Richard Dean Anderson plays the title role of MacGyver, an energetic employee of the fictional Phoenix Foundation for Research. An unorthodox hero by action series standards, MacGyver has a deadly fear of heights. A pacifist who refuses to use weapons, he relies heavily on his ability to use his brain and tinker with the various materials at his disposal. MacGyver's best friend, and the director of the Phoenix Foundation, is Pete Thornton (Dana Elcar). Pete often sends MacGyver on Foundation missions and sometimes comes to his aid (usually after MacGyver has saved the day). In addition, MacGyver is joined on a regular basis by his airplane pilot friend Jack Dalton (Bruce McGill), a man who constantly entangles himself in illegal activities and other troublesome situations. Between the usual slew of bad guys, the vendetta of archenemy Murdoc (Michael Des Barres), and his multitude of troublesome friends, MacGyver is always in the midst of interesting and dangerous events, and the show's true entertainment value derives from watching MacGyver's distinctive method of dealing with each one...

The MacGyver (Season 3) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere ""Lost Love"" in which a woman from MacGyver's past (a woman he once loved) returns to his life. She also happens to be a known Soviet dissident who begs for his help in aiding her escape from the evil regime. But before MacGyver can help, the KGB kidnaps her and demands a priceless artifact as her ransom, leaving MacGyver as the only man who can save her... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Widowmaker"" in which MacGyver mourns the death of his friend at the hands of a former enemy, and ""Mask of the Wolf"" in which Jack and MacGyver aid in the search for an ancient Indian wolf mask while two mercenaries follow their trail...

Below is a list of episodes included on the MacGyver (Season 3) DVD:

2326469,5,B0009W5J3M,"With the first two seasons having recently come out on DVD barebones with no extras, don't hold your breath for this third season release. Nonetheless, the quality of the show itself is what really matters, not that of the package. There were a total of 20 episodes produced for this season, and the set has been announced as a 5-Disc collection, following the slim packaging established with the second season set. Richard Dean Anderson is great as the witty MacGyver, who uses his knowledge of things around him as a means of escaping the dreary situations he has to overcome in every episode. Dana Elcar is also fantastic as Peter Thornton, MacGyver's boss at the Phoenix Foundation, and also his best friend. The episodes that will be included in this set are: Lost Love- Part One, Lost Love- Part Two, Back From the Dead, Ghost Ship, Fire and Ice, GX-1, Jack in the Box, The Widowmaker, Hell Week, Blow Out, Kill Zone, Early Retirement, Thin Ice, The Odd Triple, The Negotiator, The Spoilers, Mask of the Wolf, Rock the Cradle, The Endangered, and finally Murderer's Sky. Hopefully Paramount will release the remaining four seasons on DVD soon, and maybe someday we will see extras in future sets.",1118448000,41,1202,4.811594202898551

2326523,1,B0009W5J3M,"The one star has nothing to do with the tv series itself which is of course five star great, but has everything to do with picture quality.  Specifically I'm talking about the poor transfer quality resulting in pixelation in places.  I haven't seen it in the other seasons yet which look good.  For example, in the 'The Widowmaker' when Nikki visits Mac at the lake cabin, the bumper of her vehicle is pixelated in parts.  When she walks from her vehicle to the cabin, it looks as though there is a pixel party happening on the cabin roof.  Its really disappointing to see the pixelation and poor picture quality.",1397606400,,613,4.587155963302752

The show is everything we loved and remembered, after all no one else in the world can turn a pile of seemingly normal items found in a room into an explosive device!

2326558,5,B0009W5J3M,"I am happy to add this season of Macgyver to my dvd library.  Mcgyver is not overly violent, very little profanity and minumum sexuality.  If my elderly mom or my young grandchildren wanted to watch Macgyver I would not feel embarrased to play it for them.",1220745600,,256,4.543478260869565
2326559,4,B0009W5J3M,This is one of my all time favorite TV Shows.  The third season is like the rest of the seasons in all respects.  Plenty of Jammed packed action.  I cannot believe this show was cancelled.  I wish it was still on the air.,1213833600,,221,4.069767441860465
2326560,3,B0009W5J3M,"Found this season on sale at the local mega mart and thought it would be a great watch-together for me and my eleven year old boy.  Excellent story lines with only a few predictable plots.  Fast enough pace to keep me and my young-un interested.  Thin storage cases that hold two DVD's each - nice.  I was afraid these were going to be double-sided DVD's - always tough to determine which episodes you're loading, but not to worry.  Only real complaint is the video transfer.  Looks like the source material was VHS tape rather than film stock.  Acceptable on a portable DVD player, but annoying when seen on a big screen TV.  Would have been 5 stars otherwise.",1142726400,12,661,4.5423728813559325
2326561,1,B0009W5J3M,"The first two seasons on DVD had great picture quality and looked crisp and clean.

Unfortunately this third season of MacGyver on DVD has abysmal picture quality. It looks as bad as a worn-out VHS tape, has color smears and horizontal streaks as if copied straight from somebody's tape collection.

That's a shame because season 3 was the best yet :(

Shame on you Universal!",1142294400,8,376,4.753846153846154

2326564,5,B0009W5J3M,Why dont' they have shows like this on tv now?  My five sons adore this show.  I can't wait for season four to come!  Any ideas as to when it's coming out?,1130284800,4,155,3.78125
2326565,5,B0009W5J3M,"I was a big fan of this show when it was originally broadcast. I think the writing is imaginative, clever, and oft times humorous.

  It is amazinging what Mac can do with duct tape and a Swiss Army Knife. I know the Swiss make army knives, but do they have an army?

  All three seasons so far have been well worth the money spent.",1129420800,2,332,4.109375
2326566,5,B0009W5J3M,"THE THIRD SEASON OF MACGYVER HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. THE LOVE STORY AT THE BEGINNING, THE RETURN OF MURDOCH, BIGFOOT, AND EVEN HOCKEY! A VERY GOOD SEASON FOR THE SHOW, IT LEADS AWAY FROM THE INDIANA JONES TYPE STORIES OF PREVIOUS SEASONS. WE GET TO SEE MAC IN HUMANITARIAN CAUSES CLOSE TO HOME, AND NOT JUST GLOBETROTTING. JACK DALTON IS A KEY PLAYER IN THIS SEASON, AND ALMOST ""STEALS"" THE SCREEN WHEN HES ON. I ALWAYS ENJOY MURDOCH, HE IS SIMPLY THE BEST, AND HE NEVER ACTUALLY DIES WHICH IS FANTASTIC. AS MUCH AS HE CAN'T KILL MACGYVER, MAC CANNOT SEEM TO GET RID OF HIM EITHER. HE IS THE ANTITHESIS OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN MAC. WHEN MURDOCH IS BAD, HE'S IN BEST FORM.

I ALSO WANTED TO CORRECT A POST BY gargantsurprise. MURDOCH ACTUALLY MAKES TWO APPEARANCES IN SEASON 5. HE IS IN ""HALLOWEEN KNIGHTS"" AND ""SERENITY"". HE IS NOT LIMITED TO JUST ONE APPEARANCE A SEASON FOR SEASON 5.",1129248000,,888,4.447852760736196
2326567,4,B0009W5J3M,"After buying seasons one and two, of which the episodes were all excellent, I bought season three. This is still a great season, but not all the episodes are as absorbing as the previous two seasons. However there are some great stories in this lot. Look out for ""The Widowmaker"" A great episode with the Assissin 'Murdock' who appears for one episode in each season (apart from season 5 where he shows up for two episodes).

Overall this is a great show. Looking forward to buying seasons 4, 5, 6, and the final 7th season.

I would rate season 3 as 8/10",1127260800,3,555,4.431372549019608

Paramount, I was looking forward to having the complete collection of MacGyver, but I will not buy any more seasons if you do not release the show in good picture quality. It is the worse quality I have ever seen on DVD.",1126569600,6,356,4.313432835820896

If you havn't bought a MacGyver box set yet and are looking for one to get, I would recommend this one over the other two, even though they are all good. This is the season that makes MacGyver MACGYVER. I should know; I've been a MacGyver fan since 1986, when I was six years old, and have been hooked ever since.",1125964800,3,419,4.0602409638554215

He does a great job of keeping it entertaining and still makes it feel like he is just a normal human being like any of us. This season truely brings out the true MacGyver and MacGyverisms.
