Needless to say I saw many of these types of films as a child. (I grew up in the 50s.) I never saw this one and had it on my watchlist. Began to view it last night, hoping for some entertainment for a Friday evening. What a surprise. Horrible picture quality!!! Like so many other reviewers I gave up watching shortly after the opening credits. The VHS tape is much better as reported by a reviewer at Netflix.

216705,2,6300183475,"""Sword of Lancelot"" is an intermittently interesting retelling of the Arthurian legend starring (and directed by) Cornel Wilde as Lancelot, and his second wife Jean Wallace as Guinevere. It's a love story full of treachery, betrayal, action, and stilted dialogue delivered with ponderous accents (Wilde gets top billing here, as he has an absolutely ludicrous French accent.) Lancelot wins Guinevere in a duel to marry King Arthur, but the smoldering love between Lancelot and Guinevere and Arthur has grave repercussions for both the couple and the kingdom even after she marries Arthur.

There are many moments of hilarity in the film, starting at the very outset with soap being confused for a great plague (don't ask.)  ""Sword of Lancelot""  does distinguish itself with some very well done battle scenes with numerous extras (watch for the battle with Vikings!) and modestly realistic special effects (very good for the early 1960's) interspersed with the love story, which tends to drag. I am not a huge fan of Arthurian epics, and this one is in the middle of the pack: I have certainly seen better and worse of the genre, but what largely does this release in is the terrible quality of the print. The transfer is awful with horrendous color (note the aqua cast throughout) and numerous scratches and flaws apparent. The sound is grossly uneven and is, if anything, even worse than the picture. These flaws are very pronounced and make watching the film an absolute chore at some points. Though the film itself is an average retelling or a well-known tale, the technical foibles of this release led me to my ultimate two star rating.",1394928000,,1640,4.956363636363636
216716,3,6300183475,"Enjoyable for what it is, so if you like stories of medieval knights and as long as you don't expect too much it's a fun time.

Sound quality is a bit iffy on here I places but there really are not very many films in this genre to choose from.

There are several old films that should be on prime that are not: ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Knights of the Round Table"", & ""Ivanhoe"" to name a few.

Interesting to see the British Knights fighting Vikings since historically the Normans who conquered Britain had Viking heritage.

216723,4,6300183475,"Sword of Lancelot, 1963 film

Knights in chain link armor ride towards Camelot. King Arthur meets his knights, Lancelot is late but has an excuse: he was using `sapo'. [It removes grease, lice, and fleas.] The King plans a dynastic marriage to Guinevere, the daughter of a neighboring king. A messenger arrives with a challenge to trial by combat [legal until 1818 in England]. King Arthur names Lancelot as his champion in this duel. Knights wear armor, horses have padded blankets. Lancelot's sword stroke ends the argument. Arthur is now king of all Britain! But a new wife may disinherit the king's son. There is a danger in the woods for the escort party, but it is cut back. The party arrives safely at Camelot. Arthur plans to repress these brigands [often runaway serfs]. Guinevere meets Arthur and they are married. There is a feast afterwards. People talk about life. The Queen swoons and is carried to her room. ""What might have been?""

The King will ride to the hounds. [Elkhounds?] This sport is practice for war. Lancelot reads ""The Odes of Horace"" while close to Guinevere. Word comes of an invasion of barbarians from the sea. Lancelot suggests a strategy to attack them while Arthur raises a bigger army. The invaders take no male prisoners. Arthur's archers hit the guards, trees are cut down to block the exit. Flaming arrows start fires, the invaders flee to the forest. The invaders are destroyed. The Queen rejoices in the survival of Lancelot. Lancelot is warned against his enemies and advised to leave for Brittany. Guinevere speaks her mind. They have enemies at court. At night Lancelot waits for Guinevere. ""Only a little longer."" Lancelot is discovered by armed men, defends himself, and escapes. The Queen is bound to a stake in preparation for her punishment.

Popular opinion is divided. Some of the soldiers join with Lancelot. Will there be a war? Merlin does not offer advice on this question. ""What can he do?"" [Note the expressions on the faces of the people! Some enjoy this spectacle.] A group of knights ride up to free Guinevere. Lancelot refuses combat, his castle is besieged. But he offers a deal to Arthur. Merlin brings a response. Lancelot is banished to France, Guinevere will be sent to a convent. News from England tells of Arthur's death by Mordred. There is now war in the land. Mordred has a plan to trap the enemy. Lancelot hopes this battle will end the war. [There is always a foreign threat.] The lines of battle clash. Archers loose their arrows. Knights fight on horseback. Lancelot pursues Mordred and they fight with swords.

Lancelot visits Guinevere and learns what has happened. There is a final disappointment. Guinevere has made her choice. Lancelot must leave forever. What does this all mean? Farewell. [Those who read these old stories can best comment on this adaption.] The Red Dragon on Arthur's coat is still a symbol for the Britons of Wales today. The invasion by Angles and Saxons pushed the Britons toward the southwest of Britain and renamed the country England. The Norman French invasion of 1066 put new rulers in charge of the country with new laws. This movie tells little about the legends and history of Camelot. The Roman invasion circa 100 BC left its mark even after the Romans left in the fifth century AD. Horace's advice to be content with your status is the correct message here. Even the king and queen, or a mighty warrior, should have learned this lesson.",1336003200,,3449,4.820945945945946

216725,1,6300183475,"I had fond memories of this movie from childhood, and should have left it there! Obviously no attempt whatsoever was made to restore this film. Indeed, it opens with a foreground frame that looks like a 60's era TV set, and the quality of the film is so poor that you can easily imagine it was copied direct from TV! The frame goes away, but alas, the poor quality does not.
On the plus side, the acting is good and some of the battle scenes were probably quite graphic for the day. Even so, I can also imagine that Monty Python probably drew a lot of inspiration from some of the early scenes which simply come across as quite laughable. The director, Cornell Wilde (one of my favorite old-time actors actually), apparently thought the movie required a lot of trumpet blowing and that quickly becomes ludicrous.
The Menu system, if you want to call it that, only takes you back-and-forth between the movie and the FBI warning. There are no languages, no sub-titles, and no ability to select individual scenes. Thank goodness fast-forward still works, as it is the only way to watch this thing. In terms of DVD quality, shame on whoever put this junk together!
For the money, Robert Taylor's ""Ivanhoe"" from 1952 is a much better purchase!",1266624000,2,1238,4.631818181818182
216736,3,6300183475,"This is not a bad telling of the classic ""Camelot"" tale.  The main problem with this film in my view is that in this version Guenevere is immediately smitten with Lancelot, so there is no subtlety at all as regards the betrayal of King Arthur by his favorite knight and by his bride.  King Arthur himself in this film is shown as almost impossibly naive not to see what is coming.

There are other redeeming features of this film.  The camaraderie of the Knights of the Round Table is charming, and the fight scenes (especially the initial joust) are fun to watch.  Despite the above criticisms, this film moves along briskly and holds the viewer's interest.  I don't buy the ending (no spoilers here) but the viewer may judge for him or her self.

My DVD is not a particularly good copy.  The sound is somewhat uneven, and the transfer of the video is not as good as I had hoped.",1255219200,10,880,4.422360248447205

216741,1,6300183475,"I bought this movie for $1.00 in a big discount bin.  I paid too much.

First of all, Cornell Wilde and Jean Wallace (his real life wife) are at least 20 years too old to be playing these parts.  Get yourself a good bottle before you begin the movie, you will need it.

Although Cornell Wilde could act at times, with the right direction, this is not one of those cases, since he directed (and produced) the film.  It was a vehicle for his wife, but she just could not act.  In this version, she has to carry the film, and although given a lot of screen time, she just had no presence and no acting ability.  Add to that a very bad 1960's blonde dye job, teased hair and a swimming scene that had even more fantasy to it than the Legend itself, and you have an absurd camp recreation of the Arthurian Legend.

However, if you can stand the phony French accent of Cornell Wilde, which already takes away from the bad script, there are some very good battle scenes that are well done.  The supporting cast (Brian Aherne as Arthur), Archie Duncan are very good.  It's too bad that Mr. Wilde insisted on playing the lead role and the same goes for Ms. Wallace.  The air brush job of Cornell Wilde and Jean Wallace on the cover should have been done on every frame of film for this to be believeable.  Cornell Wilde can fence, and it shows, but it is too little, too late and they are too old.",1216771200,,1388,4.23574144486692
216742,3,6300183475,"This is one of those classic ""Hollywood"" versions of the Arthurian legend. It is filled with pageantry, taut action, and of course the forbidden romance of Lancelot and Guinevere. Cornel Wilde is more than convincing in the lead role. And his real life wife, Jean Wallace, is a striking as Wilde's love interest. When watching this version, keep in mind of the period in which it was made and for the audience for whom it was intended. To put it simply, just enjoy. With all that said, I cannot recommend this DVD. The quality of the transfer is horrific! Save your money and wait for a remastered edition to be released.",1212883200,,621,4.603603603603603
216743,2,6300183475,"As other reviews note, this film focuses on the love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere and how their love, aided by Mordred's desires to be king, destroys Camelot.

216744,3,6300183475,"This version of King Arthur et al concentrates more on Lancelot and Gueneviere rather than developing the other central characters of the Camelot gang. What makes this movie good is that it has some very good battle scenes, first against a Viking horde and then the final battle sequence against Mordred and his buddies. The love story aspect is really not too bad. There is one major problem with the DVD...it's an awful transfer. The colors are faded and it appears that only an old film copy could be found to use in the transfer. It's the worst dvd transfer I've seen so far...even worse than El Cid. The problem appears that there are companies using China and other 'outsourced' countries to make these copies...and they suck.",1125187200,11,732,4.771653543307087
216745,4,6300183475,"Cornel wilde was sort of the bridge wetween Errol Flynn and Kevin Costner. He started out in swashbuckling adventures, then tried his hand directing epic movies, attempting to re-interpret each genre he tackles. Here he tackles the Arthurian romance/medieval epic with a focus on the suffering of passionate love against loyalty and duty.
One can say that a parallel of passions is played out here. Both Guenevere and Mordred want something they can't have, and Lancelot's duty to King Arthur is to deny them both. These two desires wind up working for each other, though in Mordred's case it's deliberate, Gwen's passion makes her not realize the danger she is putting the kingdom in.
Hollywood movies had gotten a little less stiff in how they portrayed romance and love scenes by this time, and Wilde takes advantage of it, giving the romantic leads a little bit more steam than they had in ""Knights of the Round Table."" It doesn't make the romance much more convincing, however. The trouble with many Arthurian movies is the unconvincing set up for the love between Lancelot and Guenevere (""Camelot"" is a significant exception to this). The slightly stilted writing and silly French accent that Wilde puts on doesn't help.
There is plenty of sword-swinging action scenes. There's a joust, two battles, a fight through the castle, and a rescue. There is some innovation in the fight scenes; heads and body parts are cleaved, rather than sanitary thrusts to the armpit. Unfortunately, there is a degree of stiffness to the fighting and battles (unlike the love scenes) that detract from the drama. In the joust Lancelot sits on his horse, standing still, and recieves a lance with nary a quiver. Perhaps the pan-and-scan (""full-frame"") presentation is at fault in some bits.  In several battle scenes the figure in the center is the guy standing around like he doesn't know what to do. It also seems that some of the weapons, axes and maces, are too big for the one-handed use they are given.
The production design follows 11th-12th century styles of costume, armor, and architecture (mostly). This would match the period in which was written Geoffrey of Monmouth's ""History of the Kings of Britain,"" the foundation of much of the Arthurian legend (ironically, Lancelot is not in that version). Unfortunately there is some stiffness here also. Certain pieces of costume and armor look clumsy and awkward, and of course the chain mail is all Hollywood fake stuff.
This film does have more appeal to fans of the genre than the average movie viewer. It is interesting as a transitional piece between ""Knights of the Round Table"" and ""First Knight"" (""Excalibur"" is in a different league).
A bit of trivia: In one scene, Gwen talks about a bowman named Diccon. Diccon bowman was a charater in Henry Pyle's ""Men of Iron,"" made into the movie called ""Black Shield of Fallworth.""",970704000,19,2873,4.93595041322314
