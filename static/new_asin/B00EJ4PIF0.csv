8605940,5,B00EJ4PIF0,"I watched these when they were on TV and have started re-watching the season sets, Malcolm in the Middle is one of those shows that even though you know what's coming, it's still hilarious to see it play out again on the screen again and again and again.  The first thing that is apparent when season three kicks off with the Houseboat episode where the family is in a sporting goods store and Hal insists on wearing speedos he keeps popping out of is that Malcolm has grown up physically a fair bit from season two.  As has Reece to a less noticeable extent.

Season three sees Francis get emancipated, escape Military school and follow his ex roommate to Alaska.  Of course the journey there isn't smooth at all, especially a detour stop off visiting his family.  The small town holding cell soap opera lives of the officers episode is one of the highlights.  Once he reaches Alaska it isn't the money making opportunity and lifestyle he'd envisaged either.

Other notable episodes when you think back about how great this was and you probably remember from season three are Reece getting his learners and unhappy he's not getting a go in drivers ed forces his way into the driver's seat, and when rear-ended panics and goes on a slow speed pursuit with a trail of police cars in his wake.

The Company Picnic where Hal wants to make a good impression on his new boss, having stuffed up every similar meeting in the past, while a three legged scavenger hunt has Malcolm paired up with a girl he likes and Reese with a large dim-witted boy.  Dewey is trying to sneak candy while Lois tries to avoid an annoying woman.

Season three also introduces the hamster in the orange ball reoccurring gag after Dewey is assigned to look after the school pet.  Reese gets a job at a fast food restaurant where Richie accuses him of stealing $200.

The Krelboynes get a new teacher who used to be one of them but lost everything in a dotcom failed business and takes it out on the students. Dewey finally has the birthday party his family never gave him. Dewey also takes in a stray dog which he uses for his vengeance against his brothers.  Lois has to serve jury duty and the season ends with Craig getting a helper monkey which he of course berates and abuses then he believes it is trying to kill him.",1437350400,,2294,4.498795180722891
