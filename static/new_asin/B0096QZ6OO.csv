8536934,2,B0096QZ6OO,"The first movie on this disc is Sins of the Father.  An enormously cheesy 1980's made for TV movie.  Not even Coburn can rescue the predictable and corny storyline which had us fast forwarding to get us through the pain.  The second movie on this disc is titled A Reason To Live A Reason To Die which is the movie titled Massacre At Fort Holman on most other discs featuring Coburn and Bud Spencer.  The quality of this movie on this disc is outstanding compared to another one we have and we were able to re-watch this movie in its entirety from start to finish.  All in all not a bad ""western"" and certainly better than the first movie on this disc.",1388620800,2,651,4.30327868852459
8536935,5,B0096QZ6OO,"An excellent James Coburn double-feature. Sins Of the Father (1985) a very good TV movie featuring Glynnis O'Connor, Ted Wass, Joan Prather and Marion Ross. Nice quality transfer, good music, talented cast.
A Reason To Live, A Reason To Die (1972) MGM wide screen print, probably the best version I have seen of this film. Crisp and clear with great audio and a top cast - James Coburn of course, Telly Savalas and Bud Spencer. TGG DIRECT have done a superb job releasing these films on a single disc at a very affordable price.
Highly Recommended.",1374624000,5,548,4.71875
