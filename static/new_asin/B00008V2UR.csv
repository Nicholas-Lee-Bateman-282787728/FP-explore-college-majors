7986940,4,B00008V2UR,Better transfer than the Central Park drifter dvd version thats why I gave it 4 instead of 3 like I did with the other copy. I have both and its not the best no bad its actually more appreciated now as a B-movie late night erotic vampire tale with good nudity and makeup for super low budget,1520294400,,291,4.12280701754386
7986941,4,B00008V2UR,this is a very underated movie.my only disapointment is that is not uncut.neither is the uk version.both have been cut in diffrent places.i have yet to see a full uncut version of this film as it is one of my favourites.a 1980s classic that deserves more recognition than it has.,1444176000,,279,4.6

7986943,4,B00008V2UR,"Graveyard Shift is a wonderful, interesting, vampire movie.  A vampire is a taxi driver who works the night shift.  As he picks up passengers he picks his victims from those who are at the end of their rope.  People, in this case sexy women, who wish to kill themselves.  He turns them into vampires.  They become part of a vampire network which keeps him supplied with blood and gives the women a reason to live.  In other words he turns almost suicides into vampires which is a nice link to folklore vampires.  The problem is he falls in love and screws up what was a pretty nice setup and life style.  The only problem I have is with the DVD.  I have seen the movie before on tape and on the DVD many scenes were either too dark or just too unfocused to see.  It looks like they got as bad copy, which is sad because otherwise it is a good film.  Also, sorry to say, there are no extras outside of some trailers.",1210723200,2,915,4.2011494252873565
