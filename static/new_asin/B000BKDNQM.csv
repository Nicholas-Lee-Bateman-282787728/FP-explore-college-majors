2421658,1,B000BKDNQM,"Not ONE new engine on this DVD, despite what the 'Thomas and Friends Yearbook' says.  There is no episode with Molly, Neville,or Dennis on this whole DVD.  There is one, however, with Peter Sam, who cannot be purchased anymore because he is retired. My son is very disappointed.",1148428800,14,278,4.770833333333333

2421680,3,B000BKDNQM,Thomas the train DVD gives hours of pleasure to 20 month old grandson... However he is not a fan of the hollowen section.,1341705600,,121,4.304347826086956
2421681,5,B000BKDNQM,"Odered this for my grandson,who is 2yrs. I already have one of the Thomas the Train DVD's & he loves that one.  Thought he should have one for his house.  Shippping early!",1318982400,,171,4.3125
2421682,4,B000BKDNQM,"Our 18-month old daughter loves Thomas and is familiar with the show, so we bought this video (along with some other videos and a portable DVD player!) to keep her entertained on a long road trip.  The video contains several adventures, and although she had already seen them on PBS, she was enraptured.  She still loves watching Thomas, the ones on this dvd as well as the ones on TV.  A little silver special edition vehicle is included with the video; in our case, it was Percy, and our daughter carried it around for some time after the trip (maybe because it looks different from the others?).  We do wish the DVD was a little longer, but overall, if you are looking for some cute Thomas adventures for your little one, this is a good choice.",1262131200,,747,4.470588235294118

2421684,4,B000BKDNQM,"I just bought this for $7.50 @ Walmart. It is a good show. And about Sir Topham Hat's mother being mad- she's not. Thomas thinks she ""looks stearn"". He must use his self confidence to come up with a birthday she would like without letting his worries about her being stearn fear him.",1201219200,,283,4.3584905660377355
2421685,1,B000BKDNQM,"It seems Sir Toppem hat is ticked in all the episodes.  he booms, his mother is stern looking on her birthday (who is stern on their birthday &*$# ?)

2421686,5,B000BKDNQM,"We like Thomas. Ideal for everybody; nice stories, nice songs and games.

This DVD has the feature to be in Spanish also. For years we wait some spanish releases to be available. We have two at the moment (as far as I know). Is a nice DVD, I bought it directly from Amazon, and is great. If you have some kids to send a gift to SouthAmerica, send this one.",1168214400,3,356,4.085714285714285

2421688,1,B000BKDNQM,"We are very unhappy with this particular video. When you purchase Molly, Dennis or Neville, there is a description that they make ""their debut"" in this video. The ONLY place Molly appears is in one of the songs and it is only for a split second. My 3 1/2 yr old is very sad and said, ""this is very strange, where is Molly?"" He recieved her for Christmas and has been waiting for this video to come out. He finally earned enough reward points only to be dissapointed! How awful!",1149120000,10,477,4.311111111111111
