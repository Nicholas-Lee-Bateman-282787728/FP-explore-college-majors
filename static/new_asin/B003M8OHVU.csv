Four Lions is a daring little comedy with balls of iron. Using terrorism as a source of comedy maybe one of the hardest methods to make people ponder about this important issue. Especially the way that Director Chris Morris pursues the subject, one often fears that the topic may be used as the butt of jokes, and form a debased comedy. I have no clue how Morris does it, but he never crosses the moral/ethical line of GLORIZING the terror or demeaning the victims.

This comedy is based on a group of extremist Muslims who decide to demonstrate in the face of all this consumerism and corruption of the West, the beauty of their religion by commiting horrible deeds-that in their eyes are nothing but noble. Take note that they are from Sheffield, England. Four of the men are identifiably Muslim, but one stands out like a nerd on the football team. He is a white convert to Islam, and the most radical, impatient, and extreme of the pack-trying to convince them to attack a Mosque. Two members, Omar and Waj, get sent to a terrorist training camp with disastrous result-keep watching after the credits to understand the extent of their tragic contribution. After returning, all five, which includes the new recruit Hassan, decide to find a target to express their rage.

These are not organized or trained newbie terrorists. They act independently on their dogma, and hilarity ensues. They are also quite well rounded, unlike the terrorist picture many of us may imagine: isolated people lacking in friends, and lovable family. Omar, for example, has a son, wife, and quite a large group of friends-many which are British. They have no detailed philosophy besides the idea that this consumer Western society is corrupt, and needs to be punished. There is almost no discussion of Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, or any terrorist organization. However, They strive to be Jihadists, and ascend to Heaven. It's that simple in their eyes. No discussion of their victims ever take place, and for good reason. These characters are simplistic in their desires, so even a superficial thought of their victims innocence may thwart their plans.

Chris Morris reportedly has done years of research for this film, predating the 7/7 London Bombings. Unfortunately, we don't see the fruits of his research directly on screen. If his research finds its way in to the final cut of this film, it must be very subliminal because I could not see any evidence that this was deeply researched. Due to his research which included collecting personal account from countless different sources, it seems that Morris at parts is unable to shed light on the emotional aspects. Truths that are self-evident to him are not necessarily evident to us, and certain aspects require more emotional investment.

Many examples of such emotionally ambivalent scenes are spread throughout the film, however they are most evident during the scenes involving Omar's family. Of Course, Omar's son does not know about his father's true intents, but he is teaching his son the moral reason for his task through Disney's Lion King. After their overseas debacle, he explains to him that Simba must lie for now until he can accomplish his true goal. These intimate scenes are done well, as we begin to realize that these men are not hopeless young teens without futures. One of the most out of place scenes occurs after Omar deserts his fellow brothers, disappointed and depressed about their plans. His wife's word about his plans, and eventual demise, are so cold heartedly encouraging that we suddenly recall this is a piece of fiction. She seems to be actually encouraging and advocating his plan, clearly aware that its execution will leave her without a husband, and her son a father. Before this scene we saw these two adults use a water gun to  force a friend out of their house.  They may share the same ideas about the ""depravity"" of Western culture, but they are a loving couple. Morris, in this scene, makes the woman out to be absolutely heartless about her husband, and maybe ready to get rid of him by granting his services to the Lord in Heaven.  This scene is made all the more preposterous by the inclusion of their son in this conversation. Another complaint maybe that the wife is simply a foil character with nothing worthwhile to express. As said before, Morris has done much research on this topic, and maybe the families of terrorists are as ""open-minded"" as this, willing to give up their husbands, and parents in the Lord's service. Even if this is the case, Morris needs to stray from his facts, and show more compassion in these scenes, or progress to this line of though gradually, not spontaneously.

Four Lions also suffers from a smug sense of profundity. It often feels that the film believes besides laughs it is giving us an earnest and deeply insightful view about terrorism. Whenever Morris decides to make his work more insightful, the comedy suffers drastically. True, we are talking about people blowing themselves and others up by explosives, yet a truly comedic tone fits this successful premise well. The film's serious moments are so far and in between that they never make the impact that he desires. A prime example is the concluding scene when Omar wants to make Waj, one of the co-conspirators, to give himself up. When this fails, Omar marches in to a pharmacy completing his mission. This serious scene steals from the comedy of the four men running around for twenty minutes in preposterous costumes ranging from Honey Munster to an ostrich. After this, a somber songs begins that is truly not in the spirit of the film. I believe Morris believed he had made a serious statement, like the one at the beginning and conclusion of American Beauty. Four Lions loses it's touch, and becomes somewhat disjointed from its black comedy elements when it choses to take such a drastically different route.

Despite all this criticism, I found Four Lions to more insightful and original than most current comedies distributed in the last few years. Morris of course does not succeed in  all his goals, but miraculously saves himself from much criticism that his Brass Eye series received in the last decade. He looks at the issue at a very specific angle which makes the comedy, despite the subject, extremely funny. His characters are somewhat stupid and carless which are necessary elements for a film on such a bleak subject.  If only the bomber's of 7/7, and hijackers of 9/11, were as independent and clueless as these men are, the victims of their actions would be miniscule in number.",1299283200,19,6655,4.858906525573192
4154397,5,B003M8OHVU,"Director Chris Morris takes a taboo subject (Jihadists, suicide bombings, etc.) and makes it hilarious without really offending anyone (I don't think). This film is seriously well made, well acted, will scripted, well shot and ultimately has a powerful message about human behavior without being preachy or condescending. This is probably one of the top-5 British films of the last decade. This DVD was superb with an excellent documentary on Morris' research into the subject matter, interviews, and other extras. I have verified this edition to be all-region and will play in any USA player.",1296950400,,593,5.252631578947368
4154398,5,B003M8OHVU,"""Four Lions"" is one of the most intelligent, important, illuminating, disturbing, and uncompromising political comedies of recent memory. It takes one of the biggest risks a movie of this day and age can take, and pulls it off: It presents us with a farcical look at modern jihadism. And yet it's not content with merely making us laugh at the very, very serious; it aims to humanize and shed light on a situation many of us are completely unfamiliar with apart from impersonal news reports and media generalizations. Set aside any notion that all Islamic terrorists are squirreled away in caves deep within Pakistan or Afghanistan - many live Westernized lives in densely populated cities, and as is the case with the planning of any large-scale event, there's a lot of doubt, puzzlement, fighting, and mistake making.

The central character is Omar (Riz Ahmed), a disheartened English Muslim at odds with the world over its persecution of Islam and its followers. He longs to go to Pakistan and train as a soldier, which might be possible due to family connections. He has a wife and son, and they both expect he will not only blow himself up very soon, but also do it in such a way that it feels right in his heart. Unfortunately, he has to put up with three fellow jihadists, all of whom are a few coconuts short of a palm tree. Waj (Kayvan Novak) is easily confused and has no real idea what he's doing or why he's doing it. Faisal (Adeel Akhtar) is training crows to be suicide bombers due to the less than optimal health of his father. Barry, a white Islamic convert (Nigel Lindsay), is a raging, paranoid extremist who hates just about everyone, including Omar.

Omar and Waj travel to Pakistan only to return earlier than expected, their terrorist training having gone disastrously wrong. Barry then conceives of a plan to bomb a mosque, which he believes will inspire moderate Muslims to finally get off the fence and become jihadists. Omar is vehemently against the idea; he argues that murdering Muslims as a call to other Muslims makes about as much sense as punching your own face in the middle of a fistfight. Into this infighting enters a new recruit, Hassan (Arsher Ali), who raps and talks big about jihad and Muslim discrimination but is really just an angry kid in need of a big brother. Barry discovered him in the audience of a political debate, where he made a statement by setting off phony explosives loaded with streamers.

Even though the location of the bombing is still being argued, they all agree that a bombing will take place at some point in the not-too-distant future. In due time, they converge at a marathon run, their explosives concealed by rented cartoon costumes - the kinds that poor, unappreciated performers have to wear at birthday parties and sporting events. The heinousness of this plan is masterfully balanced by the sheer absurdity of it; there are times when I honestly didn't know whether to laugh at these men or shudder at the thought of innocent people being killed.

One of the things I enjoyed most was director Chris Morris' ability to focus our attention on nuances hidden within the overall situation. Most movies about terrorists would not only be deadly serious, but would also provide us with a very broad view of the actual terrorist act, in effect neglecting the characters and the emotion. With ""Four Lions,"" the overall situation is secondary to the ups and downs of making it happen. With Omar, for example, we know that he's plotting a terrorist attack, but we're more interested in the fact that he has to do all the work because the other jihadists are incompetent fools who don't make terrorist tapes so much as extended blooper reels. Although most people are not extremists who have masterminded a bombing, working towards something and feeling as if your progress is being slowed is undeniably relatable.

The film's single greatest accomplishment is its balancing act between satire and sincerity. Morris and his writers are essentially acknowledging that within comedy there is a great deal of truth, and that we can recognize that truth even when we're laughing hysterically. This isn't to suggest that drama isn't truthful, although it certainly goes about in a much different way. The film exposes frailties that are all too human, and by making us laugh at them, we own up to our own inherent flaws. Comedies work best not when they beat you over the head with a gag, but when they personify a highly ridiculous situation. ""Four Lions"" is a masterpiece of tone, characterization, performance, theme, and dialogue. It's without a doubt one of the best films I've seen all year.",1291680000,10,4657,4.81625
4154399,3,B003M8OHVU,"This is about the formation of a terrorist cell,with its conflicts,misunderstandings, rivalries, suggestibilities, set in a Northern English town,by the famous TV satirist Chris Morris. He treats a taboo subject as a subject of comedy,without causing offence. This film takes these homegrown jihadis as buffoons,humanly fallible,more like characters in a 5-a-side team,showing their innately ridiculous schemes. We are not shown the cause of their disillusionment,it is a given. It is full of insults and gaffs and an obscene line in Urdu. They attempt to make martyrdom videos and turn them into vanity projects like home videos,full of wooly thinking,insecurity and peer pressure.

Omar(Riz Ahmed) is disillusioned with the treatment of Muslims by the materialist West,with its McDonald's culture. He presents as a competent,intelligent individual. But after a training trip in Pakistan with Waj,he accidently kills Bin Laden by firing his weapon the wrong way. Barry(Nigel Lindsay) an extremist white convert attempts to be leader, recruits Hassan,who pretends to wear a suicide bomb belt at a public debate. Barry's big idea is to bomb a mosque,to get the moderates to rise up. He also thinks they should all eat their SIM cards to avoid tracking and shake their heads from side to side to avoid the `space cameras'.Hassan will choose martyrdom to get off Media Studies. He also foolishly dances with a young woman surrounded by bomb-making equipment. Faisal wants to train crows to fly bombs. Faj sees the mission as ""rubber dingy rapids"" to Paradise. Omar's wife supports him in his desire to blow himself up,supported by his son. Their domestic bliss is chilling,she thinks its'fun'. Omar as leader upbraids everbody with a constant stream of wit. There are laugh-out loud moments.

The religiously orthodox brother is treated like an uncool bore by Omar's family,yet he is more representative of the Muslim majority,and disapproves of Omar's plans. One of his prayer meetings is invaded by a police security raid. He dresses like a believer. Omar's wife mocks him with a water pistol,he doesn't think equality is right. He also,touchingly,plays football in the rain with an umbrella,as his fellow muslims,asking Omar to join in.

We are in a lampoon,as death is just a puff of smoke,no bloody aftermath. Just think of the difference it would make if they successfully carried off a suicide bombing and many people were killed. A whole other film. Here its all just high jinks and pranks The would-be jihadis are a bunch of clueless morons,misguided,hapless,deluded. At the end Omar realizes after the attempt on the London Marathon,he has been foolish. The last part of the film captures the inherent tragedy of it all. The media is the subject of the film. Image-making official,unofficial. The commentators,acquaintances,officials,try to wrest control of the narrative in the closing sequence. The greatest part of the film is how Morris has us engage with his characters emotionally,we empathise with them. They are a confused group looking for a leader who can explain what they are doing,give them motivation. We get an extended take, which makes the subject,for all its pratfalls believable,not just a series of sketches As much as I liked this feature fim debut, I felt it was a made-for-tv film. But no less an acheivement for that.",1291075200,3,3348,5.230912476722533

4154440,5,B003M8OHVU,"I felt compelled to review this brilliant film because I'm concerned that some of the average and below average ratings might convince someone to not watch this movie.  It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea--it's straight up satire and it's dark.  It's also laugh-out-loud funny in my opinion, while also a very sad cautionary tale.  I hate to say that I doubt I would recommend this movie to many people I know, especially after the Boston Marathon attack and the formation of ISIS, because I think that many people have a knee-jerk reaction to Muslims anyway, especially Muslim radicals--never mind why they might be radicals or even to consider if, as the characters in this film, whether they actually are radicals, because the four lions aren't really radicals--they are just playing the Eastern equivalent of cowboy and have absolutely no real political or religious call--it's all straight-up misplaced machismo. The movie also presents an orthodox Muslim character who is very religiously strict but keeps expressing to his brother--one of the four lions--that he hopes he isn't involving himself in something that goes against the peaceful nature of their religion.  So, this was an eye-opener to me and I would hope it would teach a lot of people that there are these sort of people in all nations and religions; some are orthodox and strict while also being peace-loving and logical, some who are merely giving it mouth service but either want to hurt other people or play the hero--or both and haven't enough self-awareness or intelligence to question their own motives.  It's going to offend people who cannot separate satire from plain comedy, nor cautionary tales from gratuitous exploitation.  If you like the Ricky Gervais Netflix show ""Derek"" you might like this--that show has the same impact: it really is rude, hilarious, sweet, and undefinable--and it's one of the best shows in my opinion.",1476489600,,1917,5.050632911392405

4155082,4,B003M8OHVU,"Due to an unexpected change in employment and the fiscal challenges that comes from that change, I no longer have the freedom to screen films with any regularity. That means that selection becomes all the more important - I can't burn what free time I have to waste on pointless regurgitations and hype-driven drivel.

Relying on other sources to funnel the best reviewed to cull the chaff from the wheat, that's how I came upon this bizarre, but insanely funny, indie film. I'm not familiar with Chris Morris, but will say that if this is representative of his work - he's found a new fan.

Tells the story of a wannabe terrorist cell in England. Five men who have dedicated their lives to jihad.

Disturbing.

Now, imagine that terrorist cell and combining that horrible twisted energy with: The Three Stooges.

Sound crazy? It did, and does. But shockingly, this approach worked to perfection in 'Four Lions'.

Don't get me wrong, there's genuine malevolence being portrayed here as well. Particularly as Director Morris peers into the family life of Omar, the terrorist team leader. Their casual and frightfully cheerful family discussions surrounding daddy and husband ""blowing himself up at the right target"" is extremely disturbing to say the least. That both wife and son are eagerly anticipating his martyrdom is absolutely unnerving and incredibly frightful.

But thankfully the film is balanced out to reveal this through a sharp satirical and humorous lens.

Favorite quotes, and believe me this film is filled to the brim with guffaw material.

""Are they going to make me bleep a dog out there brotha Omar?""

""...yeah like you...buying more silver nitrate from Amazon.""*

""The Bean Thing.""

""Okay, we gotta get down to Gay Business now.""

""No, it's a cultural thing. We bazooka'ed an ostrich at a wedding I was at.""

Overall, I'm torn between four and five stars. A full unequivocal fifth isn't in the cards from my perspective given that the subject is so alarmingly charming - in many respects disconnecting us from the genuine hate and fear that drives the pursuit of global terrorism. There was a wariness I couldn't shake while watching this film, a sense that while we mock and prod, the hardcore extremists will refuel and rededicate.

Timing is the critical issue.

Example: When Mel Brooks did ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Producers/dp/B000BMY2LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Producers</a>"" in 1968 - the Nazis had been defeated for more than two decades. Funny stuff. On the other hand, when Charlie Chaplain filmed ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Dictator/dp/B004DHNQGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Dictator</a>"" in 1940, he was on the cutting edge of provocation since December 7, 1941 was still a year away. And notably, Chaplin was targeted for assassination by the goose-stepping jackboots. Not funny stuff.

So timing plays a part in my reluctance to give this dark comedy a fifth star.

A very strong four.

Personal Notes:

- I'm fully aware that this film preceded the terrifying events at the Boston Marathon by three years. Nor am I making light of the handful of innocents who were murdered in the film. But let's be honest and point out that the filmmakers also rightfully lambasted the official face of authority and the politics of public relations spin, as two police sharpshooters kill an innocent person and then began arguing the differences between Brown Bears versus Star Wars Wookies. And the police SWAT team accidentally killing the innocent kebab shop owner, then positing a ridiculous theory during their after action review. Death by incompetence was one of the underlying themes of this farcical comedy.

- *I had to look this up. Silver nitrate is a medicine that was primarily used as eye drops for newborn babies. It only sounds dangerous.  X-D",1379808000,3,3903,5.291734197730956

Their leader is a Pakistani security guard with a soulful, worried face, given to cursing fluidly and colorfully in Urdu; his followers include a non-Asian convert to Islam convinced that the best target for suicide bombing is the local mosque. The scene in which this man's tortuous reasoning for this surprising choice is debated is as brilliantly funny as the ""what have the Romans ever done for us?"" episode in Monty Pythons Life of Brian, and just as pointed. Fanaticism and its rituals are mocked here with a boldness and freedom from political correctness that I'm afraid few American directors, certainly no American studio executives, could ever match. The lions, who are different from one another and oddly likable--one, the most slow witted, has a touching love of amusement park rides--in the end show themselves to be, like so many  enlistees in violent jihad, pathetic, deluded, and lethal losers.

4155099,5,B003M8OHVU,"This is British farce at its very best: using comedy to make a serious point. The plot is simple: a group of Pakistani simpletons living in the British Midlands get caught up in jihadi fever and seek to prove their worth by blowing up something. What? Well, that's the problem. How about a chemist's shop (equivalent to a US drug store)? What about a mosque? Half the group aren't even all that keen on self-immolation but they are pushed forward (albeit in different directions) by the two wannabe leaders.

The plot charges forward with all the energy and misguided enthusiasm of a four-year-old on a sugar high. Everyone is an idiot, from the jihadis themselves (two of whom travel to Pakistan to receive training in a terror camp but end up accidentally killing... well, watch the movie and see for yourself) to the British police who raid the wrong people and consistently shoot the wrong guys (sadly, too much like real life...). And there's the usual politician trying to apply spin after a police AT team burst into a restaurant and shoot dead the hostage, leaving the mentally sub-par jihadi untouched so that he is able subsequently to blow them all up: ""Let me make it absolutely clear: the police shot the right guy. But then the wrong guy exploded.""

The pleasure in this movie comes from a combination of great dialog and dead-serious acting which provides counterpoint to the farcical situation of the would-be jihadis. These are life's losers and the real impetus to self-destruction comes from each character's residual awareness of this sad fact. So the surprise in the movie is the fact that it's not played for laughs like a US movie would be; it's actually a very funny movie played straight. Right up until the moment one of the group accidentally detonates himself when carrying home-made explosives the whole thing seems likely to play out without anyone being hurt; and then... real death strides into the scene and takes up position center-stage. The deaths that follow are like the rest of the movie: played straight, not elaborated. There's no Hollywood pyrotechnics here, no slowed-down explosions and fireballs. Just a loud bang and a cloud of dust. And someone who has just been blown to shreds. Even though we've been laughing at these inept would-be terrorists the moment of death is poignant and affecting precisely because it's just as real as the rest of the incidents. No Hollywood death is ever emotionally engaging because effects are always placed before people; here it's the opposite. The denouement - the last ten minutes of the movie - is both funny and terribly sad.

This isn't a political movie. It doesn't explore themes of alienation (why do so many Pakistani boys feel hopeless and isolated in British society?) nor sexual frustration (data shows most male suicide bombers are virgins who truly believe their god will reward them with 77 virgins when they get to their heaven) nor fanatical religious belief (why is Omar's wife so ready to see her husband - the father of their child - blow himself to pieces when seemingly she's a well-adjusted Moslem woman with a decent job?).

4155115,5,B003M8OHVU,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***

Five twenty-something lads from Sheffield wanting to be Afghan terrorists on British soil is not exactly an easy sell for a film - even for the most liberal minded of viewers. This is the kind of material that walks a thin line between black humour and the need to tell the truth - no matter how offensive or uncomfortable it may be. But ""Four Lions"" 'so' works. Written and Directed by CHRIS MORRIS - his debut is an edgy risk-taking movie - and absolutely chockers full of laugh-out loud moments - and for all the right reasons...

It goes like this - the constantly babbling, but worldly nave Waj is easily influenced by the disillusioned but far more radical Omar (Kayvan Novak and Riz Ahmed). Both 'brothers' want to do 'God's will' - which they believe is to become Mujahideen soldiers and start their own Islamic Jihad somewhere in affluent materialistic England. They essentially want to blow something up. Helping them away from Western materialism and Chicken McNuggets is the self-appointed cleric Barry (a fantastically funny turn by a scene-stealing Nigel Lindsay). Barry rabbits on about 'surveillance protocols', eats SIM cards and once planted a 'twin towers' cake in a local mosque to incite the faithful. Rolling under garage doors like an SAS commando and sidling up to people's porches likes he's Jason Bourne - Barry is convinced that a passing mother and child is a cop and the American Feds are watching him on satellites in space. Barry is the worst and most boorish of the five. A converted white man and bearded radical, he is full of nice things to say about open-mindedness like ""...we've got women talking back bruv! We've got people playing stringed instruments!"" Barry orders silver nitrate from Amazon and wants to ""Boom! Fast track to final days! Proper war!""

Thrown into this pool of misguided idiots is the slow and permanently bewildered Faisal  (Adeel Akhtar) - a hapless bomb-maker who stashes thousands of bottles of hair peroxide in his lock-up. Fassal wants to attach detonator devices to crows and fly them into Government buildings (hence the poster). Last but not least is Hassan (Arsher Ali) - an on-the-fence believer who wants to go 'proper' Afghan. Hassan talks the lingo about 'a new purpose in life' but Omar suspects that maybe he doesn't have the balls to actually do the dirty deed. None of them do. It's all a big game to the other four and Omar will need to make it 'real' this time. Plots are hatched in the bedsit above the men's shop Bolby Tailoring, rocket launchers go off backwards and Omar's microwave oven gets sacrificed in the name of the 'cause'. And on the mayhem goes to the London Marathon of 2010 where they're dressed as chickens with something more than lean cuisine beneath their feathers. But of course it stops being funny very, very fast when the consequences and repercussions of what they're doing becomes all too real...and they get more than hurt...

How do you deal with extremism - humour is one weapon - Chaplin knew this. But part of this script's genius is to go deeper into the monster's psyche - to show us how 'religion' seriously screws with a person's moral compass - especially if that belief system has an 'our way is the only way' core mentality. There is also the lure of power - the power of a gun - how it gets you noticed - even respected. And of course that's amplified if you're prepared to have a bomb strapped to you and seek martyrdom.

The danger in all this is that despite the film's best intentions Muslims are tarred with a terrorist brush - but the writing is smart enough to address this - and even deal with racism among their own ranks by slagging both off with real skill. Subtle touches include Omar receiving an e-mail at work (he's a security guard) telling that his trip to the Pakistan is in 2 days time (spy talk for a training camp). He tells his boss he's attending a 'shotgun wedding' and if you look real close you'll see that the e-mail address is hilaryclinton055.

Housed in a fetching book package, the BLU RAY picture quality varies from very good on the indoor sequences (bedrooms, cafes and sheds) to crystal clear and superlative on the outdoors shots (Afghanistan hills, London streets). As the dialogue is all Sheffield in Northern England and comes at you fast and furious, the lone ENGLISH SUBTITLE will probably be more than handy for overseas viewers. The extras include DELETED SCENES and 2 featurettes. The deleted scenes are short, but wickedly funny, while the 2 featurettes are unrelated to the film itself, but act as background to the project. First is a real-life documentary called ""Lost Boys"" which follows 4 Pakistani lads in a car as they drive around their hometown of Nelson in Lancashire. They talk of fights, racism and persecution - nothing to do every night. You can just see how they're ripe for recruitment. The 2nd is even stranger - an interview with Ahmad who is a white lad accused of Muslim extremism and arrested under the Terrorist Act. He shows paintings that express what he feels about Islam (deeply loves it). Neither feature makes judgements - but they do give you insights into why stuff happens...

To sum up - with our media and politicians locked into a sort of sickening and stifling political-correctness of late - material like ""Four Lions"" is refreshing to say the least - and even a bit brave. And the fact that you're laughing so much for three quarters of the movie, but hurting with sadness at the end - is testament to its heart. It elevates ""Four Lions"" above clever froth into the realm of something that stays with you - and makes you think - and reassess...

I loved this film. And Film 4, Wild Bunch and Optimum Releasing - and all associated with ""Four Lions"" - are to be praised to the nines for it.",1325548800,15,5836,4.680311890838206

4155117,5,B003M8OHVU,"Hapless Muslim inhabitants of Sheffield England get it into their heads that they want to become Islamic terrorists and strike back against the big bad West.  Two go so far as to travel to Pakistan and get training in an Al Quaeda camp--which goes quite wrong as one attempts to shoot down a drone and ends up killing their fellow terrorists!  After returning to England, they hit upon the idea of inserting themselves into the London marathon as suicide bombers while attired in bulky and comic costumes in order to hide their explosive apparatus.  But the ""Lads"" either loose their nerve or surcome to confusion and doubt as they try to pull it off.

A large part of the charm (if I dare call it such!) of this darkly comedic film is the working-class North British (and profanity-laced) speech of its protagonists.  Other reviewers rightly observe that their accents are quite thick and sometimes difficult to understand.  For somebody like myself, who has enjoyed speaking with many British friends and colleagues over the years (including one from Sheffield), hearing this picturesque speech is a joy in and of itself!  This speech also adds to the irony of their terrorist intentions, as their speech betrays how deeply they are immersed in the country into which they wish to induce mayhem.

I should make one final note: another wonderful British film that takes place in Sheffield is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Full-Monty/dp/6305622914/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Full Monty</a>.",1322006400,2,1543,5.4
4155118,4,B003M8OHVU,"If nothing else, you've gotta' give Chris Morris and his filmmaking crew credit for audaciousness; after all, it isn't every day of the week that someone writes and directs a comedy about a ragtag collection of Islamic terrorists who have all the spazziness and ineptitude of The Three Stooges.  The number of stooges has been expanded by one for ""Four Lions,"" a movie guaranteed to turn off a sizable portion of the moviegoing public who will find precious little to laugh about when it comes to the subject of terrorism.  And it probably won't sit too well with many Islamic moderates either, who may view Morris' portrayal of their religion as decidedly unhelpful at this particular moment in time.  But it is, of course, the nature and function of satire to shock its audience out of its bourgeois complacency, and ""Four Lions"" certainly does that in spades.

Riz Aiimed plays Omar, the Robin Hood to this merry band of would-be jihadists who, when they aren't skulking through their quiet suburban English neighborhood collecting materials for explosives, plotting attacks, and even blowing themselves up through acts of random carelessness, are bickering over who has the best plan to bring down the Great Satan (some want to blow up a local mosque to inspire fence-sitting moderate Muslims to join in the cause, while Omar believes it counter-productive to attack their own people).

Despite the fact that we admire the movie's boldness, for large stretches of the film, we find ourselves questioning the why-and-the-wherefore of Morris' vision (Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain co-wrote the screenplay).  Though the acting is excellent (particularly by Aiimed), and the handheld camera lends an impressive immediacy to the scene, there doesn't seem to be much point beyond showing how small-minded, petulant and incompetent these particular terrorists are.  Since real terrorists are unlikely to be bumbling by nature, I'm not exactly sure what satiric point Morris thinks he's making, since all good satire should arise organically from a basis in truth.

That being said, I would be remiss if I didn't concede that there are indeed some very funny moments in this movie.  The crew's bumping along in a rickety car filled with explosives over what must clearly be the most rutted road in all of England is a true comic highlight.  Morris' talent for extracting comedy out of the darkest of situations shines through both the performances and the dialogue - which I might add is often incomprehensible due to the thickness of the Cockney accents (ironically, it's easier to understand the actors when they're speaking in subtitled Arabic than in non-subtitled English).  And the sheer surrealistic absurdity of the finale proves that even the most horrific of situations can have their humorous elements - a bizarre comment indeed on the Human Condition.",1320192000,2,2858,5.124731182795699

Poking fun at the lowest of low-life fundamental extremists, who famously have no sense of humor, is quite courageous of writer-director Christopher Morris. Indeed, his script actually makes you almost like these assembled characters, each with a different idea of what they're trying to accomplish. My favorite was Waj (Kayvan Novak), the idiot of the bunch who only wants to belong. The bickering among them, usually instigated by Barry (Nigel Lindsey) is a riot. Also fine are the brains of the group, Omar (Riz Ahmed) and hunk Hassan (Arsher Ali). As I watched, I was convinced that Morris had inspiration from the very American mockumentaries of Christopher Guest.""Four Lions"" is certainly unique; I can't think of another film so daring. I hope the cast and film-makers aren't murdered in their sleep. Some reviews suggested English subtitles, but I had little trouble understanding the very funny banter.

However you can find the English subtitles on the Web. The subtitles were faithful to the dialogue but you'll probably have to adjust the synchronization. All that extra effort will pay off.

None

(1.)

(3.) Third indicator: A confused storyline with no identity. It couldn't decide if it was primarily a comedy or a contemporary tragedy.
(4.) Fourth: Acting was nonexistent -  just extemporaneous conversational ""what-should-I-say-now"".

4155127,5,B003M8OHVU,"One of those films that took me by complete surprise, `Four Lions' is a pitch perfect `dark comedy' that delivers one laugh after another with an unexpected touch of poignancy that elevates the material to create something special.

`Four Lions' details the haphazard terrorist plot conceived by five dimwitted Jihadi suicide bombers.  Mainly focusing on three conflicting personalities (Omar, Waj and Barry), `Four Lions' takes a stab at the root (or roots) of terrorism; exposing the allegiance and trivial stupidity that steeps itself in the act.  Omar and Barry butt heads from the start.  Both are leaders (self-proclaimed as they may be) and both expect a degree of servitude.  Omar is arrogant, considering himself superior in intellect (and most likely he is), while Barry is abrasive and condescending in his own right; using his brutish demeanor to demand a faux respect.  Waj is more of a simpleton; completely confused by his own allegiance.  He wants to believe in something but he can't commit his heart to their actions.  Instead, he becomes a pawn; taken advantage of by the more dominant personalities.  By focusing on these three characters, `Four Lions' shows the polar sides of terrorism; the way that influence can overtake both and strong and the weak.  As these characters devise their plot against oppression, they struggle to explain themselves and thus struggle to convince themselves that what they are doing is really the right thing to do.

As an intellectual piece, `Four Lions' is far smarter and deeper than one may expect.  It is a blatant farce, an unapologetic comedy and yet it is laced with such stark realism.  That said, it is the comedic shamelessness that really makes this film so incredible.  The script is one of the best I've seen put to use on the big screen in a long while.  The sharpness of the dialog is perfectly complimented by the visual antics.  The explosions never lack in comedic weight, and the one-liners delivered are side-splittingly hysterical.

""I'm not confused brother! I just took picture of my face, and it's deffo not my confused face.""

The repartee between the actors is also borderline genius.  Everyone totally gets their respective roles and they go `no holds bar', attacking the characters without hesitation.  Best in show props go directly to Nigel Lindsay, who layers Barry's ignorance with such undeniable wit.  He's pitch perfect in every scene.

In the end, I can't recommend this movie enough.  It is controversial, sure, but it understands how to approach the subject so as not to `cross the line' while simultaneously `crossing it'.  Taking jabs at both sides of the `war on terrorism', `Four Lions' feels real and authentic despite the outlandish nature of the whole thing.  It's preposterous, but on the other hand it's so crazy it just might be true!",1304467200,55,2836,5.0085470085470085
4155128,4,B003M8OHVU,"But I chuckled.  A lot.

A group of disaffected Pakistanis in England, led by a imam who is a converted Brit decide that they must leave their mark on history.  Apparently, that mark is a bloody and slightly smeared footnote.  Two of our characters get the call to go off to an Al Qaeda training camp in Pakistan.  Meanwhile the white imam continues to plot to blow up a mosque to mobilize the Muslim population against the non-believers.  When the aspiring jihadis return, the group begins to plot their great blow for their faith.  Needless to say, it doesn't go quite as planned.

It's hard to go into the gags without spoilers, but most of them stem from two sources.  First, some of the silly notions harbored by terrorist wannabes, like flailing your head around to keep surveillance cameras from getting a good shot of you.  The others came from inept use of explosives.  This is the part that isn't for everyone, as some of the gags were... um... lethal.  And messy.

The humor isn't fast paced, and is often in fairly macabre and surreal juxtapositions.  I'm OK with this, but many might not be.  The imam's passing is especially ironic and might not work for many.  And they did try to put a human (and not always stupid) face on the British Muslims.  The scenes of the lead character's homelife showed some of the inconsistancies of actual terrorists.

I suspect the Germans don't want to give the Nazis any credit, and I think that's the path Chris Morris has taken with his cell of British terrorists.

The stumble-bum efforts approach slapstick, and the comic timing is brilliant. Morris's lens extends beyond the cell itself, into Omar's family and how proud they are of his goals; the cell leader's dull colleague; and the police.

4155133,4,B003M8OHVU,"Note: Paragraph 2 is a synopsis, and only paragraph 5 that contains spoilers.

Four Lions is a daring little comedy with balls of iron. Using terrorism as a source of comedy maybe one of the hardest methods to make people ponder about this important issue. Especially the way that Director Chris Morris pursues the subject, one often fears that the topic may be used as the butt of jokes, and form a debased comedy. I have no clue how Morris does it, but he never crosses the moral/ethical line of GLORIZING the terror or demeaning the victims.

This comedy is based on a group of extremist Muslims who decide to demonstrate in the face of all this consumerism and corruption of the West, the beauty of their religion by commiting horrible deeds-that in their eyes are nothing but noble. Take note that they are from Sheffield, England. Four of the men are identifiably Muslim, but one stands out like a nerd on the football team. He is a white convert to Islam, and the most radical, impatient, and extreme of the pack-trying to convince them to attack a Mosque. Two members, Omar and Waj, get sent to a terrorist training camp with disastrous result-keep watching after the credits to understand the extent of their tragic contribution. After returning, all five, which includes the new recruit Hassan, decide to find a target to express their rage.

These are not organized or trained newbie terrorists. They act independently on their dogma, and hilarity ensues. They are also quite well rounded, unlike the terrorist picture many of us may imagine: isolated people lacking in friends, and lovable family. Omar, for example, has a son, wife, and quite a large group of friends-many which are British. They have no detailed philosophy besides the idea that this consumer Western society is corrupt, and needs to be punished. There is almost no discussion of Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, or any terrorist organization. However, They strive to be Jihadists, and ascend to Heaven. It's that simple in their eyes. No discussion of their victims ever take place, and for good reason. These characters are simplistic in their desires, so even a superficial thought of their victims innocence may thwart their plans.

Chris Morris reportedly has done years of research for this film, predating the 7/7 London Bombings. Unfortunately, we don't see the fruits of his research directly on screen. If his research finds its way in to the final cut of this film, it must be very subliminal because I could not see any evidence that this was deeply researched. Due to his research which included collecting personal account from countless different sources, it seems that Morris at parts is unable to shed light on the emotional aspects. Truths that are self-evident to him are not necessarily evident to us, and certain aspects require more emotional investment.

Many examples of such emotionally ambivalent scenes are spread throughout the film, however they are most evident during the scenes involving Omar's family. Of Course, Omar's son does not know about his father's true intents, but he is teaching his son the moral reason for his task through Disney's Lion King. After their overseas debacle, he explains to him that Simba must lie for now until he can accomplish his true goal. These intimate scenes are done well, as we begin to realize that these men are not hopeless young teens without futures. One of the most out of place scenes occurs after Omar deserts his fellow brothers, disappointed and depressed about their plans. His wife's word about his plans, and eventual demise, are so cold heartedly encouraging that we suddenly recall this is a piece of fiction. She seems to be actually encouraging and advocating his plan, clearly aware that its execution will leave her without a husband, and her son a father. Before this scene we saw these two adults use a water gun to  force a friend out of their house.  They may share the same ideas about the ""depravity"" of Western culture, but they are a loving couple. Morris, in this scene, makes the woman out to be absolutely heartless about her husband, and maybe ready to get rid of him by granting his services to the Lord in Heaven.  This scene is made all the more preposterous by the inclusion of their son in this conversation. Another complaint maybe that the wife is simply a foil character with nothing worthwhile to express. As said before, Morris has done much research on this topic, and maybe the families of terrorists are as ""open-minded"" as this, willing to give up their husbands, and parents in the Lord's service. Even if this is the case, Morris needs to stray from his facts, and show more compassion in these scenes, or progress to this line of though gradually, not spontaneously.

Four Lions also suffers from a smug sense of profundity. It often feels that the film believes besides laughs it is giving us an earnest and deeply insightful view about terrorism. Whenever Morris decides to make his work more insightful, the comedy suffers drastically. True, we are talking about people blowing themselves and others up by explosives, yet a truly comedic tone fits this successful premise well. The film's serious moments are so far and in between that they never make the impact that he desires. A prime example is the concluding scene when Omar wants to make Waj, one of the co-conspirators, to give himself up. When this fails, Omar marches in to a pharmacy completing his mission. This serious scene steals from the comedy of the four men running around for twenty minutes in preposterous costumes ranging from Honey Munster to an ostrich. After this, a somber songs begins that is truly not in the spirit of the film. I believe Morris believed he had made a serious statement, like the one at the beginning and conclusion of American Beauty. Four Lions loses it's touch, and becomes somewhat disjointed from its black comedy elements when it choses to take such a drastically different route.

Despite all this criticism, I found Four Lions to more insightful and original than most current comedies distributed in the last few years. Morris of course does not succeed in  all his goals, but miraculously saves himself from much criticism that his Brass Eye series received in the last decade. He looks at the issue at a very specific angle which makes the comedy, despite the subject, extremely funny. His characters are somewhat stupid and carless which are necessary elements for a film on such a bleak subject.  If only the bomber's of 7/7, and hijackers of 9/11, were as independent and clueless as these men are, the victims of their actions would be miniscule in number.",1299283200,,6655,4.858906525573192
