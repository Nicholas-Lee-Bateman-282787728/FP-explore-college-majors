8450647,3,B00502BBW4,"I am from the Pacific Northwest and thought this would be a great video to work out to on the treadmill.  I loved the scenery but the choppy editing needs work because it bounces you all over to different scenes too frequently.  One minute you are by a waterfall, the next on a forest trail, the next under a rocky ledge trail.  It would have been better if they would have started at Point A on a trail and stayed on it until they made it to Point B on the same trail instead of integrating all of the different forest scenes all jumbled together as closely as they did.",1376956800,2,571,4.172727272727273
8450648,2,B00502BBW4,"Unfortunately, I'm in the minority. I don't like this DVD anywhere near as much as other reviewers did.

PROS... beautiful scenery. Thank goodness I can toggle off the music, rapidly clicking drumsticks and crashing cymbals. It's a much faster pace than the rainforest DVD - good for cycling and running, but not walking.

CONS... this isn't a steady, relaxing hike. Every few seconds the pathway stops and begins somewhere else in another location. I like that the camera stops to enjoy the occasional waterfall, but then you're suddenly whisked away to another area entirely. There's really no way to ""lose yourself"" on this faux hike. One moment you're walking on a woodsy path, then you're whisked away to a bridge, then suddenly you're staring at the distant mountains, then you're transported to another wooden bridge, and then you`re back in the woods having never crossed the bridge. You're constantly reminded that you're viewing a film, as it jumps from point A to point B in a fraction of a second.

It isn't a solitary walk. You'll encounter dozens of hikers along the way who stare quizzically into the camera as it rushes passed them. During one hike the sunlight presents itself as a blue dot flashing through the trees. Very distracting.

Since all of these reviews are subjectively based on our tastes, and none of us are all right or all wrong, the best way to decide if you want to invest your money is to find someone who already owns the DVD. Check with your local library too. Borrow it before buying. To me, the Rainforest DVD was much better, but it probably wouldn't suit those who desire a more rigorous hike.",1357689600,10,1635,4.76678445229682
8450649,5,B00502BBW4,"An excellent workout. 30 minutes of high definition wide screen video with a 5 minute ""cooldown"". It is like you are actually right there, you can immerse yourself in the awesome scenery and not be watching the timer. Makes the workout very enjoyable instead of very boring. I am acquiring more and more of these Virtual Active DVDs as they get me looking forward to doing daily workouts.",1355702400,,388,4.720588235294118
8450650,5,B00502BBW4,While I am a bit biased since I live in the PNW I just love this hiking DVD. It starts off with the absolutely stunning Silver Falls and you are immediately enchanted. In fact it is hard for the rest of the hikes to compare to it but there is beauty in the perfect mirror reflection of Crater Lake that is worth viewing. I think hikers will love this video as I do. I only wish there were more videos around this area since there are so many possibilities.,1354320000,,456,4.134831460674158
8450651,5,B00502BBW4,"I always enjoy thee VirtualActive DVDs. This one is no exception. I had done VirtualActive - Pacific Northwest Hike previously. This one has lots of beautiful paths in the woods, by the ocean, and even around Crater Lake, gorgeous water falls that you just want to jump into and cool off about then, and lots more, all worth seeing. It's just beautiful.

I chose the Pacific Northwest ""Run"" earlier and reviewed it. I wanted it because I enjoyed going there a few years ago and thought it might be nice to revisit the area this way. It was. All of my favorite places were there, the waterfront, the marketplace, the streets around our hotel. There were other places that I hadn't gone but wished I had. Gorgeous narrow wooded paths with waterfalls, Mt. St. Helens in the distance. It was an enjoyable ""run"".  The ""run was my first 'Virtual Active' DVD. I have almost all of them now, cycling, walking, and running DVDs. I enjoy using a different one for each workout, using my spinning bike, elliptical, treadmill and/or a combination. I love them all! I like the selection of the location and the very pleasant commentary. I especially enjoyed the sounds of nature. Music is also an option as well. I'm learning to appreciate the fact that the music helps me keep up my cadence.

I try to allow myself only one selection/day and my workout is planned to be 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

The instructional hints were basic reminders. It was nice to have virtual 'company' going through the DVD the first time.",1328918400,5,1498,4.6415094339622645
