7926476,4,B00004Y563,"There were disappointing episodes and totally fantastic episodes of the X-Men cartoon series. Here we have the latter. Phew! The best stories of the series were those involving time travel and this is exactly what we've got here. Another interesting plot point is the pairing of Wolverine and Storm in the alternate universe, and personally I think they made a really great couple. Shame it didn't happen in the regular universe. This video is definitely worth the buy if you want to see the best of the X-Men. It's just a shame that they're are only two episodes. This can put you off buying it if you're not sure how good it is, but I'm telling you it's brilliant, so now you can buy it!",1029369600,,689,4.52
7926477,5,B00004Y563,"This is an excellent purchase considering there are 6 episodes on this one tape.  Simply enough of an X-Men fix for anyone.  But seriously, this vhs tape captures six episodes of the classic X-Men cartoon from the early 1990's.  At the time that this cartoon was released, this animation was pretty much state of the art.  IMHO, the art still holds up very well, and I prefer this series to the newer X-Men cartoon that is currently being broadcast.  As I've noted, there are six episodes on this tape.  The first two episodes are the Savage Land series.  Beast, Jubilee, Wolverine, and Storm travel to the Savage Land where they battle Sauron and the mysterious Garokk.  These episodes guest star Ka-Zar.  The X-Men must free the Savage Land first from the tyrranical grip of Sauron while unravelling the mystery of the stone spirit of the Savage Land.  I found these episodes to be enjoyable, but the lack of Cyclops was a big downer for me.  The last four episodes consist of the Dark Phoenix Saga. These are absolutely brilliant.  The cartoon accurately recaptures the Dark Phoenix Saga from the comic books, one of the all time great stories.  Dazzler makes a guest appearance.  More importantly, these episodes feature the Hell Fire Club.  Jason Wyngaarde, with help from the White Queen, corrputs Phoenix's mind, seemingly turning her against the X-Men.  The mental manipulation twists Phoenix's mind, turning the spirit towards evil.  The Imperial Guard intervenes, and the X-Men must fight a battle royale for the fate of Phoenix and more importantly, Jean Grey.  This is great stuff, capturing the personalities of all the X-Men.
The video print is very nice.  The tape is relatively clear and is of excellent quality.  There is little trace of any decay from the master and there is little or no static anywhere on the print.  The soundtrack is solid for a cartoon.  If memory serves, this was one of the first tv cartoons that was recorded in stereo.
Overall, if you are an X-Men fan, I'd recommend this tape.  If you can only afford to buy one vhs tape of the X-Men cartoon, this is the one for you.",995155200,18,2112,4.741758241758242
7926478,5,B00004Y563,"Pretty action packed episode. Based on AOA(Age of Apocalypse) story from 1995. I personally would have preffered to seen more of the action during the actual Alternate reality, but the episode was great none the less. Cameos during the AOA reality included, Sinister,Holocaust,Sabretooth,Wildchild,Nightcrawler,Mimic,Morph,Sunfire,Cargill. Superhuman adversaries were Giant Man,Wasp,Black Widow, and others. There were of course the AOA versions of regular X-Men like Rogue,Beast,and Jean Grey, all led by ""The Leader"" Magneto. A little twist from the comic, but a very good cartoon rendition.",992476800,3,593,6.156626506024097
7926479,5,B00004Y563,"This episode of X-Men is based on Chris Claremont's work on Early X-Men. I'm glad to see such works reused again for another Generation of kids and adults to see. Very good story. Of Moria's son who is a mutant, and who is not reality friendly. Her son is able to distort reality around himself. A very imaginative story, about when this boy goes on the loose.",992304000,,360,4.388059701492537
7926480,5,B00004Y563,"This video is actually the television incarnation of the After Xavier:  The Age of Apacalypse.  Like all episodes, the television bends it in a different direction.  It begins with Logan and Storm in love.  We then see AOA versions of the characters fighting to save Magneto.  Fitzroy goes to kill Xavier, but Bishop and Shard go and get Logan and Storm to help stop and make Fitzroy realize the future that he is bringing.  With Bishop traveling home, it leads into the Beyond Good and Evil Storyline.",991267200,2,502,4.712643678160919
7926481,5,B00004Y563,"I love these two episodes, having seen them on Fox a long while back. In my oppinion they're a couple of the best, of course, I loved the entire series. The Wolverine/Storm paring is awesome, and Bishop is one of my favorite X-Men, not to mention Xavier, whose voice actor I love... The plot is great, and the end of part one is a great cliffhanger, too bad part two's right after it, it was fun having to wait a week to find out what happend, made you appreciate the plot more. :) Anyway, I reccomend this video to any X-Men fan, young or old.",991094400,,544,4.190476190476191
7926482,5,B00004Y563,"These episodes are great. I love the dark phoenix. jean grey  was amazing in this. I've never seen such power in jean. That episode left me breathless. I couldn't get out of my seat the whole time. The dark phoenix is one of the most powerful forces i've seen in the x-men.
Savage land/Strangeheart is a heavy episode. Seeing storms powers is overwhelming. I always new she had a lot of rage in her. She is one of the most powerful x-men. She's like a mother  to all the x-men, she's not afraid of anything. Also Maybe i've missed it, but i've never seen a story about her past. I've seen everyone else's but hers.",972777600,7,614,4.3304347826086955
