8579177,3,B00CAEIE0W,"This is a cheesy 80's film. In a badly dubbed NYC body parts are going missing and it appears to be the work of people from Kito, a South East Asian island. A small group goes to the island because....if makes a film. The island is filled with cannibals who prefer to eat raw innards or a nice stew. Oh yeah, there is a handful of zombies too. Yes they ransacked Laurie's apartment to steal a knife she had hanging on the wall. Bad rubber parts.

Of course when a pretty blonde is capture by a group of ""savages"" they must be stripped naked like Bo Derek or Ursala Andress.  Don't blame me, I don't make the rules. Alexandra Delli Colli is a natural blonde.",1414800000,,657,4.248
