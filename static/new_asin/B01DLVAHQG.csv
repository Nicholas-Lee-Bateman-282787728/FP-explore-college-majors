7719616,5,B01DLVAHQG,"The second cycle of ""The Hollow Crown"" focuses on the Wars of the Roses, beginning with William Shakespeare's ""Henry VI"" parts 1 & 2 (this version includes parts 2 & 3 in its adaptation of part 2) and ""Richard III"". Director Dominic Cooke successfully continues the style that Richard Eyre began in cycle one's ""Henry IV"" and Thea Sharrock further developed in ""Henry V"". In this cycle, Sophie Okonedo stands out the most as Queen Margaret as she's in all of the films and can fully develop her character and demonstrate change over time. Beyond that, her steely reserve is the perfect counterpoint to Benedict Cumberbatch, who delightfully chews his lines as villain Richard III. Hugh Bonneville, Tom Sturridge, Judi Dench, Stanley Townsend, and Michael Gambon all turn in great performances and add to the overall quality of this series. This is the perfect follow-up to the first cycle of ""Hollow Crown"" films and, with a single director and more overlap in actors for all the films, it's a more cohesive series.",1515283200,,1015,4.906976744186046

The Hollow Crown is well done, superbly casted and since it was filmed in England there were many beautiful places where it was filmed.  Benedict Cumberbatch was wonderfully easy to hate as Richard III.  Dame Judy Dench was, as always, amazing.",1514937600,,396,4.614285714285714
7719618,1,B01DLVAHQG,"gah! why am i giving an otherwise (mostly) exceptional collection of shakespeare's histories such a low rating?

because this blu-ray is so poorly and cheaply put together, you'd almost think that someone downloaded the plays illegally, burned them to disk with win-dvd, and sold you a pirated disk on ebay. no menus, no chapters, no scene selections.

since there are no special features on the disks, and the video quality seems the same as the dvd (which i bought for the first set - richard 2, henry 4/1, henry 4/2, and henry 5), there's no benefit at all in buying the blu-ray version.",1511308800,7,590,4.718446601941747

7719625,5,B01DLVAHQG,"The BEST of the many Richard III (Shakespeare) versions I've seen (and there have been *many*).  Benedict Cumberbatch imbues the arch-villain of Shakespeare's histories with humanity and vulnerability: RIII is a damaged soul, born of years of war and death and treachery, and we see him slowly, inexorably descend into madness.

Production values for the three histories in this set are very high. Cinematography, costuming, editing, all excellent. But best of all, EVERY actor in this production is at the top of their form, and seeing Dame Judy Dench portray Richard's mother, Cecily, is a delight.

If you ever have any interest in seeing Shakespeare's Wars of the Roses histories/RIII, this should be the one. Laurence Olivier should have been half as fine as Benedict Cumberbatch. Honestly.",1502668800,3,795,5.244094488188976

7719662,4,B01DLVAHQG,"This  production follows the Shakespeare plays, and it does a fine job of that. However, with all due respect to Shakespeare, for modern audiences, I would have preferred to see  a re-telling based strictly on the history. As great as Shakespeare may be, that prose is extremely difficult for the modern audience to follow. With the recent discovery of the remains of Richard III, not to mention the success of the series ""Game of Thrones"", there has been a renewed interest in the War of the Roses.

7719668,5,B01DLVAHQG,"I've always had a hard time following Shakespeare and therefore remain fairly devoid of reading his plays.  However watching this series I was very impressed with the fact that I could follow along and actually understand what was happening and what Shakespeare's intent was in writing this play. The diversity of the cast didn't bother me at all as it has some reviewers....I thought the acting was outstanding.  Cumberbatch is worth the price of admission, Stanley Townsend as Warwick was great, he's a big screen presence although probably fairly unknown here in the states.  The actual battle scenes, castle backgrounds, etc., were worthy of a big film production.  I was blown away that this was a PBS production.  Very watchable and very engaging.  Plus I actually learned a little along the way.",1484784000,,802,5.037878787878788
7719669,1,B01DLVAHQG,"This was literally unwatchable.  I loved the first series of the Hollow Crown, even though I thought Tom Hiddleston was poorly casted as Henry V.  Tom just didn't have enough of a manly presence, but he put in a big dramatic effort and overcame the casting mismatch.  This series was completely miscast and the acting was for the high school stage.  I've read the history plays at least three times and Richard III at least six times and  something that you have to understand is that Richard is an attractive character, he's sly and witty, funny and seductive.  He is evil, but his viciousness is almost eclipsed by the venal, ambitious, sycophantic, self-serving members of the royal court.  Cumberbatch and the director contrived to make him into a repellant monster, both physically hideous and dramatically so.  I couldn't finish watching the movie, it was so, so bad.  How can the BBC take such a brilliant series like the first Hollow Crown and just trash it.  What a shame.",1484438400,5,981,4.785714285714286

7719676,5,B01DLVAHQG,"I recently retired from a teaching career which involved the teaching of Shakespeare as well as English history. The Wars of the Roses has been a major focus of my reading and research for nearly forty years, and I believe I've seen every film version made of Shakespeare's *Richard III*, yet whenever I get the chance, I tell my former students they will probably never see a better portrayal of Richard III than that of Benedict Cumberbatch in their lifetime. I have memorized some of the play's passages, but when I hear Cumberbatch render the lines, I see he's placing a nuance on the words that show his amazing talent at presenting what Shakespeare probably intended for his characters. Sophie Okenedo's portrayal of Margaret of Anjou also exceeds all that have come before hers, and were it not for Cumberbatch's powerful art, she would have stolen the show. The cinematography was fabulous as well. My only disappointment (and it is a wee one) was the depiction of Richard's wooing of Anne Neville. This was not the fault of the actors, but portraying the burial of a dead king in a spooky grove of trees at some distance from the castle with a scruffy grave marker is so far from medieval practice that it is counter-instructional for student viewers, but the choice of a dark, remote setting without the accompanying bier carriers does enhance the mood that the actors create for this very famous scene from Shakespeare, so I can still accept it. Teachers showing this to students might be ready to supplement the understanding of the age with a brief explanation of royal burial customs in medieval England along with images of King Henry's actual burial site (chosen by Richard III) in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. All in all, though, this is a wonderful rendering of the play and I will watch it again and again as time goes by.",1482710400,4,1851,4.751552795031056

I have read the plays, and know the basic history, and seen Richard III a few times....yet, I had trouble sorting out who was White Rose, and who wore the Red Rose -- not to mention which duke/earl was on which side -- they did change allegiance as the 3 plays continued.  Nonetheless, the acting, the use of England's famous old churches, castles and so forth, and the shifting sands of pro/ con keep you interested and wondering what happens next.

Then there is Mr. Cumberbatch, as Richard III.  You get the yin and the yang, the ugly and the creepy beauty, and you cannot stop watching him. For the first time, I truly understood My kingdom for a horse! line: the extremely deformed Richard III lacking a horse is unable to stand on his own in a muddy, open battlefield, and by that time, NO ONE wanted to get near to him.

7719685,2,B01DLVAHQG,"Haven't seen R III with Cumberbatch yet but the 2 Henry VI plays left me feeling disappointed.  They cut crucial scenes:  EG when King Henry learns of Gloucester's death he first angrily dismisses Suffolk, as the messenger delivering bad news (but ironically we the viewer know he is responsible for Gloucester's death), then calls him back in grief and despair, hoping that Suffolk would then put him (Henry) out of his misery. This scene is Shakespeare at his best, but was not in ""Hollow Crown"".

See instead the BBC Shakespeare plays from the 1980's [...]);  Peter Benson as Henry VI, Ron Cook as Richard III, and Bernard Hill (""Lord of the Rings"", ""Titanic"") as Duke of York did a very good job.

In ""Hollow Crown"" the performance by Sturridge of King Henry seems to be missing something, that Peter Benson in the BBC version excellently delivers.

And in BBC version Julia Foster as Margaret of Anjou is cackling hysterically on a pile of dead bodies, at the end of Richard III.  Chilling performance and fantastic ending.

There's also a recent Globe version which I haven't seen yet: [...]

7719686,5,B01DLVAHQG,"THIS REVIEW CONCERNS THE TWO SEASONS

The first ""volume covers Richard II, Henry IV, Part I and Part II, and Henry V. The second volume covers Henry VI, Part I and Part II and Richard III. These plays by Shakespeare have been adapted, the most concerned being Henry VI reduced from three parts to two.

I will not enter the historic content since I have already covered that with the BBC collection of the Complete Shakespeare, play after play. What is important is to see what this new production  and adaptation  brings us, and I must say it brings a lot.

First the language is still Shakespeares but the pronunciation has been modernized so that we can follow the text a lot better. By modernized I mean some archaic pronunciations have been dropped and the rhythmic pattern does not dictate the tempo and balance of the language. Instead of the traditional at times forced iambic diction this new production uses a more fluent and common linguistic flow that is closer to what we know and hear everyday. Of course when the poetic or archaic syntax is respected that produces strange sentences but since it flows more naturally we can deal with that. For those who are not conversant in Shakespearean English, post middle and pre modern English, the subtitles are there to help even if at times they are too abundant when the speech is particularly fast. But I am sure that a second watching would make that English perfectly clear, and for those who have some practice they should be up to it in about fifteen minutes at the most. Then I would suggest you use that language in everyday life for fun or entertainment.

The second improvement is the fact the whole series is shot in real settings, both natural and built. Hence we are really feeling  with our eyes  the coarse and rough stone castles, including the Tower of London. The insides are not always authentic since some palaces like Westminster Palace is no longer what it used to be, especially because of Big Ben. Same remark about Westminster Abbey which is nowadays overloaded inside with artifacts and all kinds of accumulated tombs, plates and other memorials. But the inside scenes are shot in real settings even if they are not authentic. I guess you see the difference. We definitely left plywood fake ramparts and battlements behind. That makes the series believable. We do not have to suspend our disbelief as for the setting itself.

The third improvement is that the actors are modern actors who are used to work for cinema productions. They are very flexible, expressive and emotional. Some may regret they don't cry that much but crying is not necessarily the best way to express grief. Facial language and body language are pretty nice too along that line and probably more realistic. We do not cry that much in real life. They are also dressed with costumes that must be lighter and that are definitely easier to wear. That also helps the production and makes it light, effective and even impressive.

The last improvement is that it is a cinema production done for High Definition TV and whats more color. So the series can use the full palette of colors when necessary though in the popular scenes with Falstaff, for example, and battles the dominant colors are brown and grey, sometimes black. But they can easily use red for spilling blood for instance and the red rose can really be red instead of dark grey or black. This production can also work on small details since modern flat TV plasma screen can include small details due to the size and the definition of the screen. That really improves the pleasure you way get with the very active scenes and with pageants or inside scenes that provides a lot of detail.

But at the same time this production is an adaptation and special effects permit to have a real burning stake for Joan of Arc and enable the action to be realistic and fast. You will not always notice the scenes that are cut in the original, though you should see the battle of Orleans has been entirely cut off at the beginning of Henry VI Part One. But most of the time you will not really see the difference except if you know the original plays very well. I am just going to give one example at the end of Richard III, the famous ghost scene or nightmare that is in the original doubled with the positive dreams of the future Henry VII. This scene is essential because it testifies of Shakespeares great art that invest some symbolical forms in his plays. The last battle is in 1485 at Bosworth. The numerical symbols are 1+8 = 9, 4+5 = 9, 1+4+8+5 = 18 = 9x2. The numerical symbol or key of Richard III is NINE, the devilish number of them all: Jesus time of death, the ninth hour, the Beast in the Apocalypse, and many other diabolical and deadly values.

In the nightmare NINE is necessary to complete the prophecy, the prediction, by identifying the beast, in this case Richard the Third before the battle. And sure enough the ghosts are going to curse Richard III with a simple formula: despair and die. And in that ghost scene this mantra is repeated NINE times. You can note too the characters who are haunting Richard III and alternately lauding Henry of Richmond.

1- Prince Edward, son to Henry the Sixth: despair, therefore, and die;
2 & 3- King Henry the Sixth: despair and die despair and die;
4- Clarence: despair and die;
5 & 6- Rivers, Grey and Vaughan: despair and die despair and die;
7- Hastings: despair and die;
8- the two young princes, sons of Edward IV: despair and die;
9- Queen Anne: despair and die;
- Buckingham: .

In this adaptation the number of ghosts is reduced and the number of repetitions of the mantra is also reduced though the presence of Henry VIs wife Margaret (who is not a ghost) holding a mirror in which Richard III sees the ghosts is a brilliant idea, though of course it prevents the parallel lauding apparitions to Henry of Richmond who has nothing to do with Margaret. I guess the research teams did not read my study of Richard III published at the end of the 1990s in France but in English where I pushed that element a lot farther than what I just said. We must understand that in Elizabethan times, after the Reformation and in the ascending phase of chapels and Puritanism, such biblical references were unavoidable elements that everyone understood and appreciated. Whats more it is very effective in the propaganda (rather self-justification) of the Tudors: the killing of the crucifixion with 4 (in this case of the evil character, hence an anti-Passion) is prophesied; the Second Coming is announced with 8 (this time Henry of Richmond, the savior of England); and the Beast is identified with 9 (Richard III), all contained in the date of the battle itself. And 5 is no better as for the diabolical value it carries. We are in the midst of medieval numerical symbolism directly inherited from Romanesque culture and alchemy.

This final battle is Bosworth which is supposedly in Old English a proper name Bosa + worth. I am not entirely satisfied by this meaning and I recognize in /bos-/ the root of Anglo-Saxon bosm, Middle English bosom, an old Germanic root:

bosom (n.)  Old English bosm ""breast; womb; surface; ship's hold,"" from West Germanic *bosm- (source also of Old Frisian bosm, Old Saxon bosom, Middle Dutchboesem, Dutch boezem, Old High German buosam, German Busen ""bosom, breast""), perhaps from PIE root *bhou- ""to grow, swell,"" or *bhaghus ""arm"" (in which case the primary notion would be ""enclosure formed by the breast and the arms""). Narrowed meaning ""a woman's breasts"" is from 1959; but bosomy""big-breasted"" is from 1928. Bosom-friend is attested 1580s; bosom buddy from 1920s. (http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bosom, accessed December 6, 2016)

The name Bosworth must have been meaningful for Shakespeare, especially with bosom-friend appearing in his period. We then can understand this battle is worth a lot to the heart of anyone who believes the Tudors have brought peace and prosperity to England, since the heart is directly in the breast, the bosom on which my bosom friend can rest his head in my hugging arms, note the space between my hugging arms and my breast or chest is the bosom.

Of course this is elaborate and subtle. It was probably well understood by the greater part of the audience of the Globe Theater but it is lost today, and thats probably why this production has modified the end of the play Richard III, but I regret it because it turns the Shakespearean magic into some plain action film, even if it is a good one.

I don't see too many times a performance of the plays that take place during the 'War of the Roses' and they are in their method and period, a marvel to speak to us of the political climate and influence. How plays were dictated. Who the victors and heroes were established to be, glossing over the mistakes made by some of these varied rulers who had the crown.

For what it is worth, they were well done adaptations although if you're expecting the full play for every historical figure be it Henry VI or Richard III, that simply won't occur because scenes were cut for time. So it's abbreviated. Still, the best lines and most intriguing dialogue is there. It's worth watching. If you're not familiar with Shakespeare but enjoy history, this can be a bit disappointing. These plays are not historically accurate. They leave out critical details. They villainies when suited. For example, Shakespeare wrote Richard III to be a sadistic psychopath who murdered his brothers, tortured men on the field, killed his cousins, his wife, his nephews, his brother in law and the list goes on. What it leaves out that Anne Neville was said to have died of tuberculosis shortly after losing her son by Richard's who was crowned prince of Wales. The supposition that Richard would attempt to marry his niece is based on one letter that was only referenced and never documented as a historical fact.

But if you know that history, these plays can be awfully amusing, if you find the humor in such dramatic pieces. It was well acted and well done. And seeing Judi Dench in there as Duchess Cecily was also an added bonus.",1477872000,,1761,4.659163987138264
7719702,3,B01DLVAHQG,"I loved the first Hollow Crown series well enough to pre-order this installment as soon as it came available.  I watched this for the first time with a group who (except for me) had never seen most of the Henriad cycle and we were excited to see it being performed as a single piece.  During the watching we ended up doing a lot of pausing for me to explain who people were and what was going on (much more so than we did when this same group watched the first Hollow Crown series.)  I understand that the script need to be cut down to fit the allotted time, but the way the edits were made combined with the focus of the directing meant that much of the character-driven side of the story was cut to allow for more of the action.  I felt that much of the flow and power of the original was lost in this telling.  It was hard to understand why the characters made the choices they did and most of the thematic echos were also lost.  I was particularly disappointed in most of the female characters - some of which is down to the overall loss from the story editing and some of which is the result of the acting and directing choices: normally I consider the Henry VI stories to have some of the best female roles in Shakespeare but here I found myself either confused as to what was motivating them or sad that their parts were being cut.  Richard Duke of York, Warrick, Clifford, and Richard III himself also suffered loss to the understandability of their characters.

Overall, I don't regret having seen this but will probably not watch it a second time.  I will, however, be re-watching my BBC Shakespeare versions of the stories condensed into this series, and recommend them to anyone who is looking for understandable versions of Henry VI parts 1-3 and Richard III.  Sadly, there is no Region 1 DVD version with all of the Henry VI stories, so I can't link to them.",1477872000,6,1872,4.384393063583815

7719705,4,B01DLVAHQG,"Henry VI Part 1:
Following the death of King Henry V, his infant son is crowned king. Naturally Henry VI cannot rule so his uncle, the Duke of Gloucester (Hugh Bonneville), becomes Lord Protector. Henry V's conquests in France begin to slip away. Henry VI grows up but hardly seems like an adult among the lords of Parliament. Gloucester always acts with his nephew's best interests. Others strive to undermine his influence and take his place as trusted advisor. Some even maneuver to become king of England. The reconquest of France goes poorly (thanks a lot, Joan of Arc!), enabling further mischief and machinations in the royal court. Somerset (Ben Miles) finds a French noble wife for Henry, though she is more in Somerset's sway and has many more ambitions beyond being Henry's wife. Henry himself is a weak king. His interest in religion and prayer are a detriment to his royal duties. Like his father before him, he seems unfit to wear the crown. Unlike his father, he does not have a transformative experience into a warrior king, leaving Henry VI subject to whatever  political wind prevails. It's not a good situation and leads the country into civil war.

This second series of The Hollow Crown is subtitled The Wars of the Roses. In an early scene, Richard Plantagenet confers with a handful of other nobles. He has a claim to the throne and wants to find out who would back him. He plucks a white rose from a nearby bush. Others pluck white roses in support of him or red roses in support of Somerset from the house of Lancaster. The Duke of Gloucester is not there and he does remain the king's true servant, even after his wife is banished for consorting with the occult against Henry. Gloucester's enemies use this as an excuse to implicate Gloucester, with tragic results. By the end, Plantagenet makes his claim for the crown and rallies his sons, including his hunchbacked son also named Richard (Benedict Cumberbatch).

The political intrigue is more fascinating than I was anticipating. Backstabbing nobles don't always make the most interesting or compelling characters, but the writing is excellent and the characters well drawn. The actors are uniformly wonderful and deliver the Shakespearean dialogue with naturalness and conviction.

Henry VI Part 2:
The Wars of the Roses rages on as King Henry VI is assailed by the house of York with their claims as rightful ruler. Henry is too mild and pious to hold the crown on his own. His scheming wife Margaret is certainly more aggressive if not entirely faithful. They have a son, Edward, whom Henry disinherits in a moment of weakness while negotiating with the Duke of York. There are plenty of betrayals among the Yorks as well. The plot requires a bit of attention.

For a Shakespeare play, this production includes a lot of violence and bloody gore. There's no stagey-ness or skimping on the battle scenes. They show the full horror of battle. Coughing up blood happens a lot; many throats are slit. Heads are cut off and piked on the walls of cities (a common practice in dealing with traitors back then). So squeamish viewers need to beware.

The story moves along at a rapid pace, almost to the detriment of the storytelling. Loyalties reverse many times throughout the show, sometimes happening a bit too quickly to be believable. The story takes place over 15 or 16 years. Things slow down at the end as the focus shifts to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, (played well by Benedict Cumberbatch) who does the dirty work needed to ensure his brother, Edward IV, remains King of England. Richard will wind up as Richard III, the subject of the final movie in this series. The other actors do a good job as well. The story just looks stripped down to the bare bones.

This movie is better as a connective tissue between Part 1 and Richard III, I'm not sure that it can stand on its own as a story. Certainly it was produced as part of a trilogy, and Henry VI was originally three separate plays, so a lot of material was condensed to make it to the finale.

Richard III:
Richard III (Benedict Cumberbatch) rises to and falls from power in this adaptation of Shakespeare's popular play. Richard is a man of cunning and ambition with no apparent sense of goodness in him at all. He manipulates his family members and the nobility with horrifying ease and effectiveness, always redirected responsibility and guilt on others. He acknowledges his guilt to viewers (he makes many asides to the camera to clarify what he's really up to) and has no remorse. In spite of killing two brothers, two nephews, a wife, and a host of other nobles and relatives, he gets his comeuppance at the end.

The production is very elaborate. Scenes are filmed in historic locations and battles occur in towns and fields, giving the movie a very cinematic feel. Richard starts the movie with an aside to the camera (the ""Now is the winter of our discontent..."" speech) so his talking to the camera seems natural, though the previous episodes haven't had anyone speak directly to the camera since the Chorus actually appears at the end of Henry V. Since the story is an intimate portrayal of Richard, the asides work well.

On the other hand, just because it's intimate doesn't mean it's accurate. Critics of the play like to rail against it as Tudor propaganda (Henry VII beats Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth and winds up with the crown) and character assassination. Setting those (legitimate) concerns aside, this story gives a compelling picture of the most Machiavellian man ever. Dramatically it is very exciting and Cumberbatch gives a great performance, sliding around from fake meekness and icy calculation to moral outrage and anger with amazing ease. It's a great performance of Shakespeare's take on Richard III.

This is well worth watching and a fine end to the series.",1477180800,,5839,4.782738095238095

7719712,1,B01DLVAHQG,"This is a chainsawed and reimagined version of Henry VI (Parts 1, 2 and 3) plus Richard III. The Henry VI cycle of plays is cut up and reimagined into a two-part play refocused as the title would indicate on the ""war of the roses"". Lines are charged, scenes are rearranged and anything considered unimportant to the Lancaster/York narrative is cut out. Henry VI Part One is done with in around 50 minutes. The war is generally unimportant. Joan of Arc is reduced to a sparse cartoon character not faithful to the play at all. The other French characters don't count. To those who made the film, the most important pieces of part one were the battle scenes and joan being burned at the stake. The whole heart of Part One is lost. Jack Cade's rebellion is gone from part II which is finished with in around an hour. Its purpose is little more than to clear the decks for the actual civil war.

Given the treatment of the material, they would have done better to have simply gone to Henry VI part 3 immediately and dispensed with any adaptation of the first two parts. About all the first film does dramatically is establish York's motives and Warwick's character.

Ironically, the parts removed are parts that somewhat speak to the present. Jack Cade's populism run amok is VERY 2016 and so is Joan's fanaticism.

The ironic thing about the entire series is that it neglects what is important in the plays (the words, the drama, the acting) in favor of the visual image. Money has been poured into effects, into blood and into decapitations. The net effect is often that the visuals end up being a distraction to the drama and the acting. The effects people and set dressers end up producing a work so lavish that it overwhelms what is of actual value in the work. Words are removed so that we can watch blood flow on the ground or watch actors play with dead bodies or listen to a musical swell.  Henry gets a scene and he has to be visually naked in a field among a flock of sheep. Again, words overwhelmed by visuals.

Bur ironically enough for all the focus on the visuals, the series loses something important. It loses the sense of decay and fails to communicate the consequences of the civil war. The civil war visually seems to cause no decay at all. The cycle of plays is about England falling from being a rich empire including France to being an poor, broke shell of a kingdom. To not visually communicate that is to lose is the meaning of the thing.

Generally, the part of Henry VI is over-acted and in my opinion the whole approach to the character is wrong-headed. On the other hand, the best acting in the whole cycle of plays is Benedict Cumberbatch as Richard III. One thing I can fault him on is the stupid over-the-top leering into the camera at the end of the second part. Its bad acting and poor TV melodrama. But I would ascribe the fault to the director rather than to the actor.  The other thing I would fault is the absurd over-the-top physical presentation of his back. Judi Dench is cast in a part she is too old for (Cecily).

There is a scene where he is giving a great speech as Richard. But he is naked to the waist, looming over a chess board with expensive special effects on his back. Richard's back is a case where ""less is more"". The whole scene, minus the acting and the words, looks visually like something out of game of Thrones rather than Richard III. Maybe that is what people want, but that doesn't mean what they want is any good.

The strange thing about the production is why, in the course of spending so much money, they didn't follow through and do the whole thing right. Given all the money spent on sets, the incremental money necessary to a full presentation of the four plays would not have been that much more. Maybe two hours more. I mean in the first cycle they produced a full adaptation of Richard II. If they could afford to do that, why not carry through with a full adaption of the Henry VI plays? Its also unfortunate that nobody was there to reign in the visual excesses.

I think the first cycle of Hollow Crown was done better. I think it was also unfortunate that rather than assign plays to individual directors as they did in the first cycle, the entire production here is done with one director (Dominic Cooke). The acting in Richard III deserves a high degree of praise, but its not enough to save the work as a whole.",1475193600,9,4387,4.445273631840796

The acting here is uniformly stunning, the directing sharp and incisive, the pace resembling some relentless machine of destiny (and retribution), the settings varied and realistic. I am sure most viewers will agreee Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the great Richard III performers; his interpretation is his own and doesn't compete with Olivier's v-e-r-y different approach. Sophie Okonedo plays the wronged Queen with fierce energy,
making us both loathe and sympathize with her (quite a balancing act).

7719730,5,B01DLVAHQG,"Just wonderful stuff with Cumberbatch's Richard ( the future and then Richard III) down as one of the filmed greats.
Along with the previous filing of the ""Henriad"" ( the four plays - Richard II - Henry V) these BBC productions are a major contribution to the available filmed Chronicle local of the Fall of the Plantagenets and the Rise of the Tudors.
It has always be a struggle to deal with the so called War of the Roses cycle (the three Henry VI plays and Richard III). As far as I know only one effort has been made to film all of the four plays without cuts and abridgements and these complete Shakespeare series were fine. However, it is traditional to cut the Henry VI plays as was done in the still classic An Age of Kings from the 1960s; and several attempts at the War of the Roses.
The Hollow Crown moves into contention as one of the best acted across the board and it is certainly the best filmed effort. It tells the tale as an historical period costume and brings tension and drama to what are familiar plays to many.",1471478400,2,1034,4.335051546391752
7719731,5,B01DLVAHQG,"Absolutely incredible.  The acting was top rate and, unlike the first Hollow Crown series, BBC clearly had a bigger budget for this one.  Benedict Cumberbatch's ""Now is the winter of our discontent"" soliloquy was the best rendition I've ever seen of the Richard III opening.  Sophie Okonedo pulled off Queen Margaret superbly and was convincing both as a young ruthless Margaret and as an old bitter Margaret.  My only disappointment was that they cut the Henry VI plays to make it fit into two parts instead of three.  The primary cut was of the Jack Cade rebellion - I really wanted to see the mob scene with the famous ""The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers"" line.",1471478400,,679,4.625
7719732,4,B01DLVAHQG,"I enjoyed ""The Wars of the Roses, The Hollow Crown"" very much.  The directing, the actors, the sets, the costumes, were all superb!  Cumberbatch was delightfully malignant and very convincing, capturing the real spirit, I feel, of the determinedly, perverse evil of Richard.

But, is everybody going to hate my guts for saying, candidly, that although Sophie Okonedo was a truly superb actress, and although she gave an excellent performance, this really wan't a production that should have had any Black people in the cast.  To my knowledge, the only Black person ever mentioned in one of Shakespeare's plays was Othello -- maybe!  Even there, that character is described as ""The Moor"".  A black person in this role was a definite distraction, because it was so, well, unavoidable, and always ""called attention to itself"".  So, to this degree, I fault the casting.  Remember how everyone laughed at the idea of John Wayne playing Genghis Khan?  Or, what if Arnold Schwarzenegger decided to play the starring role in a movie about Muhammad Ali?  See what I mean?",1471305600,3,1062,4.982954545454546

7719740,3,B01DLVAHQG,"Shakespeare as Game of Thrones. There are some riveting performances, Cumberbatch as Ric III, Okendo as Queen Margaret, Ben Miles as Somerset and the production is entertaining, colorful and fast-paced. No one is going to care about the vast textual cuts, the deleted scenes, the amalgamated or lost characters and some odd transpositions and inauthentic re-writes; many inevitable in a film-time version. What matters, does it work on its own terms? Only so-so, I'd say. Shakespeare was writing for a very small pre-Globe stage (at least for the Henry VI plays) so that his dramatic means has to be a highly wrought verbal rhetoric; ""translating"" this language to a full bloodied (and how!) realistic-naturalistic (half-battle) film just doesn't really fit. I found myself falling in a great skeptical gap between rhetoric and action; at many levels this production is simply not believable and a forced fit. Compared to what? Well to Hollow Crown One but especially to the older BBC complete plays series and to the even older but superb black and white TV era ""The Age of Kings."" This series is a must for Shakespeare fans but many may come away from it with a kind of sighing ""oh, well"" disappointment, sound acting and much furor signifying -- not as much as it so earnestly intends.",1469923200,3,1288,4.940092165898617

7719756,5,B01DLVAHQG,"I'm keeping this brief. The history of the Wars of the Roses isn't easy to follow. Kings are disposed as other ambitious men and their equally ambitious wives vie for power. Main complaints? If we're to believe Margaret is a member of France's royal family, could her father and brother at least be the same color/of a darker tone. Sophie Okonedo is great in the part, but are Dad is whiter than white and makes it a tad hard to believe she's is daughter-and hence makes her less believable And the original Hollow Crown series the French were portrayed by French actors, complete needless to say with French accents. Not so this time around. Joan of Arc sounds like she came from northern England, Margaret from London and the Dauphin from heaven knows where, but certainly not from any region in France. Feel that's a tad needless-plenty of well qualified French actors who could have filled these parts. But Richard...! Oh my-Benedict Cumberbatch portrays him brilliantly-subtle at the right moment, raging lunatic in others-he is utterly believable as a frightening psychopath-this would've been an Oscar worthy performance-he is that good. Very well worth watching. I hope more of Shakespeare's history plays are done in this manner-it brings the Bard to life again and reminds us why is work is still being performed 400 years after he died-his language and poetry are still a thing of beauty",1468281600,24,1398,4.927966101694915

7719758,5,B01DLVAHQG,"I am a bit confused by some of the reviews...one claimed there was only two disc but I got three disc's.  Some reviews complained of picture quality, while both picture & sound quality on my disc's are great!  When translating Shakespeare to film you are bound to loose dialogue as "" Willy"" was the most prolific user of words of any author from his peer's to date.  Even to the point of making up his own words.  But this second installment into William Shakespeare's British Historical plays is top notch satisfying both the History buffs as well as Shakespeare fans.  I have not seen such a gripping performance of the vile Richard the 3rd since Laurence Olivier's 1955 performance!  As with any story the more you know about the times or the human condition such as king Richards spinal deformity the more meaning the dialogue takes on.  Like in Romeo & Juliet it was not until I was studying sword fighting that I came to fully appreciate "" Tibalt: The prince of Cats"" when I learned that there is a strike you can perform with the thin bladed Rapier called a ""scratch"".  This is where you swing the blade with great force stopping quickly which makes the blade whip around in a dramatic arc.  This is how Tibalt was able to stab Marcucio  with Romeo standing between the two combatants.  The same goes' for the crippled king Richard who's armor would have helped support him although  his condition would have made him tire more quickly than a healthy soldier, but on horseback he would have been more equal if not peerless realizing the advantage of being mounted he most certainly would have dedicated more training to combat from the saddle.  Knowing this makes his pleads of "" My Kingdom for a horse!!"" have much more importance & impact.  Some may consider this second installment of the hollow crown series to violent & graphic but this is the reality of what these medieval weapons did to the human body & war should never be minimized...just be glad we don't have smellovision T.V.'s!!!  Being both a huge fan of history & Shakespeare I believe this series is a superb compromise giving us the best of both aspects.  This series covers some of the most historically important battles from "" The Hundred years Wars""  The incredible battle of Agincourt which some claim marked the "" End of chivalry"" but ushered in the concept of "" Brothers in Arms"" & the civil battles & court intrigue of "" The War of the Roses.""  The battle of "" Tewksbury"" where the ""Bastard Sword"" may have been at the height of its popularity.  The costumes & props are beautiful as well as the cinematography & acting, this series has the look & feel of a Big screen production & while I don't rate movies on their budget but rather there ability to entertain when handling Shakespeare the bar is always set high & I feel this whole series delivers!!!  After watching "" The Hollow Crown"" your expectations for "" The Hollow Crown : War of the Roses"" may be raised...but I think you will find it meets those expectations.  Of course my expectations were never very high knowing this was done on a limited budget.  I guess it just goes to show money doesn't equate to a great film, I think what made this series great came from the heart!",1467763200,37,3220,4.573170731707317
7719759,3,B01DLVAHQG,"I love the Henry VI / Richard III plays. They are certainly not Shakespeare's greatest plays, but they are great melodramatic fun. That probably explains my disappointment with this production. The acting is uniformly excellent, but most of the melodrama and most of the fun are gone, along with some 2/3 of the text. In their place we get realism, of course. The producers do everything they can to make us forget that these were originally written as plays. Gone are the asides. Gone are all the classical references that give color to the speeches. Most of the soliloquies are gone. When Margaret captures the Duke of York we get the bare minimum of their horrific exchange. The producers replace the emotional brutality of ""Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance!"" with the physical brutality of changing his mock crown from paper to thorny twigs. Their agenda is clearly to elicit emotional responses from visual gore, and nothing from the poetry. Shakespeare is an obstacle to them, but in fairness, the DVD box cover does not mention Shakespeare. That should have been my warning.",1467504000,22,1097,4.871657754010696

7719761,2,B01DLVAHQG,"The Wars of Roses contains three discs with the adaptations of four History Plays, i.e., Henry VI (Part 1, 2, and 3) and Richard III. This production is a sequel to the BBC previous series The Hollow Crown. Lets recall that Shakespeare used the History Plays to illustrate England as a being who goes through seven stages of transformation towards the development of true kinghood. Each stage is associated with one of the seven kings, i.e., King John, Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI, Richard III, and Henry VIII. The Wars of Roses and The Hollow Crown, therefore, contain nearly the entire transformation cycle illustrated in the History Plays, except for the first (King John) and the last (Henry VIII) episodes.

Shakespeares plays have been designed in such a way as to have a specific impact on the human mind. Shakespeare alluded to the function of his plays in Hamlets stage instructions to the players. He divided his audience into two groups, i.e., the unskillful and the judicious. In Shakespeares language, the unskillful refers to the ordinary mind which is driven by ordinary intellectual and emotional reflexes. The judicious indicates specific latent faculties of a persons mind. Man may reach a higher state of humanity, or true kinghood, through the activation of these particular faculties. In other words, the playwrights aim was to stimulate and activate these more subtle layers of the mind that form the basis for transformation of man into a truly human being. (Harold Bloom referred to Shakespeares canon as The Invention of the Human; it seems, however, that Shakespeare rather provided a recipe for how a man may become truly human).

By compiling four plays into 6 hours of filming time, the director of The Wars of Roses faced quite a challenge. Namely, which scenes were to be cut-off and which were to be modified? It was these decisions that would determine the outcome of his undertaking. Any modifications of the plays are risky but not because Shakespeares canon is supposed to be treated as sacrosanct. Randomly cutting-off scenes or modifying the plots destroys the plays intended impact on the audience. The plays should remain sacrosanct as long as their impact is not fully grasped. However, when their function is well understood, the plays cease to be sacrosanct, because then they may be modified in such a way that their intended impact is preserved. Therefore, Shakespeares adaptations may be evaluated by their effectiveness in preserving the original function of the plays.

The History Plays illustrate the various challenges and difficulties associated with the gradual activation of the latent faculties of the mind. Henry VI, Part 1 is particularly interesting for it describes the first signs of the manifestation of these faculties. In this play, the overall inner state of England is manifested by a mix of reactions driven by greed, jealousy, fear, revenge, desires, treachery, fickle loyalties, and a whole spectrum of crude attachments. It may seem that the outcome is determined by chance and accidental events. It may seem like that - till one notices that the overall flow of events is subtly but nevertheless effectively modulated by the gradual development of these above-mentioned faculties. As in all Shakespeares plays, the overriding template is discreetly marked by a series of rather odd episodes. This is why it may be easily overlooked. In The Wars of the Roses, the working of such a template is marked by the appearance of the character of Joan La Pucelle in Henry VI, Part 1. It is important to notice that her appearance is a result of Prince Harrys personal efforts described in the previous episodes of the History Plays, i.e., in Henry IV and Henry V(with Henrys death the English circle ends ... ; now am I like that proud insulting ship). Joan symbolically represents a subtle faculty that is capable of breaking through the limitations of time and space. This is why she refers symbolically to her origin as issued from the progeny of kings. It is this faculty that allows foreseeing and even influencing certain future events. In her first appearance, Joan describes how a vision appeared to her (I.2). This figure showed itself in all its glory; the divine rays brought her beauty. Joan realizes that she was given an extraordinary power that she can exercise. In order to function effectively, however, this particular faculty requires a specific environment with a certain degree of balance and harmony. Otherwise, its premature or untimely activation could be disturbing and may lead to its corruption and withdrawal. And this is the case of Joan. The unbalanced and disharmonious state of England which is driven by very basic and crude reactions does not allow Joan to discharge her constructive function. This is shown in a later episode in which Joan encounters her invisible agents (V.3). Previously, Joan described them as carriers of glorious rays. Now, because of her corrupted state, she sees them as fiends. The demons refuse to help her. Joan cannot survive without the support of these invisible agents. This particular faculty is deactivated.

It is very difficult, or even impossible, to understand the play without being familiar with the methodology of the developmental process. Joan alludes to it in her comment: you judge it straight a thing impossible to compass wonders but by help of devils. The next sign of manifestation of this subtle faculty is marked in the episode with the raising of a spirit by a wizard named Bolingbrook (Henry VI, Part 2, I.4). At that time, the overall state of England is still far away from being balanced or harmonious. This is why the subtle faculty, symbolically represented by a spirit, is only partially operational. The spirit is capable of delivering quite a precise prediction of the fate of King Henry, the Duke of York, the Duke of Suffolk, and the Duke of Somerset. It is incapable, however, of warning Bolingbrook and his assistants against an imminent danger that they are faced with at this very moment. As indicated later on by Clarences dream (Richard III, I.4), the limitations imposed by crude attachments did not allow this spirit to soar to a more lofty state (the envious flood kept in my soul, and would not let it forth to seek the empty, vast and wandering air). In other words, this faculty is still not developed enough to influence the overall situation according to its potential. Shakespeare contrasted Bolingbrooks episode with a fake miracle at St. Alban (Henry VI, Part 2, II.1). In this way he emphasized the difference between an imperfect but a genuine manifestation of an extraordinary perception and the staging of a fake miracle by a wicked person in order to abuse the ignorant.

The removal of Joan creates a void that encourages the most mischievous aspects of England to exercise their villainy with even greater intensity. At the same time, these wicked aspects start to serve as a magnet for other destructive and corrupted members. They all agglomerate around their leaders and, in this way, are gradually sorted out from others. This provides room for brief flashes of realization of what the nature of the true kinghood is. While wandering in the wilderness, King Henry alludes to it in his comment: My crown is in my heart, not on my head. In the next phase of this cleansing operation, the destructive aspects cannot help but turn against their own weaker members. When they are weakened by this self-induced destruction, they can be diminished more effectively. It is then that the remaining members get support through the re-appearance of invisible agents. The invisible agents are symbolically illustrated by the eleven Ghosts in the final act of Richard III (V.3). It is only at this point that these invisible agents are capable of influencing the overall situation in a constructive way. This scene with the Ghosts providing their support to Richmond is a confirmation of Joans previous comment about the nature of the invisible forces. The most wicked and corrupted aspects of England are eliminated. England is cleansed and ready to enter onto the next stage of the process. This next stage is presented in Henry VIII, i.e., the final play of the History Plays. In other words, the events presented in The Wars of Roses are an illustration of a cleansing operation. The entire process is executed through a sequence of seemingly odd episodes that include (i) the appearance of Joan, (ii) Joans encounter with the fiends, (iii) the raising of a spirit by Bolingbrook, and (iv) the intervention of the Ghosts. It is this sequence that has to be preserved and correlated with all other events -if the originally intended impact of the plays is to be preserved. So, lets take a look at how the BBC production dealt with this template.

Making the Duke of Somerset instead of the Earl of Suffolk a lover of Queen Margaret does not affect the inner template of the plays. Neither removing the subplot with Cades rebellion affects the overall sequence. However, reducing the character of Joan into a delusional psychopath seriously corrupts Shakespeares narrative. Joans lines in which she describes the circumstances of her transformation are cut-off. The scene where she encounters the fiends is also removed. So is the episode with Bolingbrook. Instead, the scenes with the raising of the spirit and the fake miracle at St. Alban are substituted by an invented episode where the Duchess of Gloucester attempts to perform a sort of voodoo ritual by piercing a doll with a pin. The scene with the Ghosts delivering their support to Richmond is deleted. In other words, the entire inner fabric of the plays is removed. Shakespeares History Plays are reduced to a sort of Game of Thrones, i.e., a sterile entertainment without developmental content. The unskillful takes over the judicious. But lets leave it up to the audiences to decide whether sexed-up scenes, graphic horror, screams of tortured prisoners, plenty of severed and bloody body parts - are enough to compensate for the lost opportunity to exercise the judicious layers of their minds.",1467244800,19,10146,5.014827995255041

7719769,5,B01DLVAHQG,"The second set of Shakespeares history plays produced by the BBC follows-on chronologically from the Henriad concluding with Tom Hiddleston's magnificent performance as Henry V.

Here we have three films rather than the four of the first series. The tag-line to this second series is The Wars of the Roses as the films chronicle the conflict between the houses of Lancaster and York as they fought for the English crown between 1455 and 1485, culminating with the death of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth, the end of the Yorkist dynasty and the dawn of the Tudor Age.

Here Shakespeares three parts of Henry VI are pruned down into two films called Part 1 and Part 2. These are not identical to the plays so titled, but are basically parts 2 & 3 with an abbreviated part 1 (about the loss of territories in France won by Henry V) slotted into the first film. The difficult role of the weak, vacillating and unworldly Henry VI is here played to perfection by Tom Sturridge, who like Ben Wishaws excellent performance as Richard II in the first series makes the character of the young King both pitiable and sympathetic, whilst here Sturridges Henry VI is revealed as a fish out of water, completely unsuitable for kingship in the violent and bloody Middle Ages. His adulterous French-born queen Margaret is played superbly by Sophie Okonedo (with no trace of a French accent!), who brings strength of character, ruthlessness and vindictiveness to the role of this warrior-queen.

Caution: some of the battle scenes portrayed in these plays are realistic to the point of being R-rated, as heads and limbs are severed and rivers of blood flow. The filmmakers decision to pull no punches when portraying these scenes can be questioned: while they hold the attention and convey the brutality of the time they are not for the squeamish or easily traumatised. Swords and axes cut into flesh and bone, severed heads are hoisted on pikes, people squirm as they are hanged from trees in the open and Joan of Arc screams as she is burned at the stake. You have been warned!

In the concluding film of the series Benedict Cumberbatch turns in an outstanding performance as Richard III, complete with scenes of his scoliosis skeletal deformity created by a convincing prosthesis. The running time of this play  one of Shakespeares greatest - has been halved and the necessary editing may not be to the taste of the purist, as many witty asides in the original text from Richard to the audience have been excised to serve the needs of brevity. But Cumberbatchs performance as Shakespeares malignant usurper-king is nevertheless seriously impressive, conveying all the malevolence, intelligence and ruthlessness with few redeeming features.

As with the first series, the production is lavish. Fabulous costumes and sympathetic use of contemporary interiors (many in surviving buildings from the Middle Ages) are juxtaposed with epic landscapes in England and France, offering a rich theatrical experience which at the same time is magnificently cinematic.

This first class drama is a triumph for the BBC production team and has raised the bar for all future performances of these difficult plays on stage and screen. Unconditionally recommended.",1465776000,163,3238,5.007434944237918
8756400,2,B01DLVAHQG,"Disappointing interpretation of Richard III by Cumberbatch. Decent production quality and anatomically accurate body makeup of kyphoscoliotic hunch, but overall adds nothing to existing versions of the play(s).",1537920000,,210,6.535714285714286
8756401,5,B01DLVAHQG,"Incredible performance by a host of very talented actors. The story of the fall of the Plantagenets, ending with the defeat of Richard III, is richly told. The costumes and scenery truly do Shakespeare justice.",1536019200,,210,5.0285714285714285

8756406,5,B01DLVAHQG,"Awesome! I usually loathe and hate the BBC--and I still do--but they pulled off a coup with this series. Great acting, great camera work, pretty true to the plays as written. If you're just now diving into Shakespeare, this is a good place to start as watching it a few times will help you learn this particular dialect of English, which makes actually reading Shakespeare a lot easier.",1529971200,,386,4.6911764705882355
8756407,5,B01DLVAHQG,"Buy the whole series!  A wonderful set of plays but Richard III is fabulous. Whether its Benedict Cumberbatch being loathsome or Sophie Okonedo being the scene stealing she-wolf of France, these are riveting presentations.",1527292800,,222,5.529411764705882
8756408,5,B01DLVAHQG,"Excellent adaptions of the three Shakespeare plays!!  The three parts of Henry VI are done in two, and Richard III is the third part.  There is a fine 30-minute featurette on the three films, along with a few deleted scenes.  The cast and their acting is incredible.  Five stars.",1525824000,,279,4.63265306122449
