8344088,3,B001UK5BKI,"This movie certainly has not been licensed for Region 1 viewing yet. Currently, its only on DVD in Japan and the UK. How do we have a Region 1 copy on Amazon.com? I don't fault people for trying to bring good movies to the US early, but buyer beware, its probably not the real thing.",1244678400,3,283,4.163636363636364
8344089,5,B001UK5BKI,"I really enjoyed this film -- part mystery, part adventure, part quest. It's a cautionary morality tale that's up there with the best of them!

Performances -- especially from the child actors -- were uniformly first-rate, and the resemblance between those youngsters and the actors playing their adult selves was uncanny.

Production values were also quite high -- this was not a low-budget effort!

I'm really looking forward to the sequel!",1236124800,3,442,5.197183098591549
