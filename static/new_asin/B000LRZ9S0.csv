8163902,5,B000LRZ9S0,"We all know that puppies are cute, and kids are cute...but put them together and the cute factor is just off the charts!  That's exactly what you get in this combination DVD & CD set.  Now let me just say that the creator, Mark Hafley is a genius. Why?  Simple...while the main portion of the DVD is only 23 minutes long, you have the option of putting it on loop so that it will play over and over again. That's just what I did the first time I showed it to my four year-old.  I think he was about on his fourth or fifth viewing by the time he emerged from his room. When asked if he liked the movie, he replied with a resounding ""Yeah!""

In Puppytown, several young children and dozens of adorable puppies are gathered in a picturesque park for a day of play.  Sprightly songs play throughout the this fun and educational video.  The catchy numbers include songs about playing, chasing, the parts of a puppy, what a puppy wants to be when it grows up, as well as the hilarious tune about puppies going to the bathroom which had my wife and I laughing out loud, not too mention our son.

There are a myriad of puppies in the video in all shapes, sizes, and colors, from St. Bernards to Malteses, and Basset Hounds to Bull Dogs, all running, chasing, chewing, playing tug-of-war, and riding in wagons to the delight of the half a dozen or so children.  But I mentioned educational and Puppytown certainly is that.  First there's the song about puppy parts such as every puppy has four paws, two years, two eyes, one tail, etc...Then there is the song about what puppies should eat and drink and how sleeping will make them grow big and strong.  And don't forget the very important puppy rules such as ""never hurt a puppy"", ""Never scare a puppy"" and ""never pet a puppy you don't know.""  Wise and important rules, indeed!

Once the video is over your kids can take the Puppytown quiz to see just how much they've learned by watching the video.  Get all of the answers correct, and your kid becomes a Puppytown Wrangler!  Reward him with one of the Puppytown sticker badges that come with the DVD and now they can watch the secret Puppytown Wrangler song.

The accompanying CD has all of the wonderful songs on it so the kids can listen to it in the car.  This is a real treat for kids and parents alike!

8163903,5,B000LRZ9S0,"Where on earth can one find big dogs and little dogs, fluffy dogs and droopy dogs, puppy dogs and momma dogs, dogs in hats and pants and sunglasses, and playful dogs and lazy dogs alike?  In PUPPYTOWN, of course!

PUPPYTOWN: THE MOVIE is an interactive DVD for kiddoes aged two to six, designed to school young ones in puppy fundamentals.  This is no THE DOG WHISPERER, however; playing to his audience, creator Mark Hafley keeps it light and simple, with short segments such as ""Puppy Playtime,"" ""Puppy 101,"" ""Chowtime,"" ""Puppy Rules,"" and ""Growing Up.""  PUPPYTOWN is mainly inhabited by human children and their puppy counterparts, with an occasional guest appearance by a canine parent.  Thus, the kids are able to narrate the show, dispensing helpful puppy care advice along the way.  The ""how-to"" segments are interspersed with fun, catchy little ditties about doggy dos and don'ts (which are also featured on the supplemental CD, perfect for puppy fun on the go).

Naturally, PUPPYTOWN wouldn't be complete without oodles and oodles of cute, fuzzy-wuzzy puppies.  The pups in PUPPYTOWN don't disappoint!  Throughout the 35-minute show, viewers are treated to gratuitous footage of Akitas, American Bulldogs, Bandogs, Basset Hounds, Beagles, Bernese Mountain Dogs, English Springer Spaniels, Fortes Malteses, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Siberian Huskies, and St. Bernards, frolicking in lush green grass, playing tug-o-war, spilling out of Radio Flyer wagons, and strutting their stuff in all sorts of silly costumes. Cute hardly begins to describe these furkids.

And your canine companions are sure to love PUPPYTOWN too, what with all the yipping and yapping that can even be set to play on a continuous loop. My pack of five left PUPPYTOWN riled up and ready to play.

A word of warning to parents: if you have no intentions of adopting a dog for your little ones anytime soon, you probably don't want to tempt them with PUPPYTOWN.  On the other hand, if you plan on welcoming a furry friend into your home, PUPPYTOWN is a great tool to educate your kids about basic puppy care before the big day arrives.  In addition to the main feature, the Interactive Puppy can help teach children about puppy anatomy.  There's also Puppy Quiz to help parents challenge and motivate their potential ""puppy wranglers.""  Above all else, parents can use PUPPYTOWN as a jumping-off point for teaching their young ones about responsible companion animal guardianship for life.",1173744000,2,2480,5.149625935162095
8163904,5,B000LRZ9S0,"The Maltese puppies in Puppy Town are especially cute and kids will love watching all the puppies run about in their ""I'm so happy to be alive on this planet"" exuberance. Bulldogs, English Springer Spaniels, Golden Retrievers, Maltese and St. Bernards all make their appearance.

The setting is in a park where the puppies play on the grass, chasing tennis balls or taking naps. Sometimes they are found with goggles in a director's chair, but mostly they run about eating, drinking water and sometimes chewing on the ""Beware of the Dog"" sign, which is funny.

Children will love this cleverly designed educational video and learn quite a bit about raising a puppy without even realizing they are taking a ""how to look after a puppy"" class. The kids in the video are the teachers and they are also featured in the interactive quiz section. You can choose to view the video once (24 minutes), or loop the video for extended viewing sessions.

As puppies run about hiding under wagons or being taken on wagon rides, the songs tell the story of what you are viewing. Songs like ""Run little Puppy,"" ""Sleepy Puppy,"" I Wanna Grow Up,"" and ""Big Puppy Little Puppy"" are fun and creative. A CD is also included as a bonus so kids can listen to the songs in the car or while doing art projects.

The catchy lyrics will delight young children and teach them to put words with what they are viewing. When children pass the quiz, they can then wear the Certified PuppyTown Wrangler sticker.

Future episodes will also include educational material on a wide variety of topics from how to take care of other pets like hamsters and cats to videos about dogs that work alongside people or acrobatic dogs that perform tricks.

Yes, this has the ""So cute, I want a puppy too"" factor. Parents may enjoy watching this with their children and the interactive quiz may require some assistance. If you are planning to adopt a puppy, this would make a perfect gift because it teaches children how to look after a new puppy.
