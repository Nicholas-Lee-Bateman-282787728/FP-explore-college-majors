Unfortunately, she got bored of it after the second episode because Hello Kitty wasn't even in the others. However, she does love the ""Alice in Wonderland"" episode, which is why I bought this one in the first place.

I love that it cycles through the episodes without going to the disc menu.",1459814400,,374,4.666666666666667

This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

REVIEW OF THIS 1993 ANIME CARTOON EPISODE...
I guess there are two kinds of people in the world; Those that know of Hello Kitty, and those that don't. I was in the latter category until I started searching for all versions of Alice in Wonderland in the known universe, and what popped up on the radar but Hello Kitty, which at first appeared to be a silly children's show done as anime. They had done an episode on the Alice story. I cataloged the episode and obtained a copy, but didn't view the cartoon until I worked my to it viewing the Alice productions in chronological order.

Even at that, I initially had no intention of posting a review of what must be a silly take off on Alice in Wonderland, along with other silly kids show renderings of the story such as The Care Bears, Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse, Barney, Scooby Doo, and even the more adult show, The Simpsons.

But I just now saw the Hello Kitty episode. Wow! Loved it. Apparently the various Hello Kitty installments have a penchant for doing takeoffs on fairy tales, and had decided it was now time that ""Hello Kitty does Alice in Wonderland"". The show is not only funny, it actually followed the storyline pretty well. For example they did the passage from the book where Alice eats a piece of the caterpillars mushroom and grows her neck so tall that a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent bent on robbing her nest of its eggs. This sequence is almost a litmus test for an Alice production as most all of them fail to enact this scene. Well done Hello Kitty! No Gryphon / Mock Turtle scene though. :<

I particularly enjoyed the voice of the actress who plays a slightly dim, slightly naive Alice. Wait. She's NOT Alice. She's Kitty White! Anyway, the actress voicing her is Melissa Fahn, who was 20 when they created this anime. Melissa's comic timing is superb, and it doubled the laughs coming from the jokey way they wrote this interpretation of Alice in Wonderland. Finally, it should not escape attention that the name of Alice's cat in the Looking Glass is ""Kitty"", and in fact Alice Liddell's cat in real life, Dinah, had a kitten named Kitty.

8024661,3,B00029NMJK,"This disc features two stories starring Hello Kitty (""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Heidi""), one story featuring Pekkle (""Aladdin and His Magic Lamp""), and one story featuring Keroppi (""The Adventrures of Gulliver"").

In ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Hello Kitty stars as the main character.  Overall, this was rather faithful to the main story.  In ""Heidi,"" Hello Kitty once again plays the lead character.  In both stories, Hello Kitty is the only one of the regular Sanrio characters to appear in them.  Everyone else who appears in the stories are made up specifically for these episodes.

Pekkle stars as Aladdin in ""Aladdin and His Magic Lamp,"" and Keroppi stars as Gulliver in ""The Adventures of Gulliver.""  Again, Pekkle and Keroppi are the only actual Sanrio characters that appear in the stories.  The Hello Kitty version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was rather similar to well-known Disney version, but the Pekkle version of ""Aladdin"" was very different from the Disney telling of the same story.

When it comes to the stories on this DVD, I think that the cute style of the animation and the music do make these stories more accessible to the young audience that this DVD is aiming for.

Admittedly, this DVD is rather ""low frills"" when it comes to extras.  The only ""special feature"" is the DVD credits.  Normally, I would count the lack of special features against a DVD.  However, since this disc is being aimed at and marketed to young children, having special features on this DVD isn't quite as important.  Since younger children have shorter attention spans, they're less likely to sit still for special features.

This Hello Kitty DVD includes anime that's very friendly to young children, although girls will probably be more interested than boys.  If you have a young child at home and are looking for kid-friendly anime, then I would recommend the Hello Kitty & Friends DVDs.",1225756800,5,1883,4.968051118210862
