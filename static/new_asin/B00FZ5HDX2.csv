8619694,3,B00FZ5HDX2,"I have both volumes of Art of the Sash, and the material itself is well presented.  Mr. Fazio is very skilled with the techniques and does a good job of presenting and explaining the material.  However, the DVD really needs to have a menu so that you can jump to the chapters and even in to the specific principles and/or techniques that are being presented.  I have the same issue with Volume 1, but it was even more problematic with this volume.",1434672000,,447,4.426829268292683
8619695,5,B00FZ5HDX2,"PHENOMENAL Breakdown of the fundamentals of the sash. Before purchasing this DVD I had a background in training with the rope dart, meteor hammer, and the nine section chain whip. Many of these principles carry over into Mr. Fazio's system. Mr. Fazio is a phenomenal instructor and an absolute blast to watch. I suggest both of these videos to people that are just beginning with hinged or soft weapons, as well as experienced students. I was very, very pleased with this product, Mr. Fazio did a great job.",1434326400,2,507,4.7727272727272725
