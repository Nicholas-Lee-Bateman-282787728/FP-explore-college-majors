8198819,5,B00007FPKU,"Absolutely the best Muay Thai video I have seen. Sound and image are very good. Mr. Janjira makes you feel like being there at the gym. His focus into the mechanics of kicking, are better than those of several real life instructors I have had. If you want an expert's demonstration of how to kick to the head, abdomen, legs, and how to use your elbows, do yourself a favor. Buy this tape.",1063065600,2,388,4.328767123287672
