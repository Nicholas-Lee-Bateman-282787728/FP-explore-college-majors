2332877,5,B0009X77IQ,"This workout is great! It gets you tired-- not only from cardio .. but strengthwise. The movements are fun and not too repetitive-- and the music is actually pretty good for a workout dvd :-) I wouldn't recommend this for beginners that need lots of motivation-- but if you've been working out for awhile, have worked out before, or are a beginner that enjoys a challenge... this would be a great addition :-)",1130889600,12,409,4.616438356164384
2332878,5,B0009X77IQ,"This workout is part of the Firm's 4th Body Sculpting System, which introduces the ""Transfirmer"" a 5 in 1 piece of equipment used in a variety of ways.  It is similar to the Fanny Lifter but longer in length, as there is a 6 inch and an 8 inch portion used for aerobics, you can stack them on top of each other for a 14 inch platform used for leg presses, in an incline position for a little added challenge for aerobics, or in a side by side position to be used for lunges and dips and also aerobics.  It is a very versatile piece of equipment and it is very stable.

This workout is 39 minutes long and is led by Pam Cauthen Meriwether, who led the Firm Strength workout 10 years ago.  She is joined by 4 fellow Firm instructors, including Allison who shows beginner modifications.  The set is bright, similar to the setting in the BSS2 workouts (Complete Aerobics & Weight Training, Maximum Cardio Burn and Total Sculpt plus Abs).

You start with a simple aerobic warmup on the incline then proceed into lower body work alternating sets of squats and lunges.  The first set has varying tempos with halftime reps and a hold with pulsing reps.  Then you will move to the incline for lunges on the right leg, again with varying tempos, halftime reps and 4-4 count.  Then you will do more squats, this time with the option to lift the heel on one leg to make it more challenging, then you will repeat the lunge sequence on the left leg, before finishing out with one more set of squats, again with options to make it harder, such as heel/foot lifts.

Upper body is next, all the exercises consist of varying tempos and counts.  You will start with double arm bent rows while standing on incline, then you will move into upright rows, then another set of bent over rows this time with the palms up and down, lighter weights are more appropriate here.  Then you will lie on the incline for some ribcage pullovers, pec flies and bench press.

Tough ab work is next, you will do traditional planks with alternating leg lifts, then side planks with hip lifts.  Then you will kneel and do oblique work using a dumbell, first leaning side to side while holding the dumbell over your head, then twisting side to side while holding the dumbell in front of you.  Much harder than it looks.

More lower body work is next, first with dips using the Transfirmer in the side by side position where you place the 6 inch segment directly in front of you, then place the 8 inch segment behind it, sort of like a staircase.  You will stand on the 6 inch portion and dip off the back, then when coming back up you will tap your foot on the 8 inch portion in front of you, you will do 12 halftime reps then 4 4-count reps, before going right into the other leg.  Leg presses follow, where you put the Transfirmer in the 14 inch position.  You start on top and do 8 reps on each side, then 4 reps each side, then 2 reps each side which really elevates the heartrate.  You will then finish out this segment with tall box climbs.

More upper body work follows, starting with clean and presses then into overhead presses, then bicep curls.  Next are tricep kickback, then more biceps with hammer curls with side deltoid raises, lighter weights are appropriate here.  Then you will grab your lightest weights for more original tricep and deltoid work.  You will do rear deltoid rows right into tricep kickbacks with palms facing to the back, after those you will move right into frontal deltoid raises.  Tricep dips follow, then a brief ab session before the cooldown and stretch.

This is a great workout, plus it's short, good for days you don't have a lot of time.  It has some innovative and interesting moves, but you will work.  I found that I had to use slightly lighter weights for some of the exercises as they are done in combination.  But it's a good workout for something different.  Definitely a keeper, and Pam as always does a great job.",1126396800,9,3926,4.442737430167598
2332879,5,B0009X77IQ,"This short but intense workout motivates you. The instructors are not annoying,it doesn't get boring and you'll be wondering where 35 minutes went. Great for any level. The firm has done it again!!!",1118880000,4,198,5.03030303030303
2332900,2,B0009X77IQ,"Do NOT recommend...This DVD is too short with not enough time for the true exercise portion.  If you have the original ""step"" equipment, they do not work for this dvd, meaning you would need to purchase the step equipment to follow the dvd.",1271635200,,240,4.5813953488372094
2332901,5,B0009X77IQ,"Like a previous reviewer, I liked this tape the best out of the Firm's TRANSFIRMER series. I don't really care for the additional aerobic training the other tapes offer. I already treadmill and do elliptical for an hour six days a week. What I do need however is strength training that can target my entire body and this tape does just that. You can really feel it while you are working it as well.
  While the tape may not be as strenous a workout as far as geting your heart rate up it DOES target all the major muscle groups in effective strength training exercises. The transfirmer box is used to help shape quadriceps and hamstrings as well as biceps, triceps and deltoids. The abdominal exercises demonstrated are challenging enough that they can produce effective results when done on a consistent basis over time.
  I would highly recommend this tape as an adjunct to running, walking, elliptical or other aerobic exercise. The loss of muscle mass is a real phenomenon for those of us over 50;  and, as it is explained on this tape, strength training will increase metabolism and thus slow the loss process. This cannot be overlooked.",1264464000,5,1142,4.71859296482412
2332902,4,B0009X77IQ,"Even though it is a bit short, this is a good work-out.  I really don't care for the ab work she does with the weights, but other than that I really like doing this video, especially if I am a little short on time and looking for a shorter work-out.  Even though it is short, she does great exercises and you can feel it in your muscles the next day.  Great workout!",1256774400,,366,4.055555555555555
2332903,4,B0009X77IQ,"I am coming back to working out with the Firm after many years off from it. The last time I used their DVDs on a regular basis was when BSS2 (2nd Fanny Lifter Series) was released on infomercial back in 2003?. I did this workout for the first time today and it really did give a good sweat factor with some nice compound lifting movements. There really isn't much cardio alone, it's more of an aerobic benefit from the compound movements. So for that reason, I have only given it 4 stars instead of 5 since the description says it includes some cardio. Now that I know about that, I can use this DVD for times when I want a quick lifting session only. I think there are more enjoyable ""lifting only"" DVDs from the Firm like Total Sculpt and Super Body Sculpt. However, for the length of the DVD, it is a great workout.

I also have knee issues and since I'm only in my mid-20s, I need to preserve them as much as possible. That is the reason why I stopped using the firm bc of the ""Signature"" Tall Box Climb and Leg Presses were just too hard on my knees causing extreme pain and swelling. Today I modified the movements by only climbing the 8 inch Step Segment instead of the full 14 inches. I know this will work with the Fanny Lifter as well. Granted it doesn't target in on those muscles like the full 14 inches does, but it really will help those of us with knee pain and injuries. I also have a Cathe Friedrich High Step which uses 2 inch risers and I have about 10 of those. So next time I will try it with 10 inches to see if I can't zone in on the butt and thighs a little better. Just a suggestion for those that are worried about problem joints. Enjoy!",1243900800,2,1663,4.1645962732919255
2332904,5,B0009X77IQ,"I always go back to this one--it is not too long (approx. 37 minutes), and it is just a good, solid workout.  It doesn't have a lot of ""fancy footwork"" so you don't have to learn it.  I really like the moves--not too many reps but just enough to really feel the burn. My sister-in-law likes this one also.  The other Firm videos using the Transfirmer are good, but some of them are an hour, so I don't always have time. I have been doing the Firm workouts since they came out, some 20+ years ago, and this one is one of my absolute favorites.",1241827200,,542,4.142857142857143
2332905,5,B0009X77IQ,This probably works if you use it!  :)  I have such good intentions,1240876800,,67,4.076923076923077
2332906,4,B0009X77IQ,"I tried this Firm DVD last week and found that it was easy to follow and the moves are not too complicated as with some other Firm DVDs. It is an excellent workout that is only about 30+ minutes long (short...). I love this workout session, the leg presses are tough and you will sweat while trying to do them.",1203984000,,310,4.183333333333334
2332907,5,B0009X77IQ,"I love this DVD, it goes by very quickly, gives a great all around workout and does not have too many fancy steps. Absolute beginners can do it with no weights and the lower step, then you can increase the weights and step gradually. This is a super little workout!",1193616000,,265,4.32
2332908,5,B0009X77IQ,"This is one of the three DVD's that came with the Transfirmer.  It's a quick, 34 minute strength training routine that works both the upper and lower body with the use of the Transfirmer and weights.  While it moves along quickly enough that I broke a sweat, it doesn't have cardio-only segments, so this is not one of the signature aerobic weight training workouts The Firm has been known for.

The number of transitions between use of the Transfirmer and different size weights isn't ridiculous, as was the case with some of the older Firm videos.  The routine was interesting without being difficult to follow and the workout just seemed to fly by.

While I found it a challenging workout, it wasn't to the point of extreme.  Intensity of the workout can be easily modified with the use of lighter or heavier weights.  The Instructor, Pam Cauthen, is pleasantly upbeat and encouraging, gives good cues and form suggestions.  I hadn't used the workout in a while, having moved to some other groups/brands for variety - but enjoyed it so much that I will put it back into regular rotation.",1185321600,3,1090,4.73015873015873
2332909,5,B0009X77IQ,"The FIRM Supercharged Sculpting workout is a highly stylized workout with electronica, artistically designed sets and a clean, sleek mood. This is a combination of traditional weight training with aerobics using the necessary TransFIRMer. Most of the exercises are recognizable as traditional exercises like plank or sit-ups and squats.

The lunges seem easier to do with the TransFIRMer, although weights are used throughout most of the exercises to give them a little more edge. The workout is followed by a brief stretching segment, but if you want to totally relax, there is a ""Bonus: 8-minute Stretch Workout.""

The TransFIRMer can be positioned in five different ways to increase the possibilities:

6"" TransFIRMer - The green section can be used alone

8"" TransFIRMer - The blue section can be used alone

14"" TransFIRMer - The blue and green sections used together

Side-by-Side TransFIRMer - The blue and green sections placed next to each other

Incline TransFIRMer - The green piece fits into the blue piece for a convenient and stable incline.

For years I couldn't do the FIRM workouts because I kept forgetting to buy the equipment, but now with the step at home I can try out most of the new workouts and have fun working out. The 2-piece step is also easy to arrange and is very sturdy. The low-impact exercises work well with the step.

2332931,4,B0009X77IQ,"I own quite a few Firm workouts; Pam Meriweather is one of the best instructors in the entire series.  The workout is only 35 minutes long and focuses solely on sculpting.  Although there are some minor cardio segments, in reality, your heartrate does not elevate on this workout.  That being said, it's a nice workout when you're not feeling ready to tackle 60 minutes, but want to feel like you are getting something for the effort.  It alternates between upper and lower body strength moves.  The dips are probably the most challenging as you segue from ""regular"" dips to curtsey dips and back to regular from one segment of the incline.",1171152000,2,640,4.72972972972973
2332932,2,B0009X77IQ,The soundtrack doesn't match the video.  It is slightly annoying but not unusable.  I think it may be a pirated copy because of this quirk.,1169769600,2,139,4.52
2332933,5,B0009X77IQ,"I LOVE this workout!! I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the best, most effective work out DVD that I've ever tried. I do this DVD three times a week, and have seen unbelievable results in just a short amount of time. My butt feels amazingly tight, and my whole body has slimmed down. The results were almost immediate. After just two workout, people started asking if I had lost weight. I have to say that I am bored and completely dissapointed with the other firm workouts, but Pam is fantastic and makes this work out super fun. Get this if you want to have a hot body- if really works! :)",1165708800,8,602,4.2894736842105265
2332934,5,B0009X77IQ,"I did the Firm workouts for years and always loved them. They were definitely the most effective workout (along with private Pilates) that I've ever done. It's true that working with weights is absolutely essential to a high metabolism and shapely muscles--especially as we get older. Don't think that you have to ""lose weight and THEN do strength training."" Proper strength training (if you're consistent) will help you lose weight!

That said, a few years back, I did start to stray from my Firm workouts for awhile. When I tried to get back into them a few years later, I found that I wasn't crazy about the newer DVD's that they put out, and some of my older ones, although still GREAT workouts, were a little too dated (talk about the high-cut white leotards and matching leg-warmers!!). AND I had done them all so many times already.

Then I saw the TRansFirmer advertised and thought I'd give it a try. It really is the best piece of equipment! It's light, easily changes from one position to another (unlike the last step/fanny lifter combination they made that was IMPOSSIBLE), and feels very stable and solid while you're working out with it. And the DVD's are great. The instructors are awesome, I never found myself getting annoyed, and I always work up a sweat. It really is the best of the Firm, but totally updated and fun. My favorite so far of the 4 that come with the Transfirmer is the Supercharged Sculpting with Pam. It's fairly short (unlike this review!), but very thorough and fun. Allie's great as well. I remember her as being one of the students in many of the old Firm workouts.

Anyway, I've never written a review before, but I felt compelled because I really have to applaud the Firm. They really nailed it this time. After doing it maybe 6 times, I can already feel (and see) my strength and muscle shape coming back. It's also helping me with my other workouts (Pilates and S-Factor) because of the strength I'm building. I look forward to new DVD's to go with the TransFirmer. I love it!!",1158969600,10,2022,4.626740947075209

Mainly, I like it becuase it's all strengthening activities and no cardio, which I do on alternate days but get kinda bored with.  But this one gets to the point, works all your important areas, and really makes you feel like you've done something, without using up an hour.

Fast forward to present, with a husband and child later, I decided I needed something to change up my routine-driving 30 minutes to the gym was becoming a hassle with a toddler in tow. I decided to immediately revisit the Firm workouts and I am so so glad I did. Even though I was a regular gym rat, I had hit a plateau and wasn't happy with my post-baby body. Since I started back with the Firm, I am now almost TEN lbs under my pre-pregnancy weight  and I can wear all my pre-pregnancy clothes (well, most of them bc some of them don't fit me anymore bc they're too big!) These workouts are effective, and can be as easy or as challenging as you choose to make them. I can't recommend these DVD's enough-I'm just a SAHM who wanted a workout that could be done during toddler naptime that would fetch results and this is IT. I would also recommend finding the Transfirmer bench-it's so versatile and can be used with all the previous body sculpting system workouts.
