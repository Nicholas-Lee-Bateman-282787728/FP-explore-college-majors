The DVD in question has an extensive selection of quite a mix of material;
broadway, traditional and even some Christmas stuff.  The songs are: I Love
You, London By Night, Younger Than Springtime, My Romance, Thanks A Million,
The Best Things In Life Are Free, Lucky To Be Me, At Christmastime, Hanover
Winter Song, Toyland, We Three Kings of Orient Are, Always, Easter Parade,
Now It Can Be Told, They Say That Falling In Love Is Wonderful, Rejoice,
Columbia's Sons, Rejoice!, Lorena, America The Beautiful, Battle Hymn Of The
Republic, Summertime, Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin' Evelina, All The Things
You Are, You'll Never Walk Alone, and Soliloquy.

They're from The Bell Telephone Hour telecasts from 1959-1966. Most of them
are in color, which is really nice (but why is the Soliliquy, from 1964, in
B&W?).

You look at these old TV shows and wonder.  The sets and production values
are inexpensive, with cardboardy looking props, and a kind of (what would be
perceived now) cornball approach.  Only people who grew up during then and
watched TV in that era, and retro enthusiasts, would have any appreciation -
and understanding - of these light entertainments.  TV was just different at
that time; no way could these kind of simple, pleasant pleasures be sold on
networks today.

And I doubt if any singers today (Hugh Jackman perhaps, based on his recent
song-and-dance show on Broadway) could pull off the utter sincerity and
simplicity with which many performers of that time displayed.

Raitt here is a perfect example of what I mean. Nothing he does is schticky,
self-conscious or over-the-top-coy (think Fleming).  Whatever the scenario,
whether doing seemingly packaged Christmas holiday cheer, donning ""frontier""
costumes for the traditional/patriotic/Americana stuff, lovey-dovey-enacted
duets (with one Martha Wright), or ""theme"" tableaus accompanying his songs -
he does it all with a straightforward, completely convincing, and sincere
manner.  It's not laughable; it's endearing.  There's no discomfort; he's at
ease, confident and masculine.

In fact, you take any song in this collection, and Raitt draws you in with
this sterling quality he embodies. It's a quality that, while not in any
capacity was taken for granted, people probably just assimilated
unconditionally and with non-judgmental, welcome acceptance.

There is not one instance where Raitt is not comfortable; and a kind of
guilelessness emanates from his being, not one false move or calculated
response to the mood or to the music. I could hold forth and say,
generalizing, where can you find that essence of untainted simplicity today;
but then you also have to remind yourself that that era also featured
horrors such as Robert Goulet - and countless others.

It's not just the era then; it's all Raitt. Good taste and instincts are
timeless, regardless of what period.  Class, charm and instincts,
faultlessly - and without even trying, or appearing to.

This is probably the largest number of live-performed videos of John Raitt
to exist, and how welcome they are.  Sadly, I don't think this release will
generate much sales or widespread interest, simply because Raitt didn't have
a major movie contract, and doesn't get repeated exposure the way Gordon
MacRae and Howard Keel do on TCM.  More's the pity, because Raitt had the
most outstanding tone, technique and musicianship; he's easily right up at
the top there in the pantheon of great singers. This DVD shows why. Every
baritone and tenor would do good to watch and listen.
Exceptional too, is Raitt's diction and pronunciation in every instance; any
song, any genre.  It lends his singing a bracing vitality.  Any dynamic
level, you want it, he gives it.  Effort? None.

It's all dispatched with a spontaneity as automatic as the act of breathing
itself, backed by his impeccable musicianship - and that spot-on tuning.
The tonal color is just gorgeous, and so resonant and ""forwardly"" placed;
you can hear the ease of the projection, the spinning out of the gold, as it
were.  Most welcome of all is his unfussy manner of singing words, meaning
he does not puff up the pronunciation in a way that Ethel Merman scathingly
termed ""Concert English."" You know what I mean; it's that icky-sicky fashion
of covering, vibrating the tone to give it ""meaning.""

The one drawback, though, of the performed songs themselves, through the
exigencies of broadcast time and all that, is that many of the songs are
abbreviated in some degree, lending a feeling of incompleteness and
possibly, of them being labeled by this approach as insubstantially casual.
 Adding to this feeling is that Raitt doesn't seem to be working very hard -
at all. It would appear, too, because everything is done today with such
self-consciously studied reverence, that Raitt merely showed up, tossed this
stuff off, and left. But pay attention. Raitt doesn't appear to be working
hard because he doesn't HAVE to; this kind of unforced , unfettered art is a
rare commodity - especially nowadays.  And I confess: I watched this at
first with more of a puzzled curiosity than enjoyment - it's kind of - on
the surface - a quaint relic of a bygone age, for which you have to adjust
from today's more fastidious sensibilities - not an easy thing to do.  But
then I put it on again a few hours later, listening to it without watching,
and Raitt's voice and delivery alone did the magical work on its own.

Essential to anyone who loves the art of singing and the singing voice.",1334275200,21,5568,4.976267529665588
