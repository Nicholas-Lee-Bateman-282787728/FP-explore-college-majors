5192241,1,B008YUHP1K,"Hard to imagine any justification for watching, other than as an example of how not to create an entertaining film. Full frontal nudity, yeah! If that's what you're looking for, you can find it in this thing (I don't want to call it a movie, it's not a film). To call the video poor is to insult poor video quality B movies. Apparently, the producer thought grainy is great! I assume there is some attempt to tell a story, but the overall quality is so poor as to distract from any message from this effort.",1440201600,2,507,4.347368421052631
5192242,5,B008YUHP1K,"Documentary about a lesbian relationship with the backdrop of making a porn film.  This is a very powerful movie. Sharon Mitchell is ""Mitch"" in the movie and plays the free spirit, uninhibited, take life as it comes, live every moment as if it were your last, pure life force.  Tigr Mennett is her girlfriend always in search of something deeper, deeper meaning, deeper love.  The personalities are a natural conflict and also a natural counter-balance.

There's no real resolution, just sort of a few days in the lives, but it pulls you in and gives you an authentic view of a world (set in San Francisco).  I very much liked this movie and it was absolutely not what I expected.",1438300800,8,680,4.633333333333334
8532768,3,B008YUHP1K,"Mitch is a trip to watch, Tigr gives me all the crazy ex-girlfriend feels, Greystone is such, such, such a sleaze. I felt gross after watching this but Sharon Mitchell is worth it and the film-within-a-film aspects of the doc are intriguing.",1486598400,,241,4.761904761904762
8532769,2,B008YUHP1K,"I spent the entire documentary trying to understand why she was the ""it"" porn star of her day. if you're in the mood for background TV, with the occasional ""what is going on"". What this documentary.",1482883200,,198,4.527777777777778
