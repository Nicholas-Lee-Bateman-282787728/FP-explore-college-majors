3D - Out of Screen Effects (Aka: Pop-Out Effects) -  4.5

I was somewhat hesitant on if Sadako 2 3D would live up to its predecessor's 3D effects. The first movie had plenty of gimmicky pop-out effects that not only made it fun to watch, but also made it scary. Without reading any reviews on Sadako 3D 2's 3D, I didn't know what to expect, but hoped the pop-out effects would be good, if it even had any ( I had no idea if it did). And yes, it was then a great relief to realize it did have pop-out effects, and these did not disappoint. The first 5-10 minutes, in 3D, is nothing but amazing. If you see these few minutes in 3D, you will be astounded by it. I sat there, smiling like a doofus, as the first sequence occurred. It is clear that the team behind  the first movie wanted the 3D effects in this one to be just as good, or even better.

3D - Depth - 2

This is why for the overall 3D rating is 4. Depth in Sadako 3D 2 is not the greatest, it's flat and is only noticeable when it wants to be, such as the subtitles. Most of the time they don't hover on the screen like they did in the first movie, but only do when to emphasis what the characters are saying. This is actually kind of clever, though it may come across as confusing to some viewers.

Short Review of The Movie - 3.5

Sadako 3D  didn't have the most favorable reception from critics, but I still liked it. It was a modern update on the Ringu series and had fun 3D effects. Now, with Sadako 3D 2, the story takes a more dark and creepy tone. Sadako may not be gone, she may be within someone who seems small and innocent.  If you enjoyed the first movie, you will most likely enjoy this one. It didn't necessarily scare me, but I felt the horror and creepiness it evoked. Let's hope there's a chance for Sadako 3D 3.",1443398400,,1924,4.1066666666666665
