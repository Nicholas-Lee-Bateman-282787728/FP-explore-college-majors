3432898,3,B0019CWRZE,"Otto Preminger's 1949 version of Oscar Wilde's ""Lady Windemere's Fan"" shortened to simply ""The Fan"" was scripted by Walter Reisch, Dorothy Parker and Ross Evans is sadly what Otto himself called ""a mistake,"" something he even knew but perhaps did not admit during the making.  It bookends the Wilde drawing room play with modern-day post-war extensions of the play's action and by Darryl Zanuck's order, they also stripped the dialogue to too much Wilde robbing the characters of much of their real power, and Preminger perhaps noticed during the making he could not make the play as ""dark"" as he wanted without keeping Wilde's sense of goodness.  Jeanne Crain was second choice to play Lady Windemere (Gene Tierney became pregnant), but she is very good, as are also George Sanders (in a romantic role) and Richard Greene as her husband.  But the film belongs to Madeleine Carroll who is magnificent as the scandalous adventuress.  Unfortunately, the lack of a solid style for the film leaves us void of emotional connection to the proceedings or the characters, which might have started to be intentional, (some of the visual motifs for going in and out of the flashbacks are interesting and we do get the suggestion of the title and its effects of the proceedings and characters), but truly appreciating the film becomes hard to sustain without the emotional connection to something.  Of all the film's left in obscurity (I can think of a lot of 20th Century Fox titles still without DVD or any home video presentation), the fact Otto Preminger produced and directed it, must have made it a candidate of their Cinema Archives MOD series.  I am glad he is bankable right now.  But this must be his most forgotten, in matters of connecting with the audience.",1365811200,4,1759,4.882550335570469

3432900,4,B0019CWRZE,"It's rather a nice and pleasant film version of the Oscar Wilde play, although 20th Century-Fox took a lot of liberties. So don't expect a duplication of the play. However, a good cast highlights the festivities with Jeanne Crain beautiful in period costumes.",1361059200,,259,5.046511627906977
3432901,4,B0019CWRZE,"Jeanne Crain and George Sanders star in this period drama about a married couple threatened by a mysterious woman.  But there is a twist that takes time to come out and makes the story very compelling.  Based on the book ""Lady Windemere's Fan"" by Oscar Wilde.  The movie benefits from the usual manipulative performance of George Sanders.  While not a top notch film it is certainly worth watching, especially for fans of Crain or Sanders.",1359331200,2,439,4.8133333333333335

8273503,5,B0019CWRZE,"It has been decades since I read ""Lady Windermere's Fan,"" and now remember only how much I enjoyed it, and the gist of the climactic scene. Therefore, I was able to watch this not as a film version of Wilde's play, but as a movie on its own grounds. And, on its own grounds, I heartily enjoyed it, was caught up with the characters at once, and found it both skillful and fascinating to follow the way the original story unfolded in a post-Blitz framework. Wikipedia tells me that contemporary movie critics disliked this version; but for myself, rather than complaining about how many of Wilde's witty lines had been sacrificed, I felt gratified surprise at how many of them remained; and rather than bewail the loss of so much (rather brittle) wit, I thought they made an excellent job of rounding the story out with human depth and emotion. I expect I'll be watching this one rather often.",1516838400,,892,4.616352201257862

8273505,4,B0019CWRZE,"The Fan is a delightful 1949 black and white film based on the famous play by Oscar Wilde (1852-1900), with changes. Critics consider it underrated, and I agree. The Fan is just one of about a half dozen different versions of Wilde's 1892 play Lady Windermeres Fan. In the film, an old lady tries at an auction to acquire a fan that once belonged to Lady Windermere. She says the fan should not be sold; it belongs to her; it was given to her as a gift. The auctioneer states he will hold it while she gets proof that it belongs to her.
She goes and finds a man she once knew who she reminds about the past, so that he will come to the auction house and give evidence that the fan is hers. He is now quite old and needs to be reminded of what happened decades ago. She tells him how she worked to make sure that Lord and Lady Windermere would stay together and that Lady Windermere would not be seduced to leave her husband by the man she is now addressing. She explains that unknown to Lady Windermere, she was not as young as she looked, she was not trying to seduce Lord Windermere, as Lady Windermere thought, and she was Lady Windermeres mother.",1501459200,,1150,4.255707762557078
