I  use  to  watch  both  shows  every  now  &  then,  both  Love boat  &  fantasy  island.  I  think  anyone  would  enjoy  love boat.
Its  not  quite  the  same  as  a  cruise  line.  But  its  a  chance  for  couples  to  get  back  together  in  case  their  relationship  is  falling  apart.  After  talking  over  their  problems  with  different  people  a  solution  on  how  to  fix  the  love  affair  completely  finally  comes  along.
Every  episode  at  the  end  makes  us  all  feel  good.  &  differences  can  be  solved  in  the  most  positive  manner.

3874756,3,B0028SVY3Y,"I Bought season one vol 1-2, and season 2 volume one and two.
And I loved them
The price is not quite $40.00 per season for a two volume set.
Which seems a little bit steep, but when you consider the fact that each season includes 6 disc's and the number of episodes in included on the disc's it's not too shabby,
If you're really into the show.
My only complaint is the length of time it has been since they released the first two seasons and the third season hasn't come out yet.
The show ran from may of 1977 to may of 86 according to Wikipedia with four hour long special's between 1987 and 1990
I watched it with my parents, and grandparents, when I was growing up,
And it seems to me that it ran from 1977 to 1990 with a break between 87 and 1990
But that for every year that it ran from 1977 to 1987 it ran a full year,
So that's 10 years worth of episodes,
And then from 1987 to 1990 it seems that they aired 4 TV special's.
While others would have the majority of fans believing that it only ran for 9 seasons between may of 1977:and may of 1986,
With 4 Tv special's between 1986 and 1990
My concern is that it's bad enough that it's taking them so long to release the complete series.
And to top it off,
I think they are trying to get out of releasing a whole season's worth of episodes.
And not for nothing,
But releasing each season as a 2 vol set is a waste of time and money,
You would make more money by releasing each season as a complete set instead of breaking each season down into two volumes.",1458604800,,1513,4.063545150501672

3874764,5,B0028SVY3Y,"I absolutely loved watching seasons 1 and 2 again after so many years. Why hasn't Paramount CBS released seasons 3 to 10? It is all about GREED. I just wrote to them twice in the past week asking/begging them to release the whole series. I loved watching this cast and all of the guest stars appear in these early episodes. The one with Vicky Stubing was one of the best ones! Very touching. Many laughs and also sentimental moments were captured on this show. CBS, if you read these comments, you will agree to release the whole series in one set.

Those of you reading the comment, please email CBS Paramount on their website. It only takes a few minutes!!! Thanks.

I will say I was quite irritated when it arrived though.  The show gets 5 stars.  The company selling the DVD's gets 1 star, so that works out to 3 stars only because I enjoy the show.  ALL four of the DVD cases arrived to me completely smashed.  I'm still checking discs to make sure they all work properly.  If they all do, I'll keep them and just replace cases.  I don't want to hassle returning them and getting something worse.  SO...I realize I only paid half of what many people paid, but I still fully expected to receive unbroken merchandise.  The cases are cheap.  The ""cost"" really wasn't.  It's a good thing I'm an easy going (mostly) person.  Release some more seasons!

It's fun to watch all of the late 70's fashions, to see how people actually dressed up to go on a cruise and to see so many big names before they were stars. Just last night we saw Billy Crystal and Kathy Bates as young cruisers on the ship. This is a fun series for the whole family... the only downfall is that it will make you wish you had a time machine to go back to 1977 and 1978 when this first aired.

3874788,5,B0028SVY3Y,"I am not going to get into the price debate, as that has been
well covered.
It seems as though the Love Boat series, is going through the
same issues/problems, that many other of the shows from that
time span have had.
China Beach, Happy Days, Bay Watch, WKRP, Welcome Back
Kotter and a few others,were held up by legal disputes and claims
that took years to resolve.
The Love Boat had a good size cast, and an enormous amount of
guest stars, that have to be dealt with, as in signing off, and getting
whatever monies they might have coming to them.
Hopefully all those problems can, and will be worked out one day.
For now, enjoy Seasons 1-2.",1427760000,2,643,4.366666666666666

3874794,4,B0028SVY3Y,"This was a great light comedy series, very well written and well played by both the regular and guests casts in each show. Watching the first few shows, I was surprised just how many laugh out loud moments I still found more than 30 years after I first saw this series. Guest cast included some of the top comic talent of it's day, as well as older actors from previous eras ... but still giving solid performances in their spots on Love Boat.

The picture is pretty good on these shows, and the soundtrack is OK as far as the dialogue goes. Music, especially the iconic opening theme, tends to be scratchy and distorted.

Still, these shows are a lot of fun, and it started the vacation cruise boom that exists to this day.

3874825,4,B0028SVY3Y,"THE LOVE BOAT was a dramedy that ran on ABC from 1977-86 revolving around the ship's captain and a handful of its crew, with several passengers - played by different guest actors, celebrities, and cameos for each episode - having romantic and humorous adventures. In fact THE LOVE BOAT was part of ABC's popular Saturday night lineup that included FANTASY ISLAND until that show ended in the Summer of 1984 and TJ HOOKER until it was ousted by ABC in the Summer of 1985.

Something else that baffled me about this dramedy was how the ships Dr. Adam Bricker(Bernie Koppell)was always getting laid while a bunch of other guest starred passengers were humping around too, even before sex, violence, and profanity corrupted television, including raunchy sitcoms like MARRIED WITH CHILDREN.

The original 1976 television film on which the show was based (also titled The Love Boat) was itself based on the nonfiction book The Love Boats by Jeraldine Saunders, a real-life cruise director.

It's also nice to be able to watch each episode complete & uncut without all those added commercials & deleted scenes you got when this show was on ME-TV, TV Land, E!, and now Pop-TV.",1400544000,,1168,4.888888888888889

She would actually ""bribe"" all of my brothers and sisters to ""let her"" watch it on Fridays or Saturdays - whatever night it was on - with peppermint patties.  So, for her 75th birthday I bought her this - season 1 & 2 along with a bag of peppermint patties. I wish I took a picture of her face when she opened it.  She was truly excited and I really believe she will watch this. Like I said, she never watches TV but It's been 30 something years so I believe she'll watch these.

My suggestion, wait for a complete box set for a normal amount, or leave it be. A disgrace to treat such a great series, and the fans of it, with such disrespect. Do they really want to sell any, with this price I wonder.",1359158400,4,371,4.166666666666667
3874851,3,B0028SVY3Y,"Though this series is being sold with both of the available seasons, I would much rather buy a series offered in its entirety. That way I will have the entire show all at once. The thing that is wrong with that is often I, like many other fans cannot afford that at the time or the series is simply priced to high. Believe me, studios know what they are doing when they release these series by the season. They know that fans will buy them that way because they are more affordable at that time. But then when the fans buy by volume then it becomes a nuisance, and a headache. Usually not because we are just waiting for the next volume, but we are also wondering and waiting for the next season.
This series has not seen another season release since August 4, 2009. This is a shame because it is such a good, quality show. Fun and fantasy at it's best. And for such a low price too. One of the things I have come to realize is many shows often goes down in price once they have been available for awhile. If a fan is willing to wait, eventually the price may become far more attractive than the original selling price. If you're like me, you wouldn't prefer to wait. I prefer to get my copy as soon as it becomes available. I don't like to wait on enjoyment, which is probably why so many fans are upset about pricing and having to buy in volumes.
Another thing that I don't like is the way the discs are formatted. I truly dislike the disc returning to the menu after each episode. However, the disc does scroll to the next episode, which is good, just in case you don't have your remote control. So every forty-five minutes or so I am returning to start the next episode. I prefer a ""Play All"" feature. Though it is wonderful to have the episodic promos, which can be viewed separately or played with the episode and ""The Movie Of The Week: The New Love Boat"" on season one, volume two, it just doesn't justify this cost. It would be better to buy each of these separately, but probably all at the same time to avoid extra postage cost.",1354838400,3,2039,4.271317829457364
