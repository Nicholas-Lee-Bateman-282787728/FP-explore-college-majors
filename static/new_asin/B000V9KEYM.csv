8217616,5,B000V9KEYM,"Danny Gill is an excellent tutor so I had no qualms about paying what I think is a relatively hefty $27 for this DVD. As it turned out, I wasn't disappointed - Gill takes the viewer slowly through several of Zakk Wylde's tunes taken from solo albums like Sonic Brew to Pride & Glory. Each track is broken down into intro, verse, chorus and guitar solo, and Gill slows all of these down so you can see exactly what's going on. Of course to be able to play the solos up to the correct speed would take tons of practice but at least intermediate players will be able to get a good handle on all the rhythm parts pretty quickly. Highly recommended for all students of hard rock/metal guitar.",1202774400,,687,4.333333333333333
