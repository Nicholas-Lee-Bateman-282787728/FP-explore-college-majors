8140279,4,B000HLDC8Y,"Against the backdrop of the Marcos dictatorship, Mike de Leon's masterpiece explores a Nun's awakening to the political and societal realities of Manila and of the Philippines.

Sister Stella Legaspi (Vilma Santos) is a nun who started her religious duties in the convent, but chancing upon the problems outside her cluster, she began a radical transformation by becoming involved in the problems of society. It was a dangerous time for filipinos who are vocal and critical of the workings of the Government of then dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Many critics have been subjected to tortures and many have disappeared. But there remain courageous filipinos who continued to rally against tyranny.

The film tackles some of the most important issues during the dark times in Philippine society- media censorship, labor unions and the clash between religious and political ideology.

De Leon's direction is superb, controlling the flow of the film from start to finish. The cast is also commendable. Led by acclaimed actress Vilma Santos, she portrayed the nun with conviction and grace, blossoming from an innocent bystander who felt secured inside a convent to a radical political figure who can lead a mass demonstration and make a difference.

The film is considered one of Mike de Leon's masterpiece, and was an entry to the 1985 Venice Film Festival.

During these times when few Filipino films are recognized for tackling serious, relevant issues, Sister Stella L remains a testament to the Philippine film industry's ability to deliver and produce noteworthy films.",1167177600,3,1567,5.27710843373494
