8026379,5,B0002CZUG0,This is my favorite yoga DVD and I have owned many. It is has several options for different types of workouts at different levels. Some days when I want a bit lighter of a routine I can choose a beginner routine and other times I can go through the intermediate routines.,1487635200,,271,4.333333333333333
8026380,5,B0002CZUG0,I like the DVD I have bought Yoga for Inflexible People and Yoga for Everybody.  Now my son is in wrestling and this is working fantastic for him and myself.,1428192000,,157,4.233333333333333
8026381,5,B0002CZUG0,"This DVD always has something to offer because it has sequences for beginner, intermediate and advanced. The instructions are clear and many of the floor exercises are very restorative. I have owned and used this for several years.",1420070400,,231,5.105263157894737
8026382,5,B0002CZUG0,"I fell in love with yoga through Megan Garcia's DVD, progressed through Barbara Banagh's Beginning DVD (which was the perfect next step!), and then got this.

I have been using this DVD for years. It must have been about three years ago that I progressed to the full ""challenging"" workout. And I have been doing it regularly ever since (on the days I have two hours for yoga).

It had been two years since I had finally gotten into and mastered upward bow when I decided I needed new challenges and shifted some of my yoga to Rodney Yee's Intermediate Practice (for the handstand). And subsequently his Power and Burn practices (which I absolutely love also) along with a Shiva Ray flow collection (for days when I only have a half hour or so--and these are also good, but not for those intolerant of new age-y language/cliche --years ago I would have wanted to strangle her, but that's another story).

Today, after almost a month of not using this DVD, I was a little afraid that I would go back to it and find I had outgrown it. But the opposite happened. I re-realized how extraordinarily thorough Banagh's instructions are, and how challengingly long she has you hold poses for.

The challenging full workout is, handsdown, the most complete feeling practice I have ever done. It took some time to work up to it through the ""intermediate"" level, and it is incredible how the challenging-full-workout continues, after several years (I want to say four or five) of regular use, to challenge and soothe exactly as yoga should.

As with any kind of learning, her instruction is not perfect for everyone, for every pose---I've gotten more and more out of this DVD by supplementing with classes and other DVDs, but it is remarkably thorough --the absolute best instruction outside of a class. (but other approaches will definitely help you get the full out of every pose)

You will get to know ""basic"" poses like you never have before. Even her sun salutations will kick your ass because they are so slow and deliberate they make all other routines feel shoddy and superficial.

Buy it. You won't regret it.",1409875200,,2106,4.722070844686648
8026383,4,B0002CZUG0,"Links movement to the breath.
Different levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced.
Also the sessions have it listed how long they are.
Which is handy, many times I am on a schedule.",1390780800,,184,4.967741935483871
8026384,1,B0002CZUG0,"I decided to try this workout after reading the previously posted positive reviews, but I was so disappointed that this one will probably be going to half-price books.  I wouldn't even pass it along to a friend.  The voice-over is way too loud over the music, and the voice is not at all the calming type one would expect for yoga.  I ended up turning it way down and playing classical music over it.  The cueing was equally frustrating as I had to keep craning my neck to look at the screen and understand what was being described.  The workouts were not challenging in either the areas of strength or flexibility, nor did tery flow well from beginning to end.  Skip this one; try Rodney Yee instead.",1285027200,3,701,4.480314960629921
8026385,5,B0002CZUG0,"I've been an intermediate level ashtanga practitioner who recently developed shoulder soreness (probably because of the repeated chaturanga dandasana), and was looking for a DVD that would allow me to retain the core strength I had developed through a regular ashtanga practice. This DVD takes portions of the primary series such as the sun salutations, standing poses, back bends, forward bends and twists. What Jason demonstrates are modifications of the ashtanga asanas that actually allow me to go deeper into the pose than the traditional ashtanga practice. I think this is because the flow is much slower and gradual. I also love the fact that she emphasizes how long it may take to reach the full form of some of these poses and the importance of working at the edge. While I do still really miss my ashtanga practice because of the emphasis on the Ujjayi breathing and the Heat, I am sure the use of this DVD will strengthen my practice when I do return to it.",1240790400,,968,4.767857142857143
8026386,4,B0002CZUG0,"This is a valuable DVD, if not quite ""For Everybody"" in the same way that J.J. Gormley's DVD in this same series is.

The main strength of the program is the combined teacher voiceover of Benagh and the inspiring demonstration of Jason the student.  Benagh is calm and does a great job of focusing your attention on core, not surface strength.  I like it when she tells you to breathe into tight areas ""as if your lungs were there.""

My main complaint is that the skill level required from segment to segment seems to vary widely, at least within the Beginner workout (the only one I've done so far).  If you do the full 90 minute workout, it starts off with very slow, eminently doable warmups, and then moves into a highly modified sun salute using a chair ""for those of you who find the other versions on this DVD too challenging.""  You think, ""Great, piece of cake.""  Be prepared, though---over the next hour or so you'll end up doing revolved triangle pose, side planks held FOREVER, a full cobra that pulls forward into upward dog (also held FOREVER), and even an advanced arm balance.  (That part always makes me laugh---the ever-calm Benagh shows brief excitement, saying, ""You're in Bakasana!!""  I always answer back, ""No, I'm not."") I do think it's odd that they give all this stuff to the same people who might have trouble performing unmodified sun salutes.  I've even toyed with the possibility that my DVD is defective, tracking to advanced sections where it isn't supposed to.  If so, let me know!

At any rate, this DVD is nice and challenging and full of useful insight, though not really for rank beginners.  I can't wait to find out what the Intermediate practice is like (some far-off day when my arms are stronger).",1143763200,5,1736,4.6524590163934425
