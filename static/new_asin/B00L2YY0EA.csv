6463620,4,B00L2YY0EA,"""Cold In July"" (2014 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Richard ""Rich"" Dane (played by Michael C. Hall, he of TV's ""Dexter"") and his wife and young boy. As the movie opens, we are reminded that we are in ""East Texas, 1989"", and Rich and his wife are awakened by what sounds to be a house robbery in progress. Rich checks it out and when he confronts the intruder, he shoots and kills the intruder. Turns out the intruder was a wanted felon, or so Rich is told by the local cop. At the funeral, the dead felon's dad (played by Sam Shepard) shows up, and he threatens Rich's family. At that point we're not even 30 min. into the movie but to tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is based on the crime novel from Joe Lansdale. I did not read the book, so I can't comment on how close (or not) the movie stays to the book. Second, this movie feels like a wonderfully tacky B movie crime caper like they used to make them in the 50s and 60s. Third, the movie really takes off when about one hour into it, Don Johnson appears on the screen (he plays the role of a detective), and frankly he steals the movie with this role. Johnson hasn't brought this good of a performance in quite some time. Watch out for the last 15 min. when all is revealed! Last but certainly not least, there is a terrific electronic soundtrack to the movie, composed by Jeff Grace, and reminding me of similar scores from Tangerine Dream and John Carpenter back in the late 70s and early 80s. There are also some incidental 80s songs in the movie, including White Lion's ""Wait"" which plays over the movie's end credits.

Bottom line: I wasn't really sure what exactly to expect when I went to see ""Cold In July"" a few weeks ago. Turns out this is one heck of a surprisingly strong B movie crime caper. It takes a bit of time to develop and set up the overall direction of the plot, and that's quite alright. The screening at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, which is a shame, as ""Cold In July"" surprised me in a pleasant way. When do they start work on bringing Joe Lansdale's ""Hot In December"" to the big screen?",1403049600,26,2282,4.304651162790698

6463659,4,B00L2YY0EA,"Pulp fiction doesn't come much better than Cold in July, a gritty, grisly - and perversely giddy - crime yarn directed by Pottstown-born indie-film provocateur Jim Mickle.

Adapted by Mickle and writing partner Nick Damici from Texas author Joe R. Lansdale's 1989 hardboiled thriller, Cold in July is one of the most hyperbolic, absurdist crime yarns since David Lynch's Blue Velvet redefined the genre.

Packing more plot twists than a bag of pretzels - and shot through with a mordant humor just as dry - the film features a cast as idiosyncratic as its style and oddball mood shifts.

Dexter star Michael C. Hall is virtually unrecognizable as the story's Everyman hero Richard Dane, a mullet-and-mustache-sporting small businessman, devoted husband, and father, who is celebrated by his small East Texas town when he shoots a burglar in his house.

Things start going haywire after local cop Ray Price (played by screenwriter Damici) tells Richard that the intruder's father, ex-con Ben Russell (Sam Shepard), wants to avenge his son's death. The 70-year-old Shepard exudes a menacing vitality as the gun-crazy Ben that's awe-inspiring.

Crazy really comes to town with the addition of Jim Bob Luke to this hallucinogenic goulash of explosive masculinity. Don Johnson steals the show as Jim Bob, a smooth-talking pig farmer and private detective who rides a hot red Cadillac convertible - with, yes, a pair of longhorns attached to its grill.

It's difficult to describe Cold in July without giving away its various twists and turns, each more outrageous than the last. Suffice it to say, the story pits Richard against a rising tide of evil involving the Dixie mafia, a snuff-film ring, and corrupt cops.

It ends, as you'd expect, with a bloodbath.

Mickle's talent lies in his intelligent handling of genre stories. He uses horror tropes such as medical atrocities (Mulberry St.), vampirism (Stake Land), and cannibalism (We Are What We Are) to lay bare the ugly underbelly of small-town life.

He excels with Cold in July, a bracing, stark, and shocking portrait of the dark specter that haunts the American Dream.",1447891200,2,2122,5.0922190201729105

6463670,4,B00L2YY0EA,"Here's an American noir film set in a 1980s Texas town containing enough intellectual heft for some and plenty of raw guy emotion and vengeful violence to satisfy most. The moral ambiguity rides along with everyday guy Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall, of Dexter fame), while Ben Russell (Sam Shepard) and Jim Bob Luke (Don Johnson, really terrific), along with Dane, furnish the slaughter.

In the middle of the night, a sound awakens Ann Dane (Vinessa Shaw), who rouses husband Richard. Richard goes to the closet, takes down a box containing a revolver. He loads it with shaking hands, then creeps to the downstairs, where he finds the B&E guy. The fellow shines a flashlight in Richard's eyes, panicking Richard, who accidentally pulls the trigger. The cops show up and though reassured constantly by Det. Ray Price (Nick Damici) that he fired in self defense, Richard agonizes over the fact that he killed a man.

Turns out Richard killed Freddy Russell (Wyatt Russell), son of bad guy Ben Russell, who has just been released from prison. Ben's a man who holds a grudge. So troubled by the shooting, Richard shows up at Freddy's burial, where Ben threatens him. Later, Ben compounds the terror by breaking into Richard's house while the police surround it.

Eventually, the cops capture Ben and everything seems resolved. But wait, a twist intrudes, when Richard discovers the cops spiriting Ben from the jail and leaving him unconscious on the railroad tracks minutes before a train appears on the horizon. Richard can't allow another man to die, even bad to the bone Ben. Also, by this time, Richard suspects he didn't kill Freddy but a stand-in. Something's very wrong here, he's thinking.

After exhuming the substitute Freddy, he convinces Ben he didn't kill his son. Ben enlists his friends help solving the riddle. Enter Jim Bob Luke in a bright red caddy. This unlikely grouping forms a friendly alliance. Jim Bob's a pig farmer and private eye, who uncovers the truth. Freddy indeed lives, having turned Fed informer on the Dixie Mafia (apparently a real thing; who knew?). He's now in the witness protection program, a lowlife now shielded by the cops. Worse, Freddy's engaged in making snuff movies (unfortunately a reality). This offends Richard, Jim Bob, and especially Ben's sense of morality, and they take action, bloody action.

So, there you have it, Richard, at first depressed at shooting the fake Freddy, transforming into an avenger, joining Jim Bob and Ben, who already operate on the margins of the law (corrupt in this film), deciding what warrants, morally warrants, extreme intervention. Quite good stuff and thought-provoking, if you step back from the action a bit.",1437868800,,2696,4.99554565701559

Set in East Texas circa 1989, no detail is overlooked-hairstyles, clothes, cars,etc..What seems to be a justified shooting of a felon who broke into Dane's home is a web of lies designed to protect a rapist/murderer.

That a person would care that he shot someone else did not make sense. If I shot at night, Mr. ABC and discovered that it was not Mr. ABC would I care that much? Why I did not know Mr. ABC to start off with, maybe the police made a mistake, I am just happy its over? I certainly would not go galloping away to find the truth on some vigilante crusade.  Nor do I believe the police would go murder someone so amateurish  to cover up a person hiding under witness protection.

The acting itself is quite good,  both Michael Hall (in particular) and Sam Shepard played well; I think everyone played skilfully. They were believable there was nothing wrong there. The characters were interesting too. I really liked Michael Hall character and found him fascinating.

6463688,5,B00L2YY0EA,"Cold In July is deceiving in its description.  It leads viewers into thinking the story's going to be entirely about a father/husband who murders a man who breaks into his home late one evening while the family's asleep only for the father of the deceived man to plot calculated revenge, and for a while this aspect of the story is significant and even suspenseful (though clichd admittedly).  For at least 35 minutes, the clichd writing serves a purpose however- that being, the story is about to head off in a VERY different direction!  This film is NOT entirely about a father getting revenge on the man who murdered his son.  It's cleverly implemented though to make viewers think it's going to be based around that, but truthfully the writers of this film realized that particular kind of storytelling has been done a million times by this point so something fresh was required, and it works really well.

I really hate to do this but I don't have a choice.  In order to write a review I sort of have to unintentionally give away SPOILERS.  If you don't want to know what happens do NOT read any further!  Stop reading my review right now people!!!

If you're still reading, let's continue!  It's soon discovered that the man buried wasn't the robber who broke into the house.  It was someone else entirely.  The cops are involved in a crooked cover-up of some kind.  After the father sneaks around one night and witnesses the cops of this small southern town beating up and lying down the father of the deceased robber on train tracks, the father does the right thing by saving his life as a train rushes by despite just a few scenes earlier (during the suspenseful house break-in) worrying that this very same man is plotting revenge against him and his family and needs the cops to protect them.  What a twist huh!

From here, like I said, a very different story develops.  Now it's all about the father of the family (played by Michael C. Hall) the father of the robber (uh, I think he's played by Sam Shepard, but there's another older fellow who resembles him- that being the cop) and another guy played by Don Johnson, going on a travel mystery cruise in their truck to discover what REALLY happened to the father's son since it's realized a different man was buried in the graveyard.  Well they go digging him up and discovering it's not the father's son to confirm any suspicions, so these 3 gentlemen travel around the countryside looking for clues pertaining to the whereabouts of the son.

They eventually come across a suburban area and after a hilarious fight scene with a much bigger gentlemen they stumble upon VCR tapes.  Ahh!  I'm honestly spoiling too much as it is so I'll stop spoiling the movie now.  Anyway it's all about revenge from here on out (a different kind of revenge compared to what occurred in the beginning) so expect an abundance of shooting and killings and perhaps more importantly expect the atmosphere to make a natural transition from suspenseful in the beginning when the writing was derivative Lifetime Movie Network quality storytelling to a much more disturbing direction involving... involving... sorry I'm not spoiling anymore.  I'm sticking to my guns here folks!.

Perhaps the writing could've been better in spots.  Perhaps it could've been elaborated less confusingly and more interestingly.  Not everyone's going to like the sudden change in storytelling, in addition to the change in atmosphere.  Going from suspense to detective-like mystery isn't going to make everyone happy despite the really good payoff at the end (well maybe I shouldn't say ""really good""- what turns out to be the two main characters and their eventual interaction that most of us probably knew was coming could've been elaborated upon a little longer for additional, better constructed emotion) and not everyone's going to like the writing overall since sometimes the movie does occasionally drag a little bit.  Though honestly it never dragged as much for me as it might for others- that's personal opinion there.

I also think Michael C. Hall's character was a little off.  He was suitable enough, but surely someone else could've played his part better.  Yeah he's a loving father, yeah he cares about his family and wants to protect them but... he's sort of dry in a way.  Like he has a nonchalant attitude and doesn't put a whole lot of emotion into his character. Plus he was portrayed as weak and timid.  His son also had a nonchalant attitude, like he didn't care at all that his life was being threatened a couple times through the mysterious and tricky actions and words of the robbers father.  Not that this matters after the first 30-some minutes of course.

It also felt like these southern folks were a little too laidback given the events that took place with a violent shooting in a man's home.  Surely a small town like this would whisper rumors and feelings of apprehension and disapproval of the father's actions even though he was simply protecting his family and home and did nothing wrong.  Yeah they give him funny looks at the breakfast diner but that's really it.  I guess I expected the townspeople to get involved more in some way.  These are minor complaints at the end of the day however, because the movie really is terrific all around.  I highly recommend this one.  Keep watching to find out what's on those VCR tapes!  It ain't pretty though, just a warning.  It's sickening.",1427846400,,5441,4.769230769230769
6463689,3,B00L2YY0EA,"The best part of this movie was Michael C. Hall's haircut.  It was a creepy movie with terrific acting on all fronts,  But it does not keep one's attention long.  In fact, the main character is very weak and frightened--a turn off.  Yet he follows his curiosity into places that a timid man would not.  Hard to believe. Plus, he's a country boy who does not know anything about guns?  Yeah . . . right.  And of course you have the emotional outbursts by the married couple that make no sense, even under stress.  The annoying little boy pays the price on this front.

6463691,5,B00L2YY0EA,"This is probably really a 4 star movie but I am going to be a little biased because of the low ratings.  I typically have not liked Joe Lansdale's books but this is good little crime thriller set in Texas in 80's.  Michael Hall, Sam Shepard, and Don Johnson all do a good job.  Hall's character doesn't show a wide range of emotion.  None of the actors do but two are hard men and the third learns to be hard.  There are a few scenes that are hard to watch which involving the filming of a video (some readers may recall Hardcore from 1979).

Much better than the average explosion filled Hollywood movies with no plot.  Anyway, this is based on a Joe Lansdale book and I think it turned out well.  I have always criticized Lansdale not for his plots but because all of his characters (rich, poor, black, white, educated, illiterate) speak with the same voice.  His plots are usually decent.

6463712,5,B00L2YY0EA,"""Cold In July"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: How can a split-second decision change your life? While investigating noises in his house one balmy Texas night in 1989, Richard Dane puts a bullet in the brain of a low-life burglar, Freddy Russell. Although he's hailed as a small-town hero, Dane soon finds himself fearing for his family's safety when Freddy's ex-con father, Ben, rolls into town; hell-bent on revenge. However, not all is as it seems. Shortly after Dane kills the home intruder, his life begins to unravel into a dark underworld of corruption and violence. Twists and turns continue to pile up as the film reaches its inevitable destination: a gore-soaked dead end.

The cast led by Michael C. Hall (in a solid, well-crafted performance as Richard Dane), Sam Shepard (solid as usual as Ben Russell) & Don Johnson (in a superbly, well-crafted performance as Jim Bob) is excellent. The directing by Jim Mickle (also co-wrote the screenplay & co-edited the film & also one of the VFX artists) is excellent. The screenplay (based on Joe R. Lansdale's novel, who also co-produced) by Mickle & Nick Damici (who also appears as Ray Price) is excellent.

The music by Jeff Grace is excellent. The cinematography by Ryan Samul is excellent. The film editing by Mickle & John Paul Horstmann is excellent. The casting by Sig De Miguel & Stephen Vincent is excellent. The production design by Russell Barnes is excellent. The art direction by Annie Simeone is excellent. The set decoration by Daniel R. Kersting, set dressings by Alan Dickson & Bridget Rafferty is excellent. The costume design by Elisabeth Vastola is excellent. The make-up by Jessica Kelleher, Brian Spears & Pete Gerner is excellent. The visual effects supervised by David Isyomin are excellent. The special effects coordinated by Phil Beck, Jr. is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Anthony Vincent is excellent.

This is a well-crafted and well-made suspense thriller that is entertaining and intriguing, as well as interesting, too. Michael C. Hall gives a solid and well-crafted performance in his first movie role since the ending of ""Dexter"". He is impressively, backed up, by Sam Shepard, who is in solid form as usual and Don Johnson, who is superb in a well-crafted performance as Jim Bob. Jim Mickle has made his best movie to date, so far, with it being the best venture of Mickle & Nick Damici, who also appears in the movie as Ray Price, thus far. This is (or was) also one of the best movies of the 2014 summer season and not only, one of the best movie thrillers of 2014 and one of the best movie thrillers in the years.",1423353600,,2622,4.835189309576838

6463730,4,B00L2YY0EA,"[SPOILERS]
Joe R. Lansdale is a writer I'm familiar with primarily via the comics medium. His 1990's take on Jonah Hex with artist Tim Truman was one of the best things Vertigo ever published, and they've got quite a few classics bearing their logo. This film adaptation of the Lansdale novel 'Cold in July', by director Jim Mickle, displays the writer's talent for crime fiction, a kind of Western Noir set in nineteen-eighties Texas. It begins as a solid thriller about revenge, but twenty-five or thirty minutes into the movie, you'd be surprised to skip ahead an hour and find that everything has suddenly taken a hard left off the asphalt, down a narrow forest trail that could end abruptly with a deadfall of massive redwoods, or go all the way to the Yukon... metaphorically speaking.

Michael C. Hall is still scraping off the psychic residue from the final disappointing seasons of 'Dexter'. He plays family man Richard Dane, a frame-maker who has little in common with Dexter Morgan, until he accidentally shoots and kills a burglar. The act has consequences that are completely unexpected, leading him into a frankly insane plot to murder a den of serial killers. Neither time nor space nor mullet and moustache can keep Hall from killing killers, it seems.

The local sheriff is uncharacteristically friendly and reassuring, taking care of the inquest and sweeping the dead burglar named Freddy Russell into his State-financed pine box and shallow grave. Then again, it is Texas, where shooting intruders is an official past-time. As Dane and his wife deal with cleaning up the blood and brains that has stained every square inch of their modest home, corrupting the memories and associations that bind together the physical house with the idea of home, there is a suspicious and disturbing convergence of events: the dead man's father has been released from prison, just as his son has been killed.

After an ill-advised trip to witness the sad, solitary burial, Dane meets Ben Russell face-to-face. Sam Sheppard still commands an effortless intensity few actors can match, his soft, almost toneless inflections capable of conveying a formidable sense of menace. He makes it clear that he means to seek vengeance for the death of his son, and later breaks in to Dane's home to leave a clear threat on the life of Dane's toddler child. The police use his family as bait, and wait for Russell to make his move.

While the story is compelling enough, the 'Cape Fear' premise is a well-travelled one. But Lansdale shows off his chops as a crime novelist when the problem seems prematurely resolved. The Sheriff calls to let Dane know that Russell has been apprehended, and all is far too well, far too early. As he returns to the police station to complete some paperwork, a cursory examination of the bulletin board yields a strange discovery: a 'Wanted' poster of Freddy Russell clearly depicts a face that bears no resemblance to the man he killed. The Sheriff is suspiciously dismissive of Dane's concerns regarding the dead intruder's identity, but he was also responsible for making the ID in the first place.

As the poster continues to bother him, he makes an evening trip to the police station, and is stunned to see the Sheriff and his deputies dragging a handcuffed Ben Russell into a vehicle. He follows them to a quiet railroad crossing, then watches in disbelief as the cops drug Russell, douse him with liquor, and leave him unconscious on the tracks, hastily departing as the train rounds the bend. Dane makes the fateful decision to rescue the man who wanted blood atonement, keeping him chained up in his dead father;s remote cabin. His efforts to convince Russell that Freddy was not the man he shot are pointless, until they finally resort to a midnight exhumation. The corpse is not Freddy, but someone went to great lengths to keep anyone from proving it, removing the teeth and fingers.

Dane and Russell form a tense alliance to get to the truth, and the elder man enlists the aid of his fellow Korean War Vet and Houston P.I., played by Don Johnson. The film picks up gravity and velocity, taking the viewer into some nasty places. Richard Dane's involvement is voluntary, and it's difficult to imagine a family man without combat experience choosing to follow Russell on his grim and likely suicidal mission. Nevertheless, director Jim Mickle's propulsive cinematic translation of Lansdale's breakneck narrative pace is impressive, convincing the viewer to suspend disbelief and save the questions for later. The performances are thoroughly brilliant, and the film benefits from the strange chemistry between Hall, Sheppard, and Johnson. It doesn't quite possess the visceral poignancy of 'Blue Ruin', or Mickle's previous film -- 'We Are What We Are' -- but it's an excellent example of crime fiction done right. Highly recommended.

6463757,5,B00L2YY0EA,"I make no secret of being a Joe R. Lansdale fan, so I find it kind of surprising how he has been a published writer for decades and how very little of his work remains adapted to either big or small screen.  One thing I will say is that for those few adaptations such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubba-Ho-Tep/dp/B00993HGUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubba Ho-Tep </a>&nbsp;and the movie I am reviewing here, there seems to be a great deal of love for the source material that compels the filmmakers to put out one hell of a good movie.  I have a great deal of respect for Stephen King, but let's face it, a lot of movies based on his work are terrible. With Lansdale, it is clearly a case of quality winning over quantity.  Even if directors such as Don Coscarelli and Jim Mickle are not very well known, the amount of love and respect they put into filming one of my favorite writers place them into my own list of favorite directors that would for other people be occupied by Nolan, Tarantino, and Scorsese.

  The story takes place in a late 1980s East Texas in which a frame builder named Richard Dane (played by the horribly mulleted Michael C. Hall) fatally shoots home invader Ben Russell out of fear for his safety and that of his family's.  Seeing how the deceased has a lengthy criminal record while Dane is a respected businessman and pillar to the community, the police want to let the matter drop.  However, the dead man has a vengeful father (Sam Shepard) who doesn't quite see eye to eye with the police on letting Dane off the hook.  From there, a series of confrontations that escalate in intensity culminate with Russell nearly exacting his revenge through Dane's son and Dane learning the truth about the man he killed.  Dane and Russell form an uneasy alliance to learn the truth with help from a foul mouthed, pig farming, Korean War veteran / private investigator Jim Bob Luke (Don Johnson).

  Adapting a relatively short novel such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-in-July/dp/1616961619/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold in July</a>&nbsp;might not require a big budget, it does however require the proper actors to pull off its characters.  Hall is superb as someone who can be both a loving father/husband and a bully who snaps needlessly at his wife and son.  The underrated Nick Damici (who worked with Mickle previously in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulberry-Street/dp/B0019RP6KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulberry Street</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stake-Land/dp/B005FJ7DOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stake Land</a>) does a wonderful job portraying the Texas cop who is not quite what seems to be.  Who else can play a grizzled, backwoods badass better than Shepard?  Not many.  Most impressive of all is Johnson.  When I read a book, I'm one of those people who casts actors and actresses to the characters.  I would not have chosen Don Johnson when I first read this book in 1998.  Now that I have seen the movie, I cannot imagine anyone else playing Jim Bob.  I'm not ashamed to say it when I say that he has really grown on me these last few years.

  Something else that is extremely well done is the violence.  I am not some prude that blames all of society's problems on the overuse of violence in the media, but I do like how this movie does not glamorize it in anyway.  For instance, when Dane kills Russell in the beginning, Hall excellently captures the fear of someone placed in that situation.  That would be the true emotion rather than heroic bravado.  When it comes to the final shootout with the villains, the violence is certainly anything but a bloodless confrontation.  In fact, it is brutal, stomach churning, gory mayhem that demonstrates almost as accurately as possible that bullets do nasty things to the human body.  It is sickening even if the people who get killed are sickening people who make films like ""Batting Practice"" (watch and you'll know what I'm talking about).

  I do not give Cold in July five stars out of a bias toward Lansdale.  I give it five stars because I have read the book, watched the movie, was able to compare the two with and against one another, and decide for myself that the film not only succeeded, but excelled in its objectives.  If there is one gripe to be had, it has to do with the fact that there is no contact between Dane's wife and Jim Bob.  In the book, there was a bit of tension that was present because of Jim Bob's boorishness. It does not do anything to really diminish the quality of the movie, but it does provide a reason to caution people the movie does not follow the book 100% even though it is an otherwise superb adaptation.

6463766,5,B00L2YY0EA,"Joe Lansdale is one of my favorite authors and this movie, taking place in 1989, is based on the book of the same name, published in 1989.

First of all, it felt like being back in 1989 in the movie, from the old Mercury station wagon with the ""wood"" panels on the side to the hairstyles and clothes to the old cell phone and typewriter. Great job with the settings.

Michael C. Hall playing husband/father Richard Dane, did a super job, albeit far different from his DEXTER role, playing a protective, diffident man. He kills a man who breaks into his house.

And then...
Sam Shepard plays father Ben Russel, father (supposedly) of the man who was killed. Recently out of prison, he starts terrorizing Dane and his family.

Then, because of unforeseen circumstances, everything changes. Don Johnson, playing the fantastic role of private detective Jim Bob Luke, comes into the picture and the action really picks up.

Memorable characters, a convoluted storyline, believable settings - all pay homage to one of Lansdale's classic novels.

Of interest...
Joe Lansdale has a cameo in the movie. And Joe's daughter, Kasey Lansdale, a country singer, wrote and performed some of the music soundtrack.",1416700800,5,1197,4.930348258706467

I mean, I kept the movie paused in the background, and went back to it/finished it, but obviously if the story were more plausible and tautly told I would have kept watching from beginning to end without inventing frivolous distractions for myself. But aside from finding some of the story hard to believe and some of the plot lines being unresolved, it was very well acted, and fun to see a movie that harkens back to when we had to use land-lines and answering machines--devices that really lend themselves to the art of suspenseful story telling. I did appreciate the opening scene (spoiler alert!) in which Michael C. Hall so nervously and shakily handles a gun. Every single television show and movie leads us to believe that everyone is cool-as-a-cucumber when using a fire arm. The reality must be sweat and shakes and adrenaline and fear, and Michael C. Hall had me feeling all of this. Don Johnson was wonderful as was Sam Shepard, and Wyatt Russell is incredibly compelling--he could have just skated by on just being gorgeous, but he brought a depth and creepiness--and ultimately pathos--to his few moments on screen.

6463770,4,B00L2YY0EA,"This is director Jim Mickle's fourth major outing, having given us `Stake land' and the remake `We are what we are'. This time he has taken the novel set in 1989 by Joe R. Lansdale (who has a cameo as a priest) and done rather a good job. It is about a couple, Rich and Ann Dane and their young son; one night while asleep in their backwoods house they get a burglar. Rich gets his dad's old revolver and plugs the guy.

Well the local sheriff turns up and identifies the guy as a known and wanted felon; so he gets a pat on the back. Then he is told that the burglars daddy has just been paroled from Huntsville prison and will be none too chuffed. Sure enough Big Daddy `Jim Bob' comes a calling and makes it clear he is more an eye for an eye man rather than the `turn the other cheek' sort of guy.

What ensues is a tale that keeps the twists coming and just when you think you might have got it straight, it throws things in the air again. A really good story line is made better by excellent performances from Michael C. Hall (`Dexter') as Rich Dane and a grizzled but effective Don Jonson as `Jim Bob'. The music is all eighties synth stuff too and adds to the very impressive period detail for the setting of this film. Loads of tension, loads of twists, great performances and an outcome that meant the edge of the seat was getting truly worn out - recommended.",1416614400,2,1370,4.1856060606060606

The plot is a little to convulsive and moves on too quick, and the characters and their encounters are somewhat unrealistic.  For instance, in real life the character played by Michael C. Hall would not volunteer to do what he did. Ordinary folks, especially with families don't do such things.  This movie is sort of in Tarantino's ballpark...or I might be wrong.  What is wroth mentioning is the music: a country/blues with electronic vibe similar to the now cult soundtrack of Drive (2011).  Cold July (2014) is a movie with a plot that can be compared to films such as: 8MM (1999), Blue Ruin (2013), and No Country for Old Men (2007).

6463810,4,B00L2YY0EA,"Potential spoilers.

This film is set in 1989, the same as Joe R. Lansdale's novel, in east Texas where the KKK and the neo-Nazi party fight for political supremacy.  Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall) is a quiet, unassuming art-framer who owns his own shop in town.  As he sleeps at home with wife Ann (Vinessa Shaw, ""Side Effects"") and his young son in the next room, he hears noises downstairs.  He locates a revolver inherited from his dad, loads it and carefully goes to investigate.  He discovers a burglar.  Both are surprised and Richard, almost by accident, pulls the trigger, killing the intruder.

The police tell him he has killed a vicious criminal with a past and that he should be proud that he protected his family.  But Richard is unsettled by the shooting.  Things get worse when police detective Ray Price (Nick Damici) tells him that the burglar's father, Ben Russell (menacing Sam Shepard), has just been released from the state penitentiary.  I know what you're thinking.  It all sounds just too familiar, especially after Ben starts hinting at revenge and shows up at Richard's son's school.

But things take a hard left turn, when Richard spots an old wanted poster of the man he supposedly killed.  And the picture isn't that man.  Unconvinced by the explanation from Price, Richard accidentally comes upon Price and other policemen taking the captured Russell and tying him to a railroad track.  Richard rescues the drugged Russell and takes him to his father's cabin in the woods.  They form an unlikely alliance to find Russell's real son, Freddy (Wyatt Russell).  Then another hard turn, brings in Ben Russell's old war buddy, Jim Bob (excellent Don Johnson).

Jim Bob is a combat vet, private detective and pig farmer.  He has a big cowboy hat and drives a red Caddy convertible with longhorns attached to the grille.  They find Freddy who is involved with the Dixie mafia in a despicable crime that makes even Ben gag.  While all of these events are turning, Richard has plenty of opportunity to return to his wife, son and framing business.  But for whatever reason, he can't.  He has to see it all through to the end.  To his credit, director and screenwriter (with Damici) Jim Mickle doesn't allow Richard to become an instant `Rambo'.  While he certainly has moxie, he's still just an everyman.

Somewhat surprisingly there are at least 3 different movies going on here.  And that is what makes it interesting and at the same time tonally muddled.  I liked the film enough to see it again.  Perhaps I'll be less sensitive to the directional changes.

I saw this movie on Blu ray which maintained the 2.40:1 aspect ratio of the theatrical release.  It has a video resolution of 1080p.  The filmmakers were obviously interested in giving the film a somewhat muted look of a 1989 film, so often the lighting seems a bit unnatural, especially in the nighttime scenes.  Various shades of blue are seemingly everywhere.  I did see a few artifacts on my 63"" display but they are not serious and will likely not be seen, especially on smaller screens.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is excellent.  The audio is filled with plenty of ambient sound coming from a rural setting.  Everything from insects to pig squeals.  The car crash and ultimate gunshots are well placed and sound authentic.  The terrific musical score by Jeff Grace is well displayed.  Dialog is clear and discernable even with the various accents.  The score is also offered as a separate track.  There are other interesting extras including 2 different commentary tracks.  One is essentially performance oriented and the other technical aspects.  There are some deleted scenes, pre-visualization tests, a Q & A with some of the principals and some trailers.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.",1415059200,2,3819,4.852713178294573

6463812,4,B00L2YY0EA,"I like the actors more than the story, in which an average family man, Hall, kills an intruder that broke into his house one night.  Turns out the burglar has a father, Shepard, with a long history of criminal activity that has just been released from prison.  He is quite upset with the man that killed his son and makes threats.  So far it's business as usual but then the plot twists begin.  Nothing is as it seems.  The father brings in a friend, Johnson, that is a private detective and they, along with the son's killer, unravel a coverup that culminates with a major gun battle in which everybody gets shot.  Who survives?  The movie is a little slow in places but it's worth it to see the ending.  Due to some sex scenes and graphic violence this movie isn't for the kiddies.",1414972800,4,783,4.388888888888889
6463813,5,B00L2YY0EA,"Why did I wait so long to see this? It may be content to stick to the basics of a mystery/thriller, but they are executed so well with several excellent twists and turns, and backed up with some great performances, that I didn't mind at all. The gist of the story is that someone breaks into Richard Dane's (Michael C. Hall) house in the middle of the night, and he shoots the intruder out of fear. An investigation is started, statements are taken and it is found that the intruder was a wanted man, Freddy Russell, whose dad just got out of prison on parole. Now, with the father stalking him he and his family still feel unsafe in their home. Then, to top it off he sees a wanted poster in the police station that raises more questions than it answers. So as not to spoil anything, I'll stop describing the plot here.

 The greatest thing I can praise this film for is a tense, and sometimes unnerving atmosphere that kept me at the edge of my seat pretty much the entire time. This is helped a great deal by the synthesizer-based score, which reminded me of something John Carpenter might have done back in the day. In fact, the first 30-40 minutes of this movie reminded me a lot of Halloween. After that first part, it shifts to more of a standard crime/revenge drama but the scoring remained appropriate and impeccable.

 I should also mention the excellent performances by the entire cast, but particularly by Michael C. Hall. I'm not too familiar with his work on Dexter, but this seemed as far removed as possible from that character. You really got the sense that this was a family man who hesitated to resort to violence, and it changes irrevocably changes him afterwards. It was a great character arc to have, and it was very believably portrayed onscreen. Supporting him were Sam Shepard and Don Johnson, who both do great work here as well. Before you find out more about his character, Sam Shepard was very effectively menacing without having to do much at all, and once he was introduced, Don Johnson almost stole the show with a dramatic performance that also had some elements of humor in it as well. Even the lesser supporting cast (including the child actor who plays Michael C. Hall's son), although not given as much to do, are excellent.

 Overall, there's an overwhelming amount of positives and very few negative things I can say about this film other than that it maybe sticks too close to genre tropes and doesn't develop its supporting cast as much as it could have. Still, this was a tense and riveting watch from beginning to end. If I had to compare it to something, it did remind me a bit of BLUE RUIN, which also came out this year. If you're a fan of well-executed crime dramas, this is one of the best 2014 has to offer. Highly recommended.",1414972800,15,2776,4.5199203187251

6463828,4,B00L2YY0EA,"This film is differently made.  [the most helpful '2 star'' review seems pretty fair]
  As you can see I gave ""COLD in JULY"" 4 stars.  I'd say that there are, at least, 4 Acts to this- instead of the usual 3 Acts.  Also, the biggest problem seems to be that there aren't really any sub plots.  One feels, as if, the full meal was only vegetables or sugar free snacks.  Thus, after viewing, it just feels that something is/was missing.  **Note**: I am intentionally being vague because I do not want to give away the story's 90 degree turns.
  ""COLD in JULY"" starts with a home invader being killed.  We see how different people in town react.  Then the invader's father wants his pound of flesh.  Then we find that the ""author"" has used slight of hand and what we thought our adventure would be isn't.  Thus ends Acts I & II.  Now a new Act has us on another- very different- ride.  For us to find direction we now must rely on a pig ranching, PI [aka: Don Johnson].  This will be either Act(s) III or III & IV.
  The film turns in a very mean, cruel, and violent  directions.  The invader's father is forced to handle ethical questions and make hard decisions. This will lead to either Act IV of Act V- depending on how you wish to look at it.
  My definition of 'Film Noir' is: ""All main characters are lessened and can never fully shack the ghosts that will haunt them for the rest of their lives; if they lived.""  No good will ever come of/from this event.",1413763200,,1460,4.283088235294118
6463829,4,B00L2YY0EA,"I really enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone looking for a good hard-boiled thriller.  The film is also true to the book's 1980's setting and deserves a place in the sub-genre of detective noirs set in the 70s or 80s (No Country for Old Men, The Lovely Bones, etc.) that's popular at the moment.  The only shortcoming that I could spot in the film was only obvious to me as a fan of the book on which it's based.  Joe Lansdale is a phenomenal writer and his books are well worth reading because not only do they deliver a visceral punch when it comes to plot and imagery but Lansdale is also great at bringing out the psychology of his characters and exploring the complexities of human relationships.  One of the best things about the book is the way in which the relationship between Richard Dane and Ben Russell develops over the course of the story.  In fact, I would make the argument that the real heart of the book isn't the twists and turns of the plot (clever and surprising as they are) but an exploration of the bond that develops between two men who, in a better universe, might have been father and son.  This aspect of the novel is almost entirely absent from the film.  Though the film still delivers, If felt the absence of this element keenly, and I consider its omission doubly unfortunate since Michael C. Hall and Sam Shepard are both strong enough actors to have really done something with it had the script engaged it.  So, short and sweet, watch the film then read the book and strap yourself in for a good, if harrowing, time.",1413676800,2,1559,4.445614035087719

Hall gathered together in what started out as a heartfelt reaction to a home invasion that kept me watching, even though it almost got a bit slow, more because of the mundane role of the wife, but it added to the realism of the story, nonetheless.  But, with the twists and turns around each corner that I didn't see coming, the momentum intensified and the storyline kept becoming more and more intriguing...and then Don Johnson entered the scene with his old Miami Vice style and charisma blasting away with maturity and I was even more appreciative that I had paid the money to watch this movie.  The excellent acting and thought provoking storyline literally held me hostage in front of the screen, sometimes eyes popping and breathless.  And I say this with the caveat that I abhor violence, blood, guts & gore (especially the overworked living dead grossness), but this movie addressed political and human issues typically hidden away and the violence was presented in a fashion that communicated reality coupled with tough choices and immediate consequences. .

6463844,5,B00L2YY0EA,"A very well put together movie, based on a solid story by one of my favorite authors, Joe R. Lansdale. This is a noir in the classic sense, by which I mean that it is a crime story, but the hero is not a detective or an officer, but a regular person who gets caught in a jackpot. (Please forgive me for a minute as I discuss the story as it's laid out in the original novel, since this movie is actually quite true to the original, on multiple levels.)

In the best of these suspense stories, the hero is not simply an innocent victim outside forces, but is also a victim in part of his own passions, fears, prejudices, and sometimes greed. The hero is called to be unexpectedly heroic, despite himself, but it's never that simple. (I'd love to be able to cite examples of a female hero, but in these types of suspense stories the male protagonist is the norm.)

Lansdale, author of the original novel behind this book, does not simply follow the old plot formulas and cliches. There is no femme fatale to be found here. But the story is told from a male perspective, and you could even say an old fashioned sense of the nuclear family. At the center of the hero's conflict within himself is what it means to be a man: what it takes to protect one's family; how to live up to your father's legacy; how to answer what feels like a duty, taking extreme actions while preserving your family's view of you as a person who could not even imagine such a thing. And isn't that part of what it means for a man to protect his family?

Lansdale introduces some great twists on the classic Gold Medal pot-boiler plots. In addition to avoiding the femme fatale trap (following the example of the great suspense writer Charles Williams), Lansdale adds a further twist by turning the second half of the story into something more like a western, where a band of heroes are called to pull together in order to dispense with some very unpleasant business, for the good of all, even if it means giving up the thing most important to you. This layering of real characters, suspense, violence, plot twists, and genre bending is why you read Joe R. Lansdale, and why we'll see more movies based on his excellent novels.

The hero of Cold in July is a family man, who wants to hold on to what is his, but who is also called to a higher sense of justice, when real injustice is laid right at his feet. Here again: what does it mean to be a man--in society? What is our responsibility to do the right thing--to make a judgment and act--when the worst of the worst is put in front of you. After you have already secured your family's safety from a prior threat, where you could choose to turn away and be secure, will you put everything on the line to make to right an injustice and prevent future victims? Will you act outside the law when the law itself has been corrupted?

Instead of turning this into a super-long review, I trust others will be commenting on the production, direction, acting, and music, all of which are very well done. I want to watch my BluRay a few more time anyway! The pacing is very tight, without sacrificing too much from the character development. Lansdale's trademarks of showing the face of real, not cartoon, evil and showing the visceral realities and costs of violence are faithfully represented.

One thing I really liked about the movie is how much attention to detail was paid to to capturing the 1989 Texas setting. The clothes, workplaces, home decor, appliances, everything is a perfect match for that time. Even the soundtrack music is crafted to sound like it could have been in a 1989 movie. But they weren't making many noir movies this good in 1989.",1413072000,23,3672,4.464977645305514

Exactly one complaint: While I enjoyed the soundtrack, sometimes the volume of the music overwhelms the rest of the film. I found myself adjusting the volume whenever the music started fro that reason. I'd maybe have considered demoing a portion of a star for that, but one of the songs is by Kasey Lansdale so all is forgiven. ;)
The humor is properly twisted, the violence is, well, violent, and despite what some might fear it's not over the top. Nor, frankly, does it have to be.

Placed mostly in Greece in the 60's, this suspense flick follows a couple of well-to-do tourists (Dunst and Mortensen) who meet and befriend an American tour guide (Isaac) named Rydal. Rydal's a bit of a scammer, but he is taken with the handsome couple, first by their charm, and then by the fact that he ends up helping them dispose of a dead body. Secrets, suspicions and doubts unravel as the three of them are forced to travel on the run from the law.

The Hitchcockian influences are pretty strong here -- the soundtrack alone begs the comparison -- and they show strong form. Edits are brisk, character development is as snappy and lush as the movie's palette, and the story has that stumbling anything-can-happen atmosphere that dominates so much of Hitchcock's best stuff. The performances are pretty much dead on, and although the characters aren't particularly likeable, they are still complex enough to be interesting.

There are a few issues with the plot, mostly that the third act is prompted by a moment of stupidity so aggressive that it is an obvious contrivance to raise the stakes on our threesome. I won't give much away, other than to say that it involves someone running off of a bus for ludicrous, childish reasons, and it results in a bit of meandering in the storytelling that makes everything feel like it's wandered into a completely different film for fifteen minutes. Also, there is a bit of father/son symbolism at play in the script that works very well at the start of the film, but which gets shoved into the audience's faces by the end, mostly in some dialogue that is a bit too on the nose.

This silliness aside, this lushly filmed and briskly told story is otherwise engaging and doesn't overstay its welcome. FOUR STARS

COLD IN JULY
One night, Rich (Michael C. Hall) shoots a home intruder in the face, killing him instantly. The intruder's father (Sam Shepard) comes looking for revenge, but it turns out that things are more complicated than they initially appeared. As the two men enter each others' orbits, the revelations that ensue take them into progressively darker and more gruesome territory than they ever expected.

As with the other film, the performances here are spot-on and almost artistically muted. Also, like the previous film, the story-telling is top notch. Although it doesn't explore its themes or actions with a whole lot of depth, the turns and twists are compellingly consequential, and they give the film that itchy no-telling-what's-next sensation that keeps eyes on the screen, even when some of it stretches a bit thin. The dialogue is sparse and in service of the movie's overall atmosphere of actions tumbling to an unknown but unavoidable conclusion.

The soundtrack here is a bit more forced, though. The events take place in Texas in the late 80's, and all of the music has that retro-synth sound that you'd expect in a typical 80's B-movie slasher or sci-fi flick. Sometimes it works and sometimes it's just jarring and weird. Likewise, our main character, Rich, tends to act as a sort of placeholder for the audience, and when the story starts to move into especially dangerous territory, the movie doesn't work hard enough to explain why Rich sticks around. There's a half-hearted stab at an explanation (mostly he's just curious), but it doesn't totally jive with his character. This weak connective tissue isn't a big deal, all things considered, but it does add some to the silliness.

Just as much concerned with fathers and sons as THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY, this film doesn't totally throw its morals or message in your face. And also like that other film, it lets its story play out in an almost extemporaneous fashion. The end result feels endearingly sloppy and authentically entertaining in the way that more predictably formulaic movies are rarely able to pull off. FOUR STARS",1411344000,,4223,5.040114613180516
6463868,3,B00L2YY0EA,"""I didn't kill your son. The cops have been lying to us all along."" Richard Dane (Hall) is a normal everyday man. Late one night he hears a noise in his house.

After a little more investigation they both realize the cops lied to them about the identity of the intruder and they set out to find out why and where his son actually is. I'll start by saying that this isn't a bad movie at all, it's just very slow. I could tell the movie tried to be tense and gripping but the pacing of it didn't allow the movie to get where it needed to go. This type of movie has been done before where two people who are enemies at first begin to work together but this one was more about the psychological aspect of what is going on.

6463870,5,B00L2YY0EA,"How many men can a single bullet kill? It's a great question and the perfect tagline for such a lead-laden film as Cold in July -- the fourth feature from visionary director Jim Mickle and his writing/acting partner Nick Damici.

Based on John Lansdale's novel of the same name, Cold in July begins with a tense home-invasion that quickly culminates with an intruder's head splattered against a wall and the killer, mulleted family-man, Richard Dane (Michael C. Hall), in near catatonic shock. Unfortunately for Joe, the worst is far from over when he discovers that the late intruder's father, Russel (Sam Shepard) has just been paroled from jail. From here, Cold in July toys with the concepts of justice and revenge as Russel wants vengeance for his son's demise while Richard wants nothing more than to keep his family safe. While that would be a decent -- if typical -- narrative for a standard ""revenge-thriller"", such a premise is but a starting point herein as the story gruesomely blossoms from something rather elementary into something grand, unpredictable and ultimately tragic.

Together, Michael C. Hall and Sam Shepard (who looks and sounds an awful lot like Michael Rooker) perfectly convey two brokenly haunted men on separate ends of the fraternal spectrum. Hall and Shepard dig deep and pull out characters who are both worth empathizing with and sympathizing for. There performances carry the somber spirit of the film while Don Johnson's role as Jim Bob brings a welcome dose of humor when he arrives halfway through the sordid affair as a pig-farming detective. Classically played by the ol' Miami Vice star, Johnson brings a much needed sense of levity to the stone-cold tone while also offering some of the more somber moments and a healthy shot of friendship to the two men who are most in need of it.

While I won't venture to spoil anything beyond the initial premise, I was constantly hooked by the natural progression of the plot and its gradually escalating darkness. The focus of this bullet-riddled noir isn't simply on the nature of violence begetting violence, but rather, a meditation on fathers, sons their duties to each other, the families they raise and the sins they reluctantly pass on. Such themes are devastatingly realized in the movie's final moments which convey sadness, happiness and closure without so much as a single spoken word. For all of the slow-burning plot points, however, rest assured that Cold in July manages to deliver the vicious goods during the last act with a realistically grim, neon-drenched shoot-out that acts as a cathartic period of punctuation to all of the proceedings. Bullets ricochet, knives slide across arteries and a pelvis even finds itself pulverized by a point-blank shotgun blast. Thankfully, whereas many present-day films are solely concerned with the evil of humanity and the victim's lack of defense toward it, Cold in July presents both victory and loss in its garishly-lit and realistically violent conclusion.

What betters the finale and, well, everything before it, is the absolutely phenomenal soundtrack which features a plethora of excellent electronic music akin to John Carpenter's audible work from the 80's and a brilliantly bad-ass use of Dynatron's ""Cosmo Black"" during the ""suit-up"" moment of our three paragons. Composer Jeff Grace utilizes such juicy synth goodness to maximum, head-bobbing effect for each and every scene; each and every tonal shift. Whereas the musical compositions of the first act are moderated to sweat the gloomy tension and put the audience on pins and needles, they seamlessly transition into heroic beats to accommodate the arc of the protagonists -- especially that of Michael C. Hall's nave Richard Dane, who undergoes the most dramatic overhaul during one of the movie's best crimson-drenched scenes. Most interesting of the musical compositions is the recurring piano theme which accompanies each act of the film and serves to reinforce the human element of each male figure and the paternal bonds each possess. The tracks entitled ""Official Protection"", ""Dane's Cabin"" and ""Father and Son"" are the most consistent examples of this recurring theme and serves as an audible display of the characters' pathos. It's also interesting to note that the final song entitled, ""Back of My Smile"" (which plays over the end credits) was written and performed by Joe Lansdale's daughter, Kasey Lansdale, and boy does she have some pipes!

The only area in which further elaboration would have been appreciated (but not needed) regards certain plot threads that (while minimal and outside the boundaries of the main conflict) could have used some explanation and/or closure. Regardless of the seemingly inconclusive nature of these few plot points, the central dilemma is handled perfectly and passionately.

Much like the recent (and equally devastating) Blue Ruin, or the upcoming film, The Guest, Cold in July has heralded a resurgence of retro-themed films that recall the very best of genre filmmaking from the 80's and early 90's; decades in which the power of storytelling was about structure, characterization and mood -- not on the biggest budget, the biggest actors, the most egregious use of CG, product placement and hashtagging.

Crafted with moderation, heart and respect for what came before it; Cold in July is one of the best, most dark-heartedly hopeful films of the year and deserves to be remembered as such. It's a heart-breaking descent into inhumanity, but an uplifting morality tale of wounded men, their fears, failures and means of redemption. Movies of such greasy, Texan ilk don't get any better.",1408752000,2,5646,5.157205240174672

I was extremely surprised that I could watch him and NOT think the whole time that I was watching an episode of Dexter.  He is a massively underrated actor (IMO).  That being said, Sam Shepard also did a phenomenal job as Russel.  Of course, we can't forget Don Johnson, who has, for some reason or another always been in that category of ""it can't be that good if he's in it"" which I NEVER understood cause he's AWESOME!

Whoever thought that Don Johnson would have any kind of chemistry with Dexter what so ever, must have been out of there mind, as right from the beginning, this film was doomed. A simple man kills a home invader and is stalked by the father of the man he killed. Obsessed with taking a life and wanting to know more about what led to this man become the person he's become, Dane (Michael C. Hall) and his team of misfits, stalk the family right back and uncover an even bigger mystery. While this story had potential, the writers thought it was too dark and decided to have some fun with it. Isn't that nice of them, to combine misplaced comic relief with actors who have no chemistry at all? Cold In July doesn't only lack chemistry but it also lacks focus. At times this film is as dark and serious as it gets, then just as quickly everyone is drunk and paling around, it just doesn't fit and it doesn't work. The whole genre of these films is dark, disparaging, and sometime disturbing. If their is any humor or positivity to be had, it typically occurs at the very end. Michael C. Hall pretty much has the same dry personality as Dexter, except with a family and a conscious, while Don Johnson is the psychopath who wants to hurt people and thinks it's funny. The bottom line is this film is just a mess of actors who don't belong with each other, characters who should never have gotten along, jumping between scenes that are the complete polar opposites of one another. I liked the story and there are a few interesting moments, but it's just isn't enough to carry the film.",1488844800,,1894,4.492753623188406

8663464,5,B00L2YY0EA,This is a really good suspense/thriller with great stars and a plot twist that I didn't anticipate. Dan Stevens is quite good in a modern role that is nothing like his Downton Abbey performance.,1485734400,,194,4.735294117647059
