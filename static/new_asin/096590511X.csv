7793822,5,096590511X,"A chance to learn from the Bravest Man I know.
Yes, it works.  But more than that, it is critical for as many people as possible to learn this technique. Our freedom is at stake.  Major Dames took an huge risk taking a technology that was classified into the public arena.  He had to give up his career in the Army to bring this to us.  The abilities that you will be cultivating are your own God-given faculties.  The reason for the widespread ridicule of ""PSI"" abilites is to keep humanity in slavery to a very tiny power-elite.  Humans are miraculous sensing and discriminating beings.  We all have them, but we must be kept unaware of them lest we begin to sense the web of secrets that keep us wage-slaves. Think of it.  If you are able to collect information on any person place thing or event any time in the past present or future, then there will be NO MORE SECRETS.  Another side-effect from the development of your abilites (and the most important one, I believe) is the REAL-ization that WE ARE ALL ONE.  I want everyone to learn this attention management skill.  It is no longer an optional activity for fun.  It may mean the difference between human survival and extinction. There are many teachers of this technique out there.  Many are very very good.  But Major Dames is the Luke Skywalker of the genre.  I suggest that you grab your chance to learn from the best teacher available.  (The original Technical Remote Viewer, Ingo Swann...) no longer teaches.  Be there, or be square!
Afterthought...I see a review by someone who tried to use it to catch what he believed to be his unfaithful wife, and failed.  There are many possible reasons for his failure that have nothing to do with the teacher or the technology....a word, to the wise, is sufficient.  Love from your sister.",1031702400,6,1795,4.588050314465409
7793823,5,096590511X,"This is really very powerful technology, that is much more than meets the eye. At first I was skeptical that such a thing would really work, that you could travel into the future with your mind and access information about anything. Well then I did what the video's said, creating a blind target test and was amazed that my first time I was able to perceive the target. Did I say wow! Apparently everyone has this innate psi ability, and these tapes teach you how to train and expand upon it. I continue to totally amazed by this potential. I am currently using remote viewing in my business, doing weekly trajectories and it  is proving invaluable. Thanks Psi Tech.",971481600,9,666,4.5966386554621845
7793824,5,096590511X,"I purchased these tapes and have been using them for some time now. I would say they are quite straight forward. As far as technique, the TRV tapes give you a step by step easy to learn  process that anyone can follow. The tapes also inform you about how the process of Psi works. It is a skill that is trainable for almost anyone and highly effective. I was stunned by the results.",969753600,4,382,4.232876712328767
7793825,5,096590511X,"I became interested in remote viewing several years ago, when the various personalities were first being interviewed by the media.  After researching the field, it seemed that every training course available cost thousands of dollars and required one to travel.  I became familiar with PSI TECH and when I heard Ed Dames announce these tapes, I ordered them immediately.  I successfully learned TRV from the instruction on these tapes.  Do not expect to simply watch the tapes once and become a proficient remote viewer.  This is an in depth course.  Technical Remote Viewing is a learned skill.  I can sum up learning it with two words: Surprise and frustration. Learning remote viewing is a lot of hard work and you'll spend many hours practicing.  With Module 1.0, the first tape in this course, you start out remote viewing basic gestalts, such as land, water, mountains and man-made structures.  This Module teaches you Stages 1, 2, 3, ideogram decoding and basic level target cuing.  The second part of this course - Module 2.0 teaches you intermediate target cuing and preparation, how to construct analytical sketches, movement exercises, Stage 4, problem solving skills and construction of the Idea Template, along with data analysis. There is a lot of information to absorb.  Expect to spend several weeks working Module 1.0 level targets before moving on to Module 2.0.  A friend of mine, who is naturally gifted, immediately started doing high quality work using TRV, but she still surprised and amazed herself.  This course has proved to me that remote viewing is an innate ability that all humans possess.  The structure, developed by Ingo Swann at SRI, at the Army and DIA military units and at PSI TECH, teaches you the language of communicating with the collective unconscious. It keeps you on the signal line. Unlike naturals, who have difficulty knowing when their imagination takes over, remote viewers trained in these techniques can recognize imagination, or analytical overlay.  This technology is truly fascinating.  If you need assistance while learning, PSI TECH offers free technical support in the TRV online classroom. The presentation of the lectures and imagery is well done, directed by William Gazecki, an Oscar nominee. Purchasing this set of tapes is one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I can't adequately express in words what it feels like to open the target envelope, and see that my sketches and descriptions match a target exactly. I have never experienced anything like it.  I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in remote viewing.",969667200,14,2600,5.09433962264151
