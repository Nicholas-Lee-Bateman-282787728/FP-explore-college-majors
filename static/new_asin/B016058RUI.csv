7454751,5,B016058RUI,"Now I have to say this is a complete Blu-Ray. If I could add anything I'd like to see more Cinemasacre content on these Blu-Rays and the DVD's. But overall that's just my small nit-pick. This is a nearly perfect Blu-Ray. Loads of extra content, hours of laughter, and a whole barrel full of fun. This is a must for any die hard AVGN fan or Motha F**ka Mike! Buy it, you won't regret it.",1445212800,,386,4.16
7454752,5,B016058RUI,Such a great show with two great personalities. Truely the next generation in media and entertainment. These guys are the pioneers of a new movement of criticism thats redefining what it means to be a critic. Love it!,1445212800,3,217,4.7368421052631575

7454755,1,B016058RUI,"Selling Let's Plays is bad enough, but these aren't even complete (or particularly good) Let's Plays. James is boring when not in his AVGN character, and Mike is annoying.

James needs to go back to making AVGN episodes.",1445212800,31,220,4.7894736842105265
7454756,1,B016058RUI,"""Let's Plays"" are the craze on YouTube, where people play various videogames while recording themselves in a commentary matter.
YouTube icon Angry Video Game Nerd has for several years now been grasping to stay somewhat relevant after 'angry reviewing' has become less and less popular. So this is Angry Video Game Nerd (James) together with his annoying friend Mike doing ""Let's Plays"", something that exists in a overload for free on YouTube, but here put on a overpriced Blu-Ray disc in order to grab some money. The entertainment value is poor and production value is non-existent. This is just another cash-grab by James. Who ever since his (commercially failed) movie have turned out to be just a greedy guy pretending to care for his fans.",1445212800,23,746,4.976

7454759,5,B016058RUI,Fantastic show takes me back to the days of gaming when you and your friends sat around a tv and played games when multiplayer was passing the controller would highly recommend it,1444867200,29,179,4.625
7454760,4,B016058RUI,I love these guys but dame it these is blue ray just put all you videos.,1462838400,,72,3.5625

7454763,4,B016058RUI,This blue ray is full of old school video game fun. You don't see this kind of stuff on ign. Highly recommended!,1456790400,,112,4.136363636363637
7454764,3,B016058RUI,"Definitely confused no one else has brought this one up?

It does not have many episodes, not as many as you would expect at least. James and Mike have some good episodes, but I can't say the ones on this disc are really ""best of"" This made me a little sad, and just writing the review made me conflicted about posting it. However I can see how putting things on a Blu-ray is harder and things in HD take up space. It was overall just a disappointment, but hey all the Youtubes are still there and free! [...]
Pros:
Supporting Cinemassacre (Which is a great brand!)
Some of what you want....

Cons:
Definitely Incomplete, even for a ""best of"" (James and Mike have 145 Episodes, this has 20 combining the two part-ers)
May not be the ""best of"" James and Mike Mondays.
Will NOT play with VLC out of the box, same as AVGN-X. You may need PowerDVD with BR support! (Hope I am right on this one, 2 hours and got no where with VLC and Potplayer)",1455753600,,939,4.269662921348314
7454765,4,B016058RUI,"Love the collection of episodes. I think they should have made this an entire collection instead of a ""best of"" though. There is a fairly good amount of content, but I went through it quick and there's little replay value, unlike the AVGNX set.",1454889600,,244,4.568181818181818
7454766,5,B016058RUI,Awesome compilation of J&MM episodes. A must have. Now I can't wait for a Board James Blu-Ray complete.,1454112000,,103,4.777777777777778
7454767,5,B016058RUI,"What a great Bluray!
I for one am a huge Cinemassacre fan and I love James and Mike Mondays!
This really is the best of the best, my emotions were everywhere on this one. One moment I'll be laughing and the next I'll be on the edge of my seat during some tense gameplay moments. When your watching these videos you can't help but feel like your hanging out with your buddies while reminiscing of better days. For me this was nostalgia withen nostalgia as I watched videos I haven't seen in years featuring video games that sent me even further back to when I was a kid.",1446854400,,569,4.277777777777778
7454768,4,B016058RUI,"If you like James and Mike Mondays it's hard to argue with the value this release offers. 7hrs and 15mins of content, plus an extra 45mins of exclusive material. It's hard to argue with how jam-packed they made this blu-ray, but it would've been nice if there was some behind the scenes stuff, or trailers for other Cinemassacre releases. It's a nice package though -- the menus are laid out clearly with information on the games and when the videos debuted, and the box art is appealing. But mostly it's just nice to have a whole lot of material on blu-ray. Here's hoping they follow this up with more releases in this format.",1446681600,2,627,4.557522123893805
7454769,5,B016058RUI,"For those not aware, ""James and Mike Mondays"" is a Youtube show by James Rolfe (a.k.a. the Angry Video Game Nerd) and his friend Mike Matei, where they do Let's Plays of several classic games.  Neither of them are playing characters here, they're both being themselves, simply having fun playing videogames and providing commentary, sometimes with the inclusion of extra friends or other Youtube celebrities, like JonTron.

If you're not familiar with Let's Plays, this might seem like a silly idea (like certain TV show host certainly got into fire for poorly expressing), after all, isn't the fun of a game in playing it?  Well, yes, but just like watching football or documentaries on TV, there's also a different kind of fun from watching others.  Plus, both these men are skilled entertainers, so they will properly provide entertaining commentary, jokes and all-around interesting facts and anecdotes related in one way or another to the games being played.  A lot of people think that just playing badly a game and screaming at the screen passes for entertainment.  These guys are not like that.

Plus, considering how many of those games are really, REALLY bad, it's definitely more fun watching someone else play than doing it yourself.  The downside to this release is, of course, that this content is available for free on Youtube.  The upside is that this is provided on a Blu-Ray, and so it comes with all the pros of the medium: no need for connection, no buffering issues, no downgrading video quality, no ads, no cuts between episode halves, etc.  An extra plus is that a few of these videos are actually not available to the public, so they're exclusive to this release.

With a runtime of about 8 hours, that's quite a lot of entertainment you get for the price.  Of course, if you've never seen their job, I'd recommend to watch a couple of episodes of their show on Youtube first.",1446508800,5,1900,4.812307692307693
7454770,5,B016058RUI,Well I have watched James and Mike Monday's every Monday since they started making them.  I'm glad they made a Blu-ray of the best ones.  The bonus content/ unseen episodes is worth the buy along with everything else of having a physical disc of James and Mike Monday's.,1446508800,,270,4.604166666666667
7454771,5,B016058RUI,Just as expected. Love the dvd,1446076800,,30,4.166666666666667

7454773,5,B016058RUI,"I support James Rolfe AKA The Angry Video Game Nerd in mostly everything he does. Sure is movie was alright & his recent reviews haven't been great but I still watch them. I'll admit I knew of James & Mike Monday's but never really watched any episode. This Blu-ray might set a record as one single disc holds an amazing 8 hours. You get your moneys worth, no matter what people say. I know physical media is dying but I prefer it over downloading or streaming. Anyways, this is a great set if you enjoy AVGN or if you like video games then I suggest you check this out along with Rolfe's other projects. I highly recommend it.",1445817600,7,627,4.322033898305085
7454774,1,B016058RUI,$25 to watch James and Mike be mediocre at old 16 and 8 bit games? This is cash-grabbing at its worst.,1445817600,12,102,3.9047619047619047
7454775,5,B016058RUI,"A good 7 hour compilation of some of the better James and Mike Monday episodes plus some bonus games only on the bluray. Decent presentation, the bluray menu isn't Inspector Gadget but it serves its purpose. Most of the complaints are that these episodes are free on YouTube. While that is true, most of these episodes are in multiple parts with ads. This bluray is for someone who wants to watch the episodes all the way through with no interruptions.  The price is hardly an issue aswell. Most 2 hour movies cost the same as this 7+ hour compilation.",1445644800,4,552,4.575757575757576
