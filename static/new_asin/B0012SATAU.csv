8247648,5,B0012SATAU,"One of my favorite movies! A platoon of modern soldiers suddenly find themselves in the middle of one of the biggest conflicts in Japanese samurai history. (Using ""samurai history"" as an easy way to describe the era.) Can they alter history? SHOULD they alter history? How effective are their modern weapons against a skilled, dedicated samurai army? It is total fantasy, as are all time-warp movies, but it is a fun ride for sure!",1519171200,,431,4.837837837837838

This film makes us discover that often the appearance is misleading and that obviousness can destroy illusion. To cross the time and to meet the man of honour is not an easy thing but declaring war to them, you will see who wins. If you like the samurai try this one.",1236729600,,484,6.82258064516129
