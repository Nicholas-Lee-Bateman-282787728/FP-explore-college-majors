6033297,5,B00FVW2QEK,"IDOW-HCE is a truly entertaining and extremely useful documentary. I have been into analog modular synths ever since they were just called ""synths"". I have also owned a few, including my ARP 2600 that I still use regularly. What I like most about this film is the way that they interweave history, personal stories and modern applications of the technology.

Legends like Moog and Buchla are of course mentioned, but other more obscure details of the origins of synthesis are investigated as well, filling in some very interesting areas. The relationships between music, entertainment, science and academia are also explored and shown for their symbiotic value.

Music legends, from Walter/Wendy Carlos to Keith Emerson to Vince Clarke to Trent Reznor and many more are discussed, making us realize the pervasive nature of the influence modular synthesis has had on classical, pop, dance and rock music, and on sound in general.

Another great aspect of the film is the insight of today's modern modular manufacturers, some of whom started out as hobbyists, and are now running corporations making the next generation of gear.

Hard Core Edition consists of 2 DVD's, probably about 4 hours of video altogether, but all of it engaging and interesting. I have watched it several times, in pieces and in long stretches, and I have learned new things, and discovered new manufacturers whose products I intend to sample and maybe even buy to add to my collection.

If you are interested in electronic music, and the how, the who and the why of it all, you will be hard pressed to find a better guide than I Dream of Wires: Hardcore Edition.",1396310400,5,1635,4.930909090909091
6033298,4,B00FVW2QEK,"If you love synths, IDOW is four hours of total modular fun.  I watched it over two days, just not to be overwhelmed, but what I saw was the best documentary exploration of electronic music to date.  Starting with the earliest attempts to create synthesizers in the first part of the 20th century, IDOW moves through the first bloom of modular synths in about 1965, when Norm Buchla in California, and Bob Moog in New York, developed workable voltage controlled synths.  Each had his voice; for Buchla it was Milton Subotnick's sonic exploration of the Buchla; for Moog Wendy Carlos's groundbreaking Switch-On Bach made Moog a household name.  Though IDOW gives short shrift to Carlos (why?), there is so much information that sheer weight moves you past. Detailing the rise and fall of the modular synthesizer, the first part ends in the rise of cheap digital synths.  As Trent Reznor says ""Suddenly there were synths at Guitar Center.""

The second part of the documentary looks into the boutique world of new modulars, exploring the difference between 5uu and Eurorack modulars, and looking at some manufacturers and designers. You will learn the difference between Through the card and printed-on circuits, and the future, a digital-analog hybrid.  Many of the synth users talk about how used VST's left them feeling uninspired, and by getting back to physical synths, their work improved.  But also IDOW exposes the inward spiral of gear for its own sake, and the unhappy realization that many who have modular setups don't produce any recorded work.  Like the bewildering world of guitar pedals, so now eurorack module makers produce must-have units for a small, but drooling audience.  But still, if you love synths as much as I do, there are far worse ways to spend 4 hours.  At the very least, IDOW left me with a new respect for Trent Renzor, someone whose work has never touched me before.",1392336000,,1899,4.903125
6033299,5,B00FVW2QEK,"A very detailed documentary about the ENTIRE history of keyboards, electronics in music, and synthesizers --mainly modular synthesizers. This isn't music genre specific, as a lot of history is covered. But, there are a lot of great interviews, clips, and pictures from many artists and sources.",1391472000,,294,5.413043478260869
6033300,5,B00FVW2QEK,"I Dream Of Wires: Hardcore Edition can be viewed as a 4 hour exploration of ""the rise, fall and rise again of modular synthesizers."" But it's really laid out as two separate documentaries. Part 1 covers the rise modular synthesizers in the 1960s through the 1970s, and their fall as more portable easy to understand music synthesizers became available in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. This part alone is worth the price of admission, it is an excellent and engaging look at the companies, personalities and passions that spurred the birth of an industry; that took music synthesis out of the rarified environments of academia and into the world of commercial pop culture. Interviews include people directly involved in the creation of these magical musical monster machines, as well as musicians from both academia (Morton Subotnick) and popular music (Gary Numan, Daniel Miller, Trent Reznor, etc.). This part of the film is of interest not just to modular synthesizer fans, but anyone at all interested in music history, music instrument design, or electronic music in any of its myriad styles.

Part 2 deals with the reemergence of modular synthesis and has a completely different feel and stylistic direction than the first, historical, part. It is expressed as a journey through the wild and wildly exploding (albeit boutique) modular synthesis world that exists today: a world populated by tiny one-person (or few-person) companies driven mainly by the love of their products rather than bottom line profits; do-it-yourselfers who build these exotic instruments for the sheer joy of expression and exploration; musicians and artists searching for a connection to the past, a more direct physical connection  to the music making process, or simply a new way of experiencing music; a world populated by an extremely diverse set of people, all turning to modular synthesizers for an equally diverse set of reasons. This is a documentary about vibrancy, diversity and potentiality. Interviews in this part continue to include famous personalities, but also branches out into the small but enthusiastic worldwide community of modular synthesizer manufacturers and users. This part of the documentary shows but a tip of the modular synth iceberg, but I think it documents well the state of the industry: untamed, fragmented, divergent, creative and expanding.

The production values throughout are excellent throughout. The soundtrack is awesome. The eye candy (for synth fans like me) is amazing. The content informative and entertaining.",1389916800,11,2550,5.32258064516129

The soundtrack is an excellent example of what these synths can do.  Lastly, if you're a fan of Morton Subotnick, he has more screen time than anybody.",1442534400,,325,4.890909090909091
6033304,2,B00FVW2QEK,"hey skipped over disco, post punk, new wave. But did mention that punk music temorarily set back synths.
How do you slip over those.genres?
It started out well enough.",1441497600,,167,4.793103448275862
6033305,3,B00FVW2QEK,"No new wave mention at all.  I dream of wires is of course a title to a Gary Numan song on the superb Telekon album, so why is he not mentioned as a God Father of synthesizers beats me.  This DVD shows a lot of nerds that love modular synths but don't really appreciate what synthesizers did for popular music.  Don't waste your money.  It is now available on NETFIX.",1440115200,,367,4.2
6033306,3,B00FVW2QEK,"As I post this review in August 2015 I see a lot of reviews posted in 2014 talking about a four hour film.
There must have been a longer version of this DVD (titled the HARD CORE EDITION)  but its reviews are combined by Amazon and listed under the First Run Features release in August 2015 which has the 96 minute film plus 4 bonus shorts, 3 music videos from Solvent and an extended interview with Trent Reznor. That is the one I received for review.

The film is about Electonic sounds and electronic music. Though the Moog synthesizer  used a lot in rock music  is mentioned and was the first unit for home use, the music here is that of Morton Subotnick and others who use sounds from oscillators to make music. I tried to like this  and I do like some synth music but this was way too technical for me, the average music fan. I know the tekkie folks will want this  and maybe the longer version  but for the average music fan I think it will be too technical and (at least for me) the soundtrack became annoying.

Im giving it three stars as to how it felt for me to watch it, but please  tekkie folks  don't beat on me. Im just trying to alert the non-tekkie person who listens to (and does not composer) electronic music.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6033307,5,B00FVW2QEK,"Yeah, love this film, but not sure it shows our ""hobby"" in a flattering way to outsiders!
a lot of the negative comments in the film about the new interest in modular synths seem unjust on first hearing but on reflection are very true.
a lot of the ""music"" in the film is awful and some of the performances are embarrassing and look like enactments of the emperors new clothes.
a lot of ridiculously expensive equipment (im looking at you serge!) being used to make unpleasant noise.
several statements about people who were making music, got a modular and were never heard from again, so true!
As pointed out by others, several strange omissions.
so strangely, a warts and all, often embarrassing look at the modular synth world, but also an entertaining celebration, i love it!",1419206400,,779,4.735294117647059

8618782,5,B00FVW2QEK,A great movie if you are already in or getting into eurorack. It explains the origin of these mysterious synths and how they came about to be. This is a documentary on the origin and not on how to use eurorack.,1526428800,,210,4.146341463414634

8618791,5,B00FVW2QEK,Superb documentary. People who claim that it glosses over certain social impacts of synthesizers (such as 70s disco) are missing the fact that this documentary is specifically about modular hardware synthesizers. I would argue that non-modular Moog synths were far more prevalent in such context. I thought this documentary did an excellent job of explaining the origins of modular synthesis and the impact they had on the industry as a whole. You also get a clear sense of how they sound when compared to soft synths of today.,1464912000,6,527,5.0
