When I met Jesus Christ in 1993, I accepted by faith that the Bible was the trustful and inerrant Word of God. However, being an Electronics Engineers since 1978, all the scientific formation I received was evolutionist. So for several years I had this conflict between my belief in what the Bible says about how the universe, Earth and man were created, and what I had studied and learned from the evolution theory (which frontally contradicts the Bible).
Well, when a friend borrowed this video series to me and I could watch this wonderful piece of work by Dr. A. E. Wilder-Smith, the false conflict between Cristian faith and science simply vanished away!
Despite being a Christian, in this masterpiece video series, the ex-atheist and ex-evolutionist author does not ""force"" any preconceived religious point of view or conclusion, but simply presents strong scientific evidences and arguments to let the audience get to his own decision about this critical question: ""Which Origins Model do the scientific evidences support: the Creationist model or the Evolutionist model?"".
Highly recommended for people who like to learn and think, and that are not philosophically committed beforehand not to believe in a Creator.",1439078400,,1292,5.1571428571428575
