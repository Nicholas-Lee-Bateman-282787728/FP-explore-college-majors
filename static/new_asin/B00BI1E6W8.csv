8568801,5,B00BI1E6W8,"This is a beautifully photographed and accurate documentary movie on the Whitetail Deer! I regard it as a milestone in non-hunting oriented and natural resources movie with a great message and very much worth owning! I have been a fish and wildlife biologist for many years and own 900 acres of land in two separate locations, which to pay the taxes(!!!) and manage as a farm is quite difficult. Every conclusion, segment of the movie is outstanding. Now I need to own the Elk in North America DVD. One word of caution though.....I wanted the DVD not the download....",1480896000,,567,4.737373737373737
