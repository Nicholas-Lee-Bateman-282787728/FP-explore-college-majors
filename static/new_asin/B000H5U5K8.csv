There are a few water-saving tips, but I could have just as easily gotten the same info (and more interestingly presented) on youtube. I'd hoped for a little more background on WHY we need to conserve water (some history/stats, please?). Not an in-depth treatment. I should return this.",1364947200,,398,5.234375
8136546,5,B000H5U5K8,"I ordered this DVD to help my 6-year-old son research water conservation for a recent school project, and I was very pleased with it.  The problem (several threats to our future drinking water supply) is clearly explained, facts and details are given, the documentary footage is interesting and kept my son's attention (as well as mine), and solutions are suggested that can be implemented at home.  I learned several new things myself (such as how phosphorus impacts water, I was vaguely aware that it might be bad but never knew why), and I think the film has made our whole family more aware of our actions.  I have tried to make my kids aware of nature and the environment as early as they could understand, and this film helped me pick up where books like ""The Lorax"" (which we love) leaves off.  The film presents a serious problem, but it does so in a way that leaves you with a sense of your power to make a difference for good.  I will be looking into other films in the series.",1330646400,,987,4.461111111111111
