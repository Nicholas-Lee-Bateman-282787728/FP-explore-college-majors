8228229,5,B000XFVIOE,"Why do we like Clifford? Because it's clean, it's relatively free from sarcasm, cruelty is not on display as a virtue for emulation by impressionable toddlers, no one is half-naked, there's no cursing.... I could go on. What we especially like about the individual Clifford DVDs though, is that they never repeat an episode on one that they have on another. Not even the big Clifford ""box set"" or whatever it is, that we also own, has any repeats of whats on the individual DVDs, so you can buy a DVD without worrying that you're wasting your money on episodes you already own. This is assuming you're buying more than one Clifford DVD, which you will if your child gets as addicted as ours has.
The stories on this DVD are: Tummy Trouble * Cleo Gets a Cone * Tie-Dyed Clifford * Team Spirit * Follow the Leader * Topsy Turvy Day * That's Snow Lie * Led Astray * Stars In Your Eyes * Fair Weather Friend.",1231459200,8,904,4.386904761904762
8228230,5,B000XFVIOE,"It's been a little while since there's been a ""Clifford the Big Red Dog"" DVD release, so this DVD is quite welcome. Lionsgate has delivered by bringing us a DVD packed with ten stories from the show, for a total over 100 minutes of fun. Also included on this DVD are a few ""Speckle Stories"" (fun animated interstitial segments that aired in between stories on the television broadcasts.) There's also the feature ""Real Life Doggy Friends."" This is a feature many may not have seen. It was developed for the program, but was removed in many markets due to complaints by parents that it would cause kids to beg their parents to get them dogs. Well -- maybe so, but all in all, these spots are good canine fun.

Unfortunately, with the passing of John Ritter, it looks like this series has come to an end. On the bright side, you can relive the magic of the show with some of the great stories included on this DVD. One of the fun stories on this disc is ""Tie-Dyed Clifford,"" in which Cleo, T-Bone and Clifford mistake a set of tie-dye paints for shampoos, leading to a colorful new look for Clifford. Another is ""Led Astray,"" featuring a delightful guest spot by Henry Winkler as the voice of the mischievous dog Artie. Henry Winkler would go on to perform the voice of the bird Norville on the series ""Clifford's Puppy Days.""

The other stories on this DVD are as follows -- ""Tummy Trouble, ""Cleo Gets a Cone,"" ""Team Spirit,"" ""Follow the Leader,"" ""Topsy-Turvy Day,"" ""That's Snow Lie,"" ""Stars in Your Eyes"" and ""Fair Weather Friend."" All are a delight to watch, for any fan of this lovable big red dog and his friends.",1207785600,3,1616,4.530821917808219
