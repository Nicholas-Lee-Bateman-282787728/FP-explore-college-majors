8652663,4,B00JOW73IC,This was so cute. The ferret stole the show. A little bummed that I didn't realize it was only 12 minutes long when I purchased it as a gift for our daughter that has ferrets. The price is a little steep for a 12 minute video.,1451174400,,226,3.9347826086956523
8652664,5,B00JOW73IC,"An adorable movie for the entire family. Jacob Tremblay is adorable as ""Sam"", a young orphan who is hoping to find a home with new parents...enter Fred Ewanuick and Lisa Durupt.  Once they meet Sam and his ferret, ""Booger"" (played by Falcor the Ferret), it's a question of whether they will adopt the young pair...Beverley Elliott is delightful as the one who helps Sam put Booger's magic to work.  A true delight for all ages...and a film that shows the wonder of ferrets.",1412553600,,473,4.686746987951807
8652665,5,B00JOW73IC,"A delightful fun movie for children of ALL ages. A loving ferret and his friend, a little orphan boy through magic (and some ferret silliness) shows why they both deserve a forever home. A lighthearted fun movie to watch over and over. Now how did he do that trick, again? ;-P",1399939200,,276,4.431372549019608
8652666,5,B00JOW73IC,"I purchased this movie a while back and live in UK. This short ticks so many boxes for me. It highlights dealing with bereavement, bullying, family, pets and love. The acting from the young lad with the ferret was just amazing. I would highly recommend this movie.",1398729600,,264,4.638297872340425
8652667,5,B00JOW73IC,"Such a cute movie and great for kids. I am just disappointed it wasn't longer because my husband and I were enjoying it so much!
Absolutely fantastic movie for kids, and really paints ferrets in the positive light that they deserve :)",1398643200,,234,4.595238095238095
8652668,5,B00JOW73IC,"Sam (Jacob Tremblay) and his ferret, Booger (Falcor the Ferret) are looking for a forever home. This movie is short, but sweet.
Both Sam and Booger will steal your heart. From Alison Parker, the director of Jake and Jasper: A Ferret Tale, this is Falcor's second short film outing. Submitted to (and accepted by) many film festivals, this is a well-crafted, heartwarming tale.

Maybe one day we will get to find out more about Sam and Booger?

Well worth a look.",1398643200,,462,4.691358024691358
8652669,5,B00JOW73IC,"I am more of a horror person, but I absolutely love this movie. I think it is great that  there is finally a movie around which shows ferrets in a good light. Can't wait for the next ferretastic film from director Alison Parker and Falcor",1398643200,,238,4.288888888888889
8652670,5,B00JOW73IC,Really enjoyable movie for adults and children!  Great story and really cute ferret....well done for the short time.  Just wish it was longer!,1398384000,,142,5.130434782608695
