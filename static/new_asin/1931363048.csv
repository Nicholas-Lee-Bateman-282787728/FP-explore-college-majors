Christophe Clugston is a genius in the field of self-defence.  He is the Mozart of self-protection.  Buy it, or risk getting killed.",1026950400,5,356,5.0
203026,4,1931363048,"This is an excellent tape as long as you have already reviewed Combat JKD. While it is not entirely essential that you have them it helps, and if you're really concerned about your safety it is a small price.",1000684800,5,208,4.358974358974359
7801472,5,1931363048,"Don't understand the negative criticism. First offs this instructional video isn't meant for professional fighters or athletes. It's primarily designed for ordinary people who go about their every day routine and may not be in the prime shape of their lives. It's rooted in body mechanics and brilliantly illustrated by Chris. Self defense is simpler to learn than combat sports that require years. So stop having impractical and unreasonable expectations.

7801473,5,1931363048,"While it is a number of years old it teaches super simple ways to beat attackers and defend yourself from a multitude of attacks.  I have studied many martial arts for 10 years and you will find few, if any, that can compete with Chris's knowledge. Fantastic.",1391212800,,259,4.51063829787234
7801474,1,1931363048,"I bought this used from a guy with a large collection. I see now why he was letting this program go inexpensively.  I wish I saved my money toward something better. My daughters have learned more in girlscouts about locks and escapes. Oh boy, does he know that was his head being used as the battering ram? This could be a parity piece for humor, maybe that was the intent?",1232582400,2,373,4.328571428571428
7801475,2,1931363048,Hi my name is Mike Sanlin and i taught chris clugston a system i invented called combat jkd. He put it out on video which i approved of but then he later came out with a video called comhrac bas. Ever since he did that i have not spoken to him. Its the worst thing ever he teaches some of my moves like the pop up and the wedge but then he does some stupid moves like the tossed salad i eman you have got to be kidding me. He was an ok student but wasn't anything special. Comhrac bas is not what it claims to be. It will get you killed. I feel sorry for hi i don't know why he left a great system like combat jkd for some stupid fake historical grabeg like comhrac bas. My opinion is don't buy it its rubbish if yu wnat something fromm clugston get the combat jkd tape as he teaches my stuff thats why. Don't wasste your money.,1133654400,13,828,3.9345238095238093
7801476,1,1931363048,"My name is Dale Apollo Cook. I've been teaching Martial Arts for over 30 years. If you have ever seen the Rickson Gracie movie 'Choke' you will know who I am. Chris Clugston first came to me when he was 16 years old. He studied under me until he was 21. He was an ok Student but nothing exceptional.

Somehow this guy gets the nerve to tell other people that he was a black belt under me. Like I have previously stated, yes he was my student but nothing great. I have viewed his material and it is a waste of money. I am convinced he made up over half of the moves and the rest are moves that I taught him, which he then tagged his pretty 'Comrac Bas' name with.

7801477,5,1931363048,"Some of the reviews are so focused on the whole ""Gladiator Stuff (Italian)"" or ""Comhrac Bas (Celtic)"" issue that they missed the content.  What Clugston is trying to show is the European fighting tradition and why you never hear about it.  Many people feel only fighting traditions from Asia matter and get caught up in a lot of religion and mystism.  Competitions like the UFC have clearly shown the weak points of several forms of martial arts.  The UFC also can't be confused with real life and death combat either.  What he is trying to express is, for instance, the Romans must have knew a thing or two about fighting.  They conquered most of the known world at the time.  Obviously they had some techniques that worked.  And the Galdiators who fought for survival in most cases, weeded out what worked and didn't work.  Sure he incorporates some fighting ideas from many areas and from his own experience, but isn't that the point.  Focusing on the fact that he calls his system ""Comhrac Bas"" which if you listen to the tape he explains and not on the content shows maybe you did waste your money, because you are just not getting it.  If you have an opinion about the techniques or philosophy then comment on that not semantics issues, etc.  It is also important to point out that many of these techniques need to actually be performed in order to understand them.  Many don't look pretty or flashy, but are structured a certain way for good reason.  Just watching will not allow you to completely understand and neither will watching without paying attention to the fine points and Clugston's commentary.",1093651200,6,1612,4.710714285714285
7801478,2,1931363048,"Some good stuff but, where is the basis for saying that these techniques come from Gladiator days???  What do cape buffalos (in South Africa) have to do with Roman Gladiators??? Why is the system called Comrac Bas (Keltic) and not Gladiator Stuff (Italian)???  As for the techniques demonstated, they are ok, but there is no cohesiveness.  I would not particularly recommend these to anyone, they should spend their money elsewhere.",1031702400,8,432,5.142857142857143
7801479,5,1931363048,"Christophe Clugston looks like a man with something to say.  I decided to listen.  Interested, I ordered the ROSETTA STONE tape in November of 2001.  When it arrived I was elated.  Then I was astonished, fascinated, and enlightened.  This is razor-edge technology, training and fighting philosophy that takes real fighting to an unparalleled level.  I was so impressed by this ROSETTA STONE that I had to have the series of tapes that preceded it.  I ordered and purchased the COMBAT JKD #1 and #2, with the knife-fighting bonus.  Also I purchased the COMHRAC BAS #1 and #2 and the SAVAGE STREETFIGHTING SERIES #1, #2 and #3.  I have not been disappointed.
  The information on these tapes can and does shatter popular misconceptions about certain techniques and how and why, and just as importantly when to use them, if at all.  COMHRAC BAS does not use other system movements.  Different angles.  Different presentations.  No guesswork here.  Geometry and physics.  These are refined and also original techniques that you might think that you've seen somewhere else.  You haven't.  The uninitiated don't see or understand the variation.  Christophe will demonstrate and clarify the variation.  Your eyes will be opened.  There is an exclusivity of superior concepts here, all of them viable.
  COMHRAC BAS is not high-flying, silk jammies, film-at-eleven, dragon's breath nonsense.  It is (in my words) a configuration of arcane fragments of proven life-or-death battlecraft, collated through the applied science of modern combat technology.  Exanimate because it was unnamed, this battlecraft has been retrieved and properly directed, which clearly predisposes it to the grammar of this system.  COMHRAC BAS is structured as a language: the language of fighting.  This is an engineered system governed by an offensive fighter's mindset.  Master Clugston will groom you into that mindset by teaching you the appropriate skills.  The complexity is in the science.  That has been done for you.  This is easy stuff to learn.  You don't have to know how a television set works to turn one on and watch it.  COMHRAC BAS is not martial art or sport fighting.  It's not voodoo and it's not parlour tricks.  It is ferocious.  It is undiluted nasty.  COMHRAC BAS is stark reality and it will be a grim dose of reality for anyone stupid enough to challenge it.  No tapping out.  No saved by the bell.  No calendar girls.
  The winner survives.  The loser is no longer a problem.
  COMHRAC BAS is studied and learned in motion.  Master Clugston has proven that this is the only way to experience or analyse techniques.  Time allows nothing else.  If you want to study stop motion animation, don't study fighting; grab a copy of Gumby and Pokey instead.
  Christophe Clugston is a man of vision and a remarkable teacher.  How rare!  How refreshing!  Listen carefully to exactly all of what the man says.  What he says is important; it's crucial.  He speaks from experience that comes from actually doing it.  He says and shows exactly what you need to know.  Become fluent in COMHRAC BAS and become safe on the street where fighting is terribly real.
  Buy and study these tapes.
  Enjoy and learn from these tapes.",1031356800,4,3205,4.96584440227704
7801480,5,1931363048,"The saga continues as Chris brings you more insight into his world of no nonsense self preservation.  If you read my other review you already know my background as I sang praises for his first series of tapes entitled COMBAT JKD.  Most of the time, under pressure just to produce another product, sequels have no real value and actually detract from the credibility of the orginal.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE! Chris continues to take you on a journey to becoming the most complete fighting machine you are capable of being and believe me you have no idea how far your capabilities can take you until you walk down Chris' road.
Also at this time let me tell you something that I should have expounded on in the first video.  Chris' knife fighting system that is explained as a bonus in the first video will completely turn around anything you think you know about this lost art.  A great deal of our time, while I was in group, was spent learning knife fighting techniques.  I wish we would have had Chris at Fort Bragg and at JKF Special Warfare Center because he could have taught us all a thing or two or ten.  If you are interested even in the least of becoming skilled in this lost art don't go to any other source but Chris on this one.  He's got it down.
Anyway by now you probably realise I am quite a fan of his methods and techniques and are probably wondering if we are related or something.  I can assure you I have never met him but a long time ago I learned that when you quit learning and think you know it all you're just backing up and in this game and on this field if you are backing up it will be into a 6 X 3 ft. hole.
In closing, if you can be fortunate enough to own all five of Chris' videos, then you are ready for ANYTHING-ANYTIME-ANYPLACE...",1030838400,8,1767,4.250746268656717
7801481,5,1931363048,"Pick any of Clugston's tapes and you will not miss... they give you street 'tools' that work and that have been real-world tested. Clugston provides some of the most effective material, combined with a unique teaching approach that is unsurpassed.
