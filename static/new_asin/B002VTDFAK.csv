4001602,5,B002VTDFAK,"I love this DVD. I could go on and on about this DVD and how great the footage is but time limits me. The only complaint I have is the Millennium Force video because I don't think its theirs. Manta, Diamondback, and Expedition Ge Force is my favorites to watch! Keep up the Great work guys!!!",1261526400,4,292,4.232142857142857
4001603,4,B002VTDFAK,"I'm giving this DVD to my husband as a Christmas present but had to preview it first to make sure it worked properly ; )

Very good quality video and point of view shots.  I may never make it to some of the countries included on this DVD but I can experience the next best thing and feel like I'm riding in the front seat of each of these coasters (which happens to be my favorite seat riding new coasters for the first time anyway).  The point of view shots are so good I felt a little dizzy going down the first drop on Millennium Force.

Gorgeous footage, no silly fluff, just exciting rides from a true Coaster lover.  Wheeeeeeeeee.",1260576000,,636,4.266666666666667
4001604,5,B002VTDFAK,"I had pre ordered this dvd even before it was available. That's because I knew the high quality of this series of dvds. I just love the ""raw"" element where you get to listen to the original sounds the coasters make and all the screaming of people. Feels like I'm in the theme park too! Also, the coasters in volume 4 are awesome and I couldn't miss that one. It's really entertaining and I highly suggest it to anyone who loves roller coasters.  Thank you Rob and Elissa for another amazing work there..

4001605,5,B002VTDFAK,"If you want the best HD footage of some great coasters that you can't get anywhere else than this is the DVD for you. This footage is amazingly spectacular and not even the Discovery Channel or Travel Channel can get footage this good (unless it is footage from Theme Park Review)

This is one entertaining DVD and some of the coasters found in this collection are crazy and will make any coaster enthusiasts watch it on the edge of their seats.

Great Job !",1258243200,9,458,4.440476190476191
8382528,5,B002VTDFAK,I bought these as a gift and they did not disappoint! They arrived earlier than expected and in perfect condition. My recipient couldn't be happier as the few DVDs I purchased for him has completed his collection.,1420848000,,213,4.783783783783784
8382529,3,B002VTDFAK,Not enough feeling like I was actually on the roller coaster.  That was my reason for purchasing the video.- kinda dull!!!,1408406400,,122,4.809523809523809
8382530,3,B002VTDFAK,Not really as scary as I thought it could have been and that is on a projector screen. Bad sound?,1396396800,,97,3.9
8382531,5,B002VTDFAK,I loved this dvd.  It was really fun watching it with family members that enjoy coasters as much as I do. Would purchase again.,1369958400,,127,4.291666666666667
8382532,4,B002VTDFAK,"I got the Rollercoasters in the raw DVD 4 becuase i just love rollercoasters and Rob Alveys Videos are good.

A few Problems:
1: DVD holder Broken, wich means dvd will slide around
2: DVD promisses Front Row POV, some coasters he shows doesnt have POV's
3: some coasters are shown more than others

Other than that great footage, cant wait to see more.",1345507200,,352,4.484375
8382533,5,B002VTDFAK,Robb Alevy continues this entertaining series with more amzing footage.  He is truly a professional when it comes to delivering the goods.,1342051200,,138,5.2727272727272725
8382534,5,B002VTDFAK,I *love* this DVD!  You won't find better footage out there of coasters from all over the world.  Not only is this professionally filmed and edited.. it's also crazy fun to watch!  I'm really impressed by how well this was put together.  I can't wait to watch it again and again... thanks Theme Park Review!!!,1341878400,,309,4.5636363636363635
8382535,5,B002VTDFAK,"Well done for a HD point-of-view video. The actual coasters were pretty eclectic, some foriegn. I would not mind 'the best of current American coasters' in the future.",1317254400,,167,5.0
8382536,5,B002VTDFAK,"My complaint with most of the other roller coaster videos that have ever been issued: too much talking, not enough on-board footage.  While even this series is not quite perfect, it is much better than any of the previous efforts.  Hopefully the producers will do many more in the future.",1268352000,2,288,4.74
8382537,4,B002VTDFAK,"For those of us who love roller coasters and cannot always be riding one (how about one in the backyard?), the second best thing to being there is playing the DVD version on a big screen TV.  Roller Coasters in the Raw puts you in the front seat, and it is realistic enough that I actually can get a bit queasy from watching too many at once.  I appreciate the fact that there is no commentary, although I found it a bit annoying that on one ride I could hear in the back ground someone encouraging people on the ride to scream for the recording.  I would think ""in the raw"" would include no fake screaming.  One of reasons I purchased this particular DVD was the inclusion of Millenium Force at Cedar Point, which I had the privilege of riding this past October no less than 5 times, two in daylight, one at twilight and two at night.  To me that is the ultimate full coaster (Top Thrill Dragster, also at Cedar Point, is faster and higher, but the dang thing only lasts 17 seconds), and this DVD does a good job of capturing the ride.  Also it does a great job with Maverick at Cedar Point.

My only complaint is the choice of some of the coasters included, especially one that has a top speed of 25 mph (how big a thrill can it be, really?).  However, it is intereting to see some of the European coasters that I probably would never have occasion to ride, but what about the truly amazing ones in Asia?  I hope the next edition will include some of those.",1262476800,2,1459,4.257246376811594
