8573620,5,B00BTGMF1G,"A movie about the mid 1970s (1975-1976), right when the Communist revolution was coming to an end when Mao, the communist leader dies.  A man narrates his life as a young boy, and his family, growing up in communist China at a time when people are tracked down if they are anti-government and executions are conducted in public.  This boy living in such an environment meets a young man by accident who was being chased by the communist red army.  The movie has a bit of a mystery about this young man until the very end.

Throughout the movie, it seemed that the story is about how poor this little boy is that what everyone values is the boy's new white shirt.  The focus was so much about a shirt that everyone gets into fights and arguments about it. At first, one would find it strange in today's standards to fight over a shirt, but if one thinks about it, when how many outfits you can have as a family is limited in your lifetime by the communist, a shirt can be of great value as much as food and shelter.  This film does a great job at juxtaposing the value of this shirt with the situations that surrounds the boy that it creates a very valuable meaning out of a shirt at the end of the movie.  The story is very artistically done and intelligently told.  The runaway young man, though only shows up for a short period in the movie, creates a sympathy from the viewer based on stories told about him by all the characters and the actions he took all the way to the very end.

Movie is in Mandarin (Chinese) and you must turn on the English subtitle via your functions.",1486425600,,1579,4.3074324324324325

8573624,4,B00BTGMF1G,"A tragic story from the times of China's cultural revolution. There were a few minor flaws in the construction of the movie, and the boy protagonist was not as good an actor as Chinese children, with inspired direction, often are. Nevertheless, the storyline kept me riveted to the end. The major characters are fairly complex. Behind anger there is love, behind seeming indifference and cruelty there is empathy and compassion. Definitely worth seeing. 4 1/4 stars.",1481673600,,466,5.144736842105263

8573626,4,B00BTGMF1G,"Low budget, but high quality. A portrayal of life in rural china during the oppressive period before Mao's death. The movie focuses on the relationship between Chine's intellectuals and the State, with an in-depth encounter of the classic Chinese family life during that time. I totally recommend this, if you may forgive it's cinematographic faults. A beautiful movie. I hope you enjoy this rare movie as much as I did.",1448323200,3,420,5.014285714285714
