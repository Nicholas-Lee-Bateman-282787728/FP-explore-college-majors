7987312,4,B00008VKMU,"A rare opportunity to see Otsuka Sensei.
Gives the viewer (especially if they are a practitioner) an amazing connectedness to Wado.

7987313,3,B00008VKMU,"there was good footage of Ohtsuka but the end was garbage, with filler material from some unrealted tournament fighting. not very clear images overall. showed Suzuki in one kata I believe. they should have focused on Ohtsuka and Suzuki, then this would have been first rate DVD.",1362268800,,278,4.9361702127659575

7987315,1,B00008VKMU,"If you want to see really high quality footage of the Founder of Wado Ryu Karate performins kata that was filmed by Berkley University (California) in 1965 see Wado Ryu The Way of Peace and Harmony Volumes 1 & 2. Unlike the above, they are professionally produced films from a Southern Californian studio, that you will be proud to own.",1131235200,6,336,4.616666666666666
7987316,4,B00008VKMU,"Just watched it for the first time and WOW! What can I say, except, I really
learned a lot from this DVD. It showed me how to perform every kata exactly
how it should be done.",1089158400,,175,3.888888888888889
7987317,1,B00008VKMU,"Unfortunately this DVD is just a rip off.
The video was recorded from VHS tape & poorly formatted.
There are no chapters or any other features that you would expect from a DVD.
 I was hoping to supplement my Wado Ryu training with the aid of the examples on this DVD, but there is absolutely nothing to gain from this piece of junk!
 For a great series on Wado Ryu that shows the katas in detail, I highly recommend David Deaton's ""Wado Ryu Karate"" series produced by Panther Productions.",1078185600,3,488,4.47191011235955
7987318,1,B00008VKMU,"More like negative stars.  This DVD is non-Functional. It only plays 10min at a time.  The quality of footage is very low.  If I could watch the footage of Otsuka Sensei, it would be worth it, but I cannot.  The audio commentary is silly.  For any who has trained with Suzuki Sensei, or in Japanese karate would know that the terms that the commentators use are incorrect.  The most frustrating thing is that even when the DVD was sent back for a better copy it came back with the same errors in playability.  I am surprised that Amazon would sell such an untested product.  My suggestion is to not buy anything from yamazato-video.  It seems that most of their products are unsatisfactory.",1056844800,8,690,4.590163934426229
