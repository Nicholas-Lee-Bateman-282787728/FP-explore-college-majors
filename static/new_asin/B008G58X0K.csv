Devil Girl from Mars:  Nyah, a female alien commander from Mars, dressed in black vinyl, is heading for London. She is part of the advanced alien team that is looking for Earth men to replace the dying male population on her world. Because of damage to her flying saucer, caused by entering Earth's atmosphere, she is forced to land her ship in the remote Scottish moors. She is armed with a ray gun that can paralyze or kill, and she also has a tall, menacing robot.

On Nyah's world, the emancipation of the women eventually led to open warfare between the sexes. The females won, usurping the political power of the men. This eventually lead to the sexual impotence of the planet's entire male population; a rapid decline in the birthrate soon followed. The aliens possess an organic, self-regenerating technology, which was used to construct Nyah's spacecraft. Against this technology, human weaponry proves ineffectual, as demonstrated when Nyah comes away unscathed by gunshots from a pistol. The alien technology is unreliable, however, and Nyah's people have not been able to use it to artificially produce new offspring.

N'yah occasionally enters, makes threats, then leaves so the residents can contemplate her words. Intermixed with the Nyah story are a pair of romantic sub-plots that unfold in the film. In the first a fashion model, Miss Prestwick (Court), fled to this remote country inn in order to escape a married reporter, Michael Carter (McDermott), with whom she had an affair. Michael doggedly follows her, hoping to rekindle their romance. Meanwhile, a convict, Robert Justin, alias Albert Simpson (Reynolds), who accidentally killed his wife, has managed to escape from a prison in Stirlingshire and has come to the inn, hoping to connect with the barmaid, Doris (Corri) whom he truly loves.

A truly unique and unusual film you won't want to miss! It is truly a classic and a great watch!!!!!!

It turns out the aliens want Earth women for breeding purposes...And just see what happens next...... You won't be disappointed!!!",1385424000,,2575,5.087677725118484
