2347875,5,B000A0GP2W,"Here, we have the final set of R&S that covers the second half of the fourth season and the entire fifth season. The show's plug was pulled in 1995 during the fourth season, and its final run didn't manage to air until towards the end of 1996. The show never managed to end on a good note, either.

Games' second half of R&S's history was pretty much non-desireable episodes made just to keep the Nick execs happy. Not only that, its popularity was already plummeted to a mininum so small that it felt like the cat and dog duo were already forgotten. Hardcore fans would rather enjoy those early days with creator John Kricfalusi at the helm, but to them the Games history was an awful chore to watch.

However, John K. would recieve a glorious offer in 2002 by SpikeTV to come back at the helm of Ren and Stimpy with no argument or censorship whatsoever. So in 2003, new episodes were aired especially for those adult fans of the show. In fact, the words Adult Party Cartoon were added at the title screen; the original show wasn't designed for kids in the first place, so why do they even bother?

Unfortunately, only three of the nine half-hour episodes aired; the last six were pushed back on a Summer 2004 date, but never aired due to complaints on extremely risque content in one of the episodes by advertising companies, and eventually the show vanished.

History had repeated itself during Spike's history, and John K. is already fed up with TV. Then, he looked at other shows's histories-most notably from Family Guy's history-into how they recieve fans on TV and a hell of a lot more fans just by selling seasonal/chronological DVD sets and is convinced that DVD has no disregard nor restriction whatsoever.

In conclusion, John K. is producing and releasing these Games DVDs so that not only will he be able to release the Spike episodes on DVD, but will also be able to make Direct-to-DVD episodes. Now when it comes to releasing a set of non-desireable episodes, there's only one thing that counts: extras. This set will include commentaries by John K. and not only his original Spumco crew, but also a couple Games artists as well. That's right-according to an online chat at motlos.com, John K. has invited two of Games's background painters Scott Willis and Bill Wray (who also directed a few Games episodes at the time)to do commentaries and asks the two some serious questions on the episodes, as well as what it was like working at Games Animation. I don't know how many they will be doing for this set, but I hope it's a large number...

Buy this set while you can. If this and the other two R&S releases don't sell well, the cat & dog would probably be lost.

2347943,5,B000A0GP2W,"The final 17 shows of Ren and Stimpy, their original series, are all here in this 3-disc set, containing seasons 4B and 5! It includes a bunch of celebrity guest voices, including the late Phil Hartman and ""Stinky Weaselteats"" as himself, a caricature of Burl Ives! You never know what Ren and Stimpy will do next, in any of the sets, even here! It even has the final episode, which was banned from Nick and only aired on MTV in 1996; Sammy and Me & The Last Temptation! There's a whomping 13 commentaries, with a bit of language for most of them, even an uncensored ""F-bomb"", hence these sets' disclaimers, by the Spumco and Games Animation teams in this set, plus one by Ren and Stimpy, and a hidden extra commentary (as an Easter egg in disc 2's commentaries menu) by them and George Liquor (American), which only lasts about 4-and-a-half minutes for reasons unknown. Aside from commercials from disc 1, these are the only bonuses in this set, but it's a little more than what Seasons 3 and 4A had! Being a family-oriented toon expert, this set here is where I draw the line, as my research on the adults-only spin-off of Ren and Stimpy from Wikipedia and YouTube, and even here on Amazon, proves it's too gross, grotesque, risqu, extreme, awful, and tasteless for my good tastes in good toons from any era. It even had one show that was too extreme, even for Spike TV! It's THAT repulsive, the ""sick little monkeys""! It's a lucky thing Billy West turned that down, and so am I; to quote Mr. Horse, ""No, sir, I don't like it."" I'm happy just to finally have all 53 shows of the original series, even in spite of edited Spike and Nick prints for most of them, including the only tame pair of episodes from the spin-off; Man's Best Friend, the banned episode, and the uncut version of Big House Blues, the whole thing's theatrical pilot episode. Don't let me stop you from doing what you'd like to do with the adults-only spin-off series' DVD set; to each his own, and everyone has their own opinions about anything, even high-functioning-Autistic folk like me; that means I'm able to think for myself and have my own opinions about anything at all.

A show that peaked during the gross days of Nickelodeon; felt that me at 10 didn't fully appreciate the experience. I was right! Some amazing animations and art direction in this show and for the first time ever I have been watching the audio commentaries of the episodes. Some funny behind the scenes stories with the series creators are told and also some executive overrules that don't make a lot of sense. ""Don't Whiz On The Electric Fence"" was originally titled ""Don't Pee On The Electric Fence."" Some of the DVDs have Unrated versions that were toned down for TV. Kind of funny this was all from the minds of some twisted individuals that came together and were passionate about the project.

Then watch this garbage and be amazed at what unencumbered artists are capable of and what animation can devolve into without proper love of the art.",1434326400,2,439,4.3580246913580245
2347969,5,B000A0GP2W,"I must say, Games Animation and the later seasons of the Ren and Stimpy Show has been talked about (in a bad way) many, many times, but let me say this. I believe many people talk too bad about it, because I personaly found VERY many episodes on this DVD to be quite entertaining. I know there are some VERY bad episodes, but some rather funny as well. Also, there are many episodes that are funny according to your perspective. For example, Disc 1 includes some good and some not so good, depending on what you like. The first 2 episodes on this disc are Double Header and Scottsman in Space. I personaly see these episodes as homages to the Spumco days (of course I can see why a Spumco Ren and Stimpy fan would believe that Games is relying on Spumco to make good episodes), as Double Header includes a scene where Ren is thinking of all the bad Stimpy has done by remembering moments from past Spumco episodes including, Son of Stimpy, Stimpy's Invention, Ren's Bitter Half (which is actually a Games episode), A Visit to Anthony, and even Sven Hoek. Scottsman in Space is about Commander Hoek and Cadet Stimpy meeting Haggis Mac Haggis, and catching Space Maddness. Pixie King, Aloha Hoek, Cheese Rush days, and Galoot Wranglers are funny episodes, but are however quite gross too with showing earwax, poop, dead whale intestines, galoots, and more gross things. Also a spoiler alert: Wilbur cobb dies in Galoot Wranglers and doesn't appear again until the last episode where he is in heaven. However this disc also includes some AMAZING episodes such as, Weiner Barons, Insomniac Ren, My Shiny Friend, and my favorite season 4 episode, Ren Needs Help, which also has Spumco edition on the Lost Episodes DVD. On disc 2 there are two AMAZING and hilarious episodes called Space Dogged which is about our heros as Russian astronauts, and Feud for Sale, which is about 'That Man' trying to sell stuff to  Abner and Ewalt. All the episodes on this Disc, Ol' Blue Nose, Stupid Sidekick Union, Superstitious Stimpy, Travelogue, Hair of the Cat, City Hicks, Stimpy's pet, Ren's Brain, Bellhops, and Dog Tags are all good episodes but they are not as great as the others. The third disc however, is worth it. This disc includes some of the best games episodes, and my favorites (besides Spumco of course), such as, School Mates, Dinner Party, Terminal Stimpy, Reverend Jack Cheese, A Scooter for Yaksmas, Sammy and Me, and The Last Temptation of Ren. The other episodes, I was a Teenage Stimpy, Who's Stupid Now, Pen Pals, and Big Flakes are all funny, but they aren't as great. All in all, I say this boxset is worth it. Even though it doesn't have Wilderness Adventure. So, what are you waiting for? Join Commander Hoek and Cadet Stimpy on more Space adventures, help Reverend Jack Cheese spread the gospel of meat, and join our heros on even more demented adventures!

This is nothing like the orignal episodes. Scenes cropped then cut and left laying on some editors floor somewhere.

Once more its closed captioned (I'm deaf) nobody close captions DVD anymore due to the popularity of SUBTITLES. Subtitles are easier and cheaper to produce on a CD rather than CC encoding. So lame. But then again seeing as the product is made in mexico this doesn't surprize me. 99% of all the DVD I see come out of mexico are of such sub standard quality that you'd think they made DVD's out of old garbage can lids down there.

In as much as I really like thr antics of Ren and Stimpy I just cannot justify paying for the LIE that this product is. UNCUT? HARDLY!

THEY DID MAJOR SURGERY ON REN AND STIMPY.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON SUB STANDARD PRODUCT

2348055,2,B000A0GP2W,"In 1991, John Kricfalusi created The Ren and Stimpy Show. A cartoon that broke through the boundaries, shaking the animation industry like an earthquake, exploding onto the screen. He broke all previous rules that no other animator would of dared to try, and absolutely ran riot in art and story terms, creating one of the most, if not the most, subversive cartoon show of all time.

His work on the first two seasons gave him two Emmy nods. Ren and Stimpy, although attacked by critics and parents, was one of the most watched television shows ever aired. The First and Second Seasons DVD is one of the most asked-for TV-on-DVD releases, and one of the best-selling. Fans absolutely eat it up.

But Nickelodeon thought otherwise. The children's network had exhaustively censored episodes, held back from its true schizophrenic, amazing potential that the show truly had, and constantly blamed the Spumco studio for its almost breath-stealing delays, they became so increasingly nervous that they kicked Spumco out in September of 1992. A decision that would cost the show dearly. In order to continue the show's ever-rising popularity, they tried hard to copy the genius that John K had started, but, eventually, they tried too hard. The show became too uninteresting, too boring, too unfunny, and just not even watchable, and it was an absolute step down from what it should of been, a taboo-breaking, definitely award-worthy show.

Without the right direction, Ren and Stimpy soon began to degrade. Now we have Ren and Stimpy: Season 5 and Half of 4. The last stand of the suffering, mistreated show.

The plots have become too generic and unmistakably bad to even care about; even the most idiotic a person can figure out what the hell's going to happen here. Let's be honest: Seasons One and Two are better directed and written than any other animated show out there today.

The humor is dry and unsatisfying. Lackluster and barely going beyond the mediocre range. Fart jokes and unneeded gross-out humor is passed with quite the frequency, and the show massively suffers from it. It's miserable, in its entirety, how these cartoons have absolute gone down the drain.

The cast? Forget it. Ren and Stimpy went from some of the most likable characters to torpid and almost totally unidentifiable. The psychotic, mentally unstable, schizophrenic chihuahua Ren is a now an emotionally challenged crybaby, figuratively, literally, and tonally. Stimpy, the mentally damaged, almost innocently devoted manx cat with unmistakable sparks of genius, to an almost totally lost from reality, happy-go-lucky idiot. By and large, nobody is even likable.

And what's even more disappointing is that it's ONCE AGAIN censored. This time, they're getting more and more ridiculous. I'm not exactly able to name every single episode cut, but here's a few big ones: ""The Last Temptation"", ""Stimpy's Pet"", and I think a large portion of ""Big Flakes"" was cut.

There's absolutely no excuses for this. Ren and Stimpy went through THREE sets, that includes the Timelife set, that were, in their entirety, not UNCUT. Seasons three through five, in their sets, suffered more so than the first and second seasons. And considering how largely spaced out and ridiculously obvious the censors are, it's from a lack of care.

Commentaries are a bust. Unlike the last two sets, which provided some of the most incredible information ANY R&S fan could ask for, the same topics are constantly repeated over and over again. Colors, drawings, comparing R&S to other cartoons, it all seems the same. John K and the usual Spumco crew come back. The only saving grace that makes the commentaries worth listening to, though being barely bearable, is bringing in Bill Wray and Scott Wills
from Games Productions, who took over R&S after Spumco was gone. Even so, they're not exactly informative either.

What would of been more appropriate was another 'R&S history' featurette explaining the true, sordid demise of the show. That would of been fitting and revolutionary. Instead, we get commentaries that barely go above the 'average' mark.

But seeing as how a masterful show like Ren and Stimpy could suffer like this, this DVD releases is quite important, because it's a lesson in animation: how not to do a show, why you shouldn't strive the product away from the true geniuses. Ren and Stimpy: Season 5 and More of 4 is an absolute train wreck of a cartoon, and one of the most saddening. I can't recommend this even if my life depended on it: Games has beaten and beaten Ren and Stimpy to the point of no return, but this set thankfully put the duo to sleep, thankfully pulled the plug that many wanted to pull, finally put this suffering show out of its much-needed misery. Not recommended.",1298678400,10,4761,4.96859296482412
2348056,5,B000A0GP2W,Such a great show...disgusting....but great. They don't make cartoons like this anymore. I highly recommend to anyone with a silly/dark humor.,1297641600,,142,5.809523809523809
2348057,5,B000A0GP2W,"This was not as of the wall as season one, but that happens when you gain a huge audiance. You cant get away with as much nutty-crunchiness.",1265932800,,140,4.222222222222222
2348058,5,B000A0GP2W,I love Ren and Stimpy... The story lines are sometimes pretty gross but almost always amusing.,1233532800,,94,4.9375
2348059,5,B000A0GP2W,"ahh, the final seasons of Ren and Stimpy. The greatest, most disturbing children's cartoon ever made. I put some blame on this show as to why I am so weird now. I take that back, it should be seen by everyone.",1230163200,,209,4.121951219512195
2348060,4,B000A0GP2W,"I brought this DVD with some birthday money only because it was the only one I hadn't seen some of yet. I wish I had rented it first. But anyway I have created a list featuring my favorites, my toleratable ones, and ones I truly hate.

I did not list every single episode, so heres the ones I have mixed feelings about or don't know what I think of them:
OTHER:
Galoot Wranglers
Ren Needs Help!
Travelogue
Space Dogged
Feud For Sale
City Hicks
Stimpy's Pet
Dinner Party
Reverend Jack Cheese

I will write what I think about some of these that people might like to know about:

Double Header-Ren and Stimpy get in a accident from getting hit by a bus, and after surgery they get sewn together! I like this episode a lot, so I rate it a 5 out of 5 stars.

Hair of the Cat-Ren is allergic to cat hair! And guess who vows to help him fell better? None other than a certain stupid feline! I like some of the Ren drawings in this episode, and a very nice plot, although I don't like how it ends, so I rate it a 4 out of 5 stars.

Ren's Brain-Stimpy removes Ren's brain in the name of science, and gets the idiot Ren hes always dreamed of, but what will Ren's brain think about this? This is easily the best episode on this set. It was written at Spumco during the first season, so it actually looks like they tried to do a Spumco cartoon from the first season, they actually sort of drew like Spumco on this one except a few scenes! I actually mistook this for a Spumco episode when I first saw it. 5 out of 5 stars.

Who's Stupid Now?-When Ren and Stimpy's boss threatens to cancel the show, Ren promises he'll do anything the boss wants, so he has them switch roles! I think this episode developed from an episode Spumco wrote (I think) called ""The Big Switch"". I like it a lot. 5 out of 5 stars.

Heres a description of (my opinion) the worst episode on this set.

The Scotsman in Space-Ren sees a Scotsman out side of there ship. They let him in and a bunch of crap happens that isn't really funny. I hate this episode. Games tried to make another Space Madness or Black Hole and it completely failed. There are a few funny parts but otherwise unfunny and stupid. 2 out of 5 stars.

I like the Commentarys on this DVD, very nice.
Still has CUTS by the way, thank goodness they didn't put UN-CUT on this DVD.
In general, if you don't have any of the other sets, please buy the first 2 seasons first, then buy seasons 3 and a 1/2-ish, Games was good when it started, but save this one for last, its really not the best.",1228521600,,2946,4.267504488330341
2348061,1,B000A0GP2W,"When I played the 1st disc I didn't remember a single episode, I guess I stoped watchind this show way back when for some reason but I'm glad I did. I didn't like a single episode on the 1st disc so I didn't even bother with the other two. Maybe it was a good thing to quit the show after this because it didn't have the humor of the older episodes and they were running out of ideas.",1205366400,3,384,3.9358974358974357
2348062,5,B000A0GP2W,this cartoon is not for kids it is for adults and it is crazy it is the best cartoon ever but you must get the complete collection,1179014400,,130,3.8518518518518516
2348063,4,B000A0GP2W,"There are quite a few more bland episodes (""A Scooter for Yaksmas,"" ""School Mates,"") in this DVD set than the previous one, but, then again, some of the episodes are absolutely outstanding.  ""Feud for Sale"" is by far the best, even though Ren and Stimpy aren't even in it.  Instead there's that crooked salesman guy who's always so darn hilarious.  ""Superstitious Stimpy"" and ""I Was a Teenage Stimpy"" are the other must-have episodes in this set, and I'm rather fond Ren and Stimpy's observance of Acromeglian customs in ""Travelogue"" myself.

But my favorite episode out of them all is probably ""Reverend Jack Cheese.""  It pretty much has no storyline, and just shows a crazy meat preacher doing insane stuff.

And I've got to admit, I did like the mantis version of Sammy Davis Jr. too.",1172275200,2,787,4.792592592592593
2348084,5,B000A0GP2W,"I am not talking about APC (damn that was horrible), but these were the final 17 episodes of the original show. some of these episodes were quite hysterical like Insomiac Ren or I was a teenage Stimpy or Pen Pals. again , sadly, there were a few cuts, but not too many. I don't understand why Paramount would do something stupid like cutting out scenes from all these episodes. it's really not necessary.",1153785600,,404,4.5479452054794525
2348085,5,B000A0GP2W,"I notice from reading other reviews that there are cuts on the season 5 DVDs. There is one cut alluded to in the commentary accompanying 'Reverend Jack Cheese' - but I never saw this segment even when it was on TV, so I'm not missing it. Aside from that, I personally haven't noticed any cuts - in fact, just the opposite. I have noticed ADDITIONS, little parts here and there I'd never seen when these shows aired on TV, which has been a delightful surprise. Maybe there were cuts, but frankly there are quite a few episodes in this boxed set I never saw on TV, so I can't make an informed judgement in that department.

Secondly, in my opinion, seasons 4 and 5 are MUCH funnier (for the most part) than season 3 (and a halfish). Maybe someone can explain this to me, but the episodes had dramatically and magically improved since season 3, several as funny or funnier than even episodes from season 1.

(Parenthetically, I must comment on some of the audio, which is warped during some episodes [only on disc 1, namely: 'Aloha Hoek,' 'Cheese Rush Days,' and 'Wiener Barons'], especially noticeable when music is playing. Some people might easily overlook this if they're not sensitive to that sort of thing, but it was slightly annoying to me. But out of 33 episodes, three of them with slight audio warping isn't that big of a deal.)

I would recommend this set more than I'd recommend season 3 in terms of humor and quality - but, of course, being a Ren & Stimpy fan, I recommend ALL the sets especially for you Ren & Stimpy fans and completists out there.",1128384000,13,1560,4.5053003533568905
2348086,4,B000A0GP2W,"Awaken, brothers of stupidity!  For-tune smiles upon us!  Now you can finally complete your `Ren and Stimpy Show' DVD collection and place it neatly between your collection of celebrity toupees and your collection of autographed glass coffee tables!  Joy! Rapture!  Sure, this set may not represent the best of the demented duo, and some of the shows might be too bizarre or too gruesome for your taste...or lack thereof...but buck up, buckaroo, `cause a bumper crop of hyjinks and hilarity can still be found growing in the fertile soil of this final extravaganza of guffaws and grotesquerie, and it's all wrapped up in a lime green box that's prettier than a jewel-encrusted Queen of England!  John K, you're one of the good ones.  Yes boys and girls, your innards will ache with glee as you witness Ren the Asthma Hound Chihuahua roasting fish gallstones over an open fire in `Aloha Hoek,' and hear Stimpson J. Cat reading Poe to his sleepless roommate in `Insomniac Ren.'  You'll learn how to scrape pollen off of bee abdomens in `Pixie King,' and sail across a river of baked beans in a hollowed-out pig in `Weiner Barons.'  `Ol' Blue Nose' will have you singing of fried eggs, stomach cramps and pocket handkerchiefs as the greatest vocalist of all time, Snotra, complains that his pasta is ""not al dente enough.""  Then, you'll be ""absotively"" horrified when Stimpy uses Ren's Robert Goulet Party Wig as a coffee filter before going on strike with the `Stupid Sidekick Union,' only to be replaced, briefly, by Baboon...which prompts Ren to wonder aloud, ""Who left this wildebeest carcass on my good sofa?""  In `Superstitious Stimpy,' you'll come to understand why ""barbequing indoors is TERRIBLE bad luck,"" especially on the unluckiest day of the year: Tuesday, Marge 17.  `City Hicks' will have you in tears when our heroes' bountiful dust crop is ruined by rain...their dust mites drowned...their poor, poor farm choked with useless fruits and vegetables.  Next, `Stimpy's Pet' will tug at your heartstrings, as that sentimental feline fool adopts an adorable abandoned circus clown...""He's all alone in the world,"" Stimpson cries, ""with no one to shave him...to floss his toes...to stroke his soft fur.""  In `Dog Tags,' Ren must prove, once and for all, that he really is a dog...rather than a mosquito or a rat-faced rodent.  Pop in Disc 3, and your belly is sure to expel a benevolent call of satisfaction after you join the master of etiquette, Ren Hoek, and his loyal and repugnant houseboy, Stimpy, for a delicious feast of honey-glazed sheep livers with dusty wig stuffing.  Guests at this regal `Dinner Party' include: Prince Mudskipper and his lovely wife, Gorgo; Sir Scotsman of Spain; Emperor Baboon; General Lummox; Ambassador Salesman; Sir Duke of Chicken; and the honorable Professor Fly and his lovely escort, Miss Rancid Meat.  After watching `Terminal Stimpy,' you'll come to realize, as Stimpy does, that ""Life is like a bowling alley: Oh, you make some strikes...if you're lucky a couple of spares...and nobody knows how to keep score...but in the end, ya gotta rent ill-fitting smelly shoes that squeak.""  Don't despair though, `cause Yaksmas Eve is right around the corner...the soot is falling, and the air is filled with the scent of roasted rubber band vendors.  Soon, `Sammy and Me' will have you laughing your screw-on thorax off.  You might even DIE laughing...but remember, ""Death is life's great reward.""  So mount a lucky boar's head on your wall, splash on some YAK-WAVELVA, pour yourself a tall frosty glass of Dog Water, and curl up in front of your ""shiny friend"" for `The Ren & Stimpy Show: Season Five and Some More of Four.'  `Cause classic cartoons and DVD's go together like mayonnaise and clams!  Now be an imbecile and go light the furnace so I can take my bath.  ...I call dibs on the shifferobe!",1128211200,8,3846,4.937888198757764
2348087,4,B000A0GP2W,"I really sometimes enjoy a great classic when it comes to animated cartoons. For greats like Ren & Stimpy, they haven't gotten the real welcome mat treatment they could've received in the process. That has been with the past releases of the Ren & Stimpy previous DVD editions of their Seasons 1 & 2, and 3 & 4 DVD packages. While they have had some moderate showcases, they just haven't been uncut like most die hard Ren & Stimpy fans wanted. Yet, with their recent comeback on the Nicktoons channel, and their status from the Spike channel a couple of years ago. There just should be more.

Ren & Stimpy Seasons Five and Some More Of Four, is a look at their final days during their Nickelodeon era. The cartoons are very, very funny, and have been remastered brilliantly. There are just so many great cartoons episodes like Superstitious Stimpy, where Ren tries getting over being jinxed over being placed under a cursed day, Space Dogged that spotlights what would ever happen if Ren & Stimpy were alive and going through a 1960's Soviet Union comsonaut program and space race, and Pen Pals showcasing Ren & Stimpy wanting to enter a maximum security prison to live in, after Ren's home is taken away by the law. While the episodes are funny and enjoyable, there really is one small disadvantage. Like the two previous DVD collections, there are some cuts to the original versions aired. Thankfully however, there aren't as many as there were in the previous editions, which is a real joy.

While it is still a shame people don't appreciate innovative animation as much as it was made years ago, Ren & Stimpy have had a cult following that has withstood the test of time. This is a must have for anybody who is new to Ren & Stimpy, and a casual favorite for die hard Ren & Stimpy fans. Oh, Joy!
