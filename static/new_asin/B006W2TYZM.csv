5022047,5,B006W2TYZM,"Well, it was a matter of time before the ""haters"" who hate the producer of this film started their smut campaign on Amazon. And it's time to reply.

First, I have purchased this film and reviewed it several times over. Second, I know Ryan Katzenbach, the producer. We're not good friends, but I have corresponded in email with him; I find him to be very honest and candid, and I found his film no less honest and candid. Shattered Hopes is in no way sensationalism or capitalization off a crime. It is a super interesting look at a dysfunctional family that seemed destined to destroy themselves and it is, honestly, a never-before told story. Forget the ghosts and demon crap, the family story is more interesting.

I have followed this documentary's website and Facebook page for about 3 years. In order to understand the comments being made here by those who wish to dis the film, and the producer, you have to understand the players and who exactly is involved and, let me tell you, there is a nasty agenda against the filmmaker for no good reason.

Since filming began, the producer has had to put up with a constant attack on his credibility by a group of people who run a website that claims that they are all about the ""truth"" behind the Amityville case. The reality is that they are not interested in the case but instead their only goal seems to be smearing Ryan Katzenbach and those on his team. If I were Katzenbach, the people who are responsible for this would have been in court a long time ago and held accountable for their actions because their actions cross well over the line of freedom of speech.

The website is run by a man named Dan Nolte who resides in Southern California. Nolte was very good friends with George Lutz, something he states on his forum. Of course, Lutz and his wife were the ones who perpetuated the whole Amityville haunting story of the 28-days in the house which I think we can all appreciate as a hoax. The original book by Jay Anson is full of inaccuracies and contradictions. And the book even contradicts itself repeatedly from one edition to the next as discussed by the Steven Kaplan book The Amityville Horror Conspiracy. (Kaplan is a repeated target of Nolte and his followers, too.) Lutz is held on the Nolte forum as a sort of God....a man whose credibility is never questioned despite being the ultimate profiteer off the film and he capitalized on the dead Defeos which is something demonstrated by the probate papers that Katzenbach's team dug up from the courts. But, of course, in their claims again the producer of Shattered Hopes, they claim that he is the one trying to capitalize off the DeFeos while Lutz is given a free pass. When you read their forum, their bias and hatred of the producer of this film is clear as a bell and as a result there is zero objectivity. It is not surprising that their forum members, trying to disguise themselves as objective reviewers, are here trying to dissaude you, the Amityville enthusiasts or true crime fans from spending your money on this film. The film is well worth the price, and it is a must view for anyone interested in this subject matter. And this is not just my opinion, just go to the documentary's Facebook page and read the comments made by those who have purchased the DVD as well those who have already posted here. These positive comments burn Nolte and his followers to the point of reacting with as many negative reviews as possible.

In the past 3 years, the personal attacks on the producers and anyone else that the forum disagrees with have been absolutely disgusting to read. They attack personal attributes of people instead of sticking to the subject matter. They constantly twist the producers words to make them suit the truth that they want people to believe.

Living in southern Cal, I looked into Dan Nolte because I have just found his remarks over the top. In April last year, Mr. Nolte filed chapter 7 bankruptcy and clipped his credit cards for over $25G. Yet in the past he has speculated and allowed others to speculate on Katzenbach's finances and how the movie he made was funded, even despite Katzenbach's very candid statements that there are no investors and the film was made out of pocket. I also found a YouTube site under ""dantemadison"" which is apparently Dan Nolte's personal channel. Nolte has stated that Katzenbach's movie, even years before it was released, would be worst than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" When you look at his YT profile, you see that Nolte in his younger days was an aspiring creative type who took a stab at filmmaking. And when you watch what he filmed, you realize that his work, ""Santuary"", IS worse than ""Plan 9."" His hate for Katzenbach stems from his own failure. Apparently, Nolte was so desperate for attention and to be on television, he even went as far as to appear on hatemonger Wally George's show back in the 1980's. For those of us who remember Wally George.....well.....I'm rolling my eyes. For those not in the know, Wally George was a cheesebag UHF talk show called ""Hot Seat"" out of Anaheim in the early 1980's.

Nolte lives in an apartment in Fullerton and works as a graphic artist from his home when he's not busy parked on his forum tossing garbage at Katzenbach. Based on his bankruptcy schedules filed with the Federal Court, he'd be better suited spending more time WORKING and less time crapping on others. He is joined by a group of other losers who spend their time attacking Shattered Hopes.

I felt that it was important to bring this out and to understand WHERE these reviews of Shattered Hopes are REALLY coming from. They are NOT objective or honest and they are only designed to attack the filmmaker. I've sat back and watched it for long enough and I felt it was time to reply. Nolte and his morons may have their forum and there may not be anything anyone can say to defend the filmmaker over there because any reply will be removed or the pack will immediately gang up to attack anyone who defends Shattered. BUT, here is different. If you want to venture off your forum and attack this documentary and Katzenbach on a public website like this one, be prepared for a reply. I hope there are more fans and supporters out there who will also join in who feel the same way.

Some time back Nolte's forum accused Katzenbach of purposely not interviewing those connected to the case which is something in the past week even Katzenbach talked about on his FB page. He was attacked for this and forum members claimed that Ryan would not interview people connected with the family because he was afraid that Geraldine Gates, who is a character in this story as the ex girlfriend of Ronnie DeFeo, would be discredited. Well, unlike these people on the website, Katzenbach remained quiet and did not disclose who he had interviewed or hadn't. But when Part I came out, some of the people interviewed in the film were friends of the Defeos who knew quite well. And while we don't know what they will have to say about Geraldine (which the producer says will be discussed in the final portion of the film yet to be released) their stories about the Defeos painted a scary picture of what life was like for the family. The people that the forum claimed Katzenback would avoid were the people that were interviewed in depth in the film, something that caused me to laugh because I thought about how Nolte and his followers must have been smoking hot after watching this. Bottom line - for those really following all of this - Katzenbach has made Nolte and his followers look like uniformed idiots repeatedly.

One of the people the forum asked Katzenbach directly about was the Nonnewitzes. For those who don't know who all the people involved in the story are, these people were very close to the DeFeos. Mrs. Nonnewitz was the Defeos housekeeper, and she was very close to Louise DeFeo for several years before the murders. While Mrs. Nonnewitz died before being interviewed, her husband told her story as well as his own personal memories of the Defeos. These were people who probably knew the Defeos better than anyone else and since I have never seen them interviewed anywhere, they were people who seem very important to the story. Kudos to Katzenback for getting an account no one else ever has.

Katzenback was grilled for not interviewing the Nonnewitzs and Nolte and his cult pack made a big deal about this. But after the film came out, and after they saw that Katzenbach HAD interviewed Nonnewitz, then their song suddenly changed and instead of accepting that they had been wrong now they simply claim that Nonnewitz gave a sort of revisionist history or that he is wrong in his recollections. My point in saying this is that no matter what Katzenbach presents or asserts, this forum will spin it around and discount whatever evidence is presented. This is not an objective view of the facts and it is this very forum, run by Dan Nolte, that is all about ""revisionist"" history. Somehow these people think that they somehow know far more than Mr. Nonnewitz about this story. Their fabrication of facts outweighs the eyewitness testimony of someone who lived the story and was really there. THIS is the truth according to them and them only. And anyone who reads their reviews on here should know where it is coming from before passing judgement on this film or this team of filmmakers. And it is apparent that these negative reviews are written by members of this forum because they harp about the same things that are said over and over and over and over and over at the forum - the same crap over and over year after year after year.

The forum goes on and on about Geraldine Gates and whether or not she was real. For the last umpteen years, Ryan K. has said openly and candidly that Geraldine is a sideline story to the real Defeo case and to the murders themselves. As he has said, whether you believe her or don't, it doesn't affect the outcome of what's in the film-- whatever the findings may be that come out in the last segments.

The website claims that Geraldine met DeFeo in prison and cooked up this strategy for a new trial. They support Defeo's assertions that he met Geraldine after 1985. The story that has been presented in Shattered and throughout Rick Osuna's book The Night The DeFeos Died claims that Geraldine was married to DeFeo before the murders in 1974. Whether he was married to her or whether they met in 1985, as Katzenbach has said, it's really ireelevant. They had a long term relationship and Katzenbach has years of their letters in his possession. So whether they were together before the murders or they met in 1985, Geraldine had a 20 year relationship with DeFeo and as Katzenbach said, this makes her a relevant witness which ever way you slice it. But this falls on deaf ears over there at the website. Their case against this film is that it is in sole reliance upon Geraldine's account. Having viewed this film, that is absolutely NOT THE CASE. With or without Geraldine, this docudrama stands on its own feet. What is especially interesting to me, is that Geraldine's details and accounts sync perfectly with those people who were there. For someone who is lying, she sure sounds pretty damn convincing to me and its plain to see that Geraldine is talking about the same people that Roger Nonnewitz and Louise's friend Gloria are talking about.

Ryan Katzenbach on his FB page and his own website has made no attempt to hide any of the stories given by Geraldine. Regarding the bogus brother from the trial in the 1990's, Katzenbach posted a clip on his FB page wherein Geraldine very openly and colorfully discusses how this whole bogus brother story came to be. Yet again....it falls on deaf ears. In the review here, Salerno makes a big issue with it and tries to present it like its something that is being covered up by Katzenbach. Fact is, its right out there in the open for discussion and it was put out in the open by Katzenback HIMSELF. These are hardly the actions of someone trying to dupe the public.

Also right out in the open are the very property records, Suffolk County DA's records, and birth certificate that these forum members drone on and on about. Months back, Ryan Katzenbach discussed on the Facebook page the deed that supposedly proves that Geraldine lived upstate at the time of her relationship with Ronnie. As I recall, without going back and looking at Ryan's post, the individual who sold the property could not verify Geraldine's identity at all after he asked if she could do so. There were other inconsistencies, such as misspellings in official documents and other contradictions that suggest that these documents had been tampered with. Bottom line -- the forum asserts that Geraldine is a fraud, and while Katzenbach can't seem to offer 100% proof (which is moot at any rate when you consider that Geraldine DID have a relationship with Defeo) of her existence, the forum can only present circumstantial documents that prove she is a fraud. And again, repeating myself, it doesn't matter anyway because Geraldine is NOT the story being presented.

One of the things that Katzenbach talked about on his Facebook page, which prompted me to find an out of print copy, is Betsy Carrington's book Judicial Carousel. Betsy was the legal secretary of William Weber, Ronnie DeFeo's defense counsel. In the book, she talks about a woman who came into Weber's office IN THE 1970'S wanting to see Weber and claiming that she was the wife of Ronnie DeFeo and the child with her was Ronnie's. Also, as Katzenbach has pointed out, Hans Holzer who wrote Murder In Amityville quizzed Ronnie during the 1970's as to whether he was married and had children, something that is printed in his book. Rick Osuna also has a soundbyte on his website wherein Holzer admits to meeting Geraldine back when. But, will we ever see Nolte's group talk about this? Nope. Sorry.

And another thing we never hear about is how Rick Osuna and Katzenbach spanked George Lutzs butt in court several years ago. Lutz came after both of them over a bad business dealing with Rick, but what the real agenda was was to shut Rick's book down. Plain and simple. In the end, Lutz got nothing. Same with Ronnie Defeo who also sued and claimed that Geraldine was a fraud. When I asked Ryan Katzenbach for the docs pertaining to the lawsuit, he actually sent them to me via a series of Acrobat files. When you read it, it becomes evident that if Ronnie Defeo had a case against Geraldine or Rick or Ryan he would have won something -- but he didn't. And in all cases wherein he sued, he was tossed out on his rear. Where is the forum to discuss this? NO WHERE because it would paint Noltes dead buddy, George Lutz, as an idiot who lost every lawsuit he ever filed.

When these people assert what Shattered Hopes will or will not present, they are complete idiots. They have no idea what Katzenbach's film will bring forward. Remember, these are the same people who all claimed that the film never bothered to interview anyone who knew the Defeos -- something that they had to eat after the DVD came out and were proven wrong. And last week, Katzenbach shut them up pretty good again when he proved that Rick Osuna had visited the Amityville Horror house. Rick claimed he met the owner and got a tour and for a long, long time the website has challenged this and called Rick a liar. Ryan Katzenbach had correspondence with this owner who, in writing did state that it did happen. So once again these website forum members who act like they know everything are proven to be idiots who really know NOTHING.

These people are not in ANY type of authoritative position to talk about this film, a point that Katzenbach has made over and over until he is blue in the face. The problem is that there are more people who have raved about Shattered Hopes and more of us who really understand what is going on and what is really happening than what they think. And I decided that if they can run their pie holes to distort facts and twist the truth, then its time someone who does know what is going on stands up. I don't know what the next segments of this film hold in store...I can't even begin to guess. But whatever comes out, I am sure it will be substantiated and interesting and the focus will be on the Defeos and not Geraldine. So let the haters hate because every day this DVD continues to sell despite their best efforts. And for years they spouted off and claimed that this film would never see the light of day. So today its not surprising that they rant and rave and scream like a bunch of jackals.

The real truth here --- the film is a must see if you are into Amityville or true crime. It was put together by a passionate filmmaker who wanted to tell this story better than anyone else. And I think that this team behind Shattered has done exactly that. The haters are the haters and there is no convincing them, but before they can convince anyone that Katzenbach is some bad person with questionable credibility, it is important that even the most casual viewer understand the real agenda and hate and jealousy going on here. The film is honest and so is the filmmaker. Don't be fooled by individuals like Dan Nolte. Its high time that these people get a dose of their own medicine back and even if no one else will say it, I will stand up. Ryan Katzenbach is an artist and he's been savaged and held to ridicule by those who are so jealous of his research and tenacity that they can't see straight. That alone speaks for itself. Shattered will be, mark my words, the best film series ever done on this case and it will take its spot with the greats and it will be talked about even after the haters and their disgusting website is long gone.",1334966400,5,19545,4.592666857633915
5022048,2,B006W2TYZM,"Running just shy of two hours, Shattered Hopes is the only Amityville product to feature NO ghosts and NO murders!  With pretensions to be more than just a fan-made look at the story which spawned The Amityville Horror - Part I of this ""Three part trilogy"" (!) will eventually grow into a 6 hour epic of THE UNTOLD TRUE STORY... of which this disc is just the beginning!

However, it's mostly based on fabrication...

This is conspiracy theory played as fact. Shattered Hopes asks us to swallow the tale that Ronald DeFeo had a secret wife and fathered a secret child BEFORE the crime, and the police, defence, prosecution and Judge all hushed it up..!

Geraldine, the ""wife"", gets most airtime here -- although introduced as a ""controversial figure"" she's amazingly given the all-clear far too early, and installed as the main mouth-piece.  Quickly followed by the director himself, plus the author of the book - all three speak as if they actually knew the DeFeo's lives, which we hoped would be ""told by those who were there"" as the stated on the DVD's back cover.

The clips of real ""friends of the DeFeo's"" are good, but serve only as interesting side-bars, rather than to drive the narrative along, and none of them are asked ""Do you remember Geraldine back the 1970's?"" -- a huge and telling omission.  Not to mention in the Extras where the childhood friend of one of the DeFeo boys says of Ronnie ""I had no idea he was married""...!

It takes a special kind of ego to try and pull off this con, and the director has already announced Parts II and III will NOT be available on Amazon, apparently because they allow bad reviews here!  As well as having control-issues, he claims his detractors ""need desperately to believe in the haunting"" when Part I has nothing to do with the Lutzes and is being judged on its own merit.

We also get amateurish chunks of drama, hidden behind a layer of Grindhouse-effect, as if the director has no confidence in what he has shot. Also, it's a pity everything is dialled-down from the book, where the night of the murders played like a demented feverish musical. (Special mention must be given to the uneven soundmix - GUNSHOTS and ROCK MUSIC are set way higher than the dialogue - try playing this at night and not waking the whole house up)

Obviously a one-star product - gaining an extra point for the people who really did know the DeFeo's - Shattered Hopes is created by egomaniacs, more interested in quick & easy adulation from their fans, rather than unearthing any sort of lasting truth.  The director has publicly admitted Judge Stark told him he ""doesn't understand the case"", yet here he carries on with this alleged true expose -- for two whole hours! Every question mark over Geraldine is ignored, and any criticism of Shattered Hopes is written off as ""Cyber Bullying"" (!) yet the makers would be the first to tell you this subject is controversial... but they ignore all the counter-arguments out there, including proof that Geraldine only married Ronnie in prison during the 1980's... however that would interfere with their narrative, where impartiality is not an option.

And then it ends and we have to wait for Part II.

Now the director - odds on to be the next documentary filmmaker to be ""Jackin' it in San Diego"" (sadly not due world-wide acclaim) - has secured a 6-page spread in Maxim magazine after discovering a gun in the canal down from the house.  The ""extra weapon"" he claims was used in the murders - despite it NOT MATCHING the alleged ""extra weapon"" in the book his film is based on!

If you like your child-murder documentaries to be bloated, manipulative, Godless affairs, then this is for you.",1334793600,18,3675,4.674418604651163

5022053,5,B006W2TYZM,"(This review may and does contain some spoilers)

I have been an avid fan of the Amityville story since I can remember, but it came full force back in February 1989 with my first reading of ""The Amityville Horror"". I chose to read this because my mother had picked up a copy of ""High Hopes"" at the library at the same time. Needless to say I was hooked with both stories and enjoyed comparing and contrasting the two stories.

  I must commend the producers on every aspect of this documentary. They have welcomed us back to Amityville circa 1974! It is everything that a fan has ever wanted to see and hear and would be welcomed by any newcomer as well. For me, this has been 23 years in the making.

The small snippet of the movie ""The Amityville Horror"", brought everything full circle. Hearing the first bar of that chilling theme is acknowledging the past sensationalism of this story and really places you in the context, for that theme IS that movie, and to use a bar ties in the documentary perfectly. I was hoping that they going to somehow use that theme and I am glad it showed up despite what we now know it to be.

Telling the ""official story"" in brief will bring any person with vague familiarity of the murders up to speed and help them recall what has been written and presented prior in newspapers, books, on TV and in the movie(s).

The flow of the story is well paced. I was always wondering how Geraldine ( a highly controversial character who has to be questioned and whether she was there or knows everything 100%, she knows enough to portray the DeFeo's) would come to play in this film. I got the impression that she was ""A "" story teller, but not of her story, because really, I never felt for one moment that this story was about her. Otherwise you would have a documentary called ""My Life as a DeFeo""!  She is rough on the outside, but inside I think her heart shined for love of a family that she knew and yes you could tell, it still hurts.  The doubts raised about her by many critics seem to be erased. The only factoid that I did not see or was left out was the fact Geraldine surfaced in a Newsday article in March 1986, so it makes it sound like Ric discovered her in that 1999 phone call (which was well done) and she made herself known only to Ric. (This point gets clarified by the producers later on - stating that they wanted to tell the story of how the whole project came to be put together in 1999)

Having the experts tell us what was happening is something nobody has done before with this story. We are always led to believe that it was solely Butch that should be blamed and that he was ungrateful for what his family gave him. When mixed in with the personal stories of the family friends interviewed, this makes them real. You needed them to tell this story, you needed that insight and I am extremely happy that they participated.

The recreations and reenactments of the DeFeo family was extremely well done. I almost like how this was not high end acting or ""CSI"" acting, but it was what you would expect to hear and see if you actually set up a video tape in the DeFeo home. It brings a reality to the film.  Jon Southwell as Big Ronnie played a cunning and very much the liking to hate character when he gets more and more manic.  Diana as Louise I felt, for no prior acting, really portrayed her as I would have imagined her. I always felt Louise was minimalized in many of the other stories and here the ""learned helplessness"" shines through, something we really did not know. The regality that emanated from her portrait was reflected on screen. She was faithful to her husband and family while they all crumbled around her. There were really brought the DeFeo's to life, made them real human beings who lived in a house in Amityville.

I also appreciate how Butch is not the main focus of this documentary, because I am sure we see him more in Parts 2 & 3.  Sullivan and others always made it out that Butch was the sole reason behind the murders, but it is depicted so well as to how each member of the family was on a course of self destruction. I almost feel that if Butch (and to be seen others, Dawn) did not murder his family, Big Ronnie and even Louise would have taken matters into their own hands to get themselves out of the hell that they lived in.  Leaving out portrayals of Marc and John and mostly Allison, leaves them with their innocence of childhood which is how they need to be remembered.

The choice of portraying the house as a character prominently in this film was a great choice as it was always an important role! This is not a haunted house, but the false facade of the DeFeo's ""High Hope's"". To the outside, it was the American dream but inside it held so much horror that a few would ever see. You take us inside the walls of this house and the hell that blossomed the day that Ronnie and Louise met.  Calling it Big Ronnie's castle was so appropriate and how it reflected on him and who he was is a story not many have heard. The story of a ""well to do car salesman"" is shattered here.  His castle was only his in name and its occupants were prisoners. You truly shatter all the misconceptions of what was depicted by media and cranks over the past 37 years.

The most haunting and emotional segment has to be the ""Ave Maria"" and the dark shadow handing Butch the gun. Because although you know the outcome, the producers present a story of the life of the DeFeo's, something nobody has ever done (with the horrible exception of Amityville II). And unlike a reviewer of that film, who said, ""frankly you do not care what happens to the family"". You make us care, you make us get into the minds and actions of the DeFeo's and for a moment until that ""Ave Maria"", you almost hope that they work things out. In the many times I have viewed this DVD, I have gotten tears in my eyes at this point every time. That is excellent work.

The word I hear a lot in this film is ""hope"".  When Geraldine ends with ""Augie playing the piano, in hopes they did not hear the conversation"", it heart wrenching that all the hopes are gone.

Technicalities:

The music makes your heart pump with the excitement of the story and brings the emotion that life was extremely high strung.

The mixing of archive news footage, Holzer's - ""Murder in Amityville"" and new reinacted cuts flow seamlessly, they aide the storytelling greatly.

I honestly do not have anything negative to say, because frankly, I wanted this story and this is what I got. This is what I wanted to know in 1989!

My thought is, after viewing this, if you had a several million dollar big budget to produce this film, it would not be as good as it is now. You are telling a magnificent story, the images are supplementary, for you could broadcast this on a radio program and you would get the same effect. For anyone who wants high caliber/ high end Hollywood special effects is not looking for a good story, and in this case, telling the story of the DeFeo family and bringing it to light along with their dignity to who they were will always be a better story than a heavily makeup-ed actor wielding a gun chasing his family around a house. They took the time and the years to care, and in this age of sensationalism, the finished product is a success.",1328832000,6,7288,4.363367799113737

The details are extrodinary and the first hand accounts from people who were there make you feel as though you to were a fly on the wall-no pun intended.

I personally think that all of us know at least one family that resembles the DeFeos on some level, maybe even within our own walls. Ryan Katzenbach and Company have brought the family back to live like no one ever has, nor in my opinion, ever could. It took someone with the thirst for truth and justice for this family to give them voices and dementions beyond the rumors and lies. We find here a real family that we care about and find compassion for whilst being sickened by the family dynamics and dysfunction. There is no doubt in my mind that Ronnie Sr. was a very sick, deluded, conflicted man with grandioise visions of himself.
 Mr. Katzenbach has done a beautiful job, in his years of painstaking devotion to the truth and this family, of presenting the facts to us in precise detail from those who were there, and leaving us to decide for ourselves how we feel about this story. I have found that I am more sympathetic to Ronnie Jr. now than ever before. Not to say he is not where he belongs, but that I can now understand the pathology more clearly. There were so many oppertunities for things to have turned out differently, but the social norms of the 70's wee not the same or as stringent as they are today. The hyper religiousity of Ronnie Sr. is a true mental illness and to marry that thinking with the conflict he was living with while being devoutly religious, yet breaking all the commandments at the same time. This is a pot of brewing madness that suffocates all who live with it. There is no real mystery as to why things exploded as they finally did.
My hat is off to Ryan Katzenbach and all who worked on this film. The music was great, the actors believable, the dialouge real, and the first hand accounts priceless. I was so impressed with Geraldine and her accounts. I find her to be sincere and truthful. My Lord, this woman has not recieved one red bloodied cent from anything related to the exploitaon of this family! I thank all who participated as it has finally told the truth of what happened and why. I feel this film speaks for itself and has put to shame all the detactors of the truth, Mr. Katzenbach and Geraldine. My mind is still turning as I write this, a lump still in my throat, and I wait with baited breath for the next installment! Thank you Katco Media for giving the truth to all of us who have cared since way back when this story first hit the media.",1327104000,8,3123,4.393782383419689

5022058,5,B006W2TYZM,"A very good DVD.  It gave real insight into the DeFeo family.  The acting was great, especially Jon Southwell's portrayal of Ron DeFeo Sr.  Although many people have stated that the late Mr. DeFeo could be very difficult, I think it had a lot to do with repressed anger because the man was constantly upstaged by his father-in-law.  Butch, I believe, had a lot of pain inside of him.  The movie makes it obvious that  he was his father's personal punching bag, and you can tell that Sr. wanted to be the puppet master of Butch. and you can see Butch's struggle to be free of his father.  You could tell Louise was the long-suffering wife, and Dawn was ready to explode from all the anger.  It's truly a sad story of a family, each member tainted somehow.  The narration was terrific and it was truly a wonderful movie, although the family situation was heartbreaking to say the very least.  From the comments of family friends and the movie, it appears that Ronald DeFeo Sr. had some mental health issues.  From reading about the DeFeo family and seeing the movie, it just seems like he was headed for a nervous break down.  His behavior is almost neurotic.  No one will ever really know the whole truth, but I can tell you this:  It seems to me that you had a husband and wife, the wife's father was constantly catering to her and upstaging her husband, the husband never had the chance to provide for his family because his father-in-law was always interfering.  As a result, the husband gets angry because he obviously feels his manhood is compromised.  As a second result, he forces his will harder and harder on his children and his wife.  The oldest son takes drugs, drinks, is wild.  The other children start to crack under the father's pressure.  The family blows apart with all this anger.  Sometimes I think the way the murders went down is this:  Ron Jr. was strung out on something, and in that haze, he shot his family, and when he sobered up he realized he did something he should not have done.  I do not believe Butch DeFeo is a cold blooded killer.  I think he was high, and killed his family while on drugs, and regretted it later.  In any event, may they all rest in peace.",1441843200,,2192,4.4634760705289676
5022059,2,B006W2TYZM,"I gave this two stars instead of one because it does show some pictures of the DeFeo family I had not seen before. Other than that it is a re-hashing of what I already knew, added with a bunch of stuff I doubt is true at all. There is no proof anywhere that Geraldine was ever married to Butch DeFeo when she said she was, and there is MUCH evidence pointing to the fact she was NOT married to him at the time of the murders.

The quality of this documentary is not very good, i'm guessing most of their money went to the payroll of Ed Asner. (Still not sure why he is involved in this at all, other than money, of course.) The editing leaves something to be desired and it just doesn't flow very well. The opening music sounds like it was done by a poor man's Charlie Clouser, and the music throughout reminds me of the song ""Drug Ballad"" by Eminem.

It's horrible that how many can capitalise on this 40 year old tragedy before there are no ways to conjure up any more versions or liars that can cash in on this crime, long ago?

Would it be too much trouble to simply have Mrs. Gerry Defeo or Gerry Romodone or Gerry Claus or whomever else she's ""GHOSTED"" down the aisle with, TO SIMPLY PRODUCE A PICTURE OF HERSELF WITH THE DEFEO'S, in all the time she ""claims"" to have been at 112 Ocean Avenue with this family??

5022066,4,B006W2TYZM,"Watch with an open mind! People have been put to death only later to find out they were innocent with the use of DNA technology.  I am not saying Butch was innocent but I don't understand how people can paint such broad strokes of simplicity about a very complex case that was rampant with abuse of power from the Suffolk County PD (which was proven time and time again long before AND after the Defeo murders), court testimonials from both state and defense experts finding it almost impossible Butch acted alone, and of course the handgun! ! This is the crucial piece of evidence that UNEQUIVOCALLY justifies and gives complete credence to Geraldine, Ryan Katzenbach, and Ric Osuna!

If it wasn't for the tenacity of Ric and Ryan the truth would not even be pursued. It's easy to say the courts did their job and that's it. ""Open and shut""  BUT as we have seen in so many trials that have passed through our judicial process as far back as the Salem Witch trial of 1692 the verdict isn't necessarily the TRUTH.

Why didn't Suffolk County PD with their entourage of experts, ""high tech"" forensic equipment, or endless hours of sifting through discovery even mention another weapon. They didn't. Why? Because they had that all too familiar tunnel vision that still exist to this day. So let's not get fixated on the semantics of the acting or budget of this documentary and let's focus on the sustenance.  Hats off to Ric Osuna and Ryan Katzenbach for their tireless efforts and dedication to truly shedding light on a case that has nothing to do with paranormal activity but everything to do with exposing the issues that are a part of today just as much as they were in 1974 such as domestic violence,  mental/behavioral disorders, corruption, and the most infectious tunnel vision.",1406505600,,1784,4.720257234726688

Like Ric Osuna, I read the Amityville Horror as a kid. I kinda figured out the whole ""Horror"" part of it, was a hoax after book sequals kept coming out. But.. to this day.. not having the entire truth come concerning the murders is intersting to say the least.
I think Ric Osuna's book ""The Night the Defeo's Died"" is as close as we'll get to finding out.
As for this documentary... not bad, but you can tell it ended in a way that a "" part 2"" was supposed to come out. Not sure that will happen, so it kind of leaves you hanging. The crime scene phot's are not for the weak of heart. There is one of Louise that was quite disturbing.

There is so much B.S. surrounding this case and I have no doubt in his sincerity for getting at the truth with this documentary.  The weirdos that actually believe the Lutz's story attack this poor guy on a regular basis.  I really enjoyed hearing from the people who were actually there.  But are rarely heard from with other documentaries simply because it doesn't perpetuate the ghost story that everybody loves.  And makes money off of.

The Bad:  The actors in the re-enactments are ok to absolutely horrible!  The low budget area of this film really shows here.  The other problem that becomes apparent for the director is the re-using / Re-cycling of shots.  One gets the feeling that the director simply just ran out of material or inserts to fill the spaces to advance the narrative. Speaking of which,  Ed Asner does this and I have to say that I feel it was delievered in a rather indifferent tone.  So it kind of gives the narration a flat dynamic.  There's nothing about his words that pull me into the story.
  Last,  there are serious holes in the story.  Many things don't make a lot of sense and one is left scratching their head with a few of the theories.  This is supposed to be a 3 part series and I can only hope the gaps are mended.

The Ugly:  The music in this project is complete amatuer hour.  It actually would annoy me to listen to it as this film went along.  There are High School Music  students who could have done better!",1354579200,,1533,4.490909090909091

5022086,1,B006W2TYZM,"If you love unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and revisionist fantasy all wrapped up in an amateurish documentary which drags on for way too long, then you'll love this movie.

Ronnie DeFeo confessed to killing his family back in 1974.  He confessed to the police and he confessed again in open court during his trial.  Pretty much an open and shut case, even though (as with many murders) one can only guess as to the motivation.

In the years since, he has tried desperately to get out of jail, and, like many prisoners, he has blamed his crimes on a multitude of other people, offering the public many different fantasy stories about ""what really happened that night.""

This documentary is based on one of those wild stories.  Nothing wrong with that.  Trouble is, however, the audience is force-fed this fantasy as if it were the absolute truth.

What was once pretty much a cut & dry case is now a bizarre entanglement of alleged abusive parents, mob conspiracies and police coverups (anything to make this murder case more interesting to potential DVD buyers), all told by a woman who claims she was married to DeFeo in the 1970s (despite a total lack of any supporting evidence).

This film is very bad on many levels.  The information presented is all over the place and very misleading.  If you are truly interested in the DeFeo murder case, your best bet would be to read Gerard Sullivan's excellent book ""High Hopes"" -- to date the definitive work on this matter.
