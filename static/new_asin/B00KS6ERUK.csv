6444911,5,B00KS6ERUK,"Saw the show at Talking Stick Casino in Scottsdale.  It was great.  Looking forward to hearing ""Cold Outside of your Heart"".  One of my favorites although he did not sing it at Talki ng Stick.  Should be worth the price of the dvd.  I've been waiting to hear him sing it live for years!!!  Hope it has the interview at the end as the one on his web sight does.  His shows always leave you wishing you could see them again.  Now you can!",1405641600,2,436,4.107142857142857

1. Tuesday Afternoon
2. It s Up To You / Lovely To See You
3. In Your Blue Eyes
4. The Western Sky
5. Land Of Make Believe
6. New Horizons

Often the Blu-Ray/DVD will also include a backstage interview and bonus videos.  For example, the Live in San Juan Capistrano DVD included a video of ""Silverbird"" and ""The Way of the World"" along with a backstage interview.

Justin's ""Live in San Juan Capistrano"" was an excellent DVD.  The sound was great and his voice was fantastic.  He sounded even better live (his voice was much warmer in concert than on his CD) when he performed his songs from The View From The Hill.  The whole DVD including his band's performance was fantastic!

Since this is a Blu-Ray disc, the audio and video will hopefully be even better!  A Justin Hayward concert starts at fantastic and works its way up from there!  This Blu-Ray performance will not disappoint!

6444918,4,B00KS6ERUK,"I must admit to a bit of trepidation as i popped in this DVD.  Justin is aging, and well loved songs without the rhythm section and flute we have loved for 40 years?  Well!  The show starts slowly but then picks up, and Justin lets his voice hit both upper register and power notes with an ease belying his age.  There is an age related huskiness which is natural, but its the same Justin and boy does he deliver.  Now the band - one excellent keyboardist, one good backing guitar player and one slightly disappointing bit of eye candy.  But the star is Justin and he adds a wonderful living room intimacy in his storytelling, related with great humility and awareness of the stages of his life.  A word on the production - wonderful video presentation, great DTS - MA, but I did feel that Justin's guitars could have been mixed louder, and Mike's lower.  All in all, the new songs were lovely, and the old songs generally freshened with some wanting bits.  I will watch this a few more times for sure.  Well done Justin!!",1467849600,,1022,4.446236559139785
6444919,5,B00KS6ERUK,"WOW! Justin's vocals were exceptionally great! His songs included several from his ""Spirits of the Western Sky"" album plus Moody Blues favorites. ""Forever Autumn"" was an outstanding bonus song. The performance was slanted towards acoustical guitars but some electric guitar based on Justin's recorded performances was ably provided by Mike Dawes. Mike and Justin had fun playing together and each added some novel flourishes.  Alan Hewitt delivered timely synthesizer and keyboard riffs that were reminiscent of  the Moodies sound. Most live albums are disappointing but this exceeded my wildest expectations. Justin gave some background for many of his songs which really helped me understand them in a very personal way. This was most welcome, as musicians generally don't like to do this, so that the music speaks for itself. The level of excellence, beauty and love displayed throughout this performance was truly amazing. Justin can still ""bring it"" after all these years.",1466899200,,977,5.421052631578948
6444920,5,B00KS6ERUK,"Justin just keeps getting better with age. This compilation is a 'tribute' to a few of his solo albums, and a couple of Moody songs that have been reworked with different styles - like Bluegrass!!! Yes - Bluegrass!!

Since most of Justin's solo works always tell a very personal story - this one's no different. I can't help but wonder that a couple of the songs on this album are really recollections and memories from his youth when he and his brother had the whole world in front of them? In several interviews that Justin has given about this album - he so much as says that these songs are very personal to him. And they are all executed brilliantly.

His Live shows that I've attended since the album was released - have been a pure joy to attend. He mixes a nice combination of Moody classics with his own material from this album. It's a show you don't want to miss. It's just Justin, Mike Dawes and Julie Raggins - in a fantastic acoustic and keyboard experience that really does transport the listener back to those wonderful days of future passed ....

I hope Justin can continue to tour solo, and create new music for all of us who cherish his songwriting and arranging skills - and who have relied on his music throughout these many years - to console us and lift us to places we never imagined we could go.",1463443200,2,1320,4.423868312757202

6444922,5,B00KS6ERUK,"My decision to purchase this performance was curious. I have seen the Moody Blues so often that it was hard to imagine how one more presentation would add to the mix. I was wrong. As he always seems to, Justin Hayward completely disarms the listener with candid insights into his life, and a selection of some of his best music.

This needs to be said, PLEASE let's get THE MOODY BLUES into the ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL of FAME! This band is SO UNDER-RATED & UNDER-APPRECIATED!  These guys are some of the BEST SINGER/SONGWRITERS- MUSICIANS in the business! Enough with these one-wonder pop bands tat are getting elected!  THANKS",1445817600,,453,4.65

6444931,5,B00KS6ERUK,"I was fortunate enough to see Justin Hayward at the Wilbur Theater in Boston on August 21, 2015.  I loved that concert so much; I had to get this concert DVD.  There are similarities and differences between the two shows, which I will mention briefly.  Mike Dawes did an opening set that night, but did not join Justin on stage, as he does in the Buckhead Theater concert.  Justin was backed by a guitarist who may or may not have been Alan Hewitt, and was accompanied by Julie Ragins on keyboards and backing vocals.  Justin's opening song at the Wilbur Theater was ""Blue Guitar.""  He also performed the Moody Blues' songs ""Never Comes The Day"" and ""Waiting and Watching,"" none of which were performed at the Buckhead Theater.  For both concerts, the closing song was ""I Know You're Out There Somewhere.""  Justin's concerts proved that his Moody Blues songs, as well as his solo songs, work wonderfully well in a scaled-down version, performed in a small theater setting.

I feel that Justin Hayward is under-rated as a songwriter, and should be ranked up there with Lennon-McCartney, Jagger-Richards, Ray Davies, and Brian Wilson.  Highlights of both shows include moving performances of ""Tuesday Afternoon,"" ""Nights In White Satin,"" ""Question,"" ""Your Wildest Dreams,"" ""I Know You're Out There Somewhere,"" and ""Forever Autumn.""  Songs from his latest solo album, ""Spirits Of The Western Sky,"" were also served well by his live performances, especially when he talks about their inspiration, and how he came to write them.  It's too bad that Justin never appeared on MTV's Unplugged or VH-1's Storytellers shows, as he would have excelled in both venues.  In summation, all fans of the Moody Blues, Justin Hayward, or just great music in general, should buy this concert DVD.",1442102400,,1776,4.979661016949152

6444942,5,B00KS6ERUK,What's to say? Justin Hayward is a legend in his own time.

6444946,5,B00KS6ERUK,"What a great concert, featuring Hayward and a superb, highly-talented band.  A tight performance.  I prefer it to the studio album (which I like a lot!) for pure enjoyment in listening.  Nice sound, good camera work and editing.

Features outstanding songs by Hayward, with fine, fine vocals and lovely playing.  Hayward sings so well, in his unmistakable, truly great voice.  The added material is interesting and often charming.  Yes, it  lacks drums, but as Hayward correctly asserts, drums would have disrupted the acoustic guitar basis of the performance.  It is not a Moody Blues Concert, and that is fine here.  Hayward comes across as a man of spirit and heart, and approaches performing with deep sincerity and a touching modesty.",1431475200,,739,5.083333333333333

6444951,5,B00KS6ERUK,Love Justin Hayward.,1428192000,,20,6.0
6444952,5,B00KS6ERUK,"Justin Hayward is one of the most talented vocalist and guitar players in the world.  To see this concert in such a small venue is a real treat.  Backed by a keyboardist, a percussionist and a lead guitarist, the songs sound more lively and organic than a Moody Blues set.  His backup band is superb with both keyboardists on backup vocals and a lead guitarist that packs a GoPro on his guitar so you can see him play upfront.

Hayward's voice and playing is still top-notch and it's amazing to see and hear him perform at this stage in his career.  The show is there, the sound is there and the audience eats it up.  This is one of the best, most intimate shows on DVD I've seen in years - and the sound truly is superb.  There is also a lengthy backstage video showing how the band and fans interact with Justin Hayward. Another bonus treat.",1427673600,3,843,4.3312101910828025
6444953,5,B00KS6ERUK,ABSOLUTELY BRILLANT!  LOVE THIS ARTIST!,1426982400,,39,6.8
6444954,5,B00KS6ERUK,Thank you.,1426636800,,10,4.5
6444955,5,B00KS6ERUK,"I've never been a fan of The Moody Blues, but I love their 1980s hit song ""Your Wildest Dreams"" and I love their early 1990s PBS special A Night at Red Rocks. And I love Moody Blues lead singer/songwriter Justin Hayward's new PBS special Spirits... Live just as much as Red Rocks, if not more. Both are excellent presentations of excellent music.

If you like the same singer/songwriters I'm into, such as John Denver, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Michael Nesmith, you'll most probably enjoy Justin Hayward as well. He operates in a similar country/folk/pop/rock vein, yet with his own inimitable, irresistible style.

On this outing, Hayward performs many of his old band and solo classics (""Nights in White Satin,"" ""Tuesday Afternoon"") and introduces new wonders (""The Western Sky""), but with a slightly stripped down sound. Foregoing a bassist and a drummer, Hayward sings and plays lead and rhythm on various acoustic guitars, with another guitarist providing electric and acoustic accompaniment and two keyboardists providing backing vocals and lush orchestrations and percussion.

Hayward has never looked or sounded better, especially at 68 years of age. Like Nesmith, he just has the experience and wisdom of a man who's comfortable with where he is in his life now, rather than the sometimes off-putting and staged, artistic moodiness of his youth. This comes through in his stance, which is relaxed and natural, and his voice, which is as heartfelt as ever.

As I said before, Hayward has a style that blends country, folk, pop, and rock. Interestingly, if you take away the lyrics and the vocals, many of the songs would be considered new age. That's not a knock on any of those genres, including new age. That's the just way it is. The same goes for new wave and new age. The new wave sound without lyrics and vocals is also a part of new age. And there's nothing wrong with any of that.

Even though I'm not a die-hard or even casual fan, when I saw the listing for Justin Hayward: Spirits... Live, I knew I would be in for something special. I wasn't wrong.",1425945600,2,2075,4.833802816901408

He is so fabulous as a live performer, and you can tell that he still enjoys performing live.  I just can't believe that he and The Moody Blues aren't in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Those people who select the inductees are morons.  They put groups and people in there that really don't belong and don't induct The Moody Blues - what a bunch of injustice that is!  Buy this DVD.

The music is familiar, yet with a new twist on the old standards like Tuesday Afternoon & Nights in White Satin. The songs from the Spirit of the Western Sky CD are wonderful. The arrangement of Forever Autumn is the best I've ever heard Justin sing. The video is awesome and so is the sound. This new group of musicians complement each other and put new life into the music.

6444984,5,B00KS6ERUK,"This is a live performance at the Buckhead Theatre in Atlanta of Justin Haywards tour show in support of his most recent solo album, Spirits of the Western Sky.  The subsidiary material includes a documentary on the tour that is nearly one hour in length.  We see interviews with fans, sound checks, comments on the instrumentation, interviews with both Justin and his accompanying musicians, images of the merchandise table, clips from the songs and a clip of guitarist Mike Dawes warming up the audience before the show.  The live performance is long, nearly two hours in length, so that the dvd is quite a bargain.  The documentary features some scenes at the Buckhead Theatre but also an extended sequence shot at the Birchmere in Arlington, VA.

The show itself is unique in several ways.  First (as everyone says on several occasions in the documentary) it is quiet (or at least far more quiet than a Moodies performance in a large venue).  There is no drummer and no bass player.  Justin uses only acoustic guitars.  Accompanied by vocalist/percussionist/keyboard player, Julie Ragins and relatively-recent addition to the Moodies sidemen, Alan Hewitt (keyboardist), Justins featured guest artist and accompanist is Mike Dawes, a young English guitar phenom who had not yet visited the United States.  Mike plays acoustic guitar but on several of the songs (including a bluegrass version of one of them) he plays Justins Taylor, a spectacular guitar that looks like a telecaster but has an even brighter/rich-metallic sound than the Fender version.  Justin worries in the documentary that Mike is becoming too attached to that guitar.

There is an appropriate mix of Justin/Moody/new album material and many of the classic Moody songs are included.  This will be a must-have for all diehard Moody fans.  In many cases, Justins audience has been with him and his various bandmates since the late 1960s.  They know all of the materialincluding some of the more obscure materialby heart and follow the Moodies everywhere.  Several of the fans on the documentary talked about sailing on the Moodies cruise; one of the fans traveled from England to see the Justin solo tour shows just because the venues were smaller.  (Keep in mind that many of the British venuesthe BIC in Bournemouth, e.g.are very small by arena standards, so these are individuals trading 3,000 seat venues for a 1,000 or less seat venue, in other words, diehard fans.)

My only reservation comes down to a matter of taste.  I do not think the Spirits of the Western Sky material is as strong as that in the other solo albums, but from the interviews in the documentary, many very knowledgeable fans are delighted with it.  So check it out for yourself.  As usual in these shows, Justin talks to the audience between songs and has very interesting things to say.  The Moodies comments to the audience tend to be highly scripted, brief and formulaic, so this is a significant departure for fans who have only seen Justin with the Moodies.  In this recorded performance, e.g., Justin talks about selling his London home in the mid 90s, downsizing to an apartment (in Monaco; he doesnt mention that), etc.  He talks about life on the road and how much he enjoys it.  In the documentary video he talks about emailing his wife, Marie, and the witty response that he receives.  He provides the backstory for his introduction to and performance of Forever Autumn, the superb song from The War of the Worlds show.

Buy it for the music but also for an insight into how the band travels, eats and prepares for a performance.  This is three hours of great fun.",1414195200,3,3623,4.885433715220949

As I write, this Justin Hayward will be in my hometown, (Atlanta) where this video was made in 4 more days. So I'm glad I ordered this since I won't be able to make the concert. He's still at the top of his game and give's every thing in this performance. He does some new material, but he also gives us what we all crave, those beautiful songs like Tuesday Afternoon, New Horizons and many more. This DVD is loaded with warmth and all the charm Justin has always shown. If your a Moody Blues fan, or a fan of Justin Hayward, why haven't you already bought this DVD ? I promise you will love it.

It does always make me wonder why can't an artist do this with the same band members he has been a part of for years with his other friends and collaborators. But this cd or dvd is amazing in it's own right. Justin does songs from his single cd of Spirits and his signature Moody Blues songs too. It's wonderful and an up close feeling .

I attended the show in Atlanta where this was filmed, and the only criticism I have is that the curtain act's (Mike Dawes) performance was not included in the DVD, however he joins the Justin Hayward performance after the opening song to play accompaniment with the other two band members Alan Hewitt and Julie Ragans and it works very well.  There is a short bit of ""Boogie Shred"" by Mike Dawes in the documentary - so you get a taste of his solo performance - love the ""GoPro' camera attached to the head of the guitar where you see the finger work on the fret board.  Hayward is an absolute legend and Dawes is a young rising talent - with consummate, experienced pros like Hewitt and Ragins the quality of the production and amazing content make this a 5-star PLUS!!!!",1412294400,,947,4.762195121951219
6444994,5,B00KS6ERUK,"Despite the fact that Justin Hayward is getting on in years, his voice holds up remarkably well (just remember, he isn't 25 anymore!) In addition, the small ensemble that he plays with leaves little room for error or vocal deficiencies. The performances are both intimate and honest and the picture and sound quality excellent. The choice of songs covers the Moody Blues and his solo work. The accompanying documentary gives a great insight into the preparation and effort that Justin and his band put into these small shows (all of his band are featured). As a fan of the Moodies for over 30 years (and having seem them live in Melbourne in the 1980s plus Justin's appearance in War of the Worlds in 2006), I would certainly recommend this disc to fellow fans: it is an up close and personal evening with a great songwriter, singer and guitarist.",1412035200,2,847,4.72972972972973

6444998,5,B00KS6ERUK,"Having followed the Moody Blues since they started playing, I have always gone out of my way to attend their concerts.  This was my first 'solo' Justin Hayward concert seen in upstate NY.  The DVD does a great job of capturing the concert, and includes one of the missing links at the concert... the keyboards.  Many times during the DVD the keyboards fill in the missing part of the rest of the band (sometimes with very heavy bass... somewhat mellotron-like).  I do miss the drums and other vocals on traditional Moody Blues material, but all in all this is an excellent concert, well recorded, and a nice addition to my collection of live shows. Even better, I got to see the Moody Blues Tour a few weeks after the Justin Hayward solo show!",1411344000,,743,4.56390977443609

6445001,5,B00KS6ERUK,"This is the most relaxed and enjoyable Justin Hayward live performance I have seen yet. The songs from his new solo album have all the hallmarks of his best compositions and the reworking of some of his Moody Blues classics are creative and fresh. The new guitar bridge for Nights is very nice and a real complement to the classic flute solos.

Of couple of the new songs show Hayward has not lost his knack for good songwriting. My favorite is In the Beginning with its romanticism. It cries to be a duet.

And the relaxed quality here showed up in the Moody Blues latest your. Justin notes during the video that the current Moodies line up is one the best he has experienced and it showed this summer at Ravinia. They looked and sounded like they could play another decade.",1411257600,,775,4.48936170212766

Both Alan and Julie are currently with The Moodies as well. The sound is a bit stripped down and works quite well as a result. There are quite a few standouts such as the medley of It's Up To You/Lovely To See You, The Land Of Make Believe, The Western Sky, New Horizons, One Day Someday and It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart. This is a really good performance and I really like the stripped down feel. I just hope Justin follows this up with a sequel doing other songs that don't appear here.",1410912000,4,682,4.464

6445014,5,B00KS6ERUK,"This DVD is a wonderful gift to anyone who has appreciated the extraordinary beauty of Justin Hayward's music, his voice, and his modest and gentile personality that belies what we often see from rock stars.  To many true Moodies fans, Hayward has always been the distinguishing contributor to their signature sound, but also not surprising to see his grateful references to the band during this solo performance.  Pure class.

I've had the chance to see the MBs numerous times, going back to my first concert as a kid just after the release of Question of Balance, but Justin's solo tours don't cover a lot of ground, so this is as close as many of us get.  As such, this DVD is a visual and aural feast.  It's a wonder to hear one of the great voices in rock and roll history project so clearly after almost 50 years of recording.

What's also notable is that Justin is still creating some of his most beautiful work, not just collecting a check for singing the old standards to a nostalgic group of boomers.  Quite the contrary.  While it is hard to exclude Nights in White Satin and Wildest Dreams from any set, the highlights are dreamy renditions of The Western Sky and The Eastern Sun from his recent release as well as acoustic versions of Land of Make Believe and Lovely to See You.  From the audience shots, it is clear that these fans appreciated the Justin they don't get to see when he's performing as one of the singers in a rock and roll band.

It has always been hard for me to understand how Hayward has not become more of an icon of rock and I hate to think it is because there is no news outside of the music.  But so be it as icon status would never be his goal anyway, and maybe good for us since he'd probably not be able to perform at such an intimate venue as he does here.  All we can hope is that he continues to take satisfaction and enjoyment from his work and keeps his solo gig going (maybe even schedule a swing through Kansas City).  I suspect history will eventually place Hayward in his rightful place among musicians of our era, notwithstanding the Hall of Fame's refusal to do so.",1409529600,5,2116,4.394871794871795
6445015,3,B00KS6ERUK,"If you want a concert DVD where you feel you're part of the audience and can sit back and relax while watching the concert, this may not be the right DVD for you.  The shots are constantly going from one angle to another.  Throughout the concert, every few seconds, another angle.  Even while Justin Hayward was talking, there was a constant switch.  I found the effects somewhat annoying and difficult to watch.  And the triple-vision and sideways shots of Mike Dawes were unnecessary and kind of cheesy.

The only fault I could see with the concert itself was when Your Wildest Dreams started.  It had the same loud, canned introduction as in Moody Blues concerts and didn't fit in with the rest of the mainly acoustic feel of the concert.  Maybe one more fault or maybe just a wish:  Id rather Mr. Hayward had done more of his solo songs and less Moody Blues songs.  We have Moody Blues concerts for those.

I will say though, the filmmaker did a much better job on the backstage part.

Seeing this DVD made me want to see and hear Justin Hayward solo in concert, not only for the performer and his music, but to experience his concert in a realistic, easy-going way, unlike this video.",1409529600,5,1189,4.530516431924883

This show has songs of the Moody Blues as well as some of the best songs from his solo album ""Spirits of the Western Sky"".  His voice is as rich as ever and he tells stories and even left in a blooper.  The behind the scenes portion is very interesting and shows what it's like to be on tour.

I gave him five stars because he's Justin Hayward and he sings with such passion some of the best songs ever written. As you said on PBS Justin, if music comes from the heart it's real and that's great! I believe this and I have seen this. The EQ on this though sounds like a policeman calling for someone to release the hostages through one of those I don't know what you call it bullhorns!! Justin, did you approve of this? Did you listen to this before it was released. And can other listeners concur with me on this or do I have something wrong with my ears! Again I give it a five star because it's just such great music, my favorite ever. The voice Sounds separate from the music rather than blended into it.",1408665600,,817,4.210191082802548

6445028,5,B00KS6ERUK,"If you are a Moody Blues fan, your favorite is probably Justin Hayward for good reason...he has the best voice of the group, and clearly has written the best songs....now comes is 2nd official solo release from his current and on-going tour....Compared to the San Juan Capistrano tour DVD (which I attended also) I will make the following statements:  The San Juan show has more songs and a little more of a diverse set list.  I also feel his backing band was better on the San Juan show because he had a tremendous bass player and drums, both of which were missing in this new release. But...this new ""Spirits Live"" in vastly superior in both audio and video quality.  This was shot in High-Def and is presented in Blu-ray format, the San Juan show is not.  This new release is also presented in sparkling DTS Master Audio, and is superior in every way to the San Juan show. Hayward is also in great voice on this new release, and the Master Audio really showcases that. My only real complaint is the band.  He shares guitar duties with a great player, but it's my opinion that he never gets to shine and is a bit buried in the mix, especially when he plays acoustic. He also has two keyboard players, one shines, and the other does not in my view.  I also really hated their arrangement on ""In your wildest dreams"" because of that.  I also missed him having a good back-up vocalist, but on the other hand nobody sings harmony with Justin better than John Lodge of the Moodies....But other than those small items, it is a great release of a truly great artist.  I just hope Justin continues to love playing and recording because he is truly a rare talent, and this DVD does showcase that.",1408579200,32,1689,4.478827361563518
6445029,5,B00KS6ERUK,"A Hungarian poet once said, In dreams and in love there are no impossibilities.  With the release of last years Spirits of the Western Sky and now Spirits Live, it appears Justin is at long last giving flight to his own whims and fancies.  And this new openness comes graced with charms and presented in the inimitable Hayward style.  Here is an artist still coming into his own at age 67.  The older songs played acoustically with softer edges are pleasing revelations.  The new compositions ache with poignancy.  On balance, Atlantas lovely Buckhead Theatre is the ideal venue for this performance of a classic and romantic set list, replete with raconteurial fillers, that transforms into a delicious parlor tte--tte.  The intimacy carries over to the behind-the-scenes documentary filmed between Alexandrias legendary Birchmere Music Hall and backstage snippets from Atlanta.  The three bonus tracks score the segment to a tee.  On The Road to Love could well have been the subtitle to last years album release; Suitcase from 1980s Night Flight iterates that yen for the road, the journey still beckoning; and, Troubadour from 1996s View From The Hill confesses to  a taste for the gypsy life and free horizons.  The Buckhead show is bookended, intro and reprise, by a lilting instrumental version of Captivated By You.  Choice selections all around!  This is a honey of a production.  Laid bare and stripped down, the currency is art, lofty musicality, warmth, humility, with an appealing dash of humor.  The busker at heart is pure genius.",1408492800,32,1545,5.051383399209486
6445030,5,B00KS6ERUK,"Most of Justin Hayward's songs are timeless. However, in this new DVD time has caught up to him and he finally looks his age. He has been the golden boy of love ballads since he was in his teens and now almost 70 his latest collection called Spirits of the Western Sky continues the saga. This DVD filmed at the Buckhead Theatre here in Atlanta contains most of the songs from this new album. If this collection  is autobiographical like some of his others, than love has not been too good to him lately. There is sadness and disappointment, lost love and some hope. The melodies are as good as ever and in this live performance we get a chance to see some of the other band members that are not ""officially"" Moodies but have been backing them up for many years. We were on both Moody Blues cruises this last April and the April before. I think this performance done in a small venue is better than the big theatre on the ship, much more intimate and I'm really sorry we missed it. The DVD  makes up for it.",1408492800,,1007,4.294736842105263
6445031,5,B00KS6ERUK,"I picked this up at Best Buy today and here are my thoughts.....

Very good show, intimate, don't expect the same scope and quality as the Greek Theatre Moodies BR. It actually was more appealing the second run through as I began to appreciate the different colors the small group brought to the songs as opposed to missing John Lodge and the gang.  In actuality just imitating the Moody Blues with a band would be boring and why film it?  This is a lovely ""in addition to""  and not an ""instead of"" purchase. This isn't a true ""unplugged"" affair, but it is primarily an acoustic night and that also is a plus for me.  The only slightly bum note is the 1 hour documentary which is really an extended behind the scenes of this one gig.... and for the most part a one time watch only.  If you view it as ""extra"" or simply a  bonus instead of looking forward to it as the highly touted tour documentary... you may be less disappointed.  As a long time fan I must say I'm thrilled to add this to my collection of MB and Justin Hayward films and I can't imagine anybody not enjoying this first rate show , which makes for a lovely (there's that word again) play in the living room on the big screen.",1408492800,19,1193,4.271111111111111
6445032,5,B00KS6ERUK,"Just watched it fully.  Very impressive!  I was at the San Francisco/Yoshi show.  The video quality is stunning in detail.  Purchase the Blu-Ray version if possible.

I really liked the option to change out the sound quality going from basic stereo to 7 channel DTS quality.

Especially enjoyable is the added 'Documentary' of the tour itself (city to city).

But beyond the video quality, the audio quality or the documentary itself, Justin Hayward has a voice like few.  He is amazing not only in that voice but with his guitars and his ability to make them sing out as well.

Excellent.  Really excellent...",1408406400,,610,4.834951456310679

8661131,5,B00KS6ERUK,"Classic Performance!
I have enjoyed this video to the max. The sound is perfectly clear. Being nearly all acoustic reveals layers of beautiful music often lost in Moody Blues discs.
Included are songs from 'Spirits of the Western Sky' and songs from Justin's previous solo discs plus many Moody's classics.

Miss the flute on certain songs, and would prefer less ""digial"" sounding keyboard sounds, but the guitar player and other musicians accompanying Justin on this are very good.
