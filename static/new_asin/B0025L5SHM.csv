8351114,4,B0025L5SHM,"This DVD contains a batch of the last cartoons made by the Van Beuren stubio in the early to mid 1930s.  This was the dawn of the cartoon shorts that played in movie houses until recently.  The first three cartoons on this set are Toddle Tand are in black and white- the rest of the cartoons  on this DVD are in color.  The quality of the transfers of these cartoons to this DVD are excellant.  At this time, there were several companies makig cartoon shorts for the motion picture companies.  Walt Disney won out and the other companies went broke.  Folks, these are not Disney studio cartoons and are not as good a quality as the Disney Studio was making in the mid 1930s.  The Toddle Tales are crude compared with The Disney cartoon of this era.  The Rainbow Parade cartoons are a big step up and are entertaining to watch.  I am glad I purchased this DVD and recommend it to those who want to see some cartoons from the dawn of the movie cartoon era.",1492560000,,954,4.338983050847458

8351119,5,B0025L5SHM,"To set this in perspective I'm now 70 + years old.  Back when I was a child in the 1940s I was introduced to Van Beuren cartoons by having them shown (on 16mm) at one of my birthday parties. Later in the 1950s these film became a staple of local (Philadelphia) children's television programming. Years later I purchased a 16mm rental library because it had a number of these films in it. Alas time has made these film too fragile to screen any longer.  This DVD solves that problem.

This set, from Thunderbean Animation, makes a good companion to the Image Entertainment set ""Cartoons That Time Forgot"" From The Ban Beuren Studio"". That set  includes the final 14 films made by the Van Beuren Studio. There were, however, 26 such films. The Rainbow Parade & Toddle Tales"" set includes those other 12 as well as three films from a short series called Toddle Tales. These films open with a live action segment which provides a prolog into the animated adventure. Like Van Beuren's earlies Aesop's Fables series, each of these film carries a ""moral"" but unlike the earlier series, it is not spelled out in text during the end credits.

As with other products from Thunderbean Animation Steve Stanchfield, includes a wealth of bonus features in this set. These span character development art, marketing materials, an on-screen essay about the Van Beuren studio, and even a music only version of one of the films.

This set is highly recommended not just for the content but for the care Thunderbean has demonstrate in preserving these  films.",1343692800,17,1539,4.784905660377358
8351120,5,B0025L5SHM,"This DVD, unlike so many others of early animation, was obviously put together by people who love it. It contains the best print I have ever seen of ""Sunshine Makers"" and is worth the price for that alone. Not all the source prints in the collection are equally pristine but that is to be expected. The authoring and transfers are far above most of the other collections I have purchased.",1332892800,5,388,4.557142857142857
8351121,4,B0025L5SHM,"After years of fumbling efforts (available on DVD also) the Van Beuren studio spent it's last years in the hands of Burt Gillett, director of The 3 Little Pigs at Disney. Gillett was more suited to one-shot cartoons, and his tempermental personality didn't help matters. His cartoons are in lush color, but they lack the surreal qualities of earlier Van Beuren efforts. Disney imitators were doomed to failure, and Van Beuren failed quickly. Thunderbean has done a terrific job finding the best available prints and packaging them attractively. They have issued most of Van Beuren's cartoon output on DVD, and here's hoping they do them all.",1271116800,8,641,5.056603773584905
8351122,5,B0025L5SHM,"Back in 1999 Image entertainment released a disc called ""The Cartoons That Time Forgot - The Van Beuren Studio. This covered essentially the last release season of the studio's existence, 1935-36, and encompassed all of the 3 strip Technicolor ""Rainbow Parade"" cartoons. The DVD release was largely through the efforts of Dave Shepard who had access to all of the 35mm ""Commonwealth"" materials , the film company which purchased these films upon the studios demise. Unfortunately the previous seasons 13 ""two color"" Technicolor releases went to the ""Walter Gutlohn"" company who released them for a brief period of time in 16mm Cinecolor form. These 35mm source materials have never been found, and are generally considered ""Lost"".

Having already produced two excellent DVD releases covering the Van Beuren studio's preceding series, those featuring ""Cubby Bear"", and ""The Little King"", Thunderbean Animation has now moved into this transitional Van Beuren film period, featuring cartoon films produced by animation legends Burt Gillett and Ted Eshbaugh. An arduous project, Steve Stanchfield reports that it took over four years to collate and transfer scarce 16mm Cinecolor and b/w films to complete this DVD!

In 1933 studio owner Amedee Van Beuren, dissatisfied with his overall position in the cartoon short films market, brought in producer Burt Gillett, whose real claim to fame was being the director of ""The Three Little Pigs"", Walt Disney's biggest cartoon hit up to that time. Of equal importance was Van Beuren's additional hiring of Ted Eshbaugh, whom was one of the earliest animation producers to film in color. Eshbaugh had most recently produced a pilot film for a series of ""Wizard of Oz"" cartoons, which he pitched to the MGM studio brass in 1933.  The company passed, opting instead to hire former Disney animators, Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising, who had produced sound cartoons for Leon Schlesinger and Warner Brothers during the previous three seasons.

Van Beuren believed that if his studio was to remain competitive, it needed to keep pace with the majors by moving into color cartoon production. Eshbaugh obviously had the experience in this field, and his first film in the newly christened ""Rainbow Parade"" series was ""Pastry town Wedding"". A predecessor to Disney's later ""Cookie Carnival"", the setting is in an imaginary bakery where little baker folk happily churn out scrumptious delicacies, to celebrate one of their chum's wedding. Eshbaugh followed up this innocuous entry with a much more visually striking title ""Japanese Lanterns"". Unfortunately, of the 13 Rainbow Parade titles released this year, this was the only one to elude Thunderbean in color form, so it is presented here in its ""Offical Films"" b/w version. (However it is noted in the DVD that the UCLA archive is in the process of restoring a 35mm print, possibly the only one in existence). But, this detriment is more than made up for by the third (and last) Eshbaugh directed short, ""The Sunshine Makers"", probably the best known and appreciated title of the entire Rainbow Parade series. Sourced from a restored 35mm print licensed from Lobster Films of France. This restoration blows away any version you've ever seen of the ""Sunshine"" gnomes and their epic battle with the ""Gloomies""! (Please see the screen caps with the listing)

Unfortunately Eshbaugh left the Van Beuren studio after completion of this cartoon, although it's readily apparent he was involved in the initial designs of ""Picnic Panic"" and ""Spinning Mice"", given the many similarities in character design and personality animation. The reasons for Eshbaughs departure are not specifically documented, but it is known that Burt Gillett was not an easy man to work with or for, and it is certainly possible that there was more than a little professional ""rub"".

Gillett's first productions for Van Beuren were for a b/w series which was called ""Toddle Tales"". These were cartoon hybrids , based around live action footage of cute children antics book ending morality tales as told in animation form. Seen today they are charmingly nostalgic curios, but they also belie a certain strangeness. A prime example can be seen in the first title to be released, ""Grandfather's Clock"". Here live action footage of a painted human clock face escounced inside a wooden case is used to scold two little children who are playing too hard with a bedside alarm clock. He then tells a tale of a happy clock land where little clocks go to school, and play football during recess. Has to be seen to be believed! Two more of these titles were also released, ""Along came a Duck"" and ""A Little Bird Told Me"". The series was apparently not well received, and Gillett may have reasoned this was because, as imaginative as they were, they needed color to really put the concept over. Two subsequent titles ""Spinning Mice"" and the delightful ""Picnic Panic"", continued with live action intro sections, bfore the concept was finally discontinued. Thereafter Gillett concentrated on featuring re-occuring characters, most likely trying to establish a starring character.

First up was a series featuring the inhabitants of ""Parrotville"" whom had appeared originally in Gillets first Van Beuren color cartoon ""Parrotville Fire Department"". Next, a series of cartoons featuring 3 mischievous kittens was tried out. This concept may have been brought with Gillett from Disney, as production of a ""Three Little Kittens"" cartoon was underway before he left. ""Merry Kittens"" and ""The Rag Dog"" both had the kittens tormenting their canine counterparts to fairly high extremes. Gillett then tried out a bovine lead, (later dubbed Molly Moo Cow) who first appeared as the antagonist in ""Picnic Panic"". ""The Hunting Season"" moves her into a more heroic role protecting her forest animal friends. This was the only regular character to carry over into the next season, and it does cause one to speculate if Gillett really had the patience (or ability!) to develop a star character. Certainly Van Beuren was concerned, as he purchased the film rights for Felix the Cat, and ""The Toonerville Trolley"" soon after.

Another obvious detriment was that Disney had a contractual lock on the new  3-Strip Technicolor process.  The best system Van Beuren had available was the older two color technology, (meaning blue and orange are the primary colors) and this limitation also indirectly contributed to the current scarcity of these titles on color filmstock. Cinecolor is a double emulsion stock meaning it is applied to both sides of the base element and is subject to twice the wear points of a one sided element. Accordingly they are more easily damaged, and simply wear out faster. This is readily apparent on a few of the titles we see in this collection. In the liner notes Steve Stanchfield mentions that to present these cartoons in their best possible state he often had to use various parts of different prints for each title.

All in all this is a fascinating collection of very RARE golden age cartoons. That it took four years to put these all together is not surprising, considering their checkered history.  Like most chronological DVD compendiums there are a few clunkers, but most of these are quite entertaining. And you will never find a nicer version of the Sunshine Makers anywhere else! It's worth the purchase price to have this restoration alone!  Highly Recommended!",1239321600,38,7415,5.123242349048801
