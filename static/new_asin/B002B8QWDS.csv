8360833,4,B002B8QWDS,"With 1951's TARZAN'S PERIL, RKO producer Sol Lesser strived to snag back a smidge of the prestige - that was long associated with the early MGM Tarzan pictures - by lensing chunks of background footage in Africa. And, yeah, it worked. We hadn't seen such reputable production values since Maureen O'Sullivan was around classying up the set. I was having fits of MGM nostalgia eyeballing that jagged train of poor porters traversing the jungle and scaling the mountainside.

TARZAN'S PERIL is Lex Barker's third outing as the ape-man, and, I have to say it, it's also the third movie in a row in which he gets clubbed on the head from behind. Where's them sharp animal reflexes, bro? This time out, Tarzan shows up 15 minutes into the movie and goes up against white gunrunners who arm the aggressive Yorango tribe so that its vile chief, Bulam (Frederick O'Neal), can crush the more peaceful neighboring Ashuba tribe. See, it's a case of a guy who got spurned by a woman he coveted. When Bulam interjects himself into the joyful coronation of the Ashuba tribe's young new queen, Melmendi (Dorothy Dandridge), and proposes and gets harshly rejected, well, he ain't havin' that, no, sir!

Virginia Huston, with her suburban housewife coiffure, is our Jane of the month, and she looks fresh out of the cover of a 1950s issue of Better Homes & Gardens - what, do they have a posh beauty salon in Randini? But when it comes to who exudes sheer sexy in this motion picture, it's not even close. Every time she was onscreen, Dorothy Dandridge palpitated my heart. And I liked her acting, too, her portrayal of a sweet yet spunky young jungle queen who simply will not back down to bullies.

But it's George Macready who hijacks the show. He chews such scenery and plays such a dastardly heavy with such a reptilian gaze, I'm a bit surprised his scenes don't come with a boo track. Radijeck (Macready) is burdened by an almighty grudge. He's escaped from prison and he's looking to get even with those who sent him up the river. This includes local British East Africa commissioner Peters (Alan Napier) who is about to retire after having pretty successfully kept guns and gin off his territory for thirty years. And this includes Tarzan who captured Radijeck. So, there goes Radijeck, stirring the pot.

It's got its fair share of action. Tarzan is a handful. But, really, I couldn't get enough of Macready as Radijeck, he's so unapologetically malevolent. His best scene isn't the one where he mows down two innocent men or when he sneakily pushes a boulder down to take out a feisty partner-in-crime or when he clubs the ape-man from behind. No, the best - and most hilarious - scene is when he busts in on Jane in the tree house and proceeds to wolf down her meal while wide-eyed ranting away.

Last thing, and it's a nitpick. There's a side-plot introduced concerning an ""unidentified foreign government out to destroy established authority"" as read by Jane in Commissioner Peters' confidential journal. Except this never plays out in the movie. Oh, well, it's still a fun matine movie.",1526688000,,3083,4.755140186915888
8360834,4,B002B8QWDS,Good adventure movie well directed by Byron Haskin. Lex Barker is fine Tarzan. Dorothy Dandridge is exciting as the Queen.,1483228800,,122,5.15
8360835,3,B002B8QWDS,"Lex Barker is a decent Tarzan, Virginia Hudson needed a little work, but managed to work through it. This doesn't have the grandeur of the original Tarzans with Johnny Weissmuller, but it was good. It had the bad guys who were obviously very bad and the peace loving folks, not enough Jungle action which was surprising and very little animals came to the aid of the Lord of the Jungle.",1482192000,,386,4.5285714285714285
8360836,4,B002B8QWDS,"I love all things Tarzan,so I'm really not the person to give an honest,unbiased review. Having said that,this was a good,but typical movie. I did enjoy Jock Mahoney's Tarzan very much. And seeing(a very young) Sean Connery in a villainous role was extra fun. Enjoy!",1435017600,,266,4.933333333333334

8360838,4,B002B8QWDS,"Tarzan's Peril,  reminiscent of the first six Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies, sparkles. The natives were black, dances were wonderful and Dorothy Dandridge was captivating. George Macready was evil, which was to be expected. After all, that is what they pay him for. Believe it or not Lex Barker fills Johnny Weissmuller's loincloth quite nicely.",1411171200,,348,5.444444444444445
8360839,4,B002B8QWDS,"In this 1951 fifteenth Tarzan film, the third in which Lex Barker plays the famed jungle hero, the rather simple plot seems a lot like those found in its predecessors, but it is still fun to watch. However, unlike some other Tarzan films, blacks play the natives, and not Caucasians. Cheetah, as usual adds to the humor in the movie.

A tribe elects a queen who assures the white commissioner that her people have no guns. During the inauguration ceremony, the leader of a rival tribe offers to make her his wife. She rejects him with strong language. White men bring guns to the rival tribe. They attack the queen's people and overcome them. Tarzan swings through the trees and saves them.",1310860800,3,690,4.655737704918033
8360840,3,B002B8QWDS,"Only beautiful Dorothy Dandridge and handsome Lex Barker in his flapping micro-mini skirt make this film worth watching.  Sparks fly in their brief scenes alone but Hollywood was too racist in the 50's to let nature take its course, so Plain Jane gets the beef.",1266105600,5,261,4.8
8360841,4,B002B8QWDS,"While I always liked this movie, I want to know why the best Tarzan movies ever made, The Gordon Scott color Tarzan movies, specifically, ""Tarzan's Greatest Adventure"" and ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" as well as Jock Mahoney's ""Tarzan Goes to India"" and ""Tarzan's Three Challenges"" have not been released on DVD? It has been acknowledged among those who have a lot of movie knowledge this these were generally the best Tarzan movies ever made and if they were ever to be released on DVD (Blu-Ray please?) they would make the companies who put them out a fortune. While I recorded these movies off of AMC when they had their Tarzan movie marathon about 14 years ago, I would still love to have cleaned up, improved sound and all the extras they could hold DVDs of these movies, as I am sure many others would. So who is in charge of all this? Are you listening? I hope so.",1257638400,4,867,4.528662420382165
8360842,3,B002B8QWDS,"Before I review this edition of ""Tarzan's Peril"", let me give you all the negatives; the Warner Archive Collection at the WB site sells this title for nearly $6 less than Amazon; there are no special features, subtitles, nor even a scene index; the encrypting process prevents this DVD from playing on any DVD player with recording capabilities (which means you probably won't be able to play this on your PC).

While the Lex Barker 'Tarzan' films were run frequently on TV in the 1950s and 1960s, his third, ""Tarzan's Peril"" was only rarely aired, as the film is certainly the most brutal and violent of all his outings! Foreshadowing Gordon Scott's seminal ""Tarzan's Greatest Adventure"", the story, of Tarzan's manhunt of a ruthless killer he'd initially helped capture, has the novelty of some location scenes shot in Africa, and the added pleasure of the legendary Dorothy Dandridge in one of her rare screen appearances, as the young queen of a beleagered tribe. Sinister George Macready (""Gilda"") is certainly a worthy adversary for Tarzan, with motives of revenge against both Tarzan and Jane (Virginia Huston, a voluptuous actress with a 50s hairdo, in her only 'Tarzan' appearance). Other notables in the cast include Alan (""Alfred"") Napier, in his second Barker outing, this time as a retiring jungle commissioner; veteran actor Douglas Fowley, as Macready's bearded, gunrunning partner; and Frederick O'Neal as the chubby, sleazy ruler of the tribe warring against Dandridge.

The film is unrepentent in it's bloodletting (even Cheeta gets in the act!), and isn't one I'd share with younger children without being present to explain the context. While it deserves credit for offering a bit more reality than previous Barker outings (with black tribes, for a change), some stereotyping is also present.

All in all, a most unusual entry in Lex Barker's 'reign' as the Ape Man!",1252022400,2,1886,5.097087378640777
