1069094,5,6305755175,"It is good to see the powers that be in the DVD world are not ignoring classical music. I have been wanting to see Horowitz material reissued in the new format and I was not disappointed.

Comparing the DVD to my LaserDisc, I find that the video portion is somewhat superior on DVD, with improved clarity and contrast. The sound is also better. There are two audio versions, the original non-compressed stereo, and a new Dolby Digital 5.1 track which will knock your socks off. If you have a DVD player, this disc is a must, if you haven't purchased a player yet, this is incentive to get one!

Unlike the Pioneer DVD release, this Sony release contains Horowitz's final encore, Rachmaninoff's Polka VR.

Now, how about putting the other Horowitz videos on DVD?",1115164800,65,761,4.664179104477612
1069095,5,6305755175,"It was not easy for Horowitz to make a fame inthe wakeof the Golden Age to become one of the greats and at his late age admitted that he had a limited musical background.

In this DVD, however, don't expect to see any of the fiery or scary perfomances like his Rachmaninov Concerto No. 3 or his Metropolitan Recital. He had long passed that stage, both in  age and in fame. Instead, viewers are compensated with a fuller view of his subtle colours which he pushed to an utmost extreme, a revelation for many modern piano players. We also have some most heartfelt pieces by Horowitz however short they may be. Moreover, we can have sight of Tsaichovsky's home and his piano where the Maestro played a few phrases on it. We see what comes of Horowitz's rather colourless niece left behind in Russia. We also see the actual weeping of the Russians, invoked by Horowitz's playing, lamenting perhaps also their own unnecessary turns and twists in the face of Communism...

Having been listening to this for years, I still find it a source of inspiration, albeit as far as music or the ingenuity of fixing the repertoire, Horowitz's ""Concert in Vienna"", filmed at about the same time, is even more appealing. Both are oozing with colours. But for a closer look at his fingers and touches, viewers should instead check out  ""Horowitz, The Last Romantic.""

All in all, Horowitz by this stage surely would be able to win back Lipatti's admiration, if not Kopcsis's.",1066348800,7,1456,4.694117647058824
1069096,5,6305755175,"I have the VHS format of this magnificient recital.  You will be hard pressed to see and hear better versions of Scarlatti and Mozart.  In viewing this video you sense that there is something special in the air.  The master returns to his homeland one last time and leaves a SUPERB recital for us to cherish.
I am not musically trained and therefore probably missed some of the intricate aspects of the recital.  Even if you are one of those that occasionally dabbles in classical music, get this video.  I found the audience interaction, yes coughing, quite genuine and moving.  To see a great artist perform in his homeland and see the audience reactions, faces, and emotions, makes this a truly memorable performance.
Can you believe that I found this jewel perchance in the dollar bin at a video store in 1999?  I am told this is now available in DVD.  Excellent!",1051315200,5,867,4.657894736842105
1069097,5,6305755175,"Musical Content: Horowitz still surprises me every time I listen to him playing great 'solo' piano works as in this concert, (beautiful ones from Scarlatti, The Rach, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Liszt, Schumman, Scriabin). His magic finger-style was just incredible, so if you are Horowitz fan this is a must-have, there's no reason to keep you from buying a DVD player and experience the way our beloved Horowitz 'utilize' his unique piano (you see, I just don't want to call him pianist).
Sound Quantity: This DVD has pretty good sounding managed by Deustche Gramophone, but the problem came from the audience, it might be heavily cold in Moscow that attendants couldn't help coughing during the performance, and because DG want to keep the sound as natural as possible you will hear at least two annoying coughs in each section of the show. Fortunately, Horowitz was not distracted by that (or it's not perceivable) & as always he was part of the works he's playing.
Video Quantity: the picture quantity of the DVD is quite good, but the view angle should be much better, the camera man does not give us the feeling of vitually attending the performance (theatre atmosphere is unreasonably narrow), he also got incredible mistake when spending maybe half of the time focusing on Horowitz left hand.
Other content on the DVD: There are two interviews with Horowitz, they are about some of his unforgettable memories in Russia, and they are fun & very memorable.
Also, there's brief Horowitz biography, which I found it very concise & should
be particularly impressive for people who are not very familiar with Horowitz.
As a conclusion I highly recommend this DVD to buy as gift for piano/classical music newbies, they will not pay much attention to the weakness of it but will have wonderful time experiencing one of the most successful shows performed by Horowitz.",1010448000,11,1861,4.967948717948718
1069098,5,6305755175,"This DVD is truly amazing. I would give this a better rating than ""The Last Romantic"" Because the last romantic focuses too much on his face and other angles. This DVD shows his fingers at the perfect angle. You really get a close-up view of how effortless Horowitz makes these pieces look.
A bit of warning, Horowitz makes many mistakes during the Polonaise (Op. 53 ""Heroic""), But the playlist is overall very good. One of the variations in the Schubert Impromptu (Op. 142 No. 3) is, in my opinion, done quite badly by Horowitz.
This is an absolute must-have DVD if you enjoy watching the pianist's fingers and playing technique. Excellent performance. I hope more DVD's like this are released!",1010016000,3,695,4.8
1069099,5,6305755175,"I have seen this DVD time and again and it is never boring, always full of new details and undiscovered charm and power. It is pure joy to see diversity of Mr Horowitz repertoire, his flawless technique, those fingers, those amazing octaves that barely touch the keys and yet produce such incredible sounds.
Horowitz's body expression, that simplicity of movements without the affectation of so many pedantic pianists is a great lesson to those who think that flamboyance is needed to convey a musical message. Yet, with those limited movements, Horowitz is able to deliver something so profound that only music in the hands of a great artist can. The interviews to Horowitz are fun, illustrative of his life while showing the human side of a great artist. May be a bit too much time was devoted to showing the audience although this was quite a sight at certain moments. I wish the camera had shown his hands during the whole execution of Schumann's ""Traeumerei"".  Buy this DVD and you will never, ever regret it.",988675200,5,1014,4.7942857142857145

Two minor caveats, Horowitz' final encore, Rachmaninoff's  Polka, which was included in the VHS versions, is not present, as it was  not in the Laserdisc issued by the same company.

He's playing for his audience, an audience starved of his genius for far too long. The emotional release is almost too much to bear! I teared up several times as Horowitz makes a sacred connection with his audience. A connection that goes beyond technique or even artistry.  This is a deeply personal, organic recital; a statement of forlorn exuberance.  Motivated by years away from his homeland, Horowitz pours his soul into the piano and to the audience, to profound effect.

1069195,5,6305755175,"When this performance originally aired in 1986, I recorded it in VHS tape format.  I watched it many times over the years, until our VHS player finally ""bit the dust"" in 2004.  I was sad, at that time, that a DVD version was not available.  I had forgotten to look for it on DVD until recently.

I was so excited to find this disc!  The picture and sound quality are GREAT!  I have already watched Mr. Horowitz's performance 3 times since the DVD arrived.  His playing is amazing, just as I recall.  Just to sit and watch his fingers fly over the keys, or gently caress them, is sublime.  I remember each song, as if it were yesterday.

As with the original show, it was also very interesting to see his family, and to hear his comments about his life and the concert.  Thank you for including these portions along with the actual concert.  I'll enjoy this for many years to come!  For anyone who ever saw this program, I would recommend this DVD highly.

It is a privilege to be able to watch Horowitz play these pieces. The incredible technique and control he had is breathtaking. As a pianist I am awed. As a human being you can appreciate how he bridged the differences between two countries at the tail end of the cold war with the beauty of his playing. During the Schumann piece there is a brief scene where an elderly man in the audience is shown with his eyes closed and tears streaming down his cheek. I think that, more than anything, can sum up this DVD and Horowitz. That a man can make music this beautiful makes you feel optimistic for the potential of the human race again. It really is that inspiring. I also appreciate the excellent sound quality. An all around excellent purchase.",1292457600,2,916,4.491017964071856
1069262,5,6305755175,"This is a marvelous insight into a concert of the greatest pianist of our time at the age of 83.  It is remarkable how well he plays in the beginning, and everything he plays is from memory.

Yet with all my admiration, I assign this performance more a sentimental value than the true virtuoso one;  in a way, it is a sad recording, because it is noticeable of how tired maestro becomes towards the end, not able to hide the mistakes;  it is somewhat disheartening to see him making a tremendous effort, yet the keys seem not to obey him as they did 20 years before.  I think he was unhappy that he could not play flawlessly and could not control his own inability.  It must have been deeply frustrating for Horowitz to play with clearly heard errors.

I suspected that many would assign people's tears during Schumann's ""Traumerei"" to the artistry of Horowitz playing.  The truth is that whenever someone important in USSR died, the radio would endlessly play this music.  It has become so closely associated with death; and during the concert those shedding tears were probably recalling the losses of someones dear to them, reacting as Pavlov's dog to this tune.  Of course, Horowitz plays it masterfully, but this is not why people in the audience were crying.

It is actually quite interesting to see the attendees of the performance; the tickets were definitely distributed by unions, given as rewards to exemplary workers, as to USSR Army officers that one can see in the sala,  party bosses, young communist leaders, etc, - in short, to all those who had never attended a classical music concert before in their entire life.  Moscow Conservatory concerts were normally half-empty, but Horowitz was so exotic and notorious - a former emigrant, a suspect, in a way.  Viewers should not take what they see by face value and imagine that everyone in USSR knew and loved Horowitz; those who defected to the West were never viewed favorably from within mother Russia.
But for this visit Horowitz was ordered to be celebrated and loved.  I am sure he felt some falseness in all that.

To anyone who is familiar with his life story, and who had similar experiences in life, this video is full of nostalgic moments.  It is hard to say what Horowitz really experienced during this visit.  Stravinsky years before cut his visit short.  For a Russian emigrant who left because he could not stay it is never so easy and pleasant to be back, and I think Maestro's anguish after his sixty one years of absence shows - not when he is playing, but in the off-stage settings.

This is somewhat a very emotional film; more than a concerto.  Recommended with care.",1287619200,3,2652,4.696969696969697
1069263,5,6305755175,"This was an astounding event. The CBS special was watched by millions. This DVD gives us the chance to watch again and again the connection of Horowitz, his Russian audience and his piano.

I listen to Maestro Horowitz's recordings of Chopin Etudes daily, as his crystalline clear, well-articulated fast phrases on works such as the Revolutionary Etude, the Black Key Etude, etc. really set him apart from his peers. Hi succinctness and dynamite interpretations are second to none. I also love his recording of Chopin's Military Polonaise. I use his recordings a lot in my own piano-playing to grasp the interpretative genius from Maestro Horowitz.

1069329,5,6305755175,"I agree this is one of the best concert films around. Horowitz is in fine form, and his playing is fittingly masterful. His Scarlatti's the sparkling best moment in the program; the Mozart won't be for everybody, although I never get why that is, if you Listen. Horowitz chooses smaller, personal pieces, fending off autumnal aspects with characteristic elan, but clearly a man profoundly moved by playing once again in Russia. This is the Russian charism, always returning; Horowitz embodies it body and soul in this film. A brilliant energy of Reunion blasts every frame and ends a cut above the ordinary concert document. In the Russian way, in the end, what's left unsaid makes the profoundest sound. Horowitz isn't a pianist for everybody; he was annoying as hell at times, even when pointing a way deep into music. He foiled himself time and again as an artist; but then, who's to say. There remain lessons of humanity in his art; if more is asked, nothing more can be expected of an artist. This most ardent Horowitz film is in a class by itself. Proceed without fear.",1142035200,4,1075,4.754010695187166
1069330,5,6305755175,"My reviews of these violinists and this pianist are becoming redundant.  The performers are all so good, that I'm reduced to admiration and have little else to say.  I remember many years ago I was listening to NPR, they had a female musical expert on and they were testing her, they had both Rubinstein and Horowitz play something by Chopin, she was supposed to identify the pianist.  She guessed wrong both times.  I guessed right.  I thought at the time that Rubinstein was the supreme player of Chopin, and I thought the Horowitz version was cold.  This was many years ago, and while I still prefer Rubinstein's Chopin (warmer), Horowitz is my hero, my favorite pianist, though I'm not nuts about his customary choices of composers.  But this flick.  It is a perfect gem (and so tragically underpriced, anyone can afford it).  The drama of the arrival, Horowitz' conversation, the shots of the audience (some of whom, yes, were crying), the marvelous close-ups of his hands (his nails were unclipped and seemed to be dirty, and he doesn't arch his fingers which my very dim and distant piano teacher used to tell me was imperative, though he does it some on the right hand), and the music.  It was glorious.  I love Horowitz.  One glitch.  There would be.  My disc was defective, and somewhere during the penultimate piece it screwed up, so I didn't get to see the whole thing, I missed the last 2 pieces of music and whatever dramatic or ""human interest"" ending was on the film.  But good old Amazon is already getting ready to ship me a replacement and tonight I returned the defective copy.  I'll have the new one in 2 days.  One last note.  I've been going broke the passed few weeks buying musical performances on DVD, and one thing I've noticed, it's unmistakable.

1069331,5,6305755175,"I own the original videotape of ""Horowitz in Moscow"" and ""Horowitz in London.""  Both are wonderful (5 stars each), but ""Horowitz in Moscow"" is extraordinary.  It's like two DVDs in one. You get great personal insight into the life of Horowitz, particularly about his emotional return to Russia after a 60 year absence.  This ""return"" -- a running theme in the lives of displaced Russian pianists who fled to the West, like Horowitz and Rachmaninov -- sets the emotional tone for the Russian recital (and encores) marvelously.  One cares about Horowitz more and hopes to hear great performances.  The grand master delivers.  On the DVD you will find several Scarlatti, Scriabin, Rachmaninov, and countless other gems.  Pianists tend to age well.  It's not uncommon to see a seventy or eighty year old pianist wobble to the piano (one wonders if they will get there without collapsing), sit down shakily, and explode into a wonderful performance that is at least 85-90% of their best ever.  Sometimes, an older pianist playing a piece that requires greater musical understanding and maturity -- and is less taxing technically -- will play the piece even better than in their youth.  You get much of the latter on this DVD.  Horowitz's fingers were so remarkable in his youth that the grand master's 90% is another's 150%.  There is no meltdown of skill here.  This is a virtuoso at his prime, at times excelling his youthful performances of Scriabin, Scarlatti, and others.  No musical library is complete without this DVD.

7894387,5,6305755175,"To go into the historical, musical, social and political signifigance of Vladimir Horowitz's return to Russia back in '86 is a bit redundant by now, so I'll focus on the actual content of the DVD. You get the whole concert, including a few pieces not on the Grammy winning album. Plus a little bit of a look at Horowitz and his wife as they got ready to depart for the Soviet Union, and some nice chit-chat moments, including a great moment visiting with the daughter of Alexander Scriabin. As for the concert itself, I have to admit that Horowitz did not give one of his best concerts musically (he misses a note here and there, plus I never liked that Mozart sonata), but that meant nothing to the audience. They just wanted to see him and know that he had come home. On a recent reviewing, I was really struck by how drab and grey the whole event seemed. People must have saved for God knows how long to be able to attend the concert. The recital starts out tentative, naturally, but the enthusiasm warms up as it went along. Plus Horowitz had that handkerchief after every single ovation! And, of course, the most famous moment: a single trickling tear during Schumann's Traumerai. I think that just might be worth the entire price of the DVD.
  This DVD does exclude the original intros by CBS legend Charles Kurault, so fans of his will probably miss that. But you get the concert as it was way back when. The definition of the term ""musical event"". ---------------------------------PEACE
