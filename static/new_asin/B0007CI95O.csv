2208312,5,B0007CI95O,"I have purchased this set of tapes from HSN, a while ago and I am glad that I did. Yes, it does sound and look funny...but it worked for me and countless other losers of inches. I used to do the weights and cardio thing. Now, I'd rather BodyFlex, etc. I encourage everyone to read Greer's book: Be A Loser!, for it explains how BodyFlex works. Thanks Greer for sharing your BodyFlex workout with us, for it has changed my life and others as well!",1145145600,38,446,4.258823529411765

YOu'll want to watch it with friends and co-workers after a stressful day at the office. You can't participate because you're too busy being in hysterics--the gasping, butterfly, ""Lion Face"" and ""Ugly Face"" are among my favorites. I'd suggest it to ANYONE. Great ""Party Favor"". Perfect '80's item to remember the good ole days.",1134518400,8,493,4.951807228915663

2208316,4,B0007CI95O,"I have had the set, currently have the first vhs tape.  Like most vhs, it's not that useful, and it was never designed as a real-time workout to be played daily.  It's a set of instructions on how to do the breathing (without repeats), and instruction on how to do each position, without repeats, and then instructions to make your own program by doing 10 breaths each day, followed by five breaths in each of the facial positions, and your choice of any three positions, 10 repeats each.

Mine came with a reminder card showing the positions.

So after watching the tape once or twice, and taking notes, you do this all on your own without the tape.  Currently you can google Body Flex and get the entire youtube instruction for the breathing, about 5 minutes, and a second link to a 23 minute youtube of the positions.  These are straight from the videotape.",1445904000,9,860,4.5519480519480515

2208319,5,B0007CI95O,"Did this years ago and had fantastic results..(1999)  I must admit I was skeptical..  but I am also lazy and this program seemed 'easier' than traditional workouts so lazy won out over skeptical and I gave it a try..  Combined with a low carb diet I went from a size 16 to a size 6 in one month.. then I got complacent and the weight crept back on over the years.. Now.. it's 2015 and I am still completely uninterested in gyms and cross fit type exercises I have dusted the tapes back off, bought a VHS player at the thrift store and am back to the body flexing and seeing the same great results.. Sounds weird and looks silly but NOTHING and I mean nothing works as well for me. Most of the negative reviews are not from people actually doing the program by the way..  I love Body Flex and consider it my secret weapon.. You must do it correctly and consistently to see the amazing and rapid results.  I also walk a few miles a day and stick with a low carb way of eating and am losing weight and inches and toning up in places that haven't seen 'tone' in 10 years..",1422057600,20,1068,4.165048543689321

It truly does give you more energy. Every day I wish I would have kept up with it but I didn't but I will be walking proof of this product  and I have recomended many people to use this because it works I will put this out there for many years to come. Just wish it was on dvd.people she may look funny but it definitely works and its definitely the best purchase you could ever make if you want to lose inches and maybe weight I don't know all I lnow is I went down7 size in a short period of time.

2208326,5,B0007CI95O,"My mother brought this product back when I was 8th grade. She committed to the beginners part workout for about 2 months. She is a woman who loves to eat main courses and dessert, but she kept up with the exercise program. After a month or so, her co-workers would compliment on how much weight she has lost and she never dieted or did any extra exercise programs--- just this!!

Ten years later after I had my first child I was considered morbidly obese according to my BMI. I had no time in my schedule to go to a gym class or go running or jogging so I said what the heck just give this body flex program a shot!

I would like to add that when I started this program, I checked my blood pressure and blood glucose. Both were alarming borderline bad ranges and a little over the normal limits!!! I knew I had to do something! I started cutting out any processed foods from diet and made sure I drunk at least 10 glasses (8oz each) of water a day. All other foods like chicken, steak, and rice were very hard to stay away from and I still could not really help my portion intake. Even after all that I still stuck with the body flex program one session a day everyday!

Now for the amazing part! After only one month Ive lost 6 inches off my waist and belly area alone! I DID NOT DO ANY OTHER EXERCISES OR CUT BACK ON CALOIES! I did not lose much or any inches anywhere else but Im not complaining about my midsection in the least!! I also had my blood pressure and glucose measured and BOTH were at the NORMAL ranges!! I was ecstatic!! So many of my in-laws kept commenting on how much weight Ive lost and how fantastic I looked. One in-law approached me and said exactly this, I wanted to tell you this when we were in private but I just couldn't wait. You look great! You must feel great! Honestly, after all the compliments I received of how much weight Ive lost, my scale number did not budge not one bit from my beginning weight. Many body flex users have said that its important to pay attention to the tape measurements rather than the scale. This is because you are building lean and toned muscles and muscles weight more than fat. I would recommend this program to anyone!

When you first watch the video and listen to Geers concept, it really does not make sense how simple breathing can cause dramatic results. But it does! And if you do it correctly, it can work for you! Also, you might laugh at the breathing technique at first and especially at the facial exercises. But those exercises have gained me tremendous amounts of compliments of how weight Ive lost in my face alone! Once you get over the laughing part you can begin to workout with ease!",1393545600,20,2665,4.313373253493014
2208327,4,B0007CI95O,"I really like this video, but I so wish it would come out on a DVD - the tape wears out if you use it every day, and it is starting to blur and jump - the thing about these exercises though, they really do work, if you are vigilant and do it every single day - if it ever does appear on a DVD, I will definitely get it.",1384214400,11,319,3.5714285714285716

2208332,5,B0007CI95O,"I have been using these tapes since the 90's off and on. Every time I exercise to these the results are dramatic and exactly what I want.  People are always asking me Wow! you look fantastic what are you doing? The best is that there is no dieting, it's easy, you have tons of energy and you just feel overall better about yourself. I'm in my forties now and this is my go to exercise program. I usually am a size 6 but have been a size 2 when I wanted to be that thin. I do eat healthy so I know that helps but desserts are never skipped because of a diet plan. Just do the exercises and you'll see what I mean about quick results. I never weigh myself I only go by what the tape measure says and it doesnt lie. This is also a great fix for cellulite that you want to get rid of wherever it is on your body it tones you very quickly. I have had 2 kids and been down to my pre pregnancy size within a few weeks after starting the exercises. Did I mention the facial exercises? That's probably the best part of this exercise routine.

When something works for people I think that companies are afraid they might go under with there diet gimmicks.

2208336,5,B0007CI95O,"I'm a skeptic so in 1999 when I first got the book from Childers--I took it with a grain of salt, then I went on a trip to Atlanta only to find that I was not fitting into the outfit I had planned to wear--I needed to have a waist of 29 or smaller and not only was my waist at 31 due to air plane bloating, but I had a pouch too and those lines you get across a skirt or pant when it is waaaay too small  (could only be 40 at the most and I was 43)(tight folds of fabric--I had 3 you do the math) I  needed to fit into a tight no stretch  silk skirt by the next morning or run out to buy a new outfit for my event.  I could not diet or ""purge""  for this  because there was no time.

I took out the body flex book (knowing it would not work either)  and desperately  did 3 rounds of the seiko, back to back and the side stretches  the seiko burned like all get out (as it is supposed to do) I have to say that I HATE doing the seiko as it is unpleasant and BURNS--but it really, really works. A little desperation goes a long way. The next morning, around 10am  with my heart in my throat, I put on the skirt--it slid right on and fastened and my stomach was FLAT as a board.  My size?  27 inch waist and 39 inch hips--all from just that hellround of exercise. Do I believe in this program? You bet..but the road from belief to doing something is fraught with good intentions--when I do the program right and STICK TO IT (4 weeks minimum) it works--when I slack and only half breathe right and half blank follow it--then results are not so good. I am betting if you follow even half the people who do not have great results with this program--the problem will lie in their technique or discipline in sticking to it. If you do it right, it works--if it does not work, probably a lot of things or diets don't work --because you HAVE to do your part and slackers get bad results no matter what they try.",1337731200,39,1899,3.978891820580475
2208337,5,B0007CI95O,"I have used this workout before and it does work. I lost several inches all over my body the first week and also in the later Weeks. The breathing have me energy, I craved healthier foods,and the cellulite on my thighs was totally gone in three Weeks. Each stretch works the stomach. I found that after doing these breathing exercises my stomach muscles would literally cause me to hold my stomach in all the time without effort. It has been some years and I still have the muscle that i gained doing this workout. Greer Childress is the real deal. Love it!",1335225600,17,557,4.470588235294118
2208338,5,B0007CI95O,"My husband ordered this tape for me from an infomercial, when it first came out. I thought it was in the mid-80's, but I can't remember exactly.  I used it then and it definitely worked.  I did the workout twice a day- morning and evening and I did lose inches- very noticeably in my waist. Of course, I was a lot younger then and in a lot better shape.
I've been trying to get back to regular exercise and thought about trying this again. I was planning to update to a DVD, but since they are still selling the tapes, I'm glad I kept mine.
It will be interesting to see how this works for a senior citizen! I'm going to start this week and see what happens.
As far as a review of the product, I can say that it really did work to reduce the inches and it was easy to do.  I also liked the idea that you could target specific problem areas, and spend more time on those if you like.  Also, after the stretching and deep breathing, you can't help but feel good.",1321228800,10,960,4.090425531914893

I received many compliments on my shape within a month of using this and even with weight fluctuations throughout the years my waist and legs are still slim. When I got married I was embarrassed to do this around my husband but I told him I was doing a form of yoga and pilates and that seemed to have worked for him. Finding this was a God-send after many years of painful back breaking push-ups and sit-ups. The concept is basic in that oxygen burns fat. It's easy, simple and fast, everything I've ever asked for.

She makes such ridiculous faces when she inhales and such a ghastly sound when she exhales that I just laugh and laugh, which is not helping me to breathe deeply! The other reviewers must be either much more serious people than I am, or they have some stake in the sales of this video.

2208344,5,B0007CI95O,"I have rated this product with 5 stars because of the results I got from it.
I bought this workout set in 1998.  It's 2010 and even after all these years, I find that Body Flex (The original program, not Body Flex+) is the fastest way for me to lose inches off my body.

Pros:

1.  No dieting involved.

2.  It's only 15 minutes long.

3.  You see results almost every week, guaranteed. (In 1998 I lost an inch or more off my upper abs, lowers abs, waist and hips every week.  4+ inches total every week is an awesome result.  I went from a 29 inch waist to a 24 inch waist in just 4 weeks.)

4.  Makes you lose fat from your face and chin.

5.  No equipment needed.

Cons:

1.  You have to do it on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. (However, you can drink coffee or water before you exercise. For faster results you need an empty stomach.)

2.  After the first week you have to do it twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening before dinner.

3.  The exercises are funny to look at and you look funny doing it.

4.  The breathing out part of the exercise can make you cough.

5.  The exercise is noisy and if your walls are thin, you will be heard.

6.  You cannot miss a day or you will not see results.

Things I realized:

In 1998 I had lost all those inches because I was determined and I never missed a workout.
You have to have that determined mindset in order reap the benefits of this unconventional exercise program.

Advise:
Exercise everyday on an empty stomach and measure your body every week.

The set I received came with a measuring tape and an instruction pamphlet that included a measuring chart.

The measuring chart has 5 columns.  Upper Abs, Lower Abs, Waist, Hips, and Thighs. The inches suggested below are from the pamphlet.

Upper Abs is 3 inches above waist.
Waist is your natural waist.
Lower Abs is 2 inches below waist.
Hips is 6 inches from waist.
Thighs - measure the largest part.  It is best to measure how many inches it is away from your thigh crease(where your hips met your thighs) that way you can measure the same area without error.

The measuring chart has no column for your arms, neck and calves, but you can add it to a homemade chart.  My homemade chart includes:

Neck - I just measure around the middle of my neck.
Upper arms - measure 3 inches from elbow crease.
Forearms - measure from 2 inches from elbow crease.
Bracelet area - measure 1.5 inches from wrist crease.
Calves - measure 3.5 inches from the knee crease.
This is just an example.  You of course can adjust the inches to make sure you are measuring the largest parts of these areas.

And the chart has rows of Week 0, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4.

Week 0 is your first day. Measure right before you begin your workout.

Her instruction pamphlet said that for the first week do Body flex on an empty stomach in the morning.  She also said that cutting back on red meat and drinking 8 glasses of water a day will help you lose more inches.

After the first week she advises to do Body Flex in the evenings as well, before eating dinner.  ( When you eat, blood goes to your stomach and digestive system.  She wants you to work out on an empty stomach so there is more blood to rush to the areas being worked out.)

Like Greer says, the tape measure doesn't lie.  Seeing the proof of your results really does help motivate you to do Body Flex every day and will help you achieve your ideal body mass.",1267920000,91,3437,4.231481481481482
2208345,5,B0007CI95O,"I have to wonder why she left this and went on to the other way. The breathing is WONDERFUL, gets you very hopped up and works. I don't see the Body Flex advance, but if you can ever get your hands on it, BUY IT. Its a Nine minute workout and the Breathing Tech never stops, you do it all the way thru each postion, only one break. But man are you Ready for the day!!!
I started this over 10 yrs ago, and I love it. I have to wonder if the breathing way had to be let go of because of some Health Issues.
Do this, This is for Folks who are OVER WEIGHT and cant move very well. This is for those who are in Wheel chairs,.  Thanks Greer",1238284800,20,634,3.803030303030303

2208347,5,B0007CI95O,"When I read other reviews, I was a bit skeptical. Although I have only been using the program for a week, my energy level has dramatically increased! It is too early to tell about weight loss but this program has made me feel more energized and more relaxed than any excersise program that I ever tried. The program only takes approximately 18 minutes a day and within those minutes, I feel great! I would recommend this system to anyone who wants a energy boost within a short period of time.

2208348,4,B0007CI95O,"I have lost some weight since using this and Oxycise techniques.  However, I have also been eating very carefully and taking supplemetns like Rhodiola (fantastic for energy and mood!) and NuZyme, which also help weight loss.  Plus I have been doing other exercises.  No, I don't think this tape gives enough variety for exercise.  Having said that, I do find these techniques to be very beneficial. They certainly help tighten the facial muscles and no doubt other muscles as well. For another thing, I noticed almost overnight - as others have reported - that my singing voice definitely improved.  I also noticed I was walking more quickly and briskly.  The skin improvement someone else reported....hmmm, I have noticed that too.  I am only giving 4 stars because I'm not sure about the weight loss.  Maybe others lose weight that way, though.  One thing is for sure, breathing more diaphragmatically and increasing oxygen is goooood.  It is one of the things that helps prevent cancer.  I have stopped watching the tapes and am just doing the breathing techniques and facial exercises (not just the ones she shows) while doing pilates.  Don't want to give up pilates!  They have been the best exercise for me.  Be careful when you do the breathing exercises not to strain.  Yes, they look easy but if you strain on anything you can get some aches and pains.  Some people report inches loss without weight loss.  Makes sense.  These exercises cause you to tighten muscles.",1223164800,7,1475,4.879032258064516

Not only has it toned me up and slimmed me down to my ideal weight as promised, but with it, I've been able to maintain my figure without any problem for the past 2 years. The 15 minutes necessary to do it each morning is more than worth the time and effort, and I would highly recommend this program to anyone.",1206489600,16,547,4.169811320754717

You can't help but be in a good mood and finish the tape to see what face she'll be making next.  Seriously though, it is easy and fun and really really works.

2208353,5,B0007CI95O,"I purchased this product when it first came out in 1993.  I didn't really get the hang of it, and put it in the closet.  After 2 pregnancies I got it out and gave it an honest try.  I did it 2x per day for 12 weeks and lost a total of 45 inches.  I went from a size 24 to a size 16.  Unfortunatly I got pregnant again and had to stop.  I gained almost 80 pounds during the last pregnancy, but only went back up to a size 20.  I have started again, and I am on my second week and have lost 8 1/2 inches.  I have tried everything else, including going to the gym for 2 hours a day, and this has been the only thing that has worked for me.  I also follow a high fiber diet,(30 or more grams per day)  I can't say enough about it, it really works.",1174867200,38,743,3.7051282051282053

I add my own ab and chest exercises at the end because those are the spots I want to work, so my workout ends up being about 22 minutes long.",1518739200,,382,3.8974358974358974

8046712,4,B0007CI95O,"I bought this VHS tape long ago and did it. Crazy positions, but it works. I also am a fan of Callanetics. I have done both over the yrs. This is WAY easier than Callanetics. I have watched my diet but after menopause gravity is just cruel, and I had stopped these as I walk and hike with my dogs. That keeps the weight off, but it doesn't do anything to tone up the sagging. So I found the VHS tape again and started back doing this 1st as it is easier, then probably go back to Callanetics because it tightens you up, but isn't easy, those exercises are grueling imho. They get results, but you must put in the effort. I don't understand how this didn't work for some. I have always had great results if I stick to it. I do up my water intake as it seems to flush out the sludge. This gives me more energy. Callanetics for me, seems to really tire me out until I get to where I can do it with ease, then I regain energy. But that initial revamp phase is taxing to me. That is why I prefer this, it doesn't deplete my energy, it increases it.",1475280000,,1043,4.043478260869565

Now I think the initial inch-loss was just a placebo effect due to my strong belief and happiness that I had thought I finally found something that would work. Sadly, it didn't.",1456790400,2,340,4.328125
