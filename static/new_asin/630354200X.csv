716811,2,630354200X,"First, this is a poor, fuzzy transfer from videotape.  (Paula even refers to ""this tape"" several times.) As for the content, this will be a fun dance tutorial for anyone wanting to learn some classic 80's-style choreography, and if you keep up and follow along, you WILL get a good workout.  However, the dance moves are very tricky for anyone on a non-ideal dance surface (like carpeting) and they consist of a lot of leg and ankle twists and other steps that are not only difficult but dangerous for anyone with knee or ankle issues.  Be warned.",1484438400,,547,4.618556701030927

716813,5,630354200X,"Love love this video. You need some sort of rhythm and dance skills but it is not difficult and is low impact. It's not much of a high intensity workout, but has a great beat and enjoyable",1469404800,,188,4.108108108108108

716816,3,630354200X,Does not give much instruction or practice.  You can get a good workout if you don't get all caught up in trying to do the moves exactly right.,1462147200,,143,4.107142857142857
716817,3,630354200X,"I have been doing aerobics for almost 30 years.  I have done high impact, low impact, step, etc.  I am now old enough and have enough joint issues (Crohn's) that I just try to get my heart rate up for 20 minutes and not kill my knees and ankles.  I bought this for my teenage daughter and I to do at home when she is not participating in swim team practices.  It operates on the typical aerobics premise of teaching you a series of moves to form a combination and then there are several combinations that come together to create the whole routine.  We got through the first combo pretty well.  Thereafter, it went downhill.  We found the moves very complicated.  I believe the level listed for this one was intermediate.  If that is true, then I would hate to see what counts as advanced.  I got through the routine, but mostly flopped around not doing the moves correctly.  My daughter gave up.  I would classify this as advanced, and advise buyers that a background in dance would be helpful to successfully navigate this product.",1456704000,,1032,4.518918918918919

It's just the right mix of achievable and interesting.  I feel like I'm really dancing, and, although the music may be a bit cheesy by today's standards, it really makes me feel like working out.  I like it so much that I had to order the DVD version now, years later, and I still can't find any other dance exercise video I like as much.

I was concerned that I would have challenges because I am out of shape but I find it easy to modify the steps and slow them down a bit. It is important to not over do it. This workout is very fun and you can go at your own pace.,1415145600,,375,3.5301204819277108

Having said that, if you have some talent for dance, it's a really fun, really good workout.  It's good cardio and also works the whole body.  I've used the video for years, and I still love it. One of my friends--who isn't a dancer--has started doing it with me, and she really likes it.  She didn't get the moves too much at first but she still enjoyed it and worked up a sweat!  I love it!",1409356800,,536,4.155339805825243

716959,3,630354200X,This DVD is fine for those who are very agile and young or have danced their whole life.

She then steps it up to medium tempo, before suddenly elevating into full high energy dance moves. At first the steps was a little difficult to master, but I didn't quit. As a result of working out to this video 3-5 times a week, along with walking, I lost 50 lbs. I recommend this video to anyone who likes cardio.",1394236800,,482,4.08421052631579

717065,2,630354200X,"Unless I become somehow so bored of my other exercise DVDs, I doubt I will be using this video much. There are several reasons:
1. The over-the-top adulation and ridiculous fawning over the star power (?!) of Paula Abdul is pretty off-putting from the get-go, and it makes the intro to the video unforgivably prolonged and boring. They waste probably 5 minutes showing them setting up for the taping, recording Paula talking to the dancers, etc. For heaven's sake, it's an EXERCISE video, not a documentary -- get on with it!
2. It is very dated -- believe it's over 10 years old, and the dancing, music and clothing show it.
3. Possibly the most annoying part is that over and over again we are essentially told that ""these dancers are people we took off the street"" i.e. they are just like any ordinary schmoe watching the video. Well, unless they took these people off the street IN A LINE FOR A DANCE AUDITION, there's no way these people are non-dancers! Bringing me to my last point--
4. The steps are not impossible, but unless you are very coordinated you will probably have to rewind and rewind to get the steps right. She does not take enough time to repeat the steps slowly, IMO.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because if someone is coordinated and loves Paula Abdul, they might find this tolerable.",1391385600,,1311,4.555084745762712
717066,5,630354200X,the video is great for indoor work out on a rainy day my 8y/o nephew also enjoys it. I have no clue as to what he is doing but he like to jump around with me and it.,1389571200,,165,3.3684210526315788
717067,5,630354200X,"When I was in Jr. High, I had put on some weight and wanted to lose it before the summer was over. My grandmother had 'Paula Abdul's Get up and Dance and Paula Abdul Cardio Dance on VHS. I lost a lot of weight. 8 Years later I was out of shape and I wanted something fun... not the usual workout DVD. I looked it up on Amazon hoping they would have it on DVD and they did!! I was so excited. I ordered them both.

The DVD workout is fast and fun. They do different sets of dance moves and they put them all together at the very end. They start off slow and gradually get faster. I have read a lot of people saying you have to know how to dance and this is too hard for a beginner... I don't dance and I am so clumsy! Of course it's going to be hard at first and you may think oh my gosh I can't do any of this but you do it everyday... even if that means you make up some of the moves before you actually get it down. It's challenging but you can do it. I lost a lot of weight doing both DVD's I mentioned. Also, you do the WMCA at the end and it's so fun!",1388966400,3,1056,3.7354260089686098
717068,4,630354200X,"This is something to definitely get us started.  It makes a good warm-up to a more intense video and is mostly fun.  Once we got the moves down though, we only wanted to do the very end of the video where she puts all the dance moves together.",1374019200,,243,4.041666666666667
717069,5,630354200X,"I liked this workout because it is fairly simple and alot of fun. I did work up a sweat and laughed and really enjoyed the ""YMCA"" dance",1370304000,,135,4.037037037037037

717131,5,630354200X,"This workout video is NOT for beginners.  As expected, this video includes some fun and somewhat complicated dance moves.  Also, it doesn't spend a lot of time on each move: 2X slow and then increase the speed 2X until you are at tempo.  Then the same for 2 more moves, then put those 3 together.  Then, on to another set of 3 moves.  Very challenging for me.  But I will get it eventually and, at least I am not bored!",1364947200,,419,4.175
717132,5,630354200X,"Wow, this was recommended on fitbottomgirls.com This workout is no joke! Will leave you sweating. If you are not coordinated I do not suggest buying this.

717135,5,630354200X,I bought the VHS version a long time ago. The steps are easy to learn within 2-3 weeks of constant watching. You'll work up a sweat and then some. Always drink water and workout at your own pace.,1360108800,,195,4.157894736842105

Completely ticked when it arrived in the correct package but was something totally different on the dvd even though the dvd was even labeled correct.

  Paula is a TRUE professional, guiding you through the steps of the workout seamlessly with her energetic style.  You do the steps at slow-medium-then fast, which is the best way to learn for most students. The workout is perfectly paced, just like a real dance class so you get a slammin' warm up, a jammin cardio session with jazzy choreography and a soothing cooldown that makes you feel like a dancer. Were this 1995, I would have given this vid a 5-star rating.  The moves and music definitely date it but, ya know what?  NOBODY'S gunna be looking at you dancing like an Old-Schooler because you are in your own living room doin' the moves.  Okay so Paula....WHEN are you gunna do a new version??

I have to agree with some other reviews I have read, that this work out program isn't for everyone because of its complexity, unless you have some background in hip-hop dancing (which I do!). Some dance moves might seem hard to get for some people; however, the more these moves are practiced the better the results are going to be. I totally recommend this work out DVD if you are looking for a nice, fast pace, sweaty work out :)!",1304467200,,559,4.137614678899083

Yes, it was fast at first and some of the moves really aren't too intuitive and don't flow, but after several weeks, I finally got the dances down.  Once you've got it down, your heart rate will go up and start sweating.
Downside to this video is the camera work.  There are multistep moves that really require your full attention and the zooming in on Paula's face instead her feet does not help.
Another negative is the instruction.  Paula is not a good teacher, thus taking people long to learn the moves.  But having 2 other instructors there chiming in and sometimes talking over one another is very annoying.
If you do get this, keep at it!!  You will be rewarded in the end!",1299715200,,770,4.425531914893617

I love the way paula shows the steps in three stages and the pools them altogether so you can have a sequence at the end when all 9 of the steps are joined for a dance workout, I amazed myself that I remembered each of them and did them correctly. I love this video..definitely a must have...",1294790400,,399,4.194805194805195

It's hard, especially for a person with two left feet (again, that would be me). But it's so much fun that I didn't care how ridiculous I must have looked, and when I was finally able to dance for 40 minutes straight with Paula and her crew, I felt as if I had climbed Mount Everest. Get Up and Dance is a great workout. It gets my heart rate up, it makes me laugh, and I never get bored when I do it. If you are looking for instant gratification, this isn't the workout for you, but if you are willing to stick with it and have fun, you'll never get tired of the routine.",1294185600,2,677,3.948905109489051

717261,5,630354200X,"I have had this workout for years, and absolutely LOVE it!  However, it was extremely frustrating at first--just like some of the other reviews I had to learn it little by little, but I still got a great workout.  It is definitely not for a beginner (unless you take breaks).  You will be sweating the entire way through.  It is so much fun, and she's very encouraging.  She really creates a happy, relaxed atmosphere, and she really wants us to have fun with it.  So in the beginning when I couldn't master all the moves, sometimes I would just make up my own dance and have fun until the next segment started.

The instruction is very systematic.  You learn several dance steps (I can't remember offhand exactly how many), and with each three steps that you learn, she shows you how to combine them before moving on to the next three.  So  you practice the steps individually and combined with other steps.  Then you do the entire routine twice after learning all the steps.  The ab workout at the end is really intense, too.  My favorite part is the YMCA cooldown.

I LOVE THIS WORKOUT, and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves to dance.",1248220800,2,1146,4.5

717264,4,630354200X,Paula's Dance DVD is awesome.  Admittedly it does take a few times of practice to get it down pat.  Once I got stressed from rewinding and trying to figure out each and every step I just wanted to give up.  I always tell my 4 yr old son he can do anything as long as he practice.  I want him to see me working hard to accomplish those little things that seem immpossible.  Anyhoo after trying and retrying the steps I decided to stop worrying about the moves and just have fun.  Do your own thing and when you can incorporate Paula's moves into yours.  Eventually you start picking up Paula's moves along with a few cool steps of your own.  Don't rush it or you'll get tired of it.  Just GET UP & DANCE & HAVE LOTS OF FUN!!!,1243900800,,724,4.114285714285714

This video is much more frustrating than it has to be because of the poor camera work. Throughout the video, the camera keeps cutting between shots above her waist, shots from above and far away, shots of her students from funny angles, and shots even of her on what seems to be a monitor tv of some sort.  AHHH!! Especially when she is teaching a step and all you want to do is just watch her feet transition from one move to the next, the camera keeps shifting just to confuse you some more.

717418,4,630354200X,"UPDATE : a few years on and this has to be my aALL time FAVE DVD workout!  Unfortunately I can't update the rating - but I would definitely give it 5 stars as it has really stood the test of time.  I just don't get bored with it!  I switch every now and then to something else - just for a change, but always come back to this one and totally have a blast doing it.  It really is great fun, and a really thorough workout.  I love Paula's attitude - it's very motivating and energising and very encouraging too.  This is great when I'm really not in the mood for working out too, as after the first minute I'm totally into, and having fun! and before I know it I'm done!  which is such a great feeling when you felt like there's no way you could stomach a workout today...  Oh and it's really simple to follow the moves once you've done it a few times, just stick with it..

OLD REVIEW - which still stands..
This is sooooo different to Paula's Cardio Dance DVD...  This one is done in a huge warehouse or dance studio, with about 100 other dancers! (well maybe 30..) which I found a little off putting at first, as the camera kept switching from person to person..  but now I really love that aspect! It feels like you are doing a live dance/aerobics class..

The moves are very energetic - which I liked.  They take a few practices to get perfect - but are not that difficult.  The George Jetson is hilarious!!  'o)  The main difficulty is doing all the steps for each dance move in the rapid time sequence!  but I've only done this once (with a few replays during..) so I'm sure it will get easier. (Update : it does...)

I was surprised this wasn't from the 80s, given the look and feel of it.  It has a kind of Flashdance, Breakfast Club kind of feel.. which adds to the whole fun atmosphere of the DVD.

The moves are much easier to grasp than Cardio Dance - but the overall workout is much more energetic. (though Cardio Dance is WELL worth the effort it takes to get the moves figured out..) Look out for the cheesy YMCA bit in the middle!!  I was soooo embarrassed that someone would walk by my window at that moment!!! 'o)  I recommend closing the curtains!  but it is fun, and I was laughing while doing it..

To avoid injury, I'd recommend taking your time to go over and over the moves initially, so you have them down pat before trying to do them at the manic pace the dancers do..  I don't find doing it on the carpet a problem at all, and you are reminded to lift your knees when doing those kind of moves

Having said that, it is great fun, and it does provide a great cardio workout!  and there are a LOT of sit ups in the toning/abs section, which is great - as a lot of cardio workouts neglect that..

Personally, I prefer Cardio Dance - as it's not quite so manic.. (UPDATE : not any more!) but this one is a slightly more energetic workout.. which gets your heart rate up a little more than Cardio Dance..  so I may grow to prefer this for that reason alone..  (UPDATE : I did) I don't feel Paula's gentle side of her personality shines so much in this one.. but her lively side sure does.. (Update : I actually really love this workout now that I'm used to the very different style.  I like both Paula's DVDs for different reasons.  This one's manic but great fun.  Cardio Dance is a great workout, but slightly slower pace than this one.  This is now my FAVE all time dance workout, and I honestly REALLY look forward to doing it, because it really is just so much fun!!  and I do it 6 times a week, and have had it for (UPDATE : a few years now), and I still really enjoy it - and I have soooo noticed my body tone up!!)",1173398400,7,3644,4.171919770773639
717419,2,630354200X,I just did this routine and found it extremely poorly cued compared to other dance/cardio routines I have done.  I think part of it is that it was shot in 1995 but she only gives you 2 chances to learn the steps and then it goes to tempo which is a very fast tempo.  The thing I found most offensive is that the cameraman was constantly focusing on Paula's FACE rather than her FEET while you were trying to learn the steps.  It is definitely a good cardio workout but I'll save my cardio on a better cued routine.,1173225600,,514,4.171717171717172

Some mornings I just do the warm up and the first section.  It is segmented so you can add more as you have the time and energy.  You don't need a lot of space.

717422,5,630354200X,"I've been doing this workout on and off for about 10 years and I was THRILLED to find it on DVD!

DETAILS:
I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to dance and wants a good workout. With Paula you will warm up safely, WELL and PROPERLY - and then stretch out effectively - all in a fun, dance format. It's sheer genius!

EASY TO UNDERSTAND:
When the dance steps begin they are taught in a progression - slowly and then up to tempo. Paula cues very well in this DVD and she has her two backup dancers cue you as well. It is VERY easy to understand the movements. When I first learned this workout (years ago) I hit rewind on the ""tape"" and did the moves over several times until I ""got"" them.

FUN HIP HOP DANCE MOVES:
The moves are pretty uncomplicated - but they WILL take a little repetition to learn. It is well WORTH the practice because it's an energetic, REALLY GOOD workout. At the end you will do the entire choreography TWICE - working up a good sweat.

After the final choreography there is a REALLY fun and silly cool down - but it does not end there. After the cool down there is some great stretching and some ab work too!

**THIS DVD IS STILL TIMELY**
I want to point out that even though this was made in the 1990's it is STILL timely - because the dancing is ""hip-hop"" which is never outdated. And I can't stress enough that it's a GREAT workout. Enjoy some classic music, have a great workout and enjoy!

I get so crazy with videos that explain to you for an entire minute while you are frozen and just waiting to get on with it. Paula Abdul just jumps right in and you have to sink or swim. Disadvantage is that it will take a few viewings before you can accurately emulate these moves. Which can be seen as an incentive to use this video again and again. It is now part of my regular rotation, and each time I put it in it's a challenge to get up to speed...but a fun time while I struggle with my coordination challenges. I mean, we're at home, right? I'd never brave a class like this in reality ... but can freely embarass myself over laughter at home.

The Amazon editorial review is accurate in that the camera angles make it difficult to see the steps properly. I found myself with the remote replaying a few combinations in order to get it down.

Negative: the music is really awful.

Positive: Since you're concentrating on the moves, you are sweating like crazy without even realizing you're working out. A fun time.",1156291200,7,1166,4.413953488372093

If you don't like to dance, don't bother with this DVD. However, if you like to dance, then that's what will make this one fun.  When I first started this VHS, 10 years ago--and 10 years younger--I thought it was hard.  It took me a bit of practicing before I could get the steps; but I DIDN'T QUIT.  Eventually, I got all the moves. I didn't even have all the range of motion either, but that improves as your body gets use to doing the routines.  I haven't worked this VHS for a few years, and I needed to get in better shape so I pulled it out again.  I am 47 years old, and about 30 pounds overweight, and if I can do this routine at my age (it took me about two weeks to be able to get through it again), anyone can do it.  The key is, you must love dancing and this kind of aerobic workout.  You can tone the movements down until you get better at them, and rev it up as you get better.  But once you get it, you will always want to do it. This is a great workout, and I will be doing it for along time. For all the nay sayers: either they don't really like to dance, or they just gave up too soon.  And by the way, this was not called ""Hip-hop"" 10 years ago.  ""Hip-hop"" is just a new name which includes a lot of old styles.  I don't particularly care for ""Hip-hop."" And I would not consider this a ""Hip-hop"" DVD.",1154044800,5,1471,3.8993288590604025

I use Yoga for flexibility and strength training, but I needed a cardio workout that didn't feel like ""exercise"".

It seems that most of the aerobic/cardio workout tapes out there either spend so much time on instruction that you end up having to use the fast forward button all the time after the first time through it OR the moves are just glorified jumping jacks.  This video is neither of those things...  It is total fun!

Yes, I realize that I am a dancer and yes, I did the whole workout the first time I played it (didn't have all the moves down pat...but did most everything).  But if you are not a ""dancer"" just stick with it!  I think you will find it worthwhile in the end.  And isn't it better to be challenged?

I haven't done much Hip-Hop dancing but I take Jazz lessons 1-2 times a week. I do ballet and other dancing also. Still, this DVD was slightly challenging for me. I was able to follow most movements on a first trial but I had to go back and relearn 2 of these steps. The dance style is a bit outdated but fun!

She does a poor job naming the steps and the camera doesn't follow the feet slow enough, so there is a steep learning curve if you don't have a dance background. The last song, which is led by some of the other dancers, is the best and easiest to follow along, but I still didn't feel as worked-out physically at the end of the routine as I'm used to feeling.

She does slow down the music & steps to 2/3 speed for 3 repetitions, not even 1/2 speed, but that's not enough for me comfortably. She would just quickly call out ""swish right, left step, right step up & around"" & that's the only instruction. She teaches popular steps from the 90s like the Goerge Jetson, etc.
The dance steps look cool, it is fun with all the people, though a bit too many so you can't see anyone's feet when they focus on faces. The camera moves WAY too much, focusing on one person or group, then another & another, or just faces, even when Paula is teaching which is the biggest problem of the workout. This dvd is still much easier to follow then her other one.
The music contains mostly Paula's music w/singing.
The moves contain a lot of kicks, running & swivels & best for those who workout at least semi regularly & can follow other dance workout dvds easily.

  Unless you have a lot of experience in dance hip-hop, jazz dance the steps may be challenging.

Don't rush.  Take a little at a time.

Anyone can learn moves - all it takes is repetition  - just doing it over and over (that and not giving up).

And to get or stay fit you need repetition.

Thus this video encourages the viewer to repeatedly play it;

repeatedly exercising and before you know it - surprise - you're getting more fit, staying fit, and not ""working"" at it! (along with getting more agile, more balance, more finesse, more confidence, more grace (i.e., your manner of moving is smoother)).

Think of it as your dance class you have x times a week - but it's even better because you can do it in private.

I found myself at different times during the day (when stressed, nervous, bored, waiting, needing to relax - all different times), I found myself practicing some of the steps....i.e., the perfect remedy for any of those situations and so good for ya!!

The workout doesn't seem as challenging as some others that are out on the market (taebo for example) but by the middle of it I could tell that I was really working. I love this video. It makes working out fun, not a chore. I'd recommend this for anyone who doesn't have much time to get to the gym but still wants to get a great workout at home. Just one warning- don't do this on carpet. I never have but I've read a few reviews that warn against attempting to do the moves on a carpet.

My complaints: I was hoping that the workout would actually be put to her music, only the warm-up and cool-down are done with Paula music otherwise it's just energized aerobics score; one has to watch a few times to get the steps down, the camera man was a better music video shooter then an aerobics cameraman; He focuses on her face and the girl in the window more than the footwork which is tricky.

If you want to have a really good time, easily catch on to the moves, but effectively sweat a storm by the end of the tape, get ""The Grind Workout Hip-Hop Aerobics"".

In the end, there's a nice cool down and a killer abdominal workout. I can't wait to do it again tomorrow...It's SO nice to not have to hear ""Feel the burn!"" by a toothpick who lost you at the warm up and keeps telling you ""You're doing great!""  When you know you're not until you finally sit down, watch HER do it while you eat.  It was just nice to learn how to dance, burn fat, and release tension, while having fun and who better to teach someone how to dance than Paula Abdul.  She's welcome in my living room any day.

She makes a passing attempt at teaching you the moves, but a couple of times she actually completely skips teaching you the move and just does it at the speed of light and expects you to get it.  It was freggin sadistic.  I'd rather have an impossibly difficult video with good moves than an unbearably easy video, however, so it gets two stars.  If you pick up stuff fast and easily, this would probably be a good investment.  Also, the set and costumes made me laugh a lot, way too old.

The frequent reminders from Paula Abdul, her dancers and her recruited people exercising in the background to ""not give up!"" and ""pause the tape if you have to!"" were actually more intimidating than encouraging, and I thought that they moved way too fast through everything.  I lost the remote to my VHS long ago and I was constantly hovering near the rewind button.
However, despite my first misgivings, I kept plugging away and it wasn't really all that long before I had the moves down and was exercising right along with them.  Then it was suddenly nice that the tape was fast paced, because it means that its still interesting without a ton of really slow instruction.

Paula says the gazillion people in the video with her are ""normal folks"". Oh, please. I guess you can catch on to this tape after watching and rewinding a million times, even though I've had it six years and I still hate it and can't get through the warmup. I guess I could learn this tape if I really wanted to but I want to burn fat, not learn how to be Britney Spears.

The workout has a warmup, 3 dancing sections (each with 3 little dances per section), a cool down, and toning section that targets the abs.  Before the cool down there's a little YMCA dance, which I sometimes fast foward through.  The moves are taught at a lower tempo and put together at the end in the routine.

717811,5,630354200X,"Paula Abdul--choreographer to the stars--and two of her colleagues lead a workout which will challenge your feet and leave you sweating. As far as I know, she's not a certified aerobics instructor, but she had Karen Voight serve as Fitness Consultant for this video, and that was good enough for me. She's taught dance routines for years.  Much of what she did for George Michael, Janet Jackson, and the guys from ZZTop probably involved getting them to relax and not worry over how goofy they felt when they couldn't get the steps the first time around.  She does spend some time talking about that before you begin this routine.  In the words of the customer service experts, she practiced good expectations management there.  So I wasn't surprised or disappointed that I couldn't get it all the first time, either.  Heck, I like a challenge!
You can't do this if you're sleepy.  I've never tried it at 5:00am.  To me, it's more of a ""let's dance and have a party"" routine, and one I want to be fully awake for. And there are no modifications given for those who want or need a gentler routine. But this is an intermediate program, after all. I've found that if I didin't snap my neck all the way around, bend my knees too deeply, or jump--just raise my arms toward the ceiling and go up on my toes--then I was all right. I'd also encourage folks who want to keep their heart rate up to use a full range of motion dring the ""teaching"" segments of the routine and really lift their knees up during the ""march-it-outs."" I found that even the ""YMCA cooldown"" (which is really goofy but fun, anyway!) can be aerobic if I made my moves bigger. If this sounds like too much work, then pick up a Kathy Smith or Donna Richardson video, practice the low-impact modifiers they teach, and come back to Paula's program later!
Having given those caveats, I still think this is a great, fun, inspiring workout. Paula is beautiful and she's passionate about dancing.  This tape is her way of making some of that accessible to the masses. You've gotta love her for that! One exerciser is 42, another is 50--so it's not all 20-somethings. I knew going in that it would take consistent practice to master the dance steps. After a month, I had most of them learned, and abandoned my ""modifications"" to really go for it. I'm also glad to see an aerobics tape which includes abdominal floor work after the cooldown. If I do ab stuff even a little bit following an all-out cardio routine, my back usually benefits from the stretching and muscle work, too.  The most important things are to not get discouraged if you can't get all the steps down in a week or two, and as Paula says, ""don't give up"" and ""have a great time!""  I didn't and I did.  Hope that's true for you, too!",987033600,38,2756,4.514056224899599

It does  help, however, if you have some dance experience, because she uses a few  terms that may not be familiar to someone who hasn't taken a class before.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking to get in shape, loves to dance  and finds it hard to get motivated (like me!).",950227200,,568,3.878260869565217
717919,5,630354200X,"I only have 3 fitness videos in my permanent collection, and this is one of them. She divides the routine into sections, and each section is performed slowly, then repeated as the tempo increases. It's very similar  to learning a new routine in dance class.  I have grown tired of the same  choreography repeated over and over in a typical fitness video.  If you  crave more challenging choreography, this is your tape (there's also a  decent ab workout included).",947203200,,464,4.810126582278481
717920,2,630354200X,The camera doesn't stay still long enough for you to actually see the dancers move.  I won't use it again - wish I never bought it,947030400,2,130,4.0
717921,2,630354200X,"Paula's a great dancer, but when this video was choreographed she forgot that many of us work out on carpeting. This video incorporates many twisting and turning moves which are probably great on a wood or tile  floor, but doing them on carpeting could injure your knees. Be careful!",946944000,5,283,4.775510204081633
717922,5,630354200X,"This tape is great. The first time you try it, you will think you have no rthytm and probably feel like a failure. But, by the fourth time you will  be in line and think you should of been a dancer. This tape is guaranteed  to keep you interested and never gets boring. It not only gets you in shape  but also has side affects of building confidence and a great attitude.",940896000,,371,4.125
7853737,5,630354200X,I really like this video. It registers on a media player at home just like the larger systems. Its fun and works well to get me fit and in shape. I know it to be an excellent media product.,1509148800,,189,3.871794871794872

7853739,5,630354200X,"First off here's some background on me: I'm plus size, work out 5-6x a week and I'm not a good dancer. The first time I tried this dvd I told my husband that Paula Abdul was trying to kill me. I would kinda get a step down and then the pace increased to a crazy speed. I felt lost thru 1/4 of it, but was still able to move and feel like I was working out.

The second time I did the routine I was able to follow along much better. The best part of the workout is that it's fun. There's a YMCA dance in between the dance and the sit up section. It kinda gets you in the mood to continue working out. The speed is challenging, but it also makes the time speed by. A 45 minute workout feels like 20, which rarely happens. She keeps you so busy that you can't wonder how much time is left. Great dvd",1501113600,2,796,3.8834355828220857
7853740,1,630354200X,"I just didn't like it, and I'm a dancer who learns choreography quickly.  It just wasn't fun to me.",1498435200,,99,4.2105263157894735
7853741,5,630354200X,"I first bought this when it was in video ( VHS) format years ago !  Then bought it in DVD format , loaned it out and that was it . So I was absolutely thrilled that it was still available. I'm not a lover of exercising and somewhat have two left feet, but I absolutely love this dance work out. When I first watched it years ago, I said there was no way I was going to get the dance moves, but I took her advice eg. pace yourself ( nobody's watching you ) , hydrate , start slowly ; plus the dance moves are initially done slowly so you get it, and gradually increased in pace . I just find it so much fun the concept of exercising doesn't enter my head :) . I've bought other exercise videos ; not only was this the most fun , but I'd look forward to doing it . Just make sure you do it on a surface where twisting your ankles is easy. I bought the ' sneaker socks ' to wear over my dance sneakers so the twisting moves didn't bother me ( bought those on Amazon) . Back in the day I'd sprinkle a little baby powder on a small area of my ceramic tile floor .",1498348800,3,1058,3.853211009174312

7853743,4,630354200X,"I would've given 5 stars, based on the dance alone which I loved, but there are some flaws:
The length of the DVD is 54 minutes however, if you minus the first 4 minutes of talking, 10 minute warm up and a ridiculous end which lasts about 10 minutes, not including the 5 minute cool down.  The overall dance portion, which is the best part and I do enjoy very much, is only about 25 minutes.  The dance routine ends and for some reason they throw in a horrible YMCA dance which is a waste of DVD time where you could actually burn calories, and not to mention it just isn't good.  The back up guys come to the front and lead and make a joke out of the whole thing, Paula didn't even want to do it, or so it didn't seem :)",1489449600,,721,3.9930555555555554
7853744,3,630354200X,Went through teaching the moves way too fast. Beginners would have no chance of catching on. I'm a more advanced dancer and I thought it was too fast. A good workout but I didn't enjoy the pace of the instruction.,1485302400,,213,4.35
