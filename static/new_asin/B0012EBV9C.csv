3087326,4,B0012EBV9C,"This collection includes a couple of really good episodes like ""Jet Assisted Chevy"" and ""Escape from Alcatraz."" It seems to be older episodes, though. Adam and Jamie's personalities don't shine through as much as they do on recent shows, and the flow is awkward at some points. Nevertheless, a good buy and full of Myth Busters' typical hilarious predicaments.",1222560000,3,360,5.11864406779661
3087327,5,B0012EBV9C,"I loved these guys. My teacher brought this movie in for science class and I thought my head was gonna pop off. I enjoy the show from start to finish. I like the one episode where Adam asks Jamie for a countdown from 3-1 and he does it as ""2-3-1"". I also like it with the plywood glider as Adam is flying over Jamie he says ""I fart on you"" that made me bust a gut. Definetly get this DVD for laughs or for teachers for science class. So no more Bill Nye, and hello Mythbusters.",1218585600,,477,3.9791666666666665
3087328,4,B0012EBV9C,Always fun to watch Jamie & Adam blow stuff up. Music from the first couple of episodes is AWFUL - thank goodness they found something to replace it with!,1217635200,,154,4.344827586206897

3087340,5,B0012EBV9C,"I'm a total fan of Mythbusters...I have every episode.  However..I don't buy them on Amazon.  If you want the series...don't get them here.  Go to the discovery store.  You can get them in order and in full season collections..
And the few specials that they no longer carry are available on iTunes. The shows listed on this collection here are parts of the Pilot episodes (which are actually now considered first season) and bits of season 2.  You can get all of these in box sets and in the correct order at the discovery store.

It's where I got ALL of mine.  And I've NEVER regretted it.

So my advice is go the  online Discovery Store and look up Mythbusters.  You can also get really nice t-shirts from there also!

But as for watching Mythbusters..I totally recomment that!  It's a GREAT show!",1286064000,8,800,4.556338028169014
3087341,5,B0012EBV9C,My daughter is a huge fan of Mythbusters. She requested Mythbuster products for Christmas.  She was totally blown away with the DVD.  She was very pleased with the amount of episodes in the collection.  It was well worth the price.,1262476800,,231,4.725
3087342,5,B0012EBV9C,This was a gift from my children to their brother.  They have all enjoyed it immensely.  The only problem is they want to watch it every night! Collection 1 has two episodes that contain material inappropriate for children.,1254700800,,223,4.842105263157895

3087345,4,B0012EBV9C,"This show is done well, and I enjoy most of the Discovery Channel DVDs as well. I have one problem with all of them, though, as well as all of the other documentary DVDs being produced in America.

The times we are living in today are also the titles of SciFi movies from decades ago. Movies that are on DVDs today with subtitles and other languages. Just about every TV series on DVD has the function of Play All except American documentary DVDs. Even the BBC DVDs have Play All and subtitles, so why is it so hard for these American compaines to include these features?

I have the collections of mythbusters, dirty jobs, man vs. wild, et cetra and not one of them so far has had these very common features. Is it too expensive? Are the producers lacking some kind of magic wand that they need to create a play all button on the dvd menu?

What is going on?

Other than that I like these shows and will still continue to purchase the collections, most likely.",1238630400,,961,4.351955307262569
