1896533,5,B00009WNWF,"I admit I haven't seen this video, but judging by the blurb for it it's just some of the TV episodes put together. So, since I've seen nearly every Saddle Club episode, I can tell you that this is really good! If you love movies about friendship, adventure,horses and sometimes boys, then this is for you!",1061769600,2,305,4.464285714285714
1896534,5,B00009WNWF,"This is the greatest series of books and dvds I've ever seen! I've read many of Bonnie Bryants amazing books that tell of the three girls, Lisa Atwood, Carole Hanson and Stevie Lake about their adventures at Pine Hollow, the perfect stable. I've also watched the first DVD about one million times this summer and last. Now this. This one tells about how the girls met, what it was like and going on one of their favorite trail rides of the year, The MTO. (Mountain trail overnight) It all starts when Lisa first goes to Pine Hollow and Veronica pretends to be her friend since Kristi is under Red's spell. Then Lisa accidently spooks Camanche, Stevie's horse, and Stevie hates her for life. Then, to make it worse, Lisa finds out that Veronica is up to something really bad. She's going to call her pager that Veronica slipped under Camanche's saddle. Camanche was acting up, so he spooked, but luckily Lisa saves the day. Then it's time for the MTO. The Saddle club meets a cute boy, Phil Marsten, whom Stevie has a crush on. But Veronica wants him for herself, so she pretends to get hurt on Cobalt, her beautiful stallion, but instead, Cobalt really does freak out and Veronica is left in grave danger. When the Saddle club finds Cobalt racing back to their camp ground, they worry. Is Veronica's trick going to lead her into disaster? Or is the Saddle club going to make it in time to save her? It's a great DVD. You can also catch the episodes on TV on Discovery kids!",1061510400,6,1473,4.5
1896565,4,B00009WNWF,"The 'Saddle Club' is a modern version of Walt Disney's 1955-58 'Spin and Marty'. It is set in Australia and 'Pine Hollow' replaces the 'Triple R Ranch'. It has Stevie (Spin), Lisa (Marty), and Carol, the friends who call themselves the 'Saddle Club'. Both shows are hard to beat because a fantasy shared by most kids is to hang out with horses-ALL THE TIME. Instead of singing songs around the campfire, the girls are shown singing in a recording studio in the closing credits (which adds to the fantasy).

Both Saddle Club and Spin & Marty are little gems that kids will love until ages 11-13, secretly watch for another year, and then come back to in their mid-20's, wishing they were that age again. Most of the critical comments here are from kids who want to demonstrate to themselves that they have outgrown this stuff. I see little basis for criticism because 'Saddle Club' is pretty much up front about what it is and it delivers what it promises. If you don't want or need a straightforward story about the values of friendship, personal responsibility, and saddle club hugs; then don't watch.

While it is true that the episodes are somewhat formulaic, full of positive values, and almost always conclude with a mandatory happy ending; the plots revolve around some very serious subjects and bad things do happen to good people. Horses die, Carol struggles to come to terms with her mother's death, kids make mistakes that have serious negative consequences for themselves and others, and people that the kids are very fond of go away. It is not as lightweight as it first appears.

The show is amazingly strong on all areas of technical production. The camera shots are often very tight on the characters' faces and lots of reaction shots are used, the audio is excellent, and the editing is fast-paced and logically sequenced. Most shows could learn a lot from the way 'Saddle Club' is shot and edited.

The acting is a little weak, especially by the supporting characters. But Lara Marshall (Lisa), Keenan MacWilliams (Carol), and Heli Simpson (Veronica) are all solid. If they weren't solid they would not survive all those close-ups and reaction shots, the director would have abandoned his tight shot style since it exposes acting weakness.

The real gem of this cast is Zachary Bennett's little sister Sophie (Stevie). She looks like an expressive Lindsey Lohen and has made her character the most interesting of the group. Sometimes this is a self-fulfilling process as the writers pick up on who is the strongest actor and place more demands on them. Bennett is a fine dramatic actress who also teams well with Heli Simpson for comic relief. And Stevie's unlikely semi-romance with Phil has a strangely 'real' feel to it.

together we are, brighter than the sun; together we are, the calm inside the storm;

together we are, everything we need; together we are, more than the sum of us

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1119830400,8,2951,4.7952755905511815
1896566,5,B00009WNWF,"Another excellent Saddle Club movie! It's soooo great! It's about kids, teens, and horses and will make you laugh so hard! Many of the actors have Australian accents addining more fun to the movie. It is a bit corny and unrealistic at times, but it's sooooo FUNNY and sooooo wonderful! The day it was delivered to our house we went absolutely crazy we were so excited!

***HERE'S A  BASIC PLOT***

Lisa comes to Pine Hollow for the first time and Veroncia immediately tries to become her friend. Then Veronica does something really bad and dangerous to hurt Stevie and Comanche. Lisa helps her out and she Carole and Stevie become friends (obviously) and Veronica hates them. They go on an overnight camping trip and while they're their they meet Phil Marsten, eat Max's magnificent marvelous, meaty, mouth watering, mountain trail chili, and have the adventure of lifetime. It is sooooo awesome. That's the basic plot w/o giving too much away.

***GREAT LINES, GOOD TIMES***

There are also some more gr8 lines:

(Lisa playing clarinet) Melanie: You sound like your killing a duck!

""You don't have to spend time with horses to know that they don't like being hit by a car""

""Whaaa whaaaaaaa let her hold on next time!""

""99 pieces of tack left to clean, 99 pieces of tack, you take one down pass it around, 98 pieces of tack left to clean""

""I really like you---your instructor Max.""

All in all, this is another amazing saddle club movie that's a must see. Also, be sure to check out the music. GOTO [...]

The SC airs on Discovery Kids Channel, check that out too!",1100217600,,1568,4.661818181818182

Heli Simpson who played Veronica got a bit boring she ahd the same expressions on the entire time!
Keenan MacWilliam waas really very lacking in the actind department.
Lara Marshall was lright but not very good
Sophie Bennett was just fantastic! She always gave her character a new sence of creativity and was so real!
I would suggest people who are looking for a new teen great star look at Sophie Bennett this girl has sooo much going for her and is so multi talented!
Brett Tucker was great as the head of the stables
and overall ti was a great movie",1074902400,2,808,4.429530201342282
1896568,1,B00009WNWF,"I haven't seen it or anything, but I can tell by the way the last movie was made it will be a terrible dissapointment...just bits and pieces of the episodes cut and pasted together and sold as a movie. The acting is fake, the riding is less than mediocre, and it deviates so far from the plot line of the books you can only tell that is is actually the Saddle Club by the names and the title. The only half-way worth-while part I suppose would be the special features, done by girls that actually KNOW horses.",1074384000,,509,4.257731958762887
1896569,2,B00009WNWF,"My daughter watches this excellent show all the time.  We have taped several episodes and were thrilled to see a ""new"" movie.
Well, after searching for weeks and finally finding it, we get it home and the ""movie"" is several of the old episodes.  Since the girls are now teenagers on the tv series, we believed this to be a sequal so-to-speak from their last movie.  The only part my daughter watches is the extras by some girls who really ride and care for their horses at a stable.  To someone who has never seen the show, they would be very happy with it.  But to those of us who have been fans for years, it was a disappointment.",1065830400,,632,4.277310924369748

7994156,4,B00009WNWF,"I bought the DVD for our granddaughter, but I enjoyed it as much as she did.  The characters are a little stereotyped, but you can still identify with them as they deal with their problems.  The horses are gorgeous, the setting is beautiful, the riding stable is terrific, and the story is engaging.  All in all, an enjoyable film!",1214352000,,331,4.576271186440678
