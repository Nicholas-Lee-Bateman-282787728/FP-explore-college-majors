8325785,5,B000UWJ4S2,"There are times in life where ""holy grail"" product become available, and this is one such product.  This all color footage was shot in 1945 on the Western Front in Europe.  Not only does this footage have US Fighters and Bombers (medium bombers, B-26s mainly), but has airfield equipment, devastated German towns, and captured and wrecked German aircraft.  Top notch color footage.. over three hours!  This footage is raw, direct from the National Archives.  I have ordered similar footage from NARA, costing me over $200 for the copy, but this partnership w Amazon brings the average history buff this footage for a fraction of the cost.  Kudos to Amazon and NARA.. looking forward to more great footage in the future!",1198627200,2,719,4.95
