8294134,3,B000067JCM,"Because you don't see rappers rap ( Ice T and other fellows are just there to show they're there)..ok you have a video clip by Royce Da Five Nine at the end...and the ""honeys"". well it's up to each one to make an opinion...",1188950400,,223,4.090909090909091
8294135,2,B000067JCM,"Reminiscent of Playboy's series of cheesy soft-core porn videos (the kind designed not to upset old folks or conservative types being naughty for the weekend by renting a ""dirty"" video), but simply more sleazy. They even got a fur coat in there. Demonstrates most of the tacky techniques used in cheap porno videos to feign sexual arousal, complete with lip-licking and un-convincing badly acted girl-on-girl sequences which merely convince the discerning viewer that no one acting in this DVD is actually turned-on. The majority of the women in this video are silicone enhanced. If you're expecting great hip-hop dancing or beautiful black babes, you'll find none of the former and few of the latter. Walk into any strip-joint, including those with sawdust on the floor, and you'll see better nude dancing than this. A fair number of minutes of footage are wasted interviewing guys boasting about their Gucci shoes or expensive watches; ho-hum. I was hoping to see beautiful women (preferably African-American) dancing good, sexy, nude hip-hop. This DVD just doesn't have it and was an (expensive) disappointment.",1149379200,5,1114,5.264044943820225

8294137,5,B000067JCM,"After hearing rave reviews about this in VH1'S special ""Rock and Hip-hop in Porn"" I decided to get it, just to see what it was all about.  I admit I was hesitant at first, thinking that it would be like all those other DVD'S about females showing what they got (i.e. Girls Gone Wild), but when I saw it I was really surprised.  The production on the dvd is excellent, the women are beautiful, and the beats are good, with such appreances as ICE T, DJ premiere, DJ Tony Touch. Basically the DVD is filled with beautiful women of all ethnic backrounds (Which you may have seen in some music videos) dancing to some nice beats and showing every part of their bodies. The camera angles were good, and there was even a soft-core girl on girl action towards the end.  Once small thing I didn't like was a promoter for game ...Anakyle (or however you spell his name) doing a freestyle at the end. Guy was horrible. Other than that this is one of the best DVDS out there, so I would definitly recommend this, and I would definitly get the next one coming out in Jan. 2003.",1038268800,24,1064,4.336683417085427
