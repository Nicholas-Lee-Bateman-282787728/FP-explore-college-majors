3134132,3,B0014S31A8,"I like Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald a lot, so when I saw this 2005 TV movie as a DVD I snapped it up. At first I thought it was a theatrical release I had somehow missed- and right away I thought it seemed a bit ""thin."" I looked it up on IMDb and saw it was a TV movie- and it made sense. I merely lowered my ""cinematic"" expectations a bit, and it was fine. Macdonald and Nighy are so appealing they helped me not care, overly, about the rather goofy plot: A gorgeous twenty-something falling madly and sexually in love with a charming but really elderly stranger she met by chance in a cafe. Then after a few days she follows him to Iceland as he plays a minor role on the British delegation to G-8. Then she plays the Innocent who shames the British G-8 delegates to adopt radical human rights proposals, thus paving the way to worldwide social justice. Hmmmm. A little far-fetched! But the ham-fistedly delivered political message of the movie is laudable enough, if a bit vague. Nighy plays a dweeb- and he's so good one would think he actually WAS a dweeb if one hadn't seen him in other roles, such as ""Love Actually"" (coincidentally filmed concurrently with this) and the original British version of ""State of Play."" And Macdonald is, as always a delight to watch, even if in a somewhat awkward and threadbare film.",1355097600,2,1324,4.4526748971193415
3134133,5,B0014S31A8,"A film of transcendent subtleties that will mostly escape those who do not see what is really happening, who seem to include the gentleman below who is still unaware of the source of the heroine's interfering determination to give the cynical G8 diplomats a piece of her mind about their neglect of the world's needlesly dying millions of children (it is that she herself lost her child to an abusive father).

Among many other unique pleasures this film offers is the extreme shyness of the top bureaucrat who though he knows the facts and figures of his brief to the last detail is bound hand and foot emotionally when it comes to the influence of his budding romance with someone equally sensitive and reserved and far younger, which allows the relationship between spring and autumn to be one of great mutual respect and not at all one of In Human Bondage which is the way almost all movies have dealt with the topic in the past.

What's said is witty and what's unsaid is telling in this marvelous reminder that in movies as in life it is often the quiet water that runs deepest and most strongly.  But youi have to be an emotionally enlightened soul to enjoy it.  Subtlety is not a democracy.",1121126400,,1198,4.58411214953271
3134134,3,B0014S31A8,"Bill Nighy is a British Civil servant who meets a cute girl played by Kelly MacDonald.  Nighy is on his way to the G-8 Summit, and he decides to take Kelly's character Gina along as a traveling companion.  Now you have to suspend your disbelief.  It is no harder than believing you see a thousand ships in front of the walls of Troy.  What follows is a tender love story leavened with a spoonful of social change commentary.  The young woman is admitted to the dinners at the Summit with the Civil Servant who is there to help negotiate a treaty on poverty.  The agenda is much like the Summit of G-8 in Gleneagles, Scotland, July 2005.  The story ends with a surprise.  It is all a little sappy, but the story is played well by a really good cast.

3134136,4,B0014S31A8,"HBO proves once again that great movies are made for TV.  This very timely and poignant film, set against the backdrop of the 2005 G8 Summit, is a mix of romance and politics that both entertains and povokes.  Think Love Actually meets Lost in Translation and CSPANs Road to the Whitehouse.  Bill Nighty (Love Actually) is brillant as a charmingly pathetic bureaucrat who goes against his past socially withdrawn tendencies in to find companionship with Kelly Macdonald.  Richard Curtis(Love Actually, as well) does a fantastic job of melding current affairs into a wonderfully written script.  Great settings, great dialogue.  A must see.",1120521600,11,639,5.215686274509804
3134137,2,B0014S31A8,"This is a movie, just released on US television, that requires you to suspend disbelief while at the same time telling a story rooted in a very real world about very real events that occur in 2005.  It is about Lawrence, an aging British Civil Servant who is so socially awkward that he looks away from the only other person at the table and does this during an entire meal.  He is played by Bill Nighy, who does a superb acting job, as does Kelly MacDonald as Gina, a young woman that he meets in a caf only because the seat across from her is the only one left during lunch.

They meet several more times but their relationship, while romantic, never progresses beyond a kiss.  Then out of the blue, he invites her to go to the G8 Summit with him (in Reykjavik), knowing absolutely nothing about her.  (Suspend disbelief, please-the British or US Secret Service would never have allowed her to get through their security, which becomes obvious at the end.)

The movie then sets up a conflict between Lawrence the Civil Servant, the real politics of a G8 meeting, and Gina, an otherwise shy woman who has very strong opinions about world poverty and doesn't hesitate to tell a British Cabinet Minister (Lawrence's boss) about them--repeatedly.  This is where the movie breaks down in terms of reality.  She repeatedly jeopardizes Lawrence's career by challenging the Minister, his German counterpart, and ultimately, the British Prime Minister, while Lawrence does nothing, even after he has been strongly warned, upon threat of dismissal, that she cannot be allowed to tell anyone off and that she should be sent back to the UK immediately.

By the end of the movie, (93 minutes), their relationship is not allowed to develop to the point where you feel anything towards Gina or Lawrence, nor do you understand why Lawrence is willing to toss a long career into the trash when he can't remember her last name at the hotel check-in in Iceland.  The director tries to extract something at the end that is supposed to give all this some meaning, and I leave it to you to decide if he does.  The movie does give you pause to think about world poverty, but since the event it emulates has already occurred, (and this movie is very event-specific) it loses some of its punch.",1120435200,6,2271,4.666666666666667
3134138,4,B0014S31A8,"I saw this the other night at it's televsion debut. And I have to say it was a wounderful story. Though it covers a serious topic, poverty and the G-8.  I am sure that screenwriter Richard Curtis wrote this so that it would be released in time for everone to see it before the G-8 summit. And I hope they saw it. The G-8 summit was the weekend of 2 July 2005.

The film is a Romantic Comedy staring Bill Nighy as Lawrence, a financial advisor working for the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the U.K. And co-stars Kelly Macdonald as Gina, the young woman Lawrence meets in the Cafe. This unlikely couple strikes up a relationship of sorts. And Lawrence invites Gina to accompany him to Iceland, where he is attending the G-8 summit. Gina shows a genuine interest in Lawerence's work and she starts to make comments based on what she has learned from him. This ends up jeopardizing Lawrenes job. He has to decide what is more important, what may be his own happines or the career he spent years building.

The movie does get its political message out. Which I believe was to point out how important the G-8 summit is. And the power the eight members have to end world poverty. In the end though, I could not give it five stars because the fate of the desperate lives of Third World residents just cannot let you enjoy the story about two awkwardly shy people reaching out for each other. But given the subject matter the acting is superb, as is the direction. I do plan to buy the DvD if it is ever released.",1120348800,11,1505,4.367857142857143

3134140,5,B0014S31A8,"Bill Nighy's dramatic range is extraordinary. He can play damn near any role and captivate his audience.

3134141,2,B0014S31A8,"I have no idea whether this is a good movie. It started well, but after that, I'm clueless. I rented the DVD disc but was unable to watch much of it on either my HP computer or my DVD player. Technically, the HBO disc is annoying. Most movies have previews or otherwise have excerpts advertising other of the distributor's movie offeringss. In most cases one can select Main Menu to bypass that and cut to the chase. Here, there is no bypass. Then, after two minutes of wasted time, I went into setup, and opted for English subtitles. It's British. This helps, as least temporarily, with getting characters' names straight. Last night, I played a little, and then the DVD froze. Tonight, having cleaned the disk of smudges, and once the advertising was behind me and setup was accomplished, I selected DVD chapter 2 to get to approximately where I'd left off before the freeze. The DVD wouldn't go to Chapter 2. I ejected it, reloaded it, waited through the advertising again, re-did the setup, and this time selected Play Movie. Nothing. Zilch. Ejected the DVD again, and took it to a trustworthy portable DVD player. There, it froze in the middle of setup. This DVD doesn't appear to have been rented that much. What scratches I see don't look like they should be crippling viewing. Some DVD manufacturers/designers/programmers just seem to know how to do things better, more userfriendly-like. This is not the case so far, here. I will try again after another disc cleaning, but it looks like a lemon technically. The DVD appears to be more frail in its design than most. So I'm not fond of, in this case, HBO as DVD issuer and/or manufacturer.",1437782400,,1647,4.70242214532872
3134142,1,B0014S31A8,"Everything that could be wrong in a movie. The protagonist is inert. There is very little story development. The woman in the film is the only one with a sense of purpose, and in the process of taking the action she takes, she destroys her lover's career without a second thought. And that's supposed to be fine with him and with us. Worst of all is the assumption that the G8 countries have the charter and power to determine the fate of the world. This is English arrogance at its worst, brought to you by the same folks who thought the British Empire was the salvation of mankind. An obnoxious film in every respect.",1432512000,,619,4.43859649122807
3134143,4,B0014S31A8,"I am not normally a fan of romance movies, but enjoyed this one.  It's not a typical romance.  I only watched it to begin with to see Kelly Macdonald, whom I really liked in ""State of Play"" (the original English version) where she also played against Bill Nighy.  Both of them play entirely different rolls here.  An added plus is Ken Stott, whom I really liked in ""Rebus"", based on the detective novels of Ian Rankin.  I also like Kelly Macdonald in ""Trainspotting"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" (where the girl from Glasgow plays a Texas trailer-park house wife), but if you like romances you won't like those movies.",1432339200,,618,4.581818181818182

3134151,4,B0014S31A8,"This movie starts out slow. You don't expect a movie to start out with absolutely no dialogue.

Even after the two main characters met, I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with this movie, but it does get better.

Not only does it have a lot of comedic moments, it is also a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the G8 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland.

I normally don't enjoy movies that look at political situations, but this look at the G8 was delightful, as our heroine relates with and debates information that is presented to her at social occasions behind the scenes at the summit.

I didn't give this movie five stars because I really do not want to watch this a second time, like I do many other movies, but it is still a good movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if I don't watch it again in a few years.

I highly recommend this film to your comedic/dramatic/ironic interests.",1417910400,,881,4.380368098159509

3134165,4,B0014S31A8,"The Girl in the Cafe is a combination political drama, about the attempts of the world's governments to end extreme poverty and a May-December love story, with Bill Nighy as a shy and idealistic British government official and Kelly Macdonald as the much younger girl he falls awkwardly in love with.  The love story is well done, with the acting excellent, and since part of the story is set at a government conference in Iceland, we get some spectacular Icelandic scenery included.  The film is worth watching for these elements, and can be especially recommended to those who liked the original British version of the TV series State of Play, since The Girl in the Cafe features the same director (David Yates) and two of the same lead actors (Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald.)

On the down side, the film has been criticized for a naive and simplistic view of how to address world poverty.  In my opinion, the criticism is largely valid.  The film suffers from what I'd call the Scrooge fantasy:  that if the powerful people at the top would just show a little more humanity, the wretched of the earth would be just fine.  No they wouldn't: economic injustice isn't caused by the inhumanity of the people who are rich, it's caused by the inhumanity of the system that makes and keeps them rich.

This review is based on the 2005 standard HBO DVD, which has very good image and sound quality.  There apparently is a later release; I don't know if it's any different.",1383868800,,1468,4.658914728682171

3134167,5,B0014S31A8,"This has a low key, very sly and subtle script allowing for many smiles and laugh out loud sequences to offset the serious drama of engaging high stakes international policy making.  It embraces a few days of a relationship between two lonely and sad people who decide to spend some time lighting up each others lives.  The acting and dialogue are so well timed and delivered that one could easily miss how expressive the major characters deliver the goods.  The story line is believable and there are no ""how could that really happen"" moments to dispense with.  Bill Nighy's physical propensities are hilarious although understated, I suppose.  Kelly MacDonald is very good looking which was only moderately used within the context of the film.  Her facial expressions were used rather than dialogue in many of the more moving, thought provoking scenes.  This film reminds me of the older genre of film making where nuance reigned and the films required apt attention to detail to pick up the full story.  I just love this film!",1369785600,21,1029,4.873563218390805
3134168,3,B0014S31A8,"I had seen this film on cable TV several years ago and decided to buy the DVD because I enjoyed the depiction of the relationship between an introverted British bureacrat and an extroverted young  woman, some years his junior, who he meets serrendipitously in a cafe. He's one of those people who labor over every sentence, working it and shaping it in their minds, so it either comes out in tortured fashion, or not at all. The relationship between these two very opposite people is the heart of the film. In a burst of courage, the bureacrat asks the young woman to accompany him on a very important business trip. He must attend the G-8 Summit in Iceland. He is the numbers cruncher for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Once they arrive in Iceland, the film takes a political turn. It turns the young woman into a lecturer, not only to the ministers of the developed world, but to the viewing audience. I am a political conservative and found this leftist lecture sophmoric and not very entertaining. I said I had seen the film several years prior, but I had forgotten how much of it was devoted to the theme of ""why can't the developed world divest themselves of a significant portion of their wealth to help the poor?"" Although most people on the left, especially those who have no wealth, have no trouble with this question, those of us who consider the flipside of the question, i.e. who's wealth is going to be confiscated, who's going to decide who's wealth is going to be confiscated and how much of their wealth is going to be confiscated? These thorny questions are naturally not raised in the screenplay. They seldom are. But back to the film: politicizing the move to the degree it does not only kills the entertainment value derived from the relationship of the bureacrat and the young woman, it infuriates those who were hoping what had begun as a rather sweet film would not turn into ""The Sorrow and the Pity."" I have no objection to the filmmaker using the young woman's politics as a dramatic device, but a satisfying conclusion to this May-November romance is lost and the film ends not in triumph, but with a whimper. What angers me the most is that Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald's performances were terrific and the film began so well. Yes the plight of the poor is worth highlighting, but in this case, politics highjacked romance and all but the most politically lefist viewers will be disappointed.",1367280000,,2425,4.66588785046729

She repeatedly jeopardizes Lawrence's career by challenging the Minister, his German counterpart, and ultimately, the British Prime Minister, while Lawrence does nothing, even after he has been strongly warned, upon threat of dismissal, that she cannot be allowed to tell anyone off and that she should be sent back to the UK immediately.

By the end of the movie, (93 minutes), their relationship is not allowed to develop to the point where you feel anything towards Gina or Lawrence, nor do you understand why Lawrence is willing to toss a long career into the trash when he can't remember her last name at the hotel check-in in Iceland.  The director tries to extract something at the end that is supposed to give all this some meaning, and I leave it to you to decide if he does.  The movie does give you pause to think about world poverty, but since the event it emulates has already occurred, (and this movie is very event-specific) it loses some of its punch.",1120435200,6,2271,4.666666666666667
3368635,4,B0014S31A8,"I saw this the other night at it's televsion debut. And I have to say it was a wounderful story. Though it covers a serious topic, poverty and the G-8.  I am sure that screenwriter Richard Curtis wrote this so that it would be released in time for everone to see it before the G-8 summit. And I hope they saw it. The G-8 summit was the weekend of 2 July 2005.

The film is a Romantic Comedy staring Bill Nighy as Lawrence, a financial advisor working for the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the U.K. And co-stars Kelly Macdonald as Gina, the young woman Lawrence meets in the Cafe. This unlikely couple strikes up a relationship of sorts. And Lawrence invites Gina to accompany him to Iceland, where he is attending the G-8 summit. Gina shows a genuine interest in Lawerence's work and she starts to make comments based on what she has learned from him. This ends up jeopardizing Lawrenes job. He has to decide what is more important, what may be his own happines or the career he spent years building.

The movie does get its political message out. Which I believe was to point out how important the G-8 summit is. And the power the eight members have to end world poverty. In the end though, I could not give it five stars because the fate of the desperate lives of Third World residents just cannot let you enjoy the story about two awkwardly shy people reaching out for each other. But given the subject matter the acting is superb, as is the direction. I do plan to buy the DvD if it is ever released.",1120348800,11,1505,4.367857142857143

3368638,2,B0014S31A8,"I have no idea whether this is a good movie. It started well, but after that, I'm clueless. I rented the DVD disc but was unable to watch much of it on either my HP computer or my DVD player. Technically, the HBO disc is annoying. Most movies have previews or otherwise have excerpts advertising other of the distributor's movie offeringss. In most cases one can select Main Menu to bypass that and cut to the chase. Here, there is no bypass. Then, after two minutes of wasted time, I went into setup, and opted for English subtitles. It's British. This helps, as least temporarily, with getting characters' names straight. Last night, I played a little, and then the DVD froze. Tonight, having cleaned the disk of smudges, and once the advertising was behind me and setup was accomplished, I selected DVD chapter 2 to get to approximately where I'd left off before the freeze. The DVD wouldn't go to Chapter 2. I ejected it, reloaded it, waited through the advertising again, re-did the setup, and this time selected Play Movie. Nothing. Zilch. Ejected the DVD again, and took it to a trustworthy portable DVD player. There, it froze in the middle of setup. This DVD doesn't appear to have been rented that much. What scratches I see don't look like they should be crippling viewing. Some DVD manufacturers/designers/programmers just seem to know how to do things better, more userfriendly-like. This is not the case so far, here. I will try again after another disc cleaning, but it looks like a lemon technically. The DVD appears to be more frail in its design than most. So I'm not fond of, in this case, HBO as DVD issuer and/or manufacturer.",1437782400,,1647,4.70242214532872

The woman in the film is the only one with a sense of purpose, and in the process of taking the action she takes, she destroys her lover's career without a second thought. And that's supposed to be fine with him and with us. Worst of all is the assumption that the G8 countries have the charter and power to determine the fate of the world. This is English arrogance at its worst, brought to you by the same folks who thought the British Empire was the salvation of mankind.

3368648,4,B0014S31A8,"This movie starts out slow. You don't expect a movie to start out with absolutely no dialogue.

Even after the two main characters met, I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with this movie, but it does get better.

Not only does it have a lot of comedic moments, it is also a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the G8 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland.

I normally don't enjoy movies that look at political situations, but this look at the G8 was delightful, as our heroine relates with and debates information that is presented to her at social occasions behind the scenes at the summit.

I didn't give this movie five stars because I really do not want to watch this a second time, like I do many other movies, but it is still a good movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if I don't watch it again in a few years.

3368662,4,B0014S31A8,"The Girl in the Cafe is a combination political drama, about the attempts of the world's governments to end extreme poverty and a May-December love story, with Bill Nighy as a shy and idealistic British government official and Kelly Macdonald as the much younger girl he falls awkwardly in love with.  The love story is well done, with the acting excellent, and since part of the story is set at a government conference in Iceland, we get some spectacular Icelandic scenery included.  The film is worth watching for these elements, and can be especially recommended to those who liked the original British version of the TV series State of Play, since The Girl in the Cafe features the same director (David Yates) and two of the same lead actors (Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald.)

On the down side, the film has been criticized for a naive and simplistic view of how to address world poverty.  In my opinion, the criticism is largely valid.  The film suffers from what I'd call the Scrooge fantasy:  that if the powerful people at the top would just show a little more humanity, the wretched of the earth would be just fine.  No they wouldn't: economic injustice isn't caused by the inhumanity of the people who are rich, it's caused by the inhumanity of the system that makes and keeps them rich.

This review is based on the 2005 standard HBO DVD, which has very good image and sound quality.  There apparently is a later release; I don't know if it's any different.",1383868800,,1468,4.658914728682171

3368664,5,B0014S31A8,"This has a low key, very sly and subtle script allowing for many smiles and laugh out loud sequences to offset the serious drama of engaging high stakes international policy making.  It embraces a few days of a relationship between two lonely and sad people who decide to spend some time lighting up each others lives.  The acting and dialogue are so well timed and delivered that one could easily miss how expressive the major characters deliver the goods.  The story line is believable and there are no ""how could that really happen"" moments to dispense with.  Bill Nighy's physical propensities are hilarious although understated, I suppose.  Kelly MacDonald is very good looking which was only moderately used within the context of the film.  Her facial expressions were used rather than dialogue in many of the more moving, thought provoking scenes.  This film reminds me of the older genre of film making where nuance reigned and the films required apt attention to detail to pick up the full story.

3368665,3,B0014S31A8,"I had seen this film on cable TV several years ago and decided to buy the DVD because I enjoyed the depiction of the relationship between an introverted British bureacrat and an extroverted young  woman, some years his junior, who he meets serrendipitously in a cafe. He's one of those people who labor over every sentence, working it and shaping it in their minds, so it either comes out in tortured fashion, or not at all. The relationship between these two very opposite people is the heart of the film. In a burst of courage, the bureacrat asks the young woman to accompany him on a very important business trip. He must attend the G-8 Summit in Iceland. He is the numbers cruncher for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Once they arrive in Iceland, the film takes a political turn. It turns the young woman into a lecturer, not only to the ministers of the developed world, but to the viewing audience. I am a political conservative and found this leftist lecture sophmoric and not very entertaining. I said I had seen the film several years prior, but I had forgotten how much of it was devoted to the theme of ""why can't the developed world divest themselves of a significant portion of their wealth to help the poor?"" Although most people on the left, especially those who have no wealth, have no trouble with this question, those of us who consider the flipside of the question, i.e. who's wealth is going to be confiscated, who's going to decide who's wealth is going to be confiscated and how much of their wealth is going to be confiscated? These thorny questions are naturally not raised in the screenplay. They seldom are. But back to the film: politicizing the move to the degree it does not only kills the entertainment value derived from the relationship of the bureacrat and the young woman, it infuriates those who were hoping what had begun as a rather sweet film would not turn into ""The Sorrow and the Pity."" I have no objection to the filmmaker using the young woman's politics as a dramatic device, but a satisfying conclusion to this May-November romance is lost and the film ends not in triumph, but with a whimper. What angers me the most is that Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald's performances were terrific and the film began so well. Yes the plight of the poor is worth highlighting, but in this case, politics highjacked romance and all but the most politically lefist viewers will be disappointed.",1367280000,,2425,4.66588785046729
