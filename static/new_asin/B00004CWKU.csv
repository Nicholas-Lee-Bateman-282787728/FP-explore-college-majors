1339239,5,B00004CWKU,Probably one of the best movies to show the courage and quiet strength of the British at their best.  The determination of the civilian public at the time not to leave one of their own service men behind to be taken prisoner is well documented and brought to life brilliantly in this movie.  And you have a genuine interest in the characters and their survival.  This movie needs to be brought out in US Format.,1200787200,13,411,4.453333333333333
1339240,5,B00004CWKU,"One of the best war movies ever made. A good story, good acting and all wound around a time in the war when the destiny of the world was being decided.
John Mills plays a corporal who takes charge of his unit when their officer is killed and subsequently leads them all back to the beaches of Dunkirk and rescue.
The film also shows the pale faced bravery of the swarms of civilians in their little boats who sailed across one of the most dangerous stretches of water in the world to rescue 400'000 trapped Brit soldiers at Dunkirk. These ""men"" were aged between 14 and 75 and all volunteers. Many were killed.
Any American who wants to try and understand the strange Brit mentality should watch both ""Dunkirk"" and ""The Battle of Britain"" and then decide in ""the special relationship"", who owes whom what?
Forget the history, buy the movie and enjoy!",1191369600,18,850,4.562091503267974

1339341,3,B00004CWKU,From a historical point it is an excellent representation actual events. Amazon was a little slick because I thought is was the 2017 movie in new releases and they charged more than they should have.

1339365,5,B00004CWKU,"This has long been one of my favorite films dealing with the war in Europe. It has a great cast: Sir John Mills (THE British Everyman of World War II cinema), Sir Richard Attenborough and the great Bernard Miles, as well as such familiar faces as Michael Bates (A Clockwork Orange), Lionel Jeffries (The First Men in the Moon) and Barry Foster (Hitchcock's Frenzy). This effectively captures the spirit of the Dunkirk rescue and the resolve of the British people. It can stand proudly alongside the excellent 2017 version.",1503360000,,522,4.876404494382022

I was rather disappointed with the haphazard story line (if you could call it that). So I recently rented it to watch again. Both my wife and I thought that the old movie was FAR superior.

1339403,3,B00004CWKU,"Dunkirk(1958) the Leslie Norman-directed film made by Ealing Studios(hes Barry Normans father), is a solid,worthy black and white authentic war film. Many of the actors are those you come to expect, Richard Attenboroughs selfish factory owner, Bernard Lees cynical journalist and John Mills resourceful corporal leading his band of men through the countryside, through Germans to the beach. What is noticeable about this earlier version(as opposed to Nolans IMAX recreation) about the retreat from France, is this shows more of the context and background on both sides of the Channel. In England the confusion about where the Germans are, what needs to be done, getting small boat owners to register their boats and loan them to naval people,However many boat owner civilians offer to go themselves. Theres also newsreel from the era giving a documentary feel: we learn 2 destroyers have been sunk. On the other side the British are in retreat from France and Belgium, the Germans have found ways around the Maginot line and ways through the Ardennes Forest; they are also pounding the beaches at Dunkirk with Stuka planes. The beach scenes show lots of straggling troops scattered across the sands,hiding from the bombers, but also suffering lots of losses, as they wait for the boat that will take them out. Some of the scenes by the mole, and on the ships, which get sunk and men jumping almost seem the same as those in the new Nolan film. We also get Flanagan and Allen singing, Theyre going to hang out their washing on the Siegfried Line. Worth seeing.",1501286400,,1559,4.9541984732824424

1339407,5,B00004CWKU,Sturdy war drama that holds up well.  John Mills (then about age 50) was a bit old to be playing a BEF corporal but he brings it off.  Some of the other roles verge on stereotypical stiff upper lip.,1498435200,,198,4.051282051282051
1339408,5,B00004CWKU,"Excellent, intelligent, beautifully photographed, and historically accurate telling of the Dunkirk tale, featuring a typically sterling British cast and wonderful musical score by Sir Malcolm Arnold, whose movements concerning the Royal Navy are particularly well done.

1339411,3,B00004CWKU,"this is one of the films in what is called ""the war collection"" by Studio Canal. They are b&w , region 2, and non-captioned. This one does a good job of conveying the magnitude of the extraction/rescue of 340,000 allied troops trapped on the northern France beach at Dunkirk. This was accomplished in nine days by a fleet of 800 boats of all shapes and sizes, many of them private and manned by the owners. Another strategic blunder by Hitler who thought evacuation impossible and surrender their only option. Too late he sent troops to force the issue. Thus ended an ill-fated campaign in which 100,000 allied troops were killed or captured in their retreat out of the lowlands and France to the beach.",1486684800,,703,4.67741935483871

1339423,5,B00004CWKU,"Some may think that old war movies can not be compared with the modern ones because of the lack of super high-tech effects and millions of dollars which current productions have in abundance. Although it is true that no old movie can give you the terrific visual effects of ""Saving Private Ryan"" they do have some advantages, especially when the theme is about World War II. First of all, they were closer to the real time of the war, thus the heroes, the faces, the mentality, the materials, the surroundings and above all the language are much more realistic than any modern director could ever hope for no matter how much money has at his/her disposal. ""Dunkirk"" belongs to this category of excellent old British war films, picturing the drama of the defeated BEF in 1940, through the story of a British corporal and his small team of soldiers, and also through the story of British civilians who not only offered their small boats to the service of the army and the Royal Navy but they volunteered also to ride them straight to the Dunkirk beaches and back  and paid the ultimate price sometimes! There are good scenes of battles, of the terrible bombardment by the Luftwaffe  and the ships' desperate efforts to reach the beaches. Those old days the directors had numerous authentic weapons, guns, trucks, destroyers, airplanes etc and they used them in a marvellous way!",1483920000,2,1376,4.777310924369748

1339431,5,B00004CWKU,"In 1940 British Troops (10 Divisions) joined up with the Belgian and French armies to defend France from the advancing
German Forces, the operation failed badly around 400,000 troops were pushed back and subsequently cornered on the
beaches at Dunkirk.
With the fight lost and equipment abandoned the Troops on the beaches were being picked-off at will by the German
luftwaffa, at this point in time the war could well have been lost.
The call went out to boat-owners to volunteer their craft and indeed themselves to join with 39 destroyers to lift the stricken
troops from the beaches, a brave and bold move.
In the event over 800 boats joined the destroyers in the evacuation attempt, many would never return to British Shores of
course, however most did, the eight day operation rescued nearly 340,000 British and Allied troops.
This British-made movie reflects the events leading up to and during what had been called 'Operation Dynamo'
With an impressive cast-line-up including - 'John Mills' - 'Richard Attenborough' - 'Bernard Lee' - 'Robert Urquhart' and 'Ray
Jackson' along with a host of familiar faces in this 1958 'Leslie Norman' Film.
The film portrays the heroics of the few covering the retreat to the tension on the beaches with the commanders trying to give
hope to their troops in the face of repeated air attacks when in truth all on the beaches feared either death or capture.
Whist back on Britain's South-Coast a daring and ambitious rescue attempt is planned.
The crossing of the English-Channel in small boats dangerous at the best of times, the rescuers also risked their lives from the
attack from the skies if indeed they reached Dunkirk's beaches.
The film captures the atmosphere of the conditions on the beaches as the troops had little hope of survival, also the acts of
bravery from those who joined in the unlikely rescue-attempt.
A well portrayed film of it's day capturing that moment in history.",1459728000,4,1932,4.947692307692308

It has the typical buddy/small unit war film format---in its day not so hackneyed or tired, but today viewers will be coming at it differently, having seen the format over and over again.

1339463,5,B00004CWKU,"Just want to add my 5 stars to the other reviews of this great war movie. This is the most realistic and most un-Hollywood of any of the British made war movies. This is as good as any of the excellent 'Rank Organization' war movies, where the emphasis was on no bologna real feel action and drama. Some very gripping drama as a small unit of British soldiers caught behind the German breakthrough that drove the British out of Belgium and broke the French forces. I've seen other small unit action movies but this one was very gripping and showed lots of candid war action as the group tries to get back to safety. Finally they get lucky and get back to Dunkirk. The port in Dunkirk has been bombed and so has the port of Calais. There were no Higgins landing boats in the British arsenal, so the government seized all boats 30' in length or larger and organized rescue-by-night boat pick ups of the stranded troops. Many of the boat owners volunteered to drive their own boats to and from the shores, and some became casualties. Really a well done screenwrite, no stupid subplots to distract the audience. Movie was about the historical action and not the actors. You'll see good artillery barrages, German Stukas dive bombing the army and destroyers at the port, never a dull moment.",1419120000,2,1286,4.595652173913043

The best British actors and terrific cinematology of what became known as The Miracle of Dunkirk and a watershed for the British people. I would have to disagree that this is boring . . . try and imagine the reality of Dunkirk. This is a classic of the genre that offers a good storyline and is definitely worth watching.

1339471,4,B00004CWKU,"A solid film. A less expensive companion to the star studded 'The Longest Day', this film manages to have a smack of realism. Obviously, the people who made this film were actually there (The film was made less than 20 years after the events), and so watching this small unit as it marches across France to the beaches of Dunkirk has an authenticity to it. The flip side, the story of the 'little boats' is excellent as well, with coward-turned hero David Attenborough nearly stealing the film, except the gravity of Bernard Lee(you know him as M to Connery's bond) won't quite let him get away with it.
If you're interested in this corner of the war, the excellent narrative written by Hugh Sebag-Montefiore is for me the definitive account. This film manages to avoid some of the teary eyed cliche of British war time films, and little of the cynicism of later films. Highly recommend for war film fans.",1398816000,,905,4.6625

It ties in the soldiers in France and the civilians back in England very well, with a few surprises.",1348531200,6,358,4.313432835820896
1339479,4,B00004CWKU,"I love watching this film for many reasons, it's well acted and very realistic. I think it gives a very real portrayal of the situation that 300,000+ British soldiers found themselves in in 1940, and I have to admit I watch it with a slight lump in the throat every time as I think of the fact that my Grandfather was actually on that beach, waiting for his turn to be evacuated. It's inspirational to see all those civilians in their tiny pleasure boats crossing the channel time and time again to rescue them.

The Battle of Britain may have been our ""finest hour"", but the heroic efforts to bring the boys back home has to come pretty damn close as well.",1342828800,5,657,4.385245901639344
1339480,5,B00004CWKU,"This is a exceptional war movie filled with first rate performances and it remains as gripping and well mades as ever.  The effects are very good with large ships sinking and docks being blown to pieces, and bombs plastering the beachs of dunkirk.  This was not a low budget affair when it was made , it was a A movie and it was shot in black and white but it still looks great.  The ony problem is that noone had the brains enough in the united states to release this in our region. (region one) I have a all region player so I can watch this on my tv but surely this incredibly well made movie featuring the great late john mills and bernard lee and others should be out on a domestic dvd. If you want a top rate film, and have a all region dvd player. (these players are not that expensive and are on sale here on amazon.com) then this is worth adding to your 'good' war film library because it's historically accurate and engaging.",1282435200,10,935,4.241573033707865

7919986,5,B00004CWKU,"I had not watched this ""old"" movie (1958) of Dunkirk and did so based upon the very high praise in the reviewer comments at Amazon. It is very well done and actually focuses on the overall events of the Dunkirk chronology.and touches on occasion on actual subplots such as overall strategic mistakes, the so-called Phony War, whether to risk the navy's large destroyers or hold them back for a possible invasion counter-force, etc. etc. It is evidently not available as a DVD so  thankfully the digital copy is here. Surprisingly a long movie (over two hours)  but it kept my interest. This is really a great movie (I ended up purchasing  the digital copy).",1520121600,,657,4.745614035087719
