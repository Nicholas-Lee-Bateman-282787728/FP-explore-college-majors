7361515,5,B013BPR7QU,"This is one of, if not the, best box sets I own. The quality of the set is amazing. Most sets have the DVDs affixed to some cheap plastic holder, but these are kept in very sturdy sleeves in a very well-made book. The coasters and whiskey glasses are also an amazing addition that will make any die-hard fan happy.",1445212800,2,314,4.25
7361516,2,B013BPR7QU,"Just wanted to reiterate another review: it is extremely difficult to access the discs in this set.  It's impossible to do so without grabbing the front and back of the disc firmly and yanking a few times, leaving fingerprint marks on the back of the disc.  I'm worried that this will result in damage to the discs.  This seems very negligent on the manufacturer's part.  Other than that, the set is gorgeous, with the coasters and glasses being a nice touch.  I would have preferred a more practical set, however.  I'm now contemplating storing separately from the set to protect the discs, which is ridiculous.",1444953600,80,612,4.780952380952381
7361517,5,B013BPR7QU,"I'm a huge fan of the show and love all things Mad Men!

I purchased this because it was such a great deal and I knew I'd definitely re-watch the series.
Everything about the packaging is beautiful! The box is great quality and has different images on each side.
The book the discs come in is beautifully presented, however it is quite difficult to get the discs in and out of the packaging, One of the discs actually cut me while I was trying to pull it out, and I got a fingerprint on the shiny side of the disc while trying to remove it, not a huge deal, but definitely not ideal for a collector. It also comes with a digital copy of the set, but it is on ultra-violet.

The coasters are fantastic, and so are the tumblers, can't wait to use them while I re-watch the show. Cheers to the end of an era!!",1444953600,15,806,4.127388535031847

7361519,2,B013BPR7QU,"This is one of the greatest shows of all time but I have to give this product a poor review because I believe the disc booklet in my Mad Men Blu-ray set is defective.

There's a catch mechanism inside of each of the disc sleeves that is WAY TOO TIGHT. I have to grip the disc on both sides and wiggle and wobble it to yank it out, leaving a huge fingerprint on the shiny side. Then, when putting it back I have to push so hard that it feels like I am going to break, bend, or scratch the disc or the box. I feel like with enough use I could easily ruin one of the discs just by removing it.

Everything else is beautiful but i may have to get my set replaced because it is extremely hard to use for it's primary purpose.",1444694400,46,720,3.9246575342465753
7361520,5,B013BPR7QU,"This is a review of the Complete Collection and not of the show. As you can see by the Verified Purchase, I bought this and have opened it up and looked it over.

To start with, the packaging for this is great. Not too big so that it doesn't fit on the shelf easily. And not too small that you think it was cheaply made and they skimped on materials. The box itself is beautiful with different images on each side so that you're tempted to turn it around every so often to get a new image to view. It looks like they were taken in a photobooth, which is pretty cool. There's a Red/White/and Black theme. Almost as if the designers of the packaging were in love with the joke - What is White and Black and Re(a)d all over? This Mad Men Box!

Inside you will find the blu-rays as well as some really cool extra stuff. Starting from the least interesting (for me), there are four coasters. All four focus on Don Draper though one of the coasters is confusing to me as I am not sure what it actually represents - feet on a tightrope to represent the balancing act Don Draper had throughout his career? But three are definitely Don Draper. Next there is the Blu Ray Book. Other shows have done similar things where each season fits into the ""pages"" of the book and you thus have to pull out the blu-ray. I happen to like cases like that. For each season we see photos from the season as well as the titles and descriptions of the episodes on the disc. There are also quotes from the episodes. And finally are the two period glasses from Don Draper's early office days which he kept around long after others had transitioned to more modern glasses. So now when you rewatch the series you can drink like Don Draper. Well hopefully not too much like him!

The show itself is exquisitely crafted. From lighting to costumes to design and music, I loved it all. These are characters and stories that I will want to share with people I love. And while Mad Men is not my favorite show (Six Feet Under holds that place in my heart), Mad Men is still in the top three. Watching these characters and knowing I won't have any more stories about them actually causes me sadness and a little pain. This is a fitting case to remind me of the show. When I see these pictures on the case I feel like I am transported back in time to the story from which these pictures came.",1444694400,33,2352,4.2690582959641254
7361521,5,B013BPR7QU,"Yes, all 92 episodes.  Yes, all the special feature disks from the 8 previously released Season collections.  Yes all previously released audio commentaries PLUS additional new commentaries (esp for Season 6).  And Plus a bunch of new interviews and stuff you can play in the background at your 2018 Mad Men themed summer party. And Yes, the Blu-Ray is way cheaper than the DVD.

I disagree that bingeing is the way to watch.  I'm with Matthew Weiner in saying, once a week and let it steep.  It's Not Nice To Fool Mother Nature!",1444348800,35,529,4.634408602150538
7361522,5,B013BPR7QU,"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so until the very end of of 7 seasons.

Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on real life ad-man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He was a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He had it all. And yet he can never peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away. And more often than not, it succeeds.

From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par&eacute; as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.

The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the early 60's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!

This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes all seasons. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1443657600,,2524,4.688487584650113

7361525,1,B013BPR7QU,"Brilliant series, but as so many others have said, absolutely horrible packaging. The discs are crammed so tightly into their slots, it takes a real struggle to get them out or put them back in. And when we did finally pull them out, they wouldn't play on our Blu-ray (probably because they were damaged by their packaging). Just avoid the box set at all costs, and watch on a streaming service. It's a real shame, because Mad Men deserved something far better than the shoddy treatment it's gotten here..

7361526,4,B013BPR7QU,"We did not see the series as it was being aired during it's heyday.  That said, we enjoyed the series and the look back at life we grew up in during the 60s in that segment of society.  The producers and actors did a great job of capturing the sentiment and emotions of the time.  Although more progress is expected in the future, women will appreciate how far they have come in the workforce since the days of the male dominated workforce.  We thought it was interesting to follow the lives of the characters over such a long period of time and see the same actors age in their characters over the years.  All that said, it's hard to believe that folks drank and smoked in the day as much as the characters did during the show's run.  The series was excellent and is recommended to others who enjoy character development over a long period of time.",1524614400,,849,4.375796178343949

To make matters worse, they're stored in pairs without quite enough room to be able to pull out only one disk - you have to pull them both out a bit, push one back in and remove the other. Of course, when you try to pull them out, they bind against the separator and are even harder to remove.

And then, you've got greasy fingerprints all over the data side of the disk, requiring a side trip to the sink for a wash with a bit of detergent and a drying session. 3 stars due to the sleeve design.",1520985600,3,583,4.114035087719298

Because we had purchased the item three months ago (Christmas present) the seller could not replace the one glass that was defective. We heard a ""ticking"" sound went over to determine what and where the sound was coming from and found the glass cracked completely and cleanly around the silver rim. Mind you, these glasses are $49.99 for the pair. Pretty darn expensive. So the decision for the seller not to replace the defective glass is disappointing. I recommend NOT to purchase with the glasses. They are extremely delicate and will shatter without cause.

7361550,4,B013BPR7QU,"Mad Men is my favorite modern television series, hands down. The acting, the characters, the beauty and the styles never get old to these eyes. But you probably all know the show so I will review this Blu-ray box set.
The tumblers are nice quality, they look like replica glasses from Sterling Cooper & Price and they would add charm to any bar. The coasters are thick and solid as well. The book of discs looks fantastic but it is a real struggle to get a single disc out of the sleeve. I used a clean pillowcase (to avoid fingerprints) and gripped each disc individually while ""wiggling"" them out. I then put each disc partially back in, but not all the way because I will never go through this struggle again. This is a terribly designed book case that was clearly designed by a prankster that takes delight in you never actually being able to WATCH the Mad Men.set you just purchased.

Next, the cardboard coasters are a joke. They would be ruined after one use. (I was going to have friends over to watch the movies and use them, I think not.) The glasses have flaws in the glass that is very noticeable.
Last, but by no means least, the digital version code is not valid.  Very disappointing as I was going to download and watch on tv. So, don't count on that.

This is the triumph of design over practicality.  The booklet that holds the disks is a poorly thought-out mess.  You can't get the disks out of the thing without grasping the edge and getting oils from your fingers all over it.  There's then a trip to the washroom to carefully get the gum off.  The risk of deeper damage is always present.  I've only got to get the disks out once so that I can get them onto my server.  But in only the first two seasons I've already had two disks that were scratched up from being inserted at the factory.  You'll find that you have to tear the cardboard slightly even to get your fingers in.  You might decide that a trip to the office store for plastic cases is a necessary thing.

I know the designer of this package was really proud of it.  What a pity they never tried using the thing. A pricy set deserves more than a couple of glasses.",1483833600,2,1151,4.19634703196347

7361620,1,B013BPR7QU,"I'm puzzled by the good reviews. I'm also puzzled by the bad reviews that only harp on how unsympathetic the characters are, or how much they drink and smoke. Mad Men is a terrible show, but it isn't because the characters are bad people who drink too much. It's because the writing is awful. I'll attempt to enumerate the ways.

With stunning regularity, major characters are suddenly written off of the show. Paul Kinsey, Sal Romano, Max Ginsberg, Bob Benson, Jim Cutler, the list goes on and on. Of course, it's sometimes okay if characters in a show leave, die, or otherwise get written away. But in Mad Men it always feels like it's for no reason. The character hasn't finished their storyline or developed in some way, they are just suddenly gone, often without a good bye, and often in the middle of a plotline. Jim Cutler literally just disappears and is never mentioned again. It seems like sometimes the writers didn't know what to do with a character and just decided to bag it. When this happens, you feel like you wasted a huge amount of time on watching that character.

And, sadly, it isn't limited to characters - the same thing happens with entire plotlines. A large quantity of storylines go absolutely nowhere, reach unsatisfying conclusions, or are completely forgotten about. Betty's hands, Peggy's child, Glenn joining the army, the random waitress that Don spends half a season looking for, the list goes on and on. It happens so often that you start to distrust the show. On the rare occasion that a plotline is interesting, you spend most of your time worrying that it will be forgotten about. Perhaps the largest culprit in this regard is the supremely uninteresting story of Don's past. The show wastes HUGE amounts of time on this, and it is just bizarre to me. It has nothing to do with anything, doesn't fit the premise of the show, and doesn't seem to inform Don's actions or personality, except in the handful of episodes where they suddenly decide that it's super important. Need Don to do something out of character or that no normal person would do? Easy, just show a three minute flashback to his past. This would be lazy writing even if they did it correctly, but half of the time even after the flashback you still don't understand Don's motivation or reasoning.

Speaking of character development, or lack thereof, after SEVEN seasons most of the characters that have been there from the beginning are still barely developed, and the relationships between many of them are nonexistent. How does Don feel about, say, Ken Cosgrove? I don't know. How do Pete Campbell and Harry Crane get along? I don't know. And no, these aren't bit characters. Near the end of the show, Peggy shares a sentimental moment with Roger Sterling like they've been friends for years, and I caught myself trying to remember if they had ever even had a scene together before. I couldn't think of one. Maybe they did, but it speaks volumes that I can't remember it. Part of the problem here is that instead of expanding on the existing characters we know and care about, there is just a constant influx of new ones. Even in the last two episodes we were still introducing new characters and spending more time on them than some of the main ones. It's hard to care about any of these characters because a) they're new, b) there are so many, and c) you know they'll either be forgotten about or remain just as undeveloped as the rest of the existing characters. There are so many characters that in any given episode about half of them don't appear because there wouldn't be enough time to show them all. Even Peggy, who is probably the second most important character, is only in about half of the episodes. It's ridiculous.

Another insurmountable obstacle to any kind of character or storyline development is Don's insistence on constantly leaving Manhattan, where the show is set. About once a season, Don packs up and heads off on some completely pointless sojourn, typically to California. We abandon everything else going on and get to be bored to tears by his aimless wandering and endless encounters with random characters we don't know or care about. This might be the most exhausting part of the show. Just why? The whole second half of the last season is comprised of this nonsense, which makes for a very disappointing ending to a very disappointing show.

On the topic of setting, the show is set in the 1960's. But the setting is entirely irrelevant other than constantly beating us over the head with hamfisted ""remember this product/invention we don't use anymore?"" and ""check out this retro outfit"" and ""wasn't it racist/sexist back then?"" moments. The latter is particularly annoying because they exaggerate it so much. At times, it seems like every male character is a chain-smoking alcoholic that can't say anything asexual or non-condescending to their female coworkers, all so that the audience can smugly sit back and say, ""I sure am glad that we advanced beings of the future don't behave like THAT anymore."" Please. The show doesn't tackle the subjects of technological or social advancement in any kind of meaningful or thoughtful way.

Finally, there are a number of characters that are very annoying and difficult to watch. The primary offender here is Sally, Don's daughter. She is just insufferable. I'm sick of movies and TV shows always writing in the precocious, strong child that, in a way, is smarter than all of the adults. Kids are stupid and don't know anything. I don't want to watch a 12 year old girl parade around with an attitude while her parents refuse to discipline her. Betty, Don's wife, is almost as infuriating. Also, she is a noticeably bad actress. She delivers her lines in a very stilted and ""reading from a script"" kind of way, and it gets distracting. On that note, the actor that plays Pete has the exact same problem. They're not TERRIBLE but between the two of them I couldn't believe I was watching a big-budget critically acclaimed TV show. I rarely complain about acting.

In the end, I have no idea how or why I slogged through seven seasons of this garbage. The destination was nowhere and the ride wasn't enjoyable. Save yourself the pain.",1472947200,3,6215,4.759740259740259

7361624,4,B013BPR7QU,"For months I put off buying this set, because of all the one-star reviews on Amazon pointing out its very real design flaws. I am not here to say that the design flaws aren't ridiculously stupid (whoever gave the thumbs up for producing them probably cost the company tens of thousands of dollars in sales).

But I am here to tell you that you don't have to ruin the book and/or the discs to get them out. Especially if you're fine with storing them separately once they're out. In fact, a CD book fits very nicely within the box that holds the glasses, so you can still store everything in the same place.

I combined the collected wisdom of other Amazon reviewers to come up with a technique that worked very well for me:
1) (IMPORTANT!) use a clean nitrile, vinyl, or latex glove to avoid getting fingerprints on the discs
2) using your non-dominant hand (assuming your span is 7"" or greater), squeeze the top and bottom parts of the page holding the discs togetherthis will raise up the page ever so slightly and make disc removal easier
3) using your gloved dominant hand, grip the edge of the disc and pull it slowly outward while simultaneously rotating it downward (another way of thinking about it is that you want to spin it towards you while pulling it out)there will be considerable resistance at first, but slowly increase the pressure while pulling and rotating and soon enough the disc will get past the narrowest point in the book and pop right out

After taking about two minutes to figure out this technique and get the first disc out safely, the others took about 3-4 seconds each to remove. All my discs are now safely stored in a separate disc-holding book, and the book that comes with this edition is still in pristine condition.

Hopefully this advice will help someone out there. It really is a great collection and the only way (currently at least) to get commentaries on all the episodes.",1470528000,5,1915,4.590643274853801

The book that the DVDs are stored in is adorable - good quality...BUT...yes there's a BUT. Everyone's complaints about the DVDs being too tight in the sleeves is 100% correct.  And the pages are too long to be able to pucker the sleeve to try to get the DVD out easier.  If you were trying to avoid a finger print on the the readable side...you're out of luck. It's going to take some maneuvering to get them out more easily...perhaps snipping the opening of the sleeve a little.  I'm surprised the makers of this box set haven't yet fixed the problem since this complaint has been going on since the set came out.  I still think it's a great set and I bought it with a gift card, so I'm not going to return it.  Update:  I found a way to get the discs out with little struggle. Grab it with one of those soft small screen cloths, pull it up till it stops and then slide it left and right while pulling, not too much pressure but don't be too delicate.  Do the same when putting it back in.  But the cloth will help with prints and nothing will break.  Hope that helps!",1466640000,50,1242,4.28755364806867

If ONE person at any point in the process had tried to remove a disc from the packaging, they would have realized that it's impossible without scuffing the discs.

I know they say you can't scratch a Blu Ray - DON'T LISTEN. I wrested two discs out of the book, as carefully as humanly possible, and BOTH discs now have points in the episodes where playback freezes.

The only reasons to get this set over the individual seasons are the slightly lower price, the new bonus disc (which features terrific new series-wrap interviews with Matt Weiner and the cast), and audio commentaries on season 6, which formerly did not have any. If you do buy this set, then my advice is to sacrifice the book. Tear it up with reckless abandon in order to get the discs out. It's a shame, because the book does look nice.

7361646,2,B013BPR7QU,"Am spending more than a few minutes ripping apart the DVD Book case in order to make it semi-functional. All too true, unfortunately other reviewers were right... the case holder is s***e. There is no main sleeve for the faux book, so there is a chance the DVDs will exit to the floor after I'm done splitting each individual sleeve with nail scissors to access the DVD treat held FIRMLY inside. I'd analyzed the pictures here and elsewhere and thought I could cure the situation. It's not easy, my friends. The white ends are stacked paper to mimic book pages. They are not thick enough, however, and actually curve around the DVD; making a hermetic seal. So, rip and tear, I am purposely destroying the pretty package - which is a darn shame. Glasses are heavy, real glass. Coasters are fine. FYI: splitting open the top margins of each slot along the plane of the stack allows access to each DVD. I will get a large rubber band to wrap around the book. Ridiculous for a product lauding great design to have such a major flaw.",1454371200,4,1028,4.532258064516129

7361650,1,B013BPR7QU,"My review concerns the design of the collection rather than the content.  The content is of course great, and if you're a fan of MadMen you will not be disappointed by it.  The design of this complete collection is terrible however.  The box has all the marks of something that was thrown together quickly to get it out in time for the holidays.  The discs are so tightly crammed into the sleeves that it takes a great amount of effort to pry them out (and is nearly impossible to do so without getting your fingerprints, or worse, scratches, all over them).  And it is equally difficult to get them back into their sleeves.

Secondly, the packaging of the box itself is poorly considered. It's obvious they threw on some pictures from the final season on the box and called it a day. No pictures of Sal or Lane for example. If someone is viewing the series for the first time, it would be a fairly obvious spoiler if they examined the box and couldn't find those characters. Plus the inside of the box is just a mess - the book of discs is nice (aside from the inability to get the discs out) but they just threw in a box with some glasses from the set (which are nice) and some cheap cardboard coasters that are similar in quality to what you would get at your average bar.

I can't help but compare the horrible design of this disc collection to that of Breaking Bad, which was very cleverly and thoughtfully designed. I understand that Matt Weiner was a stickler for detail on the set of Mad Men.  Too bad he wasn't such a stickler when it came to offering a product for the show's fans.",1453593600,17,1591,4.351351351351352

UNFORTUNATELY, this was a very nice looking presentation of the DVDs: came with two highball glasses and coasters--which I hadn't even realized but in my opinion, there are two ""flaws"" with this particular set that annoy me!  The DVDs are in a book of ""sleeves"" and it is darn near IMPOSSIBLE to get them out!  I found that using a microfiber cloth, one can ""spring"" the sleeves, reach with the cloth, and with a FIRM grip, extract the disc!  (There is a semicircle of disc showing that would allow a ""1 mm purchase"" with fingers!  The other fault may be my own Samsung Blu-Ray player, and that is when you wish to cue up the next episode, I NORMALLY would push Pause, then Stop, finally, TV off, and all would shut down--the next time you powered up the DVD player, the next episode, cued up, would start.  With THIS Blu-Ray set, I cannot use the Disc Menu button to go to the episode choice, nor is there any description of the episodes, like Mr. Selfridge et al.  The discs say ""loading"" when they start, and since my DVD player is NOT connected to the Internet, this ""problem"" that I am warning you all about may singularly be MY fault.  I will lend these to other family members, and have purchased separate jewel packs for the DVDs rather than put them back into this box.

7361673,3,B013BPR7QU,Initial Feedback 17NOV2015: As mentioned by others the discs themselves are a little tough to get out of the package but not so difficult I find it a deal breaker (Squeezing the side helped some for me). I am however annoyed beyond belief that the only option for digital downloads is through UltraViolet with no option for an iTunes copy. I am an avid user of the iTunes ecosystem and have no reason to change my ways anytime soon. As a professional in the technology industry I find it absurd to not give your customers all of the options available where those options have DRM technologies implemented. These kinds of artificial limitations only hurt the honest consumer and only provide more reason to find non-DRM enabled ways of digitizing purchased content which works contrary to the intent of the movie industry.,1447718400,19,821,4.829787234042553

 Great series, worst packaging in the history of box sets.  The box looks beautiful, but the discs are packaged in a manner that makes them extremely difficult to remove from the box- and it's impossible to get them out without directly handling both sides of the disc.

If you can manage to get the disc out without damaging it, you already know the rest. Great series, and the extras are as good as it gets.

Because of the terrible packaging, I would recommend this box for collectors only. If viewing is your primary concern, buy the individual seasons and save yourself the challenge of navigating the packaging.",1446336000,2,674,4.726495726495727

But the worst problem by a mile is the horrendous video transfer. What gives lionsgate?  The last season shouldn't look like a 1970s grind house film with grain, distortion and flaring...",1446249600,3,455,4.82051282051282
7361684,1,B013BPR7QU,"If you are even thinking about buying this, chances are you already know how great this show is. Either you've already watched the entire series as it aired or you've watched a few episodes and liked it enough to want to see it all. So yes, it's a great show. One of the best to come out in years.

And the packaging artwork for this is great. Great design, etc. The glasses and coasters are a nice touch, if maybe a bit unnecessary. But nevertheless, the whole package looks really great.

BUT...I have to reiterate what many others are saying regarding the poorly designed disc holders. It's beyond ridiculous. I feel like the discs are going to break or the pages are going to tear when I try to remove one (and even replacing them is difficult). I contacted Lionsgate to see if maybe the first batch of these were flawed and of course they defended the poor design with a canned email response:

The packaging was created in this manner to ensure the discs do not move and are not damaged within the holder.
We have found that by gripping the top and bottom of each page and gently squeezing the page open up slightly, this allows for easier grasping and remove of each individual disc.

I'm not exactly sure how you can hold the top and bottom of the page AND remove a disc at the same time. But hey, I only have two hands, maybe it's just me. This is just a design flaw, plain and simple. I'm sure they realized it right away but these books/disc holders are clearly very expensive to produce and by the time they realized how poorly they were designed it was too late to reprint them.

So the show gets 5 starts, but this set I can only give 1 star for this pretty substantial flaw. I think I'll do what others have suggested and just put the discs into a disc book or other holder.",1446163200,49,1789,4.3283582089552235

People weren't exaggerating when they said the discs are hard to get out, but I'm hoping it gets easier.
I didn't realize the box doesn't open up, but the top slips up and off. I didn't open the whole top before I did realize it though. Whew.

7361686,3,B013BPR7QU,"Fantastic design. Everything looks beautiful, from the artwork to the hardcover disc sleeve book that houses the discs themselves to even the highball glasses. Until you take a closer look. Like many of the reviews state, the disc book, though it's pretty to look at, is almost impossible to remove the discs from. You have to physically grip each disc and yank it out, which leaves a fat fingerprint on the disc. Not a huge deal, but still an inconvenience. Hopefully over the years this doesn't affect the quality of the discs/playback. The highball glasses look great at first glance, but once you take a closer look you realize they're kind of flimsy. They're the highball glasses with the silver rim much like Don uses in the show. But the craftsmanship is poor, to say the least. The silver rims on both my glasses were not straight, but slanted up and down across the rim. Unless that's the design, which I doubt. Also, the coasters that come with the set aren't great. They have cork on the bottom, which is fine. But the top is made of printed cardboard, which is not. I'm almost certain that after I use it for 4 cold drinks that the cardboard will start to fall apart.

Honestly, if you're looking for quality glassware for your imbibing needs or quality coasters, you shouldn't be looking for them in dvd box sets. But it would've still been nice to have some better quality control for these extra items. The playback for me hasn't caused any problems as of yet. I love Mad Men the show.

I've repeatedly contacted Lionsgate to complain about video pixellation or discs that fail to play after a year or two, and they've always disappointed me. First off, the discs are frustratingly difficult to remove from the packaging. The discs are essentially the same discs that have already been released over the past 7 seasons, except in a crappy booklet that doesn't allow you to remove the discs as easily. I had to press my thumb on the discs, use my fingers to pull apart the cardboard, and pull the discs out with great force. I ended up putting them in a separate disc binder to prevent myself from ever having to take the discs out of the booklet again.
