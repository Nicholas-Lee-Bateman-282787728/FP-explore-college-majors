There are so many things which can make or break a train video such as; subject, video quality, entertainment value and of course price. This video does well with all of of them with the small exception of price.

The video content stays true to the title, I appreciate that very little time was spent on Southern Pacific and Union Pacific content.

Now that I have this DVD, I am considering purchasing the rest of the series, (even though the prices are a bit high).",1279497600,,573,4.447619047619048
