8267184,5,B0017T2LK0,I have loved this movie since I was a child. I've been looking for it for years!! When I saw it of course I bought it. It played well until the end. The last 20 minutes or so it was messed up. I got a hold of the seller and he replaced it no questions asked. Very good experience and I would definitely buy from him again,1515456000,,321,3.8059701492537314
8267185,5,B0017T2LK0,"Peter No Tail was a beloved family cartoon when our children were growing up. So thrilled to see it's available to purchase a DVD.
Can't wait to surprise each of them (in their 30's now) with it for Christmas.",1512259200,,209,4.384615384615385

8267187,5,B0017T2LK0,Peter No Tail was a favorite of our family's growing up and we were so happy when we could replace our vhs with a dvd.  The story is cute and educational and one that even as you grow up you still want to watch from time to time.,1317772800,,229,3.7708333333333335
8267188,5,B0017T2LK0,"This is an awesome movie!  I owned it on video disc as a child and never forgot it.  I almost paid $45 for it three years ago as a fair condition pre-owned VHS.  I'm so glad I waited.  Now my son gets to enjoy this movie too.  He never gets tired of it and shares it with all the other little kids he ends up around.

For some reason, in the second quarter of the movie, there is about three to four minutes where the volume goes very low. It doesn't ruin anything.  Just mildly annoying.

BUY THIS MOVIE!!!",1288310400,,507,4.05050505050505
