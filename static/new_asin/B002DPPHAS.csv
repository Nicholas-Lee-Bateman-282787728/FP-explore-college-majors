8365714,3,B002DPPHAS,"Nothing spectacular, this could have been a book on tape.  They just keep showing the same clips over and over again.  The facts are a bit shaky, don't count on this as your soul source for CIA ops.",1278806400,4,198,4.184210526315789
8365715,4,B002DPPHAS,"This DVD really gives very little information about the general workings of the CIA; instead it tells of the CIA involvement in Afghanistan in the hunt for  Osama Bin  Laden after 9/11 and in Pakistan searching for those involved in the 9/11 hijackings.

There are basically two shows;  `Hunt for Bin Laden' and `Pakistan Undercover`. The first deals with the CIA insertion into Afghanistan soon after 9/11 supporting units like the Delta Force element described in the book `The Horse Soldiers'. Emphasis is put on the CIA's use of Predator drone aircraft. Some of the actual agents describe what it was like to be on both missions.

It is ironic that even though this DVD is dated 2009 and 8 years have passed since 9/11, statements are made that give the impression Bin Laden will be captured before long.
The presentation seems to be fair in that it also gives  coverage to the CIA's controversial interrogation techniques. Basically a fair presentation of this specific mission of the CIA.",1258848000,11,994,4.886904761904762
