8428681,4,B004GEF8NU,"I was recently browsing the foreign library section of my local library and fell upon this DVD. Took a quick look at the jacket and the fact that is a recent release from Iran peaked my interest, so I took a chance on it.

""The Hunter"" (2010 release from Iran; 90 min.) brings the story of Ali, recently released from jail (for an unspecified crime) and now working the night shift as a security guard at a large factory. Becaause of his schedule, he doesn't see much of his wife and 7 yr. old daughter. To release stress he goes hunting in the country woods once in a while. Then, out of nowhere, tragedy strikes: in a scuffle between ""insurgents"" and the police, his wife gets killed in crossfire gone wrong. In addition there is no trace of his daughter. At this point we are not even half-way into the movie. Will the perpetrator(s) of this horrible act be caught? Will Ali be reunited with his daughter? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: lead actor-writer-director Rafi Pitts is all over this movie. I found it fascinating to see how events unfold in present-day Iran, I assume Tehran although of course I've never been there. I also assume that this movie had to be approved by the Iranian art/culture censors, which makes it even more interesting as the movie is not kind for/doesn't reflect well on the Iranian police force, or the Iran authorities in general. In the end, this movie is shockingly bleak in its outlook on life and you're not going to want to watch this ""to have a good time"", even though I was thoroughly entertained, actually transfixed, from start to finish. Yet I cannot rate the movie higher than 4 stars because of one or two plot holes in the second half which I was unable to grasp or explain unpon reflection. That aside, this is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare and if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, I would readily recommend ""The Hunter"".",1359331200,,2000,4.537396121883656
8428682,5,B004GEF8NU,"This is a movie directed and written acted all incredibly well. Ali has recently been released from prison and is now working as a night watchman in Tehran. This factory job now means that he is at least able to support his small family comprising his wife Sara and their daughter, Saba.

One day, Ali comes home from work to discover that Sara and Saba have disappeared. Realising that theres no point in waiting for them any more, Ali decides to go to the police. From there, ensues chaos. He is informed his wife was targeted in a shoot out however his daughter is still missing. He discovers his daughter deceased, and exacts his revenge by killing cops, and that is where the fun starts. I won't give the rest away but that is where the fun begins soon after he is caught.
