7950534,2,B00005QFEI,"Implied sex, lots of violence but little else. Good for maybe one viewing but don't expect wild, naked sex. It's not here.",1451520000,,122,4.590909090909091
7950535,2,B00005QFEI,"Amanda (Justine Priestley), abused as a child, now lives as an adorable  psychopathic killer who wants Richard (David DeWitt) as a full time lover. There are obstacles. Her doctor (John Alan Richards) who uses her as a sex object, Richard's wife (Karen Grosso) and Buzz (Chuck Williams). However, no problem. Amanda is planting a garden.

Amanda is cute, has a few good lines, but in a genre that is overcrowded, the film lacked a distinctive flair. Predictable.

Guide: No f-bombs, or nudity. Implied sex.",1419811200,,506,5.0

7950537,1,B00005QFEI,"I Think the ending of this movie would have been better if she would of gotten arrested,Instead. Not only that they had to bring up a sad scene from her childhood.",1235952000,,163,4.290322580645161
7950538,4,B00005QFEI,"This movie has great blues music, two beautiful women in love with the same guy.  Only problem, one of them is mentally unstable to the max!  Nice update on the FATAL ATTRACTION type picture.",1017014400,2,191,4.588235294117647
7950539,5,B00005QFEI,"Picked this up at Tower after being intrigued by box and story synopsis. If you like Fatal Attraction, Psycho type movies, this one definitely fits the bill. Personally, I like poetic justice in a movie and this one has it! Abusive types beware! If the same things happened to you that happen to the bad guys in this movie, you'd think twice I bet! Go Amanda!",1010102400,2,359,4.454545454545454
7950540,5,B00005QFEI,"Saw this film and was scared and excited all at once. Fell hook and sinker for the beautiful wife, played by Karen Grosso.  Can't wait to get my very own copy!",1007856000,6,159,4.129032258064516
