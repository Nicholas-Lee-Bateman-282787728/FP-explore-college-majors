1755237,5,B00006GF6C,"Once gain, I bought something so that the younger kids in my family could  see how we enjoyed Saturday morning cartoons.  Mighty Mouse used to come on at 10:30 every Saturday on CBS when I was 6. Now they say they know about us.  Anyway once again  I shared these with my sister and we had a great laugh; especially at the mini-operetta episodes starring Oil Can Harry.  I never could figure out whether he was a wolf or a cat. Wolf probably, since he was always after Pearl Pureheart The Mouse. I was amazed at how much detail I remembered about these old works. WOnderful! Wonderful. Slice of life.",1352332800,3,600,4.418181818181818
1755238,5,B00006GF6C,"I am very happy with the efficiency & timely manner in which I received the DVD, with it in perfect working order upon watching it. The cartoons bring back very good Childhood memories that I can pass on to my Children/Grandchildren, when Life was simple & ""no-tech"" ~ winddancer57",1329523200,,281,4.755102040816326
1755239,1,B00006GF6C,"The dvd box advertises that it contains three episodes with MIghty Mouse.  The exact words on the back of the slip case are ""Mighty Mouse is featured in 'Wolf Wolf,' 'Goofy Goofy Gander' and 'Bars and Stripes Forever' along with other cartoons. . .""  It contains one and only one Mighty Mouse cartoon 'Wolf Wolf.'  I do not object to the poor quality copy but others might find it unacceptable.  For some reason my dvd contains a second, even worse, copy of 'Wolf Wolf.'",1302652800,50,470,4.559523809523809
1755240,5,B00006GF6C,"Ahhh! The older cartoons.  As good as always. I bought this for a lady in a nursing home, it brought back a lot of memories to her and her sons.",1298764800,6,144,3.8
1755241,1,B00006GF6C,"I was surprised and disappointed by this product; someone saw fit to edit certain parts of it out; my memory is such I could clearly see that.  With this problem, together with the iffy print quality, I would definitely say that this was not worth its purchase price...",1226188800,26,269,4.604166666666667
1755242,1,B00006GF6C,"What you get is one Mighty Mouse cartoon and then a bunch of poor copies of other no name cartoons.  Granted, these others are all from the Fleisher factory and have a certain level of quality about them, but they are in rotten condition.  The Mighty Mouse cartoon really isn't any better.  You're wasting even the little bit of money you'd spend on this.  Oh, when will they ever come out with a comprehensive Mighty Mouse CD!!??  Mighty Mouse, where are you???",1124496000,27,462,4.585365853658536

1755292,5,B00006GF6C,"Into the kingdom of Bunkum and Bosh,
from the land Without Reason or Rhyme
rode Huggable Josh on his horse Ohmygosh
after a princess he left behind.

Dragons skedaddled when Josh hit the saddle
all those run-of-the-mill kind
not the green dragon, its tail was waggin'
for the princess Josh left behind.

In armor galore he bought at the store
Josh looked sharp as a pin
but in order to win, Josh needed a friend
a friend on whom he'd depend.

Who was that friend?
why, Mighty Mouse, of course
a friend of both mice and men

When the dust cleared away from the battle that day
Mighty Mouse, of course, was the winner
What a mouse! What a friend! A friend to the end!
so Josh took him to Denny's for dinner.
