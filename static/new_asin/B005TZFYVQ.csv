Using cutting-edge technology, National Geographic explores the human body from the inside out as never before. In six classic programs, we examine the inner-workings of the heart, the formation of skin, and what exactly happens when we push our bodies to extremes. Programs include How to Build a Beating Heart, Rare Anatomy: Bones, Rare Anatomy: Blood, Skin, Extraordinary Humans: Muscles, Extraordinary Humans: Skin.

This is a lie!  It does not contain the Rare Anatomy videos or the extraordinary Humans videos.  It is a 4 video set NOT a 6 video set.  This was the reason I bought the video and was very upset it did not contain these episodes.",1446595200,,668,4.990990990990991

8486745,4,B005TZFYVQ,"I thought this would help prep for exams, but as normal, it was a usual documentary as I should have expected from National Geographic. I got to say, they did a great job with the graphics and animation on this movie. Very great breakdowns. But it's unfortunate that it was useless for my courses that I was taking at the time.",1378857600,,327,4.377049180327869
8486746,1,B005TZFYVQ,"Yuk! No where does this clearly state it is mainly showing scientists doing weird, cruel and bizarre experiments on animals, like growing an ear on a mouse or taking out an animals heart and trying to reactivate it. If you like Frankenstein science, you'll love this, but it is NOT about the Human Body, but about scientists' torture chambers.",1373760000,2,343,4.830508474576271
8486747,4,B005TZFYVQ,"This is a 3 disc set (290 minutes total) which, especially if you are purchasing it by mail, you might not be getting the programs you presume. This is not a 3 disc general tour of the human body, but it has some programs that give some very specific information concerning it.
Disc 1 contains; How to build a beating heart. It is really about lab research into regenerative medicine, also including skin and research into why humans cannot regenerate like a salamander. It does show experiments on lab animals. It also has a section on human skin specifically.
Disc 2 has information on the womb - fertilization, conception, the growth and birth of the human from egg and sperm to a newborn child
Disc 3 is the disc that tells about the human body in general - the muscles, the workings of the internal systems, including Steven Tyler of Aerosmith's vocal cords. There is a short repeat of the reproductive system. This is a bit of an irritation to have repeated material, even though it is much shorter on the same disc set when it was already covered on another disc.

There is also the frustration of not having closed captions and a few slides in the extras of a photo gallery are almost useless unless you have a very large screen TV.
This is a good educational set, despite some of its annoyances.",1329696000,22,1304,4.548936170212766
