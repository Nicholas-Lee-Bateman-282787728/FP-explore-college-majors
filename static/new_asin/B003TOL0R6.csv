However, upon viewing the video, not only was it extremely short (I would say 30 minutes absolute tops), but it looked like it was produced off of a video camera from the 1980's in someone's house somewhere. I honestly don't mean this as an insult to the producer/director of this DVD, but I do feel that it could have been ALOT more professionally done, both in video quality, as well as the amount of information on the disease presented within. The DVD cost me nearly $30, and for that price, I guess I just expected a little bit more. (e.g. Recipes for gluten-free food, more detailed information on the tests one should get to determine the presence of gluten sensitivity, etc)",1341878400,,923,4.593939393939394
