796008,5,6304153791,"You can never go wrong with the X-Files. Most, if not all of the episodes are excellent in their storytelling, and in the past several sets, only the best of the best of each season have been chosen to be placed in this video  series. So it is no surprise, that six new episodes have been chosen to be  immortialized in bronze (so to speak), and all of them excellent and  sometimes downright scarry. [Keep 'em coming, Chris!]",926467200,,426,4.435897435897436
796009,4,6304153791,"These new releases contain key episodes in understanding the ""files.""  Terma and Tunguska will reveal many issues to help you better understand the ""truth.""  The next two, ""Paper  Hearts"" and ""Unruhe,"" are absolute masterpieces.  Both  episodes contain great dialogue between Mulder and Scully.  They also  reveal their love for one another. ""Home"" is a fan favorite.  Full of gorry scenes.  And ""Herronvolk"" is part two, to  ""Talitha Cumi,""  therfore you need to watch that episode as well.  There are great picks out of many episodes.  These tapes are worth buying.",925344000,,567,5.166666666666667
796010,5,6304153791,"The six episodes included in this wave (Herrenvolk, Home, Unruhe, Paper Hearts, Tunguska, and Terma) are very well done.  First of all, Vince  Gilligan did an excellent job writing Unruhe and Paper Hearts.  These  episodes keep your attention the whole time.  Tunguska & Terma probably  combine to make my favorite Myth Arc so far.  This may be mainly because it  involves one of my favorite characters, Alex Krycek.  Everyone gets a  chance of beating the &%*$ out of him too!  Well...  pretty much everybody.  Herrenvolk, the season premiere, was also a nice Part 2 of 2 that followed  Talitha Cumi.  It had more of the alien bounty hunter, the bees, Jeremiah  Smith, and more.  I did enjoy the controversial episode, Home, but I think  it was a mistake not to include one of the best episodes so far, Musings of  a Cigarette Smoking Man.  They may include this episode which talks about  the assassinations of many important men (JFK and MLK for example) by him  in Wave 8.  I kind of doubt that they will since that will break their  pattern.  So far each of the episodes on the different waves have been put  in order by episode # rather than air date.  That will take away and  chances of us being able to see it soon on video.  Waah!  Well, I will give  a 5 to all the X-Files waves since all of them are so well done.  Out of  the seven so far I may rate this as the 2nd best possibly to Wave 6.",925257600,,1403,4.334630350194552
796011,5,6304153791,"For anyone who loves the X-Files, the Pilot episode alone is worth the cost of the boxed set. Ice is another very good episode.  If you buy no other set, you must get this one.  It sets the tone for the rest of the  series.",924825600,,223,3.911111111111111

Amazon you really should give advance warning before people spend money on a membership for the specific purpose to watch a single show, only for it to be removed from Prime before i'm able to get half way through the series, seeing as season 10 and the movies were available for purchase, i would have most likely bought them after season 9.

I have been ill for the past few years and unable to literally due any physical activities. I'm usually involved in outdoor activities and now I'm be-ridden due having an Acute form of Ferritin Anemia as a result from a stomach gastric bypass 15 years ago. I am in mucho pain if involved in any physical activities as it results in extreme body pain. I am hoping that you add all of the previous showings of a new series called  ""Turn"".  I am a bit of a History Buff as I don't remember a great deal of it from school.  I will probably be laid up recovering from my condition as it was quite severe. I will want to get a couple of horses as soon as I am able to care for them myself and continue training horses and start instructing again.  And possibly take an online Veterinarian Assistant class. But until then I have lots of TV favorites to watch. I also am very much in to adult coloring too.  Actually, I  never stopped since I never stopped from when I was started as a  young child.

796965,4,6304153791,"A great season. The stories are compelling.

Would I have changed anything? No.

It is great to have a series express itself with such great tales. The entertainment industry would do well to remember that the story is what brings in an audience. Adverting may pay to produce and air a series. But, good television should not be dictated by the whims of marketing. Produce quality, grab the audience, and the advertising will want to support the project. My rant, 4/27/2016",1461715200,2,473,4.827160493827161

Watching these shows from my past make me realize just how terrific David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were in these roles.  David Duchovny was certainly sexy, funny and charming as Fox Mulder and Gillian Anderson was so perfectly real as Dana Scully.  Even Mitch Pileggi always delivering the spot-on-clenched-jaw lines.

The thing that keeps it from getting five stars is so simple.  Turn on some lights!  The entire series is so literally dark that at far too many times it is difficult to even make out the action that is taking place.  With true people, one of the very first reactions when entering a darkened room is to turn on a light.  Yet that NEVER happens in this series.  I understand that the series is about 'dark' activities but the constant darkness is excessive and really needs to be corrected.  I sure do hope that with the reboot there will be more lighting.",1457308800,,685,4.380952380952381

798452,4,6304153791,"So much better than the remake of the series. It is well made with many twists and turns and I really like most episodes as long as comdy routines are skipped in Sci Fi. If I wanted to see a really bad scifi comedy I would watch Red Dwarf, What a dud. But with most reasonably decent sci fi seasonals the writers reach a mental block and for lack of imagination they just try to include something really stupid to burn up extra minutes. All in all it is a good series  which I like.",1454544000,,482,4.073684210526316

798685,5,6304153791,"Ok, it's a little bit over the top, I know, but I'm going through all the seasons in preparation for the upcoming miniseries in January. You see, while the show was on the air, I didn't have the opportunity to watch it and had to catch up to the rest of the world through the DVDs. I had the same problem with MillenniuM.

I was in a small town in Germany for training (the closest major airport was Zurich) and had Season 3 to keep me tethered to home and happiness. It kept me going through those lonely times and helped me to keep going as the winter dragged on. When I went back after Christmas Holiday, I took Season 4 and that just added to the security I needed. The weird stories allowed me to escape the troubles with a new job in a strange land.

The people there were great to me and the company was a little bit strange but I missed my family so much and this season made my stay quite pleasant. Now, with Amazon, I just need a decent internet connection and I'm good to go.

I doubt anyone will read this with all the thousands of words laid down about this show. Just my contribution and my sincere appreciation for those that devoted so much to make the show possible. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.",1446940800,,1224,4.2

I purchased seasons 3, 4, 5, and 6 because I think they were the strongest, with the most diverse story content and fantastic guest stars. It's hard to ID the best episodes because there are so many but ""Jose Chung's From Outer Space"" with Charles Nelson Reilly (season 3) is certainly the funniest and ""Tithonus"" (Season 6) still gives me the creeps after four viewings. There are 20-22 episodes on each disk. I got them for about $15 bucks each. Given how much I will view them and lend them to friends, I feel like I got quite a bargain.",1433030400,,671,4.6

800543,5,6304153791,"Season 4 allows for several other reoccurring characters some air time.  The Alien Bounty Hunter (Brian Thompson) opens the season with another reoccurring character, Cigarette Smoking Man adding for some fun.  This episode, Mulder learns there are several clones of his sister in Alberta, Canada adding to his confusion about what happened to her.

Cigarette Smoking (or Cancer) Man played by William B. Davis, has an episode about halfway through the series entitled, ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"" (original air date, Nov 17, 96).  In it, Cancer Man thinks back on his own career.  This links him with Mulder's deceased father, Bill Mulder.

Season 4 is as good as Season 3.  The tone is set, the characters are comfortable in their roles and the writing, directing and especially lighting, are as good as it gets.",1421366400,,823,5.007352941176471

801190,5,6304153791,"Season 4 .....and the chills, thrills, suspense, and terror still work their magic completely!

As I have mentioned in my earlier reviews of previous seasons of ""The X-Files"", I had NEVER seen this show when it was airing on television, and only recently got another television set (I ""got rid"" of my previous set in 1993 and chose to live without the medium.....surprisingly for over 20 years---can you believe it?)!!!

This series has completely captivated me and has thoroughly tickled my ""suspense-fix"" and ""sci-fi-hunger"" that has not been satisfactorily been exercised since ""Outer Limits"", or ""Twilight Zone"" all those years ago!

I love this show. Fox and Dana....what a team! They play perfectly off each other! And the ""baddies"" are SO thoroughly evil, deceptive, and ""scary"" that one cannot help but be picked up in the plot of each episode and swiftly and completely carried along ""for the ride""!

Further, when they happen, the multi-episode shows raise the level of suspense and heart-pounding terror to heights that are unbelievable (at least in my estimation anyway). As I also have said in my previous reviews of earlier seasons, this is Top Notch television viewing....whether you are watching for the first time or as a repeat viewer......

Recommendations for a television show do not come more highly rated (from yours truly) and I heartily do urge you to watch or re-watch these wonderful suspense-terror-filled episodes.....there is nothing like them for stirring one's blood and imagination!

801569,2,6304153791,"Used to be a big fan (not a cult member though) of the dark and twisted, film noir style that defines the X-files series. Now I can hardly appreciate the story as I used to. Partly because of the incoherence in the story-telling and basically broken main story line (every time Mulder is close to expose the ""enterprise"", it's always a new target with the ""she/he/it is the one"" cliche, same bunch of green blood freaks covering up tracks faster than my garbage disposal, and at the end, life gets back to the unchanged ""monster of the week"" theme). I understand the necessity of suspension building and always appreciate a good conspiracy story, but sometimes the story just gets too long with no essential progression. But alas, my dissatisfaction could as well be simply due to my waning interest in the alien genre. Personally, I think Mass Effect tells a much more convincing story.",1400544000,,887,4.766233766233766

801746,5,6304153791,"This is a television series from the 90's and early 2000's by Chris Carter. The series is quite stimulating and movie quality entertainment. Chris Carter explores many controversial topics and turns them into an intriguing adventure by looking into the world of the unexplainable as being investigated by the FBI. The X-files is the label of such happenings and our two lead investigators have so much synergism and charisma between the two of them one feels as though they know them. While the series was on, I could not wait for the next one! Now that they are easy to view a number of different ways, I go back and forth and take another look over and over. What is interesting to note is that many of the ideas presented in the series that seemed far-fetched, yet fascinating,  are now being accepted as believable not only by government officials but present day culture. Panspermia is the thread that flows through the entire series, introducing us to the possibility of the origins of life coming from extraterrestrial existence and interestingly enough, is now accepted by many major religions and governments. Interesting huh?",1391472000,,1135,4.942408376963351
801837,3,6304153791,"I rated it as okay because of a technical problem that occurs throughout each episode it continuously/repeatedly skips without audio, and the characters mouths are moving and a faster speed without any audio or sound. Amazon needs to fix this since it occurs frequently and you have to replay that part of the episode to now what happened. The writing of the show is good, sometimes it can seem like an episode doesn't relate to the over arching plot development, obviously for the last episode of each season something happens which is explained early in the subsequent season. I came across this while on break and have been watching it ever since, a few of my favorite shows are supernatural therefore it is not a stretch to enough a show that features the paranormal and supernatural. This would be a good gift or purchase for someone who enjoys this show and is a fan. I will be watching the remaining seasons since it's free, with Amazon Prime.

801909,4,6304153791,"The problem is that the episodes are random and not in any order, the entire series is based on sub plots and stories. Although you get a few epsiodes sometimes with these ""phase wave"" box sets they skip around a lot, also they hand picked a few episodes out of the entire season.

They should have released box sets or just the entire series on vhs, or at least ten tapes not 3.
Either way you miught be better off getting the dvd season, but if you want to have some x-files tapes around for that rainy day then by all means its worth the bargain deal but trust me, you will be fristrated not being able to keep up, or get the rest of the series and stories that get you hooked to watch the next one because the episodes will skip a few months.

This is worth getting though I will say, it shows the pilot and some from the first season completely random.
For us vhr lovers , the convenience and syle, as well as affordability of vhs makes it worth while.

Lastly what really bothered me was that Chris Carter talks before the episode. They should have that AFTER...not before. They pretty much talk about and show the whole episode before you watch it, I hate that kind of thing and its like a selfish hollywood insider crew feature to analyze only.

802004,5,6304153791,"I was looking forward to this season as this is one of the 2 seasons (along with 5) I saw most of with my aunt (I know I said last time I saw all of this season with my her but actually I missed a couple of episodes, so I'll mark the ones I have fond memories of with an asterisk).  But while this was overall a very good season, it wasn't as good as season 3 or maybe even 2.  It was still better than season 1 though.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the DVD box.

*74.  Herrenvolk:  To save his dying mother, Mulder must protect the extraterrestrial healer, Jeremiah Smith, from a ruthless alien bounty hunter.  An excellent start to the season.  A+

*75. Home:  In a small, otherwise peaceful town, the agents investigate the death of an infant with disturbing birth defects, and the trail of clues leads to a clan of inbred, genetic mutants.  I'll never forget when my aunt & I saw this episode. A+

*76.  Teliko:  When several black men turn up dead - their bodies completely devoid of skin pigmentation, Mulder and Scully hunt down an African killer who must consume human hormones to survive.  A

*77. Unruhe:  To catch a twisted killer, Mulder and Scully attempt to decipher the clues he unwittingly leaves behind - psychic photographs revealing his darkest fantasies and fears. A+

78.  The Field Where I Died:  While investigating a religious cult, Mulder encounters a woman whom he may have known in a former life.  I'm probably the only one who will say this, but I thought this was the most boring X-Files episode ever.  I very nearly fell asleep while watching it.  F

*79.  Sanguinarium:  A series of murders at a prestigious hospital lead Mulder and Scully on the trail of a plastic surgeon who may be attempting to extend his own life through black magic.  Some good gory shocks, but that's all this episode is good for.  So many logic breaks and inconsistencies I never noticed as a kid.  D

*80.  Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man:  The secret history of Mulder and Scully's shadowy nemesis reveals the truth behind the assassination of JFK and the infamous UFO coverup of Area 51.  One of the most interesting episodes of the whole series. A+

81.  Tunguska:  When a deadly, vicious organism is discovered inside a strange rock, the agents race to determine the rock's origin.  Krycek is back?!  Despite that, this was still good.  B+

82.  Terma:  To gain tangible proof of the organism inside the rock is an alien entity, Mulder joins forces with the duplicitous Krycek and comes face to face with the startling depths of his own deception.  A decent end to a decent 2 parter.  B

*83.  Paper Hearts:  Seemingly prophetic dreams send Mulder on a search for undiscovered victims of a serial killer, only to discover that one of them may be his missing sister, Samantha.  The first two thirds are strong, but then it gets stupid.  B-

*84. El Mundo Gira:  After a series of paranormal deaths occur at a Mexican migrant camp, Mulder and Scully go on the trail of a mythical blood-sucking creature known as ""El Chupacabra.""  The ending always confused me a bit, but the rest of this episode was engaging.  A-

*85.  Leonard Betts:  When the body of a decapitated paramedic seemingly comes back to life, the agents begin to suspect the man may be an evolutionary freak capable of regeneration.  An excellent episode with one of the scariest monsters of the week.  A+

*86.  Never Again:  Feeling disillusioned with her life, Scully begins dating a dangerous stranger whose jealous tattoo compels him to murder the women he encounters.  Another great episode with a creepy villain.  A

*87.  Memento Mori:  Scully attempts to come to terms with her inoperable cancer, while Mulder and the Lone Gunmen break into a high-security research lab to find the cure that could save her life.  There's a reason this episode was chosen for a commentary; it's really good. A+

*88.  Kaddish:  While investigating a hate crime inside a Hasidic Jewish community, the agents uncover a murder that appears to have been committed by a dead man.  A-

*89.  Unrequited:  To stop the murders of military officials by an unseen assassin, Mulder and Scully must apprehend an embittered Vietnam vet who can make himself invisible to his victims.  The only flaw in this episode is that they never tell us how that guy learned to make himself invisible to people.  But the story's so good, you'll forgive that.  A

*90.  Tempus Fugit:  While investigating the unexplained crash of a commercial airliner, the agents' search for answers leads to the bottom of a desolate lake and a startling discovery.  A

*91.  Max:  Mulder and Scully set out to prove the passengers aboard the doomed airliner were deliberately sacrificed by the military in pursuit of stolen alien technology.  This is much better than the last 2 part story.  A

*92.  Synchrony:  When several research scientists are found frozen to death, Mulder and Scully begin to suspect the murders may have been committed by a time traveler from the future.  A great episode with a strong ending.  A

*93.  Small Potatoes:  The true birth father of small-town babies born with vestigial tails turns out to be a chameleon-like man capable of impersonating anyone-including Mulder.  This started off really good, but then it lost something towards the end when the villain impersonated Mulder for an extended period.  It wasn't horrible; kind of interesting in fact, but not what I would have done.  B+

*94.  Zero Sum:  Trapped in a deal to save Scully's life, Skinner helps the Cigarette Smoking Man destroy evidence in a fatal bee attack, only to discover he's been framed for murder.  A+

*95.  Elegy:  When ghostly images of female victims appear near murder scenes, Mulder and Scully conclude the apparitions may be harbingers of death for those who see them.  A

96.  Demons:  Covered in blood and suffering from amnesia, Mulder pieces together the events of the last few days, but the trail leads to a double murder that appears to have been committed with Mulder's own weapon.  This episode started off very interesting, but then got frustrating and just died at the end when I realized we'd never know what was going on.  C+

*97.  Gethsemene:  Mulder fights to prove that a discovery frozen in the mountains of Canada is irrefutable evidence of alien life, but his quest for the truth leads to only more lies...and an unthinkable conclusion.  The best season finale so far.  A+

Like I said, this is still highly recommended, it's just a bit of a step down from the previous season.  But I still look forward to the next 3 or 4 seasons.",1382486400,,6619,4.704385964912281

I have no idea where these feelings came from, or what exactly, caused them;  except of course, for such an apparently dangerous, seeming powerful man, he appears here as lonely, cut off, separate and apart.  Unable to be published for so many years;  then published in a way that has drastically changed what he painstakingly wrote, in an albeit cheap sort of extremist journalism (at best) ...

As I mentioned,  I am not certain exactly why I felt [almost] sympathy for this pathetic man, by the end of this episode;  a man who committed such heinous crimes, seemingly without a speck of remorse ...  But I did.
He is alone.  He is separate.  He does not love, or even like, his work.  He does it anyway.  That is just sad...

It was a huge hit for 9 years and really made alot of fringe ideas that few people paid attention to into hot topics and common knowledge. Few tv shows can make such a claim. But before this show few people discussed 'abductions' and the paranormal as a aspect of being real. It became topics that are much more accepted now. This was due in large part to the way this show was made. the acting is superb and the mulder character is so appealling that his earnestness carries through to the viewer. The show also has a understory that continues through 9 series and two feature films that did decent box office as well. The two leads here have excellent chemistry and it's not about sex it's about being good partners. gillian anderson really made her doctor character worth watching. The show is addictive and impelling. In fact the u.s. does have many secret bases and sites and that only adds to it all. Without a doubt few shows brought the outside into the mainstream like this classic show did. In fact it's one that critics of the day were quite found of , usually they deride sci fi shows but then this has a gritty sense of reality to it that was spot on and reflects the time it was made exactly. get this show.

Mulder and Scully are sent to investigate the murder of a baby with prolific birth defects in a small seemingly idyllic community. They find the Peacocks, a family of genetic, inbred mutant members. The pacing of the program is such that you start feeling fear early on as each mutant is revealed. Against the back drop of brutality, a 50's type song (sorry I don't know which one) plays.

802650,3,6304153791,"Let me start by saying that my rating is not based on the show's entertainment value which I consider very good. The rating I gave is based on my belief that the show failed to follow its original plan, so don't let my 3-star rating dissuade you from buying this collection if you're looking for an above-average sci-fi program. I didn't watch the X Files while it was being broadcast on TV, so, like others here, I am seeing it for the first time on DVD. Season One got off to a real bang with the very first episode and appeared to be headed in the same general direction as the series The Invaders, but the writers evidently ran out of space/alien material rather quickly and resorted to anything at hand. The Invaders never suffered such a plight and remained a thematically pure series from beginning to end. From an entertainment standpoint, X Files is good. Episodes in the 4th season tackle a wide variety of paranormal events and I have to disagree with anyone who claims the acting was anything less than great. It's just that in real life the big cover-up (perceived, at least) concerns aliens from outer space and not inbred mutants, cameras that take pictures of the future, etc. The show drifted from its intended path and the tie-in to the FBI became more questionable all the time. Had the show followed its design it would have featured weekly face-offs between Scully and Mulder and the FBI, with the two agents finding evidence of extraterrestrial activity and the agency stifling their efforts to investigate their findings. The writers might well have produced an even more entertaining show than the one we have. I won't describe episodes of the show as there are plenty of other reviewers who have done that, but I will mention a couple of things that are a trifle aggravating. When accessing the special features in the 4th season there is no way to return directly to the special features menu after viewing one of them ...you go to either the main menu or else the episode menu and from there have to navigate back to the special features. As much as I enjoy watching the extras it's a little more work than I would expect. Another small annoyance concerns the video. I use a Samsung DVD player with an HDMI output connected to a 1080p television. The player allows me to select what aspect ratio to use, so I choose 4x3 mode at the beginning of each episode. For some reason the DVDs occasionally force my player back to widescreen mode during the episodes and I have to reset it again. This anomally has occurred in all of the first four seasons of X Files, but not in any other TV series or movies that were filmed in 4x3. It isn't a huge issue, but I'm not a fan of horizontally stretched people. On the other hand, the transfer is excellent. So there you have it...a very good show! Great acting, excellent transfer of video. My complaints, other than the physical DVD problems, will probably not make sense nor even matter to many readers. This is, after all, a show worth watching.",1217635200,2,3014,4.583333333333333
802651,5,6304153791,"Even though the episode Avatar from season 3 was the first episode I watched on TV, it wasn't until this season that I started to get heavily into the show and it's continued ever since, barely missing a single episode. It's this continued success and type of stories they told that make it one of my favorite shows ever, if not my absolute favorite. While season 4 had a couple of uneven parts, it's still largely one of their best years.

Herrenvolk: A pretty good premiere as Mulder investigates a colony looking after bees while protecting Jeremiah Smith. 8.5/10
Home: A controversial, violent and genuinely unsettling episode of a bunch of deformed family members trying to conceive. 8.5/10
Teliko: Rather average episode of a man absorbing the pigmentation of African-Americans. 6/10
Unruhe: Incredibly creepy and the first episode that made me a fan of a killer who projects his thoughts into photographs. 9/10
The Field Where I Died: Great premise but bad execution as Mulder is hinted of sharing a past-life with a cult member. 7/10
Sanguinarium: Another decent episode of medical doctors being possessed for a ritual. 6.5/10
Musings of a Cigarette-Smoking Man: Excellent episode as we see the past of everyone's favorite chain smoker. Best chocolate monologue ever. 9/10
Tunguska: Intriguing mythology episode as a rock carrying the Black Oil is found and an old enemy resurfaces. 8.5/10

Terma: Part 2 as the agents try to locate the rock and further questions into the mythos. 8.5/10
Paper Hearts: Great episode as Mulder tries to deal with the fact Samantha may not have been abducted but kidnapped by John Lee Roche, a serial killer.
El Mundo Gira: Meh episode of a love story involving 2 brothers, a woman and a Mexican legend. 5.5/10
Leonard Betts: Disgusting and funny all at once as an EMT doctor shows signs of regenerative abilities. 8/10
Never Again: It's either weird or funny but an episode with a tattoo voiced by Jodie Foster who wants to kill is...neat. 7.5/10
Memento Mori: Along with One Breath as one of the best X-Files episodes ever as we discover Scully's medical condition and Mulder's search for an answer. 10/10
Kaddish: Back to meh status as the agents investigate a murdered Jew seemingly brought back from the dead. 6.5/10
Unrequited: Cool episode of a Vietnam vet capable of invisibility hunting down military officials. 8/10

Tempus Fugit: Part 1 of one of their best two-parters as Max Fenig from Season 1's ""Fallen Angel"" is killed during a plane crash with a possible UFO and military interference. 9.5/10
Max: Part 2 as the hunt for Max's ""proof"" continues. Intense crash sequence. 9.5/10
Synchrony: Iffy but good episode of a time traveller capable of fast-freezing a team of scientists.
Small Potatoes: Hilarious episode of a shape-shifter impregnanting women with tails. Some funny Mulder business. 9/10
Zero Sum: Good mythos episode as Skinner tries to cover up a crime that involved the bees introduced in Herrenvolk. 8/10
Elegy: Creepy episode of a mentally challenged patient and his connection to apparitions of victims just recently killed.
Demons: Intriguing episode of Mulder trying to uncover the circumstances behind Samantha's disappearance. 8.5/10
Gethsemane: Great finale as Scully seemingly betrays Mulder and his faith and life is rocked by a terrible truth. Big cliffhanger. 9/10

When I put the first disc of Season One into my DVD player, it started the ""loading"" process and gave me a disc error after about one minute.  Instead of cursing Fox (well, I did it later anyway) I turned the player off, leaving the disc inside.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my DVD player on and Viola!  I heard the X-Files theme and saw the menus (after the obligatory FBI copyright infringement warnings).

For those wondering, the DVD player in question above is a Philips Progressive Scan.  The same problem occurred on a newer Panasonic player.  No glitches materialized when I tried the discs on the Sony or AKAI players.  In all cases, I was eventually able to get to the episodes.  With the first two the screen sometimes showed up scrambled and the menus inaccessible.  On other occasions I was able to access a root menu similar to one you would see if you ""explore"" the DVD contents on a PC (Video_TS files, etc.), though the players would not load any content from these menus.  Speaking of PC viewing, I experienced no problems with any of the discs on my PC and all four programs my PC has to play DVDs functioned perfectly.

PLEASE DON'T READ INTO THIS TOO MUCH.  I don't work for Fox - I'm not trying to encourage sales of the more expensive sets.  This was just a personal experience I had, and it seemed to occur less frequently with Seasons 4 - 9.  My uneducated opinion: the equipment I have isn't top of the line, and maybe wasn't equipped to handle the way the content was compressed.  I was impressed that 4, sometimes 5 episodes were squeezed on one disc.  That's three - almost four hours of content.  I know - dual layer DVDs and blah, blah, blah.  But c'mon - even Lord of the Rings - Return of the King was issued on 2 discs!  (By the way, the content looked and sounded great.)

Another side note: Seasons 1 - 4 that I got were full frame, and 5 - 9 are widescreen.  At first I thought I had missed the option when purchasing these discs, but these are the only way I've found them at retail stores and online.  Nothing major; I just thought I was losing my mind at first.  (Which is still a possibility.)  I can't remember if they aired this way on television - I just noticed that the cinematography got revved up a bit starting with Season 5.  If this observation is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.

Okay.  If you have read this entire review give yourself a pat on the back, a cookie, I dunno - watch some old Doctor Who episodes or something.  A better price, better packaging, and better for you.  (They were giving out a carton of Morley's with the bigger sets, right?)  By the way - the 5 stars is based on my overall X-Files enjoyment.  Sure, there are episodes I can skip through.  But for me, it's good bang for the buck.  Enjoy!",1172361600,7,2967,4.381651376146789

802849,5,6304153791,"So for about $35 compared to the earlier set price of $90, I'm getting better packaging, and I won't get the extra disc of bonus materials that the sets come packaged with. Um, I think I'll go ahead and get the new reissues.

I got lucky and purchased the original first season box set for less than $40 right here on Amazon. The packaging for these more expensive sets are downright atrocious. It's one of those fold out thingies that are annoying to unfold completely when you just want to get to one disc. I felt like I was trying to take apart complicated origami everyttime I opened the set. I think if you open the whole thing up completely, it's about the length of a pool table.

Now with these new sets, the discs come in individual slipcases, minimizing wear and tear on the box itself and making it loads easier to get the specific disc that you want to watch. Also, the bonus stuff wasn't really that in depth and I can do without it. Considering that you're getting better packaging with these new reissues, it's almost like you're paying upwards of $50 just to get some behind the scenes info on a show that is even better with the less you know about it.

At any rate, I'd suggest going with these new sets, unless you absolutely have to have the extra disc of features. The transfers are top notch and best of all, you can relive all your favorite episodes of Mulder and Scully for a much more reasonable price.",1168732800,10,1427,4.3977272727272725
802850,5,6304153791,"Season 4 will always be known as the season when Scully got cancer. I forgot how depressing it was, or maybe it was just watching them back to back that made it worse. But the affection between Mulder and Scully is at an all time high, and ""Momento Mori"" shows that well. Of course, it's a classic and a favortie among fans for good reason. I've always wondered. . . . was Mulder's quest to help Scully over guilt or his love for her? I've always thought he may have felt guilt because the ""truth"" was supposed to be his personal quest.

Some of the stand alones were great. ""Home"" is pretty horrific, and ""Leonard Betts"" is also a scary one. Of course, there are the requisite bad ones like ""Teliko."" *yawn* A lot of people say ""The Field Where I Died"" is one of the worst, and I agree that the storyline is weak. But the acting by David Duchovny was the real story. I've never seen him better. ""Small Potatoes"" is one the best humor epidoes of the series. ""Never Again"" wasn't a great story, but I think it functioned more for Scully to question her reasons for staying with Mulder. For whatever reason, I've also always like ""Unruhe.""

As for the special features, it's ridiculous that they are three times as much as the regular disk set. It's only one more disk. I enjoyed the commentary tracks the most, but I'd say you need to be a pretty hardcore fan to pay this much money for the extras.",1168214400,,1397,4.3486590038314175
802851,5,6304153791,"Season 3 was definately the best of at least the first three seasons, and the fourth season follows in the shadow of this colossus.  Fortunately, Season 4 of The X-Files is still a great season of TV.  Starting right off with a continuing episode the storyline will pull you in as it did in the last season.  The mythology in this season is largly dedicated to the plot development concerning Scully's cancer, but deals with other things such as a short stint with Krycek and the return of Max Fenig from Season 1.  We also see the end of Agent Pendrell, and a special appearance by Darin Morgan, the emmy winning writer of ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"".  Season 4 also holds claim to one of the scariest, if not the scariest episode in the seried, Home: the only episode on the series to be banned from TV.  And as usual there are episodes that fall short (The Field Where I Died, Sanguinarium, Kaddish, etc.) but most of the episodes are excellent.  Season 4 features one of the most poignant character studies of the series: ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"".  Continuing in the footsteps of the Season 3 slim set there are a few commentaries, deleted scenes on assorted episodes, and speciel effects clips & international clips.

802852,5,6304153791,"Whereas Seasons 2 and 3 of The X-Files slim set are seriously deficient in picture quality, Season 4 takes a surprising turn. Owing to a much better film-to-video transfer, the images are impressive, particularly in exterior shots. Although grain is sometimes evident in indoor scenes, it isn't distracting, and jitter, commonplace in the previous seasons, is rare. Outdoor shots look the way they should in a high-quality production--clear, sharp, and vivid. Worth noting are the scenes in the episode ""Gethsemane"" wherein several scientists--and later in the show, Mulder and a forensic anthropologist--trek in the snowy St. Elias Mountains on a mission to retrieve an alien corpse encased in ice. Here the visuals are flawless. The men's colorful parkas and backpacks brilliantly contrast with the pristine snow; stray snowflakes are clearly noticeable on their hats and boots. Viewed on an HDTV, this is as crisp as full frame (1.33:1) gets. As for sound, it has been consistently good since the first season: clean, robust Dolby Digital 2.0.

Just be sure to inspect your discs after you open the package. It's evident that the studio has cut corners on all fronts with this slim-set edition, including the way the discs are handled at the manufacturing plant. If your brand-new DVDs look like rental discs--with smudges, scratches, and dirt--send them back.

802853,5,6304153791,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements with the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making it 25 episodes in total. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

X-Files: Season four follows in the steps of Season three, produces a virtually unstoppable series of great episodes, now that it has been firmly established as mainstream TV series viewing, finished with the `to be continued ending' of Mulder getting caught between a shape-shifter alien and a miracle-working alien battling it out, revealed that there is a possibility that the truth he is searching for has something to do with hegemony and the alien colonization of planet Earth. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is back along with Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). The mysterious Mr X (Steven Williams) is here, but also introduces us the new mystery deep throat type contact, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden). Back are `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund). The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville from ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"") is here. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) has a surprise. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) even turns up again even though he has been dead for over three seasons. The X-files season four goes for the formula of giving us the conclusion to the previous season's cliffhanger but immediately spins right back into the individual episodes about various supernatural things that is more like season one, however this only lasts for half the season and the remaining half has some of the best X-files the series has had to offer so far. There is more conspiracy however there is lots of revelation to suggest that the X-files is being misled to believe that Aliens exist. The only critic is that Scully's cancer story has been long drawn out... but Season five has a major revelation in store. Season four also boasts a lot of recognizable supporting actors you have seen in the movies. Season four of the X-Files is mostly about - alien colonization, inbreeding, mutant albinos, past lives, demonic surgery, the cigarette smoking man's past, serial killers, deadly cargo, El Chupacabra, Jewish mysticism, deadly tattoos, resurrection, dying, stealth assassins, UFO crashes, time travel, reproducing shape shifters, Skinner's crime, mind control and aliens in the ice.  Episodes ``Tempus Fugit' Unrequited', `Tunguska', `Synchrony' stand out the most but the best episode is Skinner's cover-up of crime in the episode `Zero Sum'.

However, despite most people saying this season's weakest X-Files is ""El Mundo Gira"" I must ask them to once again view the suckety suckfest that was ""The Field Where I Died"". If you judge that episode by performances, it is one of the better episodes. Yes, what great acting in the absolute dumbest idea for an episode of X-Files ever conceived. So Mulder was a Jewish woman during the holocaust and Scully was his (her?) dad. Wow. Kind of puts a weird spin on their romantic relationship towards the end of the show. Also, who would've known that we could prove that reincarnation is real by simply asking a hynotized person to describe their past lives? Gee, I wonder why revelations in this episode were never brought up again in the series.
Anyway, sarcasm towards that immensely ill-conceived episode aside, Season 4 is a must buy, with great stand-alones, great mythology episodes, and especially great character development.",1158537600,,1206,4.830917874396135

I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes. I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it. Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each. I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later. That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library. Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary. The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical. Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and mobid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project. Either way it's a piece of perfectly executed, mega budget, TV history and it shows in every episode.",1153440000,2,1436,4.7023809523809526

802940,5,6304153791,"""The X-Files"" continued on a roll with a stellar fourth season with the exception of one or two episodes. The show continued to be one of the best on TV even when it went into a sharp decline with season 7. ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"" remains one of the wittiest and funnest episodes of the show while ""Paper Hearts"" remains one of the most moving. In this episode a serial killer that Mulder put away prior to being assigned to the X files contacts him. He tells Mulder that there are more victims than have been found. He also tells Mulder that his sister wasn't abducted by aliens at all--this is a memory that Mulder fabricated to deal with what really happened. The killer took his sister and he'll reveal more about all of this if Mulder will agree to provide him with his momento book. It's a brilliant, tragic and ultimately moving episode that does everything that the series did best. It's also one of the finest hours of TV you'll ever see filled with suspense, powerful acting and imaginative direction that rivals a feature film. ""Leonard Betts"" managed to have the gross out factor of ""Home"" with more imagination. We literally have a ""Cancer Man"" in this episode. Betts is a paramedic. He's kiled in an accident but somehow his headless corpse manages to walk out of the morgue.  The worst episode has got to be the horrible ""The Field Where I Died""; good performances as usual and direction but surprisingly its badly written by Morgan and Wong. I take issue with ""El Mundo Gira"" being the worst episode of season four--at least it had a sense of humor to it. ""Small Potatoes"" remains a delight with writer Darin Morgan (who wrote ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" among other classic episodes)as a guy who just wants to have kids. Lots of them with tails. It's whimsical in the best sense. ""Momento Mori"" is another fine and powerful episode. Roy Thinnes (ironically cast as an alien when he was the ""Mulder"" on the Quinn Martin TV show ""The Invaders"") appears in a great story arc where Mulder finds his sister in an unexpected place. ""Max"" features the return of a character abducted by aliens from the first season. It's a fascinating episode that, again, does shows why at its peak this was THE BEST show on TV.

This will feature the exact same transfer as the previous set with deleted scenes, commentary and international clips included. What's missing is the booklet, deluxe packaging (some people hate it)and the final disc with all the featurettes, documentaries, etc. Some of the special features include commentary tracks by writer Frank Spotnitz on ""Momento Mori"" and by Vince Gilligan on ""Small Potatoes"". There are also deleted scenes throughout the set. Go to special features prior to watching the episode and select the deleted scene option to add it back into the episode. An X will appear in the corner alerting you to its appearence. Missing are the promotional spots, the documentary, the ""Behind-The-Truth"" spots from when the show was being aired on F/X and the DVD-ROM game ""Urbs Tertia"".

Many point to the show's move to Los Angeles as the reason the show lost creative steam--the reality is simpler--the show had reached it's peak by the sixth season with a slow gradual decline. While I enjoyed every season, season seven saw a marked drop in the quality of the show despite some appealing episodes.  I enjoyed every season of the show but the last three presented a ship without a rudder--the show seemed less directed and focused than before. Unlike some fans I liked when Robert Patrick came on board--his new character brought conflict and focus back to the show even if for a brief period. Patrick's character Dogget provided a nice foil to Anderson's Scully during these seasons as more of the main characters became ""believers"" in Mulder's ongoing crusade.",1139443200,38,3818,4.78030303030303
802941,5,6304153791,"What a difference a year makes!  A year ago I was ranting and raving that Twentieth Century Fox was bringing out the four-volume Mythology sets of THE X-FILES, something for which there was minimal demand, while what we really needed was an edition of the show that was actually affordable.  And here we have it!  Moreover, they aren't dawdling with the release dates.  In only a few months we will have all nine seasons out at prices that the average individual can afford.  Not just that, but far better packaging than in the original sets.

There are a host of opinions concerning when THE X-FILES was at its highpoint, but while I love all nine seasons, including the wildly reviled seventh and ninth seasons, I do think that from the second season until somewhere in the sixth the show was at its creative peak.  Because story lines spill over from one season to another, contrasting Season Four with either Three or Five doesn't really have much of a pay off.  Let's just say that here we see the show in the middle of its creative peak.

This season contains some of the show's most memorable moments, none more haunting than the opening image in ""Memento  Mori,"" as the camera seems to travel through a tunnel to look upon a woman in a hospital gown looking at an X-ray, only for us to discover that it is Scully looking at the evidence that she has a brain tumor.  Or the deeply disturbing ""Unruhe,"" which is truly nightmarish and demonstrated how scary THE X-FILES could be at its best, unlike most shows that even at their scariest are rather tame affairs.  The season also contains an episode that many think may have gone too far, the genuinely upsetting ""Home,"" in which Mulder and Scully discover a profoundly inbred family that keeps their limbless mother under a bed on a skid.  I will confess that while I have watched THE X-FILES all the way through three times, I have never been able to rewatch ""Home.""  The Fourth Season also has a host of outstanding Mythology episodes, beginning with ""Herrenvolk"" and continuing with ""Tunguska,"" ""Terma,"" ""Tempus Fugit,"" ""Max,"" and ""Gesthemene.""  There is also the famous episode ""Never Again,"" in which Jodie Foster provided the voice for a tattoo that drove a man to commit murder.  It is also an important episode for showing Scully's growing sense of self-doubt about what she is doing with her life.

of THE X-FILES broke into two unequal parts. The first two thirds tended to drop many of the ongoing development of the series story arc to focus instead on individual stand-alone episodes. Now, these were largely great episodes, but THE X-FILES was always at its best when it focused more on the longer story than on individual stories. There were some major plot developments in the first two-thirds of the season, however. Most importantly, we learn that there is a deep and shocking connection between Mulder's mother and Cancer Man aka The Smoking Man, to the extent that one even wonders if he an

Season Four does not have as many great comic episodes as Season Three, partly because Darin Morgan ceased writing for the show (or any show, with only minor exceptions, a situation I hope changes because the man is clearly one of the great writers in television).  Morgan does, however, appear as an actor in ""Small Potatoes,"" as a man capable of altering his shape at will, a skill he employs to change himself into a physical copy of the husbands or lovers of women he would like to sleep with, and in once instance as Luke Skywalker.  He very nearly achieves a moment of bliss with Scully by changing himself into Mulder, her willingness hinting at plot twists in future seasons.  Another great comic episode is a wonderful parody of FORREST GUMP, with the Cigarette Smoking Man (who my daughter and I like to call the HCSM, since he actually does not smoke, and uses herbal cigarettes onscreen).  The Smoking Man ending up as one of the driving forces of modern history, yet privately yearns more than anything to become a professional writer. In one of the most poignant moments in the entire run of the show, he manages to get a single short story published in what turns out to be a soft-core porn mag, and when he reads what they have done to his story, he agonizingly is forced to destroy the letter of resignation that he had planned to submit. It is a brilliant episode in part because he adds enormous complexity to all of his future appearances on the show.

There is no more somber plot line in THE X-FILES than the Scully cancer arc. The last third of the season is dominated by the sense that she is a dying woman, a fact the viewers are reminded of by her frequent nosebleeds. During the last third of the season the plot thickens considerably indeed. The year ends with a host of questions. Will Scully die? Did Mulder really die in the final episode? If not, why did Scully identify the corpse as Mulder's? What is the connection between the CSM and Mulder? Could he be Mulder's biological father? And will more develop out of that big tease moment in the episode where there Mulder-lookalike comes within an inch of kissing Scully? And was she as willing to kiss him as she appeared? In fact, although Mulder and Scully are have a great interpersonal chemistry and both are ridiculously gorgeous looking, the first four seasons are remarkable for the lack of romantic interest they express towards one another. In Season Three there are a couple of episodes where they express considerable jealousy towards others who get close to their partner (e.g., ""Bambi"" in the great cockroach episode from Season Three), but the show never lingers over this or expands this. Clearly Mulder and Scully love each other and are deeply committed to the welfare of the other, but there is little or no romantic element in this.

Season Four also illustrates some of the problems that plagued the show, in fact the only problems that plagued the show until the very end when it lost some of its creative energy. This was the tendency both to develop parallel plot lines that somewhat contradicted other plot lines and before a prior plotline had been fully developed. For instance, by the end of the season there was the clear implication that the X-Files were a gigantic scam on the part of nefarious forces within the industrial-military complex, that they had ""created"" Mulder. In fact, the first episode of Season Five would take this a step further, in a very funny episode in which the gents who would form The Lone Gunman pooled their resources for the first time and at the same time met Mulder, who at the time was not interested in the X-Files. The episode represents Mulder as being exposed to a powerful drug that would cause extreme paranoia and a tendency to conspiratorial thinking. This was all enormously funny, but it also undercut the show's own mythology. This lack of internal consistency was, in my opinion, the only thing that kept THE X-FILES from being as superb overall as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. While BUFFY got its mythology straightened out, THE X-FILES never did. Speculating further along these lines, one wonders if this illustrates the difference between Chris Carter and Joss Whedon. Carter tends to be more tactical as a creative talent, whereas Whedon is a strategist who thinks seasons ahead. The Carter versus Whedon factor is especially crucial when one considers that several key figures on THE X-FILES, including David Greenwalt, Howard Gordon, Tim Minear, and Jeffrey Bell, would serve as producers on ANGEL (and in the case of Minear, FIREFLY) as well. Or perhaps Greenwalt, Gordon, Minear, and Bell learned the mistake of not under girding a show with a consistent mythology.

Nonetheless, THE X-FILES managed a consistency despite the inconsistent mythology behind the episodes. This largely stems from two things: the absolutely magnificent writing on individual episodes and the astonishingly good cast. Few characters in the history of TV have held a show together as well as Mulder and Scully. BUFFY, to keep that parallel going, was always held together more by the writing than by the cast (though the cast was good also). David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (by the way, a natural blonde who is impossible to imagine without her red dye job) are not merely the glue of the show, but the nuts and bolts as well. I believe Anderson especially is outrageously underrated as an actress (though if everyone saw her in THE HOUSE OF MIRTH their minds might be changed). In episode after episode I marvel at how both of them bring so much more to their roles than can possibly be contained on the page).

But this is nitpicking.  By any standard this is one of the highpoints in the history of television.  And I am just grateful that I am now going to own these sets instead of being a frequent renter.",1137801600,29,8822,4.737116764514025

802943,5,6304153791,"Nominated for 12 Golden Globes and 61 Emmys, including 4 for Outstanding Drama Series, The X-Files is one of the world's most popular science-fiction drama shows. Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...

The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...

The X-Files (Season 4) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""Herrenvolk"" in which an alien bounty hunter is hot on the trail of Mulder and Jeremiah Smith. Jeremiah takes Mulder to a farm to hideout, a farm populated by identical girls who are clones of his sister (and all of them being of the same age when she was abducted). When the bounty hunter discovers them, he kills Jeremiah. Meanwhile, the Syndicate fears a traitor is within its ranks, and it will go to any lengths necessary to eliminate the problem... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Tunguska"" in which a rock with Martian origins threatens to have dangerous implications for humanity at large, and ""Synchrony"" in which Mulder suspects that a scientist is involved in a time travel expedition in order to stop his own creation from becoming reality...

802944,5,6304153791,"Season four was the ultimate highlight for me in the nine seasons.

If you buy no other season, then buy season four.

The ultimate all time best being the 17th episode of this season "" Tempus Fugit"", a movie quality episode that really defined the X-Files better than any other. It had it all. Wonderful sets, costumes, special effects, humour, drama, the excellent casting, terrific script, followed up with ep 18 "" Max"" a great two-parter that was only part mythology, it didn't really feature the syndicate as such.

It perfectly defined the essence of the alien abductions.

However "" Tempus Fugit"" was by no means all there was to season four. There was scarcely a bad episode.

The season starter "" Herronfolk"" continued the great cliffhanger from season three involving Jerrimiah Smith, that was partly co-written by David Duchovny.

It contained one of the best teasers to an episode, as it explored the link between the bees, the virus and the clones seen previously by Mulder and Scully in earlier episodes

"" Unruhe"" was a creepy episode about a serial mutilator, who had this incredible unknown gift of thought projection photography, This is an amazing thought provoking episode.

"" Tunguska"" and "" Terma"" were two great mythology episodes, which explored the black oil and it's testing.

"" Paper Hearts"" was another triumph and sheer highlight as Mulder and Scully investigate a serial murderer who still has victims ( young girls ) that are yet to be identified.

A very clever episode that is close to Mulder, as he has lost his sister to what he thought was alien abduction.

Somehow the killer in jail manages to convince Mulder that he was responsible for the death of Samantha. It makes for great viewing.

""Leonard Betts"" was another highly interesting ( if slightly gory ) episode of a hospital worker who feeds off cancers to stay alive. Don't eat your dinner while watching this one!

""Small Potatoes "" was another hoot, with the villian impersonating Mulder at the end of this one a ""must"" viewing!

The ones I didn't mention were also excellent, with perhaps "" El Mundo Gira "" the weakest in a great season.

As usual Cancer Man is superb in all his roles, The Lone Gunman make welcome appearances in several episodes. Skinner features prominantly for an  ( all too rare  ) episode in "" Zero Sum"" where he covers up the death of a woman for Cancer Man- another great episode.

As usual the box set comes with a few extras, and interviews etc that only add to the value.

The only sad note for this season was the death of Agent Pendra in "" Tempus Fugit""

I loved his flirting and interaction with Scully, it was hugely missed after this episode.

But that's the X-Files for you, you never know when your favourite character is going to get killed...

What more can I say, the box set of season four is awesome- you won't be disappointed.

Essential X-Files at it's pure best

802945,5,6304153791,"By it's fourth season the X-files had grown from a cult hit to a phenomenon, and the fourth season captures some of the greatest X-files of all time. Taking a truly darker direction, which becomes evident in the season opener Herrenvolk, part two of the dynamic Talitha Cumi. Although it doesn't live up to it's predeccesor, it introduces several plotlines that would be further explored. Early on in the season, the darker tone of the season is less evident, as we get traditional standalones that are just like the previous seasons. It isn't until the wonderful Paper Hearts that we begin to see the change, and the change is clarified in Memento Mori, where yes we discover Scully has cancer. This, put together with some other elements earlier in the season [I'm not going to spoil anything] season four is not like previous seasons. There are no self parody episodes, save for Musings of a Cigarette Smoking man, and nearly every episodes puts Mulder and Scully in a life/death situation. Of course, the seasons dark tone peaks in the finale Gethsemene. Anyone who has seen it knows what I mean. Now, on to some episodes I've selected that I think are highlights of the season. Caution: although in the following no really big twists are given away, if you don't want anything spoiled, then don't read ahead.

Herrenvolk: Mulder and Jeremiah escape the alien bounty hunter, Jeremiah leads Mulder to a mysterious farm in Canada where Mulder finds clones of his sister. Meanwhile, the syndicate is beginning to suspect an information leak.
Home: In this truly disturbing episode, Mulder and Scully discover a baby, deformed by inbreeding. X-Files at it's most bizarre.
Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man: the Lone Gunmen explain to Mulder and Scully the information surrounding CSM's past.
Tunguska: Mulder locates Krycek, and they soon leave for Russia to try and unearth the secrets of the black oil, but Krycek betrays him, and Mulder gets captured. Par
Paper Hearts: One of the best episodes. Mulder discovers the body of a young girl, which leads him back to a murderer he helped catch. Mulder begins to believe that this man knows the fate of his sister, and he begins losing his mind.
Memento Mori: Scully discovers she has cancer, which sends Mulder on a quest for the truth of Scully's cancer.
Tempes Fugit: When a plane carrying Max Fenig as a passenger mysteriously crashes, Mulder and Scully discover Max was transporting something, and they try to discover what Max was transporting.
Elegy: a woman dies, and the only person who can give insight as to what happened is a mentally retarded man.
Zero Sum: A woman is found dead with several bee stings on her. This puts Skinner back working for CSM.
Gethsemene: Scully exposes Mulder to the rest of the FBI as going off the deepend, and that he is obsessed with aliens. Just before this happened, Mulder believes to have found proof of extraterrestral life, but a startling truth revealed to Scully sends Mulder in a sharp decline, and has him questioning his own believes.

Season four provides more than enough shocking moments, and this coupled with some great standalones and dark tone make it one of if not the best season. Yes, I do think it's superior to season three. BELIEVE THE LIE",1109203200,3,3255,4.831541218637993
802946,5,6304153791,"To sum it up quickly, Season 4 makes the whole series a lot stronger.  This season is just as intense as Season 3, as dark as Season 2, as serious as Season 1 and on top of that, it takes the mythology of the series, Mulder's quest for the truth, a step further.  Things can't get any better than this.  I highly recommend this item!",1104278400,,333,4.092307692307692
803013,5,6304153791,"Dark, violent and probably the most serious of all 9 seasons of the X-Files.  One of the episodes that sticks out for me is ""Paper Hearts.""  For the first time we see what happened when Samantha, Mulder's sister, was abducted in a different light.  I won't give away any spoilers here.  The episodes in this season were just as intense as those in Season 3.  They're probably just as dark as those is Season 2.  If anything Season 4 is a wonderful contribution to the series, another reminder of why X-Files will be remembered as a classic TV series years down the line.  Buy Season 4.  You won't regret it.",1104278400,,607,4.454545454545454
803014,5,6304153791,"Season Four of THE X-FILES broke into two unequal parts.  The first two thirds tended to drop many of the ongoing development of the series story arc to focus instead on individual stand-alone episodes.  Now, these were largely great episodes, but THE X-FILES was always at its best when it focused more on the longer story than on individual stories.  There were some major plot developments in the first two-thirds of the season, however.  Most importantly, we learn that there is a deep and shocking connection between Mulder's mother and Cancer Man aka The Smoking Man, to the extent that one even wonders if he and Mulder have a connection far more intimate than either Mulder or the viewer might have suspected.  In fact, one of the best and most fascinating episodes in the first part of the season is a marvelous episode in which we learn a great deal about The Smoking Man's personal history, including the fact (well, fictional fact) that he was the trigger man on both the JFK and Martin Luther King Jr.  In fact, the episode ends up as an explicit parody of FORREST GUMP, with The Smoking Man ending up as one of the driving forces of modern history, yet privately he yearns more than anything to become a professional writer.  In one of the most poignant moments in the entire run of the show, he manages to get a single short story published in what turns out to be a soft-core porn mag, and when he reads what they have done to his story when it appears, he agonizingly he forced to destroy the letter of resignation that he had planned to submit.  It is a brilliant episode in part because he adds enormous complexity to all of his future appearances on the show.

While the first two-thirds of the season was extremely solid and marvelous, it may have fell just short of the brilliance achieved by the earlier seasons.  But at a precise point in the season, everything changes.  For several episodes leading up to the pivotal one, Scully had been cranky and more discernibly impatient with Mulder, though the cause for dissatisfaction seems to stem more from her unhappiness about her life in general than with him.  She was, to speak bluntly, in a rut.  But when Mulder, who is on vacation, calls her and asks that she go to Philadelphia to investigate an incident, she cuts loose a bit.  She gets drunk with a near stranger, has a semi-physical encounter with him, and gets a tattoo on her lower back.  Within two episodes, however, things get far more complex when she discovers that she discovers that she has a nasal mass that is cancerous.  The last third of the season is dominated by the sense that she is a dying woman, a fact the viewers are reminded of by her frequent nosebleeds.  During the last third of the season the plot thickens considerably indeed.  The season ends with a host of questions.  Will Scully die?  Did Mulder really die in the final episode?  If not, why did Scully identify the corpse as Mulder's?  What is the connection between the Smoking Man and Mulder?  Could he be Mulder's biological father?  And will more develop out of that big tease moment in the episode where a man who can change his appearance makes himself look like Mulder and comes within an inch of kissing Scully?  And was she as willing to kiss him as she appeared?  In fact, although Mulder and Scully are deeply attached to one another as colleagues and both are ridiculously gorgeous looking, the first four seasons are remarkable for the lack of romantic interest they express towards one another.  In Season Three there are a couple of episodes where they express considerable jealousy towards others who get close to their partner (e.g., ""Bambi"" in the great cockroach episode), but the show never lingers over this or expands this.  Clearly Mulder and Scully love each other and are deeply committed to the welfare of the other, but there is little or no romantic element in this.

Season Four also illustrates some of the problems that plagued the show, in fact the only problems that plagued the show until the very end when it lost some of its creative energy.  This was the tendency both to develop parallel plot lines that somewhat contradicted other plot lines and before a prior plot line had been fully developed..  For instance, by the end of the season there was the clear implication that the X-Files were a gigantic scam on the part of nefarious forces within the industrial-military complex, that they had ""created"" Mulder.  In fact, the first episode of Season Five would take this a step further, in a very funny episode in which the gents who would form The Lone Gunman pooled their resources for the first time and at the same time met Mulder, who at the time was not interested in the X-Files.  The episode represents Mulder as being exposed to a powerful drug that would cause extreme paranoia and a tendency to conspiratorial thinking.  This was all enormously funny, but it also undercut the show's own mythology.  This lack of internal consistency was, in my opinion, the only thing that kept THE X-FILES from being as superb overall as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  While BUFFY got its mythology straightened out, THE X-FILES never did.  Speculating further along these lines, one wonders if this illustrates the difference between Chris Carter and Joss Whedon.  Carter tends to be more tactical as a creative talent, whereas Whedon is a strategist who thinks seasons ahead.  The Carter versus Whedon factor is especially crucial when one considers that several key figures on THE X-FILES, including David Greenwalt, Tim Minear, and Jeffrey Bell, would serve as producers on ANGEL (and in the case of Minear, FIREFLY) as well.  Or perhaps Greenwalt, Minear, and Bell learned the mistake of not undergirding a show with a consistent mythology.

Nonetheless, THE X-FILES managed a consistency despite the inconsistent mythology behind the episodes.  This largely stems from two things:  the absolutely magnificent writing on individual episodes and the astonishingly good cast.  Few characters in the history of TV have held a show together as well as Mulder and Scully.  BUFFY, to keep that parallel going, was always held together more by the writing than by the cast (though the cast was good also).  David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (by the way, a natural blonde who is impossible to imagine without her red dye job) are not merely the glue of the show, but the nuts and bolts as well.  I believe Anderson especially is outrageously underrated as an actress (though if everyone saw her in THE HOUSE OF MIRTH their minds might be changed).  In episode after episode I marvel at how both of them bring so much more to their roles than can possibly be contained on the page).

I don't want to be misunderstood here.  I fully believe that THE X-FILES is one of the five best shows we have seen on TV.  My lament is that it wasn't one of the top one or two.  Getting the show's underlying mythology and undercutting it less would have gone a long ways towards achieving this.",1101859200,6,7022,4.723316912972085
803015,4,6304153791,"I love X-Files and this is a great season.  Each disc has at least one excellent episode.  I tend to like the stand-alone episodes that don't have much to do with conspiracies or aliens (though those are good too).
Disc One has two standout episodes.  The episode called ""Home"" is disturbing, violent, and disgusting.  Do not watch it if you don't like those things and certainly do not let your children or even your teenagers view it.  I wish I hadn't seen it.  On the otherhand, the last episode on that disc, ""Unruhe"" is captivating and very original, even if it's not the most well written episode I've seen.  Yes, it is slightly disturbing, like many X-files episodes are, but truly artistic and thought provoking.
Favorites from discs 2, 3, and 4: Sanguinarium, Paper Hearts, and Never Again.
Disc 5 is awesome; all good episodes!  My favorite of the season: Small Potatoes.
Disc 6: Ends the series nicely with a quartet of interesting stories.",1098057600,,951,4.7560975609756095
803016,5,6304153791,"This fourth season of THE X-FILES is actually a lot better than I had remembered. Some of the standalone episodes this season are admittedly rather lackluster compared to the best of the previous three seasons, but when the show was at its best during Season 4, it could be either quite powerful or, in the case of ""Small Potatoes"", quite funny.

First, the mytharcs. As far as the central mythology is concerned, things take a darker turn than before when Scully discovers she has an inoperable cancer midway through the season, which leads to the emotional highlight episode of the season, ""Memento Mori"". Scully's final speech, in which she resolves not to let the cancer beat her, is as moving as Mulder's tearful breakdown towards the end of Season 2's ""One Breath"".

Meanwhile, we have the two-part mytharcs, ""Tunguska""/""Terma"" and ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"". Of the two, the latter is, I think, slightly better: more intense, more gripping, more moving. But ""Tunguska""/""Terma"" is still a pretty good adventure tale, bringing Mulder and his hated enemy Krycek to Russia in search of the so-called ""black cancer"". That said, I always found the black oil piece of the X-FILES mythological puzzle to be kind of a silly one, and its extension here to include suggestions of a Cold War-type race to find a cure for the black oil disease is only slightly less laughable. At least ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"" deals with more believably sinister phenomena: a tragic airplane crash that may have been the result of our government shooting down a UFO and then trying to cover it up. Harrowing, immensely suspenseful stuff indeed.

The opening episode ""Herrenvolk""---a continuation of last season's ""Talitha Cumi""---introduces to the mythology the killer bees, and later, in ""Zero Sum"", we learn that the bees may be carrying smallpox, and that the Consortium may be using it to carry out tests on unsuspecting humans (what is being tested is never made clear). ""Zero Sum"" also plays with our ambivalent feelings toward the character of Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), whose loyalties have always been rather foggy: he seems to have great respect for Mulder and Scully, yet here still seems to interact with the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) on occasion for God-knows-what.

As I said before, the standalone episodes of this season are hit-or-miss. Some are simply dull, like ""Teliko"" and ""Unrequited""; others are much too heavy-handed about social issues, like ""El Mundo Gira"" and ""Kaddish""; and some others rise above its unpromising paranormal phenomena, like ""Never Again"", which involves a silly talking tattoo (voiced by Jodie Foster!) and yet turns into one of the more revealing X-FILES episodes regarding Dana Scully. There are still some magnificent standalones to be found in Season 4, though: the disturbing ""Home"" (so disturbing that it was banned from television for many years after its initial broadcast), ""Unruhe"", ""Paper Hearts"", ""Leonard Betts"", the wonderfully funny satire of ""Small Potatoes"" (with Vince Gilligan following skillfully in the footsteps of Darin Morgan, who guest stars in the episode), and ""Demons"". As ever, these standalone episodes rise above the rest in exploring the characters of Mulder and Scully in depth, and, in the case of Mulder in ""Demons"", bringing him to the edge of madness. That said, I didn't find ""The Field Where I Died"", in which Mulder discovers he may have had a past life, nearly as powerful as a lot of people said it was: it seemed way too sentimental and overblown to me. And ""Musings of a Cigarette-Smoking Man"", which purports to divulge some secrets about the reprehensible CSM, turns out to be a disappointment, making him more mysterious than ever by the end, even if we do feel a bit more sympathy for the way his life has turned out than before. Still, even by its fourth season, THE X-FILES still had a knack for turning in some good standalone mysteries, and these fourth-season episodes have the added distinction of being more personal than most.

And finally we come to the finale of Season 4, ""Gethsemane"". Though hardly a bad episode---it ended the season on a reasonably gripping note---I feel that it is with this episode that the mythology began to go off the rails and turn into the kind of overblown sci-fi soap opera that many people remember the X-FILES mythology to be. Were we really supposed to wholeheartedly believe that everything Mulder had seen in the previous seasons had ALL been a big engineered government lie? Everything??? Even that fearsome Alien Bounty Hunter spouting the toxic green blood---all calculated to fool Mulder into believing in the existence of alien life? I don't think I was the only X-FILES fan to find that a bit too incredible. It was by Season 5 that it became clear that Chris Carter was basically making the mythology up as he went along, and it led to a really big mess of loose ends by the show's final season, where the mythology had begun to feel overstretched and the standalone episodes were the only glories of the show left.

Still, that is a fault that would afflict later seasons. On its own, Season 4 is still a remarkable achievement, daring to go darker and deeper into the characters of Mulder and Scully more than any other season before it. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are still as wonderful as ever here, Anderson especially continuing to impress with her brand of intensity and strength. The standalone episodes are variable, but there are still some great mysteries to be found among this season's 24 episodes. This may not be THE X-FILES' best season, but it is perhaps the most emotional season of the show yet. Recommended.",1093737600,5,5687,4.981052631578947
803017,5,6304153791,"With season four of the series, the stand alone episodes and mythology episodes took a creative leap forward. While this isn't the best season, it still caught the show in peak form. Among the stand out episodes this season are""Paper Hearts"" and ""Memento Mori"" The first captures everything that worked well on ""The X-Files"". It's about a child serial killer who has more victims than he's admitted to killing. Mulder and Scully become involved when Mulder begins having dreams telling him where another victim is buried. The killer maniuplates Mulder using information he's learned about his sister's abduction and Mulder's guilt to arrange to get out of jail and lead them to one of his victims...Mulder's sister (or so he claims). It's an intense, emotionally powerful and scary episode all wrapped up into one.
The second ""Memento Mori"" focuses on how Scully deals with some very bad information about her health. The show focuses much more on the rich characterizations of the show. Also, the tongue in cheek episode ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"" suggests that the CSM was involved in everything from JFK's assassination to why the Bills kept losing the Superbowl.
Other episodes such as that involving Leonard Betts which leads to some bad news for Scully and even the convoluted mythology episodes all have resonance and power. We also meet Jeremiah Smith (the marvelous Roy Thinnes who was in one of my favorite shows from childhood ""The Invaders""--by the way Fox where is that one DVD?)who cures with the touch of a hand. Strangely, though, there's more than a handful of Jeremiah Smiths and they all work in the social security office gathering information. For what you ask? You'll have to watch the episodes to find out. The grand finale for season 4 was a suspenseful cliff hanger that threw everything you knew about the show into a torando of new information and misinformation. Mulder, Scully and the audience really didn't know which way was up at the end of ""Gethsemane"".
Picture quality on season four is actually better than on seasons one and two. I have to disagree with Mitch who wrote that season four is something of a let down. For me, it continued a string of outstanding seasons that became the foundation for one of the best shows on television. Chris Carter, Vince Gilligan, Frank Spotnitz, John Shiban and Howard Gordon all contributed great scripts during this season (frequently co-writing many of them). I'm not surprised to see that Spotnitz and Shiban had the same writing instructor at the AFI. It's clear these talented writer/producers learned a thing or two that helped focus their tremendous talent during this season.
The imperfections of season four are few and far between. There are a few episodes that just barely missed the boat in the quality department and those few that did only missed it by a beat or two. ""Home"" a controverisal episode that got Fox into hot water is a tad overrated and, for my money, one of the lesser episodes this season. It pushed the envelope but dramatically didn't have the pay off it could or should had. It's an example of an interesting concept that just doesn't gel as an episode.
The extras include two episodes with commentary, deleted scenes (which can be viewed as part of the episode if you go to the special features menu for that particularly episode), a documentar/featurette (depends on how you define it) on the series and a booklet with the titles (which is helpful for me since I can rarely remember the titles of these episodes),credits and a photo from the episode as well as a listing of the full episodes and their air date through season 7.
The show continued on with a string out strong seasons through season 6. Season 7 had a number of great episodes but the show was beginning to run out of steam and the uncertainty about Duchovny's part in the show clearly had an impact. Season 8 picked up steam again with a pair of fresh characters (Agent Dogget played by Robert Patrick does a great job being the skeptic to Scully's believer. Agent Reyes introduced mid-season acts as a nice counter balance to both). While season 9 didn't quite live up to the other seasons, it had a number of fine episodes in it as well. Luckily, Carter pulled the plug just at the right time for the show.
With ""The X-Files"" movie set for release in 2006 (Carter and his crew are in pre-production as of mid-2004), ther's bound to be renewed interest in the series. Hopefully, Carter can come up with a movie that can stand up to the best two or three part episodes that ran throughout the best seasons.",1089504000,,4589,4.766331658291457
803018,4,6304153791,"Up until recently, I never watched a single episode of the X-Files. However, now that the DVD sets have been reduced in price, I had the opportunity to start watching the show. After watching the first three seasons of The X-Files, I was hooked and I became a big fan of the show. I also noticed the growing trend, that each season seemed to be better than the last. Unfortunately, the fourth season seems to take a step back from the stellar third season. Don't get me wrong. The fourth season of The X-Files is still very good and filled with plenty of solid episodes. But the reason that I feel season four is slightly overrated, is because it is considered by many to be the best season of the entire show. It did not quite live up to season three, because the third season was great from start to finish.
The mythology episodes usually serve as the best episodes and really drive the show. However, the mythology of season four for the most part, turned out to be quite boring: ""Tunguska"", ""Terma"", ""Tempus Fugit"", and ""Max"". What really ended up saving the season overall, was top notch stand alone episodes like ""Home"", ""Small Potatoes"", ""Leonard Betts"", ""Paper Hearts"", ""Never Again"", ""Synchrony"", and ""Zero Sum"". There were four really good mythology episodes however. ""Memento Mori"" focused on Scully's cancer, ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"" in which we learn all about the CSM's past, ""Demons"" in which Mulder tries to learn more about what happened to his sister Samantha, and the season finale ""Gethsemane"" in which Mulder's beliefs are put into question.
Overall, this is definately a set worth owning for fans of the show. The season as a whole turned out to be very good, and the DVD set was great once again. The fourth season DVD set offers top notch picture and sound quality. You also get a documentary discussing season four as a whole, deleted scenes with commentary from series creator Chris Carter, commentary on ""Home"" and ""Small Potatoes"" from the writers of those particular episodes, and behind the truth spots from F/X.

Full of pivotal events such as when Mulder (David Duchovny) becomes infected with the Black Oil and Scully (Gillian Anderson) discovers she has cancer, Season 4 had storyline developments that would continue to echo throughout the series' entire run.  Standout episodes include Herrenvolk, Tunguska/Terma, Memento Mori, and Zero Sum; all of which expand the series' mythology, while stand alone episodes such as ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"", which features the Cancer Man (William B. Davis) being involved in a number of conspiracies, and ""Home"", an episode that actually was banned from being played on Fox due to it's surprising splatter like violence and story content which involves inbreeding.

803105,5,6304153791,"With each season through 1993-1998, the popularity and critical acclaim of The X-Files just continued to grow and grow. Season Three left fans absolutely awestruck, desperately anticipating the Season Four opener on October 4th 1996. Season Four continues to build in the mythology arc of the show, with a healthy balance of monster-of-the-week episodes that are more focused around the characters of the show rather than focusing on a certain character who appeared for the one episode - like Seasons One and Two. There are an amazing number of classic episodes in Season Four - all gripping, exciting and absorbing...

Season Four's opener, ""Herrenvolk,"" is undoubtedly an X-Files classic in which (to save his dying mother) Mulder must protect the extraterrestrial healer Jeremiah Smith from a ruthless alien bounty hunter. There are a lot of superb mythology episodes in Season Four, but ""Musings Of A Cigarette Smoking Man"" is not one. This episode offers a lot of information about CSM's earlier life, but I found the episode dull and rather boring to be frank. The two parter ""Tunguska""/""Terma"" is an excellent coupling of episodes. In the former, a deadly and vicious organism is discovered inside a strange rock. The agents race to determine the rock's origins and unexpectedly meet up with their old foe Alex Krycek. In the latter, Mulder joins forces with Krycek and comes face to face with the startling depths of his deception to gain tangible proof that the organism inside the rock is infact alien. In ""Memento Mori,"" Scully is confronted with the fact that she has inoperable cancer, while Mulder and the Lone Gunmen break into a high-security research laboratory to find a secret cure that could save her life.

""Tempus Fugit"" and ""Max"" is another excellent Season Four two-parter. In the former, while investigating into the unexplained crash of a commercial airliner, Mulder and Scully search for answers that lead to the bottom of a desolate lake and a startling discovery. In the latter, the agents set out to prove the passengers on the airliner were deliberately sacrificed by the military in the pursuit of stolen alien technology. ""Zero Sum"" was a rather disappointing episode in which Skinner helps the Cigarette-Smoking Man destroy evidence in a fatal bee attack while trapped in a deal to save Scully's life. Skinner's expectations, however, are misleading. ""Gethsemane"" is a superb season finale, in which Mulder fights to prove a discovery frozen in the mountains of Canada is irrefutable evidence of alien life, but his quest for the truth only leads to more lies...and an unthinkable (but very clever) conclusion.

The stand-alone episodes of Season Four are just as good as Season Three, but seem to have a greater depth and are more complex - which makes it harder to understand, but is rewarding in the sense of enjoyment once understood. They include ""Unruhe,"" ""Teliko,"" ""The Field Where I Died,"" ""Paper Hearts,"" ""El Mundo Gira,"" ""Kaddish,"" ""Unrequited,"" ""Synchrony,"" ""Elegy"" and ""Demons."" ""Home"" is undoubtedly the best stand-alone episode of Season Four, and definitely the most controversial episode in the show's history. In a small, otherwise peaceful town, the agents investigate the death of an infant with disturbing birth defects and the trail of clues leads to a clan of inbred, genetic mutants. The way the 'people' are so detached from any civilisation has - in a way - reverted them to savages (constant reminder of Lord Of The Flies) in which the only way they live their lives is by having children...with other family members. I tried to prepared myself before the episode, but nothing can with the shocking and grossly disturbing scenes contained within. ""Sanguinarium"" was another episode with mixed feelings from fans of the show. A series of murders at a prestigious hospital lead Mulder and Scully on the trail of a plastic surgeon who may be attempting to extend his own life through the art of black magic. A brilliant episode - with blood and gore aplenty!

In ""Never Again,"" Scully begins dating a dangerous stranger after feeling disillusioned with her life. However, the man's jealous tattoo compels him to murder the women he encounters. The episode itself is rather dull, but Jodie Foster offers an excellent voice-over as the tattoo lady! ""Leonard Betts"" is another classic episode (recently voted into the Top 10 of X-Files episodes in a recent poll). When the body of a decapitated paramedic seemingly comes back to life, the agents begin to suspect the man may be an evolutionary freak capable of regeneration. ""Small Potatoes"" is another brilliant episode in which the true birth father of small-town babies born with vestigial tails turns out to be a chameleon-like man capable of impersonating anyone - including Mulder. The episode has that rare dose of humour and horror, and an excellent cameo from Christine Cavanaugh (voice of Rugrats' Chuckie and Dexter's Laboratory's Dexter).

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

Along with Seasons Two, Three and Five of The X-Files, I regard Season Four as an absolute must-have for anyone interested in the show. With each season, the X-Files logically became better, and Season Four is no exception. The DVD has a range of extra features (too many to mention), which makes this essential for any fan of the show. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are again superb (when are they ever not?) as FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully respectively. To ignore Season Four of the X-Files would be unthinkable, so I strongly suggest you order it from Amazon now!",1043020800,4,5560,5.064410480349345
803106,5,6304153791,"Yes. I consider season 4 to be one of the best TXF seasons of all. There is a good balance of mythology episodes and monster-of-the-week-episodes. D.D. and G.A. did really wonderful acting throughout the season. The mythology episodes (Herrenvolk, Tunguska/Terma, Memento Mori, Tempus Fugit/Max, Zero Sum, Gethsemane), which are my personal favorites, did a great job in expanding the mythology. The coloniazation was explained a bit more and Black Cancer was introduced (it's different than Black Oil from season 3). Scully's cancer was found out in 'Leonard Betts'. Aside the great mythology episodes, season 4 gives also fabulous MOTW-episodes, the best being Home, Paper Hearts, Musings of CSM and hilarious Small Potatoes, which is easily one of the best episodes in the history of TXF. Leonard Betts and Demons are also good. But as every season of this GREAT series, there are also some 'baddies'. The worst is without a doubt El Mundo Gira, which has poor story and actors. It's the first episode of all which I would never watch again. The Field Where I Died and Teliko weren't also my favorites.
The technical quality of this DVD set is good. As said two times before, overall picture and sound quality has improved. Full-frame picture is almost crystal clear and Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround track is very good for TV-series. Extras in the set are also improved from the previous three sets, including the documentary, F/X-commercials, five short interviews with writers, special effects commentaries by Paul Rabwin, deleted scenes, TV-spots and international clips. As in season 3 set, season 4 set includes two commentary tracks. They are now for Memento Mori (Frank Spotnitz) and Small Potatoes (Vince Gilligan).
Final conclusion: Buy this set! Buy seasons 1 to 7 at least, after that TXF weren't the same (of course 6 and 7 were a bit worse than 1-5). The X-Files was,is and will be one of the best TV-series in history!",1041465600,9,1933,5.024922118380062
803107,5,6304153791,"Welcome to the fourth season of The X-Files, where this masterpiece of episodic television just keeps getting better and better.  This season also continues to show that as a television series, The X-Files is more than just a TV series, it's a genre.  This season is brimming with so many excellent episodes and a whole new and somewhat scary character arc for Scully.  We are treated to an even warmer relationship between Mulder and Scully.  It doesn't quite get as close as all of the loyal fans were hoping for just yet, despite Fox and Scully's first on screen kiss that was impromptu and edited out.  ""X"" is killed and Fox gets a new and quite beautiful ""insider"" to help him further his cause.
The mythology episodes:
""Herrenvolk"" is the wonderful season opener that gives us a few answers and even more questions about the government conspiracy.  ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man,"" This show, in my opinion, is one of the best with the CSM and is a ""must see"" for all X-Files fans.  ""Tunguska"" Agent Krycek is back and so are the Black Oil aliens.  ""Terma"" the conclusion to ""Tunguska"" which includes a trip to Russia by Mulder and Krycek where Mulder ends up having the Black Oil Aliens in himself for a while as part of an experiment stemming from the multi government conspiracy.  ""Memento Mori"" Scully confirms that she has cancer.  Mulder seeks to find a cure and AD Skinner makes the deal with the devil (CSM) to get her the cure.  This episode is what the X-Files are all about!  ""Tempus Fugit"" and ""Max"" a previously seen character, Max is killed in a plane crash.  Mulder believes that plane was frozen in place and aliens were abducting Max when the government shot down the UFO and the plane.  Another great X-Files mini movie!  ""Zero Sum"" CSM is back and so are the small pox carrying bees!  AD Skinner is in it up to his neck with the CSM as well.  ""Gethsemane"" The season finale and Fox is ""dead.""  I distinctly remember this being a long summer between this episode and the season five opener.
Stand alone episodes:
""Home"" is an odd episode that deals with incest.  Strangely enough, according the interviews on the last disk, this one had a very hard time making it past the network censors, huh!  ""Teliko"" is great episode about an African man who has no thyroid gland and kills others for theirs.  ""Unruhe"" is a well thought out episode about a man who kills people believing he's killing demons; when he does this, undeveloped photographs nearby portray strange visions.  ""The Field Where I Died"" I believe is one of the best episodes of the entire nine year run.  It's about a cult leader that is attempting to have all of his followers kill themselves and a woman in the cult who has multiple personalities that is tied to Fox through a previous life.
""Sanguinarium"" is about a doctor who has been taking patients lives for many years all for the purpose of extending his life.  ""Paper Hearts"" In this stunning episode Tom Noonan does a wonderful job of playing a convicted murderer, caught originally by Mulder.  The episode begins with Mulder having dreams about and confirming the locations of this murderers victims.  He also puts doubts into Mulder's head as to whether his sister was abducted by aliens or him.  ""El Mundo Gira"" is an odd and intentionally humorous episode about a poor illegal immigrant that somehow survives being in the vicinity of a comet strike and suddenly begins spreading a fungus that kills everybody but him and his brother.  ""Leonard Betts"" is mostly a stand alone except that this is the episode where Leonard Betts tells Scully that she has something he needs.  Mr. Betts is a strange sort that can re-grow any portion of his body that he might lose, to include his head.  Part of the reason he can do this is that he eats cancer cells, which coincidentally gives him the ability to see cancer in anybody.
""Never Again"" a great episode that includes a super star voice over by none other than Jodi Foster.  Dana Scully being frustrated with her life has a one night stand.  Unfortunately her pal also happens to be going a little whacky, killing women because Jodi Foster in the guise of his new tattoo is telling him to.  ""Kaddish"" is a touching episode about a Jewish woman whose husband is killed by bigots and she brings her husband back in the form of a golem.  ""Unrequited"" is about a Vietnam vet who was previously thought dead.  He apparently spent the twenty some odd years in a POW camp and has been freed.  He has a strange ability that allows him not to be seen and he's using that ability to kill everybody he felt was responsible for leaving him in Viet Nam.
""Synchrony"" is just plain great science fiction.  A man from the future has come back to kill certain people by injecting them with a chemical that freezes them solid.  ""Small Potatoes"" is clearly another one of the best.  A small town suddenly has several children being born with a tail.  We later find that the father is one man and he's essentially a shapeshifter.  This episode includes some extremely telling scenes between Scully and the fake Mulder.  ""Demons"" is an outstanding episode where Mulder wakes up in a strange hotel with blood on his clothing, no memory of how he got there and two rounds missing from his weapon.
Another fantastic season with some great extra features and good cover art on the box set!

803108,4,6304153791,"First, let me say, that I am a huge fan of the X-Files. I do love this season but I do tend to watch Seasons 1 - 3 sets more frequently. Pros: Small Potatoes (great funny David Duchovny episode. Nerdy guy who transforms into Mulder.), Home (scary, really scary episode. Banned from Fox after one showing. Inbreeding family bury their deformed child. Very violent but funny in ways that I should be embarrassed about.), Demons (Mulder receives unorthodox treatment into his memories regarding sister Samantha. For some reason I like seeing Mulder in a tortured state. Get to see Mulder naked.), mytharc Tempus Fugit/Max (I don't usually like mythology episodes, but I like the character of the constantly abducted Max. Hated seeing Agent Pendrell get shot though...he was sweet on Scully.), Unruhe (another scary episode. Serial killer can see demons inside people and tries to remove them by performing labotomies. Scully gets kidnapped...again), Paper Hearts (another Tortured! Mulder episode. Serial child molester/killer may have killed more...including Mulder's sister Samantha), and Elegy (people who are dying can see others who were just murdered. Scully sees one but does not tell Mulder until later...annoying Scully habit). Cons: Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man (too little of M & S), and Sanguinarium (gross episode about evil in a hospital specializing in plastic surgery. I had the beginnings of a migraine prior to the show, had a full blown migraine after seeing all the blood and the shrunken head.). Most overrated episodes: Memento Mori (I did not like the mytharc of Scully's cancer) and Never Again (not alot of Mulder. Dr. Scully picking up a stranger in a tattoo parlor in a bad neighborhood...right. Maybe she wanted to be a bad girl.  Did she sleep with him? Who knows.  Interesting, almost revealing conversation at the end between M & S.). There a very few episodes that I would not recommend watching. This season has very few comedic episodes though--very gloomy season (Scully's cancer began here). I think Anderson won an emmy in this season (Memento Mori).  Both lead actors won Golden Globes.  I would highly recommend Season 4.",1034380800,14,2163,5.101694915254237
803109,4,6304153791,"I own all the seasons available on DVD and I love X-Files.  Nonetheless this season loses a star because of the one episode I write to warn you to avoid.
""Home"" is far and away the worst X-Files Episode ever, and quite possibly the worst episode of any series in the 1990s.  Plenty of X-Files episode have some 'gross' scenes, it comes with the subject matter.  However, none match ""Home"" for sheer pointlessness.  If you like incest go rent the movie ""Lonestar"", which is otherwise a great film.  This episode, however, has no redeeming qualities.

Like season three, season four carries on the mythology with new, fresh ideas and classic story arcs. Plot points from previous seasons are finally dealt with here, the impact of the incidents shining through. This is the season where it all starts to change. Scully gets terminal cancer, and Mulder is now caught dead-center in the conspiracy he's been so avidly investigating. With drama soaring to new heights and humor still raising the bar, the season boasts some impressive episodes. Besides serving as a vehicle for the conspiracy, the stand-alone episodes this season are great, too. There's all sorts of bad elements this time around like the chupacabra, cancer-devouring madmen, golems, invisible men, and spirits. This season finds the characters really coming through in situations that they can't do anything about. Mulder and Scully begin to see their place in a growing cover-up to conceal the government's darkest secrets and they rely on each other to make it through and find the truth. With terrific story arcs like Scully's cancer, the identity of CSM, Mulder and Scully's part in the cover-up, and the whereabouts of Mulder's sister, this season marks the beginning of the best for this show.

803234,5,6304153791,"This is how this season develops... it starts with Herrenvolk: Mulder is trying to save his mother through an alien that has deserted the colonization project and is able to heal people simply by laying hands on them. The first act is excelent: the bounty hunter chases Mulder and the alien in a warehouse. What follows keeps getting better and better: the standalones reveal just how eclectic this series can be (from a historical/literary point of view of the recent american history, to a reincarnation and emotional tale). Then the black oil returns in the episodes Tunguska and Terma: Mulder goes to Russia with Krycek to investigate a deadly contagion brought to the US in a rock, meanwhile Scully has to protect his partner from a senate comission. These episodes turn out to be of vital importance at the end of seasons six and seven. But this is just episode ten of the season... and things just get better and better: Scully's cancer revelation in Leonard Betts and its development in Memento Mori marks what is, for me, the best moment of the series to date. And, finally, a fantastic cliffhanger in Gethsemane, where the possible relation between religion and the search of extraterrestrial life begins to be shown in the series. This cliffhanger opens one of the best trilogies of the show... very wisely concluded in season five's Redux/Redux II.
The best of this season include (pretty much every single episode): Home (the tale of a incestous and horribly desfigured family), Unruhe (a killer who projects his thoughts and nightmares into fotographic material), The field where I died (reincarnation treated in a very emotional episode), Musings of a cigarrette-smoking man (how much do CSM's literary fantasies reveal about himself, his background and his actions), Tunguska, Terma, Paper Hearts (Mulder faces his worst nightmare: what if Samantha was just kidnaped and murdered by a serial killer?), Leonard Betts (a man who is cancer and needs cancer to live... and at the end of the episode, he turns to Scully to get what he needs), Never Again (Come on! scully is a woman, she sometimes is intitled to need a man, but not a psycho), Memento Mori (simply the best X-Files episode), Kaddish (the golem brought to life by love but driven by hatred), Unrequited (a soldier left for dead in Vietnam has the ability to hide in a blind spot of human sight... and he is willing to use it to complete his revenge), Tempus Fugit/Max (an airplane accident, a UFO, military planes and conspiracies... a complex story that kills off one of my favorite characters of the series: poor, in-love-with-agent-Scully, agent Pendrell), Small Potatoes (another wonderful funny and light episode... one of the best episodes), Zero Sum (Skinner's faustean deal with the CSM makes him work against his own ethics and ends up helping the elder group ti cover up an experiment involving bees and smallpox virus), Elegy (Scully, a mentally challenged guy, a bunch of girls getting slashed... they are all linked by death: a poetic episode that really feels like an elegy), Demons (Mulder is willing to give everything up to the possibility of learning what really happened with Samantha... even his brain and sanity) and Gethsemane (an alien corpse... proof? or hoax to make Mulder believe and work, without knowing it, against the american people?).",1018569600,6,3344,4.983899821109123

803237,5,6304153791,"For three years, which spanned Seasons 3 through 5, ""The X-Files"" was Chris Carter's baby.  Seasons 1 and 2 were good in their own right, building up the show and setting the stage for what was to come.  Season 6 was still good, although the move to Los Angeles no doubt killed off some of ""The X-Files"" atmosphere.  Season 7 was a definite improvement, although episodes like ""Chimera"" and ""Fight Club"" were showing just how much the show was starting to age.  And Seasons 8 and 9 were okay; the former still had the ability to deliver the goods on occasion, while the latter has just been a disaster.
Season 4 was right smack in the middle of ""The X-Files"" sky-rocketing popularity.  Ground-breaking episodes seemingly popped up almost every week.  Just a few worth mentioning include: ""Tunguska""/""Terma""; ""Memento Mori""; and ""Gethsemane.""  But every season of ""The X-Files has had its share of bombs, and Season 4 is no exception: ""Sanguinarium""; ""El Mundo Gira""; and ""Synchrony.""
The DVD set is just awesome - you get all 24 episodes in as clear a picture as you will ever find.  Where I come from, the channel ""The X-Files"" airs on isn't exactly clear, so to watch these episodes again in all their picture-perfect glory was quite the shock.  There are seven disks in this set, the first six housing four episodes each.  The seventh disk hosts a set of extras, including interviews with the cast and crew, special FX spots and all the promotional spots you saw on FOX back during Season 4's run.
This set may be a little pricey, but it's well worth it, in my opinion.  Here's hoping that Seasons 1 though 8 make it to DVD and allow us to relive the memories of our favorite TV show all over again.
Don't even get me started on Season 9.  I've given it one too many chances, and even a die-hard fan like me doesn't want to remember what the show has become.  If you want classic Mulder and Scully, if you want ""The X-Files"" that delivers the goods, pick up the DVD sets for Seasons 1 through 8, especially Season 4.

803238,5,6304153791,"I can't think of another show in the history of television except the ""X Files"" that would induce me to shell out ($$$) (including tax) to have a collection of a single season's episodes.
There's no doubt that Chris Carter and his amazing show hit some kind of a stride with the incredible fourth season; A season that gave us the Peacock Brothers, Leonard Betts, Eddie Van Blundht (""it's Dutch or something""), John Lee Roche (the creepiest serial killer this side of Hannibal Lecter, as portrayed by Tom Noonan), the return of Max Fenig and Scully's cancer.
I've never been a fan of the show's mythology episodes...they seemed to be heavy handed and humorless; dragged down by pretentious narration; characters like the CSM, the Well Manicured Man and Alex Krycek overstayed their welcome before this season began and silly plot devices (shape shifters; killer bees; black oil etc) all gave the impression that Carter was making it up as he went along.
A couple of mythology episodes in season four, however, avoided all of the above trappings: ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"" was wild, hip and inventive (""the Oscars are next week...do you have any preferences?"") and the two parter: ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"" boasted  some of the best production values in the series history, not to mention Mark Snow's sensational score.
Undoubtedly, a handful of season four's stand alone episodes remain some of the series most memorable....Vince Gilligan's beautifully crafted scripts for ""Paper Hearts"" and ""Small Potatoes"" remain standouts; the wildly outrageous ""Leonard Betts""
had some great Mulder-Scully by play (""did I mention that Mr. Betts had no head!"") and some truly creepy special effects (who can forget Lenny giving birth to a new head in a cigar box sized storage bin)?
Were there some stiffs? Absolutely!
Even at ($$$), I refuse to sit through the truly awful ""El Mundo Gira"" and Mulder and Scully taking on the Golem??? (""Kaddish"")...give me a break!
(...)
A note about the package itself....
It's beautifully done...sound and picture quality are crystal clear...disc 7 contains a host of special material including a documentary ""The Secrets Behind Season Four"" (which could have been a little longer); deleted scenes; a group of FX Behind the Truth spots"" and a DVD-rom game.
I'll proabably lay out the jack for the Season Five collection (must have ""Bad Blood"" ""Killswitch"" and the underrated ""Folie A Deux"" on DVD...) but after that, forget it...the show 'jumped the shark' in season six with the move to L.A. and today it's merely a shell of its former self; except I'd love to share an egg cream with Annabeth Gish!",1008979200,6,2629,5.016018306636155
803239,5,6304153791,"When friends first turned me on to the DVD experience, it radically changed how I viewed movies. And when my wife first told me that the ""X-Files"" were going to DVD, my reaction was enthusiastic. What an incredible idea to put great television shows on DVD in season long box-sets.
I now own all 4 seasons currently released. And season 4 is the best yet! The box-set includes commentary on select episodes, special features and more. With each released box-set, the extras continue to get better.
Now with season 4, as the ""myth"" of the ""X-Files"" begins to surface, the show is becoming more like a long movie. An idea which my wife and I found when watching the first season of the ""Sopranos"" on DVD. DVD box-sets take a television season and turn it into a long play movie which enhances the viewing experience.
It's my hope that more production companies climb on board the concept of producing seasons of television shows on DVD. Series such as the new Fox show ""24"" will be a must have in our household.
If you've enjoyed the ""X-Files"" but haven't been able to keep up, I highly recommend getting into the DVD series. It's like having ""good tv"" available all the time.",1008806400,4,1174,4.595238095238095
803240,4,6304153791,"Season 4 of the X-Files, though still of high quality, marks the beginning of the decline.  I have said before that the third season was the best single season of the series.  The fourth season features bravura performances from Gillian Anderson as she first realizes and then deals with her cancer. However, the arc of the season before the cancer hits is far more uneven, particularly as concerns the ""conspiracy"" episodes.  While there are quality episodes here, the balance is slowly but subtly tipping.  The balance (...) slowly begins to shift away from quality in the following two seasons, and is finally complete by Season 7.  Overall, this season is leagues above the detritus that was Season 7.

Great video transfer and some nice touches on the bonus disk featuring some more deleted scenes.  One of the deleted scenes from Memento Mori is so heartbreaking to watch you wish it had never been removed. Overall a nice package although I have a sneaky suspision that about a year after the last season is released there will be a whole new collector's edition with even more alternate scenes, deleted scenes and interviews.  P.S. It would be really nice if the Truth Behind Season . . . documentaries were a little longer with more insight into the creation of the stories.

803325,5,6304153791,"I was just as pleased with the Season 4 Box Set as I was with the previous three... well, to be honest, since it's my favorite season, I was slightly more excited this time around.
FOX does a great job of packaging these box sets, in a sleekly designed case that follows the pattern of the first three. Altogether, the four sets make a nice little presentation on the shelf. <g> The accompanying booklet helpfully lists episodes from each season, and describes exactly what can be found on each disc.
The nicest aspect of this set, imho, is that all of the deleted scenes can be found on the last and seventh disc *as well as* interspersed throughout the episodes themselves. So if you are a junkie fan like me, you could tear open the package, plunk Disc 7 in the DVD player, and watch all those nifty deleated scenes at once.
I think it's great that X-Files fans are being offered such a nice collection of every single episode, season by season. The earlier VHS ""Waves"" were frustrating and left too many episodes out; similarly, ""The Best of Friends"" collections coming out on DVD are also selective. Why not release them all, the way FOX is doing with The X-Files?

Although you do get a good 20+ episodes for each box set, a set this pricey should have HOURS of extras/interviews/documentaries/etc. All of these sets are complacent - 'The Simpsons' Season 1 box set is a great example of how to do it right. After 3 previous tries, FOX still hasn't improved value-for-money. If you're a devoted fan, and if you have most of these wonderful episodes on tape, I advise you to abstain and make Fox WORK for your money.",1005696000,3,643,4.801801801801802

803328,5,6304153791,"In the fall of 1993, a TV show called ""The X-Files"" hit the airwaves.  It didn't exactly debut with a splash.  It's creator, Chris Carter, was new to the business; it's female lead, Gillian Anderson, was an unknown at the time; the only person half-recognizable in the show was the male lead, David Duchovny.
A show about aliens and government conspiracies?  Yeah, that'll be a big hit . . . And it was!
The first wave of videos in this box set are some of the best of Season 1.  The first video contains ""Pilot/Deep Throat"", the first two episodes of the series.  The second video contains ""Conduit/Ice"".  And the third video in the set contains ""Fallen Angel/Eve"".
Any new fan of the show who is looking for a little background into the show should give this set a viewing.  While buying the DVD sets would be the better deal (you get all the episodes from every season in the sets), for those that don't have DVD players videos are the only option.
It is interesting to note how far the series has come.  It is striking in the way it has changed over the years in look, feel and sound.  Anyone who doesn't know what Mulder and Scully looked like in those first few episodes will receive a pleasant surprise.  Back in the first season, it was not known whether the series would survive past its rookie year, so Chris Carter and his writers penned nothing but stand-alones for the first part.  While some of the Season 1 episodes are considered mythology, as they do have mythology-like elements in them, for the most part Season 1 is a collage of ""Monster of the Week"" episodes.  The chilling episode ""Ice"" is an example of this.
For those who don't have DVD players and would like to see how the series began, this first wave of videos is highly recommended.  The Truth is Out There - you just need to go out and buy it.",1005091200,13,1823,4.422155688622754

803330,5,6304153791,"While the fourth year of THE X FILES does not inhabit the Olympian heights of its immediate predecessor, the 1996-97 season is without question superb. It is also very likely the ""darkest"" season of THE X FILES. The prodigious, brooding intelligence of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully's continuing conflict of faith and purpose convey a tension culminating in a series of crises,  with dramatic ramifications that extend through all of the following seasons. The consistency of the writing, expansion of characterization ( Anderson and Duchovny in their most intensely committed acting ) , the complexity and interest of the ""mythology arc"", the ever greater feats of craftsmanship on the part of an amazing production team; all these aspects lead me to believe that the crucial 4th Season, along with the 3rd and 5th seasons are the real ""glory years"" of THE X FILES, the crme de la crme of the greatest television show in history.
The season opener ""Herrenvolk"" doesn't quite keep up the level of quality exhibited in the previous years cliff hanger ( ""Talitha Cumi"" ) but does effectively link to the conspiracy storyline which would shortly be taken up in the first series of myth-arc episodes. According to a tradition that had been established in the two prior years, the 4th Season contained a couple of these two-part scripts, airing in the early and late season respectively. This well planned bit of strategy helped balance the ""stand alone"" episodes while maintaining a forward momentum leading to the cliff-hanger at the very end.
""Tunguska""/""Terma"" are action oriented episodes, featuring both the return of the ever-treacherous Alex Krycek and Mulder's chilling imprisonment in a Siberian gulag. The late season two parter,  ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"", skillfully reintroduces a beloved and eccentric character not seen since Season 1.  The prevailing mood is one of darkness, where Mulder and Scully face yet another series of losses.  A technical note: the re-creation of the plane crash is mind-bogglingly good, even in a show where miracles of production are common.  The overhead, wide angle cinematography conveys a grim, documentary style realism that is very disturbing.
The ""stand alone"" episodes, while not as brilliantly quirky as those of the 3rd Season, are of a high quality and originality. In the infamous ""Home"" humor is mixed with gruesome violence in a manner that makes one understand why the television censors were, to put it mildly, ""concerned"". A lesser (though entertaining) bloodletting episode in the same vein, ""Sanguinarium"", is the 4th season representative of what could be termed ""Exorcist Files"" (there are numerous scripts of this type throughout the history of the show ).
""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"" is a take, somewhat whimsical, on the Cigarette Smoking Man's background. In an interview Chris Carter gave in response to this episode, he made it clear that this story was more a type of fantasy than the true history behind the mysterious arch villain played by William B. Davis.
""The Field Where I Died"" is a mixed bag; a very good performance by David Duchovny but the ""reincarnation romance"" script strained after a dramatic effect that didn't seem to fit his character.
""Paper Hearts"", written by Vince Gilligan, is rightly acclaimed for its interweaving several strands of plot: Mulder's quest for his sister ( and her then unknown fate ) and yet another unstinting look at human evil ( great guest actor ). Mark Snow's score is particularly memorable.
Mid season is the literal and figurative ""center"" of Season Four, the point where the dramatic action really heats up. The folks at Chris Carter's ""1013"" productions arranged the airing of several mid season episodes with a mind to showcasing Gillian Anderson's superb acting ability. ""Leonard Betts"" (4X14) was, as the episode number indicates, the 14th episode put in the can, but it was aired before ""Never Again"" (4X13) in order to build up the suspense regarding Dana Scully's physical and psychological state, reaching a climax in ""Momento Mori"" (4X15).  Following the latter episode, a distinct and pervasive sense of gloom fell over the shows imaginative landscape, a melancholia reflected not only in Scully's ongoing ""condition"" but also in the subject matter unique to the episodes subsequently aired:  ""Kaddish"", ""Unrequited"" and the two-parter previously mentioned  ( ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"" ).
In the myth arc episode titled ""Zero Sum"", F.B.I. Assistant Director Walter Skinner is forced into a nefarious scheme due to the Faustian bargain he made in ""Momento Mori"". Mitch Pileggi turns in a customarily fine performance that adds another layer of substance to Skinner's character and at the same time represents the latest link in the ""conspiracy chain"" ( which arguably unraveled when the show moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles for its 6th Season ).
Writer John Shiban is the unfortunate creator of Season 4's worst episode ( ""El Mundo Gira"" ) but to his credit the episode doesn't take itself too seriously. As with Vince Gilligan's clever, lighthearted comic episode ""Small Potatoes"" ( featuring former X FILES writer Darin Morgan in an onscreen role ), Shiban's script lends an air of levity that is welcome relief in a predominantly dark year. In fact, both episodes seem almost out of place when considering the season in its gloomy totality, which reaches its zenith in the tragedy of the cliffhanger, ""Gesthemane"".
In closing, it is necessary to point out yet again what has been oft said; that the success of THE X FILES is shared amongst many talented and dedicated individuals, most applying their craft off screen. Mark Snow's custom tailored music is simply gold: consistently excellent, moving work ( with the occasional sly quote from classical composers woven in ). The directors frame their shots in very interesting ways. The lighting, sets and camera work are redolent of high quality film making ( television standards are left in the dust ). The writers ( truly the core of the show ), most especially in Seasons 3 thru 5, created layered, complex scripts that challenged the considerable talents of Duchovny and Anderson ( not to mention the numerous excellent guest actors chosen by superb casting agents ). Finally, regardless of what some embittered fans may opine, Chris Carter deserves credit for continually guiding his creation through the years. His labor of love was especially evident during the ""glory years"" of 1995-98, of which Season Four is an inspired testament.",1003622400,131,6522,5.14622641509434

This season also features a refreshing and I think unique number of conspiracy stand-alone episodes, (eg 'Memento Mori' 'Zero Sum' 'Demons' and 'Musings of a CSM'), which is perhaps what made '4' [pun intended] such a great season, and made '97 such a great year.",1000339200,4,905,5.080536912751678

Unfounded worries. They did not zoom into the 4:3 scale to get the 16:9 widescreen ratio. They used the original cuts with the tv safeties on the side (extra bits the used to record). Essentially they were 16:10. They only took a tiny bit off the top and bottom to create the 16:9 ratio. It did not lose much on top or bottom to make a difference. The transfer is one of the best I have ever seen. This show is breathtaking on bluray. I am glad I held out for so long. I cannot wait to binge this on the big screen.
