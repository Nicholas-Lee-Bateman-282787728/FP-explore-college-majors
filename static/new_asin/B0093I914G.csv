8535204,5,B0093I914G,"Many may not care for the 2008 Batman: Gotham Knight, but I enjoyed it. It may not be the greatest DC animated film out there, but hell, it's still entertaining. Justice League: The New Frontier on the other hand it a GREAT animated film. I love when superhero films ties into history (reasons I also like Watchmen/X-Men: First Class). Give it a watch, you'll love it! Definitely a 5/5 for me.",1455926400,,393,4.549295774647887

8535207,5,B0093I914G,This is a nice purchase to have on Blu Ray.  Avid fans like me already have eash film on blu ray.  This cant to anything but good to have it as a double feature to showcase the talent behind these films.  I bought this for my brother who loves these animes also and didn't already own.  He loves it and how can you not!? Its a win win!  2 Great films though I like having them separate because they are strong enough to merit that.  These are the seminal to the DC ANIME LINE!,1422576000,,476,4.01063829787234

8535209,5,B0093I914G,"Just to clarify for anyone wondering--this comes with both full-featured Blu-Rays. These are the exact discs you'd receive in their respective releases, just in a discounted double feature. For the movies themselves, I'd recommend reading their reviews pages. I wholeheartedly recommend both features, especially New Frontier, and the special features are great.",1383782400,4,362,5.980769230769231
8535210,4,B0093I914G,"Hi possible Justice Leaguers! This is my first review on Amazon and I'm sad it's a negative one. I really hope to warn anybody who is looking at this as the cheap alternative for buying the Justice League. Honestly, I've never seen more than 2 or 3 episodes of the show. When I saw the first season (picture for product) I was excited at the opportunity to check it out on Blu-ray at a bargain deal. I will admit that I didn't actually scan the product page before purchasing. When I received it today (prompt shipping by Amazon, as usual) I realized that the product is not actually the Justice League Season One but a 2-pack containing Batman: Gotham Knight and Justice League: The New Frontier. No harm done, I plan on returning it soon. Just wanted to warn my fellow Amazon buyers. Hopefully Amazon changes the product picture so nobody else makes my silly mistake. Have a great day!

EDIT: Amazon has fixed the product picture. Never seen New Frontier but Gotham Knight is pretty nifty.",1362355200,13,991,4.598870056497175
