8633796,5,B00HNJOTLM,"British narrator Christopher Glyn's emotive reading captures the beauty and power of God's Word and makes the King James English clear and easy to understand. There is beautiful background music on some of the books and chapters. I usually load one or two books onto my MP3 player and listen to it while I have my daily run. On this one DVD-ROM is 28 hours of audio. 441 audio files and includes Psalms & Proverbs also. They have audio samples of their recording on their Treasures365 website. I'm very pleased with this version, I also got the Old Testament that they sell on Amazon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B00HNJOUBQ/dp/B00HNJOUBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B00HNJOUBQ</a>",1389744000,,726,5.794392523364486
