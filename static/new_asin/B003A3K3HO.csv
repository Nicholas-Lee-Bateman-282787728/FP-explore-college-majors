8392796,5,B003A3K3HO,"Better late than never!!! For watching it and for their comeback!!!
It is a totally renovated Spandau Ballet, same great people like Tony and Gary, but new sound, a really good one. They performed in a superb way without the pressure of getting to #1 in the charts, just for the joy of doing it and entertain the audience and themselves.

I recommend it to all, not only SB fans they won't be disappointed!!!!",1374537600,2,409,4.527027027027027
8392797,5,B003A3K3HO,"The songs are great and the performance is excellent. I wish this would come out in a Blu-ray format. And I hope this is not the last of the Spandau Ballet. I think they're one of the best groups to come out of the 80's. Their songs are definitely better and with more lasting quality and variety than those of Duran Duran. If you like Spandau Ballet and even if you don't, you should give this a try.",1369785600,,401,4.153846153846154
8392798,5,B003A3K3HO,It is so good to see them together after all these years and patch up their differences. Excellent as ever. The only thing better is if I was there at the actual concert.,1363824000,,170,4.181818181818182
8392799,5,B003A3K3HO,"I imagined that after nearly 20 years apart this band would have a few stumbles, a few missed notes, a few forgotten words. But SB really shines in this CD. And it's a surprise. Perhaps the biggest change (at least that I noticed) was the quality of Tony Hadley's voice: it's deeper, richer and more mature. That's what a fight over royalties and almost losing your house will do to you. The other surprise is what wonderful musicians these guys are, particularly Steve Norman... John Keeble, too, does more in this concert than I've given him credit for.",1362441600,2,555,4.673469387755102
8392800,5,B003A3K3HO,I have watched this over and over already! They are the best they have ever been. Tony's voice is so strong and great range. Just wish they were still playing together.,1361664000,,168,4.451612903225806
8392801,5,B003A3K3HO,"Thirty years after their first recordings and almost twenty after they disbanded, british prime new romantics came back with a new CD (containing re-recording of some of their most popular tunes plus a couple of new songs) and a tour in 2009. Recorded live at the famous O2 Arena in London, this DVD caught the band in an inspired night: it's hard to believe they were away for so long, since their perfomance was so hot, tight and, at the same time, so relaxed it seemed they were never apart. They surely didn't lose any of their musicanship. And none of their elegance either, for the matter.

Strangely for a band that had so many great videos, the only live performance available officially thus far was that of their last tour before they broke up in 1990. However, that video (reissue under several titles and covers, but they are all the same, so beware!) is marred by the inclusion of far too many songs from their last (and the weakest) album, Heart Like A Sky. Fortunatly this time they gave what the people wanted: a real fantastic selection of their best songs, all performed with gusto by the band.

It is ok that they are not as yound as they used to be, but boy, what stamina they have! Steve Norman, specially, seems to be particulary fired up, going to alto, tenor and soprano saxophones to guitar, percussion and backing vocals with a teenage energy. Vocalist Tony Hadley may have gained a few pounds over the years, and his voice may not be as sharp as it used to, but he still sings them in the same key as they were originally recorded. In fact I was surprised how well he handles such demanding material. He is surely one of the best and most underated singers of his generation. The rest of the band is also in fine form, all smiles and playing flawlessly.

Besides teh obvious hits and other well known CD tracks, there was room enough for them to introduce a new song, called Once Again, that was well received by the audience. And I should point out that the public was a show apart, always cheering, dancing, clapping and singing. It is obvious that the band was quite moved by the emotional reaction of the audience. Sound, lights and video quality are simply perfect, helped by a very good edition and the tasteful and efficient stage props (again way superior to their previous video of 1990). My only gripe is the fact that a great song like Cross The Lines is missing here (it seems it was played on this concert, but somehow wasn't included on the video), but otherwise the fans won't have a reason to complain: they play material from all their phases, so there is something for everyone. Highlights? For me there were many, like the blistering version of Man In Chains, the sing along part of True and the poignant version of She Loved Like Diamond.

Overall a great DVD that does justice to this fine band from the 80's that never got the recognition, fame or the fortune they deserved like their rivals of Duran Duran and Culture Club.",1340841600,2,2973,4.5307262569832405
