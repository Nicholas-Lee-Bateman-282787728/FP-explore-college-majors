8720310,1,B00ZGWGRVI,"This version is a compressed version. Picture quality could be better. A few parts freezes. Will wait for a better version.  Also, being a collector, this version was plainly packed in plastic sleeves. I prefer the digipak, booklet versions.",1457395200,,241,5.17948717948718

8720312,5,B00ZGWGRVI,"I liked this series. It was a joy to watch, with good characters, a nice story and, as usual for Korean tv, plenty of romance tinged with action.
The story is that the heroine "" Oh  Cho Rim "" comes home to find her parents murdered by the notorious serial killer known as "" The Bar Code Killer "" and , after seeing his face , runs away and is knocked down and ends up in a coma , waking up with no memory and with the new ability to see smells. When the serial killer sees her being struck by the car , he follows her to the hospital to finish the job but makes a mistake and kills the sister of the hero "" Choi Moo Gak "", who after finding his sister with her throat cut , loses the ability to feel anything. This all takes place in the first episode. The action starts 3 years later when she is trying to be a part of a comic troop and he his a cop. By the half way point in the series you know who the killer is and watch how he hides from discovery while playing games with our heroes. Of course the killer has a medical problem that makes it hard for him to tell who is who , so he has to rely on other ques i.e. voices etc...
The series has a nice almost screwball type romance between the hero and heroine with her asking him to help with a comedy sketch and in return she helps him solve crimes , which naturally makes them fall in love. It even has a "" shock "" ending that you could see coming a mile off. It even has good subtitles ( not every series is as good), but no martial arts.
All in all , it is an enjoyable way to spend your spare time watching this while relaxing on the sofa , but it is more like "" Death In Paradise"" than "" Luther"".
I hope you like this show as much as I did. If you like this sort of thing you will, if you don't, you won't. Say no more!",1453420800,,1778,3.8184281842818426

8720315,5,B00ZGWGRVI,"The show itself is awesome. Great combo of humor, romance, crime and thriller that made me unable to stop watching!! I adored all the characters. I still had a few questions I wish had been answered but I'm satisfied with the ending. The DVD quality is good, but it is obviously a DVR recording, and it has distracting writing scrolling along the bottom at times. It was a fairly decent translation. I wish some of the writing has been translated as well in pertaining to the connections made in the investigations, but I could figure it out eventually.",1441238400,2,553,4.653061224489796
