4953674,4,B0064SVNMQ,"An Israeli production, Rabies (2010) (aka Kalevet) is a very unconventional suspense thriller, featuring an odd assortment of characters, involved in a strange series of events in the woods.  What starts out as apparently some kind of abduction, expands to an extended drama, with several dark twists, as various situations spiral out of control.  If you keep an open mind, the resulting mayhem is quite entertaining, in a twisted sort of way.  Unless you speak Hebrew, you will be reading subtitles (English or Spanish), but that shouldn't prevent you from appreciating some fine acting performances.  Mild spoilers follow.

Two men and two women are in a car, driving through a wooded area.  They are headed somewhere to play tennis, when they hit someone on the road.  The victim, a man named Ofer (Henry David), says that his sister Tali is caught in an underground trap.  In a fateful decision, Mikey (Ran Danker) and Pini (Ofer Shechter), go with Ofer to find his sister.  The women, Shir (Yael Grobglas) and Adi (Ania Bukstein), remain at the car, and call the police for assistance.

Two officers are dispatched to investigate, and the dysfunctional pair are suspicious of the women's story.  Preoccupied by his disintegrating marriage, Danny (Lior Ashkenazi) is on the phone calling his wife, while Yuval (Danny Geva) searches the women, and takes the opportunity to explore under Shir's skirt.  Adi impulsively reacts to help her friend, and the girls flee into the woods, leaving a wounded cop behind.

After being pulled out of the trap, Tali (Liat Har Lev) is tired up and taken away by an unknown man (Yaron Motolla).  She eventually wakes to finds herself being carried by a park ranger (Menashe Noy).  Discovering the trap empty, her brother continues searching for her, while Pini and Mikey disagree about what they should do next.

The narrative moves forward linearly, but with characters spread out across the forest, the film doesn't have a solid core, as you lose touch with some of the players.  Rabies nicely sets up its audience for a series of shocks, which are delivered with force and style, often coming from an unexpected angle.  Most of these people have good intentions, but just make bad decisions, or snap at a critical point.

An interesting factor is the presence of live land mines in the Israeli woods.  Why the warning signs are lying on the ground, instead of being posted, is just another mystery.  The violence and gore is spread throughout the film, and is very well done in most instances.

The writing is not without issues, but the positives far outweigh the negatives, as there isn't much that is predictable about Rabies.  The acting performances are solid, and mostly enjoyable.  Not everyone seems realistic, as both cops are pretty screwed up in different ways.  Danny might be more likeable than Yuval, but he repeatedly demonstrates that at least on this day, he's just not a very smart cop.

The English translation appears to do an excellent job of capturing the nuances of the Hebrew dialog.  Rabies is a well made and impactful suspense thriller.  It never plays for laughs, but there are definitely some intensely dark comedic moments.  It's not really a horror film, but some terrible things happen, and fans of the terror in the woods might well appreciate this little gem.",1351641600,5,3333,4.922939068100359
4953675,4,B0064SVNMQ,"First off, yes, this movie is subtitled. Moving on.

Not what I expected at all. I see woods, I see Rabies, I'm thinking a rabid squirrel or something. Not the case whatsoever. Far stranger and off-the-wall than I imagined, but rather entertaining if you don't mind a lot of reading (subtitles). I'm not even going to go into any plot details as that would ruin the movie. Going into the movie believing the initial description makes all the unusual twists and actions that the characters undertake much more effective. And that is really the strength of this film, a clever interweaving of multiple storylines that have some unexpected outcomes. I'll end it there.

The acting is OK from what I could tell, not knowing what they were saying and/or how to react in some of the bizarre situations that occurred. The makeup and special effects were also decent. Writing was interesting and the strongest attribute of the film.

I would probably rate this as a strong 3.5 movie. People that are tolerant of subtitles will enjoy it far more than individuals that aren't. Again, some clever writing that isn't completely free from errors, but is certainly interesting! A quality movie for anyone who enjoys the horror/thriller category or just for someone looking for something new. Worth a watch.",1345680000,2,1292,4.91743119266055

4953677,3,B0064SVNMQ,"The movie was OK, but watching the trailer, I guess I was expecting something a little different. That's prob just me. The FX were not bad, and the actors were good. The movie left a few holes here and there, but all in all it was a bit creepy. It's worth a watch if you're looking for a movie with cute girls, bad cops and a strange killer. I gave it 3 out of 5 for the acting and the creepy atmosphere of the location and the slight feeling of dread throughout the film. Check it out for yourself.",1341100800,2,499,4.05050505050505
4953678,3,B0064SVNMQ,"If you ever want to see what Israelis can do with a horror flick, here's you're chance. First, there's the unfriendly forest, containing an unexploded mine field (don't ask why). Then there's the psychopath of the woods who sets traps to ensnare young women as victims. Then there's his victim of choice, a young woman trapped in a well and her brother, attempting to save her, if he can save himself first. Then there are two couples who get sidetracked when they accidentally hit the brother with their car and get sucked into the attempted rescue of his sister. Then there's a man doing a nature survey and his dog, who also tries to save the sister from the psychopath, with both good and bad results. Good for her, bad for him. Add two police officers to this mix, one of whom is a dangerous sexual predator, then stir the pot with all these characters and serve up what amounts to a bizarre slasher movie. As for the dog, don't ask. The title refers to many of characters, who act as if they were infected with rabies and have reached the mad stage. Perhaps, the title should have been ""Rabid"" instead. Some of this film is so gloriously over the top, it's hilarious. ""Rabies"" definitely earns a place in the So-bad-it's-good genre.",1333929600,3,1238,4.581081081081081
4953679,2,B0064SVNMQ,"I found this movie pretty boring with little to no story. It is hard to follow. I am under the impression its a cobbled together story about how certain people slowly become homicidle killers. It is all set in the same wooded national park setting, hence a super low budget filem.",1332288000,,280,4.509803921568627
4953680,3,B0064SVNMQ,".... unfortunately the scares never materialized. Good acting, characters played by major Israeli actors, but whole story somewhat farfetched and ridiculous. I understand this is Isreal's first attempt at making horror movies and they obviously need some more practice. The DVD released in Isreal containes Extras, while the U.S. version is bare bones only. Information above is incorrect. This movie was released theatrically in the U.S in 2011 while the theatrical realease in Israel was in Dec of 2010 (not that it really matters).",1330560000,3,534,5.369047619047619
4953681,5,B0064SVNMQ,"I don't want to give to much away about this Israeli film because I hate to read a review that gives too much info and then I'm waiting for something to happen that was written in that tell tale review or it's in the back of my mind and I keep thinking which one,when and where.

I will tell you that I enjoyed this Subtitled slasher/thriller/black comedy more than I have enjoyed any film in quite awhile.

It is very light on the comedy but it's just enough so it doesn't take itself too seriously.
There are also some good effects and plenty of blood.

It starts out with a serial killer/maniac in the woods who captures a woman in a trap and from there it goes into a multitude of mistaken identity's, mistrusts and betrayals as a foursome of twenty somethings get lost and make a wrong turn into The Killer's domain. Enter two cops an older couple and their dog and the fun and mayhem begins.
I loved it..Bravo",1330214400,11,915,4.3391812865497075
4953682,5,B0064SVNMQ,"I caught this hilarious film during Tribeca Film Festival. I just had to see what's the deal with the first Israeli slasher film. Boy, I was in for one giant surprise. the kind you look for in film festivals. It starts off like your typical slasher film and than it goes against all genre conventions: The killer on the loose; The heroic Virgin; The Last survivor. Everything is upside down in this horror comedy. It reminded me the originality of the first ""Scream"" movie (not the other two, they were not so good). Great Actors (also good looking), beautiful cinematography ( a slasher film shot entirely in day light-genius!!!), bad-ass soundtrack. I guess the crowd was delighted as me because they were roaring and clapping their hands every time somebody got slayed in this kick-ass adventure.",1327881600,10,799,4.882352941176471

4953701,5,B0064SVNMQ,This excellent unusual horror film is unpredictable and unique by the director of BIG BAD WOLVES. It features his dark sense of humor so if you liked BIG BAD WOLVES check this out. The strength of the script and acting more than compensate for the limited budget. It is more midnight movie fare with a faster pace than the dark brooding slow pace of BiG BAD WOLVES and much less disturbing.,1426550400,,390,4.507042253521127
4953702,4,B0064SVNMQ,"I love foreign horror films and must say that there are some countries that are really giving the U.S. a run for their money. Rabies is no exception. Although you can predict the ending about half way through, the ride you take to get there is well worth it. It is just so outrageous of a story you can't help but be mesmerized by the ridiculous actions the characters take. Watch and enjoy. Anything else to say gives away too much.",1423353600,,433,4.3580246913580245
4953703,5,B0064SVNMQ,"Bravo to Israel for not only putting out its first slasher movie, but having it be a really good one. This is an ensemble story with the sophisticated, loose structure that characterized Robert Altman at his best. The slasher isn't even the scariest character. Rather (spoiler alert) it's Danny Geva as Yuval, a corrupt and twisted police officer who gets his kicks fondling young girlsor maybe the scary part is how his partner covers for him.

p.s. This movie should win some award for letting there be cell phone service. Seriously, EVERY horror just about, from all over the world, has someone check their phone and say, ""No service.""",1403395200,,638,4.853211009174312
4953704,4,B0064SVNMQ,Great fun if you like lost in the woods genre films . I would be tempted to say you absolutely get what it says on the packet but of course you don't as there are no packs of Rabid dogs or frothing zombie style bitten humans . Well worth seeing and really looking forward to Big Bad Wolves .,1395705600,,291,3.9491525423728815
4953705,5,B0064SVNMQ,"It's monumental enough that this is the FIRST horror film to come out of Israel, but is it fair that it's also a brilliant story line, with superb acting, that's impeccably captured/directed? If you're looking for a genre film that challenges your thinking, this will not disappoint. Love this? Wait until you see their follow-up, Big Bad Wolves. Flawless.",1389657600,,356,5.0508474576271185
4953706,3,B0064SVNMQ,"A)  This is in Hebrew so most of us need the subtitles on.
B)  Though there may be a guy that's a killer he may be something else.  It seems that we never see him kill and we are never given that he actually trapped the girl at the start.  He may just be a psycho that stumbled across a woman trapped in a weird hole/box.
C)  Most of the characters have some darkness in their past and this seems to be the day that Karma catches up.  But some of the cast seem like they should have been left alone.
D)  And why are there several old mine fields left in this place [I think they said it was a fox sanctuary.  That's like leaving open containers of anti-freeze in a wildlife  preserve.
  The basic theme is groups of people [except for the maybe killer] randomly run into each other throughout the day- and it's a bad day for all.  There is nothing about ""RABIES"".  On all levels [except maybe story] it's not a bad film.  I wish it would have had English audio.",1386979200,,961,4.124324324324324
4953707,4,B0064SVNMQ,"The title of this film is perhaps a bit misleading... but the film itself serves as an unexpected adventure full of twists and shocking turns.  To be honest, I did not expect much, given the country of origin and the genre of movie, but this team did an amazing job from start to finish.  If you like 'thrillers' with some blood and violence thrown in to the mix, this is a great film.",1377648000,,385,4.260273972602739
4953708,4,B0064SVNMQ,"This movie is not about Rabies at all. Israeli made, (Please use the subtext), it starts nowhere, and goes

4953709,4,B0064SVNMQ,"A brother and sister who have run away from home. A car full of teens who have taken a wrong turn. A park ranger and his wife. Two questionable cops. What do all of these people have in common? They are lost in the woods with a psychopathic serial killer, who has set a series of sinister traps all throughout the park. RABIES is touted as being Israel's first venture into the Slasher genre, and it makes quite an entrance! Writer/Director team Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado take what would normally be familiar characters, settings, and situations, and create something wholly original. The pair introduce us to five distinct sets of characters, and manage to strike an intricate balance between them as the film progresses. Each new scene brings new surprises and unexpected twists at every turn, keeping audience members on edge from beginning to end! Keshales and Papushado have a gift for framing and editing each shot for maximum impact, which drives the tension and pitch-black humor higher than ever. Sharper than SEVERANCE, more clever than THE COTTAGE... RABIES takes the game of survival to a whole new level!

8492970,3,B0064SVNMQ,This is a really interesting slasher concept and the fact the filmmakers are from Israel gives it a whole different feel and perspective.
