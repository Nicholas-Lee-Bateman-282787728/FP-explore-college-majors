7751854,5,B01FUG4PPO,"Possibly the greatest raw action movie of the decade.  When other movies are trying to deliver messages, Vigilante Diaries takes you on an international roller coaster ride filled with dead bad guys, bullets, stuff blowing up and some of the best chick fighting scenes delivered to the screen since Kill Bill.  This is so exciting that you should be warned... ""Don't watch this movie if you have a heart condition because you will die""!",1467504000,4,436,4.878378378378378
7751855,4,B01FUG4PPO,"The Vigilante (Paul Sloan) is an Internet famous crime fighter. We get flashbacks of his origin through narration by Moreau (Michael Madsen), his former boss before Vigilante went rogue. He has a side kick, a photographer and is aided by others through some kind of network. He is currently doing battle against the proverbial Armenians as well as his former boss and Michael Jai White.

The film has a lot of formula action and cliche lines. It appears to spoof action films while trying to be one on its own. Red (Jessica Uberuaga) never appears dressed like she looks on the DVD cover. Grindhouse style entertainment. Seems like they want this to be a series.

Guide: F-word, nudity, at least three hot Asian chicks.",1466812800,7,719,4.790322580645161

7751863,4,B01FUG4PPO,"PLOT...
Vigilante diaries revolves around a team of black-ops agents turned crime-fighters, led by an elusive brooding anti-hero of weapon and physical skills, known only as the vigilante abandoned by governments corporations and his handlers and with a bounty on his head, the vigilantes mission exposes him to the dark and dangerous underworld of organised crime.

This movie is not without its flaws but on a whole its damn good fun as there is plenty of action and it has a great cast, the story is choppy and changy quite a bit and it can get a bit messy sometimes but its deal-able, the action on a whole is good, some scenes are a tad underwhelming but for a small budget movie there's allot crammed in, the budget on a whole is pretty decent for what it is there is some good effects considering they are CGI and the movie is pretty bloody in places with some good kills, mainly consisting of mass shootings and stabbing. The cast is brilliant and its one of the highlights of course, Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson, Paul Sloan, Michael Jai White and Michael Madsen are all really good, there is even some good comic relief from Jason Mewes who is on top form and laugh out loud funny, there are some babes too like Chasty Ballesteros and Jessica Uberuaga as Red (who does not get half as naked as she is on the cover) there is still some mild nudity elsewhere. on a whole the movie is great fun, it really feels like a 90's grindhouse style action thriller, there is potential here for a possible sequel too.

7751870,2,B01FUG4PPO,"Vigilante Diaries had all the makings of a fun, low-budget 80s/90s style action film. Its sort of a low-budget take on The Expendables series with a cast featuring Jason Mewes, Quinton rampage Jackson, Michael Jai White, Michael Madsen, former wrestler Chavo Guerrero, and Paul Sloan.vigilante

Sloan leads the cast as a former Middle East war vet turned vigilante, taking on numerous organized crime groups. Known simply, and uncreatively as The Vigilante his persona is heavily based on Marvel Comcs The Punisher; a brooding and violent anti-hero battling organized crime lords. His exploits are captured by commando web videographer Michael Hanover (Mewes) who puts the videos on the internet, turning The Vigilante into a worldwide sensation.

When the Vigilante kills the brother of an Armenian crime boss he is captured and tortured by a Mexican drug cartel who is holding him for the Armenians. The Vigilantes sidekick known simply as The Kid along with a wealthy, wise-cracking covert op named Gay Barry hires a group of mercenaries to rescue him from the Mexicans with Hanover outfitting them with cameras to record the action. And the action makes for great viewingpitched gun battles, explosions, and testosterone-fueled fights led by Jackson and Guerrero as the infiltrate the Mexican Cartel stronghold.

Unfortunately, once the Vigilante is freed the film begins to fall apart. A big factor in the success of the Expendables films is their sheer simplicity. You point the good guys in the direction of the bad guys and send them on their way with much chaos and violence ensuing. Vigilante Diaries isn't satisfied with just being a mindless action film, which is what it does best. Instead it wants to switch to a Mission Impossible style film, bloated with all manner of intrigue with shadowy government agencies and plots layered upon plots.

The Vigilante finds himself trapped in a dense web of covert operations nonsense that ends up detracting from the explosive fun of the first half of the film and the ride comes to an abrupt halt. The film is an adaptation of a web-TV series which Mewes co-produced but don't beat yourself up if you never saw it because frankly, neither did I.

Once the Vigilante is freed Sloan finds himself the center of the film and while he has some experienced talent around him he simply isn't up to the task of carrying the action. Mewes is Mewes. He is himself in every role and that can be good or bad depending on what you think of him. At 1 hour and 48 minutes the film is easily 20 minutes too long. If youve seen the series or have some time to kill theres certainly worse things you could do with your time but this one is lukewarm at best.",1469577600,2,2696,4.839479392624729
