6080981,4,B00GKL8NP2,"Beggars of Life is a drama of hobo life. Jim (Richard Arlen), a wanderer, comes upon young Nancy (Louise Brooks), who has just killed her guardian who was trying to rape her. Disguised as a boy, she takes off with Jim and rides the rails to a hobo camp led by Arkansas Snake (Robert Perry). When Oklahoma Red (Wallace Beery) takes over the camp, he begins to pursue Nancy, but before he can take her from Jim, the detectives show up to arrest her. Jim and Nancy escape, trying to make their way to Canada, but Red hasn't given up on her.

The film is based on the book of the same name by Jim Tully, who spent most of his teenage years in the company of hoboes. Drifting across the country as a road kid, he spent those years hiding in boxcars, sleeping in hobo jungles, steering clear of railroad cops, begging meals from back doors, and hanging out in public libraries. Beggars of Life is Tullys autobiographical look at Americas underclass.

Though the subject matter of the film is very dark, director William Wellman (Wings, The Ox-Bow Incident) gives it a good deal of flair with sequences filmed on a moving freight train. Though the period is the Roaring Twenties, when gin was flowing, the charleston was in vogue, and the country was enjoying post-World War I prosperity, the hobo community was hardly sharing the good times, living in the shadows, not knowing what the next day would bring, and constantly in fear of the authorities. Wellman captures that depressing atmosphere, blending it with a romantic subplot that offers optimism in a bleak series of events.

The 1928 black & white silent film has been digitally restored from 35-mm film elements preserved by the George Eastman Museum. Bonus materials on the unrated Blu-ray release include audio commentary by actor William Wellman, Jr.; audio commentary by the founding director of the Louise Brooks Society; booklet containing a critical essay; and musical score compiled and performed by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, employing selections from the original 1928 Paramount cue sheet.",1503532800,,2065,4.860795454545454
6080982,5,B00GKL8NP2,"This review is specifically for the new Kino Lorber release of this 1928 silent film.

A hobo (Richard Arlen) looking for something to eat barges into something more than he bargained for: a murder. A girl (Louise Brooks) has shot her caretaker for getting too grabby with her. (This is no spoiler-- it's literally the first two minutes of the film.) The hobo and the girl take it on the lam, and fall in with a crowd of hoboes dominated by Oklahoma Red (Wallace Beery); but the cops are closing inand Red has his own eye on the girl.

William Wellman claimed this was his favorite silent of his own, and I can believe that he at least had the most control he ever enjoyed in his life making a followup to his huge hit Wings, also with Arlen. But he also clearly liked the theme of the hobo life, since he returned to it five years later in a Depression era social drama, Wild Boys of the Road. But Beggars of Life is 1928, the height of pre-Wall Street crash prosperity, and it's basically a romance of hobo life, not only because there is an implicit romance in the way Arlen looks to protect Brooks at risk to himself, but because the whole picture of hobo society, its criminally-shaded rituals and the freedom of the open road it represents, is romanticized in a way that has grown more serious by Wild Boys' time. This is an adventure film, fast-paced and able to sweep you along as easily as any silent made, and certainly belongs in that group of end-of-the-era silents that seem to have complete mastery of the form like Sunrise, Seventh Heaven, The Last Command, Lonesome, and a few others.

The film is also remembered today for giving Louise Brooks her main serious role before she went off to Germany to work for Pabst on Pandora's Box. Although there are a couple of lost-film holes in her filmography, it seems pretty clear that this was the most notable time she got to play something with real dramatic heft, more than just vivacity (Love 'Em and Leave 'Em) or likability (It's the Old Army Game) on screen. That said, the fact is that as soon as Wallace Beery appears on screen full of braggadocio tinged with menace, it's his movie.

Kino's edition comes from a George Eastman House restoration from a high quality 16mm source, and though there are a few moments of outdoor photography that are a bit blown out, and a little deliberate softness typical of the era, overall image quality is terrific, proto-noirish in its shadowy way. The score by Mont Alto seems a touch Victorian for a picture that hints ahead to noir more than a few times, but I can believe that that was appropriate to the period. There are two commentary tracksone by William Wellman Jr., which based on a spot listen seems to be mostly historical about the production (with some personal reminiscences thrown in), and one by Thomas Gladysz which has more of a focus on Brooks but also covers hobo author Jim Tully and the history of turning his book into this movie.",1503273600,14,2958,4.544090056285178

It is not perfect but very watchable image wise.

Of course it would be very good if it could one day be available in tip top

an eventual pristine copy. It may happen. If it does I believe that it will be accepted
as a superior silent film and find a new and appreciative audience.",1453507200,3,516,4.212121212121212

8624087,5,B00GKL8NP2,"This is a terrific silent film, with a compelling story and beautifully filmed.  Louise Brooks is perfect, so beautiful and a much better actress than I had imagined as this is my first Brooks film.  And Richard Arlen is so ruggedly handsome and likable, the chemistry between these actors is natural and believable.  But when Wallace Beery shows up the film turns dark and unpredictable, you're on edge whenever Beery is on screen, he is a commanding presence.

8624088,4,B00GKL8NP2,"At its core Beggars of Life is a love story. Two kids get thrown together under dire circumstances and fall hard for each other along the way. Louise Brooks' character has committed murder, and Richard Arlen's is a tramp on the road to Canada. Neither has a penny to their name and just their legs, stout hearts, and grit and determination to keep them going.

The life of hobos is explored in several vignettes set in a jungle and within boxcars, and inside abandoned shacks et al. The various character actors play their parts excellently. Especially Wallace Beery who gives a performance ranging from cruel lust to almost tender affection and in the end he gives his all. Brava Mr. Beery.

However, Miss Brooks steals the show with her beautiful expressive face. There's no doubt what she's thinking, you know exactly, and you viscerally feel her emotions. You'll sympathize with her character from the first frame she appears.

Brooks. Is. That. Talented.

Of course she didn't stick around Hollywood too long afterward, coming under the wing of director GW Pabst with whom she went on to make Diary of a Lost Girl and famously Lulu. But in BOL Brooks is still in the US, and in BOL she appears the least fettered and the most natural of all the various films I've seen her act in thus far.",1509235200,2,1294,4.662280701754386

8624093,5,B00GKL8NP2,"First of all, Kino Lorber's blu-ray edition of film legend Louise Brook's silent classic Beggars of Life was released in August, 2017.  Amazon has dumped a lot of old reviews of the dismal Grapevine Video DVD release into this same space. So if you see reviews dated before 2017, don't waste your time reading those because they are not the same release.

Having said that, Beggars of Life is one of my favorite Louise Brooks films. For years all I could find was the Grapevine Video DVD of this film that has such poor picture quality that it is barely watchable.

I'm thankful that Kino Lorber has released this important silent film in an excellent blu-ray edition. I've seen this film many times, and finally owning this edition is like seeing it for the first time. Kino Lorber has done an amazing job with the entire package.

The restoration of Beggars of Life was financed by The Film Foundation, an organization founded and administered by legendary film directors and historians Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg.

Film elements used in the restoration came from the George Eastman House collection.  Eastman House was responsible for spearheading Louise Brooks' renaissance along with the gathering and preservation of many of her films.

Beggars of Life was released in 1928 making it a late era silent film, and it was directed by iconic director William Wellman who also directed Wings, the first film to win the Best Picture Academy Award.

The lead actors Louise Brooks, Richard Arlen, and Walkace Beery are all superb in a film that touches on murder, poverty, people who are homeless and displaced, and a young couple on the run from the law.

Beggar's of Life predates the classic 1940's film Sullivan's Travels, and may have influenced portions of that film.  Both films, however, are amazing examples of the vagabond way of life.

The excellent commentary for this film is provided by William Wellman, Jr., the son of the director, and by Thomas Gladysz, the founding director of the Louise Brooks Society. Both of these gentlemen provide information about the making of the film and the actors that is fun, informative, and very enlightening.

Music is wonderfully performed by The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra that both blends in with the action and enhances the overall viewing experience with Beggars of Life.

Silent films were never silent, and music always played an important role with these films.  Oftentimes music was provided by a piano in hometown theaters, or a pipe organ in larger theaters, and full orchestras in grand theater palaces. But music was always there to complete the silent film viewing experience.

Lastly, the colorful, picture-filled booklet and informative essay by Nick Pickerton add a nice touch to this entire package.  As Pickerton points out about Beggars of Life, ""to go tramping was to reject the cult of hearth, home, mother, and the Protestant work ethic wholesale.""

Beggars of Life presents a beautifually photographed portrait that is tough, gritty, realistic, and also a touching story that goes against the norm, especially in the context of 1920's cinema.

Louise Brooks is a film legend, and rightly so. This new blu-ray release is well worth buying, enjoying, and adding to any film collection.  Long live Louise Brooks, and thank you Kino Lorber for breathing new life into her work.",1504051200,20,3364,5.007181328545781
8624094,4,B00GKL8NP2,"BEGGARS OF LIFE is one of those legendary movies that silent film fans have read about but rarely had an opportunity to see, Chances are that if you have seen it, it's been in some poor public domain copy of a copy which some of the other reviews clearly attest to. Now, thanks to Kino Lorber and the George Eastman House, the wait is over. This new release (BLU-Ray and DVD) is the best the movie has ever looked. While not a Murnau Foundation or a Photoplay restoration, it's still a cause for celebration especially for Louise Brooks fans who get to see her in her best American film. Shortly after this she would go to Germany and the rest is cinematic history

BEGGARS OF LIFE is quite remarkable for its vivid portrayal of hobo life in a pre-Depression America and for the opening sequence of Louise Brooks under attack from her guardian who tries to rape her. The frankness of the material caught me off guard and then I marveled at how skillfully William Wellman directed the scene through the use of overlaps. After such a powerful opening the movie lapses somewhat until the entrance of Wallace Beery 30 minutes later. It's his film and he easily outshines Richard Arlen (WINGS) but Brooks manages to hold her own. In her biography LULU IN HOLLYWOOD she talks about how Beery stood up for her during the filming. Although remembered today only for his sound roles, Beery was a superb silent film actor who had great facial expressions.

On the run from the law, Brooks and Arlen hop rides and get thrown off of trains until they land in a hobo jungle. Although Louise is dressed as a boy it doesn't take the hobos long to figure out that she isn't and they come after her only to be stopped by Beery who wants her for himself. Once again we see things from Brooks' perspective of what it's like to be a woman among men who have only one thing on their mind. There is a kangaroo court sequence which is both comic and full of tension as we know what the outcome of it will mean. After this the movie becomes rather predictable in an Old Hollywood way but Wallace Beery manages to turn the ending into something memorable.

As I mentioned earlier, the restoration is very good but it isn't great. There are some contrast issues and although advertised as 35mm, parts of it sure do look like they come from 16mm but then's that's probably the best there is or at least the best we're likely to see on home video. The score by Rodney Sauer's Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra (one of the best at this sort of thing) uses some of the original 1928 music which helps to keep the viewer in the proper mood. All in all a top notch release of an American silent film classic than can finally find the larger audience it deserves. A must for Louise Brooks fans or for Wallace Beery fans like myself.",1503619200,10,2800,4.443579766536965
