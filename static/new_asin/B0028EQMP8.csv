3872475,4,B0028EQMP8,"Bubba Mabry's family has an embarrassing tendency towards public gullibility, a trait he is determined not to exhibit himself. His grandfather holds the sad distinction as being the only fatality of the Martian invasion during the original 1939 ""War Of The Worlds"" radio hoax. Bubba may not be Albuquerque's most successful private detective, operating from a seedy Motor Inn on Route 66 amid hookers and dope dealers. But when a man named J.G., sporting mounds of gold jewelry, hires him as a bodyguard to protect a visiting celebrity from an overzealous fan, Bubba sees it as easy money. Until the celebrity seems to be the living Elvis determined to keep a low profile and the fan turns out to be a sleazy tabloid reporter who is determined to break the story that the King is still alive. While the movie has the look of a low budget film, it certainly doesn't feel like one. The characters are clich and the acting is exaggerated, but that is all positive, because it perfectly fits the comical style of the movie. Another strong point is that the acting performances were pretty stable throughout the whole movie. Especially the main character is charismatic enough to keep you interested. The plot is surprisingly fresh and keeps you guessing right up to the end. All in all, this was a fun ride and worth watching. If you don't need big names and huge budgets to enjoy a movie, then this might be one you could enjoy.",1268611200,4,1425,4.704
3872476,4,B0028EQMP8,"I'd read the book, the book was pretty good.  Then I saw the movie starring Jay, well, it had to be okay.  It was better than that.  It should have hit the theaters, it's just funny.  Robert Patrick going from Terminator to the King?  Wow, it was just amazing.  Elvis is alive, he's being hunted by the tabloids -what a surprise, he needs a detective and finds a fellow southern boy to do the job. Bubba is kind of a bumbler,but he gets the job done.

I couldn't belive the cast - Robert King, Joe Montegna, Katt Williams, Nikki Cox,  the make-up guys who reproduced Elvis in his 70's - no jumpsuits in site, excellent!  Highly recommend, music is outstanding as well.",1266883200,2,668,4.409836065573771
3872477,5,B0028EQMP8,"Most of your straight to DVD releases are ok or just ok. & you understand them not being released in theaters. But in my opinion as a true American that is not a stuck up paid movie reviewer. Cant believe this didn't make the big screen or even a great ABC,CBS or NBC Special movie presentation before DVD release. This movie is worth every dollar!!! Great actors! Every one of em! They worked great as a team & made this story believable! & best of all the protayal & work put into making the dream of Elvis being here with us came true! I can & you will also see that they all truly put their HEART in to bringing Elvis back respectably. The dvd is also loaded with extras. Which made me happy. you have the movie,the making of the movie,the making of the king. & Three GREAT songs from the movie. ""when the rebal comes home' is a GREAT song plus the video of it is great also. I say buy it! & i say thanks to all involved in bringing this movie to us.",1258070400,2,954,4.106951871657754
3872478,5,B0028EQMP8,"While the premise for Lonely Street is far-fetched, the actors made it believable. The role of Mr. Aaron (who underwent long makeup sessions) was convincing, possessing all the mannerisms of Elvis. Bubba was as bumbling as expected. An Indie film that went straight to DVD, it certainly would have filled some theaters in some markets if it had gone to the big screen...well, medium screen these days.
Thank you, thank you very much...
Book author Steve Brewer who wrote the book the movie is based on has many books available.",1253318400,4,527,4.866666666666666
3872479,4,B0028EQMP8,"We saw this movie on the big screen in a theatre in Bartlett (Memphis) Tennessee.  We four Elvis fans loved how Robert Patrick portrayed Elvis at 75.  The make-up was great, and Robert did a great job of bringing a healthy Elvis to life.  The movie was funny, and if you're an Elvis fan, you'll really enjoy how he is represented in this movie.",1253059200,8,344,4.34375
3872480,4,B0028EQMP8,"Okay, straight to DVD didn't hold much promise, but I couldn't resist the price. The truth is, it's really rather good. I agree with other viewers, the actor playing Elvis was superb. And don't miss the video (under special features) ""When the Rebel Comes Home"" - worth the price of the DVD alone. Entirely plausible, you could well imagine this is what the King would have looked like if he'd lived and decided to make a comeback - and I'm not even remotely an Elvis fan. P.S. Ignore the review saying Jay Mohr is constantly naked throughout; there is no nudity, male or female.",1251676800,13,579,4.576923076923077
3872481,4,B0028EQMP8,"Very funny, quirky comedy with a terrific cast.  The premise is truly unique - that Elvis is alive, he's a health nut, and he needs protection from a tabloid journalist who may be on to him.  Robert Patrick shows some terrific comedic chops as Elvis - his makeup is impressive - I actually think this is what he'd look like if he were still alive and practiced yoga.  Jay Mohr is funny as the sad-sack rube detective he hires and Joe Mantegna sports a pony tail as a sleazy music producer.  It's all very tongue-in-cheek, reminiscent of a Barry Sonnenfeld movie.",1248825600,8,562,4.534653465346534
3872482,4,B0028EQMP8,"If you are looking for a funny movie that has an idea that has not been beat to the ground like so many, this is the one! Cast is good and Robert Patrick as the KING is worth the price of the film alone!",1246406400,11,203,3.6363636363636362
3872483,5,B0028EQMP8,I watched this hoping for some nudity but unfortunetly it was only Jay Mohr showing full frontal and not Nikki Cox. In fact Jay would sometimes just whip it out in the middle of a scene where it seemed completely off the wall.,1246406400,3,226,4.27906976744186
3872484,5,B0028EQMP8,Great movie if you're an Elvis fan,1431129600,,34,4.0
3872485,3,B0028EQMP8,"It's a bit cheesy and predictable like most dumbed down formulaic films of today. I bought it because i'm a huge Elvis fan and the best part of this silly film is the make up department for the film. At times in certain light the plaster mask Robert Patrick wears gives a haunting image of Elvis in hs seventies. It was fun to see ""Elvis"" (even re created by plaster) on the screen again. Of course there are a few scenes where the stupid director overplays the Elvis persona into a cartoon and Elvis would NEVER have compared himself to Jesus or play golf as he does in this film but if you can get past the idiotic crap and just catch those few moments where it seems Elvis is still alive then it's an okay collection from the bargain bin.
My thing is... IF they can recreate someone's face with rubber this real then why not use it on a more well written and meaningful film? I mean suppose this make up could have been used in the film ""The Thing about Kings"" where Elvis had faked his death and wanted to live a normal life but he also wanted to be with Lisa Marie and possibly re-unite with Priscilla? It would have been haunting and powerful. But that's the way formula crazy stupid Hollywood does things.",1430352000,2,1212,4.3201754385964914
3872486,4,B0028EQMP8,"THE MOVIE WAS A LITLE BORING AT THE BEGINNING TILL THE MAIN CHARACTER, ELVIS BEGAN SHOWING UP IN THE MOVIE. WHEN HE DID, IT WAS AMAZING. THIS MOVIE EVIDENTLY WASN'T MUCH OF A SUCCESS AS I WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT WHEN IT CAME OUT AND IT WOULD HAVE MADE WAVES IN THE ENTERTAINMENT CIRCLES.

3872494,4,B0028EQMP8,Robert Patrick portrayed Elvis at 75. He did a great job of portraying a healthy Elvis in his senior years. The movie is funny and was cast very well. The story is a thrill. It's great to see ELVIS ALIVE. This movie is uplifting. I recommend it.,1397347200,2,245,4.23404255319149

I not only love and recommend this movie I am giving to two people for Christmas.  This movie is uplifting........ totally.  You might want to read on the web what Robert Patrick had to say about his role of Elvis. Thank you Robert ......I actually see and feel what you meant.,1323993600,5,437,4.551282051282051

3872502,4,B0028EQMP8,"I love Indies, as these often super-low-budget productions are the product of people who truly love movie-making, so passionately that they will find ways to tell their story on the budget of a major film's trailer. While many wind up 'Straight-to-Video', these films are often far richer, intriguing, and worthwhile, than the big-budget tripe at the multiplex theaters!

Saying this, I will admit that 2009's ""Lonely Street"", a delightfully off-kilter comedy directed by Peter Ettinger, may not be your kind of tale. The plot, involving the resurrection of the presumed-dead ""King of Rock and Roll"" (a heavily made-up, dead-on Robert Patrick), a blue-collar, flaky P.I. (co-producer/star Jay Mohr), and the murder of a sleazy, very flatulent tabloid photographer (John F. O'Donohue), occasionally tilts towards gross humor and language, and a somewhat brain-dead 'good ol' boy' point of view. But if you can hang in there, the film may win your heart with it's quirky logic, and an array of odd-ball characters inhabiting a 'trailer-park'-envisioned Albuquerque, New Mexico, offering a charm uniquely their own. These roles are played by first-rate actors (including Joe Mantegna, as a cut-rate record producer, Ernie Hudson and Paul Rodriguez as cops, Katt Williams as a dim-bulb 'street hood', Mike Starr, as the King's bodyguard, and Nikki Cox as a voluptuous reporter/player), and their name-value alone makes the film worth watching. Co-star Lindsay Price, as another reporter (and Mohr's 'love interest'), shows a flair for keeping a straight face in truly bizzare situations, and is a stand-out, as well.

This is certainly no 'classic', but I really enjoyed this silly, crazy feature, and at the list price, you're getting a real bargain, too...Check it out!",1280016000,,1767,5.35251798561151
3872503,4,B0028EQMP8,"From the Terminator cop to Elvis, Robert Patrick has now a place in my hall of true actors and Joe Mantegna shows versatility too. The movie keeps you entertained all long. It is a comedy, not a stupid hilarious one but a smart one. A few ""F"" words makes this movie R rated. The love scenes are nothing worst than those shown on TV or movies like the Twilight series so I didn't have a problem watching it with my 14 year old walking in the room. Why 4 stars? It is not Titanic, Star Wars or Gone With the Wind. This movie is a lot better than hundreds that have been (and I'm sure still will be) released to the big screen.",1276387200,4,624,4.08130081300813

8356134,3,B0028EQMP8,"This film is a fun, tongue-in-cheek bit of a romp. It's corny and silly. It's a cuddle on the couch with your significant other with cold beverages and popcorn kind of movie. Neither ultra-macho, nor chick-flick, nor something to keep you locked in if your attention wanders....

I'm hearing impaired, and closed-captions would have helped, but I didn't have any trouble following the plot. If your in the mood for something light and kitschy with Lonely Street at least you won't be wishing you could get your 88 minutes back.",1444089600,,527,4.855555555555555

Unfortunately not in this movie though, or anyone else in this movie for that matter. Stupid plot, bad dialogue. It didn't even seem to be making fun of these kind of stories which might have made it funny-ish.",1433289600,,370,4.3768115942028984
