293278,1,6300215881,"Oh God, this particular bluray/DVD, is a German company so-called fake restoration release, It's purely just a copy transfer from an almost over used LD (laser disk), onto a bluray media...,the opening credits redone in watery waste, plus the pain to get the media to play.

I didn't expect Germans for such a dupe, they're great manufacturers of autos and industrial manufacturing, the film industry should solely be left to the American giants.",1479772800,,446,5.109589041095891

293280,2,6300215881,"I remember writing a review of Marlon Brando in ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" and it's about the same with this movie: Brando's acting is so over the top as to be amusing, in an unintended way. I mean, Karl Malden tries to give this sleepy film some motivation, but I'm always concentrating on Brando's odd acting technique. Great photography. Love the locations, and I always love it when Hollywood films go down to the nearby Pacific Ocean for backdrop. Cornball movie overall.",1477612800,,473,4.780487804878049

293369,5,6300215881,"I love Marlon Brando movies. He plays them like David Lean directs movies, letting the viewer know as much background about the role and movie as is possible given the time, to do it. One-eyed Jacks was directed by Brando. I think he was too good an actor to have the patience to direct another movie. The actors he would direct would tax his sense of reality, the kind he wanted portrayed. One-eyed Jacks is about betrayal, the anguish of seeking revenge and love, a love that makes the revenge-seeker have second thoughts about acting on his motivations. Malden, Jurado and Pellicer gave dazzling performances, along with Brando's, Ben Johnson's and Larry Duran's. I thought Duran [Modesto[ was the ultimate friend to Rio [Brando's character] and gave the Brando character a sense of hope. One of my favorites. Oh, and the movie is about a mother's love for her daughter, born out of wedlock. It's a wonderful foil against the backdrop of violence that made the love possible and credible..",1463356800,,992,4.841176470588235

293442,1,6300215881,"This movie is clunky, and wavers unhappily between a traditional western and a revisionist western. Brando directs, I guess, but it seems like a movie that thinks it's pushing the envelope but (at least to modern eyes and ears) isn't. There are a bunch of other bad 60s westerns in this category (see Bandolero!) that think they're shocking and full of anti heroes but now just seem stilted.",1454889600,,391,4.764705882352941

The story's pretty dark though. The only honorable character in the entire movie is Rio's (Brando) sidekick. And he gets wasted before the last chapter.

293455,4,6300215881,"My rating is 4 1/2 for the film, no rating for the quality of this Blu-ray release, since I have not viewed it.  Poor image quality is prevalent in most of the comments regarding OEJ for this blu-ray and the many SD DVDS offered so Ill address that concern, only saying that the film is excellent as others have well described.  I have at least two other disk versions derived from the public domain sources that are terrible.  Thanks to another Amazon commentors recommendation, I purchased and can attest to the very good image-quality DVD from  Centipede Films, albeit PAL, Zone 0.  It is contained in a double-pack with both a soundtrack CD and the DVD and can be found here on Amazon, not in the Movies/TV category, but under Amazons music /CD category where it is offered by numerous sellers.  The case is CD-size, not DVD-sized, and has a black cover with gold top bar accent and a black and white photo of Brando behind jail bars talking to Pina Pellicer.  The caveat is that the Centipede release is a Region 0 DVD so you need a multi-region player or a laptop that will read it.  Since my Region 1 Samsung BD 5900 player would not read the disk, I played it on my HP laptop blu-ray drive, which reads multi-region, and connected it to my Samsung 6300 TV as a second monitor and enjoyed an excellent image and sound.  The print was very clean and crisp and in the correct 1.85:1 ratio of the VistaVision process.  Runtime on the Centipede disk is 2:16 (136 min.) and it is English Language with a Spanish language option and with Spanish subtitle option only, but no English subtitles offered.  The CD is the excellent soundtrack by Hugo Friedhofer and it does play on my US CD changer.",1451606400,,1695,4.506535947712418

293536,2,6300215881,"One Eyed Jacks has always been one of my favorite ALT westerns from the pre-Wild Bunch era, distinguished by some intriguing performances from great method actors at the peak of their young lives, some self indulgent directing by Brando, that drove the production way over budget and studio executives crazy, and unique settings for a western in Monterrey and Carmel. I cant say that I like this Blu-Ray however. How to put it? It sucks. It appears to be a 1080p upscale from a transfer originally made for 480i TV, and maybe not even for DVD. The colors are flat, the noise reduction, sharpening and haloing is rampant and all over the place. Surface textures are smeared. Skin looks like wax. The frame appears cropped. Sound is mediocre. In short, it appears to be a very poor old TV transfer of a German market release print. Ugh. This is a beautiful and in many ways unique film. It deserves to be restored from the original VistaVision elements and given a solid release. If you have to have a Blu-Ray copy of this film this may be the only option. But it is also available on Amazon streaming currently, although the transfer available from Amazon is even worse than the one used on this Blu-Ray. .",1438041600,,1205,4.609302325581395

293569,1,6300215881,"WARNING! The video quality is REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD. It has serious digital compression issues (ala macroblocking) and looks to be a 1080p upconvert of a PAL video source (as it has German credits and a French Paramount logo). I mean, its an AVC MPEG-4 encode for petes sake AND YET IT LOOKS LIKE A BADLY COMPRESSED YT VIDEO! I've seen 1080p MPEG-2 encodes (ala the 1st BD of Predator) and DVDs that look way, way better than this shoddy transfer! It also appears to be incorrect ratio and framing is a bit tight at times (seems like they used a cropped 4:3 master that was matted to 1.66:1 then zoomed in to 16:9). There is also a trailer in 4:3 letterbox culled from a VHS source, and has a really choppy frame rate.

 Audio options are German and English DTS Master Audio 2.0 mono and seem OK, but the recording quality on both is quite tinny and squelchy due to source material used. However, around the 45:00 min mark, the English audio goes completely out of sync as it switches to an even lower quality source (it sounds so bad, it seems like they used a horribly compressed, low quality MP3 for the last half of the film). As One Eyed Jacks has been released on DVD (in full screen I believe) by every PD label in the U.S, this Blu may not be much better than those but it is in widescreen, abit with tight framing. However, whoever mastered this disc seriously needs to refrain from using heavily compressed YT soruces (legal issues or not). It seems E1 in general gives really shoddy treatment to old classic films unless it something visually flashy and annoying, even on Blu-ray. Also, does anyone remember the 1st 1939 Gulliver's Travels ""widescreen"" BD they put out with Koch Media, this rings a similar bell to it in terms of video quality but thank gosh this one isn't DNR'd to hell.

This is essential viewing for Marlon Brando fans as it is the only movie he directed; performing quite well behind the camera. It is also a superb Western, with Brando in the lead role. Running from the law after a bank robbery in Mexico, Dad Longworth (Karl Malden) finds an opportunity to take the stolen gold and leave his partner Rio (Brando) to be captured and imprisoned. Five years later, Rio escapes from prison and hunts down Dad for revenge. Dad is now a respectable sheriff in Monterrey, California; and has been living in fear of Rio finding him. That will set the stage...watch it to see how it plays out. In addition to Brando and Malden, look for Katy Jurado as Dad's wife; Pina Pellicer as Louisa, Dad's stepdaughter and Rio's love interest; Ben Johnson as Rio's sidekick and Slim Pickens as Dad's deputy sheriff. Brando interweaves themes of betrayal, revenge and hypocrisy into something strangely hypnotic and real.

Brando falls in love with Malden's adopted daughter and as you would figure, the fire is fanned to he smoldering point for Malden when he finds out she's carrying Brando's baby. Seeing no other choice, Malden sets out to kill Brando in cold blood, with startling results. Unlike others who commented on the transfer quality, the DVD of the film I received is NOT a cheap German version with a bad transfer, both the picture and sound are actually quite clear and crisp, like that of the versions you see when it is shown on cable.

Everything about this film is first rate from the writing and direction to the costumes. It's a long movie but doesn't come off as being long, and when it's over, you actually want it to go on longer. One Eyed Jacks is another testament to Hollywood's best era, when they could truly tell a story the RIGHT way. 5+++ stars overall",1408665600,,1591,4.562937062937063

293850,4,6300215881,"Five EXCELLENT Stars for the movie; Three and a half Stars for the remastering. Four Stars Overall. One of the best westerns of all time. A marvelous tale of robbers, betrayal, love, and revenge. In the world of Western Movies, there are those which fall into the categories of 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' (to quote a famous Clint Eastwood `spaghetti western' title), but a favorite movie of many is the sole combined directorial and acting effort of one of our greatest actors, Marlon Brando, who seized directorial control after the screenplay went through the hands of Rod Serling, Stanley Kubrick, Sam Peckinpah, and others. Based loosely on the book, ""The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones"" by Charles Neider, the film has tremendous acting, cinematography, writing, and music. Brando's execution of scenes in authentic-looking towns, deserts (the `hot on their heels' chase through the dusty canyon is a cinematic feat that many directors miss out on), and the Monterey California scenery is mesmerizing. The acting of Brando, and an all-star cast that included Karl Malden, Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens, an upcoming star-crossed actress named Pina Pellicer who generates sparks in her scenes with Brando and Katy Jurado, Larry Duran, and others is stupendous and intense. The director's cut was over 4 hours, cut down to 2 hours and 22 minutes for theatrical release.

Following a successful bank robbery in Sonora Mexico in 1880, ""Kid Rio"", ""Doc"" and ""Dad"" Longworth are hunted down by the relentless Mexican `Rurales' police force. Dad and Rio are cornered in a canyon. Longworth goes for additional horses but never returns, leaving Rio to be captured and spend years in a Mexican prison. These opening scenes are riveting but the best is yet to come. Watching Rio tracking Longworth's location for his revenge, the fascinating complex interrelations that result, and the climatic showdown scenes are all part of a marvelous feat of movie-making that Brando would only do once in his long career, since it took about 4 over-budgeted years to get it to the screen in final form. This movie also has a lovely haunting musical theme and supporting music by Oscar-winning composer Hugo Friedhofer. The main theme became a minor hit by pianists Ferrente and Teicher. Remastering quality notwithstanding, it is a marvelous film that gets My Highest Recommendation. Five BLAZING Stars for the movie. Four REMASTERED Stars overall.

I thought Marlon Brando was just about the most wonderful, romantic person, and wished I could fly into his arms. Times have changed, and in watching this movie I was struck by the fact that the music was too loud, the acting was a little forced, editing was not so good, and Marlon Brando mumbled. Perhaps as an historical example of his work (he also directed this piece), this movie should be seen, but the hero I loved in my youth turned out to be a criminal who mumbled.

If the people that turned out this shabby mess had deliberately tried to come up with an unwatchable travesty, it would be hard to imagine how the result could have been worse.  The banner over the top of the front cover states that it is digitally remastered.  If this is the case, we must assume that their source material was a bad 8mm print.  It is dark; the color is muddy and terrible, and the image looks about as fuzzy and low-resolution as any home video product you are ever likely to encounter.  We continue to hope that, if Paramount continues to neglect this hard-hitting title, that they might at least provide the original VistaVision elements to an outfit like Criterion, or Twilight Time Entertainment so that people who care about releasing quality editions of films could do it justice.

293975,5,6300215881,"I almost missed this movie due to the low rating which centers around the poor DVD remaster rather than the story itself.  I watched it on prime streaming so it was of similar quality to any other 60's era movie being streamed.

""One-Eyed Jacks"", referring to a person with a hidden side or past to them, is an aptly titled western about two best friends who happened to be bank robbers, and the aftermath that comes when one betrays the other over a satchel of gold.  The betrayed friend catches up with his old ally five years later to settle the score.

This is a tale of moral choices and their consequences.  The story uses the two friends, identical in most ways, to illustrate the different paths our lives can take based on the choices we make and the lies we tell.  Rather than ruin the movie, I'll leave it at that.

I will say, however, that I particularly liked the first half-hour of the movie.  The dialogue in this part is crisp and pointed and Brando's soft-spoken delivery gets across the burning intensity of his character that lies just under the surface.  This was the first time I'd seen Brando in a movie and I can see why he's a Hollywood legend.

I don't think this is a true western in the sense that it is not really a gun fighting movie with a lot of horse chases and fast drawing and the more typical theme of the western hero defending the innocent or the unarmed, neither is it an outlaw movie where the outlaw gang is on the run from the posse the whole movie through.

293981,5,6300215881,"Marlon Brando directed this adult western that helped break the western movie mold back in the 1960s. There are themes of friendship, betrayal, revenge, bigotry, lust, deceit, hypocrisy, redemption and love in this pedestrian-paced western. Marlon Brando is magnificent as Rio, the soft-spoken bank robber who is wronged by his friend, Dad Longworth (Karl Malden - in one of his best roles). After having been abandoned to the Mexican Rurales (led by Rudolfo Acosta) after a bank robbery in Sonora, Mexico and spending five years in a Mexican prison, Rio hunts down his former partner, Dad Longworth. In a turn of fortune, Longworth is now 'reformed' and the wealthy sheriff of a coastal town, Monterey, California.  Replete with a family, (Maria) a former widow (Katy Jurado)and Louisa, her grown daughter (Pina Pellicer), Rio pays a call on Dad Longworth. One follows is a bit melodramatic as a forbidden romance results between Louisa and Rio, a gunfight, betrayal by Rio's new gang  Ben Johnson and Sam Gilman), the loyal friendship of his former prison friend, Chico (played Larry Duran) and the final stand-off between Dad and Rio. The movie itself is characterized by scenes and situations which were taboo at the time: the lustful advances of a red-neck and abusive deputy (well-played by Ben Johnson), the brutal horse-whipping and hand-smashing by Dad, the abuse of a dancer by a drunkard, and the murder of Rio's unarmed friend.

There is a genuine feel due to beautiful cinematography and solid appropriate dialogue. Brando's mumbling makes some lines hard to understand, especially in his romantic scenes. Brando does utter some great insults like ""scum-sucking pig"" and ""a big tub of guts"".

This western classic is slow-paced and 2 hours and 21 minutes long but it is worth the time. Brando filmed a colorful, disturbing and dramatic western that is very character-driven.  Watch this with your eyes wide open and do not flinch.",1392249600,,1943,5.09748427672956

It's a revenge flick with Brando playing the outlaw Rio who falls out with his outlaw friend Dad Longworth played with supreme villainy by Karl Malden. Along the road to revenge Rio picks up a few more bad characters including Ben Johnson who seemed to appear in most of the great westerns of that era. Brando is far from a virtuous John Wayne-type hero, but his characterization of Rio and the other outstanding performances by the co-stars makes the film move at all times. Of course Slim Pickens is in this one as well playing a snake. Forget all the negative reviews you might have read (if you're old enough) when this came out.

Although, from the time I first viewed it, I wondered what a one-jack was (I don't play any type of card game). The jacks on playing cards is printed in profile, so only one eye is seen, and never the other side of the face (in poker, these are usually set as wild cards). Both Marlon and Karl's character's is just that, wild, portraying themselves as womanizers; tough, lawless, and eventually showing the other side of their face. The acting of all is superb, even minor players, the story A-1, the music, beautiful. Watching it again, it still kept me on the edge of my seat, so to speak. There was one curse word, which was removed, and doesn't detract from the scene. I suppose some may not like the ending, thinking it leaves things up in the air, but it's the way it was done then. It leaves you with hope, that Rio will indeed return, taking his love away to a better life. Rio was the glue, holding the whole movie together, as one watches him transform from a vengeful, escaped prisoner, to a man totally opposite from what he was at the beginning. I believe this could be a family movie, if the parents engage their children in discussion afterwards. Certain men still today go to elaborate lengths, scheming to get a woman in bed. I'm not sure Rio's sudden turn-around happens in real life though. But, the whole point of the movie, was that these one-eyed-jacks, these wild-cards, when they showed the other side of their face, was not only opposite from each other, but one ceased to be wild.",1378512000,,1664,4.663265306122449

And there's one scene where he explodes that just about trumps anybody else's similar character unraveling. The rest of the cast is very good. Karl Malden is superb and Slim Pickens is almost perfect. Do yourself a favor. Turn out the lights and watch this one alone first. Because you're going to want to rewind a couple of times.

It is a shame Brandon never directed another movie. In fact, if I have a criticism of Brandon is that he did not make enough movies. It  seems that the same smoldering performances that made his performances so dangerous and powerful, also, made him difficult and tempermental. Any chance to watch Brando on screen is always a treat, except for Last Tango in Paris, which practically put me to sleep with my eyes open.

294062,5,6300215881,"This is a superb western placed mainly on California's coast at Monterey. The dramatic scenery is great, the acting is great. Brando is the named director though I suspect the director of photography helped out a bit. This is the old revenge story, but is done extremely well and it is much more than that. The subtext, and the arc of this script is this: Brando plays the Rio Kid, who has never been anything but a gunslinging bank robber, liar, and woman chaser. So he falls for the daughter of his arch enemy and it changes him. The love story unfolding is moving. Pina Pellicer is excellent as the daughter, as are the other cast members, Karl Malden, Katy Jurado. There is some violence, though not as excessive as movies today. It is difficult find a good copy of this movie; Paramount gave up the license and lousy copies abound. Amazon's version is better than most, though the color fades a bit.

+edit: This movie is so captivating that I actually didn't noticed how bad the video was after awhile. It is not your typical western and well worth a watch. The cinematography is beautiful and the story is classically good. The idea of the ""one eyed jack"" is that of the duality of humankind. The face you show and the one that is hidden.

Even so, with Ben Johnson, Carl Malden, and Marlon Brando, Jacks is one of the best movies of its day. Brando is still young enough to play the romantic lead convincingly, Malden is both vile and believable, and Ben Johnson is a wildcard opportunist of the lowest kind.

Well, surprise, surprise, when the DVD Copywright Warnings come on, they're in German!. Then the Main Menu comes on and you have to go to Set-UP and select English, or the default track you'll hear is in the German Language! Then the movie comes on and there's a scratch running down screen right during the Paramount Studio Logo and the VistaVision logo is completely missing! Then for the clincher: the Main Title Sequence and all Establishing Titles during the flik are in - French!

The print itself is sharp, but that's about its only virtue. The color is quite pale and the dark scenes are milky. I had a one-dollar bargain DVD that I purchased at Wal-Mart 6 years ago that, though not anamorphic, was Widescreen Letterboxed, and it was a mouthwatering Technicolor print, probably struck from the Laserdisc version. Unfortunately, I threw it away when I ordered this blu-ray rip-off.

There's NO indication anywhere in the packaging that this is an cheap Import, nor that is is NOT an official Studio release. So, buyers, STAY AWAY from this! It is a total GYP! Let's hope Paramount does this masterpiece justice in the not too distant future. Olive Films, are you reading me? H-E-E-E-E-E-LP!",1344729600,,1367,4.913419913419913

Karl Malden should have won an Oscar and Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens shine in supporting roles. A very rewarding viewing experience. And I just finished watching it now.

Bad Blue-Ray? Full Frame? Sick and tired of this film looking like crap. Feel like Ben Johnson complaining, "" Get that stinkin' fish outta here.""?

The dvd I just watched was the DIGIVIEW slim case version, the one with Brando's face in the top corner, with below him Malden and Pellicer and then a group of 5 ruales. It was wide-screened with exceptional color and sound. You'd really have to be nit-picking to hate this version. I enjoyed it very much and can recommend it to all. At least give it a try. You've got little to lose as it's readily available from many Amazon sellers for almost next to nothing.

294148,3,6300215881,"Guys,
I,m not wanting to start an argument here,but I have to say,lets get a wee bit realistic here in the reviews of One Eyed Jacks blu-ray.
First of,aye,the blu-ray picture quality of OEJ leaves a LOT to be desired,and that,s me being kind,it is terrible for a blu-ray to have this kind of ""picture quality""???? but that,s comparing it to other blu-rays!!!!!
Now,I was very lucky to purchase a reasonably good PQ,widescreen,dvd of OEJ in a sale bin in Orlando,2002,for $5,and I was delighted,because,every other dvd I had seen was,quite frankly,CRAP,even the tv showings left a lot to be desired,so,when I found out it was being released on blu-ray I had great ""hopes"",sadly this wasn,t to be,the blu-ray PQ was definitely sub-standard,HOWEVER,it,s a huge jump in PQ compared to the truly CRAP dvd,s we,ve had to put up with for all those years,and that,s how I,m ""judging"" OEJ,Blu-ray compared to DVD,and this blu-ray is a definite winner in that comparison.
I totally agree with one of the previous reviewers,One Eyed Jacks is definitely not going to get the same blu-ray treatment as some of the ""new stuff"",and it,s obvious that the print they,ve taken this transfer from is very dodgy,to say the least,so,lets be thankful that,for as bad as the PQ is,it,s much better PQ than the terrible dvd,s we,ve had to put up with.
Lastly,I,m old enough to remember seeing this first time around at the Cinema,it,s a great shame that this very undervalued,underrated western is receiving,well lets be frank,no treatment whatsoever!!!!!!!
I had a wry smile at the end of One Eyed Jacks blu-ray,thinking,OEJ was made in Vistavision,so was The Searchers!!!!
that,s where the blu-ray PQ comparison ends,so I aint disagreeing with the other reviews,I,m just asking for the blu-ray to be compared to the dvd,by the way,I bought my OEJ from amazon germany,it  cost me just over $10,including p&p,so,a better than dvd PQ of OEJ for $10-12,I can go with that.

294186,3,6300215881,"...waiting for a better Blu-ray or other disc version of this terrific western. The distributors/studios are rapidly losing interest in providing top quality Blu-rays of many if not most of the bigger hits, even the classics, of 50 or 60 years ago. Putting time and money into a top quality Blu-ray of a lesser 50-year old box-office draw (albeit a really fine one) like One-Eyed Jacks is way, way down on their to-do list. In fact, it isn't even on the last page of the scratch pad. They've got 3-D cartoons and comic book super-hero Blu-rays to tend to, ya' know.  Look at the shoddy work they allowed to pass into distribution of the recent West Side Story and My Fair Lady Blu-rays. Inexplicable fade-ins/fade-outs here, loss of detail on the sides of the screen there. Do you honestly think they're going to put more work into a better Blu-ray of something most of the 20-somethings sitting in on quality control never heard of called One-Eyed Jacks?

That said, the fact that this version of it is finally anamorphic widescreen and provides a bit more detail and sharpness than those bargain bin give-aways makes it worth a buy, imo. So I gave it three stars. If your player's remote has an ""audio"" button, that's probably the best way to select the English vs the German language. Maybe the only way, I couldn't tell.

In the face of distributors/studios looking forward to making more money on the first day's take for the Blu-ray release of Transformers 10 in 3-D than all the sales of a perfect Blu-ray of One-Eyed Jacks over the next 100 years combined, I wouldn't expect to intimidate them into producing that perfect one just because you returned this release of it to the vendor along with a surly note.

btw, Amazon says the disc includes original poster art. Well, it does. But the shots of those posters are mixed in with and comprise much of that odd trailer. They aren't a separate bonus chapter or anything like that.",1321488000,,1937,4.671554252199414
294187,3,6300215881,"I just watched the blu-ray version I received from Amazon. First of all, the case was not sealed, indicating it had been opened. A return? Second, it was skipping a lot, so I took it out and cleaned it with a wet tissue. It ran OK after that.

I have two other non blu-ray versions of this film,including one advertised as the best transfer, and this one is the best in picture sharpness, though the color is a bit washed out and the soundtrack is mediocre. It is also full screen. The musical soundtrack of this movie is one of the best, most romantic of all westerns, and it's unfortunate the sound is not better.

This is a great movie--one of Brando's many great roles. In his prime, and with all his girlfriends playing small parts (count them). He said the girls were the only thing he remembered about the movie. He and his leading lady, Pina Pellicer, have great chemistry, and their love scenes are very moving--complemented beautifully by Friedhofer's great music. Friedhofer, by the way, did the orchestrations for the music in ""Casablanca.""

I think I reviewed this movie previously in one of the non blu-ray versions, so I won't repeat myself. I'm satisfied with this blu ray version because the picture is sharp and full screen. Both important because of the exquisite views and photography of the Monterrey coast. Seeing this film again, I was also struck by the superb acting performances of the supporting cast beyond Brando--Malden,Johnson, Pickens, Pellicer, Jurado et al. Perhaps influenced by Brando's directing. Malden, by the way, received star billing with his friend Brando in the screen credits--and deserved it.",1321401600,,1638,4.884892086330935
294188,4,6300215881,"The Amazon editorial review stating ""Pain-staking re-mastering and re-colorized"" is a stretch. And I suppose they meant Painstakingly re-mastered and re-colorized. When I first viewed this BD I thought I was watching a colorized version of a 50's Audie Murphy western. The picture had exceptionally low color and contrast levels like I've never seen on a blu-ray. I tweeked my Panasonic 50-inch Plasma TV picture settings, +30 for added contrast, Color +8, Tint -8 (toward red), Brightness -2, and Sharpness +17. You can also select Vivid if that's available on your TV.

With the picture adjustments made, no DVD can compare with the OEJ blu-ray. You will be disappointed initially on seeing the shivering credits roll past a gray brick wall along with some artifacts. Minutes later, in the first bank robbery scene, Brando is sitting atop the bank counter - in pathetic VHS quality. Somehow these opening frames were not upgraded. From then on, the picture is improved as can be seen from the details in  the clothing, horses, and saddles. It's not perfect but is probably close to 1080p in resolution.

Throughout the film there's a slight, grainy quality to the picture especially in some of the low light scenes. Also I found a voice sync problem noticeable in the beach scenes with Rio and Louisa. They could have done a much better job with this blu-ray but for 13 bucks, I'll keep it.

What makes this western so good is the emotional intensity of Brando, whether humorously conning a woman, ""My mother gave me this before she died"", or in a vicious fit of anger ""Get up, you scum sucking pig. I'm gonna open you up."" Karl Malden as the treacherous Dad Longworth and Ben Johnson as outlaw Bob Amory provide strong supporting performances as do the rest of the cast.

Odd things about this BD: The opening copyright details are in German. The credit titles are in French. You can select German or English for the audio but after the movie plays, I had to restart the disc to change the language. The trailer appears to be a combination of stop-action scenes from the movie and part of the original trailer. No special features. Four stars because I like the movie despite the disappointing blu-ray effort.",1321401600,,2212,4.810526315789474

294225,3,6300215881,"I know I might stir the pot with this review. However, I own three different versions of this movie so I do have basis of comparison. The Brentwood version was the best I owned picture wise on DVD. While not the best it was watchable compared to Digiview version I owned as well, which was pretty unwatchable. So after of all negative reviews I have read I was all set to send my Blu-Ray copy back that I had originally pre-ordered with excitement since I love this movie as much as you guys. I decided to look at the Blu-Ray myself just before sending it back. So here is my review of the One Eyed Jacks Blu-Ray and I will try to be objective and fair. First, I put the Blu-Ray in my Samsung player and I had the issues everyone else had trying to get past the copyright warning screen. Once I figured out that pressing the pop up menu button would bring up the main menu everything was ok. I had to change the language to English since the default was German, which was pretty easy to do. The opening credits were in German which might bother some, but it didn't really bother me.  Now the part everyone cares about the picture and audio quality. If you were comparing this to a transfer of The Searchers well of course The Searchers would win hands down in comparison. I used The Searchers as an example since both are Vista Vision prints. The Searchers has had major restoration work done so of course it's going to look better. However, compared to other versions of One Eyed Jacks I own on DVD this Blu-Ray is by far the best version available. It looks pretty decent on my Samsung 52in 120hz HDTV is it the version we all want? No, but it's by far the best version out there IMHO until Paramount or a major studio undertakes the needed restoration for this film. The colors could be better but a small color adjustment on my T.V. helped quite a bit. Overall, and like I said before I am fairly happy with this Blu-Ray of One Eyed Jacks and consider it a decent upgrade until a studio like Paramount spends the money to restore the original negative. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helps someone who is on the fence and not sure of which way to go.  Bob",1321315200,,2187,4.292978208232445

The main advantage this Blu-ray disc has over the LD is the video formatting to accommodate wide screen TVs.

Considering the price, perhaps this release will serve as a stop-gap measure until some outfit with more money and tech. capabilities releases a properly restored version of this last VistaVision film. This film begs for extra features considering all the difficulties incurred with the production.

The titles and other info. scripts on this release are in French and there are no sub-titles on the disc. The audio track includes a German dubbed version.

294268,5,6300215881,"I watched the VHS version of this movie years ago, and have recently bought two DVD versions on Amazon--the Brentwood/BCI Eclipse here and the Digiview version. I have a wide screen TV with a high quality blu-ray player which is supposed to raise the resolution of regular DVDs to HD.

I've watched both DVDs, and clearly the Brentwood is the better print. Significantly sharper and true to color considering the age of the movie (1961).Both are wide screen, with perhaps an inch or so of black around the borders. The Digiview is slightly blurry--it says ""made in China"", which tells you something. The Brentwood is darn good, but watch for the blu-ray version which comes out in November. Perhaps the blu-ray will be off the master, instead of the laser disc, as these older DVDs are.

Now,to the movie. I believe Rio is one of Brando's best, most creative roles, along with Stanley in ""Streetcar"", Terry in ""Waterfront"" and the Godfather in ""Godfather"".The guy is an absolute stud at this stage of his career--with a face like a Greek god. A real presence on the screen. As is his talent for creating a character, renowned from his acting school days. He covers his usual great range of emotions with flawless dynamics and timing--from some of the most tender, sensitive love scenes he's ever done with Luisa (played beautifully by Pina Pellicer, at his direction), to the raging bull with his fellow outlaws. The film is aided by an exceptional cast featuring Karl Malden in one of his best roles as the bad guy,Dad,who deserts his friend,Rio(he and Marlon were the best of friends for 50 years in real life), and also Ben Johnson, Katy Jurado and a host of excellent character actors. The cinematography is breathtaking, with the backdrop of the Pacific ocean in on-location scenes. And then there's the musical score--one of best, most romantic in all films--by Hugo Friedhofer. Friedhofer, by the way, also did the orchestrations for the classic movie ""Casablanca.""

""One-Eyed Jacks"" has become a cult film. It is said to bridge the old style 50s westerns with the new-style anti-hero spaghetti westerns of the 60s and later. It is apparently Martin Scorcese's favorite Western--which is enough to gain it some notoriety. It grows on you. You watch it a few times, and the performances start to sharpen, the scenery becomes more breathtaking, and the music starts to move you--especially in the tender romantic scenes between Rio and Luisa. Brando had that feminine, vulnerable side to him that all the great ones have, and it shows up in these scenes. Was he,too,revealing his other ""Eye"" when he came clean with Luisa about the jewelry?

It is said that Brando's direction resulted in a 4+ hour film which had to be cut by editors to the final 141 minutes. That's a lot of cutting. Brando's ending had Luisa killed in the last shootout by Dad's last shot. In fact, you can see her slumped over a bit on her horse as she rides out of town with Rio. The next scene, which was reshot later after the ending change, shows her riding more upright on her horse. Malden said Brando's original ending was better--it would have heightened the power and irony of the film. But 4+ hours? No. The editors did a good job,in my view, with the cutting, regardless of which ending. It's still a great film--Luisa dead or alive.

A word about Brando's view of the film: he said years later all he remembered was all the women in the movie he made love to off the set while filming. You can count the possibilities--about seven beauties! Including Katy Jurado, an old flame, and Pina Pellicer, who received  a memorable introduction to method acting by Brando which surely aided her performance.",1315353600,,3686,4.787735849056604

294272,3,6300215881,"This edition of ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" by Echo-Bridge Entertainment, appears in general video quality pretty much identical, if not entirely identical, to the edition released by Brentwood Home Video ""Exclusively Distributed by BCI Eclipse LLC"" as part of a four-video collection entitled ""Legends of the West."" One difference is that this Echo-Bridge edition gives more vidoo chapter options but also, unforgiveably, starts the movie a few notes into Friedhoffer's magnifican musical score, which is a bit like starting Beethoven's Fifth Symphony a few notes in.  There is some color washout in a scene early on with Brando, Malden,etc.ins ide the bank, but otherwise, except for video purists, it is certainly much better than not having this masteriece at all.  If you can find the ""Legends of the West"" collection (which also includes ""The Sundowners"", set in Australia, with Robert Mitchum; ""The Big Trees,"" with Kirk Douglas; and ""Vengeance Valley,"" with Burt Lancast, if things like cutting off the first notes of a magnificanet score drive you nuts, you'd be better off with the ""Legends of the West"" collection if you find it.  Surely ""One-Eyed Jacks"" deserves a restoration and since it is reportedly Martin Scorsese's favorite western, perhaps one day he might shell out the fortune to restore this classic.  However, other than annoyingly cutting off the first notes of the score, this appears to contain the movie though with the aforementioned color washout in the bank scene.  It is a truly magnificent movie with awesome performances by Brandon, Malden, Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens, Karty Jurado, Pina Pellecer, and all the rest.  If you like Brando in this, be sure to look him up in ""The Appaloosa,"" which, to my knowledge, is the only other western featuring him as the protagonist.  (He is a villain in ""The Missouri Breaks"" with Jack Nicholson as the ptortagonist.)  For Karl Malden doing another great villain perfromance in a western, don't miss ""Nevada Smith"" with Steve McQueen, Brian Keith, Martin Landau as a heavy, and Susanne Pleshette.",1299196800,,2058,5.177710843373494
294273,4,6300215881,"I have always considered this film one of Marlon Brando's best, possibly because I love a well-written Western, the likes of which are far and few between now; and is the main reason why I revisited this one after all these years.  It is worth the revisit.

The story line, as in many before it, begins with the classic double-cross.  Partners in crime, an older outlaw, (Karl Maldin) and a younger one (Brando) rob what will be their last bank together and in the ensuing chase, are brought down on a hill when one of the horses is shot out from under them.  The posse swarming below, Brando stays to defend himself while Maldin takes the sound horse and makes good his escape, and the double-cross has begun handsomely.

After Brando escapes from prison and aided by another escapee, he plots revenge and sets out to track Maldin down.  He doggedly searches the ""honkey tonks and bars"", finds word of Maldin and ultimately locates Maldin himself, resplendent in political security as a powerful figurehead in a magnificent little Coastal town, married to a fading Spanish beauty, Katy Jurado, and very successfully practicing a charade as a family man. He doesn't need to see his old abused partner hover on the horizon after all this time, but there he is and he needs to deal with him.  As they size each other up again, in magnificent hypocritical ""glad to see you"" jousting, they both start forming their opposing plans.

Pina Pellicer turned in what I felt was an absolutely superb performance in her part as Karl Malden's untouched, honest and genteel step daughter - in fact, she developed her role far beyond what it actually was designed to do. This girl, while of no great beauty, had the potential to be a character actress extraordinaire, which unfortunately was never fulfilled in her own life. Katy Jurado, in the supporting role, is quiet in ""carefully cultivated elegance"" belying her past - as the still-beautiful, world wise and anxious mother of Pina, a mother who recognizes all the signs and symptoms as her daughter begins to fall for the handsome desperado she knows nothing about but suspects the worst - because she herself has been there twenty years before.

The photography alone is worth watching the film. And Karl Maldin is undoubtedly one of the elite character actors of his time; a guy who can make a villain come to life right before your eyes.",1295136000,,2381,4.759708737864078

Pursuers arrive in town and search local bordello. One man makes a daring mistake, and warns the other. They are chased and surrounded. Dan will ride to find fresh horses and return.

Dan tells a story about his failure to return; Rio knows the truth. Rio tells a story too.

There will be a fiesta tomorrow, everything will be closed. Rio makes his plans about the bank. The sheriff advises them to leave town afterwards. Rio walks with Louisa. The people have fun. Rio tells a story to Louisa, and gives her a necklace. [Didn't her mother warn her?] The next morning he tells her the truth. [Isn't that out of character?] The Deputy talks to Dan about Louisa and Rio. There is drama here. There is conflict in the tavern but it is ironed out. The sheriff shows up. ""He was asking for it."" Rio is arrested and whipped. He is put on a horse and driven out of town. They rest at a small ranch far out of town. Rio heals over time, and practices shooting his pistol. Louisa rides out to visit Rio. [Does Rio talk too much?] There is conflict among the four robbers. [Boredom?] Three men ride off, but one falls from his horse.

There is a bank holdup by two men. One robber is shot, so is the teller and a young girl. The other robber escaped. The Deputy tells the sheriff, who was not in town. Rio is captured and brought into town, an angry mob greets him. [Rio is short on luck.] Rio will get a fair trial and them be hanged. Louisa visits Rio in jail. Will this change things? Yes, and there is more action and drama. Will there be a happy ending for Louisa and Rio? [Not likely.]

Some have compared it to the great westerns such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Wayne-Stagecoach-Tin-Sign-12-5W-x-16-H/dp/B0012Q4CH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Wayne - Stagecoach Tin Sign 12.5W x 16""H</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shane/dp/0792163710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shane</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unforgiven-Blu-ray/dp/B000JLPMPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unforgiven [Blu-ray</a>]. I'm not sure it is in that category, but it's a very good western.

Originally Rod Serling wrote a screen play, but he was replaced by Sam Peckinpah and Stanley Kubrick was hired to direct. Brando didn't like ever one of them; fired both and took over writing and directing himself. He delivered a ponderous 5 hour film to the studio and walked away. Probably Archie Marshek who edited this into the theatrical release of just over two hours should be given more credit. The other 3 hours of film were, it seems, destroyed at some point.

I can't recommend this version if you happen to see it, although it seems to me it contains at least a few minutes of film I haven't seen on other versions. Maybe some day someone will make a Blu Ray copy of the original. I know a good version exists because I saw it on TV just a few years ago and it was gorgeous.",1271289600,,1762,5.875

role to a tee! Of course Brando is Brando-top acting! Can't go wrong with this flick.",1270166400,,211,4.888888888888889
294321,5,6300215881,"I love this film, even though it might not deserve all the 5 stars I have given it. The DVD versions are (so far, up to Spring 2010) really poor transfers. Plus, it is not a movie for all tastes, because it was one of the first attempts to bring moral ambiguity, and psychological drama, to the western genre.

The film works extremely well on two levels, but is weak in another. The central plot is that Malden betrays Brando when they were both bank robbers. Malden uses the stolen money to ""go straight,"" while Brando goes to prison. The clash between Brando and Malden, once Brando is out of prison, is tensely done and expertly acted. We might sympathize somewhat with Brando's character, because he is hot headed, passionate and vulnerable; but we know he is still a criminal. Despite being sheriff of Monterey, Malden's character has not changed at all. He still has a criminal mind but now wears the badge of legitimacy. There are no pure men (the women are flawed too) in this film. Their consistently wicked behavior, compared to the beautiful Monterey Peninsula setting, makes us wonder about the goodness of the human heart. This is the philosophical heart of the film and was striking even on my first viewing. The weakness of the film is the ending. It feels phony. In fact, the legend is that the ending was changed, on orders from the studio, to make it happy. I say, So What? Red River had a phony ending and it is one of the absolute classic westerns.

The fine acting by the two co-stars is alone worth viewing this film. Add the beautiful cinematography and we have a slightly flawed yet ground breaking western. The acting is excellent. How could it be otherwise? We have here Karl Malden, Slim Pickens, and Ben Johnson. Three of the most solid actors of their generation, in addition to Marlon Brando. Watch this film and be prepared for a surprise -- Brando could direct as well as act!

WARNING: Do not buy a DVD of this movie. All are poor in quality, because the film is now in the public domain. Even some of the VHS releases are poor. However, excellent VHS versions are available (look for editions released under the Paramount label). If you have a laserdisc player, try to find the widescreen version.

294376,5,6300215881,"In an era during which the western movie was simply tuckered-out - tired of endless TV series' that chanted the same worn diatribe - and audiences searched for and demanded something different - along came ""One-Eyed Jacks""...featuring one listless, troubled, mumbling loner - fretting, ruminating, and deliberating...see, you actually can describe him with something other than ""brooding""!  No one besides Marlon Brando, as Rio, could have portrayed this man of few words - with tender, endearing lines, like - ""You get up - you big tub o'guts!"", ""Get up, you scum-sucking pig!"", and - ""You gob of spit!""  Along with an equally colorful actor - Karl Malden, as the dispicable ""Dad"" Longworth, there is a relationship between these two men seared in the fires of deep, infesting hatred and forged in revenge.

In a friendship marred by bitter betrayal and hyprocrisy, two former tequila-saturated, bank-robbing buddies finally separate when surrounded by Mexican troops.  But, when his mentor, Longworth, fails to come back to rescue him - having been dispatched to locate horses for their getaway and leaves him for capture and a long prison term, Rio just wants to settle the score.  He soon learns that his former buddy is now Sheriff ""Dad"" Longworth in Monterey, California - which just happens to be the location of the next bank that Rio and his new compadres are about to rob - the stage for sweet revenge.

With the fragile and lovely Pina Pellicer as Rio's love interest, Louisa, the solid Katy Jurado as her mother, Mrs. Longworth, and great character actors like Ben Johnson, Sam Gilman, and Larry Duran as Rio's new bank-robbing friends - along with Slim Pickens as the reprehensible Deputy Lon Dedrick and including notable appearances by Elisha Cook, Jr., Ray Teal, and the amazing Timothy Carey - the supporting stock in this picture elevates it to cult classic status.  Now, add the haunting and memorable score by Hugo Friedhofer - and you have a truly wonderful motion picture that deserves the careful and diligent restorative techniques of a powerhouse like - say Criterion - to remaster it completely.

Filmed chiefly against the backdrop of Monterey, California with its rockbound shores and crashing sea rollers - it was a refreshing change to see a location other than some wind-swept, border town surrounded by paper-mache saguaro cacti.  What makes this film different is the carefully designed, chess-like series of ploys as Rio and ""Dad"" Longworth position themselves for the inevitable showdown.  SPOILER ALERT:  And, when Longworth finally gets his, it is satisfying to say the least, but certainly short of the real ""Sonny Corleone""/""Clyde Barrow""-style, bullet-riddled dessert that he really deserves - even if Rio is carrying a nine-shooter revolver!

UPDATE: To its credit, Criterion (as mentioned above), has taken on the task of releasing this classic - fully-restored in Blu-Ray widescreen on November 22, 2016.",1266105600,,2947,5.155136268343815

I was especially moved by Pina Pellicer in her role as Louisa, who falls in love with Rio and becomes pregnant with his child. I also liked the unresolved ending, with Brando leaving her with the promise that he would return in the Spring when she would have her baby.

294384,5,6300215881,"This is one of the best western's ever made. When OEJ was released it was bashed by critics everywhere. If the film seems a bit cut up,that's because Brando's director's cut as submitted to universal was 4hrs and 30 minutes long. Universal studio editors took Brand's film and cut it to peices. Even cut up and incomplete OEJ stands a Brando's expensive,slowly made,masterpiece,loved by avid western fans,hated by studio execs because of it's price tag,and because the visual perfection and awesome cast of the film,along with the the excellant script,cinematogrophy,and a underplayed but riveting performance by Brando.. resented  if not doomed by the boys in the front office,who considered it excessive and over the top for a first time director. Critics were viscious,attacking OEJ as a pretensious,flop. That was in 1960.
  Forget that Kubrick was originally hired to direct the film,as well as Elvis to play the Rio Kid. Kubrick dropped OEJ because of script issues,Elvis dropped OEJ because The Rio Kid was a little too provocative for him. Enter Brando..he was willing to direct and star in OEJ.The OEJ project geared up again,Brando brought in some of his buddies,Karl Malden,Slim Pickens,Ben Johnson,Wally Cox and Katy Jurado,to play the various characters found in the rather long story of revenge..next Brando built an exact replica of Monterey city circa 1880. The Monterey set was expensive to build. It set the stage for over-budget spending that plagued the project from day one. Then shooting began,it continued at a turtle's pace. Brando the perfectionist came out,he re-shot scenes up to 20 times,which drew heavily on the already strained budget. The movie industry waited with attentive curiosity. Brando completed the film in August 1959. He edited most of the film himself. The final director's cut was 4hr 23minutes long. Studio Execs called it too long and demanded it be cut to about 2 hours,Brando refused any further editing changes to OEJ saying it was perfect and any changes would change the continuity of the film. The final cut put OEJ at 2hr and 20 minutes. The story line was altered into fragments of the original. It's modified slow pace made the film seem long and often boring. OEJ was the biggest bomb of 1960. The cast,thinking they were working on a classic,were bitter toward the Universal execs who had Brando's Western edited with such relish,the film was at times not recognizable even to some members of the cast.
 Actually,OEJ is a great Western,one of the best ever made. How can this be,in 1960 it was a miserable failure?When the word got out that Brando was going to direct a western for universal studios,and it would have a great cast,large budget,and the best technical personnel in the business working behind the scenes,everyone.. execs,reporters,and the public in general awaited the release of OEJ to hopefully see the film and Brando fail. It was released and it failed many of the attacks on the film were based on jealousy for Brando. Brando was a revolutionary actor who redefined acting,in doing so,he had rocked lots of boats. OEJ was the visual proof of""what goes around comes around"".The critics of the day hated the film not because OEJ was a bad film so much as it was a chance to bash Brando. His talent urked the best of them.
 Roger Ebert called OEJ""certainly one of the best of the genre,with perghaps one of the best scripts ever in action cinema"".
  Even edited to death,Brando had made a great film. Today it stands as a film ahead of its time.""Every frame is created by a master director who learned much from the great directors of his day""
  OEJ has one of the best casts ever assembled in cinema. The cinematography is the best,the script is better than the best and Brando gives one of his finest,most complex performances as the Rio Kid.",1233014400,,3819,4.93613707165109

DVD INFO: Since ""One-Eyed Jacks"" is public domain it has been released by numerous dvd companies with varying levels of quality. One version I saw was so bad it was unwatchable, but I can highly recommend two: Digiviw (which is available for a buck at Wal-Mart) and Platinum Disc Corporation (or PDC Home Entertainment). Both of these versions are WIDESCREEN (despite the fact that the Digiview version erroneously says on the back cover that it's full frame) and the picture quality is very good. So don't let the fact that these versions are usually sold for a buck fool you; these are quality dvds worthy of your video library. Other reviewers here at Amazon testify that the Front Row version is very good as well.

THE STORY: Dad Longworth (Malden) literally ""takes the money and runs"" as he leaves his young partner in crime, Kid Rio (Brando), behind to rot in a Mexican prison. Rio escapes 5 years later with only vengeance on his mind. He finds Dad in Monterey, California, now a respectable town Sheriff with a Mexican wife (Jurado) and step-daughter Louisa (Pina), living the American Dream on the beautiful Pacific coast. The situation is complicated by Rio's teaming up with two lowlife criminals whose only intent is to rob the Monterey bank, as well as Rio's romantic dallyings with Louisa.

""One-Eyed Jacks"" was Brando's only stab at directing and his original cut of the film was twice as long (!). I would love to see this director's cut, which HAS been shown on TV, but this 141-minute cut is fine as is.

Not only is ""One-Eyed Jacks"" one of the best Westerns of all time, it's also one of Brando's top films, along with ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1962), ""The Young Lions"" and the underrated ""The Missouri Breaks,"" not to mention ""Apocalypse Now.""

What makes it so great? Numerous things. Brando is at his most captivating here, but the story is entrancing as well, even though it's much more of a slow drama than an action/adventure film. When it comes, however, the action is quick and realistic.

There are numerous themes running through the long story. One of the major ones is the clash of the misfit with conventional society. Since society is composed of a bunch of conformist misfits, the misfit must learn to conform if s/he wants to fit in and succeed. In other words, if you want to 'make it' in conventional society it's necessary to hide your problematic past & flaws and put on a front of respectability. Dad Longworth has figured this out and he's not about to allow Rio to ruin it for him. (I'm not saying I completely agree with this as I don't believe in being fake, just that it's one of the major themes of the story).

I would like to offer a word of defense for Dad Longworth here. Although it was wrong for him to take the money and leave Rio to be captured, one can't help but empathize with him and the reasons why he gave in to the temptation. If he went back for Rio there was a high risk of getting captured or killed. The safest and most promising route was the selfish route. The good thing is that Dad wisely took advantage of this opportunity and made a good life for himself in Monterey. He was obviously sick of his criminal lifestyle and wanted a real life, a real job and real family. He was getting on in years and knew that this may well be his final opportunity, so he took it.

The problem is that one's past always has a way of haunting us, which is another theme of the film; hence, Rio walks back into Dad's life 5 years later and his American dream is seriously threatened. Notice Dad's rage when he whips/beats Rio to an inch of his life; he's doing everything in his power to kill the ugly phantoms of his past, which is why he tries to get Rio hung on false charges later in the story.

Another theme is redemption and how love is tied to any such positive transformation. Both Dad and Rio are criminal scumbags, but both desire redemption and a better life. The love of Dad's wife and the Monterey general populace brings this out in Dad, whereas Louisa's love for Rio slowly changes him. Near the end we plainly see that Rio no longer wants to kill Dad, he doesn't even want to see him; all he wants is to run off with his lady love. If Rio remained the same person he was at the beginning of the story ""One-Eyed Jacks"" wouldn't be half the film it is.

In addition, Dad's love for Katie, his Mexican wife, is what delivered Katie and Louisa ""from the beanfields,"" as Dad puts it.

Love goes hand-in-hand with loyalty or faithfulness. We see this in Rio's likable Mexican sidekick, Chico (Larry Duran).

One of the best qualities of ""Jacks"" is that it's refreshingly realistic. There's no goofiness, unbelievable one-liners, over-the-top action or excruciatingly dated aspects.

Speaking of dated, although the opening credits sequence and score are dated and boring, the rest of the film isn't. So don't let this sequence cause you to tune out. The rest of the score (by Hugo Friedhofer) is great.

""One-Eyed Jacks"" was the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western. For instance, the protagonist is a dyed-in-the-wool ""cool"" anti-hero (like, say, Eastwood or Bronson). The main difference between ""Jacks"" and most Spaghetti Westerns, however, is that ""Jacks"" has a truly worthwhile story wherein numerous gems of wisdom can be gleaned, which can't be said about films like ""The Good, the Boring and the Ugly"" (don't get me wrong, I love the music and style of that film, it's just that the plodding story and scumbag characters leave much to be desired); also the anti-hero in ""One-Eyed Jacks"" slowly transforms into a potentially positive member of society.

The film's influence goes well beyond just the Spaghetti Westerns. Take, for instance, Brando's crucifixion-style beating and long restoration. The film ""Conan the Barbarian"" pretty much ripped-off this entire sequence; Arnold Schwarzenegger even admits to it.

Pina Pellicer does an outstanding job as Rio's girlfriend Louisa (Dad's step-daughter). Although she's definitely good-looking she's too skinny for my personal tastes. Spiritually-speaking, however, she's incredible. Although she commits a foolish error by sleeping with Rio after the festival (she probably had too much to drink -- another error), on a whole she's the epitome of love, virtue and spirituality. Again, this love is the key factor in Rio's positive metamorphosis.

Unfortunately Pina committed suicide three and a half years after ""Jacks"" was released. Thankfully we have this film to remember her beauty and virtue. She deserves to be honored.

""Jacks"" was filmed entirely in California with all the coastal sequences photographed on the Monterey Pennisula, including Pebble Beach. This is one of the only Westerns where you'll see the Pacific Ocean, and it's truly glorious! Other locations include Big Sur and Death Valley.

CONCLUSION: Don't miss out on ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" Brando's only directorial effort. It's truly one of the GREAT Westerns, as well as one of Brando's most captivating performances.

Hopefully they'll release the 5-hour ""Director's cut"" one day.",1215388800,,7285,4.831460674157303

One version I saw was so bad it was unwatchable, but I can highly recommend two: Digiviw (which is available for a buck at Wal-Mart) and Platinum Disc Corporation (or PDC Home Entertainment). Both of these versions are WIDESCREEN (despite the fact that the Digiview version erroneously says on the back cover that it's full frame) and the picture quality is very good. So don't let the fact that these versions are usually sold for a buck fool you; these are quality dvds worthy of your video library. Other reviewers here at Amazon testify that the Front Row version is very good as well.

THE STORY: Dad Longworth (Malden) literally ""takes the money and runs"" as he leaves his young partner in crime, Kid Rio (Brando), behind to rot in a Mexican prison. Rio escapes 5 years later with only vengeance on his mind. He finds Dad in Monterey, California, now a respectable town Sheriff with a Mexican wife (Jurado) and step-daughter Louisa (Pina), living the American Dream on the beautiful Pacific coast. The situation is complicated by Rio's teaming up with two lowlife criminals whose only intent is to rob the Monterey bank, as well as Rio's romantic dallyings with Louisa.

""One-Eyed Jacks"" was Brando's only stab at directing and his original cut of the film was twice as long (!). I would love to see this director's cut, which HAS been shown on TV, but this 141-minute cut is fine as is.

Not only is ""One-Eyed Jacks"" one of the best Westerns of all time, it's also one of Brando's top films, along with ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1962), ""The Young Lions"" and the underrated ""The Missouri Breaks,"" not to mention ""Apocalypse Now.""

What makes it so great? Numerous things. Brando is at his most captivating here, but the story is entrancing as well, even though it's much more of a slow drama than an action/adventure film. When it comes, however, the action is quick and realistic.

There are numerous themes running through the long story. One of the major ones is the clash of the misfit with conventional society. Since society is composed of a bunch of conformist misfits, the misfit must learn to conform if s/he wants to fit in and succeed. In other words, if you want to 'make it' in conventional society it's necessary to hide your problematic past & flaws and put on a front of respectability. Dad Longworth has figured this out and he's not about to allow Rio to ruin it for him. (I'm not saying I completely agree with this as I don't believe in being fake, just that it's one of the major themes of the story).

I would like to offer a word of defense for Dad Longworth here. Although it was wrong for him to take the money and leave Rio to be captured, one can't help but empathize with him and the reasons why he gave in to the temptation. If he went back for Rio there was a high risk of getting captured or killed. The safest and most promising route was the selfish route. The good thing is that Dad wisely took advantage of this opportunity and made a good life for himself in Monterey. He was obviously sick of his criminal lifestyle and wanted a real life, a real job and real family. He was getting on in years and knew that this may well be his final opportunity, so he took it.

The problem is that one's past always has a way of haunting us, which is another theme of the film; hence, Rio walks back into Dad's life 5 years later and his American dream is seriously threatened. Notice Dad's rage when he whips/beats Rio to an inch of his life; he's doing everything in his power to kill the ugly phantoms of his past, which is why he tries to get Rio hung on false charges later in the story.

Another theme is redemption and how love is tied to any such positive transformation. Both Dad and Rio are criminal scumbags, but both desire redemption and a better life. The love of Dad's wife and the Monterey general populace brings this out in Dad, whereas Louisa's love for Rio slowly changes him. Near the end we plainly see that Rio no longer wants to kill Dad, he doesn't even want to see him; all he wants is to run off with his lady love. If Rio remained the same person he was at the beginning of the story ""One-Eyed Jacks"" wouldn't be half the film it is.

In addition, Dad's love for Katie, his Mexican wife, is what delivered Katie and Louisa ""from the beanfields,"" as Dad puts it.

Love goes hand-in-hand with loyalty or faithfulness. We see this in Rio's likable Mexican sidekick, Chico (Larry Duran).

One of the best qualities of ""Jacks"" is that it's refreshingly realistic. There's no goofiness, unbelievable one-liners, over-the-top action or excruciatingly dated aspects.

Speaking of dated, although the opening credits sequence and score are dated and boring, the rest of the film isn't. So don't let this sequence cause you to tune out. The rest of the score (by Hugo Friedhofer) is great.

""One-Eyed Jacks"" was the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western. For instance, the protagonist is a dyed-in-the-wool ""cool"" anti-hero (like, say, Eastwood or Bronson). The main difference between ""Jacks"" and most Spaghetti Westerns, however, is that ""Jacks"" has a truly worthwhile story wherein numerous gems of wisdom can be gleaned, which can't be said about films like ""The Good, the Boring and the Ugly"" (don't get me wrong, I love the music and style of that film, it's just that the plodding story and scumbag characters leave much to be desired); also the anti-hero in ""One-Eyed Jacks"" slowly transforms into a potentially positive member of society.

The film's influence goes well beyond just the Spaghetti Westerns. Take, for instance, Brando's crucifixion-style beating and long restoration. The film ""Conan the Barbarian"" pretty much ripped-off this entire sequence; Arnold Schwarzenegger even admits to it.

Pina Pellicer does an outstanding job as Rio's girlfriend Louisa (Dad's step-daughter). Although she's definitely good-looking she's too skinny for my personal tastes. Spiritually-speaking, however, she's incredible. Although she commits a foolish error by sleeping with Rio after the festival (she probably had too much to drink -- another error), on a whole she's the epitome of love, virtue and spirituality. Again, this love is the key factor in Rio's positive metamorphosis.

Unfortunately Pina committed suicide three and a half years after ""Jacks"" was released. Thankfully we have this film to remember her beauty and virtue. She deserves to be honored.

""Jacks"" was filmed entirely in California with all the coastal sequences photographed on the Monterey Pennisula, including Pebble Beach. This is one of the only Westerns where you'll see the Pacific Ocean, and it's truly glorious! Other locations include Big Sur and Death Valley.

CONCLUSION: Don't miss out on ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" Brando's only directorial effort. It's truly one of the GREAT Westerns, as well as one of Brando's most captivating performances.

Hopefully they'll release the 5-hour ""Director's cut"" one day.",1215388800,,7285,4.831460674157303

294440,2,6300215881,"I watched this movie 20 years later after the original release (1961) at a small town. I'm lucky that I had a chance to watch it in the cinema then. Now I got three DVD versions, i.e. from Vina, Digiview and the last one from D3k. I bought the D3k release from Amazon Marketplace (used item with very good condition (as claimed by the seller) from gohastings (Hastings Entertainment) thru third party (I can't buy it directly) and contrarily I got the very bad DVD condition: I can't watch the movie from chapter 3 onward).

Many movie lovers know that this movie is excellent. Too many reviewers praised the acting of the stars, the story/script, the photography, and the music. So, I will not repeat it again here. Only one thing to be straighten. That's Kid Rio (Marlon Brando) was not released from the jail in Sonora, Mexico 5 years later. But he run away from the jail with his partner Chico Modesto (played by Larry Duran).

For the product of D3k, the correct running time is 141 minutes instead of 117 minutes as stated in the back cover of the DVD. The positive aspect of this product of D3k is that it has English and French subtitles. Other releases has no subtitles at all. Only D3k release complete with subtitles. Picture and sound is not so good, but it's still watchable. Despite the fact that it's in full screen (1.33:1), the picture format is actually in Pan & Scan; too bad transfer since the movie is originally in Panavision. So, widescreen is the best aspect ratio.

I hope that Paramount will release the DVD complete with the subtitles, including English subtitle. So many people waiting, hoping and wanting the official release of this box-office movie in DVD format by Paramount. It doesn't need to release the DVD on the 50 Years Anniversary in 2011!

The script is pretty good for a Western...the character Brando plays, Kid Rio, begins as a scoundral who plays really cheap tricks on the ladies, but eventually turns into someone with character.  Brando plays all of the nuances in his masterful way, and of course, he is in his physical prime here so he is quite amazing to watch.

The supporting cast is all first rate.  Karl Malden is appropriately venal, Slim Pickens is delightfully disgusting, Katy Jurado gives a terrific performance as Malden's wife, Ben Johnson is always good as a bad guy.  The one performance I found lacking was that of the young girl who plays the love interest.  I found it hard to believe that Rio would have turned his life around for such a lack luster little thing...just my personal opinion.

It is very long but we are now used to see films finish in under two hours so maybe I'm just conditioned to that length. It's definitely worth seeing...just make lots of popcorn.",1201737600,,1104,4.545454545454546

294498,4,6300215881,"The story behind ONE-EYED JACKS appears to have been almost as interesting as the plot which unfolds on the screen.  Rod ""The Twilight Zone"" Serling wrote a rejected treatment of the book this film was based on.  The original director attached to the project was none other than a young Stanley Kubrick.  Eventually, the star and director ended up being the same person -- Marlon Brando.  The film reunited him with co-star Karl Malden; the pair having had worked together before in the classic ON THE WATERFRONT.

So dark is this story, that even Slim Pickens is playing a manipulative bum with few redeeming characteristics.  ONE-EYED JACKS is basically a story of betrayal -- a topic it explores right from the film's opening set piece.  Trapped, and with only one person able to escape, Karl Malden's character promises to seek help quickly and return to save Marlon Brando from the law.  Instead he takes their stolen loot and makes a run for it.

Brando spends the next five years in prison because of this and most of that time he broods over his betrayal at the hands of a man he nicknamed ""Dad"".  No doubt the fact that Brando himself manipulated the game of chance which sent Malden off as the one to find  help ate away at him.  Once escaping prison, he quickly meets up with another band of outlaws.  But their plans of more bank heists are secondary.  Brando is more interested in revenge.  He quickly catches up with Malden, but instead of exacting his vengeance quickly, he picks a more protracted method.  Favoring to pretend there are no hard feelings, he bides his time in order to heighten his former partner's suffering.

It's almost wearying to watch this unfold.  Brando cheerfully proclaims that he bears no malice, but covertly plans his revenge.  Malden swears he trusts Brando, but has machinations of his own.  The audience must simply watch as these two men get deeper and deeper into their own games.

What's delicious about this movie is that you can connect a line between every individual character and each person they encounter.  And almost every single one of those lines draws a deceitful relationship.  Brando deceives Malden, Malden's daughter and every woman he meets.  Malden lies to Brando and his own family.  Malden's daughter hides the truth from her father.  Slim Pickens tries double crossing everyone he meets.  It's dizzying to keep up with what the actual reality of the film is.

As far as revenge films goes, this is good, but not great.  The vengeance is interesting to watch from the point of view of the audience, yet it's not quite as engaging as it could have been.  I felt simultaneously intrigued and removed from the action.

Where the film does get a boost though is from the performances of the two stars.  This shouldn't be a surprise.  Even in places where the script drags, watching Malden and Brando as they plot and scheme with each other while also trying to figure out the other guy's motivation is always fun.

The Digiview Productions edition of this film is presented in widescreen.  The picture and sound quality are more than adequate, although they could definitely benefit from some digital cleanup.

If you like movies where the only characters with redeeming qualities are given less than half a dozen lines each, then ONE EYED JACKS should be right up your alley.  But you might want to draw a flow-chart while watching so that you can keep track of everyone's ulterior motives.",1175040000,,3456,4.777027027027027
294499,4,6300215881,"I'm not a big fan of westerns, but this one is definitely worth the 2 hours and 20 minutes of dedication it takes to watch it. The story is constantly progressing and 45 years after it was made it's still an amazing and interesting story.

Marlon Brando (directing and starring) really nailed this one. His Kid Rio is brilliantly calm, with a dark side brewing just under the surface. Five years after being left to be caught by the Mexican law by his bank robber sidekick Dad Longfellow, Rio sets out to find Longfellow and exact his revenge.

What starts out as a revenge film turns into so much more as the characters are developed and the plot thickens. The scenery is beautiful: the kind of rolling desert hills and oceanfront shots you wish there were more of today. Also, Slim Pickens makes a great appearance as a deputy.

The DVD quality isn't that great. As we get more and more used to HD quality images, older films like this one may be harder to watch, as suddenly everything in them seems hopelessly fuzzy, but that has more to do with current DVDs than with the original movie itself. Overall, it's a great watch and worth checking out.",1174348800,,1151,4.524038461538462
294500,3,6300215881,"This movie about a trio of Mexican banitos, was directed by Marlon Brando who also starred as Rio Boy.  Where's the Cisco Kid when you need him?  In 1962, Marlon was a balding, unattractive Indian giver (he took the ring back), certainly not a gentleman.  He was captured in a sandstorm by a group of Amigos.  After he escaped, he went to the Fiesta where he talked with his mouth full (no manners).

The respected sheriff of the town had been his partner and taken off with two sacks of gold.  Now he is a corrupt politican married to a Mexican woman for respectabilty.  Louisa, the sheriff's step-daughter, is wooed and seduced by Rio and gets pregnant (a repeat of her heritage).  When he says how good that makes me feel, he doesn't look happy or glad.  He tells lies when dealing with women and men.  This time he buys a necklace for $30 and used it as he took advantage of Louisa.  He admits later that everything he told her was lies to get his way with her.  She became a disillusioned damaged goods which the old lecherous deputy tries to taunt and corrupt, but she has already been corrupted by Rio, the man she loves.

When caught, Rio is bull whipped in public by the sheriff in an exhibition as he crippled Rio's gun hand.  At the thrashing incoming tide, he thinks of Louisa as his body heals, but his psyche doesn't.  He is out for revenge.  His ""best friend"" had left him to die (his sad tale) and he gives three reasons for why he wants to kill the man: five years of life lost, stolen money, and the beating.  ""Will killing him make you a man?""  Louisa reminds him that there are not many chances in life to be happy.  One has to forget and forgive.  He'd been hurt too much and can't forget.

Love conquers all with Louisa on the white stallion as she goes  home to wait for his return.  He had a reason to do what he did, but it does not seem to matter now.  He was a hunted man and demented with the need for revenge.  Instead of hiding in Mexico, he rides off to Oregon.  One-eyed jack is one who pretends to be what he isn't.  He gets cornered and there is a shootout by the town fountain.  Vengeance is mine as the lovers ride away after the jail break.

294503,4,6300215881,"'One-Eyed Jacks' might be considered the most self-consciously Western of the sixties, and possibly of all time... It contains undoubted visual attributes, gorgeous photographic sequences of an immense sandy desert, and panoramas of the spectacular California coast... Not often does one get to see the sea in a Western... Another of the film's great assets is its beautiful music...

'One-Eyed Jacks' is slow, but very tough, realistic and softly romantic... The picture has excitement and violence...

Brando summons all the reserve of anger, inner ambivalence, and emotional complexity in his nature... As a cowboy, he is tough, cunning, soft-spoken, sentimental, vicious, and occasionally masochistic... He plumbs dark reserves of desolation and revenge with an inner ferocity that had always been a part of him but had never before emerged full-force... As a director, he is meticulous, with a keen eye for spectacular outdoor cinematography, and an instinctive sense for the visual expression of inner conflicts...

Karl Malden, whose surface friendliness and affability usually concealed either weakness or malice or both, is excellent as the ambitious, determined outlaw, and the volatile, treacherous, arrogant sheriff whose last poisonous spill: ""You'll get a fair trial, and then I'm gonna hang you, personally.'

'One-Eyed Jacks is largely a story of vengeance... The film begins with two American outlaws operating in Mexico... Rio (Brando), a happy-go-lucky man who considers himself a Don Juan, and Dad Longworth (Karl Malden), a crooked man looking for the opportunity to settle down...

They raid banks with real ease and spend their leisure time drinking and courting women... Rio appears as a somewhat cultured bandit with a weakness for aristocratic young ladies... He gives one of them his most ""precious"" possession, his mother's ring...

The Mexican police trail the pair and almost catch them at their lovemaking, but Rio and Dad fight their way out to the desert... The mounted police follow and the bandits are eventually trapped in the hills with one of their horses shot... Rio determines to stay... Dad promises to return with a fresh horse, but, tempted by two sacks of gold, he never come back...

Rio is captured and spends five years of his life in a brutal Mexican prison, until he makes an escape, with the company of a friend called Modesto (Larry Duran).

The embittered Rio is now a man bent on revenge... He learns in one Cantina that his ex-partner is the sheriff of a town called Monterey, and has taken himself a Mexican wife with a teen-age daughter... So he goes to visit him...

A guilt-ridden Dad finds Rio pleasant and apparently willing to forget past differences... He presents his family, and invites Rio to stay for supper...

Rio is in league with two bandits, Bob Amory (Ben Johnson) and Harvey Johnson (Sam Gilman), and they have come to Monterey to steal a bank... They grow impatient, but Rio assures them of his intention not only to rob the bank but to kill the sheriff as well...

Obviously, Longworth is not completely convinced about his friend, and becomes uneasy when Rio and his step-daughter show a romantic interest in one another... He well remembers Rio's past amorous adventures and he has no wish for anything that will delay Rio in Monterey...

The town engages in a fiesta, with the bank not planning to open for several days... While the respected sheriff joins the townspeople in their festivities, Rio seduces the tender Louisa...

The next morning, in a saloon, Rio approaches a drunk mistreating one of the house girls and knocks the man down... The drunk reaches for a shotgun and tries to shoot Rio in the back... But Modesto (as Bronson in 'Jubal') helps save Rio from the blast... The resultant outbursts Longworth to put his grisly double-cross into effect...

He takes Rio into the street and arrests him with the help of his deputies... He ties him to a horse rail, flogs him with a whip, smashes his right hand with a rifle butt, puts him on his horse and drives him out of town...

Rio retreats to a small fishing village on the coast with his partners and nurses himself back to health... Louisa visits him at his place to tell him she is in love... Rio's eyes are full of hate against her step father... He is entirely blind in his determination for revenge... Louisa wants him to forget, to leave his dark past for a brighter future... She leaves without mentioning she is expecting a baby...

For over a period of six weeks Rio practices with his gun in an intent to regain the use of his hand... Amory and Johnson grow impatient, and decide to make their own move... From here the action is carefully builds towards an explosion...

A carefully chosen supporting cast augmented the proceedings in fine style:

- Katy Jurado repeats her role of the loving and understanding mother...

- Ben Johnson plays the unscrupulous cowardly thief who avoids Brando's fury...

- The gentle Pina Pellicer does her earnest best to temper the intensities of her man...

- Slim Pickens plays the revolting deputy intimidated by an empty Derringer..

Brando's 'One-Eyed Jacks' comes on as taught and tight, acted with deep feeling and intense concentration... Brando and Malden play largely a stylistic battle...",1162857600,,5286,4.982954545454546
294504,4,6300215881,"Marlon Brando wrote and produced this western epic filmed on the California coast, most notably in Pebble Beach and Monterey before much of the current development.  Brando and his co-star, Carl Malden, are in their prime in this film about two bandits on the run from the law.  Rio (Brando) ends up getting caught and going to prison in Sonora.  Dad (Malden) escapes and betrays Rio.  He ultimately turns respectable and becomes the sherrif of a small town.  When Rio escapes from prison, he sets out for revenge.

Malden is particularly good in this film.  His homely intensity plays well against the Brando's concentrated sensuality.  The chemistry between the two men is mesmerizing.  Ultimately it is a tale of redemption, since Brando must leave his wicked ways in order to be worthy of a respectable woman's love.  This is a terrific western that is now classic but must have been very unusual for its time.",1156896000,,914,4.838709677419355
294505,5,6300215881,"Malden seems to start true, but then turns out to be living a lie. He gets his come-uppance in the end. Marlon tells one lie after another, but slowly appears to be reaching down to the deeper truth. He gets away with it in the end. The basic theme of this film seems to be the clash of the misfit with society --- perhaps this is the underlying theme of all films, since they are told from the point of view of the individual; and society is composed of nothing but a bunch of conformist misfits. If you want to succeed in society, you have to fake it --- cover up your miss-spent youth, or put it behind you,  don a front of respectability, hide your flaws. This is the way society operates, and two-faced old Dad has it figured out. Only show the acceptable side of your face, and you've got it made. One of the best things about this movie is that Brando managed to kick Kubrick the cube off the set. Many of Kubrick's films show the individual being flattened by society's values: and the individual is often shown as being demented or vicious beyond redemption in the first place. Instead of the heavy-handed Kubrick treatment, Brando gives us a sensitive, nuanced, moody, brooding, highly romantic, subtle and poetic story which perfectly fits the locale and the Mexican Western genre. Brando is great, as nearly always in his earlier work: 80% languor and 20% explosion. Malden, as always, is nothing less than 110% professional. To be beautiful, however, you have to suffer; and, boy, does Brando suffer. You have to ask yourself if he finished up working for the government in Oregon, leaving nothing but a little memento South of the Border. With five hours and a million feet of film in the can, you also have to ask yourself about possible alternative endings. For instance, did Malden get in a deadly shot from behind the fountain? Or did he shoot the girl in the back, and kill the baby, before the couple made their getaway? That would have been just too audience unfriendly in 1961.

I've now read pretty well most of the internet reviews of this movie, and the only one which halfway recognizes its power is the London Time Out piece by TM.

One of them decides to go for an additional horse but never returns: this is Jack (Eli Wallach) who besides escapes with two gold bags, the other is captured and confined in a prison in Sonora during five long years.
He can stand any longer and decides to escape with a partner; but there' s just an issue which has allowed him to bear all the jail's hell: his vengeance's thirst.
The exhaustive search leads him to Monterrey where his ex con has become (in an anticipated Kubrick vision' s Clockwork Orange) in the town's sheriff. Brando is not alone; he is accompanied by three gunfighters who have planned to steal the bank. So we have Jack as a distinguished law's ambassador with a clean service' page and happily married with a Mexican and her teenager daughter.
The script will be composed by an admirable web of  events that will make to hesitate the viewer; Who is the bad guy?; Is a sheriff 's badge the way to forget about it a twisted life just because you haven't seen them?; Does the law allow you to punish and humiliate a man under the mask of the suspicious?.
One of the most interesting surreptitious readings is: ""The redemption is not precisely, a concept in the values scale of an ex con.""

That being said about the film, let me just say that out of the seven to ten DVD versions available perhaps one or two are watchable. Why Paramount would not invest a little money into THE overlooked film of arguably our greatest American film actor is beyond me. Give the public a cleaned up print of this film and a little advertising based purely on Brando's reputation and they just might make some money off of it. As it stands the film will continue to be maligned and overlooked due to the atrocious DVD transfers that proliferate every video store and drugstore bargain bin. Good luck finding a good version.

The friendship of Brando and the Mexican he excapes with.

The revenge story.

The pyschoanalysis of Malden's character and what happens to someone who betrays, not just a one dimensional character.

The Slim Pickens vs. Brando subplot.

The whole Ben Johnson bank robbery aspect.

294630,4,6300215881,"So the word had come down from on high. The mandarins have spoken, and the outline of Brando's career has begun to take form. In brief, he was a flash in the pan: a handful of great roles in the early 50s followed by a lengthy decline marked by occasional triumphs ascribed mostly to the efforts of other people. Entire decades, e.g. the 60s, went past without a single role worth noticing.

 Much as I hate to contradict my betters, this is a load of crapola. A master's talent may ebb and flow, but it seldom fails completely. Brando made good films in every period of his career. In the 60s, supposedly his artistic Gobi, we can point to The Chase, Morituri, Burn!, and One Eyed Jacks.

 One Eyed Jacks is in many ways the most interesting of the lot. It's one of Brando's few Westerns, and the only film he directed. (Everyone knows the Kubrick story, which, I think, goes a long way to explain why the film has been dismissed.) One question that occurs to me is whether it was filmed from the Burst of Vermilion script that Truman Capote had such fun sneering at in his interview with Brando. But whatever the case, Jacks is no actor's film, it's a fully realized picture, a fine example of the gritty, adult Western that began appearing the 50s and reached its apotheosis in Peckipah's work a decade later.

 The acting is uniformly superb. Brando is at his best, a mercurial, Byronic figure as frightening as he is appealing. Brando excelled at playing rebels, and Rio ranks as such with Terry Malloy and Stanley Kowalski. Supporting roles are more than adequately filled by such Western regulars as Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens (Jacks is obviously the source of Terry Southern's great story about Picken's first meeting James Earl Jones, who wanted to know what it like working with Brando: ""Wayul, I worked with Bud Brando for six months, and he never done nothin' that weren't all man and all white."") Karl Malden's whipcracking performance will come as quite a surprise to those familiar only with his television persona. The only exception is the love interest, an anorexic little thing who, thankfully, is not onscreen for very long.

 Earlier reviews make it clear that the available versions vary widely in quality, to say the least. I saw it in this one, a dark, overexposed version with the focus more than iffy (that's why the rating is docked a notch). A pity, since the cinematography seems exceptional. One of these days, somebody will need to prepare a cleaned-up version so that we can make a fairer judgement of the thing. As it stands, Brando's eye appears to have matched his acting talents. It's a shame he didn't go on to direct others.

 The impulse to cut down the tall trees is perfectly understandable, which doesn't make it any less contemptible. It's a lot easier to sneer at an artist's eccentricities, weight problems, and severely dysfunctional offspring than to actually analyze the work, which could be open to error and might even put you in the firing line. But after all that is forgotten, the films and performances will remain. One Eyed Jacks will be prominent among them.",1090627200,,3130,4.705667276051188

 The Unicorn release is much better, very near typical DVD video quality. The picture on the case has only a close-up of a scowling Brando wearing a sombero with half of his face shaded (ala One Eyed Jack).

As much as I love Kubrick's work I don't think he could have done better.
  This film is so much more than a revenge/love story. Brando performance is outstanding. His complex charactor is as real as any performance on film. His wit, charm and rage are palpable. It deals with his inner turmoil as a man. Something that few films achieve or bother to deal with. The supporting actors are fantastic as well.

Martin Scorcese has described this as his favorite western. Rod Serling (""Twilight Zone"") worked on the first draft of the script, then Sam Peckinpah (""The Wild Bunch"") was hired to rewrite it. Stanley Kubrick was the director, but was later replaced by star Marlon Brando. This is Brando's first and only stint as a director, and though it isn't perfect, it's darn good. He does tend to let scenes drag on a little long, and there were some tedious parts that probably should have been left out, but I'd say about 75-80 percent of this film hits the mark.
As an actor, Brando dominates virtually every scene, drawing you in, making you feel what he's feeling. His character is a real son-of-a-b*tch, a liar and a scoundrel, but you come to empathize and root for him by the end. Pina Pellicer, who plays Rio's love interest Louisa, is a very fine actress who holds her own opposite Brando. She looks like a Mexican Audrey Hepburn. There really were no weak actors. Karl Malden, who played Longworth, is appropriately two-faced, a real ""one-eyed jack"".
The dialogue is very authentic. I've seen westerns where they talk like modern day folks, but in ""One-Eyed Jacks"" the dialect is pure 19th century outlaw. It's great to hear Brando call some guy a ""scum-sucking pig"" or a ""big tub of guts"".
I like westerns, and this is one of the best that I've seen. It's slow-paced, but it's so good that I didn't mind. It's very character-driven, which I like. It's great to see Brando in his prime. Released in 1961, this film had a significant influence on the revisionist westerns (Sergio Leone, etc.), which started around the mid-1960s. Thumbs up for ""One-Eyed Jacks""!

Brooding Brando is exceptional as is Madden's turncoat character; both men bent on revenging each other. I think this was the first film I saw using foreign language and Brando's clipped, slurred slang added to the gritty realism offset(somewhat to the detraction of the film) by the saccharine romance that develops between Brando and Maldon's daughter. The closeups of macho energy caught in the exchange of glances stirring between the lead two are captivating. And, and, this surely is a counter in the early 60s to what Hollywood was serving to avid western diets. The very languid pace heightens the brutality.
