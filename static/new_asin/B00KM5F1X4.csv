6433542,4,B00KM5F1X4,"A well shot, decent Austrian film about the futility of war seen through the eyes of a young Austrian(Moseley- Narnia movies) and his Italian love(Costantini).

With the 100 year anniversary of the start of WWI and planning a trip to Northeast Italy, this movie captured an instant interest for me since it takes place in the Dolomites, the mountains between Italy and Austria.  I had just watched 'My Boy Jack' starring Daniel Radcliffe(Harry Potter) in a WWI flick and the bonus feature about causes and motivations of that war that came with it; moreover, I saw a Rick Steves show on exploring the Dolomiti with the old fortifications and tunnels still in place that are evident in 'Silent Mountain'.

The movie begins with a 1915 wedding in still peaceful Austria with young love and hopeful prospects; however, we see traces of regionalism and potential for conflict as both Austrians and Italians celebrate together.  A child announces that Italy declares war against Austria, and things seem to change instantly as both sides, although neighbors and relatives, scamper to their respective countries so that they can begin attacking each other.

Moseley's character heads up the mountain with his platoon, knowing that his true love, an Italian, is left behind hiding out among the enemy.  The Italians are attempting to cross the mountains, one way or another, to defeat the outnumbered Austrians, all in the name of patriotism.  Who will survive?  And will the young lovers ever reunite?

It reminds me of 'Dresden'.  You know terrible things are going to happen, such is history, but you hope that somehow the heroes make it out alive.

The filming is beautiful with shots of the mountains looming up with craggy peaks, and a threat of their own.  The acting is good, done in English and Italian with subtitles.  Terrific Claudia Cardinale does a cameo.  The action scenes work well without being overly gory.  They're not filmed in grand panning shots, but are more focused in and allow the surrounding scenery to take the main role.  Indeed, the production company suffered from lightening strikes, mudslides and illness, including Moseley, who was sick for part of the film.

Like 'Dresden', although not as graphic, it shows the horror and craziness of war.  People turning either ugly or heroic, and lives lost for essentially nothing.  My wife kept saying, ""Why don't they turn against the idiots on top that ordered them to kill each other?""  Indeed.

A good film- depressing and stressful/suspensful with wonderful outdoor cinematography.  Again, fortunately, they limit the amount of blood and language with no nudity; although, there's plenty of violence and cruelty, they cut the camera away and focus more on the characters.  The actual battles between the Austrians and Italians were horrific with massive fatalities due to war and nature.",1408665600,46,2861,5.079229122055675

6433551,2,B00KM5F1X4,"This film gets the period setting right, but has almost no character development, aside from the one dimensional, maniacal Italian officer. The cinematography feels like someone's film school project, with myriad odd camera angles that do nothing to lessen the choppy feeling of the story.

6433564,5,B00KM5F1X4,"SILENT MOUNTAIN could easily take its place as a complement to such films as PATHS OF GLORY, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, & A TIME TO LOVE AND A TIME TO DIE.  Taking place at the beginning of WWI, SM revolves around a sidebar battle along the mountainous Alpine border between Italy and Austria.  The movie starts with a wedding between a Tyrolean and his Italian bride. The two families involved as well as their respective countries are at odds with each other to put it mildly.  Suddenly, in the midst of having a photo taken of the large wedding party, a young man barges in with the announcement that Italy has declared war on Austria.  Shades of the Goddess Discord disrupting an ancient wedding by tossing a golden apple, inscribed ""to the fairest"", into the midst of the throng that ultimately led to the Trojan War. Immediately, a rag tag group of Tyroleans of all ages is put together to fend off any expected attack from their Italian counterparts. The balance of the film then graphically shows the horror, desolation, wastefulness, and futility of warfare set against the background of a mountainous area that could just as well have existed on the lunar landscape; and in the end there are no real winners.  What we see in microcosm is the larger imagery that has lasted to this day regarding the trench warfare of WWI.  Death and despair, and the threat of firing on one's own troops to get them to charge forward to a guaranteed demise just to gain a parcel of land that no one would want in the first place is what is presented here to the viewer.  In the midst of all this, one individual - Andreas (brilliantly  portraited by William Mosely of RUN, NARNIA, & THE ROYALS fame) - stands out not only as a novice soldier but as one involved with a background love story. Earlier at the story's opening wedding, Andreas saw Francesca and it was almost love at first sight.  How those two work out their relationship amidst the mayhem all around them is a substantive story in its own right. All the characters in this film are complex, human, and fully fleshed out - a superb example of cinema verite.  The real tragedy of this film's story is the meaningless fray that the two sides are drawn into. If pressed hard enough, none would probably be able to give you a definitive reason for their conflict aside from the fact that they were ordered to do so. Such is too often the nature of war.  And, in the end, it is only the silent mountain(s) that bear witness to the wasteful agony and destruction that is the legacy of this localized deadly encounter.",1431302400,8,2573,4.535637149028077

6433567,4,B00KM5F1X4,I love this film. It was quite a disturbing take on a part of the war we never realise. It was great to see the truth of this region come to life in film. Excellent work.,1425168000,,170,3.75
6433568,4,B00KM5F1X4,"The movie is good. But I really loved the awesome scenery of the Dolomite Mountains and the depiction of the hard, rugged men defending their positions against the onslaught of overwhelming Italian forces (Italy waited for a year until Austria-Hungary was deemed sufficiently weakened from the heavy fighting on the eastern front before betraying and attacking its former ally Austria in 1915).
It's particularly the sergeants of the German Alpenkorps who exude the air of calm professionalism only found in true warriors. They reminded me of the tough Germans in the movies ""Cross of Iron"" and ""The Eagle Has Landed"" I used to watch with my dad when I was a kid.",1423699200,23,663,4.928571428571429

8659875,5,B00KM5F1X4,"Absolutely engaging portrayal in which the purity of young love is threatened not only by war, but also by the conflict caused when love crosses perceived lines of cultural and ethnic difference.
