5720551,5,B00CERJI5U,"I personally enjoyed this film just as much as the other 2 films.
The gags were great, the gore was plentiful and the acting was well executed. Adam Green is a Genius of him time. Danielle Harris is both beautiful and badass, and Kane Hodder is a F***ing God of men.
I am hoping for a 4th film.

5720552,4,B00CERJI5U,"It's the only hatchet movie I saw, but from trailers it seems to be the best chapter of Hatchet. I wish I had seen the rated version before seeing the unrated version of the movie. It was quite good, not a unique plot, but with a few predictable moments. Acting was not bad, just some of the people smiling when they shouldn't be doing it at all and people not always shooting and looking really easy to kill. Also the famous thing happens like in other movies.. something suddenly doesn't work. Suddenly it happens.. . What is it, made in China? I actually liked that many armed officers, deputies with guns went on search and rescue in 1 large group in the forest on the island. No splitting of the group, like it's always done to quickly kill everyone in the movie. The set was good, dark with a nice moon, looked really nice, except for the gore part which is just not what I like to see in the movies. Despite some negative and neutral things I mentioned, I was very entertained. I'd still would like to see the national guard making a fight, otherwise like in other movies, help comes when it's too late and everything is over. Not a bad movie. I actually wonder if there will be made the fourth part of the movie. I guess if it's done right it could be all right, but maybe this is the end. But is it always the end in other horror movies, when you kill and the beast gets resurrected for one reason or another? I could see a very bad movie coming out of this, but maybe this is the end or a better movie will be done. Who knows?",1375142400,,1536,4.227891156462585
5720553,3,B00CERJI5U,"This is a hard review for me to write about ""Hatchet 3"". No doubt in my mind that part one is classic, part two was plagued by stale acting but blessed with awesome gory & unique kills and part three, well at least it still has Danielle Harris in it! Seriously though all jokes aside, the acting is definitely a step up from part 2 but honestly the kills were nothing special this time around. Okay, I mean one guy gets his head cut in half and his brain falls out and another gets paramedic chest paddles to the head that makes it explode, other then that most kills are generic. I felt that even the gore was a step down from the previous films which was disappointing as well.

I'm really not trying to bash the film because I love Adam Greens work and the Hatchet series but part three was kind of a let down for me and if this is truly the end then yes, I am disappointed that the creativity of the kill scenes are not unique and as memorable as part one and two.

The pacing was good and never was I bored with the film, I did however dislike the actor who played the Sheriff, I didn't think he was that great, and I couldn't wait for the Swat team leader to get killed, he was over the top annoying. Overall I'm somewhere In between loving and hating ""Hatchet 3"". This member of the hatchet army is unfortunately stuck on the fence which truly sucks for me. Still I recommend you see the film and see for yourself, it's not a bad film it's just not as good as the previous two.",1372896000,,1484,4.149305555555555
5720554,2,B00CERJI5U,"""You come into a police station covered in someone else's blood head to toe. Your carrying a weapon and a piece of somebody's head and the best you got for me as an alibi is some kind of urban legend?"" Marybeth (Harris) has finally killed Victor Crowley. When she shows up at the police station covered in blood the sheriff doesn't believe her story and locks her up while his crew goes out to look at what happened. While they are there one by one they get killed. Is it possible that Victor has come back again? I'm not sure what the fascination is with trilogies lately but this is an example of a movie being made just because they wanted a trilogy for this series. The movie could have been done in about a half hour but it was drug out for an hour and a half. The movie is basically the sheriff yelling at everyone mixed in with gore and a lot of blood. The first one in the series was OK, but I never thought I wish they made more. Hopefully this one closes the series, but if they can make 6 Fast and Furious movies I'm not hanging on to the dream of no Hatchet 4. Overall, if you liked the others then you will like this, or if you like gratuitous gore and blood then this is for you. If you want an actual plot then look elsewhere. I give it a C-.",1372291200,,1257,4.07258064516129
5720555,3,B00CERJI5U,"HATCHET III (2013) - WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!! While slightly better than its predecessor, this second sequel still leaves a lot to be desired storywise, unless you watch these films only for the gore. If that's all you want, this film delivers the grue in bucket loads. It begins where the first sequel left off, where Marybeth (Danielle Harris, who is still as bad as she was in the first sequel, replacing Tamara Feldman in the original film) shoots Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder) in the face with a shotgun (although it looks like much more damage was done to his face in the first sequel) and walks away, only to have Crowley get up and chase her. During their struggle, Crowley falls on an operating chainsaw and is cut in half from stem to stern (outrageously graphic). Marybeth, who is soaked in blood, takes a piece of Crowley's face and walks into the local police station, still carrying the shotgun. She is immediately arrested, washed down by a power hose (What about preserving the evidence?) and put in a cell under suspicion of multiple murders, where Sheriff Fowler (Zach Galligan, a long career slide since his starring role in GREMLINS - 1984) interrogates Marybeth and she tells him that Victor Crowley was responsible, not her. Not believing her, he sends out a search team into the area she was in the swamps, only for the team to discover multiple body parts and bodies missing most of their skin. As the Sheriff heads to the area, with a boat crew of paramedics (including Andrew [Parry Shen, who returns from the first two films, but in a totally different role] and Randy [Sean Whalen; LAID TO REST - 2009]) and a S.W.A.T. team (headed by Hawes [Derek Mears, who played Jason Vorhees in the 2009 FRIDAY THE 13TH reboot]), the Sheriffs ex-wife, Amanda (Caroline Williams; THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2 - 1986, who overacts here to the point of parody), a disgraced reporter who hopes to prove her theory that Victor Crowley is real, talks Deputy Winslow (Robert Diago DoQui) into releasing Marybeth from her cell to defeat Victor Crowley once and for all. Amanda believes that only the people related to the persons responsible for Victor Crowley's father's death can kill him (Marybeth is the daughter of one of the deceased men, played by Robert Englund in the first film), so she, Marybeth and Deputy Winslow drive to the house of Abbott McMullen (Sid Haig, in a funny cameo performance as a hard-of-hearing racist), who has the cremated remains of Crowley's father in an urn. Amanda thinks that if Marybeth gives the urn to Victor Crowley, he will disappear for good and not be able to repeat the same day over-and-over. After nearly everyone is killed in the swamp by Crowley (gore-soaked deaths, including the decapitation of Sheriff Fowler using the gas-powered belt sander, which was also used in the first two films but doesn't exist in real life), the trio turn up in the swamp, where Amanda and Deputy Winslow are butchered by Crowley. Marybeth manages to throw the ashes of his father on Crowley's face after she is impaled on a tree branch. Crowley begins to disintegrate, but Marybeth makes sure that he is dead by blowing his body to bits with a shotgun blast. As Marybeth begins to takes her final breaths (?), the film cuts to black and the movie is over (a trademark of this franchise).  None of the film makes any sense at all and there are plot holes galore, but there are a few redeeming bits and pieces (pardon the pun), including a uncredited cameo from the first film's star, Joel David Moore, where we finally learn his fate. The gore is laid on hot and heavy and is very well done (by ""Aunt Dolly's Garage""), but the film has a overall cheapness to it. Adam Green doesn't direct this time (he just wrote the screenplay and executive produced it, along with six other people), handing over the reins to freshman director BJ McDonnell, who usually is an expert Steadicam operator on such films as THE COLLECTOR (2009) and its sequel THE COLLECTION (2012) and worked on the first two HATCHET films as well. McDonnell does all he can with a weak script (there's a funny scene concerning a man's testicles hanging from a tree branch), but it's apparent most of the film's meager budget was spent flying everyone to Louisiana (the film's locale and the first time the series has filmed there, lensed during the Spring and Summer of 2012, where many of the crew were hospitalized with numerous bug bites and heat exhaustion), the massive gore effects (all physical and no CGI enhancement, which is always a plus), weapons fire and explosions. But if you're just in the mood for a blood-spattered gorefest, you may overlook the film's many shortcomings and just go along for the ride. I'm sure there will be a Part 4 sometime in the future, but as of this review, none has been announced. I just hope they replace Danielle Harris this time. She's great on the eyes (she has a nude scene in this, revealing that she has a giant tattoo on her back), but her acting in the two sequels borderlines on amateurish. Also starring Cody Blue Snider, Rileah Vanderbilt, Jason Trost, John Michael Sudol and Diane Ayala Goldner. Adam Green appears as a drunk in a cell next to Marybeth.

5720556,3,B00CERJI5U,"What happened? If this was any other film besides ""Hatchet"" would I have liked it more? Maybe not, but if it was another film entirely I could give it SOME credit. HOWEVER having a first time director on a series of films that you are now ""executive producing"" I think is a bad idea. IF this was a film of his own devising with characters that he created, I wouldn't be so harsh, but man does it take a lower budget and lack of skills to already mess up something great.

The acting is VERY subpar, I'm not sure why that is, Danielle Harris' character took an odd turn, Derek Mears did a great job, I would have liked it more if his battle with Crowley was a bit more climactic.  When I noticed both he and Kane Hodder were going to be in this I was hoping for an epic battle of Jason Franchise greats. I wouldn't have minded if he actually was the one to finally take it to Crowely, but alas....I digress.

I didn't get a chance to confirm if KNB had their hands on the special effects of this installment, but if they did I'm sure it was their C team. This was just so obnoxiously badly done that it wasn't even fun to watch. There were no great memorable kills save for the first 5 minute scene at the beginning of the film. I'm sure if I had some tubing and some fake blood I could do better practical effects. Again...maybe it was the budget or Adam Green giving another director the chance he had to make a great film.  Mr. Green if you read this, never let strangers watch your kids. This is what happens.

Some of the script was ALMOST there, Adam Green did make a memorable appearance at the beginning as well as a professional nod by the director to him in some dialogue that was very funny. The cast had so much potential, but the film felt rushed, with quick kills and hardly any back story to make the characters likable. Derek Mears was impressive in his role, however I'm not a fan usually of his work.

If anyone ever thought that I had anything to do with this movie (a reference to my AWESOME review of Hatchet 2) here should be your answer. I'm glad I paid 7 bucks for this on Vudu and didn't drive 5 hours and paid movie theater prices plus food and drink for this one. With the last two movies combined I think I broke even, this was an awful followup to ""Hatchet 2"" and an depressing way to end the series.

5720582,5,B00CERJI5U,"I consider this the best of the Hatchet series.  The first two Hatchet movies were enjoyable, but I find this the most entertaining.

Danielle Harris returns from Hatchet II as Marybeth, starting where Hatchet II ended and has her going to the police station.  There she is arrested for having a shotgun, Victor Crowley's scalp, and being covered in blood.  The police investigate the swamp and are killed by Victor Crowley.  Kane Hodder returns as Victor, giving a menacing and gruesome portrayal of the character.  There's several graphic kills and the practical effects look fairly believable.  The movie features several horror movie stars including: Danielle Harris, from Halloween 4, 5, the remakes, and Hatchet II; Kane Hodder, from Friday the 13th Parts VII to Jason X and Hatchets I and II; Derek Mears from the Friday the 13th reboot; Zach Galligan from Gremlins; Caroline Williams from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre II; and Sid Haig from House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects.

The story is basic, Marybeth is arrested for believed murder, the police investigate the swamp, the SWAT team led by Derek Mears arrive, and they are killed by Victor.  Caroline Williams' character talks the remaining cop to take Marybeth to give Victor his father's ashes, believing the spell will be released.  The entire police and SWAT teams are killed except for one coroner.  Marybeth is impaled on a tree and spills the ashes on Victor and as he melts, she blows him up with a grenade launcher.  It is unknown whether she is alive or dead.  I believe she is alive.

This is easily the most entertaining, violent, graphic, and probably the funniest of the whole trilogy.  If you are a fan of the Hatchet movies or movies that are darkly comedic, I recommend this movie.  I would also say that it's better to understand the story if you watch them in chronological order because they are all closely connected and the whole trilogy takes place in a few days.

5720587,2,B00CERJI5U,"We all know that the killers in slasher films can take an inhuman amount of damage, enough to kill dozens of normal men, and still keep going.  But Hatchets Victor Crowley takes this amazing recuperation to new heights in Hatchet III.  The film begins right where part II left off.  Marybeth Dunstan (Danielle Harris) has just blown Crowleys face clean off with a shotgun blast.  But even that isn't enough to stop the bayou beast.  As Crowley rises again, Marybeth slices him in half from head to toe with a chainsaw.  Thinking that Crowley is finally dead, Marybeth turns herself in to the Jefferson Parish sheriff, covered in blood.  Sheriff Fowler (Zach Galligan of Gremlins) locks Marybeth up and sends a team of officers and paramedics out to investigate her claims of the slaughter at Honey Island Swamp.

The cops arrive on the scene to find dozens of mangled bodies including the split-in-half body of Crowley.  Crowleys remains are bagged and taken about a paramedics boat for processing.  This is where Crowley pulls off his amazing feat of putting himself back together whole.  And perhaps even more amazing is that his overalls also magically are repaired without a stich out of place.

Ok, I have not been overly impressed with any of Adam Greens Hatchet films even though he turns directorial duties over to BJ McDonnell.  But Hatchet III reaches a new low.  Were given some new mumbo jumbo about how Crowley is actually a ghost and needs to be reunited with the ashes of his father in order to finally kill him.  As Marybeth is the last relative of the men that killed Crowley years earlier and only she fan deliver the ashes.  Yeah, ok, anything to suck the remaining life out of the series.

Granted, Hatchet III should satisfy most gore hounds.  Among Crowleys more notable kills is thrusting his fist into the belly of a man and ripping out his spine with the skull still attached, leaving behind an empty meat sack.  The effects however are cheap looking, even for low budget horror film.  The blood looks like it was left over from a Herschell Gordon Lewis film.  Its too bright and lacks the viscosity of actual blood.

The cast features Sid Haig, Derek Mears and of course, Kane Hodder as Crowley,and  is a lot of fun, but largely wasted.  In particular Danielle Harris is given little to do other than apparently say F**K as many times as she can in 81 minutes.",1438387200,,2386,4.680288461538462

5720606,2,B00CERJI5U,"Have you seen either of the previous ""Hatchet"" films?  If not; what are you doing here?  If you haven't then you need to go see those two films first.  Then, don't come to see this one because you've already been there.  The big difference is you won't enjoy the trip as much this time because it's just getting too crowded and over done.  What the heck am I talking about anyway?  Let's hack into the meat of this.

OH LOOK (YAWN), HE'S PULLING OUT ANOTHER SPINE (SIGH).
I think you get the picture.  The ""Hatchet"" series, up to this point, is known and revered for its over-the-top inventive gore, gratuitous nudity, and cheeky story telling.  What we get with ""Hatchet III"" is much of the same, less of the same, and none of the same.  Let me clarify this:  All the same methods of killifying, fewer of them that we actually see, and absolutely no gratuitous nudity worth mentioning.  I say ""no gratuitous nudity"" because there is a scene where nude Danielle Harris (Halloween remake, Hatchet 2) is hosed down in jail but you don't really get to see anything (if that sort of thing matters to you).  Also, way too many of the kills (I lost count) happen off screen.  That's just a little lazy.  The story is very much like the other two films, only this time there are police getting butchered by Victor Crowley and they added a slightly new twist to his legend.  Honestly, they're not really trying to tell a story anymore.  Just set up a line of corpses-to-be and get on with it.  I didn't think that warranted the making of another Hatchet film.

A REVOLTING DEVELOPMENT
Let's talk about character development.  Uh...  ...seriously?  Ok, to be fair some of these characters, though very thin, are likable.  The rest are killed for our mercy.  To say more about it would just be superfluous.

A WHO'S WHO OF ""WHO'S THAT?""
Besides Danielle Harris, Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees), Zack Galligan (Gremlins series, Waxworks), Caroline Williams (Many horror and TV credits), Jason Trost (All Superheroes Must Die), Derek Mears (Jason Voorhees, many TV horror roles), and Sean Whalen (Everything Jason Trost does) all appear in this film.  Perry Shen appears in all 3 films and gets killed every time.  They don't even try to explain that in this film.  None of the actors are great.  None of the actors are painfully bad.  They all make great corpses though.

IS THERE ANY REDEMTION?
The one kernel of value this film has is the aforementioned ""new twist"" in the Victor Crowley legend.  Without spoiling anything... heck, HUGE SPOILER ALERT:  It appears Victor can only be stopped by dumping the ashes of his long-dead daddy on him.  Honestly, this is so stupid; I hardly consider it a spoiler.  Also, it is never confirmed that he will stay dead anyway.  By the way, in the first two films, Victor had often gone down after getting shot by a gun, while in this film not even an entire firing-line of cops can bring him down.  Crap.

WHAT ABOUT THE PACKAGE?
There are extras that are fairly entertaining; more ""behind the scenes"" than a ""making of"".  You also get a trailer and Kane Hodder in the makeup chair; meh.  Other than that, there is nothing remarkable about the package.

SO WHAT'S THE POINT?
If I have to guess, I'd say this film was made for three reasons:  1.  Adam Green (Producer) really enjoys making movies and this series has been successful enough that he could get the funding to make a third one.  2.  It provided a venue for all of Adam's Indy-film buddies to get together and have some fun while getting some work in.  Watch the extras and you'll get the same impression.  3.  MONEY GRAB!!  Add it all up and you get a pretty pointless film that falls short of its predecessors.  Motivated more by profit and self gratification than producing another pseudo-fan-film, Hatchet III is a trip into the swamp worth skipping.

5720607,4,B00CERJI5U,"If you enjoyed ""Hatchet"" and ""Hatchet II"", you'll enjoy this latest sequel. Following right on the events of the 2nd film, Marybeth (Danielle Harris) seeminly finishes off Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder) and stumbles into town to report the latest mass murder to the police, only to be arrested as the prime suspect in the killings. There is some hoodoo about Marybeth being the daughter of the man that set the fire years ago which led to Crowley's rampage, and that because of this, Marybeth is the only one who can stop Crowley. This is just an excuse to get a bunch of people back out into the woods so that Crowley can take them out in inventive and gory ways.

This series is so much fun, and while I don't feel this entry lives up to the previous films, the formula still works. Populated with fun cameos by genre favorites, and featuring some fun dialogue and extra gooey gore F/X, ""Hatchet"" is a horror series created by horror fans, for horror fans. While I doubt you'll actually be frightened by the film, you will be having such a good time, you won't really care.",1411344000,3,1073,4.530927835051546

HATCHET III is a stylish conclusion to the franchise, with BJ McDonnell admirably taking over in the director's chair. Danielle Harris is superb (when is she not?), and Caroline Williams steps up to the plate with a fine performance. Zach (Gremlins) Galligan is also spot on and there's a host of cameos and in jokes to tickle genre enthusiasts funny bones whilst legendary Kane Hodder crushes, pulverises and stomps through the swamp as Victor.  #HatchetArmy",1398816000,3,799,5.0

I read the negative reviews but decided to take a chance and I have to say that while Hatchet 2 was my favorite, part 3 held it's own and I don't regret buying it. Aside from the blood and gore and always creative ways Victor Crowley kills his hapless victims, there are plenty funny moments throughout.",1393977600,,525,4.26
5720624,3,B00CERJI5U,"I was fairly hesitent going into this one as I honestly couldn't figure out a reason for this series to continue. As I viewed the film, I found myself enjoying bits and peices but wasn't happy with the overall product. What I liked was the kills were still gruesome and that I found parts of the film funny and that's actually it.

As for flaws, this film had all kinds of them. Firstly the opening shot looked nothing like the first two films. In previous films the swamp looked dark and hard to see through, here it was very bright and I could see for yards in every direction. Marybeth has regained the emotionally tough exterior but it feels out of place in this movie (yes I kind of argued that for the last one). Also this movie really isn't about Marybeth, she barely has any importance except to swear at people and hold one item. Such a waste of Danielle Harris in my opinion. While I found the movie funny, the humor undermined the storyline in many situations unlike the previous two movies. Finally I wanted characters in this movie to die, cuz I didn't care for them. In the previous movie I felt sorry when most died, here I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters except Marybeth.

I got this at a reasonable price comparable to a trip to the theater, and so I believe it was worth the ""price of admission.""

Hatchet III (2013) *
D: BJ McDonnell
C: Danielle Harris, Kane Hodder, Zach Galligan, Caroline Williams, Robert Diago DoQui, Derek Mears, Cody Blue Snider, Rileah Vanderbilt, Sean Whalen, Jason Trost, Diane Ayala Goldner
P: Picking up directly where the second one left off, lone survivor MaryBeth (Harris) is thrown in jail, while the police try to make sense of the bloodbath that occurred in the second film, but of course Victor Crowley (Hodder) isn't dead. And of course, yet another bloodbath ensures, but this time around MaryBeth might have just figured out a way to end it all.

In all honesty, part two was completely and utterly unnecessary. So I think it goes without saying that a third Hatchet film was completely unwarranted. If you're a fan of the series, the film features an all star cast along with plenty of gore and violence, which has been a trademark of this series.

Danielle Harris is wasted for most of the film's running time and isn't given much to do. The film might have an all star cast, but I think it is more important to have the right person for the right role and that's an area that the film falls short on. The roles are poorly written. The cast does what they can with the material, but nobody shines through, nobody stands out.

There's lots of gore, but gore doesn't necessarily equate to horror. The first Hatchet film is the only entry to date that found a balance between being truly scary, while managing to pack in plenty of violence for the gore hounds out there. There's some sporadic laughs here and there, but nothing memorable, nothing laugh out loud worthy.

With the first Hatchet film, I thought the film was slow to start, but once it got going, it blew me away. Hatchet III feels like a sequel that just goes through the motions and offers absolutely nothing new, nothing to get me excited, nothing that recaptures that WOW feeling I felt the first time around when I watched the first Hatchet film.

Once again Kane Hodder is back in your face as the notorious Victor Crowley a crazed psychopathic killer still wanting vengeance over his fathers death, this movie yet again steps up in the gore factor and pushes the boundaries with probably the highest body count to date, there id blood and gore splashing all over non stop! The story is great and kept old school kind of like the good old days when Jason Voorhees keep coming back from the dead, Danielle Harris reprises her lead role as the movie continues right where the second left off, there's a few old school twists and turns in the plot and some very funny moments too, looks out for cameos too from the original director and several stars from the original hatchet movie too, this is great fun good old retro slasher gore horror at its best since Jason was on our screens, just have fun and bask in the blood rain!!!!

I do think the Blu-ray edition could have been better than what it was.

5720645,4,B00CERJI5U,"This story picks up with Marybeth (Danielle Harris) ""killing"" Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder) again. It was nice of the producers to use the same person to play Marybeth this time. She is in jail while local police check Honey Island Swamp only to find a bloody mess. Like Jason, Victor never dies so you can figure out the rest.

Sid Haig has a bit part in this film having comedic ""Paula Deen moments."" I did not enjoy this as much as the one with Tony Todd. This film had its comic and dark comedy moments, but was pretty much an over the top slasher with blood spraying unrealistically all over the screen as if it was coming out of a pressure washer. The characters were decent in this one, but the film lacked a certain eye candy. Plenty of blood and gore, easy on plot.

This film however was amazing and easily ties with the first in terms of overall enjoyment. The storyline was very interesting and well done, I went into this expecting a mindless bloodbath, but you actually get a surprisingly solid storyline along with the bloodbath, which is a very nice change of pace. The acting in this film was honestly probably some of the best I have seen in the trilogy, Danielle really stepped up her game this time around and did an excellent job, I could really feel her emotions boiling this time. Caroline and Zach really surprised me in this film as well, they certainly still have what it takes to do horror, I especially loved the passion that you could feel from Caroline's character. My only complaint this time around would be the quality of the kills, don't get me wrong there were still many great kills, but they did lack the creativity we have all became so used to. The special effects were still great and there was plenty of blood to go around! Overall the movie had me on the edge of my seat with anticipation and even got a few chuckles from me. It was great to see some throwbacks to the past films and seeing some familiar faces.

The bodycount is at its highest, the gore is plentiful and gruesome, and the cameo roles from a few of your horror movie favorites are there to boot.  This ""final"" go round with Victor Crowley didn't contain the obligatory sex scenes or boobage of Hatchets past, but we do see Danielle Harris get hosed down ""Rambo style"" in a jail shower...(We even see her sexy tattoo!)..and for the ladies, well, they get to live out their fantasy of seeing a set of gonads hanging from a tree branch. (insert your own hated ""ex"" here, girls)  Not wanting to give anything crucial away to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, my lips are sealed...but we do finally get to hear Victor utter something besides those grunts, growls and gutteral howls echoing from the swamp.

 The only problem I had was the ending. While I'm all for horror movie sequels (the 80's Elm Street & Friday the 13th series, the first 3 Child's Play films, the first 4 Hellraiser movies). I hope they end this series before it gets REAL BAD (any Hellraiser film past Bloodline, Bride & Seed of Chucky, Scream 3 & 4,).",1376784000,,416,4.1875

If you are a fan of the first two films in this series, you will enjoy this one as well. It sets out to do exactly what you would expect from a film of this caliber.

This one picks up right where the last film left off and quickly gets to gross out over the top violence, It features actors from various horror classics like the last two, and Victor Crowley kills pretty much everyone that crosses his path, just like the last two.

Usually when a sequel in a franchise doesn't explore new ground, I get kind of bored with the series, but for some reason Hatchet seems to be the exception for me. As long as there is little plot development and gallons of blood, count me in for Hatchet 4 as well.",1376611200,,784,4.111111111111111

although the kills in this installment were just a bit weaker than the first 2 installments. It still did it for me for some reason. Being real even much weaker kills from 1 and 2 would be considered over the top.

I say everyone should give this one a chance after all don't you want to see how it all ends?
Caroline Williams really amped up the acting for me and not having seen her since TCM 2 and a cameo in Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 she was a pleasant surprise. Derek Mears,Parry Shen and of course Danielle Harris were great as well.

It seemed as though There is more of a story to this one even though I really liked the back stories in parts1 and 2. I give this 2 thumbs up.",1376524800,,845,4.236024844720497
5720663,5,B00CERJI5U,"If you are a fan of the Hatchet films then you already know it will be a good time, and it is.

This series has always been mapped out as a trilogy without the promise of getting to make them all. Green was ok with where each one left off and crossed his fingers to make the next. So the silly analysis that this was for money and making it into a trilogy in a forced and late manner, is just simply not correct.

Fans will enjoy higher body counts and more elaborate kills. Also higher fire power from those trying to bring Vic down. It does what it should do, raise the testosterone with more action, gore, and fun. Why people are complaining about that is beyond me considering this part 3 in a series that I am guessing they have seen the first two from? I guess some just need a chance to feel important.

Fans will also enjoy the on-location filming that the previous two did not have. Unlike the first two films; this is shot in Louisiana. The crew got put through hell with the elements; but ultimately it pays off visually. The shots are wider and it just looks fantastic.

So....skip the unfounded idiocy being posted on here about the film and go enjoy yourself. It was made for the fans and is supposed to be fun. Hatchet fans, as usual, will not be disappointed.

To those who hate it, that's fine, it was not made for you to begin with.",1376352000,3,1350,4.2578125

It was crammed full of comedy, the writing was excellent, the storyline at least plausible, and no one seemed safe.  Then, we had the sequel, which was only interested in upping the ante on the gross factor.  Now, we're treated to Hatchet III where basically you have nothing but one kill after another.  Oh, and we are not talking about just some simple kills; no, people have to be torn apart, castrated, skinned, chainsawed, and beheaded.  In fact, this movie may hold the record for beheadings.  I will have to check into that...NOT.

Part 3 apparently takes off from where part 2 ended.  Marybeth is slugging it out with Victor Crowley because she is hell-bent on revenge for her father and her brother.  Crowley took care of them in Part 1, but I digress.  She completely destroys Crowley, but of course we know she didn't really kill him.  He has received monster cult status like Michael Meyers, Freddie Kruger, and Jason.  She tiptoes into the local police station, is immediately accused of the mass killings she has told the local law officials about, and is thrown into jail.  That is where she encounters a completely over-the-top sheriff, played by Zach Gallagan.  Never understood why he was so MAD from the beginning of the film, but, again, I digress.  He sends out a slew of deputies out to Honey Island Swamp (a/k/a Victor Crowley's stomping ground), along with EMTs and other people who obviously don't want to live long, and soon the massacre starts all over again.

What started out as a hopeful franchise has now disintegrated into another ""Wrong Turn 5.""  There are no real characters here--just caricatures.  Even all the old stars of former horror movies who made appearances in here (Caroline Williams of Texas Chainsaw Massacre II fame, Sid Haig [""House of 1000 Corpses"" and the much-underrated ""Devil's Rejects],"" Kane Hodder as Crowley, and Danielle Harris of the [Halloween Part Pi films]) couldn't help this mess.  All this movie was about was the gore. Oh, and as an aside, the casting people had (for the THIRD time) cast one of the original cast members to play another part.  Talk about pitch-til-ya'-win...

People wonder why horror is--pardon the pun--a dying industry.  To answer that question, all you need to do is watch this.  UR for gore and language.",1376352000,2,2378,4.802955665024631

8581019,5,B00CERJI5U,"Perhaps redeeming the franchise for the previous sequel, and matching the former glory of part 1! Oh, and sooooooooooo wonderfully, deliciously, splatteringly gory!!!!

Part II SIDEBAR: So after Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder; Friday the 13th parts VII-X, Hatchet) survived being burned alive and speared through the neck in part 1, he pulled a Jason Voorhees and aquatic-ambushed Marybeth (then played by Tamara Feldman), the credits rolling with Marybeth in his clutches. Replacing Tamara Feldman as Marybeth, Danielle Harris (Halloween I-II, The Black Waters of Echos Pond) escapes Crowley and assembles a hunting party to put an end to the curse and avenge her murdered alligator-poaching family.  Part II ended when Marybeth gave Victor Crowley a mutilating head smashing with his own hatchet and then finished off his skull muck with a shot gun. So, clearly, hes dead now, right? Psssssh.

As if apologizing for the notable drop in quality observed in part II, director BJ McDonnell picks up former writer/director Adam Greens (Frozen, Hatchet I-II) spoofy franchise and begins part III with a mushy gooey extra sloppy opener! Thats right, Crowley impossibly got right back up with nothing but Sloppy Joe filling for a face! Gorehounds will rejoice as Marybeth buries her fist into Crowleys caved in face with all the lip-smacking sound effects of stomping your boots in thick sludgy mud. Oh, and the chainsaw-induced gore just delicious!

Franchise Timeline SIDEBAR: Note that part 1 took place in just one day, and part II was the very next day much as the swift continuity of Friday the 13th parts II-IV. Now part III begins right after Marybeth shot Crowley in the face or what was left of it. So these three movies span only three back-to-back days in movieland.

Sheriff Fowler (Zach Galligan; Waxwork, Gremlins) and his local Crowley folklore expert ex-wife (Caroline Williams; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Leprechaun 3) team up with Marybeth and SWAT leader Hawes (Derek Mears; Friday the 13th, Cursed) to put an end to the unkillable mutant hillbilly Crowley. Rounding out the cast, Parry Shen (The Hazing/Dead Scared) returns yet again in a third role (Andrew) in as many movies after playing the part IIs brother (Shawn) of part Is tour guide (Justin)!

This third franchise installment brings viciously awesome pacing and completely redeems 2010s slow starting (and slow middling) sequel by delivering a defibrillator death scene, loads of spine-ripping and limb-tearing dismemberment, torso rending, severed head throwing (at other victims!!!!), head gauging, head exploding, head splitting and smushy gushy head stomping. The gore is heavy and by the end everything is painted in blood! Amid the zany fun are nods to Predator (1987; shooting down the forest), Jason Voorhees incredible resurrections (e.g., the knife in the head), 80s death curses (e.g., Myers and Voorhees), and Fright Nights (1985) disturbingly messy melting death.

The whole curse thing was probably the weakest aspect of the movie, but who could even care or notice? There was so much action and blood and gore horrorhounds will find themselves smiling throughout the entire running time of this wonderful sequel that does true honor to the 2006 original and forgives any hiccups of part II.",1521590400,,3282,5.216318785578748

I saw Hatchet III and the first part of the movie has a 6' long chain saw coming up through crowleys chest blowing blood all over the chick that put it under him and that was the first part. I realized it could only get better for then on out. Love this Movie, I hope you are in to guts, gore and lots of blood!!!!!!!!",1514505600,,421,3.9069767441860463
8581022,2,B00CERJI5U,"After having streamed the first Hatchet movie, rented the second, having loved them both enough to buy them both simultaneously, it felt as though this series could only stand to get better and better.  Well after overhearing people in so many ways never having the same exact kind of reverence towards this chapter, I figured that there is just no possible way that this movie could possibly be so beneath either of the other 2 Hatchet movies so I bought this movie blindly.  Well suffice it to say that after sitting through this dreadful friggin' train-wreck, I wish that I had just rented it instead.

There is so much unbelievable sh** that's wrong with this movie that it's shocking beyond belief.

Let's begin with the fact that Adam Green gave up his director's chair to some buddy of his named BJ McConnell.  McConnell was a huge mistake to pick as director of this movie as his credits are mostly in being a camera operator, a grip and key grip and very little else.  He has never directed a full length movie prior to this one and since then only movie shorts and music videos.  His tremendous lack of experience should not only have proven to be a considerable red flag for Adam Green to ever consider hiring him to direct this 3rd chapter especially when part 1 and 2 were such strong chapters to where room for error is nil, but also how badly he directs this sorry p.o.s. just speaks for itself.

The casting:  Bringing drop dead gorgeous and hot as lava actress Danielle Harris was a welcomed move.  Getting Derek Mears(Jason Voorhees from F13 2009 remake) to star in this movie proved a great move also as Derek's performance(albeit stereotypically macho) was really good.  Derek pulled off his role as Tyler Hawes with lots of conviction and bringing to mind any militant type that has a take charge kind of disposition.  Caroline Williams(Stretch from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2) while continuing to look amazingly well aged, gorgeous, and still very sexy, she overacted to where she was unbearable.  Her performance in TCM 2 wasn't perfect but at least she wasn't hammy in that movie.  Also her attempt at a Cajun accent was atrocious.  Kane Hodder was still great and brutal as Victor Crowley.  Parry Shen plays a character that this time isn't related to Shaun but he doesn't bring anything to the movie this time.  This time Parry is dull, kind of a d***, and not funny once.  Sean Whalen(Laid To Rest, Drive Thru) didn't get enough part in this movie to offer anything memorable in his performance.  Zach Galligan(Gremlins 1&2, Waxwork 1&2, Cyborg 3) should never have been chosen to play Sheriff Fowler.  Not only is Zach a terrible act and always has been, but playing an authority figure doesn't suit him to say nothing of his attempt at a Cajun accent being laughable beyond words.  Sexy Rileah Vanderbilt(Frozen The horror movie not the Disney movie) was thrown in at the last minute to play some character named Dougherty.  Who this character is and why she's thrown in for such a short performance is anyone's guess.

The humor and camp was one of the great things that drew me to this series.  Unfortunately, there is little to no humor to be this time and never any camp once.  This time the humor is just at random moments and isn't always carried out that well.  Sexy Danielle Harris gets some intermittent one-liners and Sid Haig's small appearance in this movie was funny at times.  Other than that there's barely any good laughs or any laughs in general to be found.

This time you get no sex scenes and no real nudity.  There is just one slight shot of Danielle's butt and that's all you get.  As a result, the eye-candy is still intact but not the sexy side that the first 2 offered.  WTF?!!

There are no characters that are even a little bit interesting.  The characters in this are so flat, dull, and not offering anyone that there is any reason to care about.  Even in part 2 the one-dimensional hunters were funny and somewhat interesting.

Victor Crowley doesn't hide in the shadows as much as he did before so there is absolutely no suspense and you can totally predict who's going to die.  As a result, nothing about this movie proves scary in the least.

The killings were not only rushed but Victor didn't go after his victims in much of a variety of ways.  Given that, there isn't a single good kill scene in this movie.

The gore is the only thing that this movie has going for it and that's it.

All in all, if you're expecting this movie to come through with the same kind of terror and suspense, cool kill scenes, excitement, humor, camp, interesting characters to like and identify with, nudity and/or sex scenes, even pacing, or even as good of acting(Derek Mears being the only stand out performance here) as the first 2 Hatchet movies, well then you best look elsewhere because this chapter is an epic failure where no effort was made at anything other than the gore.  I wouldn't recommend this turdfest to my most annoying neighbor.  1 and a half stars out of 10!!",1507161600,,5023,4.623024830699774
