5059837,4,B0077ATSU4,"Saw it yesterday, can't stop thinking about it. Not the most perfect movie ever made, but certainly watchable and moves along at a rapid pace. Newcomer child-actor Thomas Horn did a fantastic job of acting as he had to run the gamut of heavy emotions, he being beset with a huge guilt that he has not the age experience to deal with, hence his tantrums and minor transgressions. Horn should have been nominated for an Academy Award. His explosionn of emotion towards Von Sydow's character of what he was trying to accomplish was the best scene in the movie and great acting by Horn. I predict a big future for him.  I'm not familiar with Foer's books, but found this story credible and I'd see this movie twice (unlike the sucky, sappy ""War Horse"" I saw only a month before.)

Great cinematography, a beautiful scene was of the NY sidewalk at night with everyone posting pictures of missing loved ones. The quiet dignity of those courageous survivors and I think I could actually feel the heat of the lit candles under the pictures. I felt as if I was there. Hanks and Bullock  barely have any screen time, but the job got done just the same.

For adults looking for some adult drama with all the adult perks (no superheroes, comic book, fairy tale or teen-aged vampire characters), this is a great way to spend an afternoon.

P.S. Just caught a movie today on TV ""Everything is Illuminated"" which is basically a biography of author Foer on his trip to the Ukraine to find out what happened to his grandfather at the hands of the Nazis. Directed and adapted to the screen very competently by actor Liev Schrieber from Foer's book. Both funny as hell and heart-breaking. Suggest you catch this one if you like Extremely Loud....",1327622400,3,1727,4.612377850162867
5059838,4,B0077ATSU4,"If you go to the cinema looking for pulse-pounding action and over-the-top antics, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" can be crossed off your ""to watch"" list.  However, if you are entranced by emotions, adventure, and character development, this film will likely suck you in and not let go until the credits roll.

For a basic plot summary, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" begins by showing the extraordinary loving relationship between Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) and his father Thomas (Tom Hanks).  When Thomas is killed during the 9/11 attacks in New York City, little Oskar is devastated.  In trying to re-connect with the presence of his father, Oskar finds a strange key in his father's closet and sets out on a quest to find out its meaning.  Along the way, Oskar meets up with an older gentleman (played by Max von Sydow) who helps him along.

The remarkable aspect of this film is how it sets up such an emotional bond between father and son in a matter of minutes.  When Thomas is killed, you will feel a crushing sense of loss and as such root even harder for young Oskar to see through his epic quest.  Even when the primary narrative may wane from time to time, the young boy's incredible love for his father will be what keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The characters are also very well-acted in this movie.  Horn carries the film in practically every scene, while Hanks is well, Hanks for the short time he is on screen.  Sydow picks up a key role roughly half way through the movie, while Sandra Bullock (""Mom"" Schell) plays the grieving widower with great passion.

This is a very down-to-earth film, as well.  Nothing is over-the-top or overly dramatic.  Without giving away any spoilers, I can say that the ending of the film may not initially gratify you, but once pondered upon will reveal itself as the right kind of conclusion for such a real-world effort.

Overall, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is likely to, at the very least, find you rooting on young Oskar Schell as step by step he gets closer to re-discovering his father.  The experience will make you both think and feel long after the lights come up.",1327276800,4,2150,4.663129973474801
5059839,4,B0077ATSU4,"I'm happy to see that film makers and actors have been able to use the tragedy of 9/11 to make money from it.  I think an important part of our tradition as people in general - not just Americans - is to show deep and meaningful sorrow and unity after a tragedy, and then wait a while for the dust to settle.  Then we can make movies about the tragedy for entertainment and money... It's a way of helping us be entertained - and entertainment and money are the most important aspects of life.",1327190400,3,492,4.223404255319149
5059840,5,B0077ATSU4,"Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) shares an incredibly close relationship with his father, Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks). Oskar is an extraordinary child who has some very particular social quirks. His list is rather extensive and it's revealed that he was once tested for Asperger's Syndrome. However, Thomas Schell spends a great amount of time with his son and does everything he can to help him overcome his fears. However, on September 11, 2001 as the world changes forever, tragically so does the life of Oskar and his mother, Linda (Sandra Bullock), as Thomas was in the second tower of the World Trade Center when it fell. Linda attempts to move on with life, but Oskar refuses to move forward. A year later, he accidently destroys a blue vase while rummaging through his father's closet and discovers a key in an envelope simply marked ""Black"". Thomas constantly played games with Oskar and led him on journeys around the city, hiding clues and prizes in the most unexpected places. Oskar is convinced the key is a gift left behind by his father to send him on one last adventure. Determined to find the door the key unlocks, Oskar begins a systematic search of the city, trying to locate the person with the last name ""Black"" who will be able to help him solve the mystery. Along the way, Oskar becomes acquainted with a man his grandmother has been renting a room to. The man seems to have no name and is simply known as ""The Renter"" (Max Von Sydow). The Renter is a survivor of WWII and reminds Oskar of his father. The two become unlikely companions and friends as they search the city to unravel the mystery of the key.

EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is based upon a 2005 novel by Jonathan Foer. I've not read the novel, so I can't compare the movie to the book.

The movie is an extremely moving piece of cinema. It goes to places that the audience might not suspect. The movie has a satisfying ending, but it's not necessarily a happy one. Like life, Oskar's journey doesn't turn out exactly as he had hoped. However, like all journeys, it changes his life forever.

The acting in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is amazing. Tom Hanks plays a small, but important role. Newcomer Thomas Horn is so powerful that it's difficult to believe this is the first time he's ever acted on film before. Sandra Bullock has a strong supporting role that is worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Max Von Sydow speaks no lines, but his eyes speak more and convey more emotion than the most well trained politician. John Goodman has what is basically a cameo as Stan the Doorman, but it's always a joy to watch Goodman perform, even in a role such as this. There are numerous smaller roles in the various Blacks that Oskar meets. Most of these characters are only on screen for a few brief moments but each of them ground their scenes in realism. EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a good movie that is made great by the acting performances. If for no other reason, it's worth watching for the acting alone.

EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a very emotional movie. For Americans, particularly those who lived and worked in New York on September 11, 2001, it will probably have a different kind of reaction. However, though the story is told through the lens of September 11th, the film is really a story about a young man coming to grips with the unexpected death of his father. It's a film that will probably resonate with anyone who has lost a parent they were close to. I cried several times and the film really made me think about my own Dad and his untimely death.  I left the theatre thinking about many of the memories I have of my Dad. It made me a little sad, but very grateful. In the future, I'm sure that EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a movie I'll watch whenever I'm sad and thinking about my Dad because I know that though it might cause a few tears, it'll cheer me up in the end and, like Thomas Schell and my own father, encourage me to not stop looking for whatever adventure life holds.",1327104000,74,4032,4.555862068965517
5059841,5,B0077ATSU4,"Possibly the most unique movie of the past few years. Oscar, played by Thomas Horn, carries the weight of the movie on his capable shoulders. He appears to be an autistic savant, possibly Aspergers syndrome. Oscar has lost his father in the twin towers attack of 9/11.  Here is what I found challenging- we empathize with his loss, but find it difficult to relate to him personally. Simply put- he isn't a very likable young man. He swears at the security guard and is rather mean to his mother; however,  I believe his story is one of the best portrayals of grief response I have ever seen. In real life, whether autistic or not, people don't always respond to life's trials with grace. It hurts... it hurts bad, and maybe the last thing they need are superficial pat statements such as ""It will all work for good"", ""He is in a better place"", or ""He's still alive because he's alive in your heart"".  Please note- I personally believe that these comments are true, but for the person in grief, they can be detrimental- each of the comments listed are also saying-""You shouldn't be hurting as badly as you are"".
  Oscar, on a quest to solve his ""father's final mystery"" is desperately trying to hold on to his father- the ""only one"" who really understood him. SPOILER ALERT- ENDING REVEALED BEYOND THIS POINT- While watching this movie, I found myself becoming  critical of the storyline. There were 2 growing issues. 1. Why were all these strangers allowing Oscar into their homes and lives? It seemed unrealistic to me, right from the first Mrs. Black that he visited. Why did she open the door? 2. Why was the mother so distant from Oscar? Sandra Bullock's character was grieving too, but she appeared to be nothing more than a movie prop.  Alas, I was so wrong on both accounts! She knew exactly what Oscar was doing, and had secretly visited all the Black's on the list in advance- to lovingly make her son's journey an easier one!  What a beautiful ending! What love this mother has for her child! She knows him- as well as her husband did. She is his guardian angel, his protector, and his champion. She understood what no other human being on the planet could have understood- Oscar needed this journey, this quest, in order to find peace- to make ""sense"" of something senseless. WOW!
  One last point- I stated earlier that Oscar is not a real likable little boy- that too is wrong.  He is grieving, he is a bit ""different"", and he doesn't talk respectfully to adults- but... he is absolutely wonderful. I will never forget the wonder and beauty of one scene- He has harsh words with his mother, he leaves, but then stops... he whispers through the bottom of a closed door ""I love you"". He isn't sure if she is even there to hear it, but of course she is... she's always there. If you are a parent, especially if you have a child with special needs, this movie stands as a testament to the beauty of what you do each and every day. It isn't easy, and most will never know of the love and the sacrifices you make- but you are your child's angel... his protector... her champion!",1327104000,8,3085,4.530575539568345
5059842,5,B0077ATSU4,"Review of the film(not DVD) - EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS - I literally knew nothing about the movie except that the fictional storyline concerned a boy dealing with his father's death during the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers. A friend of mine received passes to an early showing in NYC, and she invited me to attend a few hours before the screening. Since I particularly enjoy the acting of Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks, I immediately accepted.  The timing  was fortunate because I had no preconceptions and had no time to research any  details; thus, the story unfolded as a complete surprise - rather than with the foreknowledge which many reviews and plot descriptions on most of the movie sites provide. (E.g. the NEW YORKER article/review which I subsequently read basically reveals te whole story so that te author can criticize it.)  I would highly recommend that you see the movie without immersing yourself beforehand in the plot details. Thus, I have intentionally chosen not to discuss them in this review. (One of my pet peeves is reviews of both books and films which provide spoilers.)

 N.B. I am not a fan of the writing of Jonathan Safran Foer and so cannot compare this movie's script with his book on which it is based.

The star of both the story and the film is Oskar Schell, an 11 year old boy who is played by Thomas Horn. We meet Oskar and his father (who is also his mentor and best friend) Thomas (Tom Hanks) enjoying some time together in Central Park, Soon after that, the lives of Oskar and his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) life are tragically altered and their relationship incredibly stressed by the 9/11 tragedy. The remainder of the story then revolves about Oskar's journey , emotional and physical throughout NYC, as he attempts to cope with the aftermath of his father's death and his actions during and reaction to the events of that day (which are very tensely revealed in several flashbacks). We meet many individuals who play a role in Oskar's attempt to unravel the mysteries left behind by his father. Among these are his grandmother (Thomas's mother) , played by Zoe Caldwell, who lives across thee street and who Oskar can observe and signal from his bedroom window. In addition, his grandmother's taciturn and mysterious boarder (wonderfuly acted by  Max von Sydow), plays a crucial role in Oskar's travels and the eventual personal transformation that occurs.

My perspective on and reactions to the film are deeply influenced  by the fact that I work and live part time in NYC. (My office in fact had a wonderful view of the Twin Towers and their sudden absence and the alteration of the horizon for years was a constant reminder of the tragedy.)  I attended meetings in the WTC numerous time, and  had several good friends who were murdered by the terrorists that day. Thus, recollections of those attacks and their aftermath still evoke strong emotions for me, although my own  emotional journey was obviously much less intense and directly personal than Oskar's.

This movie will understandably and inevitably evoke varied responses given the power emotional impact of that day and the lens which each individual will view the film. For me, however, while far from perfect for a variety of mostly minor reasons, it was immensely engaging, very well acted and directed, and in its totality and conclusion tremendously life affirming (rather than sad, tragic, or disturbing).  As I stated, I found a few brief segments very tense and psychologically powerful; however, the tension was frequently lightened by intermittent humorous segments, many involving the diverse individuals who Oskar encountered during his journey.

I want to both emphasize and assure (or warn or disappoint as the case may be) potential  moviegoers  that it is in no way either a political statement or factual examination of the event! Rather it is a fictional account of its impact on an 11 year old boy and those with whom he comes in contact during his attempts to cope with his father's death, whose impact was totally unexpected and devastating.

So, if you want to see an EXTREMELY INTENSE BUT INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE film about the resiliency of the human spirit when faced with overwhelming tragedy, I strongly recommend EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE. It is approximately two hours long, and I felt that it was time well spent. It is a serious story about youth, sorrow and joy, the attempt to extract meaning from adversity, personal relationships, and the role of humor is helping us cope and adapt. And I emphasize again, I found its conclusion as life affirming as did Oskar and his family and the friends who he made. Just remember that it is fiction in the service of a search for truths concerning our existence, and neither an historical examination  of the events of 9/11 or simply light entertainment.

HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED - with a slight deduction from a full five star rating for a few loose ends that could have easily been tied up and for one relatively unbelievable revelation very late in the film.

5059843,4,B0077ATSU4,"Adapted from the 2005 novel by Jonathan S. Foer, this is a brilliant film that certainly has Academy Award potential.  The acting is exceptional, the theme a haunting one and even though there are some parts of the plot that do not ring true, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and it left me deeply moved, sad and crying at the end.

Tom Hanks is cast as a father who is deeply committed to his 9-year old son.  The son, brilliantly played by young Thomas Horn, who may or may not have Asperger's Syndrome, is extremely intelligent although afraid of such things as going on a swing in the park.  His father spends a lot of time with the boy and is committed to educating him.  The boy thrives on this.  And then, suddenly, the date is September 11, 2001 and the father is at a meeting on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center and makes several panicky calls home which get recorded on voice mail.  Sandra Bullock plays the mother in a heart rendering role.  She and her son have never been close and the boy resents her even though she deeply loves him and does her best to get him through the hard time he is having.

One day the boy finds a key in his father's closet.  It is in a small brown envelope with the word ""Black"" on it.  The boy assumes that this must be a person with the last name of Black and then sets out on a voyage of discovery to visit every single one of the 472 people in New York City with the last name of Black.  Soon he is joined by an old man in his eighties, played by Max Von Sydow who doesn't speak and who communicates through writing on a notepad..  Together they travel the city and there are a few humorous and heartfelt moments between them.  Eventually the boy does discover the truth about the key although it is not what he expected.

There were a few problems with this film in general.  How can such a young boy be permitted to travel around the city alone? Where was the mother?  Eventually, in an emotional conclusion demonstrating fine acting by Sandra Bullock, we do find out but it's hard to believe that the plot could have really happened this way.

Clearly, this is the saddest film I have ever seen and I will long remember it with tears in my eyes.  That is why I just stop short of giving it my highest recommendation. I do not want to recommend it only because I know it will make everyone who sees this film sad too.  And there surely is enough sadness in this world already.",1324857600,12,2447,4.232758620689655

Additionally, an excellent portrayal of a young boy who was already very different from his peers before his father died, and he was not labeled with a psychiatric condition before or after the trauma of losing his father. Sad to say, many kids with his behavior would be at risk of being put on psychiatric medication and thus on a path to drug dependency and other negative consequences (see Robert Whitaker, Anatomy of an Epidemic, chapters 11 and 12 for more information).",1469836800,,575,5.063157894736842

5059909,5,B0077ATSU4,"I saw an incredible film tonight, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" after the novel by the brilliant Jonathan Saffran Foer, and directed by Stephen Daldry. The ideal cast includes Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock (stripped of make-up and her usual pep-squad persona), Max von Sydow (protagonist of so many of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces), Viola Davis, and New Orleans resident John Goodman.

Thomas Horn, as the young hero, is a real find, with the legendary Zoe Caldwell (who, having seen her Euripides ""Medea,"" could forget the event?) as his grandmother. The disaster of 9/11 is the point of departure for a strange examination of our lives. The work also, for this reviewer, highlights the fact that, as difficult as it is to deal with death, to do so without religious faith is a catastrophe.

5059923,2,B0077ATSU4,"It started out well, then I realized it was about the worst day of everyone's life 9/11.  Then everything just went downhill from there.  The child is beyond strange, mentally he needs major help, he likes to cut himself.  He spoke incessantly, on the verge of complete madness.  He held so much in, and yet just wasn't normal by any means.  This movie will drive you nuts watching it unfold. This movie is NOT for KIDS to watch either! The kid will also drive you nuts watching it.  You want him in a mental hospital to get help.  From what has happened to his family and also what is wrong with him in general.  He just takes off running out of the house whenever he wants to day and night....without even telling his mom in the middle of NYC, it was complete madness. What child goes running around NY at all hours by himself shaking a tambourine too (yep another one of his very strange ways, you'll see if you must watch this garbage movie)? He takes pictures off the internet of people falling out of the World Trade Center and blowing up the images to make them larger printed photos wondering if it's his dad-it was sick, pictures of people falling to their deaths.  The day this happened was real, this story isn't, it took what was a very horrific sad day for millions of people and written by some twisted mind and made into a movie.  We all will never forget that day.  But forget buying this movie, please, it is one you don't want to own or ever see again.  It's a SICKENING story.  If this is the author's idea of some tribute to all the people lost to 9/11, it was all in very poor taste & not a tribute.

I am dearly acquainted with several people on the autism spectrum...and they just don't turn it on and off like this character does. When he's exhibiting symptoms he's very convincing...but sometimes he's not at all, maybe because it was getting in the way of the pacing.  Bonus: Sandra Bullock's character has more depth than it appears at first, and she becomes a pleasure to watch by the end.

I lived in New York City during the early 1960s, and I do love some movies taking place in New York City, such as, AS GOOD AS IT GETS or 13 GOING ON 33 or BIG starring Hanks or ON THE TOWN or the first third of KING KONG starring Jack Black.  On the other hand, after 30 minutes of watching EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, it became apparent that it was some sort of experimental film, where the goal of the scriptwriter and director was to determine how much irrational plot line elements could be strung together, before provoking in the viewer an overwhelming sense of tedium.  The weirdness of the non-sequiturs, which come at a steady pace, is not what most annoyed me the most.  What annoyed me the most is the cutesy nature of the non-sequiturs.  The tone of the movie is like that of the singing crows in the Disney cartoon, DUMBO.  The crows know that it is only a cartoon, and so the crows go ahead and do things that can only happen in cartoons.  That is how the logic goes in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE.  There are some people who do enjoy experimental theater, such as WAITING FOR GODOT, where weird and contrived things happen at a steady pace.  But I am not one of these people.

Here is one example of the movie being overly cute.  The boy in the story derives an analogy between light coming from the sun and reaching the earth, and the consequences of the sun suddenly switching off.  The result is that the earth would be bathed with light and heat for eight more minutes, and then this would come to a sudden halt.  The analogy that the boy raises, is that his relationship with his deceased father is traveling along the same limited course of ""borrowed time.""  Before the father's tragic end, the father got the boy interested in the possibility that New York City once had a sixth burrough, and that the clues to this sixth burrough resided in various places, for example, in Central Park.  The boy finds a clue of his own, namely a key in an envelope with the word ""black"" written on it.  Again and again, the boy talks about the analogy of the eight minutes of borrowed time.  I think that once is enough.  The boy arrives at the notion that  the word ""black"" on it means that a person named ""Black"" who lives somewhere in New York City, knows the purpose of the key.  The boy then gets the addresses of all of the people named ""Black"" in New York City, and sets off on the goal of visiting them all in person, one by one.  This sort of decision tree can reasonably be characterized as lacking in any reason and sense.  The over-use of the eight minutes analogy, and the decision to visit all people in New York City named ""Black"" makes this movie one of the least compelling films that I've seen in the past ten years.  Yuck.

The concept of the eight minutes of borrowed time, is like something a 20-year old drama student think up for an experimental play.  The idea that a key in an envelope labeled ""Black"" should lead to the decision to visit all of the people in New York City named ""Black"" is like something a 20-year old drama student should think up for an experimental play.  This movie has one idea after another of this type  --  ideas that might seem brilliant and compelling to a 20-year old drama student and to his friends (or to her friends), but where ultimately, it was decided that the ideas were too cutesy, too contrived, too boring, and too stupid for including in a real drama or in a real film script. Icky, icky, yuck!",1437436800,2,3789,4.40863309352518

5060001,3,B0077ATSU4,"Understand my reasons for allotting 2011's ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" the final score I did.  I'd give it a 5/5 for having its heart in the right place; a 4/5 for stretching that heart almost to the breaking point with its gushy sentimentality; a 3/5 for checking reason and logic at the door; and a 2/5 for exploiting the 9/11 tragedy for purely fictional, commercial, melodramatic purposes. My 3/5 final rating is an average of all those scores.

Marking the tenth anniversary of the horrendous September 11, 2001 attacks on New York's Twin Towers, Hollywood seemed bound to weigh in with at least one more major motion picture on the subject.  This one appeared at first glance to have a lot going for it:  Two huge stars in Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock; a slew of important actors in Max von Sydow, Viola Davis, John Goodman, and Jeffrey Wright; a newcomer in Thomas Horn; a screenplay by Eric Roth (""Forrest Gump,"" ""Ali,"" ""The Insider,"" ""Munich,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") based on a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer; and director Stephen Daldry (""Billy Eliott,"" ""The Hours,"" ""The Reader"").  Still, 9/11 may have been a subject rehashed too many times already for any movie to say something new or meaningful about it, even in so earnest a manner as in this film.  As a result, the film is a disappointment.

The story is easy enough to follow, even with its convoluted premise, and it works well enough if you don't think much about it.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers want viewers to take the movie quite seriously, so they almost force one to examine the drama minutely, and the story doesn't hold up.

The main character is a young boy of indeterminate age (the novel says he's nine but the actor playing the part is about twelve or thirteen) named Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn).  He lives in New York City with his parents, played by Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock.  They are portrayed as ideal parents, ""Father Knows Best"" parents.  I mean, what kid wouldn't want Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock as his parents?  Anyway, the father, a jeweler, plays a game with his son whenever he can, a guessing game called ""Reconnaissance Expedition"" where the father places clues around the city for the boy to find and figure out.  It not only helps the boy and his father to bond, it helps with the boy's psychological problems.  You see, he appears to be autistic; he's brilliant but has emotional issues, leaving him rigid, uncommunicative, scared, and detached.  He describes himself as ""odd.""

During the 9/11 attacks, Oskar's father is at a meeting on one of the top floors of the World Trade Center and dies in the catastrophe.  Oskar is understandably devastated.  Then, a year after the father's death, Oskar finds a key in a vase tucked away on the top of his father's closet, the key inside an envelope marked ""Black.""  Oskar figures it was a final game his father left him to decipher, and he decides to solve it or else.  He thinks it's a ""special key"" and wants to find out what it unlocks.  Of course, we recognize immediately that it's not just a real key but a metaphorical key as well, a key to keeping his father with him a little longer, a key to Oskar's finding himself, a key to unlocking the beauty and mystery of the world.  Or some such high-sounding themes.  Oskar keeps a journal of his new, perhaps final, ""Reconnaissance Expedition,"" titling it ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" and determining ""never to stop looking, ever.""

Oskar resolves to visit every person named ""Black"" in the city, over four hundred of them, and question them about the key.  During his expeditions each weekend, he encounters an assortment of New Yorkers, his relentless search and the people he meets making up the plot and action of the movie.

Now, here's the thing:  Oskar is in almost every scene, and you'll probably either like Thomas Horn's acting (the Broadcast Film Critics Association gave him their Critics Choice Movie Award for Best Young Actor/Actress for the role) or find his character annoying.  The filmmakers chose a first-time actor in Thomas Horn, discovering him on a ""Jeopardy"" game show.  The movie intends for the boy's character to be unusual, but after a while, his cold, unresponsive, often insulting personality becomes irritating, even grating.

And it doesn't help that in order apparently to provide the story more gravitas, the film moves at the pace of a Greenland glacier.

Flashbacks to the day of 9/11 fill in the details of the events and how they immediately affected Oskar and his family.  The characters Oskar (and we) meet through his quest include his grandmother (Zoe Caldwell), who lives across the street from the boy and with whom Oskar feels most comfortable.  There's a reclusive old man (Max von Sydow) known only as ""The Renter"" who lets a room from the grandmother and who agrees to help Oskar with his search, perhaps to help him face his fears.  The Renter doesn't want to or cannot speak, writing out his responses on paper.  I'm sure there must be some profound symbolism at work here, but it escapes me.  There is Stan the doorman (John Goodman), whom Oskar treats with continuous and inexplicable contempt.  There are Abby (Viola Davis) and William (Jeffrey Wright) Black, a newly divorced couple; and many others.  Each has his or her own sad story to tell.

By the time the movie ends, which it never appears to want to do, incidentally, it seems more than a little improbable.  When it was finally over, I found myself not just disappointed, but a little annoyed.  It was like, what?  That makes no sense.  What are the odds any of that could happen?  Indeed, little in the film makes any logical sense once the story unfolds and presents its revelations.  Frankly, by the time it does conclude, it seems more than a little like a cheat.

Video:
The filmmakers chose to shoot the movie digitally with an Arri Alexa digital camera, and even though I have never been a fan of digital shooting, I must admit this is the best digitally shot film I've yet seen.  What's more, the Warner engineers did a good job transferring it to Blu-ray using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC codec.

The colors are vivid, with facial tones as natural looking as one could want.  The overall image is a touch glassy yet displays excellent definition and detailing.  It only real drawback is that it can appear too good, too well defined, too icy cold in its preciseness and clarity to seem entirely real; and it looks a tad flat rather than dimensional.  Still, it is, as I say, quite beautiful, the equal of most movies shot on conventional film stock.

Audio:
The movie is primarily dialogue driven, so there isn't always a lot for the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound reproduction to do beyond render a clean, clear, lifelike midrange.  It handles the situation with ease, along with providing a wide stereo spread, strong bass, good musical ambient effects, and a few environment noises in the surrounds like those from trains and crowds.

Extras:
The Blu-ray disc in this two-disc Combo Pack contains four bonus featurettes.  The first is ""Making Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" about twenty minutes with the filmmakers and the stars.  The second is ""Finding Oskar,"" eight minutes on the young actor the filmmakers found to play the lead character.  The third is ""Ten Years Later,"" eleven minutes with New Yorkers and their stories a decade after the attacks.  And the fourth featurette is ""Max von Sydow:  Dialogues with the Renter,"" forty-four minutes with the actor on location.

The extras on disc one conclude with fourteen scene selections; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; Spanish and other subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two, a DVD, contains a standard-definition version of the movie.  In addition, the Combo Pack includes an UltraViolet Digital Copy, which ""allows you to stream via Wi-Fi and download to your computer and compatible iPhone touch and iPad devices.""  The redemption code expires March 27, 2014.  The two discs come packaged in a flimsy Eco-case, the case further enclosed in a light-cardboard slipcover.

Parting Shots:
The 9/11 attacks affected thousands of lives:  the victims, the families, the friends, the nation, and the world.  Replaying one improbable fictional story doesn't do a lot to clarify, amplify, or penetrate the nature of the catastrophe.  ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" seems more than anything else like an excuse to capitalize on the event in order to tug at our heartstrings.  The filmmakers clearly want us to sympathize with the movie's young protagonist, but giving him such burdensome psychological problems that his demeanor becomes annoying only serves to distance him and the story from us further.",1433203200,,8784,4.856854838709677

5060101,4,B0077ATSU4,"Not what you might expect from a 9/11 rumination piece. Somehow it manages to come off as both intensely personal and strangely universal. Superstars Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock share the top billing, but their screen time is quite narrow and limited in favor of a stiff, appropriately awkward pre-teen, who struggles for years to find a deeper meaning behind his father's sudden demise inside the towers. In that role, Thomas Horn (in his first-ever dramatic appearance) is cloudy, conflicted and heart-wrenchingly real. Prone to fits of sudden anger and misdirected violence, he never seems selfish or misguided in doing so - a tricky feat for such an inexperienced actor. This is a film about trying to piece together a shattered vase without the benefit of adhesive. It's about survivor's guilt, the emotional distance and self-doubt of adolescence and the profound emptiness of a meaningful loss, but while it's often deep, dark and somber, that sense never threatens to engulf us. The boy's father had a light-hearted zest for life that pulses well beyond his own mortality, and his playful spirit lends color and passion to what could have otherwise (quite easily) become an emotional drag. A spirited, hearty journey that bears a loud spectrum of emotions, and stops just short of exploiting the national tragedy it revolves around.",1417651200,2,1341,5.127853881278539

Thomas Horn is perfect for the role. So is Max von Sydow. The story travels into the land of your heart. But the journey is more unique then the actual traveling. A few tosses we were prepared for, but not the big toss... comes at the very end. We had to yell at the screen a few times but the toss definitely helped. And, the inclusion of John Goodman also helped. Thomas Horn kind of reminded us of Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone, he ran the show. He was the show.

5060168,3,B0077ATSU4,"The acting was good, it got tears from me in the end, it kept my attention; but the subject matter was heavy.

A boy about 10 has a wonderful father, which is great because he seems to be perhaps an Asperger's child. The boy is bright, but has some challenges socially and a good deal of social anxiety.  His father realizing this has created games geared to help his child move into the world and be able to function, and these games seem worth doing for any child. Then the father dies.

The rest of the movie is flashbacks to when the father was alive, and the child trying to come to terms with his father's death. Trying to make sense of it all. Which we all know, there often is no sense in the bad things that happen...and no special ending is given here. But in the movie, we see:
the reason behind the ""good father's"" motivation to be good...his own father deserting the family
an extremely GREAT grandmother helping the family
a mother trying to cope and love a challenging child, and she is in part depicted as a person also, not just a parent
we see an example of a well functioning, mature behaving, family system (I am always looking for examples of this to try out)
an imperfect grandfather, trying to redeem himself and kindness towards him demonstrated

ALL very good things, and probably helpful for a therapy film; but I was just looking for a fun movie to watch. So though I think it is worthwhile and I may suggest others especially those needing some good role modeling during stressful times watch it..It was just OK for me.",1409097600,3,1547,4.455830388692579

Didn't quite get the grandmother's role and the grandfather just got tiresome for me.  The kid's tirades, while acted well, were too over-the-top and they made me almost panicky - to the point that I had to mute the scenes.  9-11 was horrendous and although you can't ""sugar-coat"" actual events, I think this movie gave too much information to the viewers with this movie's part of the tragedy.

5060268,5,B0077ATSU4,"As a licensed mental health counselor this movie, from my perspective, could be used therapeutically to help families reflect on how hiddenness and shame affect children during family crisis. The parallel stories are powerful in revealing how each person's individual experience could be so drastically changed if they *knew* the whole story. That's the power of being known, the freedom of allowing yourself to trust others with what really scares you about yourself. The boy in the story shares his world with his grandfather who is selectively mute due to his own trauma. The boy is able to let it all go with his grandfather and the healing is so powerful! People, even kids, just need to be heard-not told what to do or what to feel or think-just heard and they will find their way out of the dark pit and into the light of healing.",1391385600,,837,4.700680272108843

Oskar comes across a key in his closet in an envelope with the name Black and Oskar travels all over NYC trying to find the person named Black.

5060294,5,B0077ATSU4,"I really loved this movie. There's a bunch of little things to convey emotion without explicitly saying what needs to be said. It's really the perfect way to capture the impact of the event. Not at all like some of the things out there that have tried to capitalize on it or use it as cheap emotional gut wrencher, like in Remember Me. When I watched it and was paying attention to all the little things that had so much to say I though the controlling nature, exceptional memory, and social difficulty of the boy was an indication of Asperger's, but he seemed sociable and emotional enough to fall just outside the diagnosis. Now that I know the kid has Asperger's, I think this is even better because it gives me a new view of Asperger's. I've watched Parenthood and thought that the kid on that show was a jerk. I realize it was a part of his condition, but sometimes excuses for his behavior can only be stretched so far before you give up. House didn't help give a second perspective to Asperger's either since House is a jerk too. It also doesn't help that people eagerly assign the condition to previous historical figures that were slightly rude introverts. This movie does so much by focusing on the person and not the disease. It does the same for the event. The great impact can be felt without words. I think the real reason I love this movie so much is because the boy was the same age as I was when it all happened and since it was so far from me I couldn't understand what it all meant or how to feel about it. I felt nothing, probably because I stupidly didn't think there were people in the buildings when I first saw them fall. I was also a slightly rude introverted exploring kid. I first watched this when it came out during a time when I couldn't feel anything and became so disinterested in anything that I would skip through every movie to figure out the plot in 5 minutes. This was the only movie I didn't skip through. It has made me realize what others must have felt on that day, and I can now go away from it seeing a person with Asperger's as a relatable person and not just as a person with Asperger's. I must be sap for saying all this, but I really love this movie.",1388448000,,2197,4.309178743961352

5060301,1,B0077ATSU4,"Controlling tone is difficult in a film. Most films fail to esteem themselves beyond the satisfaction offered with character and plotting, which equates to often seeing movies, enjoying them to some extent, and then forgetting them gradually.

Every now and then a film comes out that's so unintentionally caustic, so ham-fistedly confrontational with the audience that the memory remains inescapably bad. In such a fashion emerges this little ditty built around the constraint of a child trying to reconnect with his dead father by ""solving"" a puzzle around the events of the 9/11 attack. Such a conceit could work, I don't dismiss this film as being exploitative in the same fashion that, say, ""The Blind Side"" comes off, but there is something going on here that ends up feeling much, much worse. The tone surges wildly out of the director's control more often than not, making viewing ""Extremely Loud"" a real chore to sit through. In turns shrill and sappy, at no point does the melodrama fit the scene. The clumsy symbolism finds its equal in pop radio confections, not serious films, yet the film is (perhaps pretentiously) attempting to do ""something serious.""

One may be able to excuse this film as a noble failure, but I don't know anyone who actually enjoyed it. After-school specials and product-hocking cartoons work better than this eye-trap. It's a film so rare as to, in an inverted, Ed-Wood-kind-of way, actually merit viewing. The ordeal will definitely teach a viewer how not to control tone in a movie, and in that manner, I say thanks for the lesson.  If you actually seek to enjoy a film, I suggest you give this over-hyped and under-thought piece of derring-do a wide berth. But then, I could be wrong. Maybe the whole terrorist attack can best be summed up with the images of a boy collecting trinkets and yelling into the camera....",1386806400,3,1857,4.888888888888889

5060309,4,B0077ATSU4,"It takes a very special kind of child actor to carry a heavy dramatic film like EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE.  While Thomas Horn presents an often petulant, quirky Oskar, nonetheless this preteen has exceptional screen presence as a grieving youth on a search to somehow connect with his father (Tom Hanks, who appears throughout the film in flashbacks), who died in one of the Twin Towers during 9/11.  It quickly becomes readily apparent that Oskar had a very close relationship with Thomas, his father, and that Thomas would challenge his son via word games and father/son excursions in Manhattan to broaden the youth's horizons.  The vacuum in Oskar's life is literally unbearable, a vacuum Oskar's mother (Sandra Bullock), to her chagrin, can't ease, and it is only when Oskar finds a mysterious key in a blue vase in his parents' closet that draws him out of his malaise to search New York to find out what door the key unlocks--and perhaps find a message from Thomas.  It appears to be an impossible task, and Oskar grows increasingly frustrated, but there is ultimately a less-than-satisfying payoff.

Again, Thomas Horn is an exceptional talent; the pain and anguish his character is experiencing throughout this film is powerful and unflinching.  Bullock and Hanks turn in solid performances--especially Bullock as the film begins to conclude.  But what a second tier of characters!  Max von Sydow is terrific as a mute tenant of Oskar's grandmother who accompanies the boy during his search.  The veteran actor doesn't have a single line, yet the performance he conveys via his facial expressions is astounding.  John Goodman just keeps getting better and better, and here he doesn't disappoint as the doorman of the building where Oskar lives.  And Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are extremely believable as an estranged couple--the first people Oskar visits as he begins his search.  The secret of the key less than satisfies, and the message under the swing seat firmly tweaks suspension of disbelief, but when it comes to a powerful drama that will take your breath away (Thomas's phone messages the morning of 9/11 are stunning examples) and have you wiping away tears, EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE is without peer.

Do not waste your time looking for a story, hoping for excellent dialogue and acting, or searching for even one character to care about. This ponderous film has none of those.

I agree with every reviewer who said this was an emotionless exploitation of 9/11. It's merely a disjointed and preposterous story about an obnoxious boy who is on the screen eighty-five percent of the time, a clueless mother, an inexplicably mute grandfather, and a grandmother the child communicates with from his window to hers.

It also shows how even a really wonderful parent grieves and the relationship with a child during the healing process.  It highlights relationships of grandparents and strangers who can play an important role in the healing process.  A sad story that could help others understand their emotions during a similar loss.

5060356,5,B0077ATSU4,"This is one of my favorite movies. With Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks starring, the story begins in New York during the events of 9/11. Rather than being a movie about despair and hopelessness, this movie is one of unique vision. Each character has a distinct personality rarely seen in most movies. This movie is based on a book by Jonathan Foer. I have also read the book and it was even better than the movie, with drawings, photographs that were in the main characters' , Oskar Schell's journals. I recommend reading the book and viewing the movie. In which order is entirely up to you. During the movie, I wanted so much to be a fly on the wall , to see inside Oskar's journals and scoot under his bed with him. In the book, you can. I will watch the movie and read the book over and over again; a rarity in any medium. Never is the movie as good as the book. In this case it isn't but it sure is close...until we can enter the movie itself and see from all angles...more than 3D that is. That is what imagination is for and why we read.",1370476800,,1041,4.21

I regret  not being  as dedicated  as  this child was.  I  was  rescued  by  sandra  when she explained about  knowing what the boy  had  done  and how she was able to let him go about his research  following  but  not  interfering. and then the  twist  of  it not  being  what  the boy thought it was,  and yet  acceptable.

5060358,5,B0077ATSU4,"When I started watching this movie, I didn't know it had any connection to 9/11.  I've tried for years not to watch movies related to that day because it makes me, well, extremely angry and incredibly sad.  If I could expunge every trace of religion from the brains of every human being and the tribulation it has wreaked upon civilization, and replace it with compassion, sanity, and reason, then I would do so.

This movie is about the after effects of that kind of fanaticism, this time 9/11, on one family with a special child.  It made an extremely interesting and incredibly emotional story and is a fine movie.  Well, Tom Hanks is a part of it, so of course it is.  Sandra Bullock is really good as the mother and Max Von Sydow is the master. And how they get a young kid to act like that is simply a mystery.  But if you have any heart at all, you will enjoy this one.",1369785600,,876,4.2727272727272725
5060359,5,B0077ATSU4,This movie I have watched with my children--hoping that they see how important it is to talk to and mentor our children--even preparing them to be strong during conflict.,1369785600,,170,4.896551724137931
5060360,5,B0077ATSU4,"The only movie publicity we see these days is for silly, noisy movies made from comic books. So this one slipped right past me until recently. If you're past the raging hormone stage of life, you'll find this immensely satisfying. Oskar, a bright boy with probable Aspergers, loses his father in the 9/11 attack.  He finds a key among his father's possessions and begins a quest to find the lock.  He's more than smart enough to invent a feasible plan, but he has no ability to handle the deep emotional scars left by his father's death.

As great as this story is, this movie isn't about plot so much as it's about people and the way they treat each other.  The part of Oskar is taken by first-timer Thomas Horn, and I've never seen a better performance by a young person. He brings both vulnerability and the focused ability to irritate that so many Asperger's kids must learn to handle.  Every part, large or small, is perfectly cast.  From Sandra Bullock's distraught mother (with a surprise of her own) to John Goodman's doorman to Jeffrey Wright's estranged husband, this film is pitch-perfect.  It's impossible to watch without your own emotional response, but it doesn't feel manipulative.  With news crews finally moved on to the next tragedy, we're able to see the blow that 9/11 was to New Yorkers.  I couldn't help but think of the many families who are still dealing with the giant holes this left in their lives.

Find a couple of quiet hours and watch this film through.  It's both sobering and satisfying.",1369008000,,1521,4.680451127819549

5060378,3,B0077ATSU4,"Pros: I don't know if I've mentioned this to you, but I'm kind of a big Tom Hanks fan. In the world of cinema, I'm pretty confident that a better actor cannot be found currently or in the past. And for another one of his caliber to come along in the future would simply be super awesome. Almost like the Second Coming of Christ, but without any of the sacrilege a comparison like that might normally imply. Accordingly, I spent much of the movie hoping for Mr. Hanks to pop back up on the screen, so that I could cry some more about the fact that he was dead (that's a spoiler only if you know absolutely nothing about the movie, by the way). This wasn't necessarily Hanks' best work, but I'm not going to complain about any opportunity to see him strut his stuff on the silver screen. Especially when he's providing me with an excellent parental role model, whereby his primary function in life appeared to be blatantly lying to his son in a playful sort of ""I'm going to fill my kid's head with so many stupid little factual inaccuracies that he's going to have a complex when he's older"" way.

Oskar Schell is the most eloquent child in the world. He speaks every line as though he's a thirty year old Shakespearean actor, instead of the ineffectually speaking ten year old that he ought to be. It's really important to me to be able to watch a movie and understand what it is that the characters are saying to me. That is, if there's talking at all. Some movies this year just sidestepped that problem completely. So anyway, it was nice that, quite unbelievably, a small child was able to deliver each of his lines in a manner that I could both hear and understand. In the emotionally raw reality of this movie, you have a little boy able to deliver lines in a very straight laced, non-speech-impeded, discernible manner. Wait a second...

Cons: Oskar Schell is the most eloquent child in the world. He speaks every line as though he's a thirty year old Shakespearean actor, instead of the ineffectually speaking ten year old that he ought to be. Why in the world does he speak so clearly? It's actually kinda creepy. And eventually very much wore on my nerves. I suppose it fit his character as some sort of improperly undiagnosed Asperger's-affected boy, but that's honestly not really the kind of character with whom I'm prone to identify.

I also couldn't identify with his motivation through the course of the movie. I've never particularly struggled with death, but that's most likely some sort of character flaw of my own, and I've also never had to go through the loss of, say, the only person in the world with whom I share some sort of bond. Or even the loss of a parent, for that matter. I'll count myself lucky on that front, obviously, and I will momentarily admit that I actually do remember ""The Worst Day"" and didn't find myself immune to the emotional effects of the movie.

Overall: Anyway, when I was able to take myself out of the fairly brow-beating sentiment of the movie and think about it objectively, it didn't necessarily strike me as well done or as eloquent as the boy himself. I think most of the effect of the movie just comes from the ability of nearly every audience member being able to identify with either losing a parent or with the horrific events of 9/11 itself. Or both. And it seemed to cash in fairly ruthlessly on those two things, almost using the crying version of a laugh track, indicating to the audience when they ought to choke up. *Cue double-emotion-whammy Tom-Hanks-as-Falling-Man flashback as I, with teary eyes, give the movie a 6 out of 10.*",1362873600,,3599,4.549382716049383

There are so many wonderful subplots going on as in life. It's amazing acting and very touching acting by all the actors. The key he finds leads him into a need to solve it's mystery that takes him all over New York and occupies him as he begins to learn about people more than more adults ever learn. That life is a mystery locked and we must find a key that makes the time passing meaningful. To think that every family is experiencing this kind of trauma was the hardest part for me to grasp.

5060395,3,B0077ATSU4,"There is an old adage that tells us that a recipe can only be as good as the ingredients that are used.  If that is true, consider the Oscar-nominated Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. It begins with director Stephen Daldry, a man so narratively gifted that all three of his previous films have gone on to earn ""Best Picture"" nominations.  To that, you add the two-time, Academy Award-winning actor, Tom Hanks, in the role of a saintly father who may be the only person on earth who understands his uniquely challenged son.  Now mix in Sandra Bullock, just two years removed from her own Oscar-winning performance, as a bereaved mother left to deal with her own grief, even as she struggles to help her son come to grips with his loss.  Finally, take all these ingredients and set them in the context of the ""jumpers"" leaping from the burning towers on September 11th.  What should emerge from the oven is a scintillating film that finally gives voice to our collective grief and rage.  But, unfortunately, this is not the case.  Indeed, there are two critical weaknesses that take the legs right out from underneath this film and ultimately prevent it from becoming anything more than an overly-saccharine sympathy card that leaves nothing but a bad aftertaste in your mouth.

So what are the issues?  Well, the first problem has to do with the adaptation of the source material itself.  In fairness to Eric Roth, anytime a screenwriter has to distill the content of a novel down to a script that can be filmed in two hours, material is going to be sacrificed.  But in this case, many of Jonathan Safran Foer's most insightful musings on the nature of war and terror have been left on the editing room floor.  In the novel, the only reason the grandfather re-emerges into the life of this scarred young boy is because he, too, knows what it means to lose a parent to the ever-turning gears of war.  But here, in the film, the fire-bombings of Dresden during World War II are used only as a set up to explain the grandfather's selectively mute nature.  Thus, the larger theme of war and its impact on the lives of the innocent is almost completely absent.  And that is a very real problem when you are attempting to say something of value on the subject of 9/11. If you do ultimately decide to see this film, ask yourself this: how would the film have been substantially changed if Oskar's father did not die in the attacks of 9/11, but in a random car accident that left him with just enough time to place a few phone calls?  If you believe, as I do, that nothing would have functionally changed, than you will begin to see the central problem with the film.  To reduce the events of September 11th to nothing more than a plot device that allows a character to grow is to fundamentally disrespect the nearly 3000 people that lost their lives on that day in history.

The second major issue with this film has to do with the casting of young Thomas Horn.  For some inexplicable reason, director Stephen Daldry made the decision to cast a complete unknown in the role of Oskar Schell.  Prior to this film, Horn had never acted either in film or in television; and that is a massive liability for a film in which the young actor is required to play an emotionally shattered boy who is likely suffering from the effects of Asperger's Syndrome as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Yes, every once in a while, a Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense comes along to take us all by surprise.  But that is the exception and not the rule.

So where does Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close sit in the pantheon of 9/11 films?  Probably somewhere beneath Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, and just above Adam Sandler's Reign Over Me.  At best, it's an adequate film that leaves the viewer wondering: is it just too soon to expect a film to really be able to handle the events of that day?

5060398,3,B0077ATSU4,"In many ways this movie succeeds. It creates a sophisticated and often moving portrayal of a precocious and anxious boy, whose dad's died during 9/11. The problems come in more at the margins. For instance, the Dad is a bit too perfect and the  adventures/quest he takes on is largely implausible--or at least unrealistic. That said, those can be lived with; this is fiction after all. But I think my biggest problems came from the child actor. Overall, he was very impressive. His performance was nuanced and sophisticated, but there were still times when it didn't quite work. When his acting felt wooden. And those moments combined with the other two issues just mentioned, detracted a bit too much for me. That said, I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it.",1358380800,,765,4.884615384615385

The movie is long, boring and drags out with no redeeming moral at the end, which I was hoping for and pretty much the only reason I finished watching.

5060405,5,B0077ATSU4,"Without a doubt, this is one of the most amazing films I've seen this decade, if not ever! In all my years, I don't think I've ever seen something that deals with the loss of a parent in such an honest way. Yes, even though the bulk of the story kind of comes across like a fairy tale, the themes it deals with and how they are handled are some of the most realistic I've ever seen committed to film.

I remember being excited to see this when it came out, and the wait was well worthwhile. Unlike another kind of similar tale about a youth's search for meaning in the midst of life's turmoils that I was excited to see when it came out, but ended up being disappointed with, ""Where The Wild Things Are"", I felt there was never a moment in this that wasn't just extremely brilliant and beautiful and moving.

Being someone who lost my father a few years ago (he died unexpectedly of a heart attack), I relate to everything Oskar went through emotionally in this film, as I'm sure anyone else who's lost a parent will do. I felt this movie captured all the raw emotions and feelings that a person experiences after such a great loss, ranging from grief, anger, confusion, anger, feelings of euphoria from lack of sleep, anger, to even assessing blame on the surving parent.

I was also very moved by the way the film dealt with generational themes, depicted beautifully between Oskar and the tenant in his grandmother's house (Max Von Sydow). The endurance of learning self respect and love and respect for others passed on from one generation to the next was so wonderfully depicted.

Sorry, but I'm not going to go into plot scenarios here. If you want that, read someone else's review. I feel the plot has been disussed enough in so many other well written reviews. What I'm trying to share here is my experience and emotions while wathing the film. This is something that made me weep unabashedly, and I'm not ashamed to admit that. Yes, this is a deeply moving film, and even has some very depressing moments, but it is not an overall depressing film; and it also has some very magnificent enlightening moments, capturing the beautiful bonds of family relationships that will just take your breath away.

And let me just say that the acting from the cast in this is some of the best I've ever seen from any of them. I honestly don't think I've ever seen better work from any of them before. Why the Academy didn't recognize their work in this is beyond me.

As you can already probably guess, I HIGHLY recommend this movie! Thank you. :>)

5060413,4,B0077ATSU4,"I purchased this movie for $9.99 eight months ago and I had not felt interested to watch it until the other day. I was pleasantly surprised.

While the critics were fairly right about the slow, depressing and difficult film style, they left out that the movie is extremely realistic and very touching. It is not a big Hollywood movie that cost a lot to make or broke box office records. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was going more for a subtle emotional connection with its viewer.

This is not a movie about 9-11. It is a incident which the movie revolves around, however over-all it is not the main point of the film. This movie is about the love and connection between a father and son and the need for that connection to last after someone has passed on.

The directing is top notch and the movie has a very artsy-indie creative feel to it. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and he does have a large role in this film as there are many flash backs. The son played by Thomas Horn does a fantastic job and his little nervous ticks and reactions are phenomenally portrayed.

After finally getting up enough momentum to watch this movie, I will keep it in my collection and watch it again one day. It is touching and I did tear up a little throughout the film as the emotion of the son and the blunt reality and realism was outstanding.

The story starts out providing a brief glimpse of the relationship between young Oskar Schnell and his father Thomas. Thomas was unfortunate enough to be in the World Trade Center during the ""worst day"", leaving Oskar and his mom to deal with the loss of their loved one.

One day while going through his dad's things, Oskar accidentally breaks a vase and finds a key inside of an envelope labelled ""Black"". He makes it his mission to find out what or who the key belongs in/to. His journey takes him all over New York. He walks to all of his locations due to his fear of public transportation.

This movie is a definite tear jerker, putting you front and center at one of the worst events in recent US history. There are times when it is so deep and insightful that you can't help but be moved by it. Even though it starts out as a search to connect more with his father, Oskar ends up finding himself and extended family members along the way.

5060427,4,B0077ATSU4,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a memorable film that moved me greatly. On the surface the story uses the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks to advance the story but the film is much more about coping with the loss of a loved one; and it's all beautifully done. The acting was incredibly good; I was amazed at how brilliantly young Thomas Horn essentially carries the entire movie being supported by some of the best actors today--Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Max von Sydow, Zoe Caldwell, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright and others! The cinematography and choreography reflect great forethought and the musical score enhances the film quite a bit.

We first see how Thomas Schell, a jeweler (Tom Hanks) loves to play with his son Oskar (Thomas Horn), a troubled kid who might have Asperger's Syndrome (at one point Oskar says his test results for Asperger's were inconclusive). Thomas plays with Oskar so that Oskar can build self-confidence and get over his fears which are many--including swing sets! In particular, Oskar likes to go on scavenger hunts that his father Thomas sets up for him; there's even one scavenger hunt to find the fictional sixth borough of New York City that turns out to be extremely meaningful. Tragically, Thomas is killed on September 11th in the attacks on The World Trade Center. This leaves vulnerable young Oskar tormented and his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) doesn't know what to do to make her son happy again as she herself looks for ways to cope with life without her husband.

One year later, Oskar goes through his father's closet and accidentally breaks a blue vase; inside the vase is a key is in a small manila envelope and the work ""Black"" is written on the envelope. Oskar thinks this may be one last way he can re-connect with his father; perhaps his father was going to send him on a scavenger hunt mission to find something somewhere and that the word ""Black"" was the only clue. Oskar starts by finding every person with the last name of ""Black"" in the five boroughs of New York City; this is a formidable challenge. Oskar tries to systematically find all the ""Blacks"" with fascinating results.

Now of course many people will comment on how young Oskar is allowed by his mother to simply roam the streets unaccompanied until a mysterious elderly man (Max von Sydow) who rents a room from his grandmother (Zoe Caldwell) helps Oskar search; this is understandable because it simply isn't very believable. It's also hard to understand how such a young boy could walk (Oskar's afraid of subway trains) from Manhattan to Brooklyn and be the only person walking on a major bridge walkway.

However, if you can look past these implausible parts of the plot, this is one powerful film and I won't tell you much more to avoid giving you spoilers! I left out some of the plot already and there's plenty more you will discover for yourself. Rest assured that the last half-hour of the film is unbelievably poignant; it's enough to make a stone cry!

Look for more great performances by John Goodman as Stan the doorman; Hazelle Goodman as Hazel Black and cameos by Jim Norton as ""Old Mr. Black"" and Lola Pashalinski as Mona Black.

Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close explores loss; coping with the loss of a very dear loved one and even forgiveness.

This movie is heavy, emotional, and filled with angst; young Oskar is very intelligent and driven to resolve the challenge he believes has been left for him by the death of his dad on 9/11.

The movie begins with Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks) having died in the September 11 World Trade Center tragedy. At the funeral, his son Oskar (Thomas Horn) recalls how his father told him about the five boroughs of New York City, but there was a sixth borough right next to Manhattan. No one knows where it is because it floated away. Oskar wants to find the Sixth Borough and his father gives him a map to search for clues. Central Park is not in the same place it used to be. It was in the center of the Sixth Borough. Enormous hooks were driven deep into the ground and the park was pulled by all the people of New York into Manhattan.
 His father mentions one very important clue that a note came from the Sixth Borough.
  One year later, he decides to look through his father's wardrobe closet. It had not been touched since that fatal day. Oskar looks for stuff and accidentally knocks over a small blue vase. it breaks on the floor. He discovers a small manilla envelope. There is a key inside.
  Oskar begins his journey to find out who the key may belong to and what does it unlock.

 Also in the cast: Sandra Bullock, Zoe Caldwell, Max Von Sydow, John Goodman, Stephen Henderson, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright.

 While this movie does have its flaws, I do appreciate how the father had every intent of finishing this game out with his son and providing the clues along the way. He was actually trying to help his son find the final clue to the Sixth Borough, but because the 9-year old child was being stubborn and frustrated, the boy didn't find the clue in front of his father. That is what the father wanted was to see his son excited and happy to finally find the final clue, but it wasn't going to happen on that day.

5060436,5,B0077ATSU4,"I have just finished watching Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and am still weeping, so touched am I by this amazing little movie with such a huge story to tell. I suppose having lost a Dad almost as wonderful as Oskar had could be why it touched me so deeply, even though we lost them in very different ways.

*****SPOILER ALERT***** for the rest of the review****

This movie is about a little boy named Oskar Schell (played with just the right emotion and finesse by Thomas Horn) who has a father and a mother and lives in Manhattan. Oskar is very intelligent and his father (a splendid performance by Tom Hanks) spends a lot of time helping him overcome his many anxieties and expanding his world. Including the fact that there used to be SIX boroughs, instead of five now, which made up New York City. And therein lies much of the wonder of this story.

His father was a jeweler, but on September 11, 2001, he had a meeting on a very high floor in one of the Twin Towers. Oskar doesn't know any of this, of course, and when the airplanes hit the towers, he was let go from school to go home. Oskar's father tries five times to call him at home to say goodbye, leaving uplifting, loving messages. Unfortunately, Oscar doesn't make it home until the sixth message comes in. When he hears the phone ringing, Oskar freezes and cannot answer. He listens as his father leaves a sixth labored message where, in the background he can hear glass breaking and people screaming. And this is pretty much the center of this movie.

How does a little boy come back from such a moment, losing such a loving father, he could not even pick up the phone and listen to his last message from as he was dying? At first, the movie is a bit disjointed and confusing since we don't learn these things until it is tied up at the end of the movie.

Oskar is a curious little boy and one night he meets a neighbor across the courtyard in his grandmother's apartment (we aren't told where his grandmother has gone). But Oskar is on a mission. One day shortly after his father was killed, Oskar finally decides to go into his closet. Inside, his curiosity gets him in trouble as usual, a blue vase lying on the top shelf comes tumbling down on his head, breaks into many pieces. Inside Oskar finds a key in a small manilla envelope with the word Black written on it. Because of the lessons taught to him by his father, Oskar begins his search for whom the key belongs and what he will find inside the lock box the key will fit. Inside of his grandmother's apartment he meets an old man played with the excellence only Max Von Sydow can. The old man joins Oskar's search. He has gotten all of the phone books for all of the boroughs of NYC, circles all the people named Black, and intends to visit each one every weekend, until he finds the one the key belongs to. I think this section is perhaps the most brilliant section of the movie. We, in the audience, already pretty much know that this man is his missing grandfather, Oskar's father's father. And the relationship formed by the two is magical. Von Sydow plays the old man as mute, so he has to write everything down. On one hand he writes yes, and on the other, no. This way, it's a simple way to answer yes or no questions. I was enthralled, watching the ever amazing Von Sydow, a genius of an actor and perhaps one of the best of his profession we've ever been graced with. His relationship with Oskar is always tenuous, we feel his discomfort many times as he tries to help his grandson through his terrifying grief, through this search for the key's box and what he will find inside that might hold the answers as to why Oskar lost his father so outrageously rudely. One day, Oskar decides to play all the messages for him, but Von Sydow cannot handle hearing his son's voice as it gets ever more fearful and difficult to breathe due to toxic fumes. And he leaves.

Oskar is devastated. But of course, in the end, he manages to find the owner of the key, and learns that the key fits a lock box for someone else who lost someone on that terrible day. But that's not what this story is really about. It is really about a little boy's journey toward healing and, as we learn near the end, his seemingly absent mother, played by the always spectacular Sandra Bullock, who, unbeknownst to Oskar, has mapped out his course and visits each Black before Oskar gets there to let them know he will be coming and why. Here is where we get many of the answers that plagued us because, first of all, why would a mother be missing in action the way she seemed to be, and often, the people visited seemed as if they were waiting for him. As Oskar and his mother make this journey, we learn that both find healing in the process. In the end, Oskar writes a letter to each person he has visited and tells them he found the person the key belonged to and thanked them for their help.

This is not a new story. We have certainly seen versions of it before, maybe not for the 9/11 incident, but for many others who are searching for meaning of losing a lost one. What separates this movie from others, is probably the excellent cast, with excellent directing, and a story, while as old as time, never seems to get old. Learning to forgive oneself for things left undone for a loved lost one can be one of the hardest things we, as imperfect human beings need to learn. That this happened on 9/11 wasn't the center of the story. The story teaches us that each journey toward letting go of our anger and hurt toward our lost loved one, is different. But never the less, needs to happen. In the end, Oskar writes to his grandfather and asks him to come ""home"" (he does), and he overcomes his fear of swinging on a set of swings in a NYC park. During his high swing, he notices something at the bottom of the swing. His father, which we saw at the beginning of the movie trying to get him on these swings, left him the note stuffed into the bottom of the swing. In it he tells Oskar that he has finished his journey - in so doing, he has discovered that the missing sixth borough is simply all the people who have finished THEIR journey thus learning what life is all about - overcoming our fear and moving on to live life with all the joy they possibly can.

I'm afraid I can't add anything to that. It's just about right. And in a little way, with Oskar, I joined him in understanding where the people in the sixth borough went. A truly beautiful little movie with a HUGE role for Thomas Horn. Bravo, young man. And to the rest of the cast and crew of this amazing movie, two thumbs up. It was entertaining, and for anybody who has lost a deeply loved one, it is touching and another little secret in how to let go, but never forget. It is not preachy and I never felt a moment's discomfort for my own loss. I did, however, feel the joy of Oskar's discovery at the end. As the survivor of losing such a loved one, this can be a tricky task for a movie. It might be difficult for some people to watch, especially the recordings on the answering machines, but I would encourage any of you who have not seen it, whether you have lost a loved one or not, SEE THIS MOVIE. Some (most) movies make you wish you could get those two hours invested in that loser back. This one is like Goldie Locks says, just right! THIS is why I watch movies. As I have said before (and will again here on Amazon), you have to kiss a lot of frogs to find the prince (or princess). This one is worth kissing!",1349654400,3,7501,4.3036093418259025
5060437,4,B0077ATSU4,"I've wanted to watch this movie since the first time I saw it advertised. I love Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks, so I thought it had to be good. Sadly, they were barely in the movie, but I did love the segments that they were in.

The character of Oskar was hard to like. He was rude, mean to his mom and had a potty mouth. But I did like that he would do anything possible to find out what the key was for, because he thought it was a message to him from his father. Plus, the actor who played Oskar, Thomas Horn, did a great job of portraying him.

I loved that the mom went to such extremes to make her son's journey as smooth as possible. I loved the relationship between Oskar and his dad! And I loved how Oskar and his grandfather related to each other.

One of the main things I didn't get was why this young boy was allowed to traipse all over New York at all hours of the day and night by himself. I just can't see that happening. Plus, during all his wanderings, the streets were mostly people-less. It's NY, and NY isn't not people-less, no matter the hour.

Then there's the fact that the man who is supposedly Oskar's grandmothers friend from her home country is really her (ex?) husband. Even when Oskar figures out who he really is, nobody comments on it. Not the grandmother, not Oskar, not the grandfather, not Oskar's mother. I can't imagine this happening in real life and nobody talking about it!

Final Thoughts:
Even though there are a few things that just didn't make any sense (to me at least), there are some amazing scenes, and that made the movie well worth watching!

I guess the good outweighs the bad, because I'll more than likely watch this movie again.",1349481600,,1683,4.326984126984127
5060438,5,B0077ATSU4,This movie was amazing. I saw it for the first time on netflix and I bawled my eyes out the entire movie. Its about s boy who loses his father in 9/11 and tries to make sense of a senseless act of violence. It made my heart go out to all of the families who lost someone that day. Also I think this is the one movie I can say I liked even better than the book and the book is really great too. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.,1348790400,,446,3.858695652173913

How was this movie not chosen at The Academy Awards?!?
The acting is exceptional - by every cast member. Every moment is compelling. If you have an emotional vein in your body, you will be swept up in the story. If you're looking for mystery/action/thriller, move on. If you care to be touched, watch.
The film gave me the ability to feel tied in with others closely affected by 9/11 - without having to watch newsreels or reality shows or listen to narratives or political theorists - rather simply identify with how it affected us.
Totally satisfying.

5060441,5,B0077ATSU4,"Just because the ending is anti-climatic doesn't make this a bad movie. You want dramatic endings, then you do need to look elsewhere, but this is like life. I was really surprised it didn't have a higher rating. I think this movie should be shown in school to all children to really get a feeling for what 9/11 was REALLY like. My son said it best when he came home from kindergarten that day. ""MOMMY! Two planes crashed into the buildings and the whole city fell down!""

5060442,4,B0077ATSU4,"This movie is based on the best-selling novel of the same title by Jonathran Safran Foer. Whilst no movie can ever contain all that is in a 300+ page novel, the basic facts, and more importantly, the spirit of the novel, were retained despite many changes Hollywood deemed necessary.  I do believe that viewers who have not read the book might be confused by some aspects of the movie (heavy boots, Oskar's insults, codes between characters) and Hollywood has omitted essentially all of the grandmother/grandfather subplot, as well as the effect of what happened in Dresden, Oskar's letters from famous people, upstairs Mr Black and his index cards, the letters from grandfather to son and grandmother to grandson, the digging up of the grave and Oskar's interaction with his psychiatrist (which would have made an excellent scene). Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock were great as Thomas and Linda Schell, but Thomas Horn was absolutely outstanding in his debut acting role as Oskar Schell. The movie was brilliantly directed by Stephen Daldry. Make sure you have the tissues handy: some of the dialogue has been Hollywoodised so it's a real tear-jerker.",1347235200,2,1149,5.0473684210526315
5060443,1,B0077ATSU4,"This is one really terrible movie.  What may seem like an appealing adventure involving a young boy walking around New York City searching for clues with a key, turns into a horrendous mess that goes absolutely nowhere.

The problem is without a doubt the character of Thomas Horn.  His acting is overblown, exaggerated and incredibly stiff.  It's not the least bit realistic that a young kid would act the way he does, and he's obviously trying WAY too hard to deliver his lines (hence the stiff part).  This means you don't feel any compassion for his character, or care about him or his ""adventure"" in any way, shape or form.  It's reminiscent and perhaps influenced by Haley Joel Osment from the Sixth Sense, which is precisely the reason *that* movie failed so miserably.  The difference is that Haley's overconfident character destroyed the horror in the Sixth Sense, and Thomas' character destroys the sense of adventure here.

To add more to the frustration is that there's nothing but one confusing segment after another.  Why did Thomas visit the African American woman and treat her so politely by insisting on snapping a photo of her beautiful face?  Why was he hiding under his bed a short time later?  I can't even say that the overconfidence of Thomas Horns' character is solely the reason this movie is so horrible.  The storyline being confusing is probably equally to blame.  What a waste of time.  His only spectacular moment comes when he argues with his mother (played by Sandra Bullock).

When the boy explains that his father was killed in the 9/11 incident and delivers a bunch of fast-paced frantically delivered lines, math equations and other clues, this is when I finally said ""Alright, I'm done with this"" and shut it off.  This was about halfway through.  The TV show Touch that recently came out last year was probably influenced by this, but Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is way worse than the show thanks to Thomas Horn trying way too hard to be believable and mature but losing all sense of adventure, compassion and interest in the process.  Proof that you may have what it takes to be a quality actor, but end up terribly boring anyway.  As for Tom Hanks, what's it been, 15 years since his last good movie?  Skip it.",1347062400,6,2257,4.753213367609255
5060444,2,B0077ATSU4,"The main character Oskar Schell is the most unlikeable spoiled kid in the entire world.

The wounded characters in the film are vastly underdeveloped and the film becomes just a casting job for Tom Hanks cadre of friends who are normally brilliant performers but aren't given the proper respect of camera time.

Sadly, it just becomes a continuously disappointing compilation like Synedoche but with even more annoying characters.

This film would be absolutely despised if it didn't revolve around the tragedy of 9/11 which combined with the top notch, but ill used cast, is what lures the majority of viewers into the conclusion of contempt for Oskar Schell.

Thomas Horn, a young actor who played the main role, delivered a stellar performance, with wisdom beyond his years about how to portray this part. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock playing his parents, provided the framework for his story rather than being the main event they both do so well. Between the beginning and ending scenes, the story was a beautiful patchwork of moments, emotions, and people all connected by this one tragic event and a young boy's persistent quest to fulfill his father's last challenge.

If anyone remotely likes this ""movie"" I can only suggest you must be related to the director or so called story line writer. It doesn't get any sort of rating from me apart from it actually being worse than The New World. Maybe being Australian I have missed something or I'm not a certain part of the ""field"". I mean, I dislike Red Dog which is an Aussie movie and supposed to be a smash hit.

It's a bit slow but picks up once we flashback to the last few calls from the father and later on when a mysterious elderly man ends up being his partner in solving the mystery.

Hard role to play by a kid (Thomas Horn) who seemed borderline autistic. I was also very impressed with the elderly man (whose character could ""not"" speak) role played by Max von Sydow who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the Academy Awards. John Goodman has a small role in this picture as Stan the Doorman.

Based on a novel of a similar title by by Jonathan Safran Foer. It was also nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. Strangely, the Golden Globes didn't nominate it for anything.

BEST DIALOGUE (SPOILERS): Oskar Schell: If the sun were to explode, you wouldn't even know about it for 8 minutes because thats how long it takes for light to travel to us. Oskar Schell: For eight minutes the world would still be bright and it would still feel warm. Oskar Schell: It was a year since my dad died and I could feel my eight minutes with him... were running out.  /// Oskar Schell: I had to tell someone. I couldn't keep it a secret anymore. Oskar Schell: Can I tell you my story? The Renter: [the renter shows his hand that says 'yes' on it]  Oskar Schell: My father died at 9-11. After he died I wouldn't go into his room for a year because it was too hard and it made me want to cry. But one day, I put on heavy boots and went in his room anyway. I miss doing taekwondo with him because it always made me laugh. When I went into his closet, where his clothes and stuff were, I reached up to get his old camera. It spun around and dropped about a hundred stairs, and I broke a blue vase! Inside was a key in an envelope with black written on it and I knew that dad left something somewhere for me that the key opened and I had to find. So I take it to Walt, the locksmith. I give it to Stan, the doorman, who tells me keys can open anything. He gave me the phone book for all the five boroughs. I count there are 472 people with the last name black. There are 216 addresses. Some of the blacks live together, obviously. I calculated that if I go to 2 every Saturday plus holidays, minus my hamlet school plays, my minerals, coins, and comic convention, it's going to take me 3 years to go through all of them. But that's what I'm going to do! Go to every single person named black and find out what the key fits and see what dad needed me to find. I made the very best possible plan but using the last four digits of each phone number, I divide the people by zones. I had to tell my mother another lie, because she wouldn't understand how I need to go out and find what the key fits and help me make sense of things that don't even make sense like him being killed in the building by people that didn't even know him at all! And I see some people who don't speak English, who are hiding, one black said that she spoke to God. If she spoke to god how come she didn't tell him not to kill her son or not to let people fly planes into buildings and maybe she spoke to a different god than them! And I met a man who was a woman who a man who was a woman all at the same time and he didn't want to get hurt because he/she was scared that she/he was so different. And I still wonder if she/he ever beat up himself, but what does it matter?  Thomas Schell: What would this place be if everyone had the same haircut?  Oskar Schell: And I see Mr. Black who hasn't heard a sound in 24 years which I can understand because I miss dad's voice that much. Like when he would say, ""are you up yet?"" or...  Thomas Schell: Let's go do something.  Oskar Schell: And I see the twin brothers who paint together and there's a shed that has to be clue, but it's just a shed! Another black drew the same drawing of the same person over and over and over again! Forest black, the doorman, was a school teacher in Russia but now says his brain is dying! Seamus black who has a coin collection, but doesn't have enough money to eat everyday! You see olive black was a gate guard but didn't have the key to it which makes him feel like he's looking at a brick wall. And I feel like I'm looking at a brick wall because I tried the key in 148 different places, but the key didn't fit.

The beauty of the film is exactly in its lifting out the story of an obsessive, difficult child dealing with an unimaginable loss. I found it refreshing that this child WAS annoying. Should his process of dealing with grief be packaged neatly into something palatable? I thank the directors of the film for grating us and for forcing us to realize that grief is handled in so many ways and that there are many quiet miracles and many quirky people and ways that help us heal.
The acting was superb. Max von Sydow and Sandra Bullock and the child were simply amazing and deserving of accolades. And thanks to the Tom Hanks character, we have yet another example of a strong, involved father, parenting a difficult kid, everyday he could. As for the New Yorkers portrayed, well, it's why we love that city and are so sorry to not be there very often. A fun addition to the film. It got four stars, not five only because it needed a sharper editor's had a couple of times.  4.5!

5060470,1,B0077ATSU4,"Being an American, I know I'm supposed to love this movie. I hate it. Capitalizing on a tragedy only works if the interpretation is good and this is just plain horrible. The fact that I have to explain why this film is bad is annoying in and of itself.

I watched this movie with my room mate and at first I admired the cinematography and Tom Hanks was good as usual (not in the movie long enough though), and then I realized, ""Wow. This Oskar kid is an annoying douche."" Halfway through I look over at my friend and he's weeping. Sigh. Of course. Make a movie with something to do with 9/11 and Americans start balling. No matter how crappy it is. The creators of this movie knew what they were doing. It's called manipulation.

Anyway, the kid who plays the main character is not a good actor. I know he's supposed to have Asperger's and is a genius or whatever but he sucks. Plain and simple. As another reviewer pointed out, nowhere in the book does it say he's effeminate. And yet he's prancing around whining like a little bitch throughout the entire movie. Not that I have anything wrong with effeminate people but in this case it adds to the annoyance. He ruined the film for me but even if it wasn't for him the script itself is terrible.

5060473,4,B0077ATSU4,"Although hinging on the events of 9-11, this is not a movie about 9-11.  In fact it is the story of one boy, who must come to terms in his own unique way with the loss of his father.  The boy is a sensitive soul, and looks at the world with a unique set of eyes.. possibly he has Aspergers, but it is never made clear.  His relationship with his father (Tom Hanks, who has minimal screen time, but whose presence is nonetheless felt through much of the movie) was strong, with Hanks spending plenty of time with him, setting adventures for his son that would encourage him to interact with the outside world.  When 9-11 takes his dad's life, he sets off on a final quest, to find the lock that fits a key he has found in his dads things.
First of all, it has to be said that Thomas Horn, playing the boy, carries the movie - he gives a quite extraordinary performance, which compels you to believe his world.  Without this performance the movie would be very slight indeed, relying somewhat on contrivance as it does.  Of course there are memorable supporting roles too.. notably Max von Sydow playing an elderly mute who shares an emotional bond with the boy.  These characters along the boys journey, combined with his performance, really make the journey worthwhile, as we see the boy learning that his loss is not the only loss in the world, that through the microcosm of the city he meets on his quest for the key, he understands more about what his father wanted for him, and makes emotional steps as well as figurative ones.
There are times in the movie that the sense of grief is laid on just a little too thick, mostly in the scenes with Bullock as the boys mum and Hanks widow, to the point where I wondered if I really wanted to spend two hours in their company.  However as the movie ties up the loose ends (perhaps a little too neatly?) at the end, the final result is rewarding and poignant in a positive way.  It's almost a shame that the story does not leave a little more unanswered, as the result is moving, yes, at the time - but leaves little to ponder or to resonate in the days after you watch it, robbing this of classic status.  Having said that, however much I was aware how the movie was manipulating me, it actually did successfully push my buttons.  No movie can really encompass some magical coming to terms with something on the scale of 9-11, but viewed as a personal and introspective story, this actually works quite well.",1341792000,,2455,4.40929203539823

When the movie was over we felt like we'd watched it in a dark theater with surround sound.  We don't have any fancy equipment.  The movie just drew you in so completely that you lost track of where you were.

The reviews are oddly fragmented and I think there are a couple of reasons for that:  1) it deals with a very heavy subject, the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and 2) people were expecting to see a movie starring Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks.  Instead, the movie starred an incredible new youngster who was able to carry an entire feature length film.  His performance was beyond belief.  Amazing!  The big names only had supporting roles to young Thomas Horn, and Bullock and Hanks performed those roles with their normal excellence.

Oscar has to process his intense anger and sadness in his own unique way and that is what the movie is all about...

Be warned though, it's a very, very emotional and ""heavy"" movie (especially if you have a family member or friend who deals with similar mental health/development challenges). Probably not a movie that would be good or entertaining for anyone under 13 or `14.

5060486,5,B0077ATSU4,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close captures and distills so many truths into such a poignant and honest story that it will likely leave you enthralled, contemplating its message and characters for days.

The story opens up with a father-of-the-year type dad played by Hanks who tries his hardest to be available to his son, who obviously has some sort of sensing and/or anxiety disorder. The boy is afraid of all kinds of things, but nothing so much as people.

Upon his father's passing, the boy ignores his mother and pursues a fantasy-esque grand quest to find the lock which his father's mysterious key will open. His purpose is simple:  he wants to continue to hold onto his father's memory. Not just a remembrance, but a true memory, like he is there. The boy must face every fear he has to even begin his mission, but for his father, he'll do anything.

The boy's journey is where the movie shines. His hardships, his ability to overcome himself, his enduring love for his father and his interactions with the dozens of hurting people throughout New York City are captivating and heart-chord strumming.

If you enjoy emotional stories that deal this love, death and growth, then you will surely like this film as well. It is something truly unique and special in the milieu of over-done film plaguing the industry.

5060492,2,B0077ATSU4,"I'll start by saying this; I am a huge fan of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel.  In fact, it is probably up there with `The Road', `Lord of the Flies', `American Psycho' and `The Remains of the Day' as one of my five favorite novels ever written (that I've read, obviously).  When this film was green lit and Hollywood was buzzing over it, I was ecstatic.  While I can't say that I worship Daldry, I do think that `Billy Elliot' is a masterpiece and I really, truly loved `The Reader'.  `The Hours', in my eyes, was a bore and a mess and a missed opportunity, but I see some of its merit.  I was underwhelmed by the casting decisions, mainly because Bullock and Hanks aren't my ideal actors (far too commercial for a film like this) and Horn was a complete nobody (I mean, he's from Jeopardy Jr. for god's sake) but the supporting cast which included Sydow, Davis, Goodman, Caldwell, Wright and Gandolfini (I can't believe they cut all of his scenes!) had me excited, and this prose is just so good.

Some books are just not meant to be adapted.

This makes me want to cry, but it's true.  I had this epiphany while watching `Everything is Illuminated', also adapted from a Safran Foer novel, and it happened again while watching `Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close'.  Safran Foer's writing is too absurd and intricate to be captured on the big screen.  A lot of his character development, while interesting and engaging on the printed page, comes off as painfully unrealistic on the big screen.  I told my wife, about halfway through the film, that Oskar is almost identical to the way he is depicted in the novel and yet I never had the urge to push him off a bridge while I was reading the book.

Daldry's take on Foer's novel just doesn't work.  Foer's novel is too complicated and too detailed, and Daldry misses a lot of that detail.  I understand that the prose had to be focused more, considering that they couldn't make a five hour movie just to fit in everything Foer put in his book, but then again if you aren't going to incorporate all the facets of the book that make it so special, maybe you just shouldn't make the movie.  By skipping some of the books important character development (that whole backstory with Oskar's grandmother and the renter is especially important to the impact of the story) the film falls flat in areas where it should have really soared.

I'll break up the negative by saying that Max Von Sydow was extraordinary and deserved that Oscar nomination; maybe even the Oscar just for that `STOP.  NO MORE!' scene alone.

But alas, back to the pit of despair.  I was especially upset with the film's editing choices.  The construction of a novel and a film differ, and a novel can get away with excessive use of flashbacks because they can be clearly defined and incorporated in ways that don't take away from the particular sequence being depicted at that moment.  In film, flashbacks can be tricky, and if they aren't defined properly they can take away drastically from the film itself.  There are a LOT of flashbacks here, and while backstory is necessary to the development of this particular story, the way that they are administered (especially with the incorporated of that horrid narration) kept me getting increasingly more and more frustrated.  They took you out of the moment and put you somewhere else only to take you out of that moment and cause you to scramble to put yourself back where you were before the flashback started.  That narration didn't help much either.  I don't really like narration, unless it is essential.  `Little Children' probably has the best use of narration I've seen in a long time, but it is a rarity to find a film that uses it appropriately.  The fact that Oscar feels the need to tell us EVERYTHING is not appropriate.  The audience isn't stupid, but the narration makes us feel that way.  Then again, Thomas Horn's delivery is atrocious and adds to the annoyance of the narration.

I hate picking on the kid, but it is easily the worst child performance I've seen since that last Sandra Bullock movie.  It's just so painful to watch because he tries so hard to be awkward that he comes off, well, awkward, but not in a good way.  The character of Oskar Schell is an odd one, sure, and so maybe it's just that he doesn't translate well, but I found Horn's manner of speaking to be so incredibly obnoxious I wanted to punch my television screen.  In the book, Oskar thought about weird things and he was unusually smart and curious and he had this maturity that was laced with so much immaturity that he was a compelling character, but I didn't read effeminate, and that is how Horn plays him, which is just odd and off-putting.  Also, the way he talks as if he's reading a book, so rehearsed, is just strange.

I'll end this with some positive ink.  The score is AMAZING and the film is gorgeously lensed.  Sadly, technical aspects don't make for a great movie, and this film fails at nearly everything else.",1339632000,2,4986,4.586907449209932

In the movie I expected emotional manipulation and political polemics, since those are so common in modern movies, but instead I found an honest, realistic, sad and hopeful journey into the heart of a family and into a great city. The acting was superb and the cinematography outstanding. There are areas where the story idealizes some things, but the overall effect was a moving and fitting tribute to life after tremendous loss.

The novel provided much more detail about the characters, their background, and their reasons for living as they do, but the movie could not possibly capture all of that. You get enough information to understand and empathize, without bogging down in exposition. There are slow moments, but this is not a slow movie. Thomas Horne is magnificent as Oscar, the nine year old protagonist, and Max von Sydow is particularly effective as the silent old man who forms a bond with Oscar.

5060504,1,B0077ATSU4,"This is one of those movies that sounded good, even from the preview trailer, but was way too long for me and my family.  I rented it thinking that Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are two talented actors who would be fun to watch.  They do a few emotional scenes very well, but the movie itself is a design mistake.

Perhaps you could you sum up the message of some post-modern works as ""there is no truth, meaning or purpose to life so just deal with it.  The only thing we have in this meaningless universe are the relationships we have with each other.""  The boy's key was not important even though the boy wanted it to be something significant.  The search for knowledge makes you a better person, even if you know there is no hope of finding anything.  The father wanted his son to search for the sixth borough of New York even though he knew it never existed.  The boy would pick up some interesting trivia and talk to people along the way.  The old man knew that the search for the key's purpose was hopeless but went along for the ride anyway.  The encouraging message his father circled in a newspaper was a meaningless mistake from ink bleeding through the paper.  There is no reason to explain why terrorists would want to blow up a tower.  Nobody has answers to explain the world because there aren't any.  Anyone who claims to know is deceived or lying to you.  ""We know that there is no way to know anything with certainty.""

This is a hopeless and dark way to live.  It also makes a painful 2 hours and 10 minutes to watch.  I might have given it two stars had the movie been shorter.  Please give me my money back for movie malpractice.

If you liked the Tree of Life, you might light this one.  I only could tolerate the Tree of Life for 30 minutes.",1338336000,4,1763,4.300911854103344

5060509,2,B0077ATSU4,"Skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and equally well-edited by Claire Simpson, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" is about as good as it can be considering you spend two hours with two of the more annoying characters in recent memory. The first is 11-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) whose father died in 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. The second is Oskar's mute companion (Max Von Sydow), who answers questions by writing on paper, or flashing a ""yes"" or ""no"" tattooed on his palms. Together, they make a twee duo on a Journey for Truth. A Journey that's not really triggered by Oskar's dad but seems to be because the source novel, by Jonathan Safran Foer, needs some reason for the verbally-advanced-but-possibly-autistic Oskar to think he must walk the streets of New York City in search of a person named ""Black."" If the summary seems ridiculous, that's because the story is. Damn if it doesn't go down easier than it should, though. The book is unbearable. The movie isn't.

Thomas Schell (Hanks) bonds best with persnickety  Oskar when he sends him on fictional quests in the city. Maps. Treasures. Clues. So, a year after Hanks' character dies, Oskar finds a key in a vase. And a name: ""Black."" Oskar fancies it as his father's last mission for him, and each Saturday he walks New York City rattling a tambourine for company, because his personality leaves him too scared for public transportation. Soon, a ""renter"" from his grandmother's apartment (Von Sydow) joins Oskar. He's tall and sad, with a secret out there in plain view. Folks tend to receive Oskar and this mute better than you might think for New Yorkers, and there's a reason for that, although it strains credulity just like the rest of the story.

The Foer novel - and screenplay by Eric Roth - piles on props, symbols and emotional subplots. How does Oskar's mom (Sandra Bullock) manage her son's weekly disappearances?  Can Oskar come to terms with his final one-sided conversation with his dad over an answering machine? Does that key open any lock? Will the ""renter"" face up to his failures? While Roth wisely cuts out a lot of Foer's horsecrap - grandma's memory of French-kissing her sister has been redacted, thank God - if you scrutinize the details too closely, you'll find several don't hold up, especially Oskar's fixation with one of the leaping bodies from the World Trade Center.

Oskar, the character, doesn't hold up. His level of organization - not to mention his acute antenna for adult emotions - are far too developed for a kid his age and supposed social struggles. He lapses into bizarre patterns of speech, talking without contractions, as if reciting a collegiate term paper. In one scene, he makes a calculated choice regarding the answering machine that's cruel beyond his comprehension; in another, he's making scrap book beyond his years as recompense for the initial cruelty he never acknowledges. Horn's voice quavers, breaks, bleats. He keeps his eyes wide in every scene. He's a smart, serious kid - he won's Jeopardy's Kids Week competition, which indirectly led to this role -  and that works against him here.

Von Sydow, an Academy Award nominee for this performance, does a lot with pauses, shuffles and facial expressions to make up for the lack of dialogue. It's excellent acting for a shaggy dog of a character. Hanks has a small role depicting what amounts to a saint. Bullock's out of her depth, but that's no sea change. Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are a weary, estranged couple, careful in their performances.

Daldry (""The Hours"" and ""The Reader"") took plenty of shots from critics for his ""exploitative"" direction; that's code, at least in this case, for effective work. Whereas the book dawdles and tumbles into nonsense, the movie clips along. Daldry's big on fast-moving montages and matching images from scene to scene, and if you're trying to convey connectivity, there are worse proclivities to have. I disagree with his choice of title sequence and the movie's final image - which is a stark juxtaposition - but that's what the book gives him. It's bad there. It's bad here. In between is a polished, effective piece of emotional snookery, anchored by a lead character you'll love or hate. It doesn't work on me - Oskar's a bridge too far, and the novel is odious - but it will work on some.",1338076800,9,4331,4.867028493894166
5060510,4,B0077ATSU4,"The film itself is not really a master piece nor is it boring. But it does seem to bring out that in the viewer. So there must be some underlying truth that it brings out for those with the propensity to see.

The story is simple but the telling is complex and many of the people are intricate. I need to break here to say that I thought that Max von Sydow as ""The Renter"" added a great deal to the ambiance of the mystery. The story is of young Oskar Schell whom loses his father to the 9.11 events. His father always set Oskar off on missions to find things about life and history. So when Oskar finds a hidden key he assumes that it will tell him something about his father. So he embanks on a mission to find the lock that fits the key. His only clue is the word black written on the key's envelope. Following this clue Oscar begins to explore and grow. We explore and grow with him.

Since it was altered, there were some inaccurcies within the movie that were a little off if you read the book. The actor who played the kid did a great job. I personally would've like to have seen more background about the other people Oskar meets during his expedition, however, I realize that the movie was already pretty long and not much else would have fit into it.

I think there was a good balance between present day and flashbacks. The movie also was able to capture the craziness and randomness that Safron Foer presents in his book.

5060526,4,B0077ATSU4,"Somehow I just couldn't really get into this movie.  I gave it four stars because the acting was superb and it had an unusual plot.  The young boy did an incredible job (and I think this was his first major role) and of course Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock did their usual fabulous acting.  It had a very intriguing plot:  A man goes to a meeting in the World Trade Center (in one of the towers) on 9-11 and is killed.  His son finds a key in his dad's belongings, assumes that it is another of the games he and his dad used to play and starts hunting for who the key belongs to.  But it had some obstacles to overcome.  The main character (the boy) was, in his own words, odd.  In fact, he was very strange and I could easily imagine how hard it was for his mom, confronted with this brilliant little oddity, to figure out how to deal with him.  Actually, the movie worked that out fairly well and it also eventually worked out something that bothered me through a large part of the movie; the fact that this kid ran all over New York, day and night, by himself.  I grew up in a town with about 200 people (living in the town itself; the rural area around it had 3 or 4 times that) and my mother wouldn't let me play in the front yard by myself, even in the daytime.  His mother seemed a little uncaring.  However, as I said, that was explained a little (though not very well, in my opinion) at the end of the movie.  There's some profanity, too, although it's kind of disguised, but not so well that you don't know what he's saying.  And one last thing, I never have figured out where the name came from.  If it was explained in the movie, I missed it.  I suppose it doesn't really matter, but it bothered me.  Bottom line:  it's worth one watch (as anything with Tom Hanks and/or Sandra Bullock probably is) but whether you ever watch it again depends on the type of person you are and what kinds of movies you like.  It was just a hard movie to enjoy, unless you like somewhat oddball movies.",1336262400,,1995,4.188976377952756

As I went through it, I started to understand him and his issues. People with no sympathy for a kid with this sickness are just irritated. They aren't looking, or trying to look, under the surface.

The young man's acting abilities weren't up to the standards of his adult counterparts but he played a convincing performance of a quirky young boy dealing with the tragedy of losing his father underscored by his ""maybe"" Asperger's Syndrome.

I think that the negative reviews are harsh but we are all bringing our own experiences to the theatre in this case. I have a son about this boy's age and I could relate to many of the things this mom and her son were going through.

After seeing it was based on a book, I had to read it.  The book was extremely frustrating at times, but incredibly rewarding by the end.

I immediately warmed up to the kid, Oskar Schell, as a character. He's a cute little kid with a sense of humor, big heart, big imagination, one who asks too many questions. But as the central character, telling his story in first person, you have to remember how any real kid affected from 9/11 might react to losing a family member that day, how would they process it years later?

Sure, Oskar's story is an adventure - both physical and emotional - as he finds a key that he believes is a clue left by his father and he goes in search of the lock it opens. But the real journey is Oskar seeking answers to questions, and in truth, trying to find out what those questions are.

Oskar's adventure is the movie's focus as it should be.  In the book, he shares half the pages with the story of his grandparents. I found myself skimming through their sections anyway, so I was glad Hollywood did not spend much time there either. The story of Oskar's grandparents does play a crucial part in the film, but it remains a very minor plot line. This being said, I was very curious as to how the movie would end, and though it was completely different from the book I have to say I was well satisfied.

The book has a lot of artistic value to it.  It contains random pictures, scribblings, strange justifications of text, stream of consciousness type stuff. But that's what gives Oskar's character his voice.  Surprisingly, a lot of this comes across in the movie quite perfectly.  And for that, I found the movie to be as equally rewarding.",1334620800,,1830,4.449101796407185
5060551,1,B0077ATSU4,"I thought the whole movie was boring and annoying. Other 9/11 movies like United 93 and Twin Towers are much more inspirational. Now you enjoy watching an aggravated depressed child for 90 minutes this is just the movie for you, not for me.",1334620800,7,240,4.604651162790698
5060552,5,B0077ATSU4,"I must admit I was hesitant to rent this movie at first because of the mixed reviews. I ended up renting it anyway, and cannot stop thinking about it, hours after I've watched it. I should caution you that anyone expecting some kind of formulaic Hollywood-type movie or a movie about 9/11 should just stop there. This movie is told in the perspective of a boy some kind of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). (In the movie, he says he was tested for Asperger's, but it was inconclusive or something like that). Although it is beautifully and thoughfully made, you honestly have to know someone with an ASD to FULLY appreciate this movie. I can say this because my own son has Asperger-like symptoms. SOO many times while I was watching this movie I was stunned that someone understood my son to a ""T"", down the very fine details like his fear for swings. I had to laugh when I saw the props in Oskar's room; my son has many similar things like that: huge map, space-themed banner, down to the ""Moon-in-my-room"" by Uncle Milton hanging on the wall LOL Someone did their research! ;)
So anyway, enough about ASD.
I just want to let people know that the previews they saw in the theatre for this movie is not an accurate portrayal of what this movie is really all about. Anyone expecting dramatic footage or something heart-wrenching should just go rent a 9/11 documentary or something. This movie does it much more subtly and symbolically. If you watch this movie with an open-mind, and take the whole 9/11 thing out of the whole equation, you'll probably enjoy it more. Think of it more as a journey of growth, by an unexpected protagonist. Anyone that still does not like the movie even reading my warning should just go ""Succotash my Balzac, dip shiitake!"" haha

In some places the director makes the decision to move away from the cold-hearted reality of city life (we see the young boy openly talking to strangers for example). Personally, I don't mind this. The suspension of pure reality helps to create a story line that is better at stirring the emotions.

There aren't enough Schells in the world. That's the way I felt after watching Extremely Loud, Incredibly Close. Society tends to dictate what should be important to us.
Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) and his father, Thomas (Tom Hanks), walk to a different drum beat.
Thomas, who hums ""I Am the Walrus,""'is constantly creating games for his 9-year-old son, Oskar. These are not a-typical games, but adventures where the youngster must visit odd places, talk to complete strangers and read many books to solve riddles.
The games stop on 9/11. Thomas, a jeweler by trade, has a meeting in the World Trade Center when the planes hit. He makes repeated calls home, which Oskar hears later via the answering machine. Their is no body in the casket for the funeral so Oskar has no closure.
He can't help but think this is another elaborate puzzle his father has left behind to solve.
It begins when he finds a key inside a small manila envelope inside of a blue vase. The envelope has the word ""Black"" on it. Oskar sets out on an adventure to locate every person, with the last name Black in New York City. Along the way, Oskar meets an elderly gentleman, Max von Sydow, who rents an apartment from his grandmother. The renter can't speak but instead writes notes to Oskar. The odd couple become closer as they search for clues.
Oskar resents his mother, Linda Schell (Sandra Bullock), because she wasn't there when his dad called home on that fateful day so he keeps his activities a secret from her.
In the end, Oskar doesn't find what he thinks he's looking for but much, much more.",1334102400,,1632,4.666666666666667

The father came alive to relive life within the family again.  Then, he died again in the 911 attacks on the World Trade Center.  The boy was superb in holding the film together with his narrative while the mother played by Sandra Bullock held a passive position...As a matter of fact - I can't remember seeing a role where Sandra was this passive.  I don't want to give away the film in case anyone wishes to see it - but the film wasn't worth the $12.00 movie price. And it certainly not worth the $3.00 rental price.

This is a story about a smart boy, Oskar, who maybe has Asperger's. He and his dad were very close and the dad would create things to investigate - it was their thing.

A year after his dad died in the 9-11 twin tower attack, Oskar finds a key hidden in a vase in his dads closet, which he THINKS is a CLUE for him from his dad and it becomes extremely important and urgent for him to solve (as a way of being close to his dad and making his dad proud, and just plain dealing with the loss of his dad and all the emotions of the secrets he kept from that day).

Oskar is often annoying, high strung and rude, but with the Asperger's and what he's been through emotionally it is understandable - and Thomas Horn does a great job with this role.

5060576,5,B0077ATSU4,"Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) shares an incredibly close relationship with his father, Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks). Oskar is an extraordinary child who has some very particular social quirks. His list is rather extensive and it's revealed that he was once tested for Asperger's Syndrome. However, Thomas Schell spends a great amount of time with his son and does everything he can to help him overcome his fears. However, on September 11, 2001 as the world changes forever, tragically so does the life of Oskar and his mother, Linda (Sandra Bullock), as Thomas was in the second tower of the World Trade Center when it fell. Linda attempts to move on with life, but Oskar refuses to move forward. A year later, he accidently destroys a blue vase while rummaging through his father's closet and discovers a key in an envelope simply marked ""Black"". Thomas constantly played games with Oskar and led him on journeys around the city, hiding clues and prizes in the most unexpected places. Oskar is convinced the key is a gift left behind by his father to send him on one last adventure. Determined to find the door the key unlocks, Oskar begins a systematic search of the city, trying to locate the person with the last name ""Black"" who will be able to help him solve the mystery. Along the way, Oskar becomes acquainted with a man his grandmother has been renting a room to. The man seems to have no name and is simply known as ""The Renter"" (Max Von Sydow). The Renter is a survivor of WWII and reminds Oskar of his father. The two become unlikely companions and friends as they search the city to unravel the mystery of the key.

EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is based upon a 2005 novel by Jonathan Foer. I've not read the novel, so I can't compare the movie to the book.

The movie is an extremely moving piece of cinema. It goes to places that the audience might not suspect. The movie has a satisfying ending, but it's not necessarily a happy one. Like life, Oskar's journey doesn't turn out exactly as he had hoped. However, like all journeys, it changes his life forever.

The acting in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is amazing. Tom Hanks plays a small, but important role. Newcomer Thomas Horn is so powerful that it's difficult to believe this is the first time he's ever acted on film before. Sandra Bullock has a strong supporting role that is worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Max Von Sydow speaks no lines, but his eyes speak more and convey more emotion than the most well trained politician. John Goodman has what is basically a cameo as Stan the Doorman, but it's always a joy to watch Goodman perform, even in a role such as this. There are numerous smaller roles in the various Blacks that Oskar meets. Most of these characters are only on screen for a few brief moments but each of them ground their scenes in realism. EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a good movie that is made great by the acting performances. If for no other reason, it's worth watching for the acting alone.

EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a very emotional movie. For Americans, particularly those who lived and worked in New York on September 11, 2001, it will probably have a different kind of reaction. However, though the story is told through the lens of September 11th, the film is really a story about a young man coming to grips with the unexpected death of his father. It's a film that will probably resonate with anyone who has lost a parent they were close to. I cried several times and the film really made me think about my own Dad and his untimely death. I left the theatre thinking about many of the memories I have of my Dad. It made me a little sad, but very grateful. In the future, I'm sure that EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a movie I'll watch whenever I'm sad and thinking about my Dad because I know that though it might cause a few tears, it'll cheer me up in the end and, like Thomas Schell and my own father, encourage me to not stop looking for whatever adventure life holds.",1333324800,6,4031,4.555862068965517

5060578,2,B0077ATSU4,"In ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"" 9-year-old Oskar (Thomas Horn) faces life without his father, Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks), who died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, a time Oskar refers to as ""The Worst Day.""  Oskar happens upon an envelope among his father's possessions.  The envelope is labeled ""Black"" and inside is a key.  Oskar enjoyed the treasure hunt and riddle games his dad was always inventing for them, and figures this key might be one last game his dad left for him.  Surmising that Black is someone's name, Oskar determines to visit everyone in New York City with that name to find out what the key opens.

A socially awkward kid who was tested for Asperger's syndrome, Oskar devises a methodical plan to visit each and every Black on his list, borough by borough, neighborhood by neighborhood.  Because he has psychological issues with the subway and buses, he sets out on foot to pursue his quest on foot during the weekends, carrying a tambourine to calm his nerves, as his mother (Sandra Bullock), caught up in her own grief, passively watches. Oskar is assisted in his journey by an elderly man (Max von Sydow), a mute who rents a room in his grandmother's (Zoe Caldwell) apartment.

Tom Hanks appears briefly at the beginning of the film and intermittently later on in flashback to illustrate the strong bond between father and son.  The elder Schell was fond of creating mind problems and engaging Oskar to figure them out.  They would involve putting clues together and allowing Oskar to unravel them with minimal assistance.  With his father gone, a huge void is left in Oskar's life and he creates a kind of secret shrine to his dad, which includes the answering machine containing the last words spoken by his father on The Worst Day -- recordings even his mother hasn't heard.

Young Mr. Horn is clearly the focus of the movie.  His Oskar is bright, determined, unconcerned with his own limitations, and consumed with his quest.  Because his Oskar is somewhat off -- not the typical kid you'll find next door -- it's tough to identify with him.  We feel for his loss on a non-emotional level because it's what anyone would feel about a kid who's lost his dad.  This is not to disparage Mr. Horn, who delivers what is asked of him.  But because his Oskar skews from the norm, he has some resistance to overcome to get the audience engaged.

Mr. Horn is not terrific at eliciting instant empathy.  Because he doesn't approach his grief in traditional fashion -- crying, moodiness, withdrawal -- he is an oddity.  This creates an emotional distance between character and viewer.  We are interested up to a point, but then start wondering.  Shouldn't this kid be in therapy?  Is it safe for a young boy to be traveling the boroughs alone?  Isn't it the responsibility of an adult in his life to explain the folly of his goal and keep him safe?

Director Stephen Daldry and writer Eric Roth have put together an excessively sentimental tale about loss, healing, and acceptance with little attempt at subtlety or restraint.  Under Daldry's direction, Mr. Horn must carry the picture, and though he gives it a Herculean try, he can't salvage a flawed script.

There are several additional problems.  First, many of the characters remain sketchy.  Oskar's mom, his grandmother, a certain Mr. and Mrs. Black (Jeffrey Wright, Viola Davis) and especially the elderly renter are curiously underdeveloped.  Because the relationship Oskar forms with the elderly man is the boy's first real bond with another human being since the death of his father, it approaches poignancy, but Daldry simply uses the character as an interesting footnote rather than as someone who has a lasting effect on the youngster and his search for the impossible.

Jonathan Safran Foer, the author of the novel on which the film is based, incorporated information about the effect of the Allied bombings of the German city of Dresden on the Schell family and contained ruminations on terrorism, war, and personal lives thrown into chaos by politics.  These are absent from the movie, leaving it more about communal healing than about national trauma but not making us feel an emotional investment in its characters.

Sentiment is fine in a Lassie movie or in measured doses in mainstream films.  What feels wrong in ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is its obvious manipulation.  Director Daldry uses a child in an emotional tailspin in a blatant attempt to win our hearts but keeps us at arm's length, never quite succeeding in embracing us.  We start as spectators and remain so.

The film has a rambling nature until the elderly renter joins Oskar in his trek around the city.  There is great chemistry between the two, and von Sydow's exceptional performance elevates the movie considerably.

Rated PG-13, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" plays as a mystery predicated upon a young boy's desperation to solve his father's unintended final riddle.  As a picture about grief, it shows that the loss of a loved one takes different tolls on different people and each bereaved person must get over it in his own way.  Actual images of the 9/11 tragedy are fleeting, fortunately, and serve mostly to express the horror of the day. Ultimately, the movie never fully involves the viewer.  The fine performances far surpass the caliber of the script.",1333324800,9,5361,4.873068432671082
5060579,5,B0077ATSU4,"To say that this film touched my soul would be an accurate description at least. I would imagine that everyone everywhere has lost at least once in their life profoundly and know that the depth of such a loss is EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE. We all lost someone on that ""the worst day"", that September 11 madness day. We ALL lost fellow American's. And not just at the World Trade Center, which so often in my humble opinion seems to get lost as lost can be when we don't say what happened at the Pentagon and in a field in the middle of nowhere. Just because my Mother died August 5, 1992 with no notice and with a swiftness that takes my breath away even now instead of September 11, 2001 doesn't make it any less EXTREMELY LOUD nor INCREDIBLY CLOSE....it's painful and it hurts and it's angry and it's sad and it's searching and it's finding and it's all the things that we wish we didn't have to go through to make us who we are. This child seemed highly inappropriate the way he treated his mother and everyone in his path, but really? Was he inappropriate? When you experience profound loss, what is appropriate?

Director Stephen Daldry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reader/dp/B001VEE5KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reader</a>) and screenwriter Eric Roth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Curious-Case-of-Benjamin-Button/dp/B002C4YYEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a>) have adapted the contemporary plot from the book eschewing the foundational World War II flashback which provided much of the emotional springboard for the 9/11-triggered events that engulf the young protagonist, Oskar, a precocious and lonely eleven-year-old living on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Foer challenged the reader by making Oskar borderline autistic in order to dissect the psychological devastation induced by 9/11 in its most basic terms with the loss of his father. Daldry and Roth wisely chose a first-time actor, Thomas Horn, to embody Oskar as someone more experienced would have likely come across as too mannered and sympathetic for such a polarizing figure. On the other hand, Horn, a former Jeopardy! champion, embodies the character's sharp intellect, lack of amiability, and monomaniacal sense of purpose with surprising acuity. It's either an impressive debut or an exhausting one-shot performance as he is in almost every scene of the film.

On his own idiosyncratic terms, Daldry attempts to present 9/11 as a malevolent, almost surreal act that turns an otherwise banal and safe world into one of seeping paranoia and immeasurable fear. Still reeling from the World Trade Center death of his gregarious, life-loving father Thomas, Oskar has hidden the phone machine, on which his father left six messages, away from his low-key attorney mother Linda. A year after the tragedy, the troubled boy finds a unique way to deal with his grief when he inadvertently breaks a blue vase in his father's closet as he rifles through his father's effects hoping for some kind of message left behind. Finding an envelope with a key inside the broken vase, Oskar notices the envelope is marked ""Black"", and his imagination reels with what he thinks is the legacy of his father's scavenger hunts. Tethered to nothing in the way of logic, he sets out across the breadth of New York City to meet and question all 472 people named Black in the phone book, so he can find out what the key unlocks. This is where Oskar's quest takes flight as he bounces from one encounter to another looking for a clue.

Joining him for much of his journey is the Renter, a mute tenant that his grandmother shelters in her apartment across the street. His identity holds a certain clue to the mystery surrounding his father but not the one Oskar is looking for. The boy also intersects with a divorcing couple who tie into another thread of the mystery. As it does in the source novel, all of the events and character tics come across as rather contrived to support the 9/11 allegory being presented, even though the film itself is handsomely produced with first-rate camerawork by Chris Menges. The performances by the rest of the cast compensate as well. In small supporting roles despite their star billing, Tom Hanks is ideally cast as Thomas, and Sandra Bullock - in her first role since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blind-Side/dp/B002VECM6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blind Side</a>&nbsp;- brings quiet dignity and strength to Linda.

But the film's emotional burden never really elevates the themes that Daldry wants desperately to convey in a sea of contrivance. Ultimately, this narrative burden makes 9/11 fade into the background more than it should, and one is left with the forlorn feeling that the event has been more exploited than explored.",1333065600,5,4653,6.26875

5060588,4,B0077ATSU4,"Jonathan Safran Foer's popular novel EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE managed to touch many lives with his subtle depiction of the reaction to the horror of the events of 9/11 by assigning the perception to a bright, Asperger's Syndrome-afflicted young boy named Oskar Schell whose father was one of the inexplicable deaths on that `worst day'. Eric Roth has done the near impossible task of translating Safran Foer's language and method of storytelling into a film script that for the most part works on every level. As directed with the inordinate sensitivity of Stephen Daldry the impact of not only the book, but also a restoration of the events of that fateful day in the history of this country, are unveiled in a manner that not only makes a long film seem short but also is able to tie together the various characters and incidents of this story on film that provides on of the most sensitive bouquets of the meaning of the Family of Man.

Oskar Schell is inhabited by Thomas Horn, a youngster making his first film and his lack of expected sophistication of acting only makes this terrified but determined lad more credible.  Tom Hanks is Oskar's beloved jeweler father who leaves voice mails during the collapse of the buildings, messages that Oskar keeps to himself (we find out later why), not even sharing the connect with his grieving mother (Sandra Bullock).  Through a series of discoveries Oskar finds a key in an envelope with the single word `Black' on it and he sets out to find the source of the key and in doing so reconnected with his deceased father. He is joined by the mute Renter (Max von Sydow) who lives next to his Grandma (Zoe Caldwell) and together they comb New York meeting everyone with the name of Black - and in the process we encounter some superb cameos by Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, an uncredited appearance by Eddie Izzard and many more. Oskar's journey finally comes to an end in a most touching way as the truths are revealed.

The surprise of this film is the manner in which as much attention is subtly played with the amalgamation of people that comprise New York: children and adults with mental disorders, Jews, African Americans, immigrants of all sorts, fey cross dressers, angry people, kind people - everyone has a story that is equally important as Oskar's pursuit. This technique magnifies the message of Safran Foer's story - that we are all linked by a common bond. This film is an experience. Share it. Grady Harp, March 12",1332979200,4,2497,4.733333333333333

He gets away with too much or maybe the part is just poorly written:  so obvious that he is saying to his mother what will hurt because he is hurting.  But so is everyone around him.

5060609,4,B0077ATSU4,"A Boy's Quest in EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE
Ambitious in concept, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is the love story of a troubled boy whose bond with his father transcends death and events beyond his understanding.  Director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott, The Hours) has put together an interesting study in post trauma and rediscovery.  It doesn't always work, but it still registers on an emotional level.

A funeral signals the death of a family member and a boy's alienation to the world.  In flashbacks, Oskar (Thomas Horn), who has trouble communicating and may have Asperger Syndrome, adores his father (Tom Hanks) who challenges him with riddles and treasure hunts to meet people outside his apartment.  Both father and mother (Sandra Bullock) are loving parents, and the world becomes an interesting laboratory for exploration and discovery.  Life is idyllic until 9/11 when everything changes and Oskar is witness to his father's last moments trapped in one of the Twin Towers.  A year later, looking in his father's closet, he discovers a key in an envelope with the letters `black'.  Who or what does the key belong to? Oskar sets out to find out by systematically tracking down every `Black' in the phone book and visiting each person for a clue.  This big scavenger hunt is at best a daunting task.

His grandmother who lives across the street has a mysterious renter (Max Von Sydow) who does not speak and can only communicate by jotting on a note pad or displaying `yes' and `no' written on each hand.  The renter takes a liking to Oskar and accompanies him on his quest.  This is a search that proves overwhelming as each person they find has a story too.  When all hope seems lost, the road leads back to that fateful September morning and opens Oskar to the truth about his parents and himself.

At first you wonder if this hunt will be meaningful and be rewarded or if it is a waste of time.  Oskar's obsession keeps him connected to his father; to fail is to lose whatever he has left of that relationship.  In a way, it is about trying to make sense of his father's death and coming to terms with it.  It is also about the forgiveness of guilt that nearly consumes Oskar.

You kind of think that at some point a miracle may occur or that something profound may happen, but what does reveal itself does not quite answer all the questions, and maybe that's just the  point to the film, that life is part mystery and we never truly understand its riddle.

When you take stock of all the people that Oskar encounters, you realize that every one of them can sympathize or has suffered some kind of loss, and how they react to that in relation to Oskar shows how the trauma of loss can be a common bond.  You wish you could learn more about some of these people.

Von Sydow gives a memorable performance without uttering a word as the renter who has a personal, family secret.  Why does he remain mute?  Was he a survivor of something so traumatic like the concentration camps of Europe that he does not speak?  In a supporting role, Viola Davis is effective playing a character who figures prominently at the beginning and the end.

In the end, Oskar has learned something about himself and his family, and through his journeys, he has matured in a new post-9/11 world.  Ultimately, the revelation at the end is bittersweet and that without the power of forgiveness, closure is incomplete.  It also speaks to a part of humanity that we all share.",1330041600,103,3472,4.638297872340425
5060610,4,B0077ATSU4,"I am happy to have watched this film at the theater.  Despite the generally not-so-positive reviews, this film turns out to be surprising well done.  Both this film and Hugo deal with how a son copes with the loss of a father.  Hugo gives us a very lovable boy but this film gives us a troubled boy (which to me is harder to present).  I like this film better because I don't think all kids should be, must be lovable in real life.  I also think, in real life, we (adults and kids) don't usually act on our best behavior when in deep, deep grief (as reflected in this film).  I don't mind seeing that side of reality in a film because it is in the redemption that gives us (the audience) the resolution to a terrible tragedy (the sudden loss of someone we love).  I can understand and identify with both boy's need to continuing on a project their fathers started while alive as a way of holding on to their relationship a bit longer. I like this film better because it goes into the boy's realization that at the end of the project, his father is still dead and there's no secret message to be had.  Some critics were ""offended"" because the film took place with 9/11 as its background.  I don't think the director/writer was taking advantage of a tragedy.  I think it was just a recent tragedy that gives most of us a common starting point.

Is this a film worth buying the DVD or Blu-Ray?  It will depend on what extra features it will have.  A good feature commentary might be good for film buffs and some info on how ""real"" people deal with tragedies or the grief process etc might interest people.

I personally see no fault or problem in films being made about the event, as long as it doesn't in any way come off as exploitative (I'm pointing at YOU, World Trade Center).  Many I know say they usually pass on 9/11 films due to having already lived through it, but have you?  With that in mind, on with the review.

This past Tuesday, the Academy announced their nominations for this year's Oscars.  Among them was Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which was greeted with applause as it was revealed it nabbed a Best Picture nomination.  So today, I've decided to see the film for myself, and I have to honestly say I was left feeling disappointed.

Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks), a loving husband and father, was killed on 9/11 during a meeting at the World Trade Center.  He leaves behind his distraught wife Linda (Bullock) and his always-curious son Oskar (Horn), born with a natural sense for adventure and seeing things through.  Weeks after ""the worst day"" as he calls it, Oskar is shuffling through his deceased father's closet when he knocks over a vase containing a key, which is in a small envelope with ""Black"" written on it.

To make all sorts of explaining really short, he sets off on an expedition in New York City.  His plan is to find every person with the last name ""Black"" in all the five boroughs, hoping to get information about the mystery key.  Along the way he meets many people facing problems of their own, including a sheltered and mute-by-choice old man (Max Von Sydow, in the best performance of this movie) who only goes by the alias `The Renter.'

Along the way, Oskar slowly pries his way into the Renter's mysterious life and equally strains his relationship with his mother, all in the hope of getting another chance at a few more minutes of spiritual face-time with his father.

I'm not gonna lie, I loved the story.  However, screenwriters Eric Roth and Jonathan Foer pulled a few cinematic punches I didn't really like.  Parts of the way the story was told seem to deceive us, almost to the point of leaving an inconsistent pace.  This left me as an audience member feeling disjointed and asking myself if parts of the film were indeed the exploitation I was speaking of earlier.

I was left feeling like if this film's background was based on anything BESIDES 9/11, this film would be absolutely forgettable and the Academy would pay no heed.  I'm not saying I feel like the film ONLY got Oscar attention because of that legitimate ""worst day,"" I'm just saying that let's say Tom Hanks was killed in a car wreck or something, then the eventual moral of this film would be completely ruined before the quarter-mark.  The way 9/11 was used as a deliberate dramatic device instead of a legitimate piece of the plot is extortion.",1328745600,5,2869,4.621301775147929
5060612,5,B0077ATSU4,"Most of us in this country, indeed most of those in the civilized world, has a memory of where they were and how they felt on September 11, 2001.  Many, of course, have painful and permanent losses to deal with.  For myself, we were far from home on that day, and I truly felt that something of our world had ended.  Which, in fact it had.  So when it was announced that there would be a movie, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which would touch on those tragic events, our first response was, ""No, we don't think so.""  Then we learned who was to be in this movie, and the cast included so many of our favorite actors:  Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, Max von Sydow, John Goodman, people we felt we could trust to do such a subject justice, and we said, ""Well....""  Then we learned more about the story of the film (and story is everything, to us) and we asked ourselves, ""How could we not see it?""

And I'm so very glad we did.  Everyone is predictably excellent.  The story is beautifully done, and at the same time simple and deeply layered.  The child actor makes you believe he is dealing with the personal problems of the child character.  These problems would be unique and difficult enough, if they did not also include the loss of an incredible father under horrific circumstances, and you share the pain of this family of grandmother, mother and son, while the story is told from so many different directions.  Being one of those who cry at Hallmark commercials, I am always loathe to see any movie or play or read any book that wants to make me cry.  But this movie is not like that.  I did just fine throughout the entire story, experiencing it intensely but dry-eyed.  Until the end.  Until I got to the point where I could fully appreciate the efforts this family made to move forward, the grace with which they and the families they represented dealt with what they were given.  Until I could see the wonder of the story.

It was terrible in the parts that invoked the events that we already knew had happened; it became wonderful beyond my power of description because of a boy on a swing.  And then I wept.",1328227200,46,2151,4.438775510204081
5060613,2,B0077ATSU4,"This movie is the kind of movie that all viewers should see while sitting in a hard-backed chair.  Not because of the subject matter, which deserves better treatment than this, but because the movie is so agonizingly slow with such an agonizingly shrill performance by the kid actor Thomas Horn, that your body might demand that you shut down your conscience thinking and seek refuge in sleep.  The hard-backed chair will make that difficult, and you will find yourself being bombarded by a one-tone performance by the lead actor.  This is a beautiful movie to watch with a terrific message, but the message simply is lost due to the bad acting.

Tom Hanks is great.  So is Sandra Bullock.  However, their combined screen time works out to less than 12 minutes.  The theater I saw this in was 2/3 full, and I didn't hear much sniffling.  By the time the emotional payout finally arrived, it seemed as though most of the patrons were long since ready to leave the theater.",1327708800,5,971,4.670588235294118
5060614,3,B0077ATSU4,"I almost didn't see this movie.  It was getting such bad press by most critics, but then Oscar seems to think there is something there.  Now I certainly don't agree with the Academy much of the time but still, they often get it right.  Oskar (a very good Thomas Horn) is a boy of about 12 who lost his father (Tom Hanks in flashbacks) in one of the towers on 9/11.  They were very close.  More so than with mom (Sandra Bullock).  Oskar is a strange young man, borderline autistic.  He admits that he was tested but the results were ""inconclusive.""  For sure he is odd.  One of those kids that gets picked on in school for wearing black socks and oxfords instead of Nikes.

Oskar discovers a key inside a vase he accidently broke and believes that his dad wanted him to find the lock that matches.  The key is inside a small envelope with the word Black written on it.  This is a clue Oskar's father left for him he convinces himself, so he set out to find out where the key fits.  This is the first thing that is a bit puzzling.  The key is clearly one that fits a safety deposit box, but all the adults don't seem to see that.  So he tries it on numerous doors, padlocks and other locks in his search to find the right Mr. or Ms. Black.  Early on he traipses all across the boroughs of New York City, on foot!  Then he is escorted by an old man who is known as ""The Renter"" because he lives in a room let by Oskar's grandmother across the street.  The old man (Oscar nominee Max von Sydow) can't or won't speak.  But he writes clearly in bold letters on a note pad he carries.  Ultimately Oskar discovers where the key belongs, so what we have is the improbably journey.  Along the way, flashbacks of 9/11 and the associated guilt Oskar feels surfaces.

The film is clearly sentimental and to some degree manipulates our emotions.  I don't find this terribly obtrusive, but Oskar's emotions are sometimes a bit much.  Still, reading some of the professional reviewers I find opinions all over the place.  Some even say they were offended.  Huh?  Is this Oscar-worthy in terms of Best Picture?  No.  Is this a sallow, bland, irritating, self-important film? No.  This is one of the most overly underrated films of the year and one of the most overly overrated at the same time.",1327708800,14,2277,4.365155131264917
5060615,1,B0077ATSU4,"Three of us went to see this movie and none of us cared for it.  We wish we would have gone to Joyful Music instead.  The theatre was pretty much empty, about ten people there.  We heard no positive comments on the way out.  If you are into watching and rewatching the horrors of 911 and people not knowing what to do with their pain then maybe this movie is for you.  I regret I went and would not have if I had done a background check into what it was about.  All I can say is for me it was a complete waste of time, money, and a complete disappointment for what was to be an enjoyable gathering with friends.",1327708800,11,611,4.008264462809917

8511595,2,B0077ATSU4,"I can (and often do) enjoy the film of a novel as long as the film thoughtfully interprets the book. In this case, the book is dumbed-down version of the novel - rewritten to make the characters' complexities far more obvious. It spends far too much time dwelling on the tragedy of 9/11, instead of focusing on the journey the characters take to heal and move on.

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that all the actors are wonderful - especially Von Sydow. The fault is in the script and the direction  both of which lack any of the subtlety and joy of the book. The biggest flaw is that Oskar is a truly sympathetic character in the book, but, in the movie, he's selfish, volatile and sympathetic only because he's a child dealing with a terrible tragedy. I hope someone takes another crack at filming this novel and doing a better job of it.",1515283200,,863,4.354037267080745
