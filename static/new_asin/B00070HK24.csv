2199187,4,B00070HK24,"Far more than sharing the extended life story of Ziegfeld Follies star Fanny Brice, these two movies really show how Barbra Streisand transformed from a screen novice to a reigning goddess over the course of seven years. When she hit the big screen in 1968's ""Funny Girl"", she became an instant movie legend as master filmmaker William Wyler tailored a launching pad so accommodating to her personality and drive that it becomes apparent only later that the film itself is not terribly exceptional. The first half of the film, by far the best part, is about Brice's fast climb to stardom and her blind infatuation of gambler Nick Arnstein, played with a bit too much continental charm by an overshadowed Omar Sharif. The comparatively dramatic second half is really about the inevitable fate of their relationship. The energy that drives the first half seems to sputter in the second half, and Streisand is left to carry the whole thing to the finish line.

The fact that the story has anything to do with Brice seems purely circumstantial in deference to Streisand's phenomenal talent especially as a first-rank comedienne and the pre-eminent song stylist of her generation. For the latter aspect alone, ""Funny Girl"" is essential viewing, especially for three solo numbers penned by the legendary team of Jule Styne and Bob Merrill (who co-wrote ""Gypsy""). First, as a young wannabe trying to convince Mr. Keeney at the local burlesque house to hire her, Streisand sings ""I'm the Greatest Star"" with an appropriately persistent brassiness that suddenly turns into a dramatic clarion call picking up the percussive momentum of ""Don't Rain on My Parade"" until the song title truly becomes fact and not a boast.

The second song is her anthem, ""People"", sung to an unsurprisingly awestruck Sharif on the darkened Hollywood-phony backlit set of Henry Street, first as an expression of her unrequited love for Arnstein and then more effectively as a solo plea bordering on desperation as she leans against a lamppost. The third number is made breathtaking by the ingenious way that Wyler films her performance of ""Don't Rain on My Parade"" as a montage of fast cuts that leads an Arnstein-chasing Brice to the amazing tugboat finish. The fact that they all occur in the first half makes the second half all the more desultory saved at the end by Streisand's memorably triumphant take on Brice's ""My Man"". These are all indisputably classic movie musical moments.

The remaining numbers are good and mostly a vehicle to show off Streisand's considerable comedy skills - maneuvering roller skates on ""I'd Rather Be Blue (Over You)"", flouncing her dress in front of a nonplussed Ziegfeld on ""Second Hand Rose"", waddling around as a ""pregnant"" bride in the Ziegfeld extravaganza ""His Love Makes Me Beautiful"", accommodating Arnstein's aggressive parlor advances in ""You Are Woman"", and chronicling her happily married state in ""Sadie, Sadie"". That's not to say she is not a fine dramatic actress, just a sometimes rather theatrical one at least in her first film here, as she expresses her heartbreak in a variety of overdone hairstyles and clothes until her seeming vindication at the end. No other actress can express as dexterously the concurrent insecurity, egotism and humor that Streisand in her prime could.

The talent is still very much in evidence, but the spirit has hardened somewhat in ""Funny Lady"", the 1975 sequel which picks up Brice's story during the Depression when the established star struggles financially to preserve her career. Unlike its predecessor, this movie does not provide a character arc which allows us to discover anything new about her character. Instead, director Herbert Ross and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen focus on the turbulent, sometimes comic relationship between the established Brice and her eventual husband, rising impresario Billy Rose. The staccato dialogue between the two, a far cry from the moony worship Brice held for first husband Arnstein in the first movie, is what makes ""Funny Lady"" good light entertainment even though the old-fashioned narrative often feels disjointed and truncated.

Fortunately, in full diva mode as the success-insulated heroine, Streisand is at the top of her game here, and James Caan brings youthful energy to his portrayal of the brash, egotistical Rose. The rest of the actors barely register, including Roddy McDowall as Brice's unctuous assistant and confidante, Ben Vereen who doesn't have a single line of dialogue as entertainer Bert Robbins, and an embalmed-looking Sharif reprising his role as Arnstein this time as a preening, materialistic fortune hunter. What a shame that the swooning love story of the first film reaches such a cynical denouement in this story.

There are songs written for the film by the estimable team of John Kander and Fred Ebb, and they meld nicely with the old, Rose-penned standards presented here. However, some of the production numbers are badly staged, for example, the faux-gospel take on ""(It's Gonna Be a) Great Day"" with a sequin-infested Streisand surrounded by an ensemble of uncoordinated dancers, or the clarion call of ""Let's Hear It for Me"" complete with a roadster and a biplane to replicate the driving rhythm of its obvious inspiration, ""Don't Rain on My Parade"". In fact, there are many ill-used references to ""Funny Girl"" from the opening montage to the overorchestrated refrains of ""People"" when Arnstein kisses Brice.

Moreover, the movie has a constant veneer of excess, especially the overdone Bob Mackie gowns, as if nothing seems rooted in reality. Through all this, Streisand does manage to create some breathtaking musical magic - her sonorous version of ""More Than You Know"" in the recording studio; her torchy, show-stopping lament, ""How Lucky Can You Get"" (although her revealing gown is rather distracting); and best of all, her pristine rendition of the old chestnut, ""If I Love Again"", set against a glass grand piano. These are the pleasures that make the movie worthwhile in spite of its various shortcomings.",1150761600,47,6059,5.13894523326572

2199202,3,B00070HK24,"I don't write comments on products anymore because I don't like being attacked by people who don't agree with me.  And I'm often told that my comments are not reviews.  Ce m'egal.

Funny Girl is my all time favorite musical. For everything about it and especially Streisand.  The jokes and their delivery can't be funnier, I love all the songs (my only gripe with this flick is that so many songs were left out, added ones though great did not make up for that), the story was bare bones but that was enough, the actors and the acting could not be better.  I watched it again yesterday and had a ball.  I thought everything was perfect.  Also it occurred to me that Funny Girl has substance.  That does not mean serious or dull.  It was a delight.  For a couple months I've been buying (sometimes for $3 or $4 apiece, new from sellers on Amazon) old movie musicals and watching them.  Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.  And loving it.  One gripe about that.  Too many of Kelly's flicks co-star Frank Sinatra.  There is nothing about Sinatra I like.  Not his looks, his personalty, his attitude, his acting, his morals or his voice.  So these I don't buy.  And I've seen several movies that sans Sinatra I'd like to watch.  Anyway, the reason I mentioned these truly Hollywood Musicals was to note that while Funny Girl. has substance, the others are all fluff and personality.  I enjoy them intend to go on watching them.

And now Funny Lady.  I hated it and stopped watching when Streisand started ""How Luck Can You Get"".  I sat here for over an hour watching Streisand and Caan yell at each other.  And the arguments were not witty.  I thought the plot, dialog, acting put the real Fanny Brice in a terrible light, and unless she really was an arrogant know it all megalomaniac with a bad disposition, I think this film company should be sued for defamation of character.  I also think it made Streisand look very bad.  Caan stayed loveable and bumbling.  I think Billy Rose only wrote lyrics, but I don't know.  I think Vincent Youmans wrote the music for ""Great Day"" and ""More Than You Know.""  As for ""Great Day"" - that was not 1930s Brice, it was 1970s Streisand, the song was ruined and I hated it. ""Great Day"" is not a murky maudlin weird ballad to be sung by a nearly naked songbird.  It's a rousing, happy, rhythmic, up beat song and dance number.  BTW, I used to have CDs of the Fanny Brice ""Baby Snooks Shows"".  I also had a few CDs or tapes of her singing songs.  And I saw at least one of her flicks.  I like the Snooks show. But in everything else, Streisand was worlds better than Brice - funnier, better voice.  Two questions remain.  How did Keats get his second book published?  And why did Fanny Brice become famous?  I won't buy a difference in styles and taste in Brice's day and Streisand's.  Beautiful voices are beautiful voices whenever they sing.  And funny is funny.  Coward who wrote comedies during Brice's time is still funny and still acted.  Likewise Kaufman and Hart.

Tonight I'm giving this set to someone.  And earlier I ordered (for $4.75) a copy of Funny Girl alone.",1462838400,2,3099,4.484739676840215

Fabulous epic songs, great costumes, fast moving, funny and sad--a Streisand tour de force.  Funny Lady, on the other hand, is not worth viewing.  Sequels are rarely as good as the original, but some are actually embarrassing.  There are a few classic songs by Billy Rose, but the story drags incredibly.

Almost 4.5 hours of movie plus some great extras, this set is a must in any library of vintage musicals and spectacular talents.",1319241600,,343,4.375
2199340,5,B00070HK24,"While I prefer ""The Way We Were"" more, ""Funny Girl"" and it's sequel, ""Funny Lady"", are still pure musical fun with none other but the legendary Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand plays 1910s Broadway sensation Fanny Brice. These two movies practically chronicle her life as one of the Ziegfeld follies all the way to being a Broadway superstar. If you're a fan of these movies, then I suggest you should get this 2-movie pack, which will most likely be cheaper than getting the movies separately.

  ""Funny Girl"" (1968) is two and a half hours of comedy, music, and drama. It chronicles Fanny Brice as one of the Ziegfeld follies, meeting and later on marrying Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), where they have a child named Frances. The first hour of the movie is fun to watch, where Barbra is a ""funny girl"", and about an hour and a half later, the film gets more more serious all the way to it's dramatic ending, where Barbra sings ""My Man"". A few other musical highlighs include ""I'm the Greatest Star"", ""People"" (her hit song), and ""Don't Rain on My Parade"". All together, ""Funny Girl"" is worth repeated viewings. It's a great Oscar-winning musical production.

  ""Funny Lady"" (1975) is two hours of more comedy, music, and drama, and while it's not as good as the original, I still really like it. It picks up right where ""Funny Girl"" left off. It starts off dramatic, with Barbra still shaky over the divorce, and later on, she meets songwriter Billy Rose (James Caan), and he marries her even though they don't quite love each other. It turns from dramatic to funny to dramatic again. The thing about this film is that, unlike the first film, this one actually made me laugh. It was pretty funny, and it had good songs too, including ""How Lucky Can You Get?"", ""Let's Hear it For Me"", and ""I Found a Million Dollar Baby"". ""Funny Lady"" isn't absolutely amazing, but it's still a very good movie.

  Barbra Streisand has a career that's been going on for a half a century, and these movies showcase her extreme musical talent, and both are very good movies that deserve to be seen.",1318118400,9,2081,4.64850136239782
2199341,5,B00070HK24,"A reasonably accurate history of the life of Fanny Brice aka Baby Snooks. Oh, the joy Fanny brought to me in my childhood. She had a hard life, but she was a driven to success. She was an overcomer.

2199342,3,B00070HK24,"My family and I became instant Streisand fans the night we saw ""Hello Dolly"" and have always been big musical fans so I thought I would buy this set that got such great reviews.

I loved Funny Girl, the music, Streisand's acting, and the clean comedy which just seems natural. I would recommend buying it to any musical fans, especially with the huge musical hits in the movie.

Funny Lady on the other hand is a disappointing follow up. The plot for the most part is okay, but the songs aren't spectacular (when there are any), they don't seem natural, and there are just enough to keep it classified as a musical, although Streisand has a few good solos. Over all I would classify the movie as more of a drama than a musical. My main problem is the language and other content though. Everything but the f-bomb is dropped in this movie which contains so many curse words I lost track. Don't get me wrong, I expected this from anything made by Columbia, especially combined with Tri Star in the mid 70's, but I was hoping for the sake of following up a great musical like ""Funny Girl"" that they would clean the sequel up a bit from the rest of their movies. I was very disappointed. Would not recommend this movie for the family, unless you have a decent cuss box that is.

Overall I would recommend, as others have, buying ""Funny Girl"" and renting ""Funny Lady"" if you are curious, like I was, what will happen where ""Funny Girl"" leaves off. I would not recommend buying the set because Funny Lady is one of those movies where it might be good to see but only see once.

Barbra sparkles in her first film and hardly shows any awkwardness in front of the camera (easy enough since she'd already played the role) and she looks amazing. Her poise and confidence plus Fannie's belief in her destiny,make this enjoyable on every level. She's also a superb comedienne as witnessed int the ""Bride"" number which literally brings The Zeigfeild Follies to a screeching halt(much to the chagrin of The Great Zeigfield himself.) The ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" number was greeted with applause when I saw it in a theater,as did many of the other numbers. A great show!
""Funny Lady"" is a bit of a dissappointment only in that some of the roles were miscast(James Caan,though good-looking,was no Billy Rose,who was not)but then neither was Nick Arnstein and Omar Sharif is on board to play him again. There's not as much music in this one although what there is,is great(Marvin Hamlish developed someoriginal works) and Ben Vereen has a cameo as well. A better bet all around than buying them seperately",1237680000,,1083,4.859459459459459
2199349,5,B00070HK24,"I've enjoyed both these movies for a long time and when I saw it in a set, couldn't pass it up.  Barbara Streisand fans will not be disappointed.",1226275200,,145,4.178571428571429
2199350,5,B00070HK24,"Imagine making your first movie and it becoming an instant classic?

Barbra Streisand was already a star of records/ television and, of course, the stage where FUNNY GIRL was first presented.  But could she transfer her quirky, highly exotic looks and original and undefined personality to the screen?

She did and you only have to watch a few minutes of FUNNY GIRL to know that the woman is a star who rightly has earned her place.

From the opening lines to the end where she breaks the rules and does a live performance of ""My Man"", the film clearly belongs to Ms. Streisand.  (Note:  I recall seeing the film at the Criterion theater in NYC during the Christmas holidays in 1969; the management would open up the doors leading to the street for the last five minutes of the reserved seating film.  Would you believe people would wait out in the cold just to hear Barbra sing ""My Man""?  Well they did and that is the kind of star power that makes both FUNNY GIRL and FUNNY LADY nothing short of fantastic.)

Although FUNNY LADY is not the film that FUNNY GIRL is, give it a chance.  Produced in the ""new style"" way of CABARET, the camera got more into the musical numbers so that a bit of the staginess and old fashion charm is lost.  That does not mean that, again, Barbra Streisand does not pull off another major coup.

Good singing/ acting and fantastic family fun.  Who can ask for more?",1219190400,,1395,4.466403162055336
2199351,5,B00070HK24,"This is one of Streisand's best.  I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my 15 year old Granddaughter who loves the old musicals.  Good for the whole family.  ""Funny Girl"" is a must see if you like musicals.",1200528000,,207,4.256410256410256
2199352,4,B00070HK24,"I'm getting this even though I already own ""Funny Girl"". The price for this duo is less than purchasing ""Funny Lady"" DVD alone. The only negative is that the ""Funny Girl"" (only) DVD has a great extra entitled ""Barbra in Movieland"", which is a very entertaining, detailed, well-narrated, behind the scenes short, concentrating on the filming of the musical number, ""Don't Rain on My Parade"". Many DVD ""featurettes"" bore me as mostly everyone interviewed banally talks endlessly about how talented and wonderful everyone else is; how lucky they are to be involved in such a ""profound"" project; etc. This short was obviously produced, possibly as a promotional piece, during or shortly after the actual filming in 1968. An old abandoned railway station in New Jersey is shown being brought back to turn-of-the-20th century-life. Its only current inhabitant, an elderly (real-life) caretaker who has worked at the station for decades, including its more active days as a bustling transportation hub. His presents and occasional comments provide an interesting and nostalgic aspect to the piece He relates going to see the real Fanny Brice years before. William Wyler even gives him a cameo in the scene; But he probably won't go see the film,  ""My wife and I don't get to the movies much anymore"", he says. I've pulled out this DVD a number of times just to watch this extra. I can't say that very often.",1197849600,33,1400,4.957446808510638
2199353,3,B00070HK24,"Funny Girl is Outstanding! Absolutely FIVE STARS! The music is incredible and Barbara is at her all time best.  Barbara recaputures the brillance of her stage role and brings it to the screen. A throughly enjoyable film. And then there is Funny Lady. It can not be said that effort was not put into the making of this sequel, however, it pales by comparrison to the original. The peformances seem forced, the music and songs are just so-so and some of the dance numbers are down right laughable. A true disappointment. The only reason to purchase this two DVD set is to be able to really appreciate just how good the original is and how poor the follow up film is. My recommendation is to definately purchase Funny Girl and rent Funny Lady so you don't waste your money.",1190160000,11,770,4.539568345323741
