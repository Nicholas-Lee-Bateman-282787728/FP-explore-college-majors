8462309,4,B000AARKUI,"Although I own all three box sets of Land of the Lost, I bought this DVD particularly for the Sleestak commentary. I was ssssssssssslightly disssssssssssssapointed. First, on the cover it says that the commentary is for the Fair Trade episode when it is actually on the Blackout episode, but I guessssssssssssssssss it doesn't really matter ssssssssssssssssince I don't sssssssspeak sleestak. I was under the asssssssssssumption when I ordered this DVD that the actor who played the part of the sleestak was going to do commentary when it is actually sssssssssssssssssssomeone hissssssssssssssssing throughout the entire episode, a very evil way to market a ""Best Of"" collection to consumers who have all the episodes already.

  The only reason I gave this DVD four stars is because the episodes on it are all very good. Here they are in order:

1. ""The Sleestak God"" from Season One, The Marshalls' first encounter with the sleestak. ""Yo sareesataka!!""

2. ""Fair Trade""  from Season Two, Will and Holly have to save their dad from the meanie greenies after Rick is accidentally captured by them.

3. ""Blackout"" the final episode from Season Two, Enik asks the Marshalls for help when the sleestak steal a crystal from the matrix table in the second clock pylon and plunge the Land of the Lost into eternal darkness.

4. ""Repairman"" from Season Three, the sleestak are at it again, this time using another matrix table to fry the Marshalls and everything else out of the Land of the Lost.

  If you only want a taste of the Land of the Lost without having to spend the money on the box sets, then buy this DVD. But for the price and the value of what is on the box sets, I highly recommend picking up Seasons One and Two. If you really like those ones then get Season Three, you won't be disappointed (especially if you're in your 30's and watched Land of the Lost on TV in the 70's and 80's, or if you have kids younger than 16).",1129248000,42,1931,4.683431952662722
