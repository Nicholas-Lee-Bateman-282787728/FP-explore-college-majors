994997,3,6305242178,"This film has some good Harley riding by the girl in question, interesting scenery & cinematography and a nice, arty premise, but the psychedelics are annoying and by no means buy the DVD for the nudity. I can't believe this had to be ""extensively cut"" to get an R-rating. Seems to me that it would need a few seconds of trims at MOST and in fact there's nothing I saw here that I haven't seen in other R-rated movies. There isn't a lot of nudity in it and the vast majority is obscured by the psychedelic effects. The resulting footage is mostly no more explicit than a James Bond title sequence. The PG-rated Logan's Run shows off Jenny Agutter just about as much (without being so annoying). I can't help but wonder if this DVD doesn't really contain the cut version, although it doesn't look cut up... I've seen plenty of R-rated ""exploitation flicks"" that were way more revealing.",1061510400,13,885,4.572327044025157
994998,5,6305242178,"In the 60s ""Girl On A Motorcycle"" was payed little attention,did poorly at the box office, and by 1960s standereds was written off as a ""phoney"" an unsucessful attempt by Ronald Duncan and Jack Cardiff at making a movie with a ""mind-boggling anti-sanity"" feel. And if THATS the case and this REALLY was an ""embarrassing attempt"" then they certainly played it off well, didn't they? Disregard all the negitive reviews, Im sure that if this kind of movie was released in today's pathetic film industry of arsty-fartsy posers...it would have been a classic right away and still carry the label of being a cult at the same time.
Girl on A Motorcycle has the 1960s written all over it! Its not brilliant like A Clockwork Orange or Mick Jagger's movie ""Performance"" (Nobody asked but Mick was also Marianne Faithful's love intreast at the time)
When released in 1968 Warner Brothers carried it under the title ""Naked Under Leather"" and was also severely editied to maintain an ""R"" rating~WHICH IS THE MAIN REASON WHY THE MOVIE PROBLEY GOT TRASHED not because it was bad, but because it was so ridiculously cut. Thankfully now you can buy the European verison which shows the whole un-cut thing.
Marianne Faithful (who complety surprised me with her A+ acting skills) stars as a newlywed housewife who wakes up in the middle of the night after an erotic fantasy of her and her ex lover Alain. She realizes Alain's the one she really loves. She puts on her quite small fitting fur-lined leather jump suit (and only wearing the jumpsuit) she takes off in her motorcycle for a long ride though Europe'c country side. Basically on her way, she experiences fantasies about her husband and her ""lover"".
 I did put off watching this movie for quite some-time..it just didn't seem as if would be worth while, but even by its little-know status is still very underrated, im glad i finally got around to it;) If your a fan of the 60s such as (Psych-Out,Valley of the Dolls,Head,Faster Pussycat Kill Kill,Barbarella,Head, or even Mr. Powers (thats AUSTIN Powers) himself...you would enjoy this;)",1009929600,19,2077,4.850704225352112

995169,4,6305242178,"This review is of the Jezebel Blu-ray edition.
A bride of two months decides to leave her husband in France and return to her lover in Germany. The story is told in a stream of consciousness as she makes the journey on a large motorcycle - recalling previous times she has made the same trip. The film is almost all flashback, much in the form of internal voice-over as we see the girl riding along on the bike. The weakest part of the film is it's star, Marianne Faithfull, who was not experienced enough to pull off long stretches of silent ""emoting"" with her thoughts told through voice-over. The informative commentary by director and cinematographer Jack Cardiff indicates that a different (unnamed) actress was scheduled to play the part, but died before filming began. The film is very European in that it deals mostly with the characters' internal thoughts and motives, with relatively little action.
The Blu-ray is a great improvement over the Redemption DVD of a few years ago. The image is sharp and clear, with realistic colors, whereas the older DVD was often dark and murky. This is the full European version of the film, not the cut-down American version.",1408492800,2,1170,4.797029702970297

995232,3,6305242178,"There has never been any other movie, not even ""The Wild One"" nor the dreadful ""Easy Rider"" that has quite conveyed the joy of motorcycle riding as Jack Cardiff's ""The Girl On A Motorcycle."" In the other fliks the actors simply try their best to look cool as they ride their hogs. Cardiff's film has a dizzying forward propulsion to it that is completely absent in other bike epics. Unfortunately, the other element in this gorgeous potboiler is eroticism, and it is in this area where this film suffers a wreck much worse than the car pile-up that ends the story.

The script is told in a voice-over stream-of-conciousness format. And it is very simple (and cliched) plot. A restless young woman (Marianne Faithful), suffering from an acute case of ennui, purposely marries a boring school teacher (Why are school teachers always portrayed as boring in films? Filmmakers should have met some of the ones I came across.) While on a skying holiday she finds herself attracted to a sexy stranger (Alain Delon) who sneaks into her room that night and easily introduces her to the intoxicating ways of unbriddled sex. Later in the story, he comes back for more and even gifts her a Harley as a wedding present. The entire film consists on her long and exhilerating ride across European borders to meet her innamorato and the story (flashbacks and fantasies) unfolds during this motorcycle trip.

For a film like this one to work, there has to be a minimum of chemistry between the leads. Well, it is totally absent here. Oh, Delon as usual exudes sexuality even with his clothes on and his eyes shut. But the film sufers terribly from the unfortunate miscasting of Faithful, a pretty gal, but one that does not register anything but girlish coy joy. Her role requires the kind of free spirited vixen abandonment that someone like Bardot (Delon's French female counterpart) could exude by long distance phone. She follows direction all right, going down on her leading man's abs, contentedly, though discreetly, sniffing his arm pit, and burying her head between his naked legs in post coital contentment. But that is simply it: she is following direction, her body is there, but her brain seems to be some place else. In his audio commentary, director Cardiff informs us that at the time, she was dating Mick Jagger, Maybe that explains it, who knows. But the result is akin to watching a six year old girl wearing her mother's shoes.

Three stars for the gorgeous print on Blu-Ray. As I recall, when I first saw this film as a second bill in a practically empty downtown grind house the print looked greenish, grainy and dull (the latter probably due to an old dim projection bulb - a common malaise in many movie houses). The extras consist of a very sparse and boring comments by Cardiff that contain constant praise for Delon, the Hayley, and the European police cooperation. It takes him about 20 minutes before he even mentions his leading lady, and even then it is only to let us know that she did not know how to ride a bike, something quite obvious on even a cursory first viewing. The music by Les Reed may not be quite Alex North, but it is not John Dankworth either, and helps the film in its fast and furious intoxication with speed. The elements are here: a Harley, leather (by Lanvin! including the helmet!), gobs of psychedelic rendered S&M, if that is your bag. It is a pity about the inept leading lady.",1397260800,5,3417,4.691666666666666

995316,3,6305242178,"Though sexually charged for a film of its time, this flick is very tame by today's standards (even by 70's standards), and is insulting to real motorcycle drivers, as almost none of the cycle scenes involving the actors are authentic. Couple that with Ms. Faithfull's inexperienced acting skills, brief plot that never gets developed and Alain Delon's narcoleptic scenes (and I'm a huge fan of his 60's body of work), what we're left with is a stale, pseudo-psychedelic, scenery-driven European travelogue, some brief nudity, indifferent if not unlikeable characters, and a film that seems longer than its mercifully short running time.

It's not all bad, though, as Jack Cardiff's direction is still spot on for an older icon trying to appeal to the youth culture of the day, which never usually fares well (remember Otto Preminger's 'Skidoo'?) and ultimately ends up an embarassment to their film credits, and his photography is both stunning and breathtaking (he doesn't list himself as cinematographer, but rather photographer, curiously). And Ms. Faithfull's outfit is eye candy for the guys as Delon's presence is similiar for the female audience. Surprisingly, Cardiff's psychedelic colors and pulsating hues are no more embarassing or corny as any other touchstone flick from the late 60's, and work as well as any cultural artifact from that era. Even better than some.

The film would have been better served with a female lead who had more experience or chops; Faithfull's ultimately annoying internal narrative voiceovers are a clear sign of her inability to emote onscreen effectively, and the silly faces of imagined freedom and ecstatic joy have a Stevie Wonder-ish blindness to the fact that she's obviously not paying attention to her driving, in spite of the fact that she's fiercly tearing up the Autobahn at frenetic speeds at a considerable cost to her as the film advances.

As a cult curiosity, it's worth a viewing, but won't bear repeated viewings for most. But the same could be said for most films regardless of time periods, so sixties bashing is a moot point. My tolerance for the tedious concerning 60's films is legendary, yet I found it overstaying its welcome as I clock-watched the last 15 minutes waiting for the inevitable outcome.

The blu-ray is generally a decent upgrade - there are still soft spots and grit on many internal and nocturnal scenes, and the remastering draws attention to the actors standing in front of background screens rather than being a part of the action, but the spectacular ariel footage and multi-country locations of old-world Europe are a treasure to behold. So you'll have to decide for yourself if seeing expert Euro-vacation footage, Ms. Faithfull's nudity and outfits, some great motorcycle scenes and psych-celluloid silliness are enough to warrant your time and casual attention. 3 stars.",1370304000,3,2861,5.146236559139785

995320,3,6305242178,"Jack Cardiff, one of the world's most talented cinematographers (""The Red Shoes"", ""The African Queen"", ""Pandora and the Flying Dutchmen"", ""Black Narcissus"") was a multi-talented individual when it comes to cinema.  Editor, actor, visual effects and even director.

While hi films ""Sons and Lovers"" and mystery films ""Intent to Kill"" and ""Web of Evidence"" were successful, in the late '60s, Cardiff would work on a British-French film titled ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"", an adaptation of the novella ""La Motocyclette"" by Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues.

A film that would star popular French actor Alain Delon (""Le Samourai"", ""Le Cercle Rouge"", ""L'Eclisse"", ""Rocco and His Brothers"") and singer/songwriter/actres Marianne Faithful (best known in the late '60s as being the girlfriend of the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and her wild lifestyle).

While the film would feature Alain Delon as a headliner, the film is mostly connected to Marianne Faithful, as the film would be known for the skin tight body suit that she wore in the film, and heighten her popularity as a sexy, wild diva.

And now ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" receives its HD release on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber as part of their ""Jezebel"" line.

VIDEO:

Jack Cardiff is known for his use of color, especially for Technicolor films and experimentation of film throughout his career.  With ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"", Jack Cardiff was not only the director but also the cinematographer and there is no doubt that this film was a sign of the times, in this case...the hippie driven late '60s.  While I'm not sure if Cardiff partaken in any of the drugs that ran rampant at the time, there is no doubt that he was in touch with the psychedelic colors and wild cinematography experimented with at the time.

Suffice to say, ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" can be described in one word... ""Trippy"".  From intriguing color selections and colors, I have no doubt if this film was a cult-classic among those who experimented with narcotics (similar to how Disney's ""Fantasia"" was a popular among LSD and acid-freaks at the time).  And these ""trippy"" images are a product of Rebecca's wild dreams and thoughts of her being seduced or sexually ravaged by Daniel.

As for video quality, Kino Lorber is known for not messing around with original negative and going through expensive restoration.  The film's grain is quite evident, there are some specks but no doubt this film is probably the definitive version to own of the film at this time due to it being in HD and having better clarity.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Girl on the Motorcycle"" is presented in monaural but via a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track.  While much better than a straight on monaural track from the center channel, the film does sport a soundtrack with music of the time and also clear dialogue.  As well as emphasizing the motorcycle sounds as well.  While not immersive, it's pretty much on spot with a lot of the audio of films of that era, but sounds much better in lossless.

Unfortunately, there are no subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" comes with the following special features:

  Theatrical Trailer - (:50) The theatrical trailer for ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"".
  Gallery - Featuring nearly two dozen stills and posters from ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" is a fascinating film that was no doubt a sign of the time.  During the hippie era, where sexual exploration was the norm, Marianne Faithfull was truly a sex symbol of the time and also a product of that group of people who loved having sex.

Faithfull was never shy about talking about this, similar to her character Rebecca, Faithfull left her husband and made it a goal to have sexual relations with a Rolling Stone member and in fact, she had sexual relations with three of them and ended up choosing Mick Jagger.

While Faithfull is no doubt a sexy symbol and the strong sexual urges that she has within the entire film is the primary part of the storyline, Faithfull is probably one of those actresses that many loved to look at and not too concerned of how she acted.  Based on her acting in this film, suffice to say, it wasn't that good.  But it's almost compared to a lot of sex symbols on films today, does anyone really watch them on film for their acting?

If anything, watching Faithfull daydream on her motorcycle while getting turned on by her sexual thoughts of Daniel, you wonder if this is a dreamstate (because the last thing anyone wants to do is daydream for long stretches of time while riding quickly on a highway).

But ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" was not exactly a film that was going to celebrate Marianne Faithfull's acting, it was a film showcasing her sexiness.  It was a film that would showcase Alain Delon, not as a gun toting action star but a man who lived dangerously by showing Rebecca pleasures that she had never known.  And of course, that is where director and cinematographer Jack Cardiff comes in, to work his magic in making sure these dreams and thoughts were wild, trippy but suitable for that era in time.  And who best to experiment on psychedelic colors and dreams than Jack Cardiff.

While the film is not great by any means, it is a fascinating film about sexuality in the late '60s and this is probably the best film I have seen Marianne Faithful, although I did enjoy her brief appearance on Jean-Luc Godard's 1966 film ""Made in U.S.A."" and also her appearance on the BBC series ""Absolutely Fabulous"", her role in ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" is primarily about her and it is no doubt a titillating film.

As for Alain Delon, he is no doubt a great actor, but compared to the many wonderful films that he starred in his entire career, this relationship between his character, Daniel and Rebecca was quite intriguing, especially compared to his other films with relationships such as ""L'Eclisse"" or ""Le Samourai"". Also, it's a film where Delon is not the primary character in the film.

Some people may have been turned off by this back in the '60s, especially since Delon gets top billing but I suppose this film wanted to give Marianne Faithfull that big break as an actress.

Once again, this film could have been terrible but I feel that Jack Cardiff's cinematography experience and editing skills made this film a bit better because of his involvement and experimentation.  It's not a great film but it is enjoyable to a point and to tell you the truth, with all the daydreaming she goes through while riding her motorcycle, when I first watched it, all that went in my mind was...""this young woman is going to die if she doesn't pay attention to the road"".  It's not a a groundbreaking film, so one shouldn't have any high hopes of expecting a deep storyline.

As for the Blu-ray release, this is the definitive version of this film to own.  The video quality is much better and as far as DVD releases, the previous version only had a trailer and stills gallery as this current Kino Lorber Blu-ray release, but it makes up for better picture quality and lossless audio.  Also, this is the full version.  A lot of nudity, sexual scenes and adult content which led to the film receiving an ""X"" rating for that time, is quite mild for today's films.

Overall, ""The Girl on a Motorcycle"" is a film that is sexually-charged and for its time, considered dangerous and too sexy for audiences.  But for today's audience, one may see it more of a film that is a product of its time.  Sexual repression, masochistic and sexual urges, all coming from a single woman in a skintight body suit.

995379,5,6305242178,"I had never even heard of this movie until a week or two ago.  I rented it off of Netflix, and I watched it last night.  Even though I've committed myself to buying fewer DVDs in this era where streaming movies is possible, I can tell you for sure I'm buying this for my collection of classic movies.

Marianne Faithfull is captivating as a young woman who is reckoning with herself about several aspects of her life.  She has married someone she doesn't love, and she now realizes her mistake.  She hops on her bad motorscooter and is riding back to the man she does love.  But as she rides she remembers that he doesn't really love her. He doesn't really believe in love or marriage at all. The dilemma for her is painful and apparently insurmountable. We hear her inner thoughts and regret as she rides.  She utterly hates the man she totally loves.  And she feels deep affection and admiration for her husband, the man for whom she has no love or attraction.

Yes: this is an amazing motorcycle movie.  If you want to watch this only to see a gorgeous woman in a black one-piece leather riding suit  (with no panties underneath, we learn early on!) on a beautiful Harley  (I think it was a Harley, they blacked out the nameplate on the tank, but I could see ""Electra"" on the front fender, in classic Harley style), you will be amply rewarded. She roars the bike across seemingly hundreds of miles of beautiful European scenery.  It is a feast for the eyes.  The bike in this film is powerfully iconic. It reminded me of Black Beauty--it has a keen cognition. It is second only to Marianne in terms of stealing the scenes and being a character.  You will want to get on a bike very badly after seeing this, even if you've never ridden before.  She did seem to ride too fast, but that was only a result of her emotional anguish.  She'll get there okay, won't she??

I immediately recognized the superior cinematography, and when I researched this movie I learned why: the director/cinematographer, Jack Cardiff, is world-renowned, having worked on numerous classic movies, including African Queen and Black Narcissus.  You can immediately see his influence on this....it is amazingly filmed, with many psychedelic sixties flourishes reflecting the era in which this was made.

The ending is sobering, but adds to the power of the movie.  It is just very strange that this movie had escaped my attention for all these years, because I definitely focus on music, art, culture from the sixties, and as a major Rolling Stones fan I know quite a bit about the amazing Marianne Faithfull.  But I did not know that she was in a movie of this importance. Check out Marianne in ""The Rolling Stones' Rock and Roll Circus"" (DVD--a fund-raising circus-themed concert in London) from about the same period of time.  She sings a song while wearing this beautiful gown--it is elegance of the highest order. She's no mere groupie, she is a major talent and Renaissance woman. Even though she got hooked by the needle for some period of time, she is truly an impressive person with a very interesting legacy. Marianne strikes me as an amalgam of Bardot, Lady Diana, and Marilyn Monroe--there's something sexy, innocent, and tragic combined in her persona.

This film will stay with you.  It may make you want to buy a motorcycle--I've been yearning to ride mine all day.  But, perhaps, you might be well-advised to stay off it for awhile if you are brooding over romantic regrets.",1335398400,5,3465,4.676567656765677
995380,4,6305242178,"Faithfull's Rebecca is a girl just married who has a lover on the side.  The movie is played as a back story told through a journey on her motorcycle (a wedding gift from said lover) on her way to see him.  There's lots of riding in front of a green screen (some of it looking really silly), lots of flashbacks, lots of Rebecca narrating her own thoughts on her situation...the narration makes up the lion's share of the film.

There's also lots of beautiful scenery and a breathtaking bit of cinematography where Rebecca first enters Germany.  The camera centers on the bike from afar as it quickly travels, peeking in and out of the green blur of trees, centered at speed.  It's just beautiful.

Volkswagen fans should take note of all the old 60's VW's and Audi's on the German street scenes.  Might alone be worth the bother of picking this up.

The scenery helps the relatively light story, and overall looks pretty great on this Blu-ray.  There are some soft scenes, but I'm pretty happy with it.",1335312000,3,1002,4.584269662921348

First off Ms. Faithfull... is not (faithfull) but she is easy to look at.  I think the original title was Naked Under Leather which of course would make it banned in the USA!

995383,4,6305242178,"Marianne Faithfull is exquisite, but as other reviewers have hinted she does not take easily to a motorcycle.  She gets better as the movie goes along, but until then her voiceover is way, way embarrassing when she speaks of her passion for the motorbike and how it makes her free and how her husband, the sap, would never understand her.  At times the v.o. reaches heights and depths Marguerite Duras might have envied, and that's not entirely a compliment.  Faithfull is always wonderful to look at, and Jack Cardiff must have been physically enamored of her, he makes her look so sexy.  I loved seeing her in that 360 degree pan and I wondered how this was accomplished in the age before computer generated effects, likewise for the opening circus nightmare in which Faithfull, as the unfaithful bride Rebecca, is shown standing on the back of a cantering horse parading around a one-ring circus, while Alain Delon in ringmaster garb snaps the leather off of her body piece by piece.  I'm like, how is this happening?

I don't remember where Marianne Faithfull's ancestors came from, but this is one international coproduction where you're thinking, too bad she has to pretend to be French in this--or is she English?  Or German, or Swiss?  She doesn't really try to be anything other than Marianne Faithfull in leather.  Her husband wasn't too bad, except modern orthodontics would have given him perhaps a half an inch more gum: when he pulls up his lip you see no gum at all, just teeth the length of piano keys.  Alain Delon, as the professor Rebecca falls for, is charming when he wants to be, callous when he wants to be, and always cute as a Beatle.  His looks would be popular all over again today.  He could play on Gossip Girl with that remarkable face.  No wonder Romy Schneider broke her heart over him, Nico too, Visconti as well.  Is he still alive?  We know that Marianne roughened up her image to gain critical viability, did he have to do the same?

Cardiff died within the last few months, aged 94.  (The new issue of Cinema Retro has a cool interview with him regarding his work with Errol Flynn on the neverfinished ""William Tell"" film.)  The movies he directed, those of them I've seen, are a mixed bag, but in Girl with a Motorcycle he brings to the project the same passion for gorgeous women that distinguished his contributions to others' films, including The Red Shoes, Marilyn Monroe in The Prince and the Showgirl, Leslie Caron in Fanny, and of course Ava Gardner in Barefoot Contessa and Pandora and the Flying Dutchman.  Girl on a Motorcycle isn't perhaps very dramatically satisfying, but it is a great showcase for his star.

Oh, the ski chalet scene--ten stars!  And Faithfull's Lanvin wardrobe--a knockout!",1268524800,,2743,4.732631578947369

995385,3,6305242178,"Marianne Faithful plays a bored housewife, who decides to leave her husband, and ride a motorcycle throughout the European countryside. She'd been having a steamy affair with a handsome, virile man, who she considers way more exciting than her milquetoast spouse. So, she takes off with her paramour to find herself, and lead what she hopes is a more fulfilling life.

It was unusual for a young woman to take to the road by herself, back in the 60s. So in this way, this film was unique in it's day. It does have an overabundance of psychedelic special effects, throughout the course of the movie. This was customary for many 60s films, but it was overdone here, and had a distracting effect that was irritating.

Marianne Faithful looks ravishing in her full-body leather biker gear. She has a good-looking, but rather wan face. I thought a more robust-looking actress, who could project a more fiery temperament than Marianne, would've been more appropriate in the lead role. Marianne just seemed too ethereal, to be a rebellious biker gal.

The movie has a snazzy concept. But, it also has a lackluster quality, that ruins the overall premise of the plot. The pace of the film, is far too slow and boring, for a film about a devil-may-care girl biker.

995437,2,6305242178,"Despite the speedy opening credits sequence that promise all sorts of fun, ""Girl On A Motorcycle"" immediately slows to an art house crawl and keeps that pace throughout the entire film. Straddling ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" and ""Easy Rider"", it's a European psychedelic road movie which ultimately plays as a quirky, but flawed period piece.

Marianne Faithful (yes, Mick Jagger's old girlfriend) plays Rebecca, a newlywed who ditches her nebbish husband Raymond (Roger Mutton) in favor of a handsome, but cold lover Daniel (Alain Delon). She dons her Barbarella-like leather jump suit and revs down the highway as she recalls in flashbacks her experiences in and out of bed with Daniel, which all end up being distractingly psychedelic (and woefully dated). This was probably radical behavior back then, but now seem largely tame by today's standards.

In between the endless shots of Faithful daydreaming on her hog, there is some truly gorgeous camera work. But the weight of the film is placed squarely on the slim shoulders of Faithful, and despite her alluring looks and stunning body, her presence can't quite carry the film as it plods along to it's thudding end.

The DVD quality is below average, but watchable; not much cash was put into restoration. The extras are average: the trailer is more entertaining than the film, giving an adrenalized vision of what might have been, as well as commentary from the director.

""Girl On A Motorcycle"" is so mixed up as to what it wants to be (Star vehicle? Symbolist art house film? Free spirited feminist tome?) it never quite delivers the goods.

995441,4,6305242178,"I'm not too familiar with the specifics of Faithfull's upbringing, or lack thereof, but I did find this to be a rather autobiographical fare at best. It's a rather deep look at her character's life, and how it seemed to be pararelling her own. The first scene has her dreaming of being in a circus performing in a leather motorcycle suit, and a person as her husband is whipping her, and the children are laughing at him and her, and then there's a man in a chair who looked like a psychologist who was laughing at her. I found all of this intriguing as you could say that the psychologist was acting like: ""We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives."" Hence the laughing. I am still trying to learn this as after living life as a victim all these years, and being raised to believe that there's a good person and bad person, and that there's a right way and a wrong way, and those who do wrong are bad, and the victims are good. I see that when Faithfull puts on her suit, and rides away on her motorcycle, and tries to find herself. The question is: ""What Is Herself?"" She was married to a school teacher, but it turns out to be a loveless marriage as he is too reasonable, and too wishy-washy in her eyes. He may had been the best thing for her, but she'll never know. She left him to go join a man who turned her on in everyway, and including the motorcycle. Had she had a happy life would she had turn to the motorcycle the way she did? Well as I said this could very well be her life story as she had a father who seemed wrapped up in books, and was rather distant towards her, and Faithfull was brought up in a Utopian Commune, and her father was a lover of words. Perhaps that's why she married her husband because he was a school teacher, and perhaps why she was going to her lover the one who turned her onto the motorcycle as he was also into words, but not as much as her husband. Faithfull's character seemed as though she was trying to free herself from the chains of her father, but wanted a man who was like her father in the sense he had a spine in which was a quality or trait that appealed to her, but not to be critical of her. Her husband was not critical of her, but he was also spineless as he didn't even question it when her lover gave her a motorcycle for a wedding gift. Her lover pleases her in every way, but he lost his first wife in a crash, and since then emotionally he was devoid of love for another woman, and just used Faithfull's character to get by pretty much, and what more he knew she'd come to him, and that was probably why she ran away because her lover was right. He knew he pleased her, and so with her needs she would come to him. In the end she tried to focus more on the bike as she knew she would not have a future with either man, and she certainly didn't want to go home to a father who was going to chastise her, and make her feel stupid for having an affair with a man before she was supposed to be married to her boyfriend. She focused on the motorcycle as the link to her lover, and she rode it till death did they part. Faithfull's character is a product of a person who's parents didn't make children feel loved.....especially when a parent died. Here's some for example:

1. Scrooge: His mother died while giving birth to him, and his father never forgave him, so he shut down, and focused on making a success of himself to atone for his self-esteem that was shattered by his father because of bitterness.

2. Jenny: From ""Forrest Gump"". After the death of her mother her father began to rape her something awful to where she pretty much had run away from the man who trully loved her, and would get herself in one scrape after another in a quest to find herself.

3. Forrest: He spent his life pursuing the love of his life only to have her turn him away everytime, and so with everything bad in his life weighing heavilly down upon him he would spend three and a half years of his life running back and forth across the U.S. and in some ways it helped him to come home to himself. This is what I do with my reviews.

I know that this could've inspired ""Easy Rider"", and to me it's a better vehicle than ""Easy Rider"". The use of flashbacks, and dreams were done rather well in this movie, and the colors also were used splendidly in the sex scenes, and the scenes of euphoria. I also feel that something else is noteworthy, and that's the acting job where it's done in the second person alot. This is an intriging and underrated movie that is a good self-examination film. Fortunately, Faithfull's life did not turn out the way her character's did in this film.",1160697600,13,4634,4.2209695603156705
995442,5,6305242178,"Imagine Diana Rigg joining ""Easy Rider's"" Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda for a ride across France and Germany and you will have a pretty good idea what ""Girl on a Motorcycle"" looks like. Made one year before ""Easy Rider""; this is an amazing 1960's road movie that includes hip camera angles, groovy music, a leather suit and a Harley Super Glide.

While low-budget, it is not a thrown together ""B"" Movie but a thoughtful existential trip inside the mind of a flawed character who happens to be a sexy woman. On close examination, what appears to be yet another fruitless examination of the mysteries of female discontent is really a more expansive study of the human condition. Rebecca, the main character, illustrates life as a process of choosing between comfortable security and the need for freedom and excitement; a daily struggle with guilt and its consequent self-destructiveness, and the seductive lure of risk. Motivations familiar to almost all serious motorcycle riders.

In voice-over, Marianne Faithful gives us Rebecca's story in a series of flashbacks, with minimal scenes of conventional dialogue. Most of these work very well although there is a ski weekend flashback about midway through the film that looks more like a travel advertisement than a movie scene. And while much of Jack Cardiff's film is beautifully shot, the action sequences are somewhat clumsy looking and obviously low budget. And there is excessive reliance on the Elvis movie technique of projecting moving scenery(shot by the second unit) with the star pretending to be cruising along the road while actually stationary in the studio.

Cardiff was very creative with the editing and came up with some great match cuts, typically used to bring Faithful out of her frequent flashbacks/dreams. In one we see her lover slowing pulling open the zipper of her suit, then the film cuts to the tread of an Army tank moving past the place where she has been napping by her motorcycle.

Cardiff's technique was quite revolutionary at the time as his camera has a love affair with the leather suit , the motorcycle, and Faithful's eyes. His extensive use of very tight shots is extremely effective and the most pleasing thing about the film.

Faithful is on screen in almost all the scenes and gives a surprisingly good performance. Alain Delon as her lover gets a fair about of screen time (all in flashbacks). I've not been able to take Delon seriously as an actor since his performance as a character named ""Baldy"" in Dean Martin's ""Texas Across the River"" in 1966. Plus I get him confused with Jorge Rivero and his almost identical character ""Capt. Pierre Cordona aka Frenchy"" in ""Rio Lobo"". Maybe they are the same person and used two names as a tax dodge.

Both the VHS tape and the DVD include a nice stills gallery and a couple trailers.

All in all I recommend this film. It has thoughtful themes and many well-shot scenes. If you like motorcycles, a sexy body in and out of a leather suit, the most beautiful eyes ever, and cute freckles you should view this film.

995443,3,6305242178,"This is NOT a really good film.  It IS amusing and entertaining.  The motorcycle scenes are not blue screened, which helps a lot.  Marianne Faithful, a former Mick Jagger lover, stars in this, and there are a few naked shots, but nothing to write home about by todays standards.  Certainly not enough to earn an ""X"" rating as it did on release in the US.  The sound is nice for mono, and the Harley actually sounds like a Harley, something that you do not always get in movies.  There is a lot of pshycadelic footage that may have been really trippy in the 60s, but looks really dated today.

Ms. Faithful is acceptable as an actress, with a running voice-over through much of the film.  She isn't great however, and some of the lines make me laugh.  When she takes off to go see her lover and cheat on wimpy hubby (think Satan's lover Chris from South Park), she starts the Harley and yells, ""I turn myself on!""  When I'm riding my own bikes around, this sometimes pops into my head and I yell it out loud (ONLY if wearing a full face helmet) and crack myself up.

There are some nice touches.  The film is shot very dark while The Girl is in France where she lives with her husband, but once she enters her lover's country, Germany, everything becomes much more vivid and beautiful.  There is also one nice 360 shot of The Girl on the motorcycle.  Not exactly Matrix, but still, at least they tried.

The pacing is a little slow, and it seems to last longer than its running time.  Its one of those movies (not films) where you can read a magazine while you watch.  If you take Girl on a Motorcycle for what it is - a fun but dated movie from the 60s - it is a nice enough diversion.
