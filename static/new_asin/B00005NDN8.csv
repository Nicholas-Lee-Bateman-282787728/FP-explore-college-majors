7946731,5,B00005NDN8,"First Russian experimental film from the short period of ""free market economy"" experiment in the 60's. ""White Desert Sun"" became instant and most successful classic of Russian comedy action films. Almost every line from this movie became known, remembered and repeated zillions of times. This is a film legend which every Russian loves and remembers.
Russian Civil War is over (mid 20's). ""Tovarisch Suhov"", a life smart Russian soldier, walking thru the southern desert back home. Blood thirsty Abdulla with his ""gang"" looking for his lost harem. Honest and kind of cute in his own way former customs officer Vereschagin get stock with his ""good house, good wife ... and what else do you need to meet your old age"". Clumsy green soldier Petruha. Said, who always shows up from nowhere when the shooting occurs. Gulchatai, the cutest and youngest girl from Abdulla's harem. All of them cross Suhov's path and ""stick around"".
Finally this film is available in US format and I can't wait to se it on DVD. This VHS copy doesn't have subtitles and I don't think it is possible to translate this film without losing the flavor of the Russian humor.
If you like this film, you will like ""At Home Among Strangers, a Stranger Among His Own"" (1973).
