896682,5,6304551061,"This is a great video,i have done a little the moment i got it,but i can tell it is very good and above all effective. Norris is a great person,athlete,explains all and simple every step in the tape and he loves  to teach women his knowledge in order to defend themselves more  effectively. He is a perfect person,sweet and caring and a rare master!",937267200,6,349,4.4375
896683,4,6304551061,"Chuck Norris teaches good beginning self-defense techniques - punches, kicks, and more. The video is 3 parts: Instructional (1 hour), Work-Out/Review (22 minutes), and Advanced Demonstration (5-10  minutes).
After going through the instructional part once, I was able to  pick up on the techniques fairly easily, and practice often with the 2nd  part - the workout.  I find the workout to be very aerobic/cardiovascular,  while practicing self-defense techniques.
I would have given this video 5  stars, except that after seeing the advanced demonstration, I wanted Chuck  to teach me more.  He mentioned that they would be in later videos, but, to  my knowledge there are no later videos.  (I believe this was filmed in  1993. Maybe ""Walker"" is the reason.)
Chuck, PLEASE GIVE US MORE  INSTRUCTIONAL TAPES!!!
It's still a worthwile tape! Good deal from  Amazon, as I have seen it as high as $39.95 elsewhere.",916272000,10,909,5.1438356164383565
896777,5,6304551061,I got the video from the library and found it easy to do and I learned how to defend myself from an intruder or someone who wants to to bodily harm to me.,1117929600,,154,3.696969696969697
896778,5,6304551061,Mr. Norris does a wonderful job in explaining exactly how to do the workout.  He is a great teacher.  Move's very slow for the beginner and then steps up the speed as you progress.  Wish there were more of his tapes like this.,1112918400,,226,4.209302325581396
896779,5,6304551061,"This program was better then I could have hoped for. He is very detailed in his instructions, teaching many martial arts punches such as punching, jabing, palm strikes, spear hands & even elbow strikes & kicks such as front, round & side. He always makes sure of the most important, use of hips & blance & not locking joints. He spends a few minutes demonstrating slowly a punch or kick & then a couple of minutes practicing that move with BOTH sides of the body. After 1 hand & 1 kick demonstration/practice, he then demonstrates combinations just learned to use for an assailant and then spends several minutes practicing it. This continues for an hour. It is great he incorporates use of combinations to learn for muscle memory.

The workout is more practice of 22 minutes. He does still speak, but where else can you get a DVD where they pay to have the instructor show you over & over again to make sure you keep at it & really learn it? Not just see it once, practice for 1 minute & the video is over & you forget everything. You do want him to speak: form & balance is the most important & when you're first learning, it's the first thing you will be sloppy on & will compromise your ability the most, not to mention cause muscle & joint injury & lose balance. This DVD runs exactly how a real martial arts class would be run.

There is about a 5-10 minute demonstration of more advanced moves such as spining kicks, fake turns, etc. Which is what everyone thinks looks cool, but don't realize it's there in case you strike wrong & how to keep going. He makes it look VERY easy & he has SO much fun doing it. He also has a female student using the techniques learned on a stunt man (Mr. Norris is VERY happy it wasn't him LOL) with also some nice advanced moves that inspires you to want to learn more.

The only bad things I could say was the 80s type set, the bad music, everyone dressed in leotards, and all the women forced to wear too much makeup & looking brain-dead except for a few. But even the most vacant woman when demonstrated with Mr. Norris, didn't seem to know when to stop before crushing her knuckles in his face hard & he had to keep grabbing her wrist in time. Even I'd want her on my side in a fight, she looked ""blood-thirsty"" as he said.

Since all my faults have to do with what is the director's & producer's fault & not with the information provided, they layout or Mr. Norris's teaching ability, I would happily reccomend this to anyone.",1104278400,10,2471,4.341991341991342
896780,5,6304551061,"This DVD can be broken into three segments:
I.  Demonstration
Brilliantly demonstrated by six-time world champion Chuck Norris.
His students are three able students of varying experience.  All three help the viewer learn the technigues.
The instructions include basic self-defense and disabling moves that every PERSON, not just women, should know.  (Sadly, the idea that this DVD is for women is prevalent).
Each of the moves is understood quickly, then you practice them.
II.  Cardio-Karate Workout.
Frankly, don't think of this as your cardio training.  Just add this to whatever you do.  Because this portion is shown still incorporating some instruction, it moves a little slow.  But in practice, you could extend the workout for your practice.  Obviously, as with any activity, you must practice the moves.
III.  Martial Arts Demonstration
This section features advanced moves from Mr. Norris.  It is very interesting.
This DVD should be required viewing for EVERYONE!  Every parent should require their children to not just watch this but to practice the moves.  Also, for many children this could become a gateway to the martial arts.
Mr. Norris should get involved with the White House, and use this DVD for instruction in schools as part of gym class.
Please purchase it.",1073779200,13,1281,5.195121951219512
896781,5,6304551061,"This DVD is an excellent summary of basic striking techniques.  There is a 22 minute kickboxing aerobic segment and a demonstration section.  The lessons are organized with a demonstration with pointers for each technique, a practice, and then a practice with a combination.  The DVD menu has each technique broken down into chapters.  This allows you to work on the techniques you need to improve on and allows you to program your workout.
This DVD is aimed at women for self defense.  I recommend this video for anyone wanting a good review of basic striking techniques for either self defense or for fitness kickboxing.  I do not recomend this video for a cardio workout due to the short length of the workout segment.  This DVD is also a good value compared to the other products considering the length of the DVD, the quality of instruction, and of course watching Mr. Norris teach.",992563200,3,887,4.796052631578948
896782,4,6304551061,"There are several things that I really enjoyed about this DVD.
First of all is Mr. Norris himself.  His demeanor and teaching style is open, relaxed, yet challenging.  This is a great ""start your day"" routine.  Chuck is a wonderful instructor and his ""calm energy"" works very well to bring your body and mind into state of preparedness for the day.
This is a particularly good upper body workout.  I was very sore in areas not usually felt with most of my work out routines.  Women will especially appreciate the shoulder and upper arm strengthing this routine affords.  I was very impressed with the detailed instruction with respect to the self defense postures and movements and plan to incorporate these into my everyday ""practice"" until they become second nature.
Finally, the ""demonstrations"" were inspiring and, well frankly after watching Mr. Norris, I realized I had almost forgotton what a true martial arts expert he is!  Fun to watch.",983404800,8,946,4.949367088607595
896783,5,6304551061,"I bought this exercise DVD because I was tired of the silly routines that other videos put you through.  This tape/DVD is truly different.  First, Chuck Norris is in his element.  He's a good teacher.  He instructs with enthusiasm.  Forget what you've seen on ""Walker, Texas Ranger"".  This is his forte.  The first part of the tape is a lesson on punches and kicks.  Second, he really wants women to learn these moves so they (we) could defend ourselves.  His sincerity is endearing.  Then, when he demonstrates the moves at full speed...Wow!  You get pumped up!  You want to try it and you feel empowered when you do.  I'm so glad I found this tape.

7873863,5,6304551061,"Total rewind/fastforward VHS Time: 1 hr 57 mins.

1. Introduction 1.5 mins
2. Self-Defence/Confrontation Instruction 76 minutes
3. Practice Session 23 mins
4. Partner Training Techniques/Demonstration (demonstrated with Benny and Sarah Urquidez and Rodger the attacker ) 7 mins

What an awesome learn at home self-defense training video. Im so glad I purchased this. Id inititally purchased it for my teenage daughter after reading all the great reviews and decided it might be the one for her, well it is just that and alot more, I'll be doing the workout with or without her from now on.

1. The Self-Defence Instruction is actually 76 mins and not 60 as advertised on the cover. Chuck's instructions are very indepth and informative. Its a self defence course based on what to do if someone approachs to attack you.

Chuck fully demonstrates and explains each of his moves, tells you how to stand, move, how to punch, elbow, kick and where to strike and even why.
All the moves are explained, shown slowly at first with you copying, then repeat a few times until you progress to do them faster and strike with near full force.

A chair is required for part of the instruction.

2. The 23 minute workout (advertised as 22) is a practice session of what you've learnt, which if done regularly you'd definately be able to tone up at the same time as practising your defence moves.

3. The Partner Training Techniques/Demonstration is 7 minutes of Chuck and his assistants showing you how you can practice your moves with a partner.

Of course you may of read somewhere that Chuck does his famous Spin-Kicks, yeap he does but its part of the demonstration of what can be done if you team up.

This is definately a worth while demonstration to watch, it would be great for someone else to spa with and be shown how they can assist in your training. Or you could just to see how the moves can actually be used to take someone down in the need of safety.

Overall thoughts:

Absolutely awesome...

You get a great workout if you can manage to do the entire Instruction and Practice Session which is 99 minutes long.

The self-defence moves are something you'd pay hundreds of dollars for at a gym to learn over months and guaranteed the instructor wouldnt give you a video to take home so you can practice what you need to know (I know I'd leave and forget everything I was shown due to embarrasment of my clumsines).

Go ahead and get a copy before they become obselite.

Pity Chuck stopped at one Private Lesson, I want more...

Honestly OUT goes all my exercise and other self-defence rubbish, this VHS, a chair and boxing bag or my daughter to spa with is all I need to fullfill all my needs.",1304467200,2,2692,4.612159329140461
7873864,4,6304551061,"This is the Volume 2 addition to Chuck Norris Private Lesson: Basic Self-Defense Instruction (the tape has Volume 2 on the sticker).

Although it was originally listed as a 60 minute high aerobics workout VHS it's only 22 mintues of workout and thats all, there is nothing else on the tape.

I wouldnt call it an aerobics workout though, its a repetative video of how to defend yourself and after 22 mintutes of repeating the moves continuously you should hopefully start to remember them over time and get a workout from doing it, Chuck and his pink tight clad ladies sure are sweating by the end of it.

Chuck states at the begininng of the video that its an Instruction Self Defence Workout which will not only teaches you how to defend yourself but also gives you a workout which strengthens muscles etc, after viewing it twice I believe the first part for sure, it will be an awesome home self defence instructional video.

I haven't tried the workout yet, but I will and am sure I'll use it quite often but without the sound.

The workout includes alot of self defence arm, elbow and kick movements which after 22 mintues Im thinking Id probably be sweating alot more than Chuck and his girls.

The only thing I disliked is Chuck repeating the words ""strike, huck, break and shatter"", I had to mute the sound after a very short period of time.

I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to learn self defence in the privacy of their own home. Im so impressed with the repeditiveness of the moves that Ive purchased Chuck Norris Private Lesson the Lean and Mean Workout in hope this has the 60 minutes of Martial Arts Instruction (this I'll also review when it arrives) and if it doesnt have it I'll be purchasing the other self titled Chuck Norris - Private Lesson available.",1303257600,,1788,4.56875
7873865,4,6304551061,"The standards impressed these days on martial arts, with such widespread exposure of different fighting methods and an endless stream of ""experts"" presenting a dizzying array of styles and techniques on the Internet, may skew the initial opinion of the casual viewer negatively.

This is basic traditional instruction in a modern dojang environment. The basic stances, blocks, punches, and kicks are just what the beginner needs to start building a working knowledge of Karate, or Tae Kwon Do.  Self defense techniques and forms vary more as students advance, and in any case, should not be undertaken without formal personal instruction.  But this video provides a structure and reference for many of the fundamentals and a good workout that any serious beginner, or even advanced student, can use for polishing basics or launching a workout.

Chuck and company do a great job, and you should have this in your inventory if you are building a library of martial arts instruction.",1293408000,,980,5.144654088050315

It keeps me from getting ""too big for my britches""! I highly urge people to watch this DVD!",1176854400,,475,4.534883720930233
