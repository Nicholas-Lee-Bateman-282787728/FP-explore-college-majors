2217543,2,B0007LFQ6U,"Maybe someone would like this DVD if they are new to exercise or want a very basic and extremely low intensity workout. I bought it because it was cheaper than most other prego workout DVD's and need variety. Kira seems very nice, but doesn't seem to have a lot of teaching experience. It is easy to follow and safe, but can't see it getting a lot of use in my house.",1139270400,8,367,4.183098591549296
2217544,5,B0007LFQ6U,"I think these are a wonderful series of videos for everyone.  I used this one during my pregnancy and after and loved the results.  I started with light weights and then increased them as I became more comfortable.  I totallly disagree with the negative reviews.  This is a great video, and I totally recommend getting both!",1139011200,,324,4.732142857142857
2217545,5,B0007LFQ6U,"I am not sure what type of workout the two low reviewers were looking for, but I like this workout!

I never exercised regularly before becoming pregnant and was intimidated by other videos but this one gave me the confidence to keep doing it regularly. I get a good workout from it!

My doctor said my exercise should be comfortable and enjoyable and not to worry about making it intense or getting my heart rate too high and this workout fits the bill! I liked that the other women were ""real"", like me! The in shape and perfect people-I find unmotivating!

I also like the scenery-very pretty and relaxing outdoors.",1138406400,4,618,4.6
2217546,1,B0007LFQ6U,"This tape really didn't give me a workout at all.  The cardio portion, although it has simple steps, does nothing to get my heart rate going and that was with adding hand weights to it.  She gives a lot of suggestions as to how to ""tone it down"" and none for how to increase intensity.  I was honestly shocked at how short the abdominal portion was, but found those exercises at least a little outside of the ordinary ab routines.  And a small side note, she has two other women working out with her to demonstrate pre-pregnancy and post-pregnancy - both of whom are overweight, which I didn't find too motivating.  All in all I was really disappointed with this dvd and will definitely be sticking with my Perfect Preganancy Workout, which continues to be challenging each time I do it.  My suggestion is to not bother with this one, you'd get a better workout taking a brisk walk around the neighborhood.",1137888000,5,906,4.561728395061729
2217547,5,B0007LFQ6U,"I purchased, reviewed and used the cardio & core workout by Kira and found it to be an excellent video even though I was not pregnant. I use it when I can't make it to the gym for my regular workout. It is a slower pace than at the gym but you actually can use heavier weights than you would use at the gym because you have a little more time to do the exercise and focus on the muscles you are trying to work. I actually work out with Kira two to three times a week in her classes and find her to be an excellent trainer. I value her input and she has helped me to trim down and keep the weight off. I also have her video 10 minutes to tone which I have shared with my co-workers and can't get it back from them as they are excited about being able to either do a 10 minute workout or a 30 minute workout and feel as though they are actually working out and seeing results. Her videos are excellent.",1136937600,2,900,3.9234972677595628
2217548,1,B0007LFQ6U,"This is really quite a bad DVD.  I wouldn't say it's totally useless, but it is definitely on that side of the spectrum.  It is waaaay too basic -- this would only be a workout for you if you 1) never exercise, 2) are completely uncoordinated, and 3) are in the latter part of your third trimester.  She has both a pre-pregnancy and a post-pregnancy person doing the workout with her.  I cannot imagine this workout being sufficient exercise for either (though both are ""plus sized"" and don't appear to be major exercisers, so perhaps it is).

On the good side, she has some pelvic floor exercises, the steps are all really basic so that is nice if you are really uncoordinated, the non-pregnant women in the video are larger if you prefer that kind of thing.

On the bad side: 1) way too basic and not sufficiently challenging as a workout (basically like going for a stroll); 2) she doesn't go a good job of settting up changes in the moves, she basically tells you to change right sas she is changing herself (the women in the video couldn't even follow her); 3) boring, boring, boring -- very few moves and very little variety.  I can't imagine doing this tape frequently (honestly I will be surprised if I ever do it again).

Overall --- there are much much better videos out there.  My favorite right now if the ""Perfect Pregnancy Workout"".  It beats this one hands down.

Also, and this is a pet peeve of mine, I noticed (after I bought it unfortunately) that all of the rave reviews on this DVD come from people who have not reviewed anything on Amazon other than this DVD. Friends, family, imposters?  who knows... but I'm just guessing that they aren't ""real"" reviews...",1136764800,,1680,4.54485049833887
2217549,5,B0007LFQ6U,"I have done Kira's other videos (from her website for the Allinoneworkout videos) and I think she is a great instructor! I got my sister the Cardio & Core DVD when we found out she was pregnant. She says she enjoys the low-impact workout, easy to understand but not difficult to do.

I would recommend any workout Kira instructs as she is informative and motivating but not intimidating.",1134086400,,387,4.6911764705882355
2217550,5,B0007LFQ6U,Kira is both informative and motivational.  I would recommend this series to any one thinking about getting pregnant or needs an energy boost while pregnant. I  have four kids and have never felt better! I still enjoy the workout!,1125446400,8,230,4.871794871794871
2217551,5,B0007LFQ6U,The workout focuses on low impact cardio.  The moves are easy to follow. The Core section focuses on Kegels and ab exercises that can be done throughout pregnancy to aid delivery and recovery.,1124236800,9,192,4.818181818181818
8048122,1,B0007LFQ6U,"Not for somebody that wants a real, empowering and motivating workout... There's 3 fat ladies marching on grass, by a pond/river... Lisa Hart's or Summer Sanders's workouts for pregnancy are faaaar better if you want to feel that you are not wasting your time or money...",1306972800,,271,4.913043478260869
8048123,3,B0007LFQ6U,I really like Kira Langolf in this... but have to say that it was only good for my WORST pregnant days when I was so nauseous I couldn't do anything else. It was really too easy and very low intensity. This would be better than nothing though or a good place to start for someone that doesn't exercise.,1217980800,,302,4.224137931034483
8048124,1,B0007LFQ6U,"First of all, I'll say that although I worked out occasionally pre-pregnancy, I was by no means a marathon runner. I smoked, and when I did work out it wasn't high impact. Nevertheless, I wanted something that would get my heart pumping but not make me pass out. This DVD looked like a good pick, but BOY was I wrong. First of all, it looks like something that a couple of teenagers filmed for a high school health class project. Literally, it's filmed with a camcorder on a golf course. Who cares about film quality though--right? Well it only gets worse. This doesn't give you any workout whatsoever, I didn't give up until about 25 minutes when my heartrate wasn't elevated at all, wasn't sweating, basically it felt like I had done nothing. I get a better workout lifting chips from the bag to my mouth.

I reccomend Denise Austin's Fit and Firm Pregnancy. It's well worth the money, has trimester adjusted strength workouts and a great cardio workout as well as postnatal core workouts.",1214956800,,991,4.662857142857143
8048125,3,B0007LFQ6U,"This program is pretty lame, but I think some of the very negative reviews are a little unfair, as this is clearly for women who are either new to exercise or out of shape -and of course pregnant on top of that. It basically consists of very simple foot movements combined with simple arm waving. Nothing fancy and no props needed (except maybe a chair or something for balance on stretches). The women in the video have what I would call normal bodies- that is, they are not very thin, and the lead woman appears to be pregnant. I myself am overweight though not obese and I haven't got much exercise since the birth of my 1st child 18mos ago. I really only use this dvd when I feel too lazy to pay attention to the more complicated moves in other videos (or to gather up necessary pillows, towels, etc). The only thing that might be a problem for some uncoordinated people like me is the way they switch moves after only a few repetitions, but probably not an issue for most. So, bottom line, it is not going to be interesting or challenging for most people, but if it gets someone up and moving who otherwise would not be, then it's not all bad. Oh, and it's a lot cheaper than some others.",1212451200,,1193,4.330357142857143
8048126,3,B0007LFQ6U,"I understand that you need to ""take it easy"" exercising while you are pregnant. I wouldn't even consider this a workout. I never felt like I was receiving any benefit doing this tape. The instructor is bearable and not too obnoxious, but I just stuck to walking and swimming. The price is reasonable so it might be worth the money to some people, it just wasn't for me.",1189123200,,369,4.4411764705882355
8048127,5,B0007LFQ6U,"This DVD is aerobics, which I usually cant stand, but the instructor doesnt do a bad job. It gets you going and it great for days when you cant get it and walk. Nothing in it is terribly complicated and it has a somewhat relaxed pace. It sweeps you along and the tape is finished before you realize it. Great for the days you know you need to do something but don't feel like it.",1171497600,,379,4.066666666666666
8048128,5,B0007LFQ6U,"I got Kira's Total Body Tone dvd for the advanced pre-natal workout. The TBT workout is all weight training done in circuit format to get the heart rate up. If you like weight training and are pregnant Total Body Tone is the one for you!

I borrowed the Cardio & Core from a friend and thought it was a lite workout, good for the days when you just need to move a little but not overly strenous.

It is interesting to see the instructor pregnant and post-pregnancy. She looks incredible in TBT! She knows her stuff!",1148515200,,515,4.354166666666667
8048129,1,B0007LFQ6U,I wasn't an extremely active person before I got pregnant so I wanted some simple workouts to keep fit and healthy without overdoing it. This was hardly even a workout. It seemed to me that she liked to hear herself talk more than doing exercise. I'd recommend the Perfect Pregnancy Workout video and going on walks and swimming. This video was a waste of money and time.,1146528000,10,371,4.552238805970149
8048130,5,B0007LFQ6U,"I had been doing hard extensive exercises before pregnancy, but once I became pregnant toward 2nd trimester, I couldn't do any hard or regular exercise without my heart rate hitting 140 within 10 min.  And I was told by OB 140 beats is the highest recomnded.

  So being into exercise not wanting to give up I bought this video, and doing it I am gaining weight at a recomended rate and my beart rate is within good range.  First pregnancy I put on weight very quickly...About 89 pounds.

  I recomend this tape for anyone who may have extra weight on them before or people having trouble with heart rates or blood pressure.  Of course I am no doctor.  I have also expalined the video and she agrees it is fine for me.

Katrina",1144713600,2,727,4.390977443609023
8048131,5,B0007LFQ6U,"I used this workout while I was pregnant as well as after, and could not have made it through without it! I was too tired to go to the gym and needed something to help me not put on the 60 lbs. I put on with my first!  Kira saved my waist!  I did the workout 4-5 times a week and attribute my ability to get back into shape faster to her video.  Thanks!",1140480000,2,353,3.7432432432432434
