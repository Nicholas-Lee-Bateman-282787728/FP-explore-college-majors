8339695,5,B001SFEPJS,"For every woman you see shaking her ""booty"" in a music video promoting some rap or hi-hop star, there are hundreds (in come cases, 1,000) other dancers who tried out for that seven seconds of fame. This superb hour long documentary by Canadian Elizabeth St. Phillip, produced by the consistently award-winning National Film Board of Canada (70 Oscar Nominations!) follows three of these women through their journey to make it. (There is a fourth and her story, which was cut from the film, is provided as a ""special feature"" and is just as interesting.) There is Michelle, who has to choose between having a brief career as a video dancer or medical school, Linda, who lives in the ""projects"" of Toronto (where the documentary was filmed) and wants to go from dancer to rap star, and Tracy.

The short interviews with the Director as well as Hip-hop historian Nelson George add are like dessert after watching the film. We learn more reasons why theses thousands of women have their eye on becoming a star - if only for a brief moment.

This is one of the first of the National Film Board of Canada's productions to be released in the USA by BFS. This is great news as the NPB films - particularly the Academy Award Winning shorts - are rarely seen in the US. I look forward to many more.

Highly recommended.

its first of many attibutes is that its main subjects live in various areas of toronto, ontario.  why is this important?  because, even though it is not, say, tokyo, it still shows us the global impact of hip-hop dance on the world.

its second attribute is that it gets you thinking about who gets to dance in this world?  what weight does a dancer carry?  why does hip-hop dance still center on body type, gender, and even race? this question is a vital one to the discussion because no one can dispute the power of this dance form but we have to wonder if it's really unifying the world the way the music industry would have the consumer believe.

but even if you don't want to watch this very articulate documentary for these reasons, you can still enjoy its depiction of three women who bring something individual to the table and want to take away something individual in return.  their stories and experiences will entertain, shock, make you angry and hopefully even inspire you to be the best you can be against certain and definable odds.",1239840000,,1164,4.535885167464115
