7789518,5,0780018656,This rare Bergman is up there in my top ten. This has that same experimental fel as Face to Face and is very dark. I love the ending and feel it is bittersweet in that the main character gives up experiencing consciousness through a socioeconomic lens and appears to be happy in the psych ward just being. Just existing--Probably not the healthiest view of life but understandable. I feel convinced i am watching a man go insane in the sense of severing ties with social life. In the main characters experience if unfortunately involves murder but i understand what Bergman was trying to show here and it is an important film for the risky topic.,1475366400,,646,4.626086956521739
7789519,5,0780018656,"A complex dissection of a murder and a murderer, told by jumping back and forth
in time, before and after the event,  A deeply disturbing portrait of a man and a
society so cut off from feeling that violence seems almost inevitable.

 While more divided in public reaction then some of Bergman's most beloved films,
I think this edgy, bold, uncomfortable film ranks close to some of his best work.
While there are moments of pretension, there's also a lot of human and psychological
complexity (and wonderful acting) in this bleak exploration of how near murder and
madness lie to any of us.

Hard to believe this strong work by one if the greatest film-makers has never
been released on DVD in the US.",1337644800,3,702,4.637096774193548
7789520,5,0780018656,I am beginning to despair that this will never be released on DVD. I have to keep my stupid VCR just for this one movie!,1329696000,,120,3.84
7789521,5,0780018656,"With The sudden and sad departure of this emblematic filmmaker, vanishes at the same time the legitimate son of the existential anguish, Bergman may be regarded as the spiritual son of August Strindberg. As we know about, the genius is composed of so many lives, livings and influences that it results extremely difficult to label in a special category, but no other filmmaker walked over so many marshes of the human condition, where the ontological loneliness, submission, childhood traumas, and the entire exploration of so many inner demons into what we might design as collective unconscious were motive of febrile inspiration to convey us to the same entrails of desperation and agonic anxiety, nobody like him will be able to mirror with such prodigious realism the inextricable labyrinths of the human soul.

From life of the marionettes is indeed, one of his highest peaks in what concerns form and vital expression, a fascinating journey around the febrile anguish of a schizophrenic, featured with the deepest horridness. The claustrophobic environment, the handle of the camera - eye as incorporeal witness of his terrible condition makes of this film, unique in its own.",1185840000,4,1183,5.193717277486911
7789522,5,0780018656,"""From the life of Marionettes"" is a dark tale told by its multiple and unreliable characters. The plot begins with a shocking event through which the main character is introduced, where the audience is forced to judge him by the face value. What comes after is one of the most beautiful manifestations of Bergmanian prophecies: liberal, bitter, and extremely dark. This is a psychological hallucination, a bizzare experience in human relationship. Watch and levitate.",1046390400,,467,5.324324324324325
7789523,4,0780018656,"In addition to two fine reviews, let me add that the misogynist plot (Peter hates his wife Katrina but kills a prostitute instead) and the incessant recording (done by the investigator, the psychiatrist, and the murderer himself) draw our attention to the one gay man. Tim is a person who does not want to record what he has to say and who, although nearly everyone knows the imminent danger intuitively and disregards it, chooses to look himself in the mirror and recognizes the horror of both what he has done and not done. Yet we don't care when Katrina acknowledges his shallowness despite his hand upon her cheek. Since we don't care about Tim, how are we to care whether Peter ever found him? Consequently, Peter's anguish remains vague and we're left grateful he's locked up--not typical for Bergman who more often yearns for escape.",1040515200,,840,4.8
