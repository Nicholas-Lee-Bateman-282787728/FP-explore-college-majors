8461408,5,B0058DMFN4,I've never had the opportunity to visit New Orleans.  Loved this tour and the colorful city views and cultural music!  Felt like I was really cycling through the city and also liked cycling the Gulf Coast!  BOV does wonderfully realistic tours and I recommend them.  Workout time seems to go faster when viewing these videos versus looking at 4 walls!  Thanks BOV and Amazon!,1405900800,,375,4.796875
8461409,5,B0058DMFN4,"Absolutely love this DVD.  It makes my 30 or 45 minute workout great.  Even though it's 90 minutes in length, I can simply break it down to however long I wish; stop at that point, and pick up where I left off the next day of exercise.  My next orders though will definitley be the Blue-Ray sets.",1399248000,,296,4.157894736842105
8461410,5,B0058DMFN4,"The first part of the ride is right down the coast, with very realistic views of the ocean on one side, just the way you would see it if you were driving down the highway, and often a forest on the other. This is always exactly what I want when I'm doing virtual cycling of a place that I might like to visit or have visited and want to remember.

The beautiful white sands of the Gulf Islands National Seashore were fun to 'cycle' by. Toward the end, we visit Mobile Bay in Alabama. Then we covered all over the French Quarter in New Orleans, with music to match! Then there is what they called a ""Parade of Plantation Homes"", and we end up our tour inside one of them. What a treat! If you have a special place in the French Quarter, you'll probably catch at least a glimpse of it in this DVD. I found my favorites.

Bike-O-Vision cycling tours are always excellent. This one is no exception! Keep going with your workout so you don't miss the last part. It's worth seeing!",1332028800,2,975,4.264864864864865
