8001551,5,B0000E0ZYG,"Jim Weider is the real deal.  He's not only a true master of his craft, he loves what he does and appreciates those who went before him.  This video provides much more than guitar instruction, which BTW you don't already need to be a seasoned player to understand.  Jim Weider takes the time to reduce the instruction down to explicit hand and finger positioning that beginners can grasp.

He also goes into the gear.  He uses a variety of guitars and amps, explaining how to set them up to achieve specific sounds for historic accuracy in performances.",1363651200,3,553,4.65979381443299
8001552,2,B0000E0ZYG,"This DVD features legendary Fender guitars and amplifiers. I was hoping to hear how these wonderful instruments sound from a good guitar player. Well Jim does play great guitar. The instruments, amps are fantastic. So what is the problem? The tone he gets from these wonderful instruments are horrific. He even manages to murder the tone of Fender Jazzmaster when he attempts to play surf music. I never thought a Jazzmaster can sound so bad... thanks Jim. He does show a few tricks of legendary guitar players like James Burton, Roy Buchanan. But the tone he gets is so horrible that they all sound alike, like a broken children's guitar.",1322524800,,639,4.818181818181818
8001553,5,B0000E0ZYG,"Jim is very entertaining as he shares his knowledge of electric guitar history and lore.  Then he shows the styles of some great players from Roy Buchanan to SRV and Hendrix, playing with flair and feeling.  Jim plays real good, and this DVD left me wanting more.",1275177600,3,263,4.574468085106383
