8747493,5,B01AIUWTAU,The film is GREAT and both the architecture and the idea are amazing! If only the least expensive room was not $1700. a night ...! The folks of Newfoundland can't even stay there... Not that I don't want to go! But I will have to stay elsewhere... to bad... because it's SO BEAUTIFUL! If you like architecture and empty spaces... or big ideas this film is for you! I have already started planning my trip!,1481328000,2,405,4.413333333333333
8747494,5,B01AIUWTAU,I visited Fogo Island recently and someone there recommended this documentary to me.  I loved it! I visited many of the places that were featured and it was wonderful to get more history of the place as well as watch Zita Cobb's vision and execution of her dream.,1465948800,,263,4.479166666666667
8747495,5,B01AIUWTAU,"Amazing film telling the story of an amazing place, Fogo Island, and the wonders that architect Todd Saunders has built there including the one-of-a-kind hotel, the Fogo Island Inn, inspired by Fogo Island native, Zita Cobb.  A trip to Fogo Island should be on everyone's must-experience-in-a-lifetime list (I've been three times)  but if you can't get there, this film will transport you to one of the world's most magical spots!",1463875200,,430,5.128571428571429
