7725494,1,B01DWYQV26,"I would have to disagree with the other reviewers here, this was not a good season, it could have been if they had gotten rid of Tony. I just couldn't stand to hear him speak and that is all he did was talk and talk and talk. I don't know what it is, the accent, the cliches, or the run on 90 mph sentences but it drove me crazy and was like listening to fingernails on a blackboard.",1503964800,3,383,3.923076923076923

7725497,5,B01DWYQV26,"I was on this season so I can attest to the fact that it is one of the few seasons worth owning...That's me in the upper right corner. Yeah, the hot chick in the tankini. Seriously - a great cast of characters, blindsides galore, and a fun ride for all. Gotta love new player seasons. Hope you enjoy it! #ChaosKass",1469404800,65,314,4.25
7725498,5,B01DWYQV26,"I am a die-hard Survivor fan and have seen every season at least twice, and I will tell you that Cagayan is my #3 favorite season. Entertaining from start to finish, a lot of amazing characters and a great and deserving winner. Glad it's finally coming to DVD.",1460246400,5,260,4.4375

7725500,3,B01DWYQV26,"One of the greatest seasons of all time. Pretty good cover. Once again, I advise to change the cover up while you still can. If you check twitter, you will notice the #Trishwasrobbed hashtag. I would advise putting trish on the cover over sarah. Fans want her on it and making them happy = extra cash. Only complaint",1460160000,,316,4.4655172413793105

8757066,5,B01DWYQV26,"I'm a huge Survivor dork and as far as the season goes, Cagayan is in my top five. It's got something for everyone- it's one of the rare seasons with great strategic play and a handful of over-the-top memorable characters (including Kass, who is easily one of my favorite players ever). However, the main reason I'm writing this review is because I decided to buy this season on Blu Ray, instead of DVD. I hadn't bothered to upgrade to Blu Ray on previous seasons because I didn't think it would make that much of a difference- I was wrong. The difference is incredible. Amazon has done a fantastic job with Survivor in Hi-Def. The picture is razor-sharp, with each little detail being crystal clear.

I really like the Blu Ray version being on fewer discs, even though it would be even better if Amazon would include a ""play all"" feature. However, if you're on the fence about whether to go with DVD or Blu Ray- I highly recommend spending the few extra dollars on Blu Ray- the improvement in picture quality is astounding.",1515283200,,1024,4.595628415300546
8757067,5,B01DWYQV26,"All you can ask for of modern Survivor - fun and fleshed-out characters, strong story build, impactful game philosophy and a FINAL 2. (sorry, spoilers). The Blu-ray is slightly better than the DVD, but not ground shattering. Still, the greatest season of modern Survivor getting a home video release will always get a 5 star. #teamTV",1513987200,,333,4.964285714285714
8757068,5,B01DWYQV26,I loved this season I loved Morgan M. she hot hot hot ! also liked Kass M. she should have won the million she played the best game!,1512259200,,132,3.75
