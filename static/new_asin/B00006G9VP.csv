7968605,4,B00006G9VP,"I had no idea what this show would be when I ordered it.  I knew it had David Jason, of whom I am a fan, and I had heard a little bit about Ronnie Barker but had never seen his work.  Aside from being very dated, I though the writing was very clever and funny.  I ordered Season One and Season Two at the same time, and was glad I did.  I have watched them repeatedly usually while I am doing something else in the same room. I just love hearing the jokes in the background, while I am doing something else.  Very well done.",1302307200,2,524,3.9523809523809526
7968606,5,B00006G9VP,"Open All Hours is classic BBC at it's best. While the series may not carry the broad mainstream appeal [to American audiences]; as say, Monty Python, or Benny Hill; the series features Ronnie Barker; a major UK Legend; and one half of ""the two ronnies"". (The OTHER Ronnie of course being Ronnie Corbett; from the show ""Sorry"".)
Open All Hours is wonderful, and it reminds us of a simplier time that predates it's early 70's release. Included on this disc is the original pilot episode which aired three years before the series!
One last thing: you might note that the picture Amazon shows above is for Season TWO; but I ordered it, and received Season One as I hoped.
I highly recommend this hilarious show!",1210636800,3,707,4.664
