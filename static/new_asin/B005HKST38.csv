 The Jade Raksha centers on the title character's desire for revenge for the death of her family at the hands of a member of the Yan clan. As she's not sure which one she just works her way through them. As she comes close to her goal she encounters Hero Xu (Tang Ching), who has just learned a hard lesson about seeking revenge. Hero Xu is caught between the Jade Raksha and his obligation to her target. Mainly the film is a warning against the cycles of revenge that form the plot for so many of these films.
 There are strong performances by classic Shaw Brother's character actors Ku Feng (my all time favorite), Fan Mei Shing and Yeung Chi-HIng. The action is well done for time.",1487894400,,1033,5.142857142857143
