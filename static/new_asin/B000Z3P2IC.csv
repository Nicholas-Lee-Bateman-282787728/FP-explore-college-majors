8234689,5,B000Z3P2IC,I use this with my clients and it hits home every time. They can see themselves in the video and it is a great learning/teaching moment.,1386979200,,136,4.269230769230769
8234690,2,B000Z3P2IC,"This video is concise and short (10 minutes) and has real people in real situations.  However, I would not use it in a parenting class.  So many of the ""solutions"" given were in the category of let kids get away with negative behaviors.  Now, to be fair, they did suggest saying ""no"" to the big things, but did not have suggestions to how to get through everyday issues other than just letting them go.",1338768000,,402,4.405405405405405
8234691,4,B000Z3P2IC,The video is short but I am a visual learner. I use this video to teach my parents in counseling. I teach them to be aware of the way they talk to their kids. Yelling only teaches kids to yell back.,1316131200,5,198,3.8536585365853657
