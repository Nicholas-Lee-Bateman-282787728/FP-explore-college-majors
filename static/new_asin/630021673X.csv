272625,4,630021673X,"I loved the movie ... Richler successfully adapted his book by the same name to the big screen.  Unfortunately, the DVD version is about 15 minutes shorter than the VHS version and, in many places, the color is washed out.  The movie is great so get the VHS version, sit back and enjoy the story and see what life was like in the late 1940's in Montreal.",1066435200,13,354,4.268656716417911
272626,5,630021673X,"...and pulls him out from under us.

The  back of the ""Duddy Kravitz"" VHS box alleges that Duddy ""uses the girl who loves him, forges checks, and lies but somehow still manages to work his way into our hearts.""  To describe the film this way misses its uniqueness by inverting its point.  Richard Dreyfuss' charismatic,  touching, and wildly comic performance  (the key performance of his career, and little-seen),  effortlessly and immediately batters its way into our hearts.  The process by which Duddy squanders those affections and the affections of those around him (perhaps most tragically Yvette's and Virgil's)  is incremental, painful, and, we have no reason to suppose otherwise, irreversible.  Only gradually does it become clear that he draws no distinction between people and objects - both are merely means to an end.  The VHS blurb suggests a redemption, a feel-good experience  that's nowhere to be found in this film.  Duddy not only betrays other characters; he betrays the audience,  truly and distressingly.  Despite his energy and intelligence and charm, this punk manages to work his way out of our hearts.

At what point does the viewer cut him dead?  Or does Duddy continue (see review below) to seem ""inspiring""?  The film doesn't insist, to its credit, on any one answer to those questions.  Along with the enormous amount of physical energy at his disposal,  Duddy possesses a prodigious, caustic wit which he frequently unloads on those who would directly challenge him.  The brilliance of the film is that these harangues are so sympathetically written and masterfully performed that viewers may not know what to make of them, other than to mistake them for ringing endorsements of Duddy's behavior.",1065657600,20,1729,5.125448028673835

272628,5,630021673X,"I agree with the first reviewer - This is an excellent movie.  Duddy Kravitz (played by Richard Dreyfuss) fits the bill as a typical entrepreneur.  Set in Montreal in 1948, Duddy Kravitz knows that he is going to be successful, just not at what.  However, a chance opportunity during a picnic with his girlfriend Yvette (played by the beautiful Micheline Lanctot) gave him is dream and set in motion a series of events and necessities that allowed him to achieve his dream, but with some costs.  This is a must see movie for (1) the budding entrepreneur, (2) the entrepreneur currently suffering some setbacks and in need of some inspiration, and (3) those who want to see a slice of life from Montreal back in the late 1940's (it was, still is and will always be, a great city to live in).",1017532800,4,790,4.542253521126761

272668,3,630021673X,"This is the movie that helped launch Dreyfuss. 1974. His character is thin, pale, brash, obnoxious,and thoroughly unlikeable.
Film was well received in Canada and the States. Dreyfuss went to the premierethought he'd never work again, and promptly took back his refusal to work with Spielberg on ""Jaws"". ""Jaws came out 1 year later and Dreyfuss looked like a totally different person. Tanned, more muscular and sporting a full beardhe looked ten years older. And he had developed that cocky smart aleck intellectual persona that would become his trademark. ""Jaws"" and Dreyfuss were hits.",1408579200,,587,5.25531914893617
272699,1,630021673X,Why Alliance video would put this movie out in full-frame pan and scan versus widescreen in its original aspect ratio of 2.35 : 1. It makes no sense -- in the main the film will only appeal to film buffs and Richard Dreyfuss fans; both of whom would appreciate the full theatrical version in its original aspect ratio.,1389830400,5,318,4.5
272700,5,630021673X,"This movie launched Richard Dreyfuss's career.  This is a coming-of-age movie that's a bit different.  Duddy wants respect from his father and to be a big man in his community.  His ambitions lead him to love and friendship that he eventually betrays. Despite the heartbreak and rejection he experiences, he ultimately succeeds in his quest for significance.  The director wisely leaves the final judgment about Duddy to the viewers.",1389312000,,433,5.231884057971015
272701,3,630021673X,"I remember it being so much better when I originally saw the film.  Perhaps it was
the cutting that diminished it for me.  Still, a brilliant performance by Dreyfuss and
penetrating, believable story about being controlled by ambition and  losing of one's humanity
in the process.",1388448000,,280,5.043478260869565
272702,4,630021673X,Coming of age tale starring Richard Dreyfuss set in Montreal. Reminds me of a John Irving story. Sad and funny at the same time.,1388448000,,128,4.375
272703,5,630021673X,"The APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ seemed so powerful to me. It  left me at that time with intangible  questions. The first question this film tried to  answer for me is ""What does a man/person have to do to gain the respect of his  family and the people in his life"".It seemed like an important question to me . In fact the answer to this question isThis movie shows  WHAT NOT to do to gain their respect. The second question I pondered and still do is "" when to stop pushing for growth and let it happen naturally"".Better put by the song "" There is a time ....... to let things happen"" Yes I am a child of the seventies.
 Duddy lives in a jewish community in Montreal circa 1950. He is a recent high school graduate from a working class ,motherless family. The only member who actual has a place in their heart for Duddy is his zeda (grandgather in yiddish). He.listens to his zeda as if his words are gems and the path to respectability. ""A man must have his own land .This is self respect. As there is no one else to guide him or for that matter care for and about him. So begins our ride to Duddys respectability..
The film takes us on the quest to own land and therefore respectability. On this quest we are introduced to some real characters. Jack Warden ,Duddys dad , as always a pleasure to watch him at his craft. Another cast member is the super baritone Joe Silver ,a great charactet actor you need to see before you say I know him.
Duddy develops several friendships but doesnt know what frienship means. Here is where you can ask yourself ""what is a friend and how far out does a person have to go to show it "".Ee are given lots of laughs on the way .The best is british great Denholm Elliot as a movie producer and flm maker of Bar Mitzvot and Jewish weddings. Really funny. The pathos is between his friends and family. At the end we are still left with the feeling whether or not Duddy has achieved his goal by his standards.
This movie is Richards  Dreyfus first film with the leading  role on film . For you trivia buffs he is in The Graduate with a line.
 Over the years Richard Dreyfus has given us a great body of work and ,in film, it starts here.
Another film about respectability and self worth is Lies my Father Told Me.",1371081600,2,2247,4.268235294117647

272707,5,630021673X,"Mordecai Richler's great novel about Duddy Kravitz and his drive to fulfill his grandfather's ""mantra-a man without land is nothing""-is brilliantly brought to life by Richard Dreyfuss- at his best- as Duddy. The supporting cast is brilliant as well(I think Joe Silver steals the film with his portrayal of the scrapman Mr. Farber).My only regret is that Richler didn't write a sequel;he would later write 'Oh Canada,Oh Quebec',which I think is still the premier book about Quebec vs. the rest of Canada. I would've  liked to see whether Duddy patched things up with Virgil the epileptic,played by Randy Quaid and Yvette,played beautifully by Micheline Langtot-and how things progressed in 'Kravitzville',which Duddy planned to name his resort-which he acquired by hook-and crook-and whether he made up with his 'Zaydeh' played by Zvi Schooler. In any case,this is one terrific-and honest-film.",1151452800,6,893,5.424460431654676
272708,5,630021673X,"A very engaging movie about a young Jewish man (played by Richard Dreyfuss) who will do anything to make a buck, which is the only way he thinks he can be somebody. Dreyfuss, who is constantly on the verge of jumping out of his skin, is both funny and sad - and vulnerable. The movie has been accused of being anti-Semitic by some, but it's Duddy's single-minded brashness that is the focus here, not his religion. Drefuss is a joy to watch.",1127001600,10,441,4.390243902439025

7807100,3,630021673X,"Duddy Kravitz is one of the most despicable antiheroes in moviedom. Richard Dreyfus' portrayal of him makes Duddy particularly odious. I remember Dreyfus' irritating laugh from other films. Here, the director gave him free reign to indulge in a great many variations of it, each more fake-sounding and annoying than the previous one. As a consequence, there is something not quite believable in Dreyfus' performance. Not even someone with ADHD could sustain that level of hyperactivity. The storyline is compelling, the characters are well defined, but the overall atmosphere in this movie has something artificial about it.",1471651200,,624,5.443298969072165
