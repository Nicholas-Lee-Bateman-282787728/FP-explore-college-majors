2098443,5,B000219OZ4,This is an excellent tool for learning how to scratch. Qbert takes you through 30 chapters of different scratch techniques and teaches by matching his combo. He'll play and then you'll play and the lesson loops until you are ready to move along.,1139529600,9,245,4.72093023255814
2098444,5,B000219OZ4,"This dvd is amazing -- I've been in percussion for about 8 years and recently turned to learning how to scratch. Q-Bert displays how to do each scratch in a very clear manner and goes from simple rhythms to more complex adding things from each previous lesson. This was definitely made for people like me who don't know any scratch djs around and want to get into the art. Don't expect to get these down over night.. Like Q-Bert, you're going to be practicing for a long long time to get some of these things down.",1130284800,7,514,4.364583333333333
2098445,5,B000219OZ4,"This DVD gives a very good introduction to all the basic scratching techniques.  The multiple camera angles and soundtrack options are brilliant - in fact it's the first time I've seen these DVD features used in a useful way.

Qbert's personality makes this fun to work with.  He doesn't try to drop jargon or come off as some kind of hipster.  No bragging about being one of the world's best DJs (although he is.)  His style is very casual and conversational - it feels like you're hanging out with him at his house on a saturday afternoon.

Note that Qbert scratches in a  ""hamster"" style (with the crossfader flipped from right to left) - This might not be your style.  And if you don't have a hamster switch (Normal/Reverse) on your mixer you won't be able to copy his moves.  Personally I don't use the hamster style but I was still able to learn a lot from the disc.

Highly recommended.",1127779200,22,893,4.490683229813665
2098446,4,B000219OZ4,"Love it. I like how they loop the lessons over and over, but they should have looped the same one a few times before they moved on to the others.  I have to keep rewinding. And there are no different angles like they say there are. But overall still a happy purchase.",1127606400,7,267,4.134615384615385
2098447,4,B000219OZ4,What do you know about being underground? Get this if you really suck at djing.,1085529600,2,79,4.333333333333333
2098448,5,B000219OZ4,"Yo, if you are new to scratching or you wanna learn some new tricks from the master DJ Qbert buy this DVD.  Q breaks down over 20 scratches (looping) at 4 different angles the camera work is amazing the best I've ever seen from any DJ video/DVD.  This DVD is loaded with features and very helpful DJ tips from set-up and weights/balance, slip mats, tuner control spray, how to fix a leak, and a whole lot more.  Q then has 4 different characters (Punt Rawk, etc.) you can battle against yo his outifts are crazy funny.  Also this DVD has a few easter eggs with a few more characters.  Buy this DVD it's worth every penny and yo I just got Do-it Yourself Vol. II @ the Scratch Tour 2003 and it's just as good as the first one so when you get a chance pick up Vol. II both showcase one of the Greatest SQratch DJ's of all-time.....

8027985,4,B000219OZ4,LOL Q-Bert was just a litty baby peanut when he made this dvd.  But it's a good tutorial... I didn't get anywhere near the level where I had to worry about him using the hamster switch,1466985600,,184,4.111111111111111
8027986,5,B000219OZ4,"I bought this DVD in the early 2000s and can say it is single handedly the most helpful resource for any aspiring scratch/turntablist DJ. If you are at all interested in learning the art of turntablism (as it was up until that point) pick up this DVD.

He demonstrates every scratch and then breaks it down at a slow tempo so you can figure out what's going on. The DVD is setup to loop the instructional bit automatically so you can keep the flow going. I believe there are alternate camera angles available as well.

There is also a set of hilarious bonus features where Q scratches 2 or 4 bars in various costumes and then gives you the same amount of time so you can ""battle"" him.  Nice extra touch to an otherwise awesome DVD.

Q is the master at what he does, is super friendly, and keeps it easy to understand.

Great performer, great teacher",1433894400,,849,4.382165605095541

8027989,1,B000219OZ4,This is an old ass video. Super lame by today's standards. I ended up joining Q-Bert's Skratch University. It's super current and blows this video away.,1390348800,,152,4.884615384615385
8027990,5,B000219OZ4,"Qbert is such a scratch stud.  He's very good at explaining, obviously highly skilled, the lessons build on each other and repeat for you to practice.  Additionally, there are some repeating battles at the end for a few different skill levels.",1360022400,,243,4.902439024390244
8027991,5,B000219OZ4,"I liked this video because it shows you how to do a variety of scratches, step by step.  It's very hard to imitate what Q can do, but practice makes perfect, right?  He also loops the scratches so they play over and over, good way to practice.",1293408000,,243,4.148936170212766
8027992,4,B000219OZ4,This is a great tool for beginners to learn how to scratch. The DVD allows you to loop the scratch videos infinitely until you get it right. This is highly recommended for anyone looking to learn basic scratch techniques.,1265414400,,221,4.6923076923076925
