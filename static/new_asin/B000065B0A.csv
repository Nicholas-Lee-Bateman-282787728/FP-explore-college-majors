8324734,5,B000065B0A,"This is the continuation of a wonderful story which makes the wait for the next 2 volumes unbearable. Like Vol 1, the English-dubbed version of the story is superb. The voice-actors are excellent, and in fact the actress who portrays one of the main characters also sings the title song, which is haunting in its beauty.
The story is familiar - 2 Japanese schoolgirls transported to an alternate world who must embark on a quest to save the world and themselves - but the characters and animation are unique and original.
I love this series! When will we get the rest?",1042848000,,568,4.633663366336633
