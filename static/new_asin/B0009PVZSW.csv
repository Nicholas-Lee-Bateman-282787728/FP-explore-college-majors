OK - this may just be the single worst straight-to-video ""horror"" movie ever released. Where to start? The mind reels!! Well, it could be the CGI, which must have been coded by a five year old. Or, it could be the acting - it seems like the actors were playing roles that had nothing to do with the fact that they were all staring death in the face. Or, it could be the action sequences - the one where the tactical military commander shoots his buddy eight times because he thinks it's funny that the buddy can't get the ant off his back. Hmm... where else? Suffice it to say, you will know within the first two minutes when the overweight actor in the plant nursery starts wandering around his shop looking for the missing employees. It makes me wonder if the director and producer got together over a few beers and decided to take a trip down to the local community center acting class and just close their eyes and pick a cast at random, just for kicks.

You would be better off getting a hammer and hitting yourself in the head with it for 90 minutes.",1126051200,,1090,4.338235294117647
2311070,1,B0009PVZSW,"When I think back to all those Sci-fi movies dealing with radioactive insects I think of THEM,EMPIRE OF THE ANTS,TRANTULA,and of course the DEADLY MANTIS.These movies were unreal but not with the thought of possibilities. This thing has the worst story line,hammyest acting and the most poorly computerized ants that I've ever seen. A group of people are trapped inside a tall skyscraper{LOOKS LIKE THE MODEL FROM TOWERING INFERNO}on a Saturday buy a bunch of oversized ants that came in via plants that were delivered. The main star is C. THOMAS HOWELL a janitor who got the job as a probation from jail for hot wiring cars. The worst actor in todays market has to go to MARTIN KOVE {KARATE KID} as a special agent to exterminate the ants. I'm not going to ramble on but its junk like this that makes me wonder; If you're going to make junk woundn't you at least spend the money to create realalistic creatures or at least put some good people in there? Oh and one more thing, since when do people from the agricultural society know anything about ants?! They don't carry guns either. Do your self a favor folks save your money,if you want a laugh rent Empire of the ants if you want to be frusterated then by all means go for it. YOU'LL See how stupid this thing really is and boring. I gave it 1 star only because of C.Thomas Howell,he didn't speak much but when he does its sincere,not like those others who wouldn't shut up. Who still uses sugar cubes? didn't that go out of style in the fifties.  NICE 50'S TOUCH FRED OLSEN RAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1123027200,2,1557,4.560714285714286

8064980,3,B0009PVZSW,"This one was kind of slow. The characters were a little ""goofy"" to me. The ants were not that realistic but the movie is old so I guess that's to be expected. I usually watch my movies again within a few months, this I will probably wait until next year.",1404432000,,254,4.1
8064981,2,B0009PVZSW,"Ants living in some plants delivered to an office building start growing and attacking the people in the building. Luckily it's a Saturday so not many people are in the building (budget reasons?) We've got newspaper editor Stella Stevens and her suffering assistant Siri Baruc, and a few others.

This low budget film has a couple of scenes that are really bad but overlall, it's your average low budget giant insect movie. The story is standard stuff, not very inspired. Not a very good movie but not all bad. It's watchable but not really as entertaining as some other movies of its types and not worth spending too much money on.",1322697600,,632,4.693693693693693
8064982,3,B0009PVZSW,"Alright...

Glass Trap is not a *total* disaster.  Just the fact that the focus is on the cheesiness of these giant attacking black ants walking around through a building (with low budget acting skills by the main characters; of which there were definitely an unnecesary AMOUNT of characters to begin with) should be enough to keep your undivided attention for the entire 1 hour and 25 minutes the movie is running.

These ants are on a mission to kill everyone who's trapped inside the building.  This would include the SUPER HOT character played by Siri Baruc, a teenage girl who's in love with her new present (a radio) and an easily-annoyed bossy old lady who has ZERO tolerance for anybody it would seem.  Oh, and the janitor of course.

So the question is- WILL all these people eventually find a way to escape?  There's seriously like over 10 main characters, and to give the film writers a bit of credit, the storyline with each of these characters is actually fairly involving and detailed with their own dilemmas taking place with different scenes constantly jumping around.

The ants themselves though... wow, haha.  They don't even really act like normal ants either.  They're just really eager to bite someones face off until guts are shown flying against the walls and floors.  It's a bit grotesque to say the least.

Actually everything about the film is grotesque, but admit it- you wanted to stick around until the conclusion to find out who'd survive and who'd become ant droppings!",1291420800,,1500,4.8392156862745095
8064983,2,B0009PVZSW,"Pretty good production values for a low budget film.  The acting is hit and miss, again this is a low budget film so don't expect miracles.  I was hoping for more tense sequences with the giant ants, but odd camera angles made most of the fight sequences kind of boring.  This movie is on par with made for TV movies on SCI-FI and other networks.",1281657600,,346,4.292307692307692
8064984,3,B0009PVZSW,"Sure they're plenty of better suspense movies than this one, but I don't believe that the reviews are really fair about this movie.  Its a low budget movie, that can be easily seen from the rather poor special effects when it comes to showing the gigantic ants.  Those types of computer animations are simply 3rd rate, but besides that the movie does develop some kind of suspense.  And C. Thoams Howell is pretty good as the reluctant janitor in this film who along with 2 other people have to find a way out of this ant infested office building, since those ants can kill humans.  Its not bad, and if one dosen't have anything else to do its worth seeing it for some 90 minutes.",1235520000,,680,4.416
8064985,2,B0009PVZSW,"Firstly, this movie does some things well. The introductions of most of the cast were reasonably good and the general plot began to develop quickly. As for the comic relief parts, some of the one-liners in this movies are better than the one-liners I've heard in most movies.

The main problem this movie has is, once the main premise, ants attacking humans in an office building, is underway... the threat level never increases. As you'd expect, the body count rises, but in this movie, that is usually the result of the victim's actions.

I think the writers should have spent more time trying to decide what actually happens when ants start attacking people. Aside from that, the only problem is that a central character debuts far too close to the end of the movie.

It does have its good points, but ultimately, the main elements of the plot could have been handled better.",1202169600,,878,4.7254901960784315
8064986,1,B0009PVZSW,"I had to write a review so that I could save someone else the energy from thinking this might be even a wee bit entertaining.  The effects were so far subpar that you could not fool a 5 year old into believing in the large ants.  This movie has been done repeatedly in different ways (the giant killer insects) and better.  In the 50's at least there was an excuse for the cheesy effects.  This is the 2nd adult C Thomas Howell movie I purchased in which I realized that this poor guy needs to go into real estate or something.  The Crimson Code is also very poor.

Not only is the acting questionable and not entertaining (except for Stella Stevens, she did great!) but the costume designer needs to be punished.  C Thomas was dressed like a french painter slash janitor with the ascot and all.  PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE!

I would have rated this movie lower then 1 if it had been offered.  If it comes free on Sci-Fi and it's a Sunday and you are bored, give it a shot.  If it's for actively purchasing this thing and paying shipping.... well, I wouldn't do it.",1161216000,5,1059,4.37948717948718
8064987,3,B0009PVZSW,"Remember THEM....THE BLACK SCORPION...BEGINNING OF THE END..TARANTULA?  Those magnificently corny but loveable big bug movies of the fifties?  Well, THE GLASS TRAP whether intentionally or unintentionally pays homage to these movies in its own delightful way.  The ants don't look too bad from a distance, but the close ups are cheesy and pedophilic!  But that's what makes this movie so tolerably enjoyable.  C. Thomas Howell looks completely lost in his heroic janitor(?) role; Stella Stevens (always Linda Rogo from THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE) chews up the scenery a'la Joan Crawford and Bette Davis; B movie stalwarts Brent Huff, Andrew Prine, Ron Harper and Chick Vennera add cult status; and Martin Kove is hilarious as the ""specialist"" who comes in to save the day.  The movie is rightfully ridiculous but if you loved those killer bug movies aforementioned (as I did growing up on them), then THE GLASS TRAP can be forgiven for its clunky amateurishness.",1126051200,4,958,5.188311688311688
