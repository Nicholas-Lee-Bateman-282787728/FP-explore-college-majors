8620881,4,B0000E6FQ0,"I've been looking for these movies for awhile in the stores and decided on ordering online.  The movies brought back memories of watching them as a kid but I was kind of disappointed by the quality of the Three Amigos DVD.  It was ""jumpy"" in scenes and the overall quality was VHSish.  Would like to see a remastered version of it.  But overall, extremely happy.",1231286400,,362,4.523076923076923
8620882,4,B0000E6FQ0,"Three Amigos is slap-stick comedy all the way, I was holding my side the whole time. Capable of entertaning the kids while showing a plot for the parent. In short this film is funny.",1079308800,,182,4.382352941176471
