8529742,3,B008QOH15O,This was not as good as I thought it would be. It was entertaining but its not one that I would want to watch over and over again. More like a one in while movie.,1446076800,,162,3.657142857142857
8529743,3,B008QOH15O,"When you're tired of the usual formula, here's a nice combo. Little if any CGI, some twists, some turns and not the usual Hollywood stuff which in this instance is a relief. Actual swearing like adults do and everything! I liked it.",1424649600,,232,4.5476190476190474
8529744,4,B008QOH15O,"I am really enjoying this movie, but it was not subtitled in English so I had to use the Closed Caption provided by Amazon. Only problem with that was a significant portion of dialogue was missing. Sentences were never finished, sometimes nothing popped up in relation to what a character was saying. I'm understanding most of what's going on I guess, but I know I'm missing very important things. If Amazon could have this title properly subtitled, I'm sure many more people will watch it. Otherwise, excellent action, some drama, and some great funny moments.",1377993600,,561,4.91578947368421
8529745,5,B008QOH15O,"Kyung-gu Sul  just has a style you have to love it.  The move is one of those you don't want to miss a scene, or you will an important piece of the puzzle to the story.  This is very exciting and not predictable.  I would recommend this movie, it is a great addition to the Public Enemy movies released prior.",1362355200,2,309,4.1
8529746,4,B008QOH15O,"Haven't seen the film, but wasn't sure where else to put this - am trying to find out more on this film, so came to Amazon as I usually do ... and was surprised to see the wrong film description/""editorial review"" given for this film!  The description given is for the film 'Midnight F.M."", another South Korean thriller; is anyone reads this,  any idea how to get Amazon to get it right??",1355011200,4,389,4.388888888888889
