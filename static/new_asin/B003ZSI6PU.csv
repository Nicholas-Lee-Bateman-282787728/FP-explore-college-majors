8410789,4,B003ZSI6PU,"I had seen the film Night Train To Terror, when I was just a kid. It was one of my dad's cheesy picks from our local video store back in the 80's. That film got me away from G.I. Joe and Voltron for 90 minutes, though. I had always gravitated to stories about God and The Devil. My favorite episode of the Real Ghostbusters was the episode where Winston has to face off against the Devil in a gameshow that takes place in Hell. So upon seeing God and The Devil sitting opposite each other with a small table of light between them (I swear I remember it being a chess board), on a train bound for disaster, dealing over a handful of souls . . . I was HOOKED. The one story that intrigued me the most was the Case Of Claire Hanson. It was a heavily re-edited and in some parts, heavily re-dubbed version of Catalyst, aka The Nightmare Never Ends. Before I knew Richard Moll as Bull in the tv show Nightcourt, I had only seen him in this movie and The Sword And The Sorcerer as the demonic warlock, Xusia. I also swear that as a kid, I remember his part as Claire's husband James, being portrayed by Christopher Plummer. Guess it was the bad hair that Moll was sporting in the film. Watching this third segment of Night Train To Terror, I was fascinated with the character Mr. Olivier. The scene where he pulls off his dress sock to reveal a cloven hoof instead of a human foot, mesmerized me. The insidious expression on his face as he fumbled with his boot . . . the tilt of his head in a devilish manner before pulling off the sock . . . TRIPPED me OUT. This guy LOOKED EVIL. And the scene at the end when Claire attempts to surgically remove his heart, was CRAZY.

Years later in my late thirties, I couldn't get the movie out of my mind, and I managed to track down a dvd copy of Death Wish Club (the second story part of Night Train) here on Amazon, which is a trip all its own. That dvd and an obscure review of Death Wish Club led me to find out the title to that crazy TRAIN movie, and subsequently found a dvd copy of Night Train To Terror here on Amazon, also.

So finally, I recently decided to grab a copy of the Limited Edition of The Nightmare Never Ends, and was disappointed in the quality. Firstly, it says that there are ""Tromatic Extras"" included, but it's just some hilariously cheap and crazy trailers, and girls with sensor bars and stickers over their breasts while they dance to stupid music. I paid the $9.99 price tag for the movie, ANYWAYS. What has DISAPPOINTED me is simply that the picture quality looks like it was transfered from a badly used vhs. There's no clarity of the image that exists in the hacked up version on the Night Train dvd.

 I still enjoyed seeing the movie in it's entirety, finally. But I really do wish that the same transfer will one day be applied to this 90 minute cut on a blu ray, that was given to Night Train To Terror. The film is cheesy and obscure, but it's part of the same underground movie culture as The Toxic Avenger, and Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes. Any fan of low budget 80's horror  movies would get a kick out of it.",1506556800,,3088,4.235993208828523
8410790,4,B003ZSI6PU,"And this was a Troma movie?  I still liked the ever rearranging gray hair for the husband.
They must have been having a serious psychotropic situation to make a movie like this.  Or, a lack thereof?
Though, they still have the same animated lead in.  I'm not certain it has changed in all of the decades of movies.
Or, is it that they are too cheap to have another one made.",1454112000,,374,4.23943661971831
8410791,4,B003ZSI6PU,"Ok, first of all I was the special makeup effects supervisor for this film when I was just out of college. Basically, I was paid to tell them how to do things which upon seeing the film for the first time a couple of days ago, they never did. Must have used up their stage blood budget, LOL.
Anyway, I can honestly say that this was a schlock laugh fest.

Faith Clift while beautiful was a stone faced zombie throughout the film.

Richard Moll turned in an unintentionally hilarious performance as her husband and author of ""God is Dead"". He doesn't believe in God or Satan and has a wig with shocks of silver hair that are constantly shifting and changing throughout the film. It would make for a nice drinking game, though.

Meanwhile, Satan himself (in the form of an effete womanizer) is being chased by an old Nazi hunter who has found his face in photos over a hundred years old all the way through Nazi Germany.

The great character actor Marc Lawrence (double cast as the old Nazi hunter AND Cameron Mitchell's partner) chewed the scenery trying his best to lift this film up a notch or two.

Poor Cameron Mitchell, once a leading man in Hollywood, was horribly underutilized and misdirected, but he still shone on his own as the police detective trying to solve the case.
The ending was a nice twist, and YES, this is pure schlock, but we laughed our butts off.",1445731200,8,1370,4.485943775100401
8410792,5,B003ZSI6PU,Why would anyone dis this film is beyond me; unless of course their God is not the one represented in this one.  Good and Evil are not one they are diametrically opposed as this film so readily proves.  Mitchell was always one of my fav actors and he does well in this one!  Very well told tale with strong philosophical and Biblical underpinnings for me as a Reverend of the Gospel and being very familiar with the reality that people today are in gross denial about!,1445472000,,468,4.4186046511627906
