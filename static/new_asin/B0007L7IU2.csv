8048098,4,B0007L7IU2,"The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the lawyer is the detective and the solution occurs in a courtroom. A real life court trial is not as dramatic as in fiction. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers with new technology or medical-legal facts, and warned of swindles. The TV shows were simplified and modified versions from the originals or new stories. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but they represent life before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The prices, automobiles, and monetary figures date these stories. They record the styles and culture of the 1950s. The many character actors enrich these stories, their emotions are often read from their facial expressions.

""The Case of the Waylaid Wolf"" begins at the Lamont Engineering Corp. One secretary is asked to work late. What about her car? Loring Lamont Jr. takes Arlene for a ride. What is his intent?

There is a visit to a hi-fi store; we learn what this can mean. Who is OK? Arlene is arrested for stabbing Loring in the back. [Symbolism?] The physical evidence shows Loring's shoes and clothes are clean while Arlene's dress is muddy; this contradicts her story. Perry questions co-workers to get more facts. He surmises why two tickets were issued and Loring's clothes weren't muddy. Madge Elwood has left the state; she helped Arlene. Mr. Albert tells what he did; there is a shocking surprise admission. Mr. Kim tells what he saw that night. The identification of the red convertible leads to a solution that frees Perry's client. The last scene explains the other events. [The 1960 novel is a better and more complex story. Raymond Burr seems to be worried during this film. Was it connected to the absence of William Talman?]
