8325600,4,B000PFU83Y,"A policeman who is originally from South Africa is employeed in Seattle.  He spends his days attending to meaningless calls, all the while he is in an imagined dialog with a gal (in his language which is subtitled and consists of half of the movie) he has met that he likes.  She, however, is with another guy by the name of Jeff.

The policeman is in agony as he wonders if he did too much or not enough.  He comes up with reasons why she has not called. Heartbreaking.  An interesting character study.  Some bare skin and swearing.",1373500800,,533,4.387755102040816
8325601,4,B000PFU83Y,"I enjoyed this movie. It may help that I live in Seattle where it was filmed. It's a dark and beautifully filmed love story of sorts. It's a love story told to the backdrop of ACTUAL police incidents. The writer of the film writes a column called ""Police Beat"" in the weekly publication ""The Stranger"" hear in Seattle. This is not a action or fast paced movie. It is more poetic in nature. Enjoy.",1202083200,9,396,4.364864864864865
