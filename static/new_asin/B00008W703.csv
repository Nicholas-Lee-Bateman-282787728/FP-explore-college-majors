As an educator that offers a course in the Public Health Response to Terrorism, I found this tape terribly produced, tacky, and unprofessional.  The persons responsible for the development of this video are cashing in on the fears of the public.  The only reason I will talk about this in my class is to show students the various types of fear tactics used.  Let's be sensible folks.",1200268800,,535,6.388888888888889
7987398,1,B00008W703,"What can you say about a documentary that tells you that the best way to ""prevent"" terror is to avoid it? Avoid big cities? (geez-thanks), don't fly? (hmmm, I guess we should just walk everywhere), practice racial profiling? (pretty stupid when you consider that the majority of the world (Hispanics, Mexicans, Greeks, Italians, Spaniards, Nepalese, Indians, Jews and on and on could be mistaken for the Terrorists). Not to mention the fact that we are basically painting all Middle Easterners with one brush when it is a tiny minority that have participated in Terror acts. In my life I have come across plenty of blonde blue eyed Muslims and as well as ""Arab-looking"" Americans. Give me a break! Talk about barking up the wrong tree! - All in all a misleading, unprofessional hyped product meant to cash in on the hysteria.",1056067200,23,825,4.858156028368795
7987399,5,B00008W703,"Ever since September 11th, I've been fearful of another terrorist attack on American soil.  I often stay up at night wondering -- If I had been on one of those planes on that fateful morning, would I have been able to fight-off the hijackers and fly the plane to safety?  Since I am not what you'd consider ""strong"" or ""courageous"", and have no formal pilot training, the answer to this question is an unfortunate - ""No"".

So, what else can we do to prevent future terrorist attacks?

This indispensable 60-minute video will answer all of your questions.

The first thing you need to do is -- be prepared.  While hazardous material suits, gas masks, Duct Tape, plastic wrap, and a year's supply of non-perishable food items might seem overly-cautious now, terrorists will be detered from targeting us if they know we'll be protected and well-fed following their attack.

The next thing you need to do is -- pay close attention to the Department of Homeland Security's color-coded Terror Threat Level.  The Terror Threat Level consists of five colors - each representing a level of severity - ranging from green (everything is okay) to red (everything is not okay).  Since most terrorist attacks come with plenty of advanced warning, this tool will help you prepare accordingly.

Finally, you need to speculate on where, when, and what the next attack will be.  By thinking like a terrorist, and making a list of possible targets, you'll know which locations to stay away from and insure your safety.  It also helps to speculate on the terrorist's means of attack.  If you feel like biological or chemical attack is on the way, make sure you are never down-wind.

Other helpful tips include: Avoid big cities, large crowds and flying, be aware of your surroundings, and practice ethnic profiling.",1053388800,4,1795,4.881188118811881
