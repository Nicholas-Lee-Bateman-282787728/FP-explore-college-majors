I knew it under the title ""CRUNCH"", because I actually helped to write some of it. I only bought it to add to my collection. I think it wanted to be Animal House on a high school football team. Not even close.",1424476800,,309,4.081967213114754
8163130,1,B000LPS2Q8,"Well I didn't expect a lot from this 80's teenage/high school movie and even by those standards I was disappointed. The writers blew it big time as they totally botched the whole idea behind these kinds of films. The basic story premise is the long time high school football rival's  led by the legendary ""Bulldog"" Malone and his former assistant Alan Arnoldi meet in their annual game. Bulldog Malone is played by John Vernon and Arnoldi by Robert Forster. Both these actors especially Vernon have done better work in much better films. The writers err in one sense here as neither coach comes across as someone you want to kick butt on the other guy. Bulldog's an old school guy and Arnoldi's an Al Bundy type former star turned loser. Without a strong rooting intrest you lose one of the reasons to watch. The secondary storyline is the grudge match between one teams star QB and the others star Linebacker. The QB character has a braniac girlfriend who's a bleeding heart issues stereotype character. Plus she's the ""good girl"" who won't put out too. The linebacker creates friction between the pair and tries to woo her away from the Qb. Once again these two characters come across as jerks and the girls annoying and really not that hot either. So you really don't care about who gets the girl or if she'll choose one over the other. Poor writing  can kill even a B movie like Heartbreak High. Add in a lack of funny bits and pranks that fall flat,little nudity and poor Norman Fell playing the local sports anchor  he gets little face time and when he does he's the butt of the jokes and Heratbreak High is one film to pass on.",1244592000,,1634,4.551020408163265
