Funimation did a great job with this series and the bonus commentary with the voice actors was interesting and a blast to listen to. The set up is beautiful too. The artwork on the boxset is gorgeous and the bluray and dvds are neatly put together.
I recommend this to any anime fan in general if they want a cheap laugh. It was definetly worth it for me!",1391299200,3,439,4.238095238095238
5928437,5,B00ENNUW8U,"The item came to me in good condition, the show itself was funny. My only down fall on this product was the seller took so long to send it out. I just saying if you get our money right away it shouldn't take you 2 to 3 weeks to send it out!!! All in all the package was well protective and the show was funny!!!",1390348800,,311,3.8
5928438,5,B00ENNUW8U,"This is possibly one of the funniest anime you will ever watch for a long time.  The humor is creative, fresh, and full of energy. What I personally enjoy about it the most is that it doesn't overtly rely on fanservice as a crutch for entertainment. The comedy is quite intelligent and, for the most part, tasteful.  It also gets more and more insane with each new episode.  Its characters are also memorable and off-the-wall; Momiji in particular cracks me up since she's like Bugs Bunny in the form of a teenaged girl. It also has some fairly gripping emotional drama in certain episodes, which serves to flesh out the characters.

Its usage of anime references is also refreshingly hilarious and is implemented competently, so it never feels like a overused gimmick.

All in all, I highly recommend this series if you're looking for a good, original comedy series that will always leave you hungering for more.",1389225600,13,913,4.789808917197452
5928439,5,B00ENNUW8U,It was a good show it was really funny and just a good show with good music opening and end song was good,1388707200,,105,3.608695652173913
5928440,5,B00ENNUW8U,The anime follows closely to the manga. The English dubbing is also very well done. If you like reading the manga then you will definitely like watching the show.,1388448000,,162,4.620689655172414
5928441,5,B00ENNUW8U,"This is a very good comedic anime, on par with Cromartie High School, but from a girl's perspective, it deals with a girl who has so much good luck that she can actually take good luck from others causing them problems, only by the intervention of a goddess of bad luck who can siphon her good luck and use it to fix the problems is this, problem is ""Good luck girl"" doesn't exactly want her luck taken, which leads to chaos between the two.

With several anime references and cameo's, as well the chaos between the main two characters, if your into Comedy style anime i'd definitely pick this one up.",1388275200,4,601,4.414414414414415
5928442,5,B00ENNUW8U,Very funny show and the dub is awesome the characters are so engaging and the parodies to other series were awesome,1387238400,3,115,4.523809523809524
5928443,1,B00ENNUW8U,"I watched this show as a suggestion and found it quite entertaining. You get a DVD and BD release for this series that has English and Japanese languages with English Subtitles. There is some bonus material but it is pretty much all of it is geared to an English Dub fan as opposed to the Japanese Sub fan with the exception of the Creditless Opening and Ending Sequences.

The reason I give this one star is because there are two problems with this release:

1. Botched encoding on the Bluray for the Opening and Ending sequences. FUNimation boasts a TEAM of individuals to handle Quality Assurance for their releases. Anyone watching the series on Bluray will see the Opening and Ending are choppy / skip during playback. This leads me to believe that there was just laziness with the release of the show to report and correct the problem. Note that the Creditless Opening and Ending sequences do not have this issue nor does the original Japanese release. It appears to be reported on the FUNimation FB / Twitter and other Anime forums for the last few days without a public statement. As of 11/20/13, this would be the 3rd botch of their QA within the last few weeks - the others being Artbox Resolution Quality issues with We Without Wings and the Sankarea Video Master issue.

2. LOCKED Subtitles is the other reason for the poor marks. I normally don't preorder FUNimation shows that much. This is due to habit on their part for locking out the subtitles on BOTH English AND Japanese language tracks on playback. To enjoy the product in the original Japanese, you are being forbidden from turning off the subtitles on the fly. This means that if you want to go back and re-watch sequences from an artistic point of view, you just can't without the subtitles blocking the picture. Additionally, if you are  an English Dub fan, they force on the song / sign subtitle track that can also obscure the picture for you too. This means as a consumer, you cannot enjoy the product you wish unless you rip the BDs, use a player that allows you to hide subtitles off the screen, or have a hacked BD Player that allows you to ignore such limitations. Of course, these workarounds are a pain to put into place. Instead of being so paranoid and anti-consumer with such silly limitations, why not just use Geo-Locking like Sentai Filmworks? They usually lock very few of their releases thanks to a system that just makes the BD unplayable in other regions. Of course, asking FUNimation reps this or reaching out to them about this issue is just a dead zone issue as you'll never get a response or something vague back.

I ignored my wait and see approach because of my love of this show only to feel what is now becoming a bit of a burn with FUNimation products - releases that are anti-consumer with shows released that prevent me from enjoying the show in the manor I like. My best recommendation is to not support this release on those grounds while also doing research on releases that are being locked out. The only real way they will care is if people don't support the product because any outcry is usually ignored - look at the upset folks over the upcoming DBZ Season 1 BD release over the fact that they are editing it with a faux widescreen release and FUNimation doesn't seem to care.

Skip it.",1384905600,16,3299,4.573604060913706

5928447,5,B00ENNUW8U,"This 13 episode anime is an underrated gem, and a solid buy for any anime fan.

The main character, Ichiko, was born with too much 'good fortune energy', meaning that she is good at everything, beautiful, rich, and a complete brat. To keep Ichiko's excess of good fortune energy from bringing disaster to everyone around her, a 'god of misfortune' is sent to extract Ichiko's good fortune energy. This leads to a madcap comedy on the levels of Tom and Jerry or Loony Tunes shorts as the misfortune god Momiji goes through an endless array of wild schemes and ridiculous 'god items' to carry out her mission.

 A comedy first and foremost, the closest i can compare this anime to are American Loony Tunes, in the best possible way; the action is zany, wild, and hilarious. It can be difficult to properly translate humor across language barriers (unless you really like puns about Japanese kanji), but the slapstick on display here transcends culture. There are many references to other famous anime titles such as Dragonball Z and Deathnote as well; these are, of course, more amusing when you're familiar with those shows, but that isn't necessary to enjoy the jokes.

Beyond the comedy, the story is a well executed one. Rather than a more common 'cute girls doing cute things' are 'boob-filled shenanigans as several girls vie for milquetoast protagonist', the story is focused on the gradual development of Ichiko's character, and the gradual friendship that grows between Ichiko and Momiji. There is a lot of heart to be found in this show, and avoids becoming too cheesy or melodramatic.

This show is probably not for the under-13 crowd, if you are sensitive about 'fanservice' in anime. There are several scenes of Ichiko or other female characters in a bath or bathhouse (censored with the use of strategically placed soap suds), one of the prominent side characters is a masochist, which is played for humor (to be fair, since he's a god-dog who looks like a chihuahua, it is pretty hilarious). I personally find the fan service in this show less objectionable than in other series, since 1) the characters are never 'posing' for the viewer, 2) these scenes never come at the expense of their worth as a character or feel exploitative, and 3) there are no 'panty shots' (the original manga was actually notorious for this; the artist simply refused to do them). Your mileage may vary when it comes to this sort of thing, but just be aware that some of that stuff is in this show.

If you prefer watching anime dubbed, you are in luck; the english voice cast is fantastic, which is not common for a comedy such as this. Colleen Clinkenbeard, in particular, absolutely NAILS Momiji's character in one of the best dub performances i have ever heard.

In conclusion, if you are an anime fan looking for a good comedy with heart, this is a good pickup. If you have soon the sub already through Hulu, the English dub is worth the price of picking this up.

PS: Keep an eye out for the post-credits sequences, where a character who was prominent in the manga, but not able to make an appearance in the show, points out the scenes in which she was hidden in the background in each episode. After a couple episodes, you'll want to play your own game of 'Spot the Nadeshiko' and see if you can spot her each time.

PSS: If you get the chance, read the manga (called 'Binbougami Gah!'). It is amazing, lasts much longer than this show covers, and actually gets better and better as it approaches the end.",1415145600,3,3503,4.682926829268292

8607038,5,B00ENNUW8U,"A pretty good show over all, more for the laughs than anything else. Here is my review on Good Luck Girl complete series.

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Ichiko Sakura is 16 and in high school, she is extremly lucky. She has a big house, lots of money to spend on what ever she wants. But what she has more than anything is ""Luck"". In fact she is so lucky that the gods above see that her extreme amount of luck is bringing the universe out of balance. So a god of misfortune called Momiji is sent down to earth to fix the problem. Except when someone tells you they have come to suck the luck or as the show calls it ""Happieness energy"" out of you, you would want to fight back too. So the comical battle of the worlds luckiest girl vs a god of misfortune comes into light. Through out the series you see more people who help the plot along like the monk Bobby who is brought to Ichiko to help get rid of the Momiji from haunting Ichiko. Then there is Keita Tsuwabuki who is one of Ichiko's class mates who plays a minor love intress in the story. Now we have Ranmaru Rindo the karate fighting tough tom boy of the show who is extremely loyal and has pink hair. Kikunoshin Suwano who was Ichiko's butler who was employed by her but left after the first episode because Ichiko wanted him to for his own good. Now we have  Momo'o who is a mystical being who is Chihuahua/human, he first comes to help Momiji but then becomes friends with Ichiko. Momo'o is an extreme masochistic, in the show it is seen at times where Ichiko or Momiji (mostly Ichiko) beats him up and hes cant get enough of it, as he says in the anime it turns him on getting hurt and wants to get more hurt for ""pleasure"". Next is Momiji's personal assistant Kumagai who is a teddy bear who doesn't speak but write stuff down to talk. Last is Nadeshiko, she is well I'll explain down in the cons sections about this character.

Pros: this show is funny, it gave me a good laugh. It shows more fun than serious most of the time. In this anime with tiny cut secene it shows the various characters of show impersonating other shows, for instance in the sports episode Momiji (voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard) is show for a moment impersonating Monkey D. Luffy from the One Piece series (which she voice the same character too). In other instances Good Luck Girl also impersonates scenes from Dragon Ball Z and Death Note and other well known anime's. The action when it is here is very good, it does have serious moments at time but it works well. Some scenes can tug on the heart strings and they do it nicely. The characters are loveable, weather you are rooting for Ichiko the MC of the show or Momiji the 2nd MC/minor villian of the show you will love them all!

Cons: I feel they could have pushed this out to a 24 or 26 episode show instead of 13, because they could have more wild adventures and all

Character con: Now for Nadeshiko, as I mentioned above in Manga book she is show and told about a lot more. In the Anime series here she is an annoiance. By that I mean after every episode end credits there is a mini segment called ""Oh Nadeshiko"", now she comes in and explains (first episode only) who she is and shows her very tiny split and half second cameo's on the show. That's it! for 12 of the 13 episodes she is never heard from in the main show at all or even knowticed, she is normally played in the background where you would never look or even in a close up she is shown for half a second but too fast to knowtice to be honest. In episode 13 she has 5 lines in the main episode, thats it. I normally don't count the after credits mini segment as part of the show, Honestly if the anime creators never did this mini segment I feel like I would miss NOTHING at all because her character is so insignificant to the shows plot being in its development or the fact that NONE of any of the other characters in the show even register her existence at all, it would have probley saved them money in the tv shows creation to leave her out entirely.

Price Con: Now for price, I see on here its being asked for today which is 8-24-2015 is 59.97. That is too much for 13 episodes by my asking point, even the newest and lowest price at 38.56 is still too much, this is more of a 19.99 series.

Over all: I liked this series when I saw it, I laughed, I had a good time. IF the price was lower sure I might buy it, but over all I would sergest you buy this series only if you can find it for a lower price",1440374400,,4488,4.19351100811124

8607043,5,B00ENNUW8U,"High school student Ichiko has it all. Good looks, loads of money, boys around her every move, and most importantly, she has good luck. Which is a problem in the realm of Gods, especially the Poverty God Momiji who has been sent to take some or most of her good energy in order to give it to others before Ichiko takes all the happiness from everyone else around her.

Sounds like a simple enough story and the trailer is very misleading which I feel works in great favor of the anime. The trailer makes one believe this is only a comedy and it is indeed very hilarious especially if you've seen a lot of anime, the parodies will make a lot of sense but there's other jokes that can be just as funny. The real surprise is the drama that also slowly builds into the series and proves to work perfectly. The protagonist seems like a real piece of work to put it politely but then her character becomes explained and I feel Ichiko has been developed well enough for a 2nd season to be made. This anime is definitely for adults considering the bits of fan-service, strong language, and sexually suggestive situations/innuendos.

I feel this anime is well worth purchasing for a good laugh as well as to learn something more about the people we encounter in real life; even on the surface the best looking of people have problems. If you enjoyed this, you'll definitely love the more adult anime parody Excel Saga and Baka and Test.",1419379200,,1427,4.505791505791506
