8750252,1,B01BI05CEO,THIS REVIEW IS IN REFERENCE TO THE PRODUCT BY GRAPEVINE VIDEO NOT THE SELLER.  SILVER QUEEN IS A GOOD MOVIE BUT THE DVD HAS ONE OF THE WORST TRANSFORS I HAVE EVER SEEN.TO TOP IT OFF THE AUDIO WHICH HAS A LOT OF BACKROUND MUSIC IS RUNNING AT A SLOW  AND VARIABLE SPEED WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING AND PREVENTS YOU FROM CONCENTRATING ON THE MOVIE.HOW THESE FLY BY NIGHT COMPANY'S GET AWAY WITH SELLING PRODUCTS LIKE THIS IS BEYOND ME!!!! THIS MOVIE DESERVES MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT IT GOT FROM GRAPEVINE VIDEO.,1463616000,3,501,4.434782608695652
