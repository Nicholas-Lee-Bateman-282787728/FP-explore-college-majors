The plot involving the father and son is okay, tho full of cliches and rather overdone, but not awful. The real draw is the music, and the whole film is a nice little slice of the 80s.. Not sure this was ever released in theaters -- decades ago I wrote the blurb for the back of the videotape box, and still remember enjoying the film.",1425945600,,431,4.468354430379747

7826406,5,6302467993,"This movie is a good movie because it is about a young boy and his dad that have a conflict because the dad thinks he can not sing the old songs anymore. The dad finally makes up with his son and he performs live at the doo wop show where his son's band is playing as a back up band for the different groups.
Very good plot and exciting movie.  I recorded this movie a long time ago, but it was not a very good recording and was happy to find it here on Amazon.",1317686400,,461,3.8526315789473684
