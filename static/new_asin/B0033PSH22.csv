8564758,5,B0033PSH22,I had great fun working on this movie! Watching Michelle Meyer and Tim Bowes working their chemistry together is forever a lasting impression as I start a new career in the filming industry. Thank you Mr. Scott R. Thompson for casting me in my small part in this funny comedic movie.,1293148800,,283,4.568627450980392
