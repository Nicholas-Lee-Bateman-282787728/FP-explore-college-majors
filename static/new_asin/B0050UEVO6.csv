4518149,5,B0050UEVO6,So this is a great anime about a former bad guy who doesn't remember being bad or having caused the worlds decay. He struggles to regain his memory as the world blames him for its demise.,1351900800,,187,4.222222222222222
4518150,5,B0050UEVO6,"Wow, this series was simply amazing from top to bottom. This is definitely what I would call top tier. Every aspect of this show is well thought out and very well produced. The animation and background artwork is astoundingly beautiful with music perfect for each and every scene. The style used throughout is unique in the way it looks on screen compared to other anime. It is just a treat for the eyes. The story is amazing as well. All of the characters are complete and their stories told quite well. The overall melancholy emotion of the show fits well with the scenery and stories we are given to watch play out and are a proper homage to the 70's sci-fi feel to the show. The journey this series takes a viewer on is intense and yet very enjoyable. Overall this series is a treat in all aspects. The crew that put this together definitely get a thumbs up on this one, as their time and effort are visible throughout. Simply stated, this anime, is not just an anime series, but is a true work of art from top to bottom and is impressive and a joy to experience. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode. Definitely a must have for any collection out there.",1351641600,9,1156,4.431924882629108
4518151,5,B0050UEVO6,"Anime has come a long way in the past 30 years or so. Casshern Sins is probably one of the top 3 visually enticing animes I've ever seen. I was completely blown away by this show. Casshern is an android that awakens to a ravaged world full of ruined robots and very few remaining humans. He has no memory, but his enemies all want to devour him and are blaming the ruined world on him. He wanders alone trying to discover the truth and find the meaning of existence. The story is slow paced and very methodical. It has a very downtrodden vibe about it. But it's emotionally heavy and very thought provoking.

The animation is unparalleled and the voice acting is also great. The soundtrack fits the mood of the story perfectly. There are lots of interesting characters in this one as well. I am amazed by Casshern Sins. I can't say it's a favorite of mine b/c of the depressing mood of it; I like animes that are more happy. But ignore my personal preference and check it out. Everything about it is top notch.",1349913600,12,1010,4.401069518716578
4518152,5,B0050UEVO6,Casshern Sins is a really beautiful and mysterious anime. The show is sad and dark and keeps you wanting more. Buy it now before the price increases.,1343433600,,149,4.555555555555555
4518153,5,B0050UEVO6,"Casshern Sins is perhaps the very greatest modern anime series. The series is set upon Earth far in the future, possibly thousands of years from now. Robots rebelled against their human masters and took control of the planet in a war which now is almost completely forgotten. A slow-moving but utterly devastating nano-plague referred to as The Ruin has swept the planet, destroying robot and human alike.
  Casshern, greatest of all the robots, awakens in a desert hundreds of years after killing a woman named Luna and therefore unleashing The Ruin. He remembers nothing of his past, not even his name, but to everyone whom he meets he is utterly despised. He then sets off upon a journey of self-discovery and an attempt to atone for his sins...
  To say that this show is emotionally intense would be an understatement. Everywhere one looks can be seen the signs of death, decay, and despair. Plant life is rare, and animal life practically nonexistant. And there are endless armies of Bandits, older-model robots driven by desperation to a life of hunting other robots in an attempt to cannibalize them for spare parts. A rumor has spread across the planet that whomever consumes the hated Casshern shall live forever.
  Throughout the series, Casshern must battle not only the Bandits, but his own brother Dio, who seeks to set himself up as the messiah of the robotic race. The numerous fight scenes wherein Casshern faces sometimes hundreds of enemies are graceful but brutal, waged entirely hand-to-hand, given that the technology to create weapons like guns has been lost. However, the fighting is actually secondary in this show. What really is important are the emotional and spiritual revelations which emerge in the course of the story. The overarching theme is that life itself is indescribably precious, and that even the loss of the smallest of lives is a gut-wrenching tragedy. I dare anyone to watch Episode #9, ""The Flower Which Blooms in the Valley of Ruin"" and not find themselves crying their eyes out for two hours afterwards.
  What really makes this show stand out  are the robots themselves. There are three generations of them, the last of which are so totally human in appearance that the only way to tell that they are not human is a subtle difference in their eyes. But these synthetic humans are far removed from C3PO and R2D2 or Data. In a master stroke, the animators consciously chose to de-emphasize anything which would have highlighted the robot's artificial nature. They possess such utterly beautiful human hearts and souls. They feel sadness, joy, tragedy, and even love. And they can even feel hope, faith, and the deepest of appreciation of Beauty. They even refer to themselves as men and women, and the genders are naturally drawn to one another, just as we are. Japanese animation has always been far superior to the American variety when it comes to matters of emotional warmth, given that the American shows tend to rush everything and to be annoyingly syrupy when it comes to expressions of feeling. What makes the drama in Casshern Sins so effective is that so much of it is unspoken: eyes misting up with tears, a sudden affectionate embrace, a woman's head leaned against a man's chest with her eyes closed in contentment. Even the huge older robots are capable of feeling powerful emotions, in particular one such robot at the end of Episode 9 whose wail of grief is especially heartbreaking. But what really highlights the emotional content is the soundtrack, including two vocal songs, ""Sky"" and ""A Path"", both of which are so hauntingly beautiful that the listener will almost certainly be moved to tears by them.
  Casshern Sins is also full of many religious themes: sin, redemption, atonement, hope, faith, and salvation. There are several messianic characters, each offering deliverance from corruption and death. Finally, there is the promise that there is beauty in life, even in the midst of despair, and that love can be the very meaning of life itself. Casshern Sins shares much in common with The Road, but without that story's utterly hopeless outlook upon life. I would definitely recommend buying Casshern Sins, but the powerful emotional intensity of the show might be too much for younger viewers.",1343433600,4,4268,4.955244755244755
4518154,5,B0050UEVO6,"""Kill Casshern... Devour Casshern...""

The Casshern franchise is one that dates back to the 70's with 'Neo-Human Casshern', with a four episode OVA called 'Casshern: Robot Hunter' later being released.

Then, in 2008, we got Casshern Sins, a totally different tale from the previous ""Save the world/humanity!"" themes present in the previous series's.

One day, an amnesiac Casshern awakens to a world flooded with Ruin- humans are dying off, unable to reproduce, and the once immortal robots are falling victims to rust. The world is on it's last legs, civilization as we know it is about to be wiped out.

There is, however, an odd rumor going about. If someone devours Casshern, they will regain their eternal life. And so sets off Casshern's journeys into the wastelands on his quest to answer- what happened to the world? Why is he not yet affected by the Ruin? Why does he seem to have a true immortality that even other robots in perfect condition couldn't obtain?

Just who was the supposed savior of the world, the Sun Named Moon, and what was his connection to her and the seemingly hopeless situation around him?

Casshern Sins is, in my humble opinion, quite possibly one of the best animes I've ever seen, one I'm willing to put on the same level as Neon Genesis Evangelion and Puella Magi Madoka Magica (and just for the sake of my childhood, hell, let's throw Yu-Gi-Oh! into the mix! ... No? Ok...). The series itself tends to have a very episodic nature- it's primary focus for much of the series is Casshern's quest in itself, and tends to focus much on Casshern's encounters with people and robots (mostly robots) in the wastelands, some of which do not contribute anything to finding the Sun Named Moon. And honestly? It works out well. Yes, some episodes you can skip- a lot of episodes in fact. The plot itself advances very slowly until the end when everything begins to connect with one another, and as such Casshern Sins is sadly not for everyone. Many fans of fast-paced and fighting animes can easily find themselves bored with the world of Casshern Sins. While it does have some fast action sequences here and there, it's important to remember this series progresses very slowly- and in addition to this slow progression, it has an episodic nature thrown in to boot- again, many of which does not contribute to the ultimate quest that drives the main plot and back-story of Casshern Sins. But, who says this is bad in itself? It is an anime (before the end) that you could probably pick up mid-series and figure out what you need to know in 2-3 episodes. However, if you can look past that, you'll find yourself watching and enjoying the truly heartwrenching story of the greatest robot of them all- Casshern. If you cannot stand or sit through slow shows though, you'll probably find yourself unable to enjoy this series.

The soundtrack itself is beautiful- it was done by Kaoru Wada, the man who brought you the soundtracks of Inuyasha, Kingdom Hearts, D.Gray Man, Princess Tutu, and more. You'll probably agree it has a very (for lack of a better word) Japanese sound to it- much in the same way Inuyasha especially did, although the music isn't so limited. This series in particular was amazing with using the music to enhance the current emotion of the scene- especially with sadness.

I can't lie to you- this show is heart wrenchingly depressing at times. It's hard to go into detail, but when almost every episode (especially 2 and 9) makes grown men want to burst into tears, it's night impossible to watch this whole series without feeling at least a tug or two. While you might feel different about it, 'sad' really is the overall theme- even if it doesn't have the effect on you.

The art style is beautiful- especially when you're watching this on Blu-ray! I won't lie- after so much, you might eventually get tired of seeing the wasteland in the background. Even I did near the end since th background itself doesn't bring much to the plate besides just that- wastelands. Sometimes deserts. The characters, robots, and all the likes has extremely good art. It's pretty nice to watch, I won't lie. As you might be able to tell from the art of Casshern on the box, yeah, sometimes the characters are prone to anime hair syndrome, although rest assured- nobody's as bad here as Yugi Muto. As this character has roots in the 70's, and they haven't let old habits die. It shouldn't be so much a problem that it'll bother you, but I'd be lying if I said you won't notice it every now and then.

And finally, honestly, this is a very good price for what they're selling! DVD and Blu-ray for not even 40 dollars, a 16 disc special? That $74 list price is honestly very fair in my opinion, but off of Amazon.. it's a great deal for what you're getting. It really, really is. To be able to watch this series anywhere as long as you can at least play a basic DVD is an incredible deal for such a low price.

One can only hope that this show being on Toonami's new run will attract more people to the flock, and help Casshern rise from obscurity and into a new world. But, I promise you- with the right kind of mind and right attitude, Casshern Sins will not disappoint you!",1342224000,53,5203,4.62012987012987

I recently saw all of Casshern Sins on Netflix, then the next day I actually found out about this complete collection release [the day before its release] and pre-ordered it. If you want an excellent example of a quality Blu-Ray anime release this is a good one. Line detail, motion fluidity, image contrast, and image color use are all beautifully done. Dolby True HD audio track has very good presence and good surround use (not in the same league as Yukikaze - but a very well done surround track!)

4518175,2,B0050UEVO6,"Let me be clear - I don't own this series, I watched about 90% of through a streaming service.

I have watched more anime than I can recollect. I have started watching a series and then realized half an episode in, ""I've watched this before! Woops."" I have seen such a wide range of different topics in anime that I will go ahead and say I am rather well versed. I have been at this since I was about 12. I have seen obscure things, I have watched things that really made absolutely no sense. Then there are series like Casshern Sins that I have seen before.

This series is so painfully boring that I couldn't finish it. The amount of somber drama that is forced into this anime and down your throat was enough to make your stomach turn. There isn't enough substance to this series to keep it interesting. It is basically the same episode over and over again with different characters and situations, but the same outcome each time. Okay I get it, he doesn't remember anything and he is really upset by it! However, how many times can you say the same thing in different ways until you are just beating a dead horse? The story doesn't move, it becomes stagnant in the first 4 episodes. Therefore I will finally say that this series is incredibly hard to watch because it is trying too hard to be artistic. If you want a decently made somber drama with incredible character development and an excellent plot go watch ""Monster"".",1440633600,2,1427,4.46360153256705
4518176,5,B0050UEVO6,Just an absolutely awesome series! Be sure to check out the original series: Casshan from 1973!,1440547200,,95,5.0
4518177,5,B0050UEVO6,"I bought this because I watched it before and liked the action, message and the characters.",1439769600,,91,4.75
4518178,5,B0050UEVO6,"I have never used this one word to describe an anime series but, ""Beautiful"".  One of the first anime I ever watched was Casshan: Robot Hunter back in the early 90s.  I was a teen then.  I'm over 30 and been watching anime since my early teens when the Sci-Fi channel had anime week.  This is one of the most unique I've ever seen.

You can pause almost ANYWHERE in the ENTIRE series and make a quality background out of it.  Visually, the animators did a fantastic job from start to finish.

Now, this won't be for everyone.  While there's Lots of visceral action in every ep., this does not center around action, but rather humanity, choices and burdens.  This is DEEP.  Probably too deep if you're just looking for an action flick.  It'll be so deep, you can't see it.  This is very dark.  But, it's not Demon City Shinjuku dark, but almost a ""hopeless dark"" from the very beginning.

Throughout the series, Casshern is trying to piece together how and why the world has fallen to the Ruin, and what part did he play in it (if any).  This is where the story is very well written: tying in previous Casshern/Cassan story after the fall of Braiking Boss/Black King.  Though, loose depending on what story you pull from.  But it builds on the previous story's to make something viable and believable. You follow Casshern with the same amount of confusion and hints to piece things together as the series unfolds.  This is where we separate from just a dark and depressing story, to something beautiful and tragic at the same time.  Again, not for everyone.

However, what is for everyone is the slow roast of a delicious story, Beautiful visuals, fitting musical score and unique blend of how deep and compelling a ""cartoon"" can be.  I don't cosign on buying every or any anime on blu-ray because it's just not always worth it.  However, I say you'd be missing A LOT to not watch  this in hi-quality format (especially for this many episodes at this price).",1436659200,2,1957,4.560344827586207

I was looking for an anime that would reel me in, peak my emotions and have me wishing that the story wouldn't end as soon as it did - and this one delivered.  The storyline, main characters and graphics are hauntingly beautiful and necessarily dark due to the subject matter.  The background music is stirringly moody and in some cases has a tendency to strike a chord deep within the viewer's heart.  (This viewer, in particular, was moved to tears more than once.)  When I bought this series I really didn't know what to expect as far as the graphics were concerned due to the fact that the cover graphics didn't show me much and I had no prior knowledge of any of the Casshern presentations before this one.  I was quite pleased that the graphics are very well done and, in many instances, richly enhance the story.  The majority of the episodes focus on a single, solitary visit with a character unique to that specific episode.  Each of these characters has an interesting story of their own to share.  Interlace this with the storyline of the main characters at the forefront and you have the recipe for a well-rounded series.  Casshern, himself, experiences serious character development with self-discovery throughout the series.  He shows the courage and conviction of a true hero and wears his conscience on his sleeve.  At times he actually shows tenderness, which, in my book, shows additional strength of character.  The remaining main characters eventually reveal that of which they have evolved, and by the end of the series what they are destined to become.  I couldn't help but become attached to the majority of them.  (There are no unanswered questions about any of them which is not always the rule in some of the animes I've seen before this one.)  I got the full sense of closure at the end, but at the same time, I wasn't left feeling that this will be the last of Casshern.  (I sure hope not!)  I would highly recommend Casshern Sins to anyone looking for a good, solid series.",1425686400,,2053,4.655555555555556

4518199,5,B0050UEVO6,"Let me preface this by saying that I am NOT an anime person.  I can count how many animes (mostly from the nineties) that I actually enjoy on one hand, and I had no interest in expanding that list until I became interested in actually getting into animation as a hobby/career.  I thought it would be good to look for different art and animation styles to study.

So I started a reluctant search for another anime that I would actually enjoy(I am RIDICULOUSLY picky when it comes to anime)...and after saying 'no' to a long list depending on the story line or reviews, I stumbled upon Casshern SINS.  The artwork immediately caught my attention.  A beautiful, soft yet almost decayed look and very different than other animes I'd seen.  After picking through almost every review, I also became interested in the story and decided to take a chance...and watched the entire series in one weekend.

Casshern SINS has got to be one of the most tragically beautiful things I have ever seen.  Everything, from the artwork to the characters to the storyline and animation is breath taking.  The struggle every character goes through is wonderfully portrayed, and I quickly fell helplessly in love with them all.  I gotta admit, the hair took me some time to get used to.  One of the girls' bangs could clothesline someone, and I have no idea how Casshern fits his wild mane beneath that tiny little swim cap thing he puts on for battle, but you get used to it.  You can't help but feel for these guys, and root for them every step of the way.  Even the villains are just seeking what they see as their last hope in a dead world.

The story line, though its horribly heart breaking in some places, is different but a refreshing change to the usual plot you get.  As a previous review mentioned, it is a very slow process but the characters make it enjoyable.  The characters are actually the best part of the whole series in my opinion.  I looooove seeing a character change and grow over a period of time, and you get that in full force with this anime.  Casshern stole my heart from the beginning, and so did Ringo and Lyuze and Dio the second they stepped onscreen.

The animation is beautiful, also.  The fight scenes are raw and 'in your face', and extremely brutal but still graceful, like its an art.  Which is amazing.  I'm a sucker for fight scenes, having been raised on DBZ and Yu Yu Hakusho, and Casshern SINS does NOT disappoint.

All in all, I was beyond impressed, and had no idea what to do with my life after the last episode ended.  If you're looking for something that has a perfect blend of characters, character growth, an awesome storyline and beautiful animation, this is it.  I have never become so obsessed with an anime so quickly before.",1402790400,11,2755,4.550813008130081
4518200,3,B0050UEVO6,"I got this becauss I heard it was good. While the art is good and the monster casshern completely destroys everyone the story was not so deep. I wasn't impressed really, it was interesting but over all it bored me. I'll probably get hate for saying that but it didn't live up to my expectations. The story isn't deep and by the 4 episode I could see how it was going to end. I won't say anything about the story or what happens because I'm trying to keep it spoiler free for those of you who are lookong at getting it. If your on the edge of getting I have to say get it because the price isn't bad on these S.A.V.E. boxes and really the fights are good and the art and voice is great as well. If your looking for a deep life changing story with deep character development keep looking or check it out online.",1402012800,4,809,4.1265822784810124

4518205,5,B0050UEVO6,"Casshern Sins a anime with a great story , excellent animation , and the music fits it to a tee. The story has a lot of twists and turns .A world in ruin as seen through the eyes of a child, the one who brought on the ruin who has no memory and another who wants casshern to atone for his sin. There are new characters in each episode. The english voice cast dose a great job. The music flows with each episode and the animation seem as if to be set in brilliant water colors. It is an anime with alot of heart and soul. This anime is truly one of my favorites.",1391212800,,561,3.9298245614035086
4518206,5,B0050UEVO6,"casshern sin is a story about a wander the land fill with robot, trying to find a clue of what he really is.  it woulda be easier if almost every other robot didn't try to eat him.  see, robot basically rule this world, and somehow, casshern stole their immortality from them, so they understandably piss, also there some rumor that if u eat him, u become immortal, so it kinda like trigun with robot, except instead of a bounty, u get diner :)  anyway, it have two part, the first half is the journey of discovery, where u learn about the world, how the world work and it pretty much a wanderer story.  the second half deal the resolution, we learn what cause all this and what will become of the world(kinda).  Casshern is a sad journey, but it beautiful graphic, wonderful music, great battle scene and good dub make up for it and cause the watcher attention.  i would recommend it as something to watch casually while doing something, but don't marathon it like i did, ur heart might not be able to take it",1387411200,,1010,4.403225806451613

4518209,4,B0050UEVO6,"Most Anime's that come out have clean, well-defined lines as well as neat sharp colors.  This is the common style not only for mass consumption but for ease of the work load by standardization.  While Casshern of course has its roots burried deep in all that makes Anime look like Anime, it's one of very few that have ventured beyond for a more artistic delivery.  At times there are some very sketchy lines, contorted facial features, rapid action that instead of a subdued unmoving backgrounds, every part of many frames are animated to keep the eyes fairly treated.  Casshern is a great story, one that in the first half is nearly perfect, if only the second half could have carried it as gracefully.  Still, the second half isn't one to scoff at, as it's still great and brings with it the finality of the characters that over the course of the show you come to enjoy, even Ringo.  What makes this show great is that it isn't teathered to its source material, and instead of being a tribute, it's a reboot.  This isn't only one of the better animated shows ever produced, but a great story as well.  One that isn't necessarily just for fans of Anime, but people that can appreciate the medium.  I highly recommend the blu ray in particular as this was a modern produced anime, so the clarity and color were practically made with the format in mind.",1376265600,,1353,4.5578512396694215
4518210,5,B0050UEVO6,I loved the art work as well as the story line.  Well worth the time and money invested.  Hope everyone who watches Casshern Sins will enjoy it as much as I did.,1375315200,,161,4.0

4518212,4,B0050UEVO6,"nah, not really... but this was another really good anime. There was a pinch of romance and a whole lotta robotic butt kicking. The fact that the main character felt a deep remorse - even after...well, nevermind. Dont wanna blow it. But this was definately a goob buy and a good show!",1370563200,2,284,4.480769230769231
4518213,1,B0050UEVO6,"I have no idea why people give this junk 5 star, I honest don't get their logic, maybe they just haven't seen hundreds anime and have the experience to compare this junk with the good ones.

Warning: This anime is a total waste of time, this should be a 4 episodes anime but it's 24 episodes, it contains lots of repetitive animation and lots of BS waste of time, very boring and very annoying, trust me, I've watched good anime that has 100+ episodes, even dragon ball z and pokemon is way better than this crappy junk. The only thing I like about this anime is the opening song, that's the only thing!!!

Graphics: -2 stars, this anime was released in Japan in 2008, but the graphics is not modern at all, it's as if it was drawn by immature on papers instead of computer CG, artsy ppl might find it okay, but logical people won't like it.

Storyline: -2 stars, like I said before, this anime has way too much repetitiveness, too much waste of time BS and way too long and move way too slow.

If you have time to waste, be my guest, but if you don't want to waste time, look elsewhere.

Here's some good anime to watch:
Angel Beats!
Aria - The Scarlet Ammo
B Gata H Kei - Yamada's First Time
Clannad
Ef ~ A Tale of Memories
Fruits Basket
Heaven's Memo Pad
Infinite Stratos
K-ON!
Mardock Scramble
Martian Successor Nadesico
Please Save My Earth
Rosario + Vampire
Yu Yu Hakusho

4518215,5,B0050UEVO6,"I'm literally all emotions and no words to express them right now... Luckily, people before me wrote very great and descriptive reviews.
Casshern Sins is a very strange, very confusing, very sad, very emotional, and very happy story in an awkward way. If you think that it's just about robots - drop the idea immediately. Great and emotional music, heavy and gloomy scenery, episode after episode... somewhat simplistic yet very deep style of drawing at the same time... Definitely not for children, that's all I can say... and don't be expecting to feed your 'wild side'... it's not about robots fighting each other, despite that there is a lot of it... it's about feelings and emotions (mostly sad and depressing, but somehow optimistic at the same time)... if you are looking for action and thrill - not your choice. Emotions rule here. Enough said. The only way to understand is to watch. There is really no way to like it or hate it. There is no need to. With this story, all you need to do is watch it and take in all in.",1367798400,10,1027,4.586956521739131

Might be a little too dark for some peoples taste but i think the anime soundtrack, characters and action makes up for it. i watched it previously on Cartoon Networks late night "" Toonami "" and thought it looked amazing.
