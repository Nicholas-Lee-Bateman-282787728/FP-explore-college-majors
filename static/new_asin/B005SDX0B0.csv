4880480,4,B005SDX0B0,"I wondered if the scenes about the pilots' reaction to just prior to be shot down, they froze, waited for the shoot down. Anyway I liked the action!",1394582400,,148,4.321428571428571

4880514,3,B005SDX0B0,Interesting to those of us who can identify different models for aircraft in flight - less so for others. Also does not break new ground in terms of history and has a strict viewpoint that all bombing was directed to military targets.,1424390400,,234,4.595238095238095

4880518,3,B005SDX0B0,Okay but not great.  Interesting interview of the Japanese pilots and the thoughts that occupied their minds during some of the combat sorties included.,1416873600,,152,5.333333333333333
4880519,4,B005SDX0B0,"I love these old B&W war films. The narration, the action, it's all straightforward and to the point. Just the war was. This one is one of the better ones.",1405296000,,155,4.2
4880520,1,B005SDX0B0,"I bought this movie because I am intrigued by the World War II P-38 fighter ace Dick Bong.  His story is one of a pilot who was destined to be mediocre, and yet he became, arguably, the finest pilot ever to fly the not so easy to fly, Lockheed Lightening P-38.

This documentary is billed as having Dick Bong in it, and yet he NEVER is mentioned.",1402704000,6,346,4.149253731343284

8484821,4,B005SDX0B0,"Excellent content, with interviews of the actual aces.  Only downside is the clumsy way someone tried to add a soundtrack to it, with the music often blaring over the narration.",1465516800,,177,4.9

The video, with a run time of less than 30 minutes, offers a discussion of the capabilities of the fighter aircraft and combat pilots in the pacific. If you are interested in a no frills presentation of combat aircraft and tactics of WWII you will enjoy this video.",1454976000,,371,4.8125
