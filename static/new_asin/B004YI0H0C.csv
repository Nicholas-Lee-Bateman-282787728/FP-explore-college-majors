this DVD is one that you should get.",1326067200,,112,4.090909090909091
4499669,5,B004YI0H0C,"I had to write this review in response to the other one here which I think is problematic for a number of reasons. To be honest I am not a huge fan of the series Secrets of the Dead. This episode on the development of mega nuclear weapons during the Cold War and episode on the massacre in Mumbai are superb, however. I suppose if one had three hours one might go into more depth and detail on this subject but given the time limitations this documentary does an excellent job of telling the tale of the Smith's (US) and the Jones's (USSR) attempt to outdo one another by building a bigger bomb.",1320278400,8,595,4.274336283185841

8448343,4,B004YI0H0C,"I found this DVD interesting to watch for info about the USSR's Czar Bomb; I already had good info about the US explosion from ""Trinity and Beyond"" DVD..  The only part that was a bit dull, was the portion theorizing how the Czar designer was pressured to design the Bomb.  I was also hoping for more details along the lines of how the Trinity DVD showcased the shape of the device- that is what the Czar Bomb looked like.  I have seen Photos of  Edward Teller standing beside the huge mock-up of the Czar Bomb.  DON'T get me wrong, the ""World's Biggest Bomb"" is definitely worth seeing and having in one's collection if interested in the subject..",1496534400,,648,4.504273504273504

This documentary originally aired on PBS TV and traces the race to build bigger, more powerful atomic and hydrogen bombs between the US and Russia from the end of World War II to the 1960s.

It includes the shameful story of how the US broke its promises to the native peoples of the Bikini atoll, minimized the risks of testing to armed service personnel and the public at large, and of course similar behavior by the Soviet Union.

Original film footage of some of the tests is included.  Interestingly it was the Soviets who tested the largest hydrogen bomb above ground, in a region of Siberia in which they felt most of the fallout would land on uninhabited land.  Following that test the US and Russia signed a testing agreement that any further tests would be underground, to prevent the spread of radioactive fallout around the world.  Most countries ever since then have utilized the same precautioneven North Korea conducts its tests underground.

More recent weapons have also been smaller than the largest one built.  It was realized that optimal targeting and optimal height above the ground were more important than a larger payload in inflicting maximum damageplus the trend in inter-continental ballistic missiles has been the use of multiple independent re-entry vehicles [MIRVs] to make it more difficult for the enemy to shoot them all down with any type of anti-missile system.  Packing a dozen of the largest possible warheads onto one missile is not as practical as 10 to 20 megaton warheads.  I know you feel much better about this news.  Besides, scientists realized a warhead larger than 50 megatons wouldnt really do much additional damage because at the size of 50 megatons, the blast cloud already extends to the upper limits of our atmosphere.  Any larger, and the additional energy would mostly just radiate into space.  I suppose there could be a use for an even larger warhead for a positive purpose like deflecting a killer asteroid away from a collision course with earth.

Most people prefer not to even contemplate terrible subjects like a nuclear war, and therefore may skip this movie.  Those who do like to be informed may already find much of this material already familiar.  But I at least still picked up a few new facts.  It is well-presented, non-dramatic and historical in approach.",1445644800,,2367,4.899497487437186

8448352,5,B004YI0H0C,"""World's Biggest Bomb"" begins with Hiroshima and Nagasaki and ends with the Bikini Atoll tests -- who nowadays would've believed that ""the bomb"" was once considered so sexy that the bathing suit got its name from the test site?  The move from atomic to hydrogen to lithium, the latter ending up being more dangerous than the first two because of a miscalculation of the structure of lithium.  Truman didn't mention the bomb at Potsdam because he wanted Stalin out of the loop, unaware that Stalin didn't need the loop due to espionage already going on at Los Alamos; the subsequent Soviet test took the U.S. as much off guard as Pearl Harbor, and led to an atomic arms race that got increasingly dangerous as both sides learned the hard way what exactly they were dealing with.",1330905600,5,777,4.705882352941177
