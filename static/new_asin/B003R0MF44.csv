4172325,5,B003R0MF44,"This is an amazing show, great cast - special effects - action - drama - romance - intrigue ... defintely going to buy this when it comes out on DVD - personally I liked the changes for season two, it worked very well IMO. Come on FOX!",1313798400,11,235,4.0212765957446805
4172326,5,B003R0MF44,"This is a fabulous show -- season 2 episodes are great for all ages -- filled with action, drama, humor, and romance. Something for everyone. Good, clean fun for age 7 to 70. A  James Bond movie in each episode!

Season 1 was very good, but Season 2 was more than 'tough guy beats up the bad guys and saves the chick'. The action/stunt scenes in season 2 were more relevant to the story -- it was overall more mature and could appeal to a wider audience.

All 5 cast members are talented actors, and there is great chemistry between them.  The writing is witty, funny, and very entertaining. The direction and stunts are also of high quality. You can watch each episode several times without getting bored. The stories were developed logically from episode one to thirteen. Each of the characters is given the limelight in at least one episode so you get know them well; and there is this  burgeoning romance that is subtle, yet not overly stretched out, like in many of the other shows on TV.

Some of my  favorite episodes were episode 1, 8, 9, 12, and 13: Episode 1 is an action-packed story and a great introduction to the two new cast members of the show; 8 has two parallel stories with action, humor, and a nail-biting finish; 9 has great drama and visuals; 12 is a thrilling narration; and 13 is a spectacular season finale. The season ended well -- smart ending that  sort of tied loose ends if the show wasn't renewed, and yet with a twist in the end that leaves room for the next season.

Episode 2 is about Chance, 3 about Ames, 5 about Winston, and 10 covers Guererro. Baptiste from season 1 returns in an action packed episode 4 and the Christmas episode (6), while limited in action, and probably the least popular one, had a few funny parts - a jab at suburban life.",1303516800,42,1782,4.425076452599388
4172327,5,B003R0MF44,"Anyone who's watched the show knows exactly who Guerrero is and what he's capable of. Still, when he's framed for murder and ends up in prison Chance and Winston do what they can to find out who framed him...and why. At first I was afraid they would cut him lose from the team but as the show progresses you realize just how close knit these three guys are. After all, a good friend will bail you out of jail but a true friend will be sitting there with you, ""we had a great time didn't we?"" Or was it, ""I'm the guy who robbed Gun World?""",1302912000,2,538,4.084905660377358
4172328,5,B003R0MF44,"Season 2 of Human Target is fantastic; you can watch it over and over again -- for the action, drama, humorous dialogues.  Great production, actors, and story-line.  This is a wonderful show for all ages.

 This episode  ""Ilsa Pucci"" is one of the best of this show: a great story, with a lot of action and the introduction of 2 new cast members. Masterfully produced, it also provides a smooth transition to the changes in season 2.

Some of my other favorite episodes were episode 8, 9, 12, and 13: Episode 8 has two parallel stories with lot of action and humor, 9 has great drama, 12 is a suspense-filled narration, and 13 is a spectacular season finale.

 Episode 2 is about Chance, 3 about Ames, 5 about Winston, and 10 covers Guererro. Baptiste from season 1 returns in an action packed episode 4 and the Christmas episode (6), while limited in action had some funny parts - a jab at suburban life.",1301529600,12,905,4.50920245398773
4172329,5,B003R0MF44,"Season One of Human Target was a little choppy in the beginning. I've always been a big fan of both Mark Valley and Jackie Earle Haley, so I kept watching, and I was REALLY glad I did. The show really started to gel beautifully in the last third of the season, when they started to incorporate more of Haley's character, Guerrero, and toned down the animosity between him and Chi McBride's character, Winston. Later, this particular dynamic became much less serious, and more of a tug-of than an actual war. By the end of the first season I was completely hooked. I LOVE my USA network shows, Memphis Beat and Leverage, but this became my favorite. Could NOT wait for the second season. The show received three Emmy nominations and developed a VERY loyal following.

When, at the end of the first season it was announced that two women were going to join the cast I was skeptical. Most of my favorite shows have strong women characters, but this just didn't strike me as the right vehicle. It was just so perfect as it was. When the characters were revealed, I was NOT happy, and neither were MOST of the fans, from what I can gather. A green young woman with an attitude problem and a lack of commitment? A ""hands-off"" investor who decides to meddle, change all the guys and the way they do things in a whiny, self righteous manner? In real life, these women would get these guys KILLED. BAD MOVE. And when they made Guerrero into a babysitter, I thought it was all over. BUT luckily that little plot line faded out, and still the magic of Chance, Winston and Guerrero pulled this show through.

So the question is (as it pretty much ALWAYS is...) Why can't Fox let a show develop without screwing with it? This show was PERFECT at the end of the first season. They take it in a BAD direction, they delay the start of the second season, they change the night, pre-empt it, change the time to make it follow American Idol (Dude...really?) and then they're not happy with the results, DESPITE the fact that their loyal fans followed it through EVERY combination and permutation. Should watching your favorite show be an obstacle course???

And still, now, they can't decide whether or not to renew this show. After the fiasco of Terriers on F/X, I will NEVER get caught up in a Fox show again if they cancel Human Target. It's just too painful to have your favorite shows pulled right out from under you, Emmy nominations and loyal fans not withstanding.

I highly recommend this show on DVD to anyone who enjoys the new action/drama/smattering of comedy vehicles, such as Burn Notice and Leverage. GREAT chemistry between the original cast members, and stories you WON'T figure out, even if you are cursed with ""can always figure out the ending-itis.""",1301011200,89,2751,4.619631901840491
4172330,5,B003R0MF44,"I have been a fan of Human Target ever since episode 1 of season 1. The action scenes are great, and profanity and lasciviousness are minimal. (You don't need sex, profanity and nudity to have a great action flix.)
In my opinion, episode 1 of Season 2 is the best episode of the entire two seasons, where two new characters are brought in. I watched it in HD, and in addition to the action, I paused the player more than once to gaze at the terrific scenery.",1297555200,12,458,4.275862068965517
4172331,1,B003R0MF44,"Okay, I know it's just TV, and I shouldn't expect too much, but really, a Christmas episode?  This is not the type of series that lends itself to such a treatment.  I felt bad for the characters and the actors for the entire episode.  If you like Human Target, do yourself a favor and skip this episode.  It does nothing to advance the storyline.  It has horrible music throughout, albeit on purpose.  The father of the suburban family is so annoying that you hope he dies.  In fact, the whole family is pretty irritating.  Chi McBride in a santa costume should never, ever have happened.  Not that it mattered in this train wreck, but the plot made absolutely no sense, and the fight scenes were poorly filmed and fakey, not like the usual fight scenes.  This was the worst episode of any TV series ever.  I hope they can all recover from this ordeal.  I enjoy this series, even though it not my favorite.  (Dexter.)  They are trying too hard to find a gimmicky formula to boost ratings, and they are thumbing their noses at the people who actually like the show as it is, or was.",1294012800,,1081,4.4213197969543145

4172396,5,B003R0MF44,Human Target was one of the best shows I've ever watched for a series. After season one I waited for season two to come out on DVD. Its hard to believe the Warner people not releasing this great series on DVD yet?

If anyone is reading this, and know someone in Warner (Fox) or anyone that knows someone in the industry, something should be done to bring back Human Target, of get season 2 on a disc so the people that loved this series can view it.

Granted, the first season was better than the second, but I think they both had a lot of fun to offer.  Why do the best shows always get cancelled after one or two seasons?

Anyone know why this isn't available yet for purchase (other than Warner sucks)?  I'm not a huge fan of the lead actor but he is actually cast very well for this role.  Stunts, fights, and action sequences are amazing.  The characters are well written and perfectly cast.  I'd REALLY like to watch this season again.",1388620800,2,421,4.56

4172459,3,B003R0MF44,"Really this show shouldn't have changed anything from Season 1. Adding women mixed it all up into a mess. Totally wasn't necessary. Loved Mark Valley and Chi McBride, all of the actors in season one. I really feel the addition of the female thief and the female financier ruined the show. Can't I have at least one show that isn't about shoving romance down my throat? The preoccupation with sex in TV shows is ridiculous, and a cop out. What made Season 1 great was the cases and characters, not romance or sexual tension. Stick with the great writing. I have a faint hope that someday, someone will try to remake this series without the need to make it all about pairing up the men and women, the real action is more than enough without that other kind of action.",1373760000,5,765,4.4714285714285715
4172460,5,B003R0MF44,Mark Valley is great in everything he is in and being the star of this show is just a fun part for him. The super spy that's not a spy like the man with no name. Saving the people that hire him and his great cast. He is like James Bond with a fun child attitude. Tough as they come and a real human being at the same time. Chi McBride as the ex-cop that is smart and wanted to make more of a difference acts as the head of the agency. Jackie Earle Harley is priceless as the little guy with a reputation for toughness that makes the baddest of the bad tremble in fear.  You will love this show and should get Keen Eddie that Mark Valley was so funny and incredible in!,1358294400,2,668,3.948148148148148

I liked that it contained plenty of drama and action but also quite a bit of humor. I also enjoyed the interactions between the characters within the group. The story lines were pretty good and the stunts they created added drama and realism to the show.

4172462,5,B003R0MF44,"I, like many 24 fans were sadden by the conclusion of the series.  However Human Target filled a void and was in my opinion a winner from start to finish.  After reading some of the other reviews, I see why FOX has a serious problem retaining a positive image and fan base.  The entire cast of Human Target should be recognized for their outstanding work and as difficult as it may be to reassemble this production, maybe another network would support and appreciate having this show in their line up.  Maybe retaining Kevin Hooks would rejuvenate the series.

Amazon, at very least, make the entire season 2 of Human Target available to rent and purchase.  Get the licensing agreement settled.  Its been too long now.

4172523,1,B003R0MF44,"Season one adapted for television by Jonathan E. Steinberg and scored by Bear McCreary was one of the highlights of television in the last several years. It was like watching a new action hero being born in the vein of Indiana Jones, Bond and Borne but who could stand alone on his own two feet. Each episode was in the form of a mini movie each week which never took itself too seriously and virtually every episode was a gem. The season one finale was epic and promised so much. Added to this the supporting cast had two of the greatest actors and characters to grace the TV screen and all three main cast had great chemistry.

So now we have season two taken over by Matthew Miller who had no idea about what worked in the first season and ruined it all by adding two new characters (Ames and Pucci) that not only had no point but were shoe horned into ever scene and forced down the viewers throats, Think Puccy from the itchy and scratchy cartoons and that will sum up the feeling of most fans of this show about the new additions. Also one of the worst things Miller did was fire McCreary and change the amazing music and theme tune. All the chemistry of the team is ruined by bad scripts and terrible story lines. Guerrero gets a new sidekick Ames which takes away all the mystery of the character because he becomes a babysitter and then we start to learn about his back story which was teased and suspenseful in season one but now they start turning his back story into an episode of Maury. Winston has no use any more as Miller doesn't know what to do with him as all attention is spent on Ames and Pucci. The main character Chance gets turned into a clumsy and idiot male and no trace of the great action hero even exists anymore. Along with all the bad decisions made for this second season if you were waiting for any conclusion to season one's cliff hanger finale do not get your hopes up in the slightest they will be crushed within a couple of minutes.
Basically anything that worked in season one was thrown out the window when Miller was hired and he tried to turn the show into Chuck(which he still worked on at the time) mixed in with Greys anatomy. Season two is not a continuation of Human Target in season one and has sullied my view of the show, Season one I have watched again and again and still find it entertaining were as season two I watched and never want to watch ever again.

If you do not believe me about how bad this show became under the new management of Matt Miller then just watch the christmas episode(Yep that's right a christmas episode) and tell me I am wrong. There are so many other things that are wrong with this season, I really could write a whole novel critiquing each episode but I will leave it there. STAY AWAY FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!

So now we have season two taken over by Matthew Miller who had no idea about what worked in the first season and ruined it all by adding two new characters (Ames and Pucci) that not only had no point but were shoe horned into ever scene and forced down the viewers throats, Think Puccy from the itchy and scratchy cartoons and that will sum up the feeling of most fans of this show about the new additions. Also one of the worst things Miller did was fire McCreary and change the amazing music and theme tune. All the chemistry of the team is ruined by bad scripts and terrible story lines. Guerrero gets a new sidekick Ames which takes away all the mystery of the character because he becomes a babysitter and then we start to learn about his back story which was teased and suspenseful in season one by turning his back story into an episode of Maury. Winston has no use any more as Miller doesn't know what to do with him as all attention is spent on Ames and Pucci. The main character Chance gets turned into a clumsy and idiot male and no trace of the great action hero even exists anymore. Along with all the bad decisions made for this second season if you were waiting for any conclusion to season one's cliff hanger finale do not get your hopes up in the slightest they will be crushed within a couple of minutes.
Basically anything that worked in season one was thrown out the window when Miller was hired and he tried to turn the show into Chuck(which he still worked on at the time) mixed in with Greys anatomy. Season two is not a continuation of Human Target in season one and has sullied my view of the show, Season one I have watched again and again and still find it entertaining were as season two I watched and never want to watch ever again.

If you do not believe me about how bad this show became under the new management of Matt Miller then just watch the christmas episode(Yep that's right a christmas episode) and tell me I am wrong. There are so many other things that are wrong with this season, I really could write a whole novel critiquing each episode but I will leave it there. STAY AWAY FOR YOUR OWN GOOD! IF YOU LIKED SEASON ONE IGNORE THIS SEASON WAS EVER CREATED!",1324166400,15,2828,4.333962264150943
4172525,5,B003R0MF44,"Fox stinks for canceling this amazing show that is, by the way, even better than Burn Notice, and Warner stinks for not releasing the second and, unfortunately, final season on DVD! We purchased the first season on BluRay, yet after watching and rewatching it, along with the limited special features, none of us can enjoy the second season--with or without BluRay. It is a shame and it is inconsiderate. Hubby and I keep hoping another station will pick it up and resume the best show in its genre. Something similar happened with The Game, so it is not without hope! Too bad it only received nominations, for had it won, we would all still be enjoying the cast, main storyline and each episode's pure awesomeness.  In the meantime, RELEASE SEASON 2 ON DVD, but the ultimate goal is that someone BRING BACK HUMAN TARGET!",1322179200,4,821,4.701388888888889

8402823,4,B003R0MF44,"The show, when it aired on my area, had the last two episodes pre-empted for some political mess. After faithfully watching, I never got to see the last two shows. They were broadcast back-to-back with no repeats that I could find. Now, I have been waiting forever to have this come out on DVD or some streaming format or SOMETHING, ever since. WHY is the second season still unavailable? It makes absolutely no sense. They should be getting all the mileage out of a 2 season show that they can. It shouldn't have been cancelled like it was in the first place.  The SHOW gets 5 stars. The production company or network or whoever owns this show this day get none.",1525651200,,663,4.479338842975206

Otherwise, there would be no reason not to release the second season! So, settle it already!!",1490313600,2,298,4.96

8402828,5,B003R0MF44,"Amazon video on demand LIES!!! Awesome 2nd season of compelling and entertaining action with an amazing and diverse cast, recently caught on El Rey Network. Came to Amazon to purchase, but no, NOT AVAILABLE despite the false advertising that it is available for purchase on Amazon video on demand. Aaargh! Robert Rodriguez's network acquired the both seasons to broadcast somehow, so it's out there. Please Amazon, please, get this to sell to fans. Even though NBC cancels great shows for reality competition garbage lately, doesn't mean the work put into brief but amazing storytelling should be lost forever to the past. So much better than the comic book shows now on CW because HT doesn't waste precious time on repetitive relationship bilge that pads their runtime.
