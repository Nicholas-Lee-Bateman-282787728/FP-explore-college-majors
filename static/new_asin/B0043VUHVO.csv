8415346,5,B0043VUHVO,The Rainer Werner Fassbinder segment is priceless ... what balls to show himself and his feelings ... absolutely brilliant.,1485302400,,123,5.526315789473684
8415347,5,B0043VUHVO,"Released in 1978, this series of short films (including those of RW Fassbinder and Volker Schlondorff) reflect on the demise of the first generation of the Baader-Meinhof group who terrorized West Germany in the early 1970s. The group had many supporters in West Germany originally, before they began killing people. The leaders of the group took their lives in prison on 18 October 1977. This film is not for everyone, probably only those interested in the group and post-war Germany history. But, those who are interested in the period will find this film indispensable. Also highly recommended for those interested in the New German cinema.",1366416000,,643,5.133333333333334
8415348,2,B0043VUHVO,"The other reviewers here capture the essence of this film Suffice to say, a film made with a sense of urgency by the film makers horrified by the direction of their society, with a simple message ""When a things become horrific enough, it doesn't matter who started them, all that matters is that they stop""

So... what's the problem? Its a $20+ DVD, which contains a 4:3 image which is pillarboxed all the way through on a 16:9 TV. Unfortunately, the 4:3 image was a letterboxed version of the original film, so what you end up seeing is a small movie image surround by a black frame. Not good enough.

Perhaps its just my setup, but....",1337904000,3,637,4.482758620689655
8415349,4,B0043VUHVO,"Alexander Kluge along with several other filmmakers including Rainer Werner Fassbinder, present a stark look at the effects of terrorism. It is a series of non-fiction and fiction stories that were inspired by the kidnapping and murder of a prominent industrialist by a German terrorist group 30 years ago. The film opens with the funeral of the industrialist and ends with the funeral of the terrorists. In between we see all different areas that are affected by the terrorist act. We see a filmmaker trying to get the meaning of it all (Fassbinder) and a schoolteacher trying to understand her German history by investigating. The film holds strong even today and is well worth a viewing. A powerful film that should be required viewing.",1322265600,2,739,4.967741935483871
8415350,5,B0043VUHVO,"Deutchland in Herbst is the long-unavailable anthology film consisting of 11 members of the New German Cinema's reactions to the 1977 state of siege in West Germany in the wake of the Red Army Faction's final wave of terror (the kidnapping and murder of industrialist Schleyer, the hijacking of a jet plane to Somalia, subsequently stormed in a shootout by German commandos,the institution of martial law, the mass suicide of the leaders of the Baader Meinhof crew in the supermax prison at Stannheim) is due on DVD next month; while luminaries such as Alexander Kluge and Volker Schlondorff contributed film essays, and there's an abundance of bone-chilling documentary footage on display,
the entire enterprise is overwhelmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder's segment: a mind boggling piece of literal self exposure, an ersatz documentary wherein he gets drunk and coked out on camera, strips naked, abuses his mom and boyfriend Armin (who killed himself shortly thereafter, precipitating In a Year with 13 Moons, which is a sort of sequel to this piece), and listens in shock as his mother reminisces fondly about life under Hitler. All this happens in RWF's flat, while the bad news getting worse concerning incipient martial law and terror blares on the TV in the background. I suspect this seeming reality-TV precursor freak show was tightly scripted, and it stands as one of the most transgressive moments in a very transgressive career -- at a moment where the German intelligensia feared Germany was sliding into fascism via a demented and violent terroristic left wing and an opportunistic right wing erasing civil liberties, RWF used his own body to point the finger at himself, as an authoritarian bully in his personal life, rather than at strawmen in the government or the audience, an act of pretty much unparalleled courage for a filmmaker. After seeing the ghastly mental and physical state RWF exposed to the camera here, RWF's fatal overdose in 1982 came as no surprise --  it actually is a wonder he made it through another four years and more than half a dozen more masterpieces, including the BRD trilogy, 13 Moons and Berlin Alexanderplatz. In a weird way, I think the parallel crises in his personal life and in Germany's political landscape galvanized him, and gave him a renewed creative energy and may actually have arrested his self destructive spiral for a time.",1290038400,18,2387,5.0430379746835445
