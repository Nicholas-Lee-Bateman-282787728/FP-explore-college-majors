A man wants to see Lady Beatrice, he wants what is rightfully his. He is rejected. A letter asks for Sherlock Holmes help about a sensitive topic. Sir Robert has put everything on a horse race. His sisters pet Spaniel Jasper was given away. There was a human bone in the heating furnace! Holmes and Watson visit the local inn and take Jasper for a walk; later they go to Shoscombe Hall. Dr. Watson goes to see Lady Beatrice; Holmes inspects that furnace then the house.

He inspects the evidence collected with a microscope. Sir Robert learns about the visitors. Holmes goes to meet Sir Robert at home and discovers the truth! Sir Robert takes full responsibility for his actions, and explains what he did. The mystery is solved. Shoscombe Prince won the race, Sir Robert had regained his fortune. Dr. Watson won twenty guineas, Mrs. Hudson won ten, by betting on Shoscombe Prince.

A story about a female impersonator is unusual among the collection. The story of a man who stakes his future on a horse race is a moral lesson for all against gambling.",1494374400,,1084,4.664921465968586

This movie is based on the story ""The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place"" (1927) written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).

This episode involves a brother and his ailing sister who live in a mansion called ""Shoscombe Hall"" (pronounced Shahs-cum Hall).  They own a stable called ""Shoscombe Old Place"" where they keep their prize-winning horse ""Shoscombe Prince.""

A principle creditor who helped finance the mansion has suddenly disappeared.  Coinciding with his disappearance is the discovery of a human bone in a furnace.  The head-trainer at Shoscombe asks Sherlock (Jeremy Brett) to investigate.

Keep your eye on the sister's pet dog ""Jasper.""

Brett (as usual) does a good job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.  Also look for a young Jude Law as a want-a-be jockey.

Finally, the costumes, background music, attention to detail, and cinematography are quite well done.

In conclusion, this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the story it's based on!!

(1990;  50 min;  British drama;  made for TV;  full screen)

7829087,4,630267879X,"""Shoscombe Old Place"" was actually the last Sherlock Holmes story, but was filmed in the middle of the series, probably because it is not as weak as some of those which were included in the later ""Memoirs."" The adaptation is strong, adding a few thrills via a breaking and entering escapade by Holmes which does not occur in the story. Jeremy Brett is clearly not as fit as he was in the earlier series, but his voice is still strong, and he gives his usual fine performance. Welcome back to Michael Cox, the original producer of the series, who returned for ""The Casebook."" One of the recurring conceits of the series, that of Holmes throwing paper around as he searches for something, does start to feel a little shopworn here, but in general a good episode. Jude Law has an interesting part in what must have been one of his earliest TV appearances.",981072000,8,852,4.57516339869281
