The acting is amatuerish.
The writing is amateurish.
It's not even the B-gore film that it pretends to.

5370704,1,B009X484OS,"The entertaining part of this movie is pointing out all the mistakes. It may be fun if you play a ""find the mistakes"" drinking game. For example, a character gets stabbed in the back and blood shoots out. 10 seconds later they show the same character from behind in a completely clean t-shirt.

This is not the Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters that you are probably looking for.

Over acted. Poorly acted. Predictable action. So bad it is laughable.",1358467200,3,447,4.6455696202531644

5370706,2,B009X484OS,Wasnt sure when the new (2013) version of Hansel & Gretel: witch hunters was out. The image and explanation to this movie were missing so it was confusing. The movie wasn't what I expected. Very gruesome but watchable and almost laughable due to its cheesy nature. Not worth the money.,1358294400,4,285,4.72
5370707,3,B009X484OS,"The majority of the movie I found little more than annoying. I am so tired of movies that always have to
start teenage actors and actresses. They tend to overact so badly its annoying. I don't understand why they
cant have movies where the stars are more in their 30s or 40s a little more seasoned. The two main stars
are terrible actors. The boy is the worse of the two. They make the antagonist almost invincible and these two
basically a couple of screaming idiots with little too any common sense. Overall a low budget bore I cant even
imagine buying this DVD.",1358208000,,564,4.4326923076923075
5370708,5,B009X484OS,I just watched this movie and loved it! It was very scary and kept me on the edge of my seat. I disagree with the previous reviewer and think it had some great acting in it. Dee Wallace was great in her role as the witch. She changed so quickly from the sweet bakery owner to the deranged witch. Jasper Cole did a wonderful acting job as one of the deranged twins. Overall I loved the movie!,1357948800,5,391,4.090909090909091
5370709,2,B009X484OS,"The story of Hansel and Gretal has been turned into a bad slasher film by the folks at Asylum. The film opens with a rather heavy set woman being baked alive. They actually stick the proverbial apple in her mouth. After the credits we move to the mountain town of Candlewood, where at the Gingerbread House, Lilith (Dee Wallace) serves up her world famous meat pie to a customer. Not too hard to figure out.

Gretal Grimm (Stephanie Greco) works for Lilith, a person she has taken a shine too. After a family squabble Hansel Grimm (Brent Lydic) runs off into the nearby mystic woods, that no one has ever ventured into. Gretal chases after her brother.

The film digresses into a dungeon imprisonment film complete with goons. The ageless Lilith's powers are chemical and not supernatural.

The picture takes us into the action early. Not much build up. Unfortunately the rest of the film involves escape attempts and battling the captors in a very ""B"" horror/slasher type of fashion.

Brent Lydic's acting was noticeably bad, as was much of the supporting cast. The script was trite.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Sara Fletcher in bra/panties. Some torture/blood. Cannibalism. 1 1/2 stars. If you are not a fan of Asylum's bad films, I would suggest you take a pass on this one.",1357948800,14,1295,4.763392857142857

I suspect the makers hoped that would happen. Dee Wallace is good in this movie but her role as the witch can't save it. Suitable for scaring grade school to pre-teens.

5370719,3,B009X484OS,"If you seen the other B-rated movie of Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft (2013), than this movie is slightly better in every category.

This movie has really no spacial effects but one or two. The rest of it is done with props and that was a much better way to go overall than trying to do cheap CGI.

This movie story wasn't bad. I kind of enjoyed it. They use a similar story but added more twist to the story and I liked that they tried that compared to what I saw in the other B-rated movie.

The whole casts did a much pretty job of acting in this movie than in the other B-rated movie.

The directing was great for the cutting and editing of scenes. There was almost no drag and the movie moves at a fast pace like an action movie.

Overall, I give this an average grade. It's not the best movie in the world, but it goes pretty far compared to the other B-rated Hansel & Gretel.",1384819200,,891,4.127167630057803

5370722,4,B009X484OS,"From the reviews I read I expected this movie to be unwatchable (I tried to watch Hanger and just couldn't sit through it-bad acting and looks like filmed with camcorder); however, I was pleasantly surprised.  I found the movie enjoyable.  The camera scenes were not too dark and the I had no problem seeing what was going on.  Dee Wallace played a good bad witch.  The other acting was questionable and no double the characters made some really bad decisions but if not for the bad decisions they wouldn't be in the position to get killed off.  There is a gore but nor any gross out type like the eyeball coming out of socket in Hostel.  I found the part with Hansel doing a self cannibalism act on his arm funny (I have an odd since of humor).  Much like Motel Hell, we all know what the primary ingredient in the meat pies.  The witch's character did not have any cheesey supernatural special effects which I was glad about....she was just an evil old woman who lived along time.",1374537600,,982,4.446927374301676

This one is just terrible. The acting is bad even for a low budget horror film. The script is awful (again, even for a low budget horror film).

It's too bad because the premise wasn't too bad. With a decent script, director, actors, and, well basically anyone who remotely associated with this film, it could have been a watchable film.

5370744,4,B009X484OS,"In this modern retelling of the classic tale by The Brothers Grimm, two teenage siblings try to escape a psychotic recluse from within her her house in the woods.

What I liked most about The Asylum's Hansel and Gretel is that they took the classic story and made it into a slasher film. I agree with Dread Central wholeheartedly, Hansel and Gretel is a pretty damned good horror movie. I'll give it that. However, as a modern retelling of the classic tale, I feel it would have been alot better if it were a period slasher film. As good as the film was, I just couldn't take it seriously...especially with the lead characters named Hansel and Gretel. How many people do you know or have you known with those names? At the moment, I'm 45 and I've never met any male or female with those names. The acting, for the most part, was fair. The story was decent and the gore was enough to satisfy any slasher fan.

I'll admit, although I do support The Asylum and their movies, through the years- their films have been hit-or-miss. I'm not so quick to run out and buy every release that comes out. I do rent them, though, and make a judgement based on whether it's good enough to buy or not.  Do I think Hansel and Gretel is worthy of a purchase? Well- here's how I look at it...as a horror movie, Hansel and Gretel is pretty dadgummed good. As a modern retelling of the Grimm classic, not so much. If you can get past that- I'd get it for my collection. If not- I'd pass this one up and look for the next Asylum hit.

As hard as people find it to believe, The Asylum does have a good catalog of worthy releases worth picking up...even some originals. I see a time in the forseeable future when The Asylum will be looked at as a legitimate film company(much like Full Moon Pictures) and not so much as a 'Mockbuster' maker. The last three or four movies have been worthy purchases.",1361750400,,1875,4.348571428571429

First of all, this is a slasher flick which is not what we were expecting.  Bad us, I guess.  I'm not a fan of slasher movies so that was the first disappointment.  It may be that this fits the bill of a slasher film.  I don't really know since I haven't liked watching them in more years than I want to admit here.  Second, ALL the characters were STUPID.  Just. Plain. Stupid.  I stopped expecting anyone to get out alive or even caring.  Frankly, they all deserved to die.

That's right---ET's sweet mother goes deliciously over the top as Witch Lilith, who moonlights as loving proprietor of the Gingerbread House, world famous for its yummy meat pies (think Sweeney Todd).  Dee is given the best lines.  My favorite is her twist on Bob Marley's classic I SHOT THE SHERIFF, which I won't spoil for any future viewers (all 3 of them!).
Don't expect a great movie--after all what kind of parents whose last name is Grimm would name their twins Hansel and Gretel.  Maybe Beowulf and Grindl would be more apropos?
But hey what do you expect from a movie allegedly budgeted at $135,000 and filmed in South Dakota?

This is one of their better efforts, which is not to say it is particularly good, but it's more watchable than some of the truly terrible stuff they have put out.  Dee Wallace is the secret weapon here.  She knows she's not making an Oscar contender, and she camps it up in great style.  She's really the best part of the film.  The actors playing Hansel and Gretel are eye-candy, though they are both written to be rather insufferable and one-dimensional.

5370757,4,B009X484OS,"I must admit that I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with most films from Asylum. With over 50 movies in the can, the production company has yet to lose money on a single feature. Often from the time a title is announced to the moment the film is available to purchase is less than six months. This is cynical filmmaking to say the least but there is something ingenious about the business side of this sort of low brow end of movies approach. Is this really anything different than what Roger Corman did in the 60s and 70s? Joe Dante's Piranha was a shameless rip off of Jaws. The Asylum's Hansel and Gretel is a shameless rip off of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. The real question to ask...does this rip off work or is it even worse than the ""blockbuster"" it is trying to capitalize on. Let's take a bite out of Hansel and Gretel.

As Hansel & Gretel begins we witness an overweight girl tied up in shackles trapped in a dark and dreary basement. She manages to get herself free and she runs out of the house and into the woods only to find herself trapped yet again. An apple in the mouth and some seasonings and she has become the next meal for the family who lives in the house. After ""treated"" to the opening Saw ""homage"", I was already tuning myself out of the film. But then something strange happened. The movie developed a sense of humor about itself and it went from being a chore to sit through to becoming one of the more entertaining movies of the last few years. We have our two heroes (Hansel and Gretel, of course) on a race against time as they battle the delightfully evil Dee Wallace as the witch. But I mean Dee Wallace runs a bakery that sells meat pies called The Gingerbread House. How great is that?

I'm been complaining lately that there haven't been enough good-bad horror movies lately. Horror movies that aren't exactly great but are shamelessly entertaining. The Asylum's Hansel and Gretel completely fits the bill. Not only is this Asylum's best work to date, it is also their most enjoyable work yet. A terrifically over-the-top performance by Dee Wallace who gets to shout lines like ""EAT YOUR DINNER!"" and ""I was always going to eat YOU!"" seals the deal. A must watch for slasher fans. I can't wait to dig in for seconds.",1359504000,13,2264,4.453012048192771
