1085165,5,6305849579,"I've had this movie stolen from me three times. It's better than Life is Beautiful! It's amazing. Without giving away too much of the story, I will say, pay attention to the words of Schlomo the village idiot. His monologues are profound. Pay attention to the transformation of the ""Nazis"" who struggle not to become their uniform, and I promise you the last 30 seconds of the film will take your breath away.

An amazing movie that has not gotten nearly enough attention in the United States. This movie deserves a full run. It may be overlooked but it can never be anything less than what it is; one of the best movies ever made.",1114646400,8,631,4.48695652173913
1085166,5,6305849579,"I wholeheartedly second the review by 'Mt. Healthy Mountaineer ""intrepid reviewer""' but would like to note that he has the geographical details all mixed up: the film DOES concern the fate of a little Jewish village as the Nazis approach, but the village is NOT in France. There have never been any little Jewish villages in France. This village is quite clearly set in  Eastern Europe (Poland, Romania, Lithuania...), where such villages were actually to be found. I'm guessing Romania, because the director (and writer, if I remember correctly) of this film is himself a Romanian. And for all the elements of farce in this film, it has about it the unmistakable LOOK of authenticity.

  What made the previous reviewer think that this film was set in France? Simple: it happens to be a French-LANGUAGE film (with English subtitles, of course), and its actual title is ""Train de Vie"".

  So now the story line begins to make sense: News reaches the little Jewish village in Romania that the Germans are approaching (from the West), and that all the citizens of the neighboring villages have been put on trains and shipped WEST toward Germany...and not one of these Jews has ever been heard from again. In desperation, they hatch a plan to buy an old train, paint it to look like the trains the Nazi's are using, disguise some of themselves as Nazi officers and the rest as their prisoners, and ""deport"" their whole village...no, not West, toward Germany, but EAST, to neighboring Russia, where they believe they'll be free and from which some of them might eventually even head for Palestine.

(Of course, had the village really been in France, then heading East would have taken them right to...Germany.)",1114214400,6,1706,4.8788927335640135
1085167,5,6305849579,"This is a World War II Jewish Holucaust comedy, if you can believe it. It is in French w/subtitles and it concerns a little Jewish village that knows the Nazis are coming to deport their village. Everyone is panic-stricken until the village idiot has a brilliant idea - the village should get a train and ""deport"" themselves all of the way to Palestine. The movie is all about their purchase of a dilapidated old train, its refurbishment into a Nazi-style train and their escape across Europe and the chase by the Nazis.

Along the way, there are all kinds of humorous encounters with Nazis, the French Resistance, Gypsies and Communists. Parts of it are ""Keystone cops"" and parts of it are ""Monty Python-esque"".

I will not tell you how it ends, because the ending packs a powerful emotional punch. However, I do whole-heartedly recommend the movie.",1091836800,8,850,4.815068493150685
1085168,4,6305849579,"The comparison to Life is Beautiful is inevitable.  The only similarity that I can see is that both are a comedy that encompasses the biggest horror in humanity: the Holocaust.  Whereas La Vita e Bella is a one-man show, this is a story about a community that has to deal with the crisis in their own unique way.
When the Germans are approaching the little Jewish village in France, the village votes to purchase a train, a German train rather, and a group of the villagers would pretend to be German soldiers accosting the condemned Jews to the concentration camp.  On their way to Russia and safety, one thing after another goes bad, there is the dissension in the rank by the ""Communist Jews"", there are a French soldiers who really think that the train is a real German train and try to bomb it to save the Jews.  Then they meet up with real German soldiers and the adventure continues.  Whether they make it or not, you would have to watch it yourself, I won't ruin your ending.
The comedy is rather heavy-handed, along with the amusing adventure, you learn about the passengers, their hopes and dreams.  At times it almost falls into drama while quickly making a retreat back to the comedic genre.  A light-hearted comedy this is not, at every misadventure they come to, as an audience, your heart jumps along.  You wonder if they will make it past this obstacle.  You predict that they will, since it is a comedy after all, then again you probably remember how Life is Beautiful ends.  Can you really make a pure comedy out of such tragedy?
This is the aspect that keeps the movie rolling.  The anticipation of what is going to happen next.  The movie contains enough moments to keep you laughing.  However, it is during the moments when nothing happens and the passengers deal with their own issues, that the movie gets interesting.",1005696000,9,1840,4.607361963190184
1085169,4,6305849579,"Better than average film is about a town of Jewish people who decide to deport themselves,by train, to avoid the Nazis. This of course means some of the townspeople must masquerade as Nazi solidiers. Passengers on the  train even complain(because of the crowdedness) that they would be treated  better by the real Nazis! Humerous and Insightful, this is a great film  that adds some realism at the end.",964310400,3,402,4.882352941176471
1085170,5,6305849579,"This movie is, and is destined to remain one of my all time favorites. To be able to tell so moving a story in so light a vein is what is needed to get a large audience.",959040000,4,169,3.5945945945945947

1085212,2,6305849579,Too comical considering people lost their lives during the holocaust. I don't think movies should present the holocaust any other way than what the people truly experienced. There is nothing comical about the holocaust.,1406246400,,219,5.470588235294118
1085213,5,6305849579,"This is a truly different Holocaust movie.  It is the most moving I have ever seen.  It is a totally different perspective on the life of a Jewish prisoner.  You must watch to the very end to get the true meaning from the movie.  It is worth watch over again, as you will then get more out of the movie.  I do not want to say too much to spoil the impact, which I found more intense than some documentaries.",1398902400,,407,4.0375
1085214,5,6305849579,I remember when this movie came out in IFC over a decade ago and I've recorded in a VHS tape! lol. I've shown this to my fiance and he said that it's funny too!,1395273600,,160,3.735294117647059
1085215,5,6305849579,"It's a real 'tour de force' to make a so unique comedy with a so tragical subject. Somewhere between the tenderness of 'Life is beautyful', the rythm of Buster Keaton and the imagination of Chaplin. Where are the critics?",1394323200,,221,4.6923076923076925
1085216,4,6305849579,As others have said the technical merits are not high. The subtitles are fixed and full of mistakes and the picture quality is not really good DVD quality let alone Blu-ray. The price is also rather high. Despite all this I found this a hilarious escapade. There was little to laugh about in the Holocaust and this romp manages to treat it with respect whilst producing plenty to amuse. Made mostly in Rumania despite being in French it has a lot of dash. Try to see it.,1393632000,,470,4.413793103448276
1085217,4,6305849579,"This is a superb film--Definitely five stars for the film itself.  I have been showing the VHS version to my students (college level) for years and students always love it as much as I do. I was very excited to get this on DVD, but was disappointed with the number of typos in the subtitles. Subtitles can have mistakes at times, but these were clearly simply typos that hadn't been caught. it's a shame that more care didn't go into creating the DVD of such an excellent film. That's why I gave the DVD only four stars.",1367452800,,520,4.360824742268041

1085219,2,6305849579,"This review is not about the movie (which certainly deserves 5 stars), but about the region 1 DVD issued by Olive Films: the DVD comes with English subtitles which are overlaying the image and cannot be switched off, and the picture quality is worse than - for example - the German region 2 DVD of Sunfilm (blurred image). Compared with the Sunfilm DVD, the Olive Film version has only two advantages: the widescreen format (the Sunfilm version is cropped on both sides and has an aspect ratio of 1:1,33), and it is complete (in the Sunfilm version some scenes were censored and cut out due to the age restriction of 6 years).",1360108800,6,626,4.598214285714286
1085220,4,6305849579,"The story line, acting and authenticity of surroundings, clothing and Yiddish propriety and music are excellent. The story is humorus on a subject that really isn't and it is all very well done.

The negative side is the lack of access to this video for American or region 1 players. I have yet to locate a DVD that is playable on region 1, outside of French with English subtitles and French does not sound at all correct for a Romanian yiddish community.  It would be much better make this DVD available in English or better yidddish with English subtitles. Every synagogue should have this DVD.  The version I have is German but for European or region 2 and I have been unable to find anyone to convert it, although a freind has been able to download it with region free software for me.",1335484800,2,790,4.510489510489511

1085242,1,6305849579,"hola a todos: me decidi comprar la pelicula por que es una obra maestra,pero le di solo una estrella por el motivo que el estuche y las opciones en el dvd son peor que una pelicula PIRATA,o tal vez esta es una pelicula PIRATA no se.
1- la caja no se entienden las letras una MUY MALA FOTOCOPIA.
2- el dvd no viene con SET UP lo cual tienes una pelicula hablada en frances y no te da la opcion de oirla en espanol o ingles.
no tiene opcion te titulos.
3- la imagen es casi igual que si la ves en el youtube,con la diferencia que en el youtube esta doblada al espanol y es fabulosamente interpretada.
4- la verdad que es una buena pelicula,pero yo no le vuelvo a comprar ni un solo dvd a DISCO VIVEROS que es la compania que la tiene en venta creo que es mejor comprarla en otra distribuidora luego que la encuentre se las voy a poner para que la compren de mejor calidad y con set up.",1316649600,,883,4.0227272727272725
1085243,4,6305849579,"This video is a comedic look at life in the 1940's Europe during the holocaust-we must not forget the seriousness of this time but to watch the movie for it's comedic value.  This is all done in French but unfortunately the version I bought was subtitled in Spainish which I could not understand. I had recently seen this DVD with English sub titles.  Perhaps when that version becomes available at a reasonable cost I will be able to own it. If you can keep focused on the seriousness of the holocaust, than you will be able to laugh at this movie. I do not recommend it for children especially those who do not understand the holocaust for this will definitely confuse them. also you don't need to understand yiddish-the words are easy to figure out. also I thank Amazon.com for making the purchase and return of DVD's as easy and uncomplicated as it was.",1301356800,2,857,4.558441558441558

1085245,5,6305849579,"I'm astonished that this movie has not yet reached America's shores. I have never seen a movie that so effectively celebrates the miracle and love that was Shetl life amidst so many obstacles. And yet it tells a story with great warmth and humor that never for a moment pretends to ignore the horror. How is that possible? It left me with renewed joy and love for my people, my heritage, my culture, right along with the pangs of loss from the Holocaust.

I hope Amazon lets me post these You-tube links, but if you'll check them out, you just might fall in love with this movie as much as I have.

In one scene (the first link, below, or search You-tube for ""Music duel: Jewish klezmer vs Gipsy music - Train de vie"" if you can't), Jews and gypsies have a first encounter in which their different forms of music pull them together into a joyous synthesis of the two.

Enjoy!

1085246,5,6305849579,"I first saw this movie 8 years ago when it was released in America.  I has been my favorite film ever since.  I watch it every year.  The themativ development is the best I have ever seen.  The quality of the themes and the variety of themes explored within the film is greater than in any other movie I have seen.  The juxtaposition of pain and joy, fear and humor is done masterfully.

1085247,2,6305849579,"I read the reviews on this movie here and elsewhere before watching it, and I want to make a few qualifications to the generally glowing report.  While I agree that the film is at times delightfully amusing and often philosophically humorous, I found the ending far more than simply ""surprising,"" as many reviewers have reported it.  There is an almost sadistic quality to the ""surprise"" for which I was not prepared and wished fervently that I had been.  Train de Vie has been compared repeatedly with Life is Beautiful, and while components of the two films certainly correspond, the feel and philosophical message of each film differs greatly.  The movie has many good elements, but as an emotionally engaged viewer, I found the ending betraying.",1168819200,6,749,4.968

1085249,5,6305849579,"without being biased (since I'm Romanian) I have to admit that the movie is simply great! the comic part just wants to shift the accent from the extremely sad situation to a rather pleasent occuring... all the twists and turns give the movie its capability to keep you seated until you see what happened to them. like many other European movies it is a greatly phylosophical movie as well and it is far from the ordinary comercial movies that bring in the money for box offices.

7896962,4,6305849579,"I loved the movie the first time I saw in the late 1990s. The second time through, it wasn't quite as fantastic as I had remembered it, but despite the stereotypes and slapstick moments, it's a great dream of a movie. Certainly better than ""Life is Beautiful"" which (unfortunately) knocked this film out of theater exposure, and far superior than the American re-make of ""Jacob The Liar"". (However, if you have an opportunity to see ""Jakob"" in its original German version, don't miss it. Far surpasses all the films noted above.)

As far as the language goes, it's a French film, so it's in French. Would people make the same complaints if the film was from an American studio and was in English? I've never heard complaints that ""Life is Beautiful"", ""Jacob the Liar"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""Yenta"" or any other of dozens of ethnic Jewish films weren't originally made in Yiddish or a central European language.",1518393600,,912,4.772151898734177
