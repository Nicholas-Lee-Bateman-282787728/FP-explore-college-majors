Read my review by googling,""9.99 Pegasus News.""",1267315200,2,84,5.461538461538462
6062043,5,B00G79UH4M,"$9.99 is a gorgeous film with amazing stop-motion animation and a thought-provoking story. Actually, multiple stories that wind together and apart and together again. You'll be talking about this film long after the credits roll. It's an experience worth considerably more than $9.99.",1266883200,6,284,5.627906976744186

8621181,1,B00G79UH4M,"One of the worst stop motion animations I've ever seen. Poorly written, idiotic circumstances, pointless outcome. I've had this movie a while and just now decided to watch it. Just terrible. Get Mary & Max instead. This one is easily forgettable and annoyingly slow to amount to nothing.",1503705600,,287,5.0
8621182,4,B00G79UH4M,"This is one of those curious movies you find every once in a while and you are very glad you found it. It's very light hearted. It leaves you thinking about how your words and actions affect those around you. I know not everyone will be a fan, but I highly recommend it.",1483574400,,270,4.113207547169812
8621183,4,B00G79UH4M,"A delightfully quirky and dark stop motion film that is worth a purchase.  It's not of the same caliber as Mary and Max but I would still recommend $9.99 to anyone who appreciates a good, dark, independent film.  One criticism would be that the characters were thinly developed and lacked anything more substantial than an anecdotal glimpse into portions of their lives.  No spoilers here, just give it a try.",1456099200,,409,4.814285714285714

8621187,3,B00G79UH4M,"An Israeli-Australian animation depicts a hopeless ""egalitarian"" reality for short of well-hilled mates as sex-obsessed lacking of any spirituality lives of different characters were screened.

8621188,3,B00G79UH4M,"Um, it's okay....

I've watched this movie three times, and I still can't fully get into it. I loved the over all idea that every person's personallity will lead them down different paths, even people with similar lives. For example, one man refused to give up his beer and drugs for the woman he loved, yet another man turned himself into furniture for his girl. Also, there was no judgement concerning certain characters who had chossen less then desirable life paths. More often then not films will point out the good people from the bad. By doing this, the audience knows who to cheer/boo for. However, in this film it's up to the audience to judge, yet you really don't judge... It's hard to explain.

I think one reason I didn't love this film was due to the lack of physical expressions of the characters. Everything was made very nicely, but I felt that the physical ques were lacking something...not enough body/ facial expressions to suck the audience in. However, the characters were still interesting enough.

So if you want a refreshing story, yet it's a little blah, then you'll enjoy this film.

If you enjoy films similar to this, then buy ""Mary and Max"" (another stop frame animation film).",1295654400,7,1207,4.733333333333333
8621189,3,B00G79UH4M,"Well, for one thing, it was beautifully put together. The sets came across as thoroughly convincing - they gave everything needed for suspension of disbelief. The claymation puppets, too, are some of the most expressive I've seen, among those that stay somewhat close to reality. (I found the skin tones unsettling, though, about like what I enjoy least in some of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Egon-Schiele-s/dp/0500511160/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Egon Schiele's</a>&nbsp;watercolors.)

The plot? Well, it wandered: the lonely old guy who'd chat up a telemarketer just to hear a human voice, the earnest little boy, the repo man, and (of course) the angel. The interactions all stay way in the low-key range - action lovers won't find much here, except maybe the wry humor at someone being a repeat offender at successful suicide.

I don't have any easy words for this flick. When the mood strikes, though, I'm sure I'll come back to it again.
