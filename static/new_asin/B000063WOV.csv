1696093,5,B000063WOV,"When my 20 month old baby boy first saw this movie he was in the childrens hospital for 8 days undergoing a lot of different medical tests.  The hospital had a TV chanel set to play this movie continously. So at anytime the kids could tune in day or night. The hospital used it as a tool to help sooth the children, to make them feel comfortable in such an uncomfortable place. Our visitors were amazed because every time they came to visit my baby was watching the movie, and not bored with it at all. The music is awsome, and very soothing, almost like a beautiful music box. Each scene is so colorful, and playful. I don't know how many times he watched this movie in the hospital, but he was entertained everytime. He laughs, he smiles, he says ""WOW"" through the whole show, he just glowed because it made him so happy, but yet calm. And yes he loved the duck! A cute little puppet that shows up every few minutes to complete the task of making his bed so he could get some sleep. My little boy looked forward to seeing the duck again and again, which  helped him stay interested in the movie.

This is a great movie, and a great tool to have handy when your child needs some real relaxing quite time.

BUY IT!!!",1092528000,5,1216,4.273913043478261
1696094,5,B000063WOV,"Every new parent should own this video.  My son started watching it at 2 months old and he still loves it!  We have the accompanying CD in the car which is a lifesaver as well.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a ""calm baby"".",1092528000,,244,4.148936170212766
1696095,5,B000063WOV,this video is incredible.  when my son was 2mnths he was a very gassy and irritable baby.  my mom bought this video in hope it would help calm him.  and it did and still does he is now almost 7mnths old.  when he gets overly tired and restless we put the video on and he immediatley calms down.,1059955200,4,294,4.017241379310345
1696096,5,B000063WOV,"I bought this video for my daughter when she was 3 month old, and I have played it whenever she was upset, fussy or did not want to go to sleep at bedtime.  I am very happy to say I've had 100% success with it!  Everytime I've played it for her, she has calmed down and fallen asleep before the video is over!  The music, vocals, water sound and images all work together to make a wonderfully relaxing experience.  I not only works for baby - it works for mommy too!!  It is a must for every parent or care-giver, and a sweet way to help baby to sleep!",1050537600,5,552,4.027522935779817
1696097,5,B000063WOV,"This movie is so calming to children, the sound captivates them. I have seen so many children calm down after being very upset. As a babysitter, it has saved my life more times. When the kid gets fussy, I pop in Calm Baby and they are relaxed, it is wonderful.  The kids seem to enjoy the soothing sounds of water along with the images that are being presented. This is one MUST HAVE for any parent, babysitter, or educator.",1031702400,5,424,4.367088607594937
1696098,5,B000063WOV,My sister-in-law raved about Calm Baby after I gave it to her as a baby shower gift. She says it's the one thing her daughter won't outgrow in a few months.  It'll be my regular gift for baby showers to come!,1029283200,4,208,4.073170731707317
1696099,5,B000063WOV,"Calm Baby really does soothe and captivate my child.  As an infant, my son enjoyed the familiarity with the sights and sounds he was hearing.  Now as a toddler, he loves to sing and follow along with the beautiful images and music.",1021420800,6,231,4.476190476190476
1696120,5,B000063WOV,"It is an excellent video.  4 month old baby loves the bright colors , soothing water sounds, and classical music.  Mellows her down and gives parents 1/2 hour to get something done.",1358467200,,181,4.625
1696121,3,B000063WOV,"My son is OBSESSED with Baby Einstein, but I was really sick of watching those so I tried to branch out. My son (9 months old) DID enjoy this video and likes watching it. It does look cheap, but so do the Baby Einstein's, it looks about the same picture quality/production wise. I personally would never make watching a DVD part of my child's bedtime routine (that's a little strange in my opinion...) but it is a nice, calming effect.",1342828800,,435,4.45
1696122,5,B000063WOV,"This DVD/CD combo was the best shower gift! Unfortunately, when I first previewed it I was disappointed in the imagery. Yes, it looks like you or I could have filmed it. However, a few months later when my son would not stop crying for anything I played it in hopes of anything to make him relax. within moments he was relaxing. ABSOLUTELY amazing and wonderful for he and I.

While the DVD does not have the advanced imagery of other brands, I think it is simple enough that our babies can grasp it without being over stimulated!!! my husband and I had to remind ourselves that its not for us, its for baby. And our baby boy has chosen this one as his favorite.  If I turn it on and he is out of the room he will come barreling down the hall. Its so funny.  My son also does pt and ot exercises everyday. When he gets overly frustrated or refuses to participate the dvd or cd will relax him enough to do his exercises. This DVD is a must have in our house and anywhere we go.",1295913600,,976,4.1534391534391535
1696123,5,B000063WOV,"My daughter is now 5-years-old, but I am currently looking for products again because my brother and his wife are expecting their first child in March.  This was the first ""baby"" video that we bought for our daughter after she was born.  We got it before we really knew anything about Baby Einstein.  Just to see what would happen, we put it in probably a month or so after she was born--and she loved it.  I'm not even sure she could see it clearly yet, but she was entranced.  We eventually did buy many Baby Einstein DVDs, which she also loved.  However, this one seemed to have a different effect on her.  This video was always reliable when she was fussy and especially during the up-all-nighters when she was sick and miserable (along with her parents), especially during her first two years.  The music is especially calming, but the music by itself is not quite as effective as it is when paired with the visual show.",1291161600,,925,4.530120481927711
1696124,5,B000063WOV,"I had bought Fun Baby for my 3 month old little boy and he loved it so much I ordered Calm Baby.  He enjoys this video just as much.  The live pictures are great, and so much more interesting to him than animation.  The music is very calming and the singing voices are very soothing.  Great video, really happy to have it in the house.",1237248000,,335,4.107692307692307
1696125,5,B000063WOV,"this video is a true life saver. my son got it from nana for christmas (he was 3 months) and i thought he would be way too young, but i was wrong!!!!!!!! he has colic and when i stick this dvd in he calms down right away. he is so engrossed in this movie and 8 out of ten times he falls asleep within 10 mins!!!!!! i would buy 2 of them in case something were to happen to one i would have a back up.",1236211200,,400,3.6627906976744184
1696126,4,B000063WOV,"I bought Calm Baby for my 7-month old daughter who was getting very fussy at bedtime (ear piercing screams). The images/music on Calm Baby are exactly what I hoped for. However, there is a segment with a little duck that is a problem. The duck is preparing for bedtime--it occurs throughout the dvd. My problem with it is that my sleepy daughter will immediately become excited when the duck appears because it is very different from the rest of the dvd which is mostly nature/soft images. In addition, she is jerked out of sleep by the rat-a-tat-tat drum sound that accompanies the duck. The duck is really cute but he wakes up my daughter every time. The rest of the dvd is perfect to lull the little one to sleep. If I could edit out the duck, it is just what I wanted and I would highly recommend it.",1234224000,2,804,4.402684563758389
1696127,5,B000063WOV,"I love the calm baby Dvd/cd. My sister stumbled upon it several years ago when her infant daughter wouldn't sleep and it worked like a charm!! We bought one for our first granddaughter and we like to give it as gifts to new parents. We also have a copy here for when the kids visit. If you have babies, this should be in your collection.",1231977600,,337,4.2
1696128,5,B000063WOV,"can't say enough good things about this dvd. my more fussy twin will instintly quite down as soon as it starts and this has been since she was 2 months. it really is a piece of mind to know that when all else fails, i can put on the dvd and she will be a ""calm baby""",1194220800,,266,3.6842105263157894
1696129,5,B000063WOV,"I found this video indispensable when it came to a fussy baby.  We used this video several times for that fussy transition period in the evening following play time with Dada after work and heading into time for sleep.  It helped my son to wind down and relax instead of just screaming because he was over-tired.  But mostly, I found this DVD the best thing for those times in the middle of the night when my son just wouldn't go back to sleep and literally nothing else worked.  We would watch this video and sometimes both fall asleep, then I could put him back to bed relaxed.  I'm happy to say my toddler has never slept in our bed, which is fine by both me and my husband!",1182643200,,677,4.2578125
1696130,5,B000063WOV,"My son is five now and I originally recevied a used VHS from another satisfied parent with a glowing recommendation.  I am now buying the DVD to replace my worn out VHS copy for all the little ones that are frequently in my home.  This video does exactly as advertised it calms baby down and puts often puts them to sleep. While Baby Einstein does that for me it doesn't do it for an infant and isn't supposed to. Baby Einstein keeps them awake and engages their interest, not a calming influence.  For excellent baby and toddler learning videos I recommend Babyscapes over Baby Einstein.  For language learning I recommend Signing Times videos over everything.  They say the word, show the picture, say the word, show the hand sign then say the word again.  But if you want to calm you child down and have them sleep this is the Video to use.",1176422400,,843,4.477124183006536
1696131,4,B000063WOV,"Very similar to the Baby Einstein videos.  We use it occasionally during the ""witching hour"" before bedtime.  Calms everyone down.  Worth the money.",1176163200,,148,5.3478260869565215
1696132,5,B000063WOV,"Calm Baby has been a life saver!!  My daughter would watch this movie over and over...if we would let her.  She has liked it since she was a baby and still likes it.  The water and bright colors captivate her attention and keeps her interested until the end. We have also purchased other ""learning"" movies and they don't even compare to Calm Baby.  It is truly our best investment and I would suggest it to everyone!!",1158710400,2,417,4.447368421052632
1696133,5,B000063WOV,"I have triplet sons and this video is my ""in case of emergency"" if they are all fussy.  For whatever reason, as soon as they see/hear this video, the instantly calm down and are just captivated.  They will watch it over and over and are equally as mesmorized each time.  We also have the Baby Einstein videos that they don't pay attention to hardly at all.  This one just really calms and quiets them.  This has been a life saver for us when we can't do anything else to make them happy!",1144713600,5,487,4.25
1696134,3,B000063WOV,"This was an okay video.  My son liked it, and the music was calming.  I liked that it came with a music CD in addition to the DVD.  I could definitely tell it wasn't quite up to the quality of Baby Einstein.  It seemed like someone just took cute toys and filmed them in front of a pretty pool.  I would say stick with the Baby Einstein series.  They are a little more creative and better quality.",1127692800,4,397,4.090909090909091
1696135,5,B000063WOV,"this is the best dvd...  everyone i know who has used this raves over it.. it captures the little one's attention and they watch it over and over!! great for ""fussy time""!!!!",1124150400,3,174,4.4375
1696136,5,B000063WOV,"I got this as a ""suggested"" video in combination with another ""baby-show"" that my sister had recommended that I get for my 2 year old.  At the time my 5 month old son enjoyed crying more than just about anything else in the world.  My husband put the ""calm baby"" video in hopes that we could eat dinner without holding my son on my lap.  It was unbelievable. He was entranced from the first moment.  We thought it might just be a fluke, but it worked everytime.  We have a couple of Baby Einsteins, but this is by far the favorite.  He is now 2 and my daughteris 3 and they both (on occasion) still ask for the ""baby show"" over the Wiggles or Elmo.",1122508800,6,648,4.144
1696137,5,B000063WOV,"I don't know what it is about this video that is so wonderful, but why question a good thing?  I also have several of the Baby Einstein videos and they haven't really held my son's attention.  I assumed that my son at 5 months old is probably just too young for videos.  Then a friend recommended the Calm Baby video.  She has encorporated it into her children's bedtime routine and absoluetly raves about it.  So, I skeptically, gave it a try.

When I first put the dvd on, I thought it was another Baby Mozart carbon copy.  Both Baby Mozart and Calm Baby use music, puppets, toys and nature scenes to create a soothing effect - I can't tell the difference between the two videos.  But for some reason, my son can.  We put the video in right during his ""fussy time"" before bed.  He was immediately enthralled and instantly became a ""calm baby"".  He watched the whole video (around 30 min) and then settled right down to sleep.  We've now achieved the same effect every night for the last couple of weeks.

For those of you who are not familiar with the premise of the video, Calm Baby uses puppets, nature scenes, and occasional toys set to soothing music (some classical, some lullabys).  The video has a water theme (just like Baby Einstein's Baby Neptune - but for us, Baby Neptune doesn't seem to work, while this does).  Throughout the video, the puppets go about their bedtime routine - putting pillows on the bed, getting the teddy bear ready, etc until the end of the video they are all fast asleep.  I like that the video reinforces bedtime as it soothes baby.  I also like that fewer toys are used in this video compared to Baby Einstein... Sometimes Baby Einstein videos seem to me like one long advertisement for their products. The DVD also comes with an audio CD which I keep in the car now for ""calm baby"" moments during traffic.

I wish I knew why this works so well, but I'm certainly going to enjoy it while it lasts.",1105315200,15,1936,4.451704545454546
1696138,5,B000063WOV,"Sisters-in-law made this video of soothing sights and sounds of water with nursery songs and classical music after realizing how effective it was with their children.  One is the parent to triplets.  Included with the video is an audio cd with twenty-three tracks covering thirty-four minutes of lullabies, nursery songs and classical music.

My seven-year old son thought the music was lovely and several times commented on the cute toys profiled in Calm Baby with the only negative being he got dizzy at one of the first images of some spinning and twirling of lights.

Throughout the Calm Baby video are images of stuffed and rubber animals in various water arrangements. The rubber duckie is one of them plus a stuffed duck that has a continuing story in a few segments. The duck is like a puppet and he pushes a small purple bed, this is similar to a dollhouse item. Before the duck shows up again the screen has a white background with blue coloring at the bottom similar to waves floating around and some classical music accompanying the image.

There is no speaking in the Calm Baby video, only the vocals to four songs I believe, Rain Rain Go Away, Itsy Bitsy Spider, Row Row Row Your Boat and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. For the Rain song there were a few kids shown from the back looking and touching a window while it was raining outside. The boat song showed toys that a child would play in the tub with and there was a twinkling show with an array of lights and colors for the star song.

The spider song showed a green and then blue spider that was like a stuffed animal but moved by a string going up and down in a room. Some of the other toys or images shown were the kind of toys that are attached to a mobile over a crib. One was a pretty red, white and black animal that my son just adored.

The images are of bubbles, water fountains, rain dropping on roses, umbrellas opening and twirling to the rain. The umbrella sequence moved perfectly to the music and then a few times there were the colored balls that you see in ball pits, but they were in a two- tiered fountain and the music and rain drops moved in rhythm perfectly.

There is one scene with a giant clam opening up with bubbles coming out and others showing the rocks and toys in aquariums. A child's hand is seen placing stuffed fish inside an aquarium that was handmade with colorful material. Thirty minutes of these arrangements goes by fairly quickly and quite possibly puts a smaller infant or toddler to sleep with the calming effects of the images and nursery songs.

 I can attest to this being well suited for my children and those who enjoy visual images that are vibrant, as well as hearing rain droplets hitting the pavement. We enjoyed watching sunflowers and roses as the rain dropped on them and the colorful twirling of the umbrella.

This is a very relaxing and soothing video that could be played for children while parent is taking care of chores and before nap or bedtime. Older children will like to watch the various images that go by and remark on the colors and sounds and possibly sing along with the nursery songs.

Both my children are on the Autism Spectrum and liked Calm Baby at various times.",1099267200,5,3207,4.51986183074266
1696139,4,B000063WOV,"My 6 month old nephew was first introduced to this video when he was only a month old. It held his attention for the most part and so I concluded it was a good buy. But the other night when all attempts to put him to sleep failed my sister put on the cd that is included with the movie and he fell right to sleep. Nothing else has really been able to put him to sleep like that. Any video that puts a baby to sleep when the whole house is as tired and cranky as he is, get's two thumbs up from me.

update: At ten months old he still goes to sleep with this cd.",1092873600,6,561,3.7542372881355934

He had lung surgery and the hospital happened to have this as an on demand type of option on their tv's and he watched it soooo many times during his hospital stay, but he loved it.

7959945,5,B000063WOV,"My mom bought this for my infant son.  I love that it has both visual and audio options.  When he was a newborn, I could turn the classical music section on without any visual.  Once he got a bit older, we introduced the visual portion and he just loves it!  Everything is very simple--waterfalls, puppets, flowers,,etc, but it really holds his attention.  I also have a few Baby Einstein DVDs and here is why I like Calm Baby better:  when you have a fussy baby and know that the video will calm them, the Calm Baby DVD is playing within a minute after turning it on.  With Baby Einstein, it takes ages to get to the actual video portion!  The content is the same concept, so go for the less commercialized of the two options.",1418601600,,727,4.333333333333333
