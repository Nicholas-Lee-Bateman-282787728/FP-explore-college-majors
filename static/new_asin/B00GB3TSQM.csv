The range of people interviewed, the accuracy, the depth of detail and the whimsical romance of flying were all captured.

6069857,5,B00GB3TSQM,"This award-winning film tells the story of 20 women who were pioneers of aviation and who tirelessly pursued their dreams to fly in the National Air Derby. They accomplished this goal in 1929. Few people can name any other woman pilot other than Amelia Earhart, but by the end of this film, you will know 19 other women who were Earhart's peers. It is a compelling story of camaraderie competition, and intrigue. I was honored to see the premiere of this film in a small theater with about 100 women pilots who had just finished flying 2100+ miles in the annual Air Race Classic and with family members of 4 pilots in the 1st Women's National Air Derby.  The film was also shown at a regional film festival that I encouraged some of my fellow pilots to attend, and a founding member of our EAA (aviation) chapter and his wife commented afterwards that it was the best film that they had seen in a very long time. Great story telling. Great film footage and cinematography, both old and new.",1383523200,5,990,4.5307262569832405
6069858,5,B00GB3TSQM,This documentary will touch your heart and ignite the dream of flight in all who watch it. You will feel as if you are right alongside these inspirational women on their amazing journey through the sky. A++++,1383523200,7,208,4.648648648648648
6069859,5,B00GB3TSQM,"This is an amazing film. Producer Heather Taylor has done yeomans work in documenting the 1929 Air Derby race  not just the race, but, more importantly, the lives of the participating women who are each history-makers themselves. The story is compelling not only to aviation enthusiasts but to historians and anyone who enjoys a well-told tale of American history. While the story is fascinating, the cinematography and restored footage bring it to life and the interviews bring the personal stories home. You'll want to sit through this wonderful documentary time and time again.",1383523200,2,580,5.236559139784946
6069860,5,B00GB3TSQM,"Vintage footage with reminisces by some of the women who flew in the first women's national air derby and their families made this a fascinating film. I bought it for research for a book that I'm writing, but I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the early days of flight. Bravo to these brave women!",1397692800,2,314,4.431034482758621
6069861,5,B00GB3TSQM,"I can't say enough about this documentary. As a pilot and documentary buff, I was thoroughly impressed by the film. It was recommended to me by a friend who had been to a screening of the film. This is the only place I could find it other than the website of the film itself. I have to say I am very satisfied with my purchase. It is full of incredible stories and information from beginning to end. There is no filler to waste your time in this documentary.

I was previously unaware of the First Women's National Air Derby (aka the powder puff derby) until viewing this film. I am so shocked that such an awe-inspiring story has fallen through the cracks of modern history. The most recognizable name is Amelia Earhart, but she is just one of many pioneering women that helped make aviation more accessible to the general population by inspiring people to follow in their footsteps. The aviation world owes a lot to these women, and I for one am glad this story is finally getting told.",1397606400,3,988,4.488888888888889

6069865,5,B00GB3TSQM,"""Breaking Through the Clouds"" is a perfect film for all ages. It will inspire viewers to accept challenges and overcome obstacles.  The women racers triumphed over all stereotypes and doubters. A beautiful blending of archival film, current interviews and contemporary flying footage.

6069866,5,B00GB3TSQM,"This film by Heather Taylor is the best documentary I have seen by far!  Heather has a way of transporting you back in time, really giving you a sense of what it was like for these women as they tackled this challenge.  The original footage is incredible and so well blended with the rest of the film.  These women were amazing, way ahead of their time, and truly inspirational for all of us.  I found myself wrapped up in each pilot's individual story and rooting for each one.  This film was enjoyable on so many levels.  As someone with no background in aviation, I was fascinated to learn so many new things about flying and being a female pilot during that era.  This film is a must watch!!!!",1387324800,2,697,4.3984375
6069867,5,B00GB3TSQM,"I have had the opportunity to see many times this visually engaging and a beautifully filmed DVD of many unsung women pioneers in aviation.  Each time I have seen it, I see new details and gain a greater understanding of each of the women and their unique personalities , but who shared a passion for flying. Their commitment and support of other women flying at the time was also critical when there were many barriers for each of them.
This inspiring film is appropriate for students and adults who want to learn more about these women in history, The First National Women's Air Derby.  Perhaps more important,  we get to observe a group of women with a shared passion and sense of community and support for others, and how they helped shape the future for other women and girls....and our world!!!

6069868,5,B00GB3TSQM,"Truly a labor of love, Heather Taylor's ""Breaking Through the Clouds: The First Women's National Air Derby"" is first rate and I most highly recommend that every woman pilot out there take the time to watch it. The historic film clips from the Derby that are included are just charming! The 20 women who flew the Derby all had such fascinating personalities and captivating stories. One of the most inspiring messages that comes to light in this documentary is that even though the Derby was a competition, the women understood the importance of banding together, which was especially effective when there was a safety issue. These 20 women pilots were tenacious and all were great examples of women who unabashedly pursued their ambitions and goals. Heather Taylor has created a work that I think would be highly motivational to women everywhere!

6069869,5,B00GB3TSQM,"Without a doubt, one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It is gorgeous, compelling and inspirational. If you are not a pilot, you will learn so much of the history of aviation, of women in aviation especially. If you ARE a pilot, you will still learn much, as I did. I was overwhelmed by the skills of the women in this race, as well as their bravery and class. The camaraderie of the women warmed my heart and made me wish I could have been a part of the Golden Age of Aviation. Producer Heather Taylor has put together a well researched and entertaining film that will hold your interest til the very end and will appeal to all ages. I highly recommend it for you, your friend the aviation buff, for your niece or daughter that needs to know what women were capable of then and now.
