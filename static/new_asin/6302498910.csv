7826650,5,6302498910,"This is one great action movie, it features a good script, the movie has a very good pace, and even though it is a fictional story, it is a very interesting way of bringing the World's problems into Mexico's very own's... Germans, Italians and Japanese planning to reach the US through Mexico, they just didn't count with one person, the Bandido Lupe Padilla!",1198627200,,359,4.714285714285714
7826651,3,6302498910,"Fernandez's camera shows the influence of Eisenstein, and his storyline certainly follows like an early Hitchcock film.  Soy Puro Mexicano, as the sort of silly title might lead on, plays like a loose Mexican version of The Lady Vanishes.  It has German and Japanese spies, a train ride, a foxy dame, a hacienda holdup, Western styled shootouts, and even a prison escape.  It's never quite serious or smoothly produced, but that gives it some of its charm.  I think what I like best about Soy Puro Mexicano is the opening scenes of warfare in Europe and Asia.  For me that is precisely what made the Epoca Dorada so special:  while Europe and Asia were descending into war and barbarism, Mexico was a relatively tranquil island in a sea of turmoil.  So even though Soy Puro Mexicano is nothing to change the world or even take seriously, for me it is THE perfect place to begin an exploration of Mexico's golden age of cinema.

The DVD is barebones and has no English or Spanish subtitles.  Running time is just under 90 minutes.  The image quality is less than great but in no way inhibits a proper enjoyment of the film.  All in all we should just feel lucky to be able to see this at all!",1099008000,5,1191,4.493023255813953
7826652,5,6302498910,"This fabulous classic has everything ! Taking place during World War 2, it has spies, bandits, wonderful music (performed by Pedro Vargas, and more...) a lot of humor, gorgeous cinematography (though a little grainy at times, the beauty of this film makes its age insignificant), and the stunning and exquisitely graceful Raquel Rojas doing a Flamenco number that's one of the lovliest ever captured on film.
Pedro Armendariz is spectacular. His charisma, strength, and comedic timing are absolutely superb. This is a powerful, brilliant performance and one that will stay in your mind long after you've seen it.
The courage, honor, and virtue portrayed in this film make it as uplifting as it is entertaining. If you speak or understand Spanish, don't miss it, and if you're of Mexican heritage, you will be oh so very, very proud. I've never seen anything comparable in feeling for those of us born North of the border, and riding into the sunset never looked, or sounded, so good.",972000000,25,983,4.963636363636364
7826653,5,6302498910,"This film is a ""Classic"", and for Pedro Almendarez fans, it is one not to miss.  The film takes place during the war years (early '40's). It is a mystery, comedy, romance, adventure, and more. Pero mas que nada,  ""da mucho ser Mexicano"".  No se la pierdan.",949881600,14,256,4.404255319148936
