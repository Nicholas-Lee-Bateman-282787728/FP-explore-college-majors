8626163,5,B00GPSM1SK,"A brilliant film made early by the Polonia Brothers. your eyes have never witnessed such heart pounding action as two prehistoric dinosaurs battle each other for the 21ST century in this good/bad at its worst film piece, starring Mark Polonia. Not since death reel and bad magic have you seen something that inspires by such low budget acting and great cheep effects, i mean they really out done themselves with this one. This is a must have for any P.B.E. fan.",1503100800,,461,4.703703703703703
