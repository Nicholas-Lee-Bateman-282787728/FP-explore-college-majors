8058638,5,B0009A40XY,This is a true story and for me was heartbreaking to watch . ! My mother now deceased was one of those patient's and she wouldn't ever talk about her time at the Allen Memorial .  No wonder ... I really regret that I hadn't taken the extra time to ask her more about this .. I was young and didn't realize the significance. !,1396396800,5,325,4.0
8058639,5,B0009A40XY,"Fantastic service! This product got here days before it was anticipated for delivery. The quality was great, 3 hour long DVD and no flaws whatsoever. For any of the myriad of witnesses, government officials, operatives, etc. targeted by the MK-ultra, Monarch, mind-control HAARP torture lobby (RICO psychopath group) this DVD/Movie is a must have. Delves into the early days of (Richard Helmes' CIA)CIA funding of mind-control and torture, taking some of its earliest work outside of the country to Canadian psychiatrist, David Ewan Cameron, and his notorious human experimentation on innocent Canadian citizens inevitably destroying them and their lives. A slightly water-downed portrayal of the origins of the pervasive psychopathy and sadism glutting western psychiatry and clandestine operations regarding torture and human experimentation over the past 60 years in America. Leaves one longing for the days of yore for the good-guy dinosaur trial attorney--for those who used to fight the good fight. A must have for those interested in the history of torture, sadism, human experimentation and the innumerous violations of the Nuremberg Codes.",1324425600,3,1148,5.603448275862069
8058640,5,B0009A40XY,"THIS GREAT MOVIE ""THE SLEEP ROOM"" (1997) IS LIKE ""DAVID AND GOLIATH"" AND EFFECTIVELY IS SPLIT IN TWO HALVES. THE FIRST HALF OF THE MOVIE IS ABOUT THE CANADIAN PYSCHIATRIC PATIENTS WHOM ENDURED EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN TORTURE TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO THEM AT THE ALLEN MEMORIAL INSTITUTE IN CANADA DURING THE 1950'S AND 1960'S IN BREACH OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND IN BREACH OF ""THE NUREMBURG CODE 1947."" THE SECOND HALF OF THE MOVIE IS ABOUT THE AMAZING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE CIA BY LAWYER JOE RAUH AND ASSOCIATES WHERE CONSULTANT DR.EWEN CAMERON WAS FUNDED BY THE CIA AND THE CANADIAN GOVERMENT TO PERFORM ILLEGAL BRAIN TORTURE EXPERIMENTS ON CANADIAN PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS.  DURING THE LEGAL DISCOVERY LAWYERS FOUND THAT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT RECIEVED AN OFFICIAL APOLOGY FROM THE CIA BUT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ACTED UPON THIS AND BLOCKED DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND BARRED TESTIMONY FROM THE CANADIAN GOVT. LAISION TO THE CIA. THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT WENT FURTHER AND USED A FABRICATED ""COOPER REPORT"" AGAINST THE PLAINTIFFS. HOWEVER, THE PLAINTIFFS ACHIEVED SUCCESS FOR PERSEVERING WITH THEIR LEGAL EFFORTS WITH A SETTLEMENT FROM THE CIA. THE CIA SETTLED OUT OF COURT WITH THE PLAINTIFFS AFTER A JUDGEMENT WAS MADE AGAINST THE CIA FOR NEGLIGANT SUPERVISION OF CONSULTANTS WHOM PERFORMED THE ILLEGAL BRAIN TORTURE EXPERIMENTS ON CANADIAN PATIENTS WITHOUT CONSENT.JOE RAUH (DONALD MOFFATT) AND COLLEAGUE JANE CONROY (MARINA ORSINI) SUED THE CIA ON BEHALF OF MANY CANADIAN VICTIMS OF ILLEGAL BRAIN TORTURE EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED AT THE ALLEN MEMORIAL INSTITUTE IN CANADA.",1318118400,5,1568,5.426229508196721
