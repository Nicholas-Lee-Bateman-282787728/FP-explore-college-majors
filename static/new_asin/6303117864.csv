7839343,4,6303117864,"Graham Greene's Philby-inspired double agent Maurice Castle, the very antithesis of 007 or Austin Powers, bicycles to work, decodes Cold War cryptography with a stubby felt marker and leads a generally bourgeois suburban existence with an African wife, her son and passive guard dog Buller. These deliciously mundane spydom realities are very deviously understated by Greene, Otto Preminger and smart scenarist Tom Stoppard, and true to form Preminger, directing his final film at age 74, delivers a rippingly good UK cast. Scotland's Brandoesque bad boy Nicol Williamson plays Castle quietly but spectacularly well, fully attuned to the deadpan Preminger (and Greene) idiom, and the supporting cast has particularly fine turns by Richard Attenborough, Richard Vernon, Robert Morley, Ann Todd and a subdued Derek Jacobi. The exotic model Iman is no actress (cf. Jean Seberg), but Preminger directs her indulgently and very decoratively.

Preminger and Stoppard follow Greene's autumnal 1978 novel closely but introduce discontinuous flashbacks set in Pretoria (cheaply filmed in Kenya) that amplify Castle's curious double allegiance to London and to Moscow, and the semi-traitor's biracial domesticity--spydom's ""human factor""--is an important theme recurring throughout Preminger's career trajectory. Allegiances and motivations shift like quicksand in this complex yet straightforward narrative, and it's interesting that those literary men Greene, Stoppard and Preminger use enciphered editions of Twain, Tolstoy and Trollope (along with stubby felt markers and unanswered landline phones) as the Luddite technologies for Castle's very prosaic yet very serious low-tech spying.

With Ann Todd we've a link to PARADINE CASE, and there are further Hitchcockian allusions to SECRET AGENT (Preminger gives John Gielgud a throwaway cameo in the prologue) and to TOPAZ and TORN CURTAIN, the latter directly recalled in HUMAN FACTOR's botched offcamera disposition of the unfortunate guard dog Buller. Preminger's film also partly recapitulates another lost classic of British cinema spydom, Blake Edwards' neglected TAMARIND SEED--and in each comparative case this sophisticated Preminger valediction has smarter literary values thanks to Greene and Stoppard and mellower cinematic equipose as well.

Greene followers should check out the book, and Preminger completists will find that HUMAN FACTOR neatly salvages the director's tarnished reputation after SKIDOO and ROSEBUD, with this overlooked film quite on par with the late-Preminger insider picks JUNIE MOON or SUCH GOOD FRIENDS. The film is definitely worth owning and rewatching, and I look forward to reading and seeing this narrative again, since the storytelling is devilishly expert and far more intricate than in most of the flashier spydom thrillers. The thrills here are quieter but also deeply unsettling, in the usual Preminger way, and the film is a unique career-closing supplement to the ambiguous BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING.",1468886400,,2989,5.788636363636364
7839344,4,6303117864,"Terrific cast in this effective adaptation of a Graham Greene novel.  Nicol Williamson is especially good.  My only reservation is that there are sudden flashbacks to South Africa, and the transitions leave the viewer wondering, at least momentarily, when and where the action is taking place.",1395964800,3,293,5.3478260869565215
7839345,5,6303117864,"Very low key in many aspects, this film steals into your brain just as surely as a successful spy purloins State secrets. Nicol Williamson's portrait of a spy forced to ""go home"" before his non-secret life can be fulfilled is really never forgotten. And Iman, in her first film role, is admittedly stiff and somewhat two-dimensional, but again, the portrait drawn lingers in a viewer's mind long after the celluloid's finished running. It was Otto Preminger's final film, and rumor has it that many of the cast were never paid; financial problems beset the entire production effort to the point Preminger had to sell some of his art collection to get the film released commercially. Well, he sure did the right thing.",1346284800,2,717,4.885245901639344
7839346,4,6303117864,"I recently watched this film on cable television (I haven't actually seen the video).  Assuming that the version I saw wasn't edited, I wonder why the ""R"" rating?  As to excitement, true, there are no car chases or shootouts (other than the excellent hunting scene at C's country estate), but fans of Graham Greene will find this adaptation very faithful to the novel.  This story is considered by many familiar with the world of espionage to be one of the most accurate and realistic ""spy"" movies ever made.  Greene's subtle but gripping movement towards the inevitable conclusion is characteristic of his best books.
The cast is superb, with the unfortunate exception of Iman as Sarah.  Maybe this was her first role, as she often appears stiff.
Certainly worth watching for readers of G. Greene, perhaps the best English novelist of the 20th century.",990316800,13,853,4.937062937062937
