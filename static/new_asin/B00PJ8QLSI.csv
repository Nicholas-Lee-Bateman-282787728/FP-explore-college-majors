6809033,1,B00PJ8QLSI,If I could give no stars best believe there would be no stars it's a complete waste of time and money don't but it's about a couple of guys running around with the camera and it has no type of anything move doesn't start till almost the very end,1424563200,,245,4.020408163265306
8688250,2,B00PJ8QLSI,"I love finding small independent films especially when they are doing Found Footage style stories, based on a such an interesting modern urban legend as Slender Man.
This film is very amateur to the point where I am sorry to say it, I have seen far better done on YouTube. I honestly cant really recommend this film, but I cant flat out say it absolutely sucked. Lets put it this way, I wouldn't watch it again, but it was interesting to see another's perspective on the lore, as well as film makers have to start somewhere.",1464739200,,524,4.46875
8688251,2,B00PJ8QLSI,Meh. This was just as bad as everyone said it was. SMH.,1464566400,,55,3.6666666666666665
8688252,4,B00PJ8QLSI,"I had a very good time watching this film. It gave me a very 'homey' feel. Reminds me of the days when my friends and I would play around with a camera, filming ourselves and making little movies. In terms of the acting, I felt the actors' performances to be very natural, and believable because of it. Which I feel is something that lacks from even a high-budget, Hollywood movie, yet something that was nailed perfectly here. With the setting of the dark, eerie woods, and these guys that you can really connect with, the tension does build as the film goes on. If you like indie films, and Slender Man, give this movie a shot!",1447545600,,629,4.431034482758621
8688253,1,B00PJ8QLSI,Not worth your time. Worst thing ive ever seen. Disappointing from second number 1,1444608000,,82,4.928571428571429
8688254,1,B00PJ8QLSI,"It's ok, but very slow. Bad acting.",1440979200,,35,4.142857142857143
8688255,1,B00PJ8QLSI,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing. This film is not worth the money, even if it is only $1.99. There is barely a story, the acting is absolutely awful, and the camera moves way too much. I know it is supposedly ""found footage"" but come on. Try a bit harder and have more fun with it. Nice attempt.",1440028800,,312,4.216666666666667
8688256,3,B00PJ8QLSI,For a short movie that a group of kids made it wasn't bad. I thought it was funny at times like when the guy asked 'what about Mike' & the other one answered 'hes a goner' lol. Also I kept seeing Slenderman at times when they didn't even notice him like it was a mistake in the filming. The camera was making a lot of unnecessary noise when different people were holding it. But for a no-budget flick short made by teenagers it wasn't bad lol.,1439769600,,443,4.162790697674419
8688257,3,B00PJ8QLSI,"I'm giving this video three stars not for scares or for thrills or really for even having much of anything related to horror. It's really just four kids on a roadtrip with a video camera, with the only Slenderman appearance at the very end. Normally, Id just give this one star, for those reasons. But, I wanted to give the kids some credit for putting together a no-budget, weekend shoot that kind of reminds me about what the homegrown indie filmmaking experience is all about: a group of friends getting together to at least put together a coherent video, having some fun, and getting their movie to the audience.

As a film, yeah... one star.",1430956800,,646,4.6173913043478265
