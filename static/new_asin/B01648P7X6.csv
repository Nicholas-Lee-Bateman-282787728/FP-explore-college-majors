7456062,5,B01648P7X6,"What you will witness in this two hours of video is joy, joy and more joy. You will never ever look at the stars of this video anymore the way that you have before since their chemistry, intelligence and the gift of natural properties are way beyond what you may have known about these species. Those parakeets are way beyond any imagination when it comes to their social life and that one parakeet with 130 word vocabulary puts few of my works into shame. This is a fun, educational, entertaining video that you will enjoy very much especially with your kids but be warned that after watching this video, there will be no way of convincing your children not to visit a pet shop and inviting one of those species to join your family and your home, sweet home. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1447977600,6,780,4.5

8735543,1,B01648P7X6,"I had seen clips of this with David Tennant narrating, which is the reason I purchased this dvd. Apparently this is the Americanized version, narrated by Brian Unger. I wish I'd known there were multiple versions!",1471824000,2,213,4.944444444444445

8735549,3,B01648P7X6,Good variety of content but was surprised at the low quality of the video portion. I'm watching on an LG 4k UHD OLED TV and the picture is blurred and double imaged throughout the movie. I expected better from PBS. I give this a 3....2 on video quality and a 4 on content.,1454976000,,272,4.150943396226415
