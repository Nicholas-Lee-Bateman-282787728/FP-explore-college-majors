8289039,2,B001CSHCYG,"""DragonBlade""'s claim of being the first full-length animated martial arts movie seems questionable (I'd think at least a few Japanese anime features could contest it), but it's at least the first 3D martial arts film ever made, having been produced a few years prior to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Panda/dp/B001ECQ75A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Panda </a>. With that said, it's not surprising that the latter received greater international recognition, because ""DragonBlade"" just can't deliver as a cumulative production. The attention paid to the martial arts aspect is evident, but the story and technology can't compete on the international market, even with features produced in the same year.

The story: Lang (voiced by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniel-Wu/dp/B00104AYGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniel Wu</a>&nbsp;in the English-only version I saw) is a martial arts student whose hometown becomes besieged by a violent monster called the Boar King. To save the day and defeat the beast, he will need to find the mythical DragonBlade - something he will only be able to accomplish with the aid of his teacher, his friends, and a noisy ""fairy bird"" called Bali-Ba.

The Cantonese version of the film features an all-star Hong Kong cast, including Stephen Fung, Sandra Ng, and Chim Sui-Man, whereas the English edition is a bit more bland: with the exception of Daniel Wu and Karen Mok (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallen-Angels/dp/B001O2UTR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallen Angels</a>) as his character's crush, the voice actors are all virtual nobodies with limited work to their names, and by and large, they're all pretty bad. Daniel Wu, Grant Thatcher (Bali-Ba), and Crystal Goh (Ari, the brother of Karen Mok's character) are among the worst offenders, getting on the nerves of anybody older than eleven with their whiny deliveries. Then again, these characters aren't written particularly well to begin with: screenwriters Trevor Morris and Yeung-Ping Sze (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Martial-Arts-of-Shaolin/dp/B00005MM79/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Martial Arts of Shaolin</a>) do a decent enough job of progressing the story from A to B, but slightly more intricate character aspects - like, for example, why this character is angry at that character - are lost on them, making the entire cast seem vaguely inhuman and detached from social reality. I've never been a huge fan of Hong Kong drama or humor, but this is just plain bad work.

The animation quality reflects the technological gap between China and the United States: a couple of scenes, like when the giant koi swim through the sky, are genuinely nice to look at, but mostly, the animation is a cross between a cheap weekend 3D show and video game cut scenes. The movie tries to hide this with anime-style character models (so there's no need to worry about things like moving hair), but things like the inflexible camera angles and stiffness of the environment (no particles effects and very little shading) give it away anyway. Luckily, the film does excel at one thing: the kung fu scenes are fun to watch. I'm not sure if the filmmakers used motion capture to get the intricate movements down, but even if so, it's a commendable feat. What pleases me most about these is that it seems like almost all of them could be replicated almost step-for-step by a talented action filmmakers: the swordfights on top of the chain web and on the bridge respectively made me think of Tsui Hark and Yuen Woo-Ping's work. I'd be excited to see a live-action version of this movie come about...

Of course, that's wishful thinking at this point coming from a martial arts fan who didn't see the kind of movie he was hoping for. ""DragonBlade"" will potentially appeal to a younger crowd that can't tell the difference between Saturday morning TV and Pixar yet, but animation aficionados in general ought to treat this as a minor curiosity or otherwise leave it be.",1337040000,,4134,5.630818619582665
