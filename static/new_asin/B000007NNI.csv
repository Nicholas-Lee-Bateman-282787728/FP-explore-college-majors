7905040,4,B000007NNI,"An interesting, yet not wholly successful film. However, despite some technical issues (the audio track is very muddy, which is a shame for a film that is centered around the main character reciting the contents of her writings and epiphanies) and a somewhat stage-y presentation, there is still much of interest here. This is the film version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Give-Sorrow-Words-Maryse-Holder-s-Letters-From-Mexico/dp/1493675575/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Give Sorrow Words: Maryse Holder's Letters From Mexico</a>&nbsp;and the production does an admirable job of attempting to translate her work to the screen. And while the merits of the author's experiences with drugs, alcohol, sex, bulimia, and more can be debated, one thing that really stands out is her attempt to transcend the everyday-ness of modern life to get to the essence of becoming self-actualized, enlightened, unstuck, free. On the other hand, although the lead actor (Jackie Burroughs) brings the right vigor and energy to her performance, she does appear to be significantly older than the character she is portraying (which detracts somewhat from the overall effectiveness). This film is not for the faint of heart or those easily offended. Nonetheless, it's an intriguing document that lingers in the mind.",1458691200,,1340,6.057894736842106
