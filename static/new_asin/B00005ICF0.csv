7938534,5,B00005ICF0,"First of all, I would just like to point out that the name of this video is misleading. None of the 4 episodes have anything to do with field trips,unless they mean the trip to the hot springs in ""Last Resort"" (which is more of a Tsukino family vacation,anyway) And now,on to the actual review.
This tape contains the Sailor Moon episodes ""Little Miss Manners"", ""Ski Bunny Blues"", ""Ice Princess"",and ""Last Resort"" They are great episodes,although some people might consider them filler,because they don't really contain any major plot twists or anything. ...But who watches Sailor Moon for the plot twists,anyway?
These episodes mainly focus on Serena,and how she signs up for a finishing school,enters a skiing contest,goes to skating lessons,and takes a trip to a hot springs with her family. But the fact that she's Sailor Moon (and also the Moon Princess) makes everything a lot more complicated....This is a collection of some of the funniest episodes of the show (with the exception of ""Last Resort"") and in my opinion,this tape is a must-see if you're a Sailor Moon fan. It might even be an okay thing to watch if you're not.",1015632000,5,1132,4.870466321243524
