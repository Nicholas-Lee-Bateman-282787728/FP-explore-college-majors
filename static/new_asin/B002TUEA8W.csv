3986174,3,B002TUEA8W,"The first time I watched this I could not get past 10 minutes, the slapstick in this movie is so over the top. I managed to get past that the second time and it turns out to be a pretty funny movie. There is a great deal of ridiculous slapstick, a few tender moments an a lot of funny business. There are a lot of cultural references I don't understand, and I am sure there a many Chinese puns in there, but I don't understand Chinese so they are sort of wasted. Some of the spelling  and grammar is bad in the English subtitles, but it is easy to overlook that. If you can get past the insane slapstick you should be able to enjoy the movie, it is fun.",1424649600,,653,4.023076923076923
3986175,5,B002TUEA8W,"A hysterical movie made even better by terrible, terrible subtitles. It's Street Fighter meets Eagle Shooting Heroes.",1414022400,,117,5.9411764705882355

3986178,5,B002TUEA8W,"Completely, unapologetically insane. Not at all serious about itself, and obviously put together by people who loved the hell out of the kind of movies they make fun of.",1412553600,,169,4.862068965517241
3986179,5,B002TUEA8W,This is a funny movie with a great cast.  Usually don't enjoy slapstick comedy but this one is hilarious.  The actors are having a good time doing the movie and no one takes themselves seriously.  Maybe that's the key for me.  Couldn't have asked for better quality in the product or service from the vendor.,1362528000,,308,4.545454545454546

8380636,5,B002TUEA8W,"Fantasy inspired from game Street Fighters and SunGonku in manga dragonball.
So many movie stars in this film. Made in the golden era of HongKong movie. If you know who these actors are, you will be shocked. The story is funny. Goof for teens.",1464652800,,243,4.545454545454546
8380637,4,B002TUEA8W,"Campy mix of sci fi martial arts and video games. This was inspired by Street Fighter, but often plays like a slapstick teen sex comedy too. Totally crazy plot.",1462492800,,160,4.551724137931035

8380639,4,B002TUEA8W,"Funny ...insanely funny. If you like drama and great plot, I don't recommend this movie for you. Actors and actresses in this movie are well known. Three cops from the future returned 50 yrs to the past to save the young Judge. This is a very simple , pure entertainment, that you want to watch on a Friday night.",1437696000,,313,4.322033898305085
