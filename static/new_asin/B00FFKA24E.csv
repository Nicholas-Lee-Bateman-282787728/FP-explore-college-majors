8622184,5,B00FFKA24E,Great small international film that is refreshingly free from the celebration of violence that so many recent films from Brazil have been. A talented individual struggles to realize her potential but with the relaxed beauty and grace that is truly Brazilian. Very nice digital transfer and strongly recommended.,1441756800,,311,5.5
