8397666,2,B003IQVNHC,"Do you read Chinese, Japanese, Cantonese, Vietnamese, or any other Asian language? Because if you do, you can read the subtitles in these movies to your heart's content. That's right - the asian subtitles are permanently in the movies. Some may say that this sucks - but I don't. No, I don't speak any other language that good 'ol english. These action flicks are so bad they're good in the laughable sense, and the subtitles just add to the comedy.
I can only asume these movies are in public domain. I also like how some other people who have bought this movie thought it was the sequel to the Expendables movie with Sly Stellone and all the other action guys. C;mon people, look at that cover. Nobody paints covers anymore. It's a lost art.
If you and your friends get together on a friday night, grab some Burger King or Little Ceasars pizza, and if you all like movies that are so bad they're good - then maybe you should buy this 4 movie set. That's 4 fridays of enjoyment. That's one whole month of cheeseball ACTION!",1313107200,8,1024,4.481283422459893
8397667,1,B003IQVNHC,"This is COMPLETELY a false perception of what is on the cover. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!

1st. it is NOT a new movie that the ""Expendables '2'"" would indicate.
It 'they' are movies from 1985 called Cobra Mission and its sequel 'II', the former with Donald Pleasance.
+ They are horrible copies, as if filming a film. Terrible focus, sound goes in/out. Looks like a Italian made (judging by opening credits) jungle rebel ""delta force"" type script with guerrillas capturing people - and ... well I don't know because I quit watching.

2nd. the cover also hints of animation 'sequel' of the now popular Expendables (2010) and NO it isn't.

Well - I thought this would be fun to see ""more"" adventures based on the new movie and I was duped.
If you are looking for ANY connection to the 2010 movie OR just a movie that may have same premise that is fun to watch - then this is NOT a good buy.
If you want some not even campy, badly filmed, `D' film about people getting hacked by a machete, badly dubbed, sound/music losing track and worst opening 5 minutes in film history then go for it.
I want my money back. And 5 minutes watching the opening in awe.",1291680000,18,1145,4.366197183098592
