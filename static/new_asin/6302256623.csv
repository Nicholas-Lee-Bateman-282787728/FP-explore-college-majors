7822872,2,6302256623,"Ponderous, dull, poorly paced and nastily misogynistic with wooden acting, laughable dialogue and an unexciting plot. Then again, it was from an idea by Ian Fleming and the director of 'Thunderball', so the misogyny was to be expected. The biggest saving grace is Eli Wallach as ""Happy"" Locarno, an Italian drug kingpin brought in to help the heroes investigate. In his one scene, Wallach brings life and energy to the story. Compared to the other characters, Locarno ended up being the only character I cared about.
It's no wonder; Wallach is the best actor of the cast and he deserved that Emmy.",1511913600,,597,4.862745098039215

For a buck, I was surprised at the decent quality of the movie.  Yul is cool, but don't except Charlton Heston to burst through the door and part waters.

Angie Dickinson, of limited 70s tv fame, is not an actress, but gives a studio intro -- a description of the poppy.  Her speech was a bit heavy on praise for the allegedly drug-stopping efforts of the United Nations.  Yeah, right!

Nevertheless, it keeps you going.

The ending left a blah taste in my mouth.  It seemed that the director just didn't know how to give the viewer a movie ending to a real-life ongoing problem.  I expected a bit more creativity based on the quality of the rest of the movie.

Overall: worth a buck!",1158105600,4,771,4.482014388489208
7822874,3,6302256623,"The Poppy Is Also A Flower is an odd movie of great interest to film and trivia buffs primarily for having the coolest, if not largest, international all-star cast, including Yul Brynner, Omar Sharif, Trevor Howard, Gilbert Roland, Angie Dickinson, Rita Hayworth, E.G. Marshall, Stephen Boyd, Anthony Quayle, Marcello Mastroianni, Eli Wallach, Trini Lopez, and Grace Kelly, just to name those I can recall. The film concerns UN investigators tracing irradiated drugs from the poppy fields in Iran through the entire process of smuggling, refining, and sale.  E.G. Marshall and Trevor Howard are the main protagonists on the trail of the drugs, which leads through the Mediterranean to Italy and Monte Carlo. Gilbert Roland is interestingly cast as a Mafia boss.

Unfortunately the film isn't very effective, almost dull, in spite of super stars in exotic locations, in the first half, until one of the protagonists is caught by the bad guys. It does get a bit suspenseful at the end, if you're still with it by then.

Sometimes it seems as if the dialog is dubbed or the soundtrack misaligned, or the acting just a bit stilted, though some is very good, especially Anthony Quayle as a cockney sea captain - he sounds like Cary Grant and looks like Victor McLaglen.  The film has a few sights you wouldn't expect to find in any movie: E.G. Marshall hiding under Angie Dickinson's bed; Gilbert Roland watching Trini Lopez sing La Bomba; and Rita Hayworth playing a drug addict. So I'd recommend it if you're interested in the trivia aspects, but not for escapist entertainment.",1124150400,8,1575,4.954545454545454
7822875,1,6302256623,"Strikingly and incredibly the dumbest movie i have seen in...well ever.  I am a fan of the genre of movies that depict the evils of drug use in bizarre and unintentionally humorous, but usually untrue ways.  Can anyone forget ""Reefer Madnes"" (1932) or ""Cocaine Fiends"" (1936) or ""The Trip?"" (1967)  They are made, I'm sure, with the intention of giving somewhat of a warning message intended for the general publics safety, but can be misleading and sometimes grossly overzealous in their efforts. And now they are just fun.  I first read about this movie a few years ago and was eager to add it to my movie collection.  Thank goodness for Amazon because it has been hard to find.  The cast/crew alone is intriguing enough in light of the subject matter for any movie buff.  Rita Hayworth, Yul Brenner, Marcello Mastroiani, Eli Wallach, E.G. Marshall, Angie Dickinson, Omar Shariff all appear and it was directed by Terence Young who made the fantastic ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967) and some notable James Bond movies.  Well, I know now why it has been so hard to find. It is an embarrasment to film.  I don't know what everyone was thinking when they collaborated on this venture.  Rita Hayworth's alzheimers was obviously already setting in for her to have even CONSIDERED this role, let alone taking it. Just a year before Omar Shariff appeared in ""Doctor Zhivago,"" one of the best movies of that decade and I don't even know what to say about Yul Brenner.  Just because someone earns an Oscar doesn't mean they should stop trying.  Which ever studio head OK'd production for this flick MUST have lost his job and it is no wonder American International Pictures went bankrupt less than ten years later.  And to boot it was produced for the United Nations as a television project!  The editing is choppy, direction only approaching mediocre at best, and the dialogue and acting at times is just downright bad.  Any of the actors who participated in this movie that are still living must cringe at the mere sight of a poppy now.  And with good reason.  In a masochistic way I had to watch it through to the end just to see how bad it would really get.  I wasn't disappointed. It was. Bad. Terribly bad.  It is a keeper for movie buffs only for the cast and to make you wonder what the ____ some of the best and well-known actors of the day were thinking.  If you like this genre of film, stick with the better ones mentioned above or any of the others made throughout the decades.",1076457600,7,2476,4.596810933940774
