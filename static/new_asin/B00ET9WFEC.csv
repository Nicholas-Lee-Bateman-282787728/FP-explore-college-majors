8609309,5,B00ET9WFEC,"Pure gold for going beyond the basics. The hows and whys behind mastering precise, dynamic footwork - of which you will find nowhere else - is demonstrated by Tim Waid. He explains how to protect yourself with realistic dynamic footwork, maneuvers, striking techniques and tactics in addition to offensive executions with precision. This DVD (and the entire series) offers key instructional points in progression, so pay close attention to all the details in the video. Tim Waid explains (and demonstrates) the major tactics behind how and why PTK dynamic footwork is executed through effective ranges - offensively and counter-offensively. One of the most important aspects in the martial arts (especially blade-centric arts) is footwork. If you don't have footwork, you don't have anything. Well worth the money.",1421798400,2,814,5.417322834645669
8609310,5,B00ET9WFEC,"""A SECRET IS KNOWLEDGE KNOWN ONLY TO A FEW BUT WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ARTICULATE IT, THE KNOWLEDGE IS WORTHLESS""  Tim Waid

This is the best martial art DVD I own.  Why is it ""so expensive?""  Because you won't find this information ANYWHERE else....ADVANCED FOOTWORK: Its essentially a strategy on training and executing a flow of combat.  To spell it out...the strategy is drawn out in CHALK on the ground as its being explained.  Its a master class in instruction.  The SECRETS are what is hidden behind the dogma that permeates martial training of today...and armed with this understanding, so one may train and execute more effectively.",1414540800,3,640,4.925233644859813
8609311,4,B00ET9WFEC,"If you are new to Pekiti-Tirsia, do not purchase this DVD since this video is meant to supplement the basic footwork that you would have learned from the Footwork DVD or from a qualified PTK instructor. You can attend 3-4 classes for the price of this DVD, and I believe you will receive more bang for your buck (as a beginner).

With that said, there's nothing bad to say about the quality or presentation of the information. My only real concern was that I paid too much for the DVD.

PROS
+ Clear instruction and diagrams
+ ""Secrets"" are not unsubstantiated claims. They are valid principles that will make PTK work better for you

CONS
- price is too high for quantity of material presented (only 1hr15mins long)
- training requires a partner that also has knowledge of the fundamental strikes and basic footwork",1399248000,3,816,4.652777777777778
