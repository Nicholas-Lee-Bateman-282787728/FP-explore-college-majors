4932851,4,B0062NAX42,Its a great set at a great price. I agree with others that the packaging could be better. I'm still on season one but one thing thats bugging me is that the episodes are not in order. I compared it to the IMDB page and sure enough out of order. There is a 2 part episode that is completely separated. BUT for the money I can deal with it.,1416960000,6,338,3.9130434782608696
4932852,4,B0062NAX42,Can somebody tell me if this collection has any subtitles???,1415750400,3,60,5.1
4932853,3,B0062NAX42,"I just got my copy, and wanted to get down a quick impression to help others who might be looking to buy the set.

Packing.
The set features a slip cover that has identical art work to the case itself.
It is housed in a clear plastic case with nothing written on the inside of the artwork.
The case is not the best quality and the flaps of discs stayed together, but fell out of the case when I opened it
The case also has a little catch lock on it.

I can't remember how the prior releases were, but in this set all the discs match each other.
They are grey and silver and say the complete series season X disc X so they are not repackaged discs.

Season 1 has 2 discs
Season 2 has 3 discs
Season 3 has 2 discs
Season 4 has 2 discs
Season 5 has 3 discs
Season 6 has 2 discs

There is an empty space
Then there is a last black piece of cardboard in the shape of a disc that just says Reno 911 on it. At first I thought it was a bonus disc, but it's just a crafty trick.

The Miami movie does not seem to be included. I have read a few places that the cardboard spot is put there so people can put Miami there and keep it with the set, but it would have been nice to have been included.

Season 1 disc one contains the first 8 episodes with commentary on 1 and 3
Just pointing out things in case anyone is curious.
Playing Episode 1 the  buttocks are blurred in the intro
At 8:30 during a line up of topless women the breasts have black bars over them.
at 8:50 whatever one of the women in the line up says it is beeped.

Disc 2 has the remaining season one episodes on it as well as 32 mins of deleted scenes

Season 2 seems to be uncensored in dialog,but in episode one of season 2 at the trailer park the nude man they chase after and try to arrest is blurred. He also gives the camera the finger and that is blurred as well.",1415145600,73,1827,3.9029649595687332

4932855,5,B0062NAX42,the way I see it this show is the scripted comedic version of the show cops...and the complete series for 33$ that's basically getting every season for roughly 4$ a pop. I will be buying this,1413936000,,191,4.333333333333333
4932856,5,B0062NAX42,"this item had a LONG expected delivery date, but shipped fast.  after almost a month it was clear why.  this item shipped from New Zealand. Having to travel through customs both in New Zealand and here in the United States would explain the long delay. It was well worth the wait though.  arrived more quickly than projected, and was very well packaged.  Still watching it, but so far, all discs have played well.

4932886,4,B0062NAX42,"Great product for the price, but a quick warning if you're buying this because you particularly like certain episodes and want to find them quickly: there is NO episode listing or guide whatsoever.  It merely comes with 12 DVDs (2 for each season), and the discs don't have any episode information on them either (they're labeled as Season 1, Disc 1, etc.).  Even the on-screen menu for each disc doesn't list the episode names, only the number.  So...if you're looking for a specific episode, you will have to look online for which season and then maybe try both of that season's discs to find it.  Not a huge nuisance, but would've been nice to have some sort of a guide.",1509580800,,673,4.583333333333333

It is like an R-rated version of Cops, but it actually goes into the personal lives of the deputies of the Reno County Sheriff's Department.  The first season is censored, but the remaining seasons are not.  (For some reason, they did not censor the n-word in the first season, though.)  Anyhoo, if you love a good, raunchy time, then Reno 911! is for you!!!  I had the entire series on DVD in my shopping cart on Amazon for months, and the price finally dropped to just $17, so I knew I had to scoop it up!",1508630400,,665,4.116279069767442

4932892,5,B0062NAX42,"This is a great find! If you're looking at this, you already know the show, so there isn't much more to say about it.

To those complaining about the packaging.. yeah, the inside isn't attached to the case, so be careful opening it.. no big deal... you're getting 6 seasons across 14 discs of a hilarious tv show for under $20, who cares if the packaging isn't ""premium"".

One thing I do hate is that each disc starts with an obnoxious amount of stuff at the beginning that you can't skip.. the usual ""do not copy this disc, it's a crime"" warnings. It makes binge-watching this slightly annoying (when playing on PS4, haven't tried anything else).",1506643200,7,647,4.568965517241379

4932902,4,B0062NAX42,"Great price for the entire series.  However, I took a star off because the episodes are not in correct order (at least for Season 1).  Edit: Season 4 is repetitive, tedious, and lazy.  There are way too many sketches that look left over from Season 3.  Example S.4.12. sketches are: screwed up two-way mirror interrogation, PSA, Mike Powers visit, Brothel complaint (really getting sick of this one), grade school presentation, special bulletin and cops don't know the mics are on, bike may get stolen, carnival complaint, D&D guy, etc.  We've seen all of these sketches over and over.",1501459200,,585,4.928571428571429
4932903,3,B0062NAX42,"So there is absolutely no doubt that this is an amazing deal I just had one issue with the product. The first 2 discs contain season 1 but the episodes are all out of order;

Order of Disc; True Order

Episode 2;  ep 10
Episode 3;  ep 8
Episode 4;  ep 2
Episode 5;  ep 3 ( if you watched the series from an online streaming source like Hulu or on Amazon, you would not have seen this episode.  Episodes 3 and 14 have been unavailable on most sites so it's pretty exciting that they are in this collection)

Episode 8;  ep 6

Episode 10;  ep 9

Episode 12;  ep 11
Episode 13;  ep 14 (this is the other missing episode and season finale)
Episode 14;  ep 13 (pt 2 of 2)

Everything else is in perfect order and it's honestly not a problem to watch the discs for the most part in the order they have them other than the 2 parter.

They will simply not play at all in many dvd players, cd drives for computers, etc.  When they do play they will freeze or the machine will randomly give an error message and stop playback.

4933041,5,B0062NAX42,"""Reno 911""...If ""Police Acadamy"" and ""The Naked Gun"" had been blended together with ""COPS"" and ""The Office"", then forced into the world of ""South Park"" or ""Archer"".  One of Comedy Central's greatest series, and one of the funniest TV shows to ever grace television.

Season 1 is censored (unfortunately), but the DVD packaging is decent, every episode plays perfectly, and the audio commentary is both enlightening and funny.  And... it's a real joy to hear the ""peanut butter"" morning briefing (Season 5, Ep 4) uncensored. Travis Junior's rant is one of the best moments of the entire run of the show, and it alone proves Robert Ben Garant to be (possibly) the funniest member of an absolutely genius ensemble.

Here's to Reno's finest.  Long live our idiots in beige...!!",1422835200,,773,4.961240310077519

I am so happy that they put the entire series together for sale.

I went out of town on business, so I took my portable dvd player, this series, and some of my other movies, to watch in my hotel room.

I popped the Season 2 Reno 911 disc in, and I never got around to watching any of my other movies. It had me crying I was laughing so hard.

I just kept popping Reno Disc after Reno Disc in the entire time I was in my hotel room.

4933054,5,B0062NAX42,"""Reno 911!"" was one of my all-time favorite comedy series.  Having purchased all six seasons of the show as they were originally released, it's great to have the complete series in one compact package.  As far as I can tell, there are no extra bonus features that weren't included in the original releases.  ""The Drug Arrest Prevention Seminar,"" a live performance from HBO's 2004 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, is included as a bonus feature in Season 2, even though it's not listed on the back of the DVD box.  In 2007, the ""Reno 911! - Reno's Most Wanted"" DVD was released.  It included several of the show's best episodes, along with a live musical performance of ""Don't Steal Cable"" as a bonus feature.  Unfortunately, ""Don't Steal Cable"" is not included as a bonus feature in the complete series box set.

For those not familiar with the show, a camera crew followed the comings and goings of the Reno Sheriff's Department, in a hilarious spoof of the TV series ""Cops.""  Leading the crack squad is Lt. Jim Dangle (Thomas Lennon), who wears short-shorts while on duty, and in his private life.  Deputy Trudy Wiegel (Kerri Kenney) is the offbeat officer who tends to her pet cats.  Deputy Travis Junior (Robert Ben Garant) has a better relationship with his canine partner than he does with the human members of the Sheriff's Department.  Deputy Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is the blonde bombshell who always gets her man!  Deputy Raineesha Williams (Niecy Nash) never breaks a nail while apprehending criminals.  Deputy S. Jones (Cedric Yarbrough) upholds the law, even when assigned to being a crossing guard.  Deputy James Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui) is the grizzled veteran of the squad, celebrating his fifteenth year of service in one episode.

Deputy Cherisha Kimball (Mary Birdsong) joined the show in season 3.  In the fourth season of ""Reno 911!,"" the cast perfected the quirky personalities of their characters, and found themselves in increasingly strange situations.  In my opinion, season 5 was the best season of the series.  Ironically, it was also the season where Jim Dangle literally jumped the shark as a running gag for several episodes.  Unfortunately, it was also the last season for Deputy Clementine Johnson, Deputy James Garcia, and Deputy Cherisha Kimball.  As revealed the following season, they were killed in a car accident in the last episode of the fifth season.  Sergeant Jack Declan (Ian Roberts), and Deputy Frank Rizzo (Joe Lo Truglio), joined the cast for the sixth and final season.  They were funny characters in their own right, but the cast's chemistry was somewhat weakened.  The final episode, entitled ""Wiegel's Couple's Therapy,"" didn't conclude with the usual cliff-hanger ending.  At that point, everyone must have known that the show wasn't going to come back for another season.  For me, it was worth buying the complete series box set, just to get to watch all six seasons in succession.",1418083200,14,2949,5.018518518518518
