8252865,4,B0013TR4HE,"Two poor sisters (who are living in what definitely look like middle-class circumstances) discover that they have two half-sisters from their estranged father's second marriage who were raised by a rich stepfather. Their single mother runs a travel agency, and sneaky grandma has big ambitions for her family. Meanwhile, the rich sisters aren't thrilled to have two more sisters, especially the spoiled, loudmouth blonde. She does a lot of complaining.

The mother of the two poorer sisters believes that her husband abandoned her and her daughters. However, Grandma has a terrible secret.

Meanwhile, the beautiful Barbara Mori plays their cousin who likes intrigue and causing trouble. Her conniving mother has led her to believe that an entire fund is hers, instead of to be split with the cousins, and Barbara has already spent more than her share. However, Barbara has a comfortable monthly allowance from her rich Daddy. A huge secret exists between her parents. Her mother made a desperate move to try to keep her husband many years ago.

Meanwhile, a consciousless crime lord becomes involved in the lives of Barbara and her mother, and is ready to kill anyone who gets in his way.

There are plenty of pretty boys, and lots of boyfriend drama. Who will end up with who?

Not everyone ends up happy. Some will die, some will go to prison, and some will find love.",1294790400,,1371,4.917748917748917

I wish I could have seen this one on TV like most of the others, but I never saw it advertised on TV Azteca in my area--bummer. I found they definately trimmed it down to the most intense parts. But it' still almost 800 minutes.

I did have a technical problem with chapter 14, it stopped mid-way through it and went straight to the menu. I tried it twice on two different players but kept stopping in the middle of the chapter. I had to just start chapter 15 instead. But overall it was a great story and very intense at times. I dont' know how these actresses have the stamina for some of these scences. I was exhausted watching them!

I have to laugh because some of the translations were really funny (incorrect).",1213574400,2,874,4.284848484848485
