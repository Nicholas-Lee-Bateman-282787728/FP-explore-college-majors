4932061,5,B00626KGHS,"I have seen this twice.  The first time, it introduced me to new ideas about philosophy, evolution, biology, cosmology and the modern moment; the second time, I saw how much more information was packed into the film - in its images, in its words, and in its entirety - that I missed the first time.  I will watch it a third time.

I am an alum of one of the author's schools and familiar with the other author as a professor, and I can say that a subject that often comes up in our classrooms is how to entice the average person* into wondering about, learning about and then participating consciously with, the journey of the universe.  This is how you can do it: take a dense, complicated topic and introduce them to it in a way that is happily digested, packing the most information into each chosen word and constructed sentence with its carefully crafted image, so they are open to it, curious to it, and then watch it again and again to uncover the next layer.  That is all it takes to bring someone in the flow; they'll get another book on the subject, watch another video on it, and now their journey begins - they start participating.  Learning about cosmology, physics, astronomy, biology, socioeconomics... scratch that - learning about life does not need to be boring, tedious, or academic; it can be easy, entertaining, an beautiful.  And once someone does start to join that ride with the universe, they'll notice how much easier, more fun and more beautiful their life is becoming by consciously participating in the evolution of our planet as our planet dances along the journey of the universe.

(*By average person, I mean someone who does not spend much, if any, time thinking about the planet or the universe, or humanity's involvement with either.)",1394150400,2,1769,4.683870967741935
4932062,3,B00626KGHS,"This documentary hints at many interesting scientific and philosophical ideas, only to abandon them at first glance. It seems as though the writers did not trust enough in the audience's intelligence to go deeply into anything.

4932065,5,B00626KGHS,"Journey of the Universe is worth every minute one spends watching it.  In fact, one can't just watch it; it challenges you to imagine, to think.  If there is any criticism, it is that it is too rich with ideas for a film approximately one hour long.  It presents so many ways, hermeneutics, of viewing the history of the universe that a single viewing was not sufficient.  Fortunately, the invitation to learn and think did not detract from the over-all feeling of humility, awe and love that the film engendered in this viewer.  The final question put to us by Brian Swimme remains long after the film ends:  knowing what we know now, how can we allow the energies of the universe within us to recreate the face of the earth.  It is unfortunate that Amazon no longer has this wonderful movie in stock.",1346198400,,802,4.527777777777778
4932066,5,B00626KGHS,"I saw this film when it broadcasted on WNET and consider it one of the most important films of our time. It transforms and educates in the same way Joseph Campbell's Power of Myth might have when it released.

Journey of the Universe tells of a voyage, a unique 14 billion year ongoing expedition where we, as humans, now stand at the crossroads playing the integral role of potentially controlling how the ensuing chapters shall progress. It is a story of science. It is the story of history, of memory and of future. It is equally the unfolding story of the humanities. Journey of the Universe is an epic tale told through hundreds of thousands, and millions of millions of little tiny stories that are being told all at the same time. It is a self-energizing tale of process, and an accounting of self-awareness; not just of the self-awareness of humankind, but the self-awareness that each living cell of each plant of each life form has inherent within it. It is animal to land, land and water to atmosphere, plants to air, earth to sun, solar system to universe and so on. It is the tale of the weaver, and of the knitting of each element to the other that then becomes the story unfolding.

Journey of the Universe is the evolution of childhood, of shared, self-amplifying and symbolic consciousness. It is the story of becoming human. And while Journey of the Universe is an epic film, it also asks a titanic question, for it peeks at the control we exert on our surroundings and asks us to consider if we, as a race, properly govern and correctly steer toward our collective future or are we fatally injuring the very thing we need and cherish most?

Journey of the Universe asks us to transform everything we thought we knew into something fresh and exciting. It tells that us we can. It inspires us to do so. It explains in a language all can understand that we are the stars, the nourishment, the passion and the creativity, and that we are living the dream as we dream it.

Journey of the Universe is the story of knowledge unfolding. Bluntly, this film can change your entire perspective on life and I highly suggest you view it.",1343779200,7,2143,4.572916666666667
4932067,5,B00626KGHS,"I watched this program on my local PBS station during a fund raising period, which unfortunately, is every other week it seems.  The station was offering the dvd with any pledge of membership and they mentioned that there were plenty of extras.  I was disappointed to find it was not available but on further searching I found it is available directly from the producers at Journey of the Universe.com.  The website did not give much in the way of details but I ordered it anyway.  I was disappointed to find there are no extras on the dvd at all.  Maybe there are on the blu-ray version (or with a pledge membership?). If the website had more info I might have ordered the blu-ray.  I can always get the book Journey of the Universe to find out more.
At any rate, I enjoyed the hour-long (approx. 54 minutes) program without any pledge breaks.  And what an hour it is.  Great presentation, good graphics and I have a keen interest in the subject matter.  I particularily like the spiritual aspect of the cosmos that Brian Swimme discusses.

4932069,5,B00626KGHS,"Is it the universe that is on a journey, or is it us, or is there a spiritual commonality between the two and a mutual journey?  Almost every scene of Dr. Swimme's ""Journey of the Universe"" focuses on an idea, a concept, an intellectual construct that provokes further thought.  This is not a flashy enhanced graphics display of cosmic vistas; rather, in its conventional approach, one can see the brilliance of Swimme's pedagogical skills.  He is a naturally gifted teacher.  (I use the word brilliance as often as I give a film 5 stars... rarely.)  Dr. Swimme compels us to embark on a higher intellectual plane as we consider who, where, and what we are as humans.  While founded almost exclusively on science, his inter-disciplinary approach to the topic reminds me of the writings of William Irwin Thompson, an internationally renouwned philosopher and cultural historian.

Dr. Swimme exposes the generally unconsidered links in virtually everything that is a part of the human condition and existance.  This is heavy stuff presented in an appetizing and easily digested manner, though it is for the most part appropriate for adults.  While I've only viewed ""Journey of the Universe"" once, I'm convinced a second or possible third viewing will yield more ideas, and intellectual constructs for consideration.",1488153600,2,1313,5.126760563380282

4932111,5,B00626KGHS,"From the beginning to the end, this film is cleverly, carefully crafted and engineered to build defensible arguments and facts upon defensible arguments and facts to stack up a highly-likely, credible notion of how and why things are.  It almost answers the question that I first heard when I heard Stephen Hawking say (or quote) ""Why is there anything at all?""

The host of the show, Brian Thomas Swimme is an astounding intellect!  He really showcases his deep thoughts and insightfulness in quotable quotes so often in this film that your head is left 'swimme-ing'!  This is objectively the best explanation of the journey of our precious universe that I have seen in my 60 year long life and I've seen practically all of the 'science' flicks of this ilk (cosmology, astronomy and the like).

I truly believe that Mr Swimme is one of the premier intellects of our time based on this film.  It is a 'Must see"" for anyone who craves knowledge and likely ideas as to: how things came to be; why they are and who we humans really are; why we (and life) exist; the direct link between the origin of our universe and our highly likely coming to be from the beginning.

It covers the origin of the coding of information by life for future use by beings of some sort; there is in DNA, a record of things that were and what was successful to survive on this earth.  Among the many stunning quotes from Mr Swimme in my humble opinion, is this: ""With the appearance of the human, the coding process of life burst beyond the DNA molecule and began carving its information in stone.""  ...and he doesn't just spit this out ad-hoc, there is a long sequence of indisputable logic that precedes this (with other amazing insights and quotable quotes)!

If you crave stunning graphics and flash, you probably are not going to be as big of a fan of this as am I.  But, if you crave demonstrations of abject, raw human intellect and insights into why and how things are with astonishingly clever take-away quotes, you are absolutely going to LOVE this.

I have watched it three times already and I plan to study it further with many more viewings.  This is a very deep well that is filled to the top with water - you can dip into it again and again and still receive the refreshment you crave.

Thank you, Brian for so selflessly, sincerely and humbly sharing with your fellow humans, your wonderful gift of intellect and insight that our amazing universe has bestowed upon you!",1425686400,4,2460,4.574031890660592

4932122,1,B00626KGHS,"The topics are interesting, but so much of the narrative is incorrect or oversimplified.  This ""documentary"" has such a bent that everything is presented as an ""amazing balance"" that if it were not maintained - our universe never would have existed.

Perhaps this is amazing to elementary students, but why is there is need to simplify to the point where it will need to be corrected later?

Example:  movie discussion suggests that every element is generated by exploding stars ....(supernova are cool topics, but really!)
Reality : Nucleogenesis creates the lighter elements out of normal everyday activity of stars carrying out nuclear fusion.  Yes, the heavy elements (Z >56) are thought to be created by rapid neutron capture events from supernova events ... but not everything.  This represents a relatively small percentage of the mass of normal matter in our universe.  We struggle to quantify the amount of dark matter- which we have little information about....

Example:  movie discusses how the rate of big bang expansion is critically on target (within a millionth of a percent) to create galaxies and stars and LIFE...
Reality:  No one has reported the rate of expansion to six figures precision.  Who does these ""critical calculations"" and what are their assumptions?  The reality is that we struggle to identify what is in our universe and how much is there.  We should not presume we understand the universe even vaguely well enough to make such sweeping conclusions about our understanding.

The dialogue is filled with sappy metaphors.  There is a continuous assumption that we need to explain life with tidbits from cosmology to biology.  These grand speculations are exactly that:  speculations!

Example:
""Earth has had to adapt itself to maintain that ....""  special temperature needed for life.

""A living cell has the power to learn through time.  This is what distinguishes the first cells from all the other beings that existed ....""

The dialog seems to imply that planet Earth and all living things learn and have a ""will to change"" which enables them to change and evolve.  Are we taking another giant leap backwards in understanding to suggest that the giraffe got its long neck because it had a will to reach higher leaves?

In many ways, the show is a promotional tool for the island of Samos.  OK, perhaps they need the promotion.  However, this intellectual romp of deductive reasoning attempting to put the pieces of cosmic facts together to explain how humans are human is largely irritating and shallow. The suggestion that humans are beginning to understand the ""powers of the universe"" is contextually absurd.  If we look back and reason how no one before us had the ""right understanding"", it is quite presumptuous to suggest we are any different today.

It doesn't look as if we will ever limit our greed.

There's some consolation in the thought that the universe will not have any remorse for having given rise to such a grasping species as ourselves.  Climate change, plate tectonics, the evolution of the sun, our whirlpool of a galaxy and the expansion of the universe will dispose of us.  The idea that we matter is an illusion.

4932128,1,B00626KGHS,Far from it. I hate when a documentary turns into a lecture on how humans are evil and killing the planet and everything. I didn't come here to be scolded.,1394668800,8,155,4.2
8491016,3,B00626KGHS,"A nice film. Honestly, nothing new here for me, and the film could not hold my interest. But there wasn't really anything wrong with it.",1529193600,,136,4.48
8491017,5,B00626KGHS,Journey of the Earth or symbolic consciousness would be a more appropriate title but definitely an interesting and non-offending view.,1512086400,,134,5.75
8491018,1,B00626KGHS,"Not a scientific film.  This is more of a new age, Gaia presentation...really disappointing.  If you want a humanist, secular, Earth-worship introduction, then watch it.  If you want a genuine scientific understanding of the state of cosmological research, look elsewhere.",1508716800,,272,5.75
8491019,4,B00626KGHS,I like this. I did not find it boring or stall. It's made for tv not to create quizes and tests from...,1508457600,,103,3.727272727272727

8491021,5,B00626KGHS,Very nicely done!,1497398400,,17,5.0
8491022,1,B00626KGHS,"Same old thing, turns into saving the Planet and drops space journeys all-together. Scare me again. I watched the documentary at 3 billion people we are all supposed to be dead by now. Funny to watch the predictions of today then.

Stupid! not space stuff",1495411200,,255,4.666666666666667
8491023,1,B00626KGHS,Don't bother. Just another religious undertaking trying to ride on the coat tail of science.  Ooo Ahh,1493596800,3,101,4.9411764705882355
8491024,1,B00626KGHS,"Too bad I couldn't just give it zero stars.  This show is scientific hooey.  That is, its' not scientific at all.  I stopped watching when the narrator started with a false ""watchmaker"" posit.  That is, the narrator wants us to think that no other condition (rate of BB expansion, in this case) would have resulted in order and, therefore, life.  He doesn't know that.  No one knows that.  No one will ever know that because there's no way to compare different conditions.  An untestable statement is not science.
Also, the narrative of this video misrepresents scientific history.  It oversimplifies the major accomplishments of many scientists.
Really, not worth watching.  If you want a religious sermon, go to church.",1492300800,6,721,5.033898305084746
8491025,5,B00626KGHS,"This is a much watch for those who enjoy films about the earth and cosmos.
I almost did not watch it based on some reviews, but I am very glad I gave it a chance.

This program is very well done, with very high production value, beautifully shot and put together. But more important than that, it provides, what seems to me, a unique context within which you can view and think about the purely scientific information many shows espouse. Not that this program is devoid of science, but this program looks through a much wider lens. Ignore those who are quickly dismissive,
This is a smart program with a unique approach in telling a story that you think you know.  It will alter the way you look at the earth and the cosmos, Dont miss it.",1491091200,,738,4.37956204379562
