8458187,5,B0055F5TF6,"Paul Leduc transports us from the time of the discovery of America to the present day, through a world of music and images. The film mixes and intertwines the characters in space and time, to talk about the clash of cultures, the incredible adventure of ethnic miscegenation, and the struggle for liberation. The director manages to move through a purely visual language, the spirit of the novel by Carpentier without resorting to dialogue.",1409270400,,440,5.041095890410959
