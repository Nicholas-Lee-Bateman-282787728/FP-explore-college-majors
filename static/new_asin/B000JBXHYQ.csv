Highly Recommended",1187654400,2,188,4.027027027027027
8149488,5,B000JBXHYQ,"It's such a great mix of ""documentary"", scripted writing, historical as well as, current events. This had to be an ""independent film,"" None of the big corporate studios would have made this.  Exactly why, independent media, including film, radio and television are so important to our nation and our society. Censorship, govermental controls, military might, policemen on every corner, protecting democracy, while an older hippy type sits on the sidewalk, fearful of being pepper sprayed for wearing a tie dyed teashirt! This film has it all! Sounds boring and depressing doesn't it? But it's not! This is why I highly recommend it. The story line is upbeat, fun and interesting. A delightful cast, in lots of groovy NYC street scenes keep up a fast pace, and kept my attetion through out. It speaks volumes about several of the very serious issues facing our nation today, yet in a good way. With out the usual doom and gloom political films can sometimes become.  Go ahead, get it, you'll be glad you did, and have something to think about for months ahead...as we try to carry on in our nation divided. With creative talent like this, (all of the people involved in this project I mean ;), America will find a way to remain, 'The Land of the Free, and the Brave.""",1176595200,3,1266,4.75
