After receiving this item I put it in my Blu-ray/DVD/Karaoke player; it would not play. I put it in a DVD player; it would not play. I went on deployment for 12 months, returned and I put it in my PS3; it would not play. I tried my Blu-ray again; it would not play. I put it in my laptop; it asked me what I wanted to burn onto this BLANK DV-R!!! Of course now it is too late to complain to this lame merchant who ships BLANK DV-Rs as a finished product.

Over the past 7 years I have purchased thousands of dollars worth of materials through Amazon and I do not intend on stopping. HOWEVER, the Nicene Council will never see another penny from my coffers.",1342396800,,791,4.136363636363637
8529835,1,B000LTTF6A,"I watched this video and was utterly disappointed to see how Muslims distorted so much of history - trying to second guess American and British motives during many wars. Over 95% of the worlds wars are Muslim based, check it out yourself. This video tends to deal with Muslims who are moderate in their faith but if they truly followed the Quaran and applied it ""WHOA!!!"" how frightful it would be. Read the book of Sura in the Quaran!!! Its ok to beat your wife, confine her to the womans room, hate the Jews and on and on. I did not see this addressed in the DVD. I wish they had made it known that the DVD was a promotional for becoming Muslim. I do not see Islam as a religion of peace especially after reading the Quaran. KNOW ISLAM, NO PEACE. I wish I had spent my money on something worthwhile - instead I wasted it on this dvd.",1237507200,,835,4.225
