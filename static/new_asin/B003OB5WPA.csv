8401542,5,B003OB5WPA,"This is the best DVD for learning guitar in my collection. Love Sue's style of playing guitar, and she has good teaching skills.
The DVD has accoustic and electric songs to learn. The structure and format is easy to use, even for beginners. She is also informative regarding different traditional styles of playing which influenced her. This broadened my respect for some of the older blues styles coming from our Southeastern states. I recommend it, especially if you like Sue Foley music, which I do.",1371686400,3,502,4.91764705882353
8401543,5,B003OB5WPA,"I didn't realize this was an instructional video when I bought it.  Nonetheless, I love it.  Sue Foley is incredibly talented: super tunes, awesome guitar playing, beautiful voice and very attractive to boot.  She is the complete package and such a sweetheart.

While it is an instructional video, she gives complete performances of the tunes she is presenting -- and they are fantastic.  So every Sue Foley fan really should get this video.",1280793600,7,441,4.986301369863014
