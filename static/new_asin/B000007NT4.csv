7905189,5,B000007NT4,"This is truly an exceptional behind the scenes look at the most versatile director in Hollywood history. This documentary depicts Hawks through a series of interviews with those who worked with him and those who certainly  learned from him. Those interviewed are James Caan, Lauren Bacall, and the  film directors, Michael Mann (The Insider), Peter Bogdanovich (What's Up  Doc?), William Friedkin (The French Connection), and, of course, Howard  Hawks. The film covers virtually every film of Hawks, although absent was  the 1941 classic ""Sergeant York"" -- can you believe it, he  directed that one too!, but none the less they're all lined up:  ""Scarface"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""The Big  Sleep"", and my personal favorite, the great ""Rio Bravo"". And  there are so many more! The highlights of this brilliant biography are the  stories told from James Caan, and the candid conversations from the man  himself, Howard Hawks. The home footage is a gem too, showing Hawks doing  what he liked to do best: enjoying life to the fullest, and being the  Reniassance man that carried over in his films. Extraordinary persona.  Great documentary!",959212800,,1139,5.0864864864864865
