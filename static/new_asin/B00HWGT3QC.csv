8636899,5,B00HWGT3QC,Out standing true life documentary that will pull out your heart strings. Derick and Beverly Jorbert are two amazing people that somehow were lucky enough to find each other in this big world. And even more amazing is how they have dedicated their lives to bring awareness to all of us about how fast our animals are disappearing in the wild. Fantastic photography and educational plus a must see true life drama that will change the way you think. I recommend all of their documentaries they haven't won all the awards for nothing ,1487548800,,532,4.720430107526882
8636900,5,B00HWGT3QC,"this is outstanding.... if you want to understand lions, this is a great place to start",1476144000,,87,4.5
8636901,5,B00HWGT3QC,"It's a lion documentary, parodying the name of a very popular TV series, with narration by one of the most famous lions in film, Jeremy Irons (Scar from the Lion King).

Who else would you want teaching you about the troubles a lion cub goes through growing up, than the infamous lion who made life a nightmare for the young Simba?

The documentary itself is well-written, the scenes are excellent and the political-spin on the pride dynamics fits quite well. You'll never look at lions quite the same.

Compared to his earlier lion documentary (he's done two?!), The Last Lions, this docu seems a bit gimmicky and contrived, but that doesn't keep it from still being among the best documentaries out there.",1466121600,,707,4.778688524590164
