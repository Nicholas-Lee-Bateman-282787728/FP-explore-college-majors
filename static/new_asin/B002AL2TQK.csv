3886004,5,B002AL2TQK,"This is a superior product.  I can't imagine how a DVD set could be produced any better than this one.  Not only are all 24 episodes fully restored and uncut, for crystal clear image quality, but you are given the option to view each episode with a filmed introduction by either Lucie Arnaz, Desi Arnaz, Jr., or a guest performer in that episode.  This is a very cool feature as you get a bit of background on each episode by someone who was in it.  And just wait until you see the extras!  I was left speechless when I saw all the goodies that have been included.  It's going to take me awhile to get through them all.  But these include press releases from 1968, read by Lucille Ball's own secretary, Wanda Clark; lots of home movie footage, including home movies shot on the set of several of the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour episodes, and movies from vacation and leisure time; an episode of Lucille Ball's radio interview series, ""Let's Talk to Lucy""; lots of behind-the-scenes footage; and much more.  For what you're getting on this set, it's a HUGE bargain.",1251158400,11,1058,4.531578947368421
3886005,2,B002AL2TQK,"Lucille Ball's third venture into sitcom land marked her last successful TV show. The flaming redhead was now playing a widow with two teenagers.
The tried and true situations written for her were getting stale. For the start of the 1968 Fall TV season, 57 year-old Ball was getting old. Even her heavy makeup and elaborate wigs could not hide her age. Nolonger would she allow to be filmed closeup. Any funny facial expressions she was known for in ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Lucy Show"" were a rarity on this dated show. A slew of weekly guest stars, Ball's children and old fart co-star, Gale Gordon is what carried this show for its 6 year run.
The Arnaz kids, Lucie & Desi Jr. inherited the show upon their mom's death. It spent many years on and off in reruns. Some bad prints have even been bootlegged prior to this legit release. Rather than let the tapes collect dust, the Arnazes found another way to cash on them yet again.",1251072000,11,929,4.470588235294118
3886006,5,B002AL2TQK,"Thank goodness both ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy"" are on DVD.  While ""I Love Lucy"" is great, there was more to Lucy than just Lucy Ricardo. ""The Lucy Show"" and ""Here's Lucy"" are must-have for any Lucy fan and for those who appreciate how great TV comedy once was.",1249084800,10,267,4.34
3886007,5,B002AL2TQK,"""Here's Lucy"" was Lucille Ball's third successful TV series.  It ran on CBS from 1968 through 1974.  The series never received the recognition that her previous series (I Love Lucy and The Lucy Show) received.  However, it was CBS' top series during the 1970-71 season (no. 3 rated series).  ""Here's Lucy"" was a top 10 performer when ""Laugh-In"" was one of her major competitors and the Number 1 show during the 1968-69 and 1969-70 seasons.  However, Lucy was able to overthrow ""Laugh-In"" during the 1970-71 season.  Both ABC and NBC couldn't kill ""Here's Lucy"" with a stick.  It was a Top 15 Show for five of its' six-year run.  Not only was Lucy able to compete with ""Laugh-In"" and eventually overthrow it in the Nielsen ratings; Lucy managed to compete with major theaterical films that NBC and ABC slotted against her.  It also was able to kill most of the competition including ABC's ""The New People,"" ""The Silent Force,"" ""Peyton Place,"" and ""Monday Night Football.""  I'm glad that MPI will be releasing all six seasons.  It truly is another classic Lucy  series.  The most notable episode in ""Here's Lucy"" was in 1970 ""Lucy Meets the Burtons.""  Not only did it rate as the number one show for the first week of the TV season in 1970 but it received a whopping 52% share of the audience.  This episode also recieved two Emmy nominations; one for writing and one for Gale Gordon as Best Supporting Actor In A Comedy.  I think the TV Academy overlooked Lucy's performances in this series and Lucy should have won an Emmy for the Burton/Taylor episode.  Other classic episodes include Lucy and Jack Benny, Lucy the Fixer, Lucy and Flip Wilson, Lucy and the Rapids, Lucy and Lawrence Welk, and the five appearances that Vivian Vance made from 1968-1972.  ""Here's Lucy"" just further established that Lucille Ball is the Queen of Comedy and TV's First Lady of Television.  She will never be forgotten, especially now, with the release of the first official season of ""The Lucy Show"" by Paramount Home Entertainment (hopefully we'll see seasons two through six), the season sets of ""Here's Lucy"" along with the release of the Lucille Ball Specials; the first two specials being released by MPI on June 30th.",1243814400,6,2204,4.783068783068783
3886008,5,B002AL2TQK,"This Summer of 2009 is a Lucy Summer! In July we are getting the first season of The Lucy Show, thanks to CBS/Paramount and on August 25th, we are getting the first season of Here's Lucy, thanks to MPI Home Video. Some of the great shows of Here's Lucy have already been on dvd by Shout! Factory, and it is a great set, but now we finally get to have all of it complete!

When I heard Here's Lucy Season 1 is being put out by MPI Home Video, I immediately contacted MPI for more information- especially about the quality of the video! For anyone who is familiar with MPI Home Video's quality of their dvd's, you know they can be horrible or superb. MPI put out the first season of The Beverly Hillbillies, The Honeymooners 6 sets and Hullabaloo's- all very poor quality, loaded with graininess and scratches. MPI also put out The Doris Day Show- all 5 seasons and Family Affair's all 5 seasons, and the quality is superb, very clean and crystal clear! MPI is also known for putting out all of a show's seasons separately and then in a complete set later on. I spoke to MPI directly to find out the quality they are putting into Here's Lucy Season 1, and they assured me that they are remastering the original 35 mm film, in exactly the same way they did for Doris Day and Family Affair. This means the dvd's will be absolutely superb in color, crystal clear sharp picture and a clean film! As a huge Lucy fan, this was great news for me! They also stated, that on June 30th, 2009, they are putting out the first of The Lucille Ball Specials dvd. These are two specials that Lucy made after Here's Lucy, starring with Dean Martin and Jackie Gleason. Both Here's Lucy and The Lucille Ball Specials will have extra's included. I was really happy to see that the film quality is absolutely superb on this first season! The perfect picture, gorgeous color and detailed sharpness are beyond my expectations!

Here's Lucy was Lucille Ball's third television show, that premiered on CBS on September 23,1968. The show started out with weaker than expected ratings, but gradually picked up during it's 6 season run, from 1968 to 1974. Lucy played a widower, Lucy Carter with 2 teenage children Kim and Craig Carter. The children were played by her real-life children Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr.. Their Uncle Harry was played by Gale Gordon and Vivian Vance also made guest star appearances in this show. Lucy, as a single mom, worked at the Unique Employment Agency, which allowed her to sing, dance and act with the many wonderful special guest stars she featured on this show. In this first season alone, some of the guest stars were Jack Benny, Jackie Gleason, Shelly Winters, Eva Gabor, Wayne Newton, Van Johnson, Wally Cox, Carol Burnett, Cesar Romero, Victor Buono, Howard Keel and Tennessee Ernie Ford. This show never got the number 1 ratings that I Love Lucy received, or even the number 2 position that The Lucy Show finished with, so it was rarely syndicated on tv, making many of these great shows rarely seen for decades. For Lucy fans, the summer of 2009 is one we will never forget, as we will finally have The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy and the first of The Lucille Ball Specials dvd, to watch whenever we want after so many years of wishing!

Here are the 24 Episodes of Here's Lucy Season 1:

3886010,5,B002AL2TQK,"Lucille Ball began her third weekly series on CBS on September 23rd, 1968. After selling ""The Lucy Show"" to Paramount, Lucy wanted to own her own show, so she created ""Lucille Ball Productions"" to produce her new sitcom. Lucy had already finished an amazing run on CBS with her ""I Love Lucy"" show in the '50's, and her 1962-1968 series ""The Lucy Show"" never went out of the top 10. It was very important for CBS to keep her as the network knew Lucy had a loyal fan base that wanted to watch her week after week. ""The Lucy Show"" finished its final season in 1968 at #2 in the national Nielsen numbers, so expectations were high that ""Here's Lucy"" would be an even bigger hit. Lucy had nothing to worry about: both the fans and critics loved her new show, with ""Here's Lucy"" staying in the top 10 in its first three years.
 ""Here's Lucy"" was different than Lucy's other two series in that she cast her real-life children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr., as her on-screen kids Kim and Craig. Lucy also brought back the marvelous Gale Gordon as her brother-in-law Harry and boss at the Unique Employment Agency in Los Angeles, which was the setting of the series. Lucy played Gale's crazy secretary. The wacky redhead continued to make viewers laugh for six more years on CBS, and many fans, including this one, believe ""Here's Lucy"" was Lucille Ball's best television work. Lucy has even admitted that out of all her shows, this one was her favorite.
 As the 1970's arrived CBS wanted to change its image as the ""rural network"" by canning shows that featured longtime tv personalities like Ed Sullivan. Lucille Ball was a different story however. ""Here's Lucy"" would continue well into the '70's as CBS' top-rated show. In 1970-1971 ""Here's Lucy"" finished the year as CBS' #1 program!
 In 2004 ""Here's Lucy"" made its debut on DVD with a 24 episode boxset featuring the best episodes of the series. That boxset has a ton of special bonuses including commentary by Lucy's kids, rare network TV promos for the show, a much more. In this new ""Here's Lucy"" Season One Boxset special features will include new videotaped interviews never seen before and new introductions by both Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr.. Other rare gems are Featurettes, Screen Tests, home movies, making of the main title, and a rare interview with Gale Gordon. It is wonderful to see MPI bringing back this beloved show that has been rarely seen on television in the past two decades. The series had a CBS daytime run from May-November 1977, and in 1982 ""Here's Lucy"" went into national syndication. The sitcom has rarely been seen on cable stations as it surprisingly does not bring in good ratings. In the late '90's PAX TV aired the show for awhile then it disappeared. The studio also promises to release every season in individual boxsets so that is something to applaud.
 This boxset contains all 24 shows of the first year uncut and digitally remastered from the studio's 35 mm negatives for excellent video and audio clarity. A total of 144 episodes of ""Here's Lucy"" were produced. The first three seasons were fimed at Paramount studios in Hollywood, but the last three years were shot at Universal. The most famous episode was the season premiere of the third season in 1970 featuring Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. That episode catapulted ""Here's Lucy"" to the top of the ratings and put Lucy and the Burtons on the cover of TV Guide that week.
 In the show's first season boxset many stars are featured including Jackie Gleason, Shelley Winters, Jack Benny, Wayne Newton, and more. The pilot of ""Here's Lucy"" is included called ""Mod, Mod Lucy"", where Lucy has to perform in the place of her daughter in a band. Lucy tries to sing, albeit with her mouthing the words to a record, and she proves she is quite a dancer. You will laugh hysterically when Lucy comes out donning a black wig, trying to be a teenager. She really fits in with the younger generation!
 Many other celebrities graced ""Here's Lucy"" over its run including Eva Gabor, Carol Burnett, Ann-Margret, Johnny Carson, and more. Vivian Vance also made many guest-star appearances over the years as Aunt Viv to the delight of fans everywhere.
 Don't forget too that ""The Lucy Show"" makes it first-time debut on DVD in July with the Complete First Season boxset. That series too is excellent.
 UPDATE: ""HERE'S LUCY-THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON"" ARRIVES IN STORES NOVEMBER 3rd, 2009!!!",1242864000,30,4420,4.731168831168831

3886142,2,B002AL2TQK,"I watched the first episode for free (yes, you are looking at a PRIME customer right here folks), it kinda sucked. The actors playing her kids are the big low point, especially when it's just them onscreen. Lucy can still carry the show, and her boss while cartoonish in a classic sitcom sense, can still help bring things to life with good timing etc. This looks like a pretty standard sitcom. The first ep is the standard ""I have laryngitis"" arc used in zillions of shows over the years. It ends with a painfully long music and dance number whose only real highlight is a brief drum solo (and I think he's actually playing the drums here, not like Danny Partridge with the muted cymbals etc.). It feels a lot like Lucy trying to prove she's still young and vibrant (think Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia!). If you're an old fan or a Lucy die-hard this might be for you, but otherwise, meh.

Personally I found the costumes and cultural elements etc. really entertaining. It's interesting and funny to see how networks were trying to represent the 60's as they were happening in terms of the mods, the hippies, and the whole culture clash between generations.",1407369600,2,1154,4.601941747572815

3886147,5,B002AL2TQK,"Lucille Ball was made for full-blown color.  As much as I like her in ""I Love Lucy,"" I am so happy to have her in eye-popping color that matches her zany personality, her sense of humor and her beauty.
""Here's Lucy,"" season 1 features Lucy as a mom of two teens, Kim and Craig (played by her real children - Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr.).  The stories are focused around her family and her job at the Unique Employment Agency, where she is employed by her brother-in-law played by Gale Gordon.  Many of the stories are really funny, a few are off-the-chart silly; but all of them are highly entertaining as only Lucy could deliver.
The guest stars are an added plus to the series:  Jack Benny, Shelly Winters, Eva Gabor, Wayne Newton, Vivan Vance, Carol Burnett, Tennessee Ernie Ford (I dare you not to cry when he sings ""Little Green Apples"" - just gorgeous) and Cesar Romero, just to name a few.
One of the things that really makes this series work for me is her kids.  Lucie and Desi are both so talented and a delight to watch, particularly in the musical numbers, and it does seem that Lucy liked to incorporate a little song and dance here and there.
The extras are fantastic: a radio interview of Gale Gordon conducted by Lucy, Lucie and Desi Jr. screen tests and a featurette about the show called ""Meet the Carters,"" to name a few.
Each show has the option of being played with a short introduction done mostly by Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. (a few are done by actors who appeared on the show - one being Wayne Newton, who clearly adored Lucille Ball.)  These intros made this DVD something really special.  Getting Lucie and Desi's insight, memories and stories from being on the show are invaluable.  You can really feel how much they love both of their parents and how much they respected their talents.  It's obvious that they put everything they had into making this a wonderful DVD package; it was done with love.

I wanted to order the first season of her third (of four) sitcoms, ""Here's Lucy"". My main reason for purchasing this was just to see how well Lucy worked with her real life kids, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. I was also very interesting in seeing what Miss Ball quit do ""The Lucy Show"" for and then decided to do. This series is very entertaining (more so than ""The Lucy Show"" in my opinion...) and it finished at a healthy No. 9 in the 1968/69 Nielsen ratings. Not only does Lucy still shine in this ""silly, goofy, innocent comedic gem"", it has a bus-load of guest stars that appear in the very first season! They include: Jack Benny, Jackie Gleason, Eva Gabor, Carol Burnett, Wayne Newton (and band), and let's not forget Lucy's old play Vivian Vance back as ""Viv Jones"". I must also clear that Amazon.com has made a mistake claiming that this Complete 1st Season has no special features: it does! Besides from an interview with Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. about doing the series, there are several other things as well, like Lucie and Desi, Jr.'s screen-tests for their mother's 1968 movie ""Yours, Mine, and Ours"" (with Henry Fonda).

3886195,5,B002AL2TQK,"I love Lucy.
  I also love Lucie.
  And I hate the fact that I wasn't on the Cape to catch An Evening With Lucille Ball: Thank You For Asking!, the one-woman show directed by Lucie Arnaz and starring Suzanne LaRusch as Lucie's mom.
  Those expecting an evening with Lucy Ricardo or Lucille Carmichael or Lucille Carter, three of Lucy's best-loved TV personas, should leave the pre-conceived notions at the door. Though Lucie says the play is ""not heavy and there's enough Lucy Ricardo for people to be satisfied,"" the premise is less comedic: Lucille Ball is giving a Q&A seminar at a college in the '70s . . . recalling and reminiscing and remembering.
  I caught up with Lucie on a warm Monday afternoon, lounging by the pool of the Connecticut home she shares with Luckinbill (whom she married in 1980). She had just returned from a whirlwind weekend in Los Angeles taping intros for the upcoming DVD releases of seasons 5 and 6 of Here's Lucy (the TV show in which she starred with her mom). Having a conversation with Lucie is like having a chat with her mom (and I have) - both are warm and fuzzy, smart and sassy, genuine and, well, on the ball.
  Besides directing the show, Lucie is promoting her new CD Latin Roots, getting ready to do ""a long slew of cabaret dates,"" and hoping to continue directing, proudly revealing that she recently spent time ""shadowing"" a director on the set of Desperate Housewives. It's not all work: In July, Lucie and Larry will celebrate her 60th birthday with a month-long vacation at a rental beach house on Maui.
  But now we have her, even if for a just minutes.

How did you get involved with the show?
There are lots of Lucy impersonators out there, but Suzanne is the best. The Lucy estate has always supported her emotionally, and when she brought us the idea for the show, we said yes. The script was pretty good, but along the way some people gave her some ideas which were rotten. Yet the show was too good to die and it went through several incarnations. Then Suzanne started not trusting her work, she ran out of the money and couldn't afford a director. Larry and I helped out a little financially. [Laughs] A little? A lot! I had suggested a friend to direct, but he got a job with Jane Fonda. Suzanne asked me to step in. I had never directed before, but I took the chance. I clarified some things in the script and gave Suzanne notes and suggestions. It was a good marriage, even if it was a bit weird directing my ""mother.""

Did you feel your mom's presence?
Yes. Not to get too metaphysical, but when I was directing Suzanne, I felt my mother's energy guiding me as I tried to find the truth of a moment.

Your mother was a genius, even though she told me she was not, making an indelible mark on TV history. So many people think Lucille Ball is Lucy Ricardo.
Audiences know Lucy Ricardo but not Lucille Ball. For decades, the one question people have been asking me is, ""What was she really like?"" From the looks on their faces, they want a happy answer. They do not want to believe that my mother was not the woman who stomped grapes or who sold Vitameatavegamin. I tell them Lucy was a character, while Lucille was a real person, responsible and serious. That`s what I hope this show does - I`d like audiences to come away with the answer to that question. I want them to feel, ""I have finally met Lucy.""

Right when I got this from Amazon, and opened the package, I noticed right off that the packaging for these season sets are just like 'The Lucy Show' ones which are the clear plastic case, with the DVD spindle inside, and the episode's listed on the inside, I've been a fan of this style packaging since I first saw it with the Gunsmoke releases, so nice packaging? Check, then I popped in the first DVD to watch the pilot episode 'Mod Mod Lucy' not knowing what to expect for quality, what I saw right off was a crystal clear picture, with very vivid colors, I swear this looks like it was made yesterday, and the audio is on par with the video, so, nice remastering job? Check!

It's been a long time coming, but finally, us Lucy fans are getting treated, because of course all the 'I Love Lucy' seasons are out, CBS/Paramount is in the midst of releasing 'The Lucy Show' in which they just released season 2 in all it's color glory this past July, and MPI Home Video releasing 'Here's Lucy' and the 2nd and 3rd seasons are already out, and I will be getting them very soon, as I'm very happy with what they've released on this season, so bottom line, Lucy fan, GET THIS SET/SERIES, now don't expect 'I Love Lucy' or 'The Lucy Show' because all 3 of said shows are different, which shows how talented she really was, Lucy will live forever!",1284163200,2,1816,4.434131736526946

Lucy's Safari - Horrible

Lucy Gets Her Man - Horrible, I couldn't even watch it all the way through

Lucy the Shopping Expert - Classic and family-themed humor

A Date for Lucy - Has its funny moments especially with the kids trying to get Lucy to date.

Lucy and the Great Airport Chase - A great different Lucy with Lucy and Harry working together to outrun spies.

3886200,4,B002AL2TQK,"In 1968, not long after production had wrapped on ""The Lucy Show"", Lucille Ball embarked on the third TV incarnation of her beloved Lucy character in the sitcom HERE'S LUCY.

Recruiting her own two teenage children, Desi Arnaz Jr. and Lucie Arnaz, for supporting roles (in addition to her old stalwart Gale Gordon), the show revolved around widow Lucille Carter, raising her two kids, Kim (Lucie) and Craig (Desi Jr.); and working for brother-in-law Harry (Gordon) at Carter's Unique Employment Agency--unusual jobs for unusual people!

Despite, quite literally, having grown up in front of the camera, Lucie and Desi Jr. were very reluctant to join the show when Lucy first approached them (Lucie even had her mother agree to write her character out of the show if early audiences didn't register); happily they added lots of youthful excitement and energy to the series.  Suddenly Lucy herself seemed younger as well!  Many episodes in the first year showcase great musical numbers for the kids--Lucie has some really far-out dance routines!  In addition the guest stars are amazing...Shelley Winters (in her FIRST sitcom appearance), Wayne Newton, Eva Gabor, Carol Burnett, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Mary Wickes, and of course Lucy's dearest comedy playmate, Vivian Vance.

""Mod Mod Lucy"" - Kim and Craig are excited to be performing at a big society birthday party, but when laryngitis sidelines Kim, Lucy (with the singing voice of Carole Cook) steps in!

3886211,4,B002AL2TQK,"Lucille Ball was a pioneer in comedy, paving the way for women in television, by proving that a woman could be the lead in a sitcom.  When The Lucy Show ended in 1968, Lucille Ball was TV's Queen of Comedy, and had the power and clout, to do almost anything she wanted to do in the medium.  Astute in business, as president of Desilu Productions, Ball was used to calling the shots.  Desilu produced The Lucy Show (1962-68), but when Desilu was sold, Ball decided to end the program, even though it was ranked No. 2 in the ratings, and she had just won a second Emmy for her performance as Lucy Carmichael.  Lucille Ball was clearly at the top of her profession, but instead of taking a break, she embarked on a brand new project.

Produced by her own company, and executive produced by her husband Gary Morton, Here's Lucy (1968-74) debuted in the fall of 1968, and featured Lucy again working with Gale Gordon, who had played her boss Mr. Mooney, in The Lucy Show.  In the new program, Lucy was Lucy Carter, a widow with two teenagers, who worked for her brother-in-law Harrison Carter (Gordon), the president of Carter's Unique Employment Agency.  The really big news about Here's Lucy, was that the show would feature Lucy's children as her TV kids.  Seventeen year old Lucie Arnaz played her daughter Kim, and fifteen year old Desi Arnaz Jr., played her son Craig.

The youngsters did not have extensive acting experience, and although they undoubtedly received preferential treatment, they still had to work very hard to make the grade.  It is fun to see the siblings grow in confidence and ability, as the season progresses.  Their presence gave the show's writers some fresh new angles to work with, as Lucy had never had to deal with teenagers before, and the kids also had talents that could be incorporated into the storylines.  Lucie was a tall girl, with a big physical presence, and an affinity for comedy, singing, dancing, and loud yellow wardrobe.  Her career path later took her to the stage, where she met and married actor Laurence Luckinbill.  Younger brother Desi was an aspiring drummer, who eventually made a career as an actor and musician.

While the relationship between Lucille Ball and Gale Gordon, remained a backbone element of the program, and their shtick remains much the same, it is less mean spirited than in The Lucy Show, and Lucy Carter almost never resorts to hysterical bawling that Lucy Carmichael did.  Carter is older, wiser, and more dignified, than Carmichael, and the physical pratfalls are reduced to a minimum.

Lucille Ball was 57 when the series started, and with nothing left to prove, Here's Lucy seems to be more of a vehicle for Lucy to have fun being creative, nurture her kids, and work with people she really liked and respected.  Old friends like Vivian Vance, Carol Burnett, Jack Benny, Mary Jane Croft, and Wayne Newton make appearances in the first season.

Here's Lucy featured numerous kooky situations, musical and dance numbers, and guest appearances by some of Hollywood's elite.  Reality didn't get in the way of delivering the comedy, as the show played fast and loose with the audience.  Practically everyone knew what to expect from Lucy, so the writers often took shortcuts.  The objective was to quickly setup the humor, serve it up, and close.  The stories are mostly straightforward, rarely involving sneaky schemes or trickery that was common on The Lucy Show.

Lucy And The Great Airport Chase, features Lucy and Harry running around LAX, trying to evade some spies, for almost the entire episode.  This is the kind of crazy freeform romp, that programs like The Monkees were known for.  A Date For Lucy, features debonair Caesar Romero as a slick jewel thief.  The episode Lucy And Tennessee Ernie's Fun Farm, with guest star Tennessee Ernie Ford, is nearly all production numbers.  Lucy's Safari, features the entire Carter clan in a completely ridiculous jungle trek.  Episodes featuring celebrities were Lucy's specialty, such as when the Carters vacation as house guests of Jack Benny.  For a taste of old school Lucy, there is Lucy Goes On Strike, where Lucy demands that Harry give her a raise, then suspects him of planning to bump her off.

As was done some years back, for a best of Here's Lucy DVD collection, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. share their loving remembrances of their mother, and those involved in the production of the show.  Particularly in the first season, Here's Lucy was very much a family affair.  There are some marvelous bonuses, one concerning how the siblings came to be on the show, along with tons of home movies.  A radio interview conducted by Lucille Ball with Gale Gordon, reveals that Lucy was one sharp cookie, and that Gordon was truly a humble man.

The format was very flexible, and the writing a little sloppy at times, but Lucille Ball was doing her thing, her way, and America was liking it, as Here's Lucy finished its inaugural season as the ninth most popular show on television.",1277856000,2,5009,4.798368298368298
3886212,4,B002AL2TQK,"If you love the comic genius of Lucille Ball (like I do), buy this DVD of ""Here's Lucy"", season one.

Have a modest knowledge of what was going on in our country in the late 1960s, and you will better appreciate the humor in this DVD set.  You will see the influence of the popular secret agent movies of that time (""Lucy and the Great Airport Chase""). You will know when, in one episode, Lucy is referring to her then-recent hit film, ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" (""Guess who Owes Lucy $23.50""). You will recognize Jackie Gleason's signature quote and his successful television character (""Lucy Meets Jack Benny""). Being ""hip"" in your late 1960s knowledge will also help you appreciate references to hippies, Sonny and Cher, and the then-popular ""Here Comes the Judge!"" quote.

Lucy is in a class by herself doing slow-motion physical humor (""Lucy's Safari"".)  Her co-star, Gale Gordon, is Lucy's perfect foil, particularly with their great slapstick in ""Lucy The Fixer"".  Gordon, himself, is hysterical with his birds-and-the-bees monologue in ""Lucy the Shopping Expert"".  Lucie Arnaz' show-stopping talent is displayed as she does an impression of Wayne Newton in ""Lucy Sells Craig To Wayne Newton"".

3886214,4,B002AL2TQK,"Maybe it`s not an outstanding comedy like The Lucy Show, but it`s still a good solid tv comedy in its own right.
Adding Lucy`s kids into the show may have been a mixed blessing. True, it gives the writers more material to work with and the kids
are very talented, but somehow it doesn`t quite work as well. Not to say there is really anything wrong with the show, just that
it`s not as good as the earlier Lucy shows.
Gale Gordon is still in the show, this time as uncle Harry. Ball and Gordon have such a worderful comic chemistry togather that
you really can`t go wrong with these two.",1260144000,3,587,4.297297297297297
3886215,5,B002AL2TQK,"Here's Lucy showcased her talent for comedy as well as her Children's talents. This was Lucy's third show..  I Love Lucy/Lucy Desi Hour was first. Then there was the Lucy show. This third incarnation bring her real life children (Lucie and Desi) playing her kids.

The Amazing part is the show meshes so well. The real realationship blend as the reel ones does. This version had great slapstick comedy that Lucy was known for. However it usually also  focused more on musical and dance numbers proffessionally thrown it and it worked. Gale Gordon was Lucy's foil as her brother-in-Law Harry. He was Lucy's rock in comedy and kept her grounded.

One of the extras I enjoys is introduces befor the episodes usually either by Lucie or Desi. On the forth disk, this is chock full of extras from how the made the open titles to a clip of the Lucy Radio show she did in 1962 with Gale Gordon.

If you loved Lucy as we all do..if you are fan of good comedy, get this quality set. I hope the second season is as good  as this

Gale Gordon played ""Mr. Mooney"" beginning in Season 2.
 After six seasons, Lucy decided to end ""The Lucy Show"" and try a new concept with a new tv series, ""Here's Lucy"".
  Lucy's character was now ""Lucy Carter"" (age 57) with her teenage children, Kim and Chris (played by Lucy and Desi's real children, Lucie Arnaz (age 17) and Desi Jr. (age 15)). Gale Gordon (age 62) was now ""Uncle Harry Carter"". Vivian Vance would make visits.
  Each episode begins with an ""Introduction to Lucy"" with Lucie Arnaz (Luckinbill) and Desi Arnaz Jr or a surprise guest. They will describe the episode you are about to watch. They are spoilers.
  If you want to be surprised instead of what guest star will come through the door, you may choose not to see the introductions, but can watch them later.

  There is one special episode, broadcast in 1969, not to be missed that was completely filmed on location at LAX--The Los Angeles International Airport.

  Many guest stars and familiar faces: Doris Singleton, Lew Parker, Jack Benny, Sid Gould, Jackie Gleason, Jonathan Hole, Reta Shaw, Shelley Winters, Jack Collins, Tim Herbert, Ray Kark, Joseph Ruskin, Peggy Rea, Eva Gabor, Victor Sen Yung, Wayne Newton, Van Johnson, Vivian Vance, Wally Cox, Bruce Gordon, Mary Wickes, Whit Bissell, Carol Burnett, Carole Cook, Sid Haig, Mary Jane Croft, Cesar Romero, Victor Buono, Howard Keel, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Jack Gilford.

Disc 4 contains more episodes and the Special Features.

  If it wasn't for staying over at grandma's house I probably would have never seen ""Here's Lucy"" then, including many other CBS tv shows.
  Now as an adult, I can sit back and enjoy the surprise of which guest star is going to come through the door and situations Lucy is going to get herself into next.
  As a youngster, I did not like the character that Gale Gordon played, but when I got older and saw Gale Gordon in one of his last interviews, I realized how much of a gentle soul he was. After watching this DVD set and now middle-aged myself, I find the Gale Gordon character so funny to watch when he is flustered in a comedic way. The facial expressions and mannerisms that Gale Gordon acted with was a trademark of his own.
  Wayne Newton makes an appearance in episode 9. Vivian Vance makes an appearance in episode 12.

3886218,4,B002AL2TQK,"I've been a huge Lucille Ball for most of my life. What I love about Here's Lucy is you don't find reruns on television for this show like you do I Love Lucy. I'm sure I watched all of these when they were originally televised when I was a kid, but after watching a few of these episodes from this DVD, it's fun to see them again since I don't remember them. The clarity of these is such that in one of the longer scenes you can see Gale Gordon sweating (badly) as the scene goes on. I don't think that would be noticeable on television back in the late sixties or the seventies. I also loved many of the extras on this DVD. Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. treat us to things like the Making of The Main Title, which I like the idea of, however, my only complaint is that there is no sound and you can see Lucy doing a little bit of speaking with what looks like the director, so that part of it is disappointing. A real highlight for me was a lost interview Lucy did with Gale Gordon in the mid sixties. I'd never heard this before and love hearing Lucy and Gale talk shop interview style. The series production files were also fun, with Lucy's secretary reading the ""files"". One of my favorite things in the extras, and I can't remember which special extra it falls under, but Lucie is talking about when she and her brother joined the Here's Lucy cast and mentioned an ad Desi Arnaz took out in the Hollywood Reporter. They didn't show the actual ad, which again, I found disappointing, but you see the wording from the ad scrolled across the screen, which brought a tear to my eye, it was so touching. The episode introductions, done by Lucie and Desi Jr. also give some interesting 'Lucy facts that I found interesting. For any die hard Lucy fan, this DVD is a must have in my opinion.",1254528000,2,1790,4.267647058823529

3886232,5,B002AL2TQK,"I am 48 and have been a huge Lucille Ball fan my entire life.  When I was a teenager HERE'S LUCY was the Lucy creation currently airing.  Of course I was enraptured by the repeats of I LOVE LUCY and THE LUCY SHOW.  But when I think of my youth this show was a staple.  It was always my favorite show and Lucille Ball always had me so enraptured it was as if she was a part of my family.

This summer is providing huge treats for Lucy fans as we get the beginning of the complete series of both THE LUCY SHOW and HERE'S LUCY.  I am always amazed at how each series after I LOVE LUCY had a basic plot synopsis that was very real and believable while being very different from I LOVE LUCY.  She was always LUCY, the madcap lovable persona who always got into trouble by trying to do the right thing.  But Lucille Ball always stayed true to the basic plot of each series which was actually a stage for her to use her unique and original comedic gifts.

Here she plays Lucy Carter, a widow with two children and it is such fun to see her with her own children Lucie and Desi Jr.  She works for her grumpy, penny piching brother in law Harrison Carter who became a unique and perfect comedic partner for Lucy in many of her antics.  Yes, the slapstick is a little different here.  It is not as loose and doesn't appear as improvisational (We all know she never improvized and rehearsed like crazy.)  She is older than I LOVE LUCY and uses different aspects of her comedic skills.  Her comedic timing and expressions are priceless and just as hilarious as any splapstick situation.  Believe me, the slapstick is still here but we get a little more of a mature LUCY and all it does is show even further how gifted Lucille Ball was.

There are 24 glorious episodes in this season one of HERE'S LUCY and they are brilliantly remastered.  The color and clarity are crystal clear.  This is what all of us Lucy fans have been waiting for.  To see the great comedienne in color is a gift in itself but this set is put together with such loving care.  It is overflowing with extras.  Each episode has an intro.  There are Lucy home movies, Lucie and Desi Jr. screen tests and many featurettes and interviews.  Lucille Ball managed to make the entire carnation of the character LUCY starting with I LOVE LUCY to always be vulnerable, intelligent with a certain innocence and always hilarious with a true heart of gold.  She managed to make sure the antics never went over the top so the viewer can always root for LUCY.  This series is a part of television history and the true comedic legacy that is Lucille Ball.",1252972800,4,2598,4.340248962655601
3886233,5,B002AL2TQK,"I have just finished viewing ""HERE'S LUCY:  Season One"" and I am very pleased and impressed.  The episodes have beautiful picture and sound quality.  The opening theme is trimmed to eliminate Roy Rowan saying ""brought to you by...,"" but considering we got a taste of the full length opening in Shout Factory's best of HERE'S LUCY episodes, we can live with that.  The episode featuring Cesar Romero is a little too tall.  I could tell that from the opening episode credits after the main theme.  The heads get cut off a little and the image looks slightly off centered vertically, but it looks better from the party scene on.  None of the commercial breaks are trimmed as with ""THE LUCY SHOW:  The Official First Season,"" so it makes for a very pleasant experience watching these shows from beginning to end.  We get plenty of great extras thanks to Lucie Arnaz, Desi Arnaz, Jr., and many other participants.  I can't wait for season two this November and I am also awaiting MPI's release of THE MOTHERS-IN-LAW later this year.

3886236,5,B002AL2TQK,"I hesitated to buy this DVD as a fear of quality issues.  The only time that I had seen this series over the years was during late night reruns.  The quality was always terrible in those old re-runs and I feared it would show up here.  As a matter of fact, those old reruns actually gave me a reason to NOT buy it.

I WAS SUPRISED to see crystal clear remastering of this great show.  The quality of the DVD is SO good, it gives new magic to the show!  The additional interviews with the children and other former guests make it even more entertaining and a way to learn some of the behind the scenes info on the actors.  It's a bit strange (in a good way) to see Lucy in more modern backdrops that what we're accustomed to seeing on DVD.

Again, brilliant remaster, and seems almost like ""new"" films.  One episode was even filmed on location at the L.A. airport...wild to see how much that place has changed and the brilliance of the quality (can even read vintage ads in the background).  I'm viewing this on a 1080p TV with a 1080p true upconverting DVD player--but it looks great even on a regular television.

Yes, Lucy is older, comedy is a bit old fashioned and antics sometimes corny, but any Lucy fan will enjoy this great new DVD...I'll be waiting for Season 2!",1252108800,3,1271,4.343220338983051
3886237,4,B002AL2TQK,"""Here's Lucy"" is the only series of Lucille Ball I have not seen all the episodes during it's initial run, and in syndication.  We were a ""Laugh-In"" family, and when this show was at 8:30, it was bypassed.  Once it went back to 9:00, my parents said ""NO!"".  Granted, they had daily reruns of ""I Love Lucy"" coming out of their eyes and ears with my obsession, so I guess they thought enough was enough.  Regardless, I now get to see the entire series end to end once all six seasons are out.  Season One is a joy.  The episodes are great in quality presented and quantity of comedy, song, dance and all-around fun.  I never knew Eva Gabor was in a first season episode, as I only remember the Hospital episode after Lucy broke her leg.

The extras are superb.  My one disappointment here was the filming the opening credits feature.  You are getting all the different aspects of Lucy and how she did her smile and wink.  I thought there would be more of setting up the animation part, and showing the infamous Lucy-doll.  My only other disappointment is the chop-off of the last few notes of the opening theme on each episode.  I'm sure this was because of Roy Rowan's infamous ""brought to you by"" phrase.  We all know shows during this era were sponsored.  However, by 1968, the sponsor's name was not part of the title.  It was inserted after the ""brought to you by"".  Granted, these credits are an improvement over the ones for syndication, as the music and picture fades fast after they state Desi Jr's name.  As a completest, I would have wanted the entire theme, with the brought-to-you-by phrase, then start the episode.  Makes the show complete & doesn't take away from Roy Rowan's great voice-over work, as he had been with Lucy since the 50s.  It was done on the Shout Factory Best of, so why not here?  Lastly, the introductions to each episode (if you choose this option on the menu) are superb.  Lucie, Desi, various guest cast, all give a synopsis, comment & airdate...all very informative.  My only annoyance here is the Gab Entertainment credits for each one ""Introducing Lucy"" appears for each of the 24 episodes.  I would have only done this title on the first show only, with the synopsis, and followed all remaining episodes with just Lucie, Desi, Jr and the guest cast introduction only.  By episode 20, I was at a point of ""get to the people talking about the show already"".  This should be considered being changed for Season 2 and onward.

My criticisms make me award this only 4 stars out of 5.  It is a great achievement to get this series out to the public.  Just needs a few tweaks for the rest of the series for total perfection.",1251676800,4,2657,4.511530398322851

3886239,4,B002AL2TQK,"Lucille Ball will forever be remembered for ""I Love Lucy,"" the iconic sitcom that set the standard for hit TV comedy.  After ""I Love Lucy"" finished its run in 1957, Lucy starred for several years on ""The Lucy Show.""  Then, in 1968, she started her third sitcom, ""Here's Lucy,"" which ran until 1974.  ""Here's Lucy - Season One""  finds Lucy Carter (Ball), widowed mother of Kim and Craig (Lucie Arnaz, Desi Arnaz, Jr.), working for brother-in-law Harry's (Gale Gordon) employment agency.  Lucy gets into assorted conflicts at the agency and with its clients, and the episodes have generous doses of sight gags and Ball's masterful physical comedy.  Vivian Vance made numerous guest appearances.  Other guests who appeared during its six-year run include Carol Burnett, Eva Gabor, Jack Benny, Jackie Gleason, Joan Rivers, and Wayne Newton.  In addition to 24 remastered episodes, the four-disc set contains videotaped episode introductions; a new featurette, ""Meet the Carters;"" home movies and behind-the-scenes footage; bloopers and outtakes; episode promos; production files; a lost ""Let's Talk to Lucy"" radio show; screen tests for Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr.; and a featurette about the making of the series' main title sequence.",1251244800,3,1235,5.297435897435897

However, you may not be familiar with how ""Here's Lucy: Season One"" has been packaged and presented in this new release, so I'll use this review to provide my opinion in that regard. Let me say right off the top, if you are a Lucy fan, I highly recommend that you purchase ""Here's Lucy: Season One"".  I received my copy in the mail yesterday.  I'll first address the packaging.  The outer package is the familiar, clear, plastic, clam-like box, with the artwork inserted.  The discs are stored inside on a spindle, which is hinged to the spine of the box.  Because of this design, when you open the box, you can see the episode titles listed for each disc, appearing on both inside panels. Specifically, this means that you do not have to remove the discs to read the titles listed on the inside panels. The discs are one-sided with colorful labels featuring the ""Here's Lucy"" logo and the familiar marionette. The menus are very easy to navigate, and the discs are void of other product promotions.  You can select to watch the episodes with or without a filmed introduction by Lucie Arnaz, Desi Arnaz, Jr. or the episode's guest star.  The quality of the video is absolutely sensational. The images are crystal clear, and the colors are probably more vivid than they appeared when originally broadcast.  The extras alone are worth the money. I don't want to give away too much but they include: Desi Arnaz, Jr.'s screen test for his mom's 1968 theatrical film, ""Yours, Mines, and Ours""; creation of the opening credits; and film of the Queen of Comedy golfing with The Great One himself, Jackie Gleason.

8359697,3,B002AL2TQK,"In preschool and grade school this was the Lucy show airing at the time so its kind of a sentimental favorite..though of course it is not Lucy's best work..(ILL is the BEST of all sitcoms...) Being the third series that aired during a time of change I think the show gets unfairly maligned..it is much better then The Lucy Show's post Viv years and some of the episodes are quite good on their own..the problem is that when the show is bad..its really, really BAD.

The Good:
Lucy is back in top form...she had divested herself of Desilu and is back to actually performing instead of reading cue cards like she did on the Lucy Show. She looks great..(though its funny she had to be in her 50s and there are references to her being her 40s..) its not until the later episodes when she broke her leg that she starts to look ""old."" and that might have more to do with those bad ""old lady"" overly done big ""hair dos"" and clothes that anyone over 40 seemed to wear in the late 60s early 70s.

The Lucy character works best in domestic/family situations. Lucy's real kids are here and they have a real affection for each other you can't fake. It was smart to make Gordon's character her brother in law...so working in the family business is a good excuse for them having to put up with each other (never made sense why Mooney put with Lucy Carmichael) Lucy and Harry eventually establish a nice brother sister chemistry as they slowly move away from him yelling at her all the time and he becomes her foil/co conspirator in her capers. Gordon is good with an insult and Lucy is just as good with her snap backs and her the ""look"" she gives him all the time. Lucy also gets back to her""Lucy Ricardo"" character and move away from the moronic Lucy Carmichael..(though in some episodes she is still a moron.)

The Bad:

S1 has way too much of the old Lucy Show with Harry yelling at Lucy and Lucy actually saying ""Yes sir!"" There is still too much of the Lucy character acting like a moron..and the kids are not that great of actors in the beginning, and they do not act or dress like any teenager on earth.  There is too much reliance on ""old"" guest stars like Jack Benny Cesear Romero and Milton Berle...(sometimes you can smell the Bengay coming from the screen.).and the ""young hip"" stars are as bland as can be..(Donny Osmond..Wayne Newton) Lucy, who could have had anyone writing for her stuck with the old Lucy Show hacks who rely on some really bad one liners and dumb vaudville type situations.  The production is sometimes really cheap...Lucy and Harry's office is clearly Mooney's office redone as is her house a redone set from her old apartment. Also..the camera pulls back and you can actually clearly see the end of the set..as Lucy's living room carpet ends and you see a tarp set up.

All in all a nice sentimental..(makes me feel like Im in the first grade again watching on bad green carpeting..) sometimes actually funny and good..favorite.",1510704000,3,2950,4.51310861423221
