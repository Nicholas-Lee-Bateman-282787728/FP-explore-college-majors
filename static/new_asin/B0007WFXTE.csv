2246322,5,B0007WFXTE,This is a really weird movie and you have to be a little weird to watch it. Its a little romantic which becomes silly. The wrong people become one person. The living facilities are disgusting. And Randy Quaid makes a definitely Mad Doctor who just can't get his experiments right and the goo is costing him a lot.

2246324,3,B0007WFXTE,"This movie is so over the top and often plain silly that those that can't enjoy such efforts should avoid it. However I liked this movie , it's funny and so damn wierd!  But unlike alot of over the top movies it has a clear plot and doesn't take it self seriously. It's got that wild attitude of a party flick that takes no prisoners. The makeup in this movie is outstanding. ANd proves that cgi should be used only on somethings and not on places where makeup can do a better job.  A good example of this is the new fright night. the use of cgi vampire effects looks bad in comparison to the older versions make up version or animatronix creature effects. Obviously cgi is better on space craft etc. but here we get awesome effects that were made by humans. This movie is so over the top that when watching it you can only sit there and think 'what the heck!!!!! nothing is taken seriously to  a degree. for instance a stewardess asks passengers whose bomb is this?"" and then stows it away. Then we have the freek show of really bizaare freaks that the mad doctor played by the cool Randy QUaid creates. This movie would not be for alot of people but on many levels a kid would embrace the gross freeks and the general fun and this one is not for anyone who can't take this kind of over the top flick. I liked it and the actors do carry the wierdness without being disdainful to what is obviously a b movie romp. So serious movie buffs who can't handle total 'what the heck!!! this is just bizaare! but silly! type of ;movies this isn't for you.

2246326,5,B0007WFXTE,"For me, Freaked is one of those movies you see once and can never forget it. The first time I saw this, it was the summer of 1994. I was eight years old and my parents still had HBO at the time. Years of wanting it finally culminated in purchasing it on Amazon earlier this year. After 17 years I finally got to see it again.

I still enjoyed it a lot.

Freaked is stars Alex Winter playing Ricky Coogin, a former child star now representing the company ""Everything Except Shoes"" and their product Zygrot 24, a controversial toxic fertilizer. His first job is to travel to South America with his best friend, Ernie, where they ultimately meet up with a protester named Julie and Elijah Skuggs, who runs a freak show. As it turns out, Skuggs is using Zygrot-24 to turn normal people into literal freaks for his freak show and does the same to the three characters.

The trio, and most of the other freaks, soon begin to try to find a way to stop Skuggs from his plans and escape all the while a boy named Stuey, who is Rick's biggest fan, tries to find him and save him.

The movie is a very off-the-wall wacky kind of movie. Self-aware jokes, puns, and references sprinkle the movie. It's not a movie meant to be taken very seriously. The makeup of the freaks is very well done. The acting is pretty good.

This movie is a movie I consider to be a textbook example of what a ""cult following"" or ""cult classic"" movie is. If you're in the mood for something slightly less than mainstream and not your run-of-the-mill style Hollywood movie with random off the wall humor, this would be a great start.",1312934400,,1597,4.381756756756757

Freaked is not really an Airplane or Hot Shots style parody.  The people who made Airplane and Hot Shots knew exactly what they were going to parody and the audience knew it too.

If freaked is a parody I don't have a clue as to what Freaked parodies

Freaked is more of a gaudy conglomeration of the original 1950s Mad Comic Book, The Three Stooges, Dr Cyclops (with freaks instead of tiny people), The Island of Lost Souls, the original Todd Browning movie Freaks and fart humor.

On one hand Freaked has no redeeming value - you can't believe the script got a studio green light or that anyone even wrote it for that matter.  Whoever sold the idea for Freaked was very talented salesman!

You wonder about the actors - did any of them possibly think this was going help and not hurt their careers.

Freaked has so many things that makes a movie bad - it looks cheap and expensive at the same time, it's dumb, stupid and inane. Did I say inane?  Inane does not begin to cover it.  The script is exactly what you would expect from a group of very very immature 8 year boys.  It will numb your brain and make your eyes crossed and by that fact alone Freaked should merit a 1 star rating.

But then...on the other hand...the freakn' movie made me laugh...a whole lot...and I kind of liked the idiotic characters and the extraordinary freak makeup the ultra garbage pail kid trading card like creatures and the whole bizarre, ""I can't believe what I'm seeing"" type of the thing.  So I added on some freakn' stars - so like 3 999/1000 stars - but you can't do 999/1000 stars and I'm not going to give Freaked 4 stars...just on principle...I've got my reputation you know.

So who is Freaked for?  Id say for no one except the most silly, shallow, near do well, IQ impaired, juvenile minded, Beverly Hillbilly watching, consumer - I don't think I'm one of those...At least I hope not...But  I must admit...I did find the movie to be...rather...er...funny.

I admit that you see about 50% of the jokes coming and most of those don't work... but that leaves about 50% that do and that equates to allot of laugh out loud jokes.

So - kudos to Randy Quaid who showed true girt and never held back in bringing his ""mad freak maker Elijah"" to life, and to a very good sport and lovely actress Megan Ward as a ""human rights activist"" who solves disputes with Moe Howard violence (I particularly enjoyed this for some strange reason.)  And to every actor who read the freakn' Freaked script, and threw caution (and careers) to the wind and did it anyway - I leave no one out.  And to the good (and odd) folks that were responsible for making me laugh in spite of my better judgment. By the way, that's a freeky feeling in itself.

Highlights?  Woody Wood Pecker and Curly wild life jungle sound affects.  Seeing an ultra homely kid fall from a 747, miss a hay stack and then get beaned in the head, Siamese twins fighting over deodorant, Larry Bud Melman chastising the audience...twice, Gumby and Pokey cameos(they will surely go blind for their behavior) Alex Winter in incredible make-up with his mouth hanging wide open for the entire film with constant spittle dripping which was most surely his own, a pin head song sung from the diaphragm, an overly excitable sock head, and of course Mr. T's make-up tips. Autumn coloring hah hah hah!  (how in the world did they get Mr T to play this role - and completely seriously too. Mr T - thank you so so much)

Damn this stupid movie was so freakn' funny.

2246332,2,B0007WFXTE,"...because as important as sidekicks are, nobody comes to see them specifically.  This film is full of people who are best known for being sidekicks.  Not surprisingly, I found ""Freaked"" completely by accident.  Some accidents are happy.  Some accidents are sad.  Some accidents make you angry enough that you want to start a fire and melt polycarbonate.  ""Freaked"" might make an entertaining fire.  A film almost entirely populated by (in)famous sidekick actors deserves to be this painfully bad.  But I should be fair and explain myself.  Nothing is all bad (well, maybe Hitler).  After all, a lot of people really liked this movie (about which I am honestly puzzled?).  So, let's break it down.  DA^^N THE AMAZON RANKINGS!!! CHARGE!!!

-TRYING HARD TO BE FUNNY.
I don't usually care who the actors are in a film as long as they pull it off.  Actually, sometimes knowing the actors can give the viewer negative preconceptions about a film.  I had no clue of who was in this movie.  Unfortunately, I found out quickly this was not a heaven-sent cast.  ""Freaked"" is a ""who's who"" of Hollywood sidekicks.  The reason they are sidekicks became obvious when I watched ""Freaked"".  Brook Shields is not a sidekick, but she was painfully out of her element here.  Randy Quade (fully incapable of carrying a film on his own), Alex Winter (Bill minus Ted in a not-so-excellent adventure), Blossom's Brother (Mike something or other), Mr. T (minus ""A"" team), Morgan Fairchild (minus a meaningful role), Bob Goldthwait (do I need to say more?), Keanu Reaves (in a wisely uncredited role) and the rest of the cast (Who are traditionally bit players) tried really hard to achieve quirkiness but were not up to the task.  It was all played as a campy horror-esque spoof.  Unfortunately, when you try too hard to be campy you just look like you're trying too hard.  Everyone tried way too hard.  I guess if I had read this script, I'd be trying pretty hard to make it better too.  Unfortunately, when it comes to comedy; either you're funny or you're not despite the best efforts.

-""I WROTE A SCREENPLAY; NOW I'LL STAR IN IT!!""
Alex Winter (Bill of ""Bill and Ted"") was one of the writers and the ""star"" of this film.  I'm pretty sure he doesn't write a lot and I think that's a good thing.  He and his fellow writers really don't have a knack for this kind of ""Spoof"".  In fact, they really haven't written anything I could revere them for.  What they tried here was an ""Airplane"" like approach to gross-out horror comedy.  First; when you spoof a genre that's already funny or campy, you're inviting trouble.  Second; you really should have a cast that's good at lampooning or acting in general. The reason ""Airplane' worked so well is that they had these well established disaster genre actors playing a zany script straight.  ""Freaked"" took something inherently zany or nutty and tried to make it nuttier using actors that were already on the fringes of goofiness.  Why would you spoof a genre that's already disgustingly funny?  The attempt at being off-beat and quirky just came off flat and heartless.  Part of what makes gross-out films entertaining is the reactions of the characters to what ever craziness is occurring.  Here, the actors are practically blas&eacute; about outrageous events.  Some might find this quirky behavior hilarious; I found it to be blas&eacute;.  When the writers actually stumble onto something sublime and/or funny, they explain it to you and dumb it down, sucking your laughs away before you can use them.  You, the audience, are given no chance to get the joke yourself.  You are spoon-fed the joke.  This is a sure sign the writers had no confidence in their audience.  I'm no high-brow snob, but I did not laugh once at this film and actually came away feeling insulted.

-PRETENTIOUSLY OFFBEAT.
I think the word that would best describe a failed attempt at being off-beat would be ""Pretentious"".  If a film is obvious in its pretense, then it certainly can't be off-beat; it can only pretend to be off-beat.  This film has pretender written all over it.  ""Freaked"" is like a little sibling that wants to hang around with the big kids.  After laughing at the big kid jokes that they don't quite understand, they try to make jokes of their own.  Unfortunately they aren't mature enough to grasp the context in which the older kid's jokes were made.  Then you feel sorry for the little sibling for being embarrassingly inept at making the older kids laugh.  I found this film uncomfortably embarrassing and inept at trying to be an off-beat campy horror comedy spoof.

-IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE...
Here are some things that were mildly interesting about ""Freaked"":
-Some pretty interesting sets and makeup.  It was over the top, but done well enough.
-Decent stop-motion animation.  It's hard to make me hate a film with stop-motion in it.  This film managed to do that.
-If this story were written by more competent people, it would be an interesting concept.
-A very colorful film with lots of eye-candy and not a lot of CG.
-It has unique packaging (no text at all on the box; just pictures).  You get 2 discs and a multi-paged booklet.  Unfortunately, I don't really want to learn more about the movie after watching it.
-I got it cheap.

-WHAT DO I THINK OF THIS OBOMINATION?
If this review ever gets read, I'm sure many lovers of this film will stick it to me good.  I'm pretty sure the phrase ""You don't get it!"" will ring familiar.  That's all cool.  However, it is because I do get the humor of good spoofs that I can revile against this one.  I have friends who love this film, and all I can say in all honesty is that there is no accounting for taste.  I love the genre, just not this film.  Heck, I really like ""Kung Pow- Enter the Fist"" but completely understand why others don't.  I'll argue with anyone about this film as long as you keep it civil.
Thanks for reading and have a great day!!

2246333,4,B0007WFXTE,"Freaked is the answer to that old question, ""What ever happened to that Alex Winter guy?""  Granted he hasn't really done much since this, but he makes a rather impressive and memorable film as both lead actor and co-director.
I'm a bit surprised that more cult fans aren't aware of this film.  It's zany as all hell, has some notable actors and boasts some impressive creature FX.
Alex Winter is Ricky Coogan, a former child star and all around snotty jerk.  He agrees to be a spokesman in South America for a fertilizer called Zygrot-24.  When Coogan and his buddy land in South America and pick up a feisty activist, they find themselves at a freak emporium run by Elijah Skuggs(Randy Quaid in full whacko mode).  Skuggs uses the Zygrot-24 fertilizer to make the freaks he displays.  Coogan and his buddies become the latest victims.  Coogan's now the ""Beast Boy"", and becomes the star attraction.  He also becomes a kind of leader for the group that consists of The Bearded Lady(Mr. T), A living sock puppet(Bobcat Goldthwait), a literal Cow-Boy, an uncredited Keanu Reeves as the dog boy, and many more.  Coogan is pursued by a loud big eared boy who is his number one fan, who becomes instrumental in bringing down Skuggs and the evil corporate schmucks who want to change the human race with Zygrot-24.  The head of the corporation is played by the always reliable William Sadler.  The film is told through a series of flashbacks that Coogan is telling as a guest on a talk show hosted by Brooke Shields.
Needless to say, this movie is wacky, very wacky.  Very cartoonish and off the wall.  Some of the zany humor and kinetic camera techniques are quite prevalent now in movies and tv shows, but this was most likely ahead of it's time in 1993.  Too bad nobody watched it.
Alex Winter impresses and surprises as co writer and co director with his off the wall and quite quirky sense of humor.  He even spoof's himself by making Coogan the star of a series of films called, ""Ghost Dude"".  Winter must have had some kind of budget for this film considering how many actors he lured into it and the monster effects with are quite impressive.  Yes, they are obviously phony, but I think it's supposed to be to a certain degree anyway.  The Beast Boy makeup is quite good.
I'd highly recommend this if you haven't already seen it and could use a good laugh.  I only wish Winter would have continued on this path coz if this is a prime example of his film making talents, he could be one of the leading cult directors now.  Hope he makes another movie.",1213747200,7,2552,4.5548245614035086

2246335,5,B0007WFXTE,"Despite being one of the most overlooked and underpromoted films upon its release in 1993, most of the cult following for FREAKED never saw the film until much later. This hysterical debut feature from Tom Stern and Alex Winter began life with plenty of promise: a funny script, two talented up-and-coming comedy directors, a great ensemble cast, plenty of shock value, and even cross-promotion merchandising (HIDEOUS MUTANT FREEKZ action figures made their way to stores before the film's title was changed, and are now considered valuable collectors items).  However, the film was shuffled into obscurity thanks to a change in the corporate leadership of Twentieth Century Fox.  FREAKED had only a limited theatrical release and little fanfare when it finally hit home video.

  FREAKED is the tale of one-time child actor (and full time jerk), Ricky Coogan (Winter) who makes a Faustian deal with the EES (Everything Except Shoes) Corporation to promote a dangerous chemical fertilizer, Zygrot 23, in the South American country of Santa Flan.  Joined by his horn dog buddy Ernie (Michael Stoyanov) and perky environmentalist Julie (Megan Ward), the trio happen upon a freak show only to become part of the act thanks to the handiwork of evil Elijah C. Skuggs (Randy Quaid), a crazed ringmaster who creates new freaks using--what else--Zygrot 23.

  And that's just the first act of the film!  If you're at all familiar with Winter and Stern's earlier short films (SQUEAL OF DEATH), then you may have an inkling as to what a treat FREAKED is.  The humor is extremely twisted and the sight gags and jokes just keep coming.  Once transformed into freaks, Ricky, Ernie, and Julie befriend a cast of characters that include psychic trolls, Rastafarian eyeballs with legs, down-trodden wrenches, a giant worm, a woman played by Mr. T (playing himself, only female), and Bobcat Goldthwaite playing a freak with the body of a man but the head of a sock-pocket.  The freaks must band together to escape from Skuggs and stop the spread of Zygrot 23 before the world is overrun by more freaks.  The movie boasts cameos from Keanu Reeves, Brooke Shields, Morgan Fairchild, Butthole Surfers frontman Gibby Haines, and Calvert DeForest (AKA Larry ""Bud"" Melman).",1149120000,8,2250,5.078804347826087
2246336,5,B0007WFXTE,"Why do I give this movie five stars?  Because it is funny.  That's all.  I really liked it.  The story is bizarre, the writing the height of silliness, and the acting intentionally goofy.  It's also got a fair amount of gross out humor, which I usually don't enjoy.  But in this case I'm willing to make an exception.

There's some great extras as well, surprising for a low budget, forgotten film like this.  They're not all great, but they're still included.  That's pretty cool.

The favorite part for me is seeing William Sadler, Keanu Reeves, and Randy Quaid acting in this strange film.  Sadler as head of the EES corporation has perhaps the greatest evil line ever uttered by a ruthless bad guy.

Freaked is sort of a cross between Mad magazine, Monty Python, and Airplane.  It won't appeal to everyone, but it's still pretty damn funny after all these years.  Rent it before you buy it if you want to play it safe.",1137369600,3,922,4.5426829268292686

I have watched my VHS copy of this film so many times, that I am nervous every time I pop it in because I fear it will snap!  Yes, I like this film that much.

Freaked is a gem of an film that most people don't know about. If you are a fan of films like Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Shakes The Clown, Spaceballs, than you are going to love Freaked.  It's absolutely hilarious. Made in 1993, the film wasn't a huge success in the theaters, because it was simply too odd for a studio to know how to market.  But Freaked really found its legs on video. Of course it did!  From the team who brought us Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures, Freaked is a smart combination of a creature feature and a slapstick comedy.

The costumes and creature design for Freaked are unparalleled. With characters like Dog Boy (Keanu Reeves), and The Giant Nose, Toad, Sockhead (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Mr. T in drag as The Bearded Lady, the film is a visual delight.  The opening sequence is one of my favorite of all times.  A wild melting mayhem of stop motion photography, the title sequence pounds away to a driving Henry Rollins theme song that sets the tone of the film off just right.

I can not recommend this film enough.  It's fun, entertaining and will leave make you a fan like me.  Sit back... relax... and enjoy the FREAKshow...",1121040000,8,1441,4.355805243445693
2246347,5,B0007WFXTE,"Make no mistake, this is one of the funniest movies you'll ever see.  The timing and the ridiculousness of bringing puns to life and absolutely dwarfing horrendous situations is unmatched in any film I've seen before or since.

Alex Winter (the less commercially successful half of Bill and Ted) co-wrote and directed this outrageous comedy about a conceited Hollywood prettyboy named Ricky Coogan who tries to woo a gorgeous environmental activist (played by CPU's Megan Ward) with the help of his best friend and all three end up transformed by radioactive waste into freaks for a sideshow run by an evil Randy Quaid.  Mr. T plays the bearded lady in a role even more surprising than Benicio Del Toro's stint as The Dog-Faced Boy in Big-Top Pee Wee.  Brooke Shields plays the talk show host who recounts the life of the ill-fated Coogan and his crew.

I can't justify my only grievance with this film, which would be that it has poor video and audio quality, because the only copy I own of this is a 3rd-generation VHS.  I'm sure the DVD will be remarkably better.

I haven't seen this movie in a few years, but decided to write a review solely on the excitement I felt after learning it's being released on DVD next week.  Check this out, it's brilliant!!!",1120608000,7,1259,4.665158371040724
2246348,5,B0007WFXTE,"In 1993, there was a changing of the guard at 20th Century Fox and one of the film casualties was a little gem called ""Freaked"" (aka ""Hideous Mutant Freekz"").  I recall the film being released in one theater in L.A. (the Laemmle Sunset 5 in West Hollywood) and it lasted maybe a week.  Entertainment Weekly voted it one of the 10 best videos to be released that year.  Thanks to HBO, it has become a minor cult-classic and deservedly so.

If you haven't heard the plot, here goes... Ricky Coogin (Alex Winter), a former child star of the TV series ""Baker's Dozen"" and the film ""Ghost Dude"", has been tapped to be a spokesman for EES (Everything Except Shoes) to promote an experimental fertilizer called Zygrot-24, which has been banned in the U.S. and Europe.  Coogin and his sexist buddy Ernie (Michael Stoyanov, ""Blossom"") travel to Santa Flan (named for the patron saint of creamy desserts), where they meet up with feminist protester Julie (the very lovely Megan Ward, ""Encino Man"").  The three stumble across Freek World, run by Elijah C. Skuggs (played to perfection by Randy Quaid).  Skuggs, as it turns out, is a mad scientist who has been using Zygrot-24 to create freaks for his sideshow (played by Keanu Reeves, Mr. T and Bob Goldthwait, to name a few).

I don't want to give too much away.  This is one of those films that you'll either love or hate.  I will say that there are constant sight gags, so many that required viewing is almost required to catch them all.

It has always been my wish that this film would one day be discovered.  Here's hoping that Anchor Bay promotes the hell out of it.",1116806400,12,1611,4.574912891986063

2246350,5,B0007WFXTE,"This is a movie that will live on in cult status for years only to be discovered by the masses decades from now. I'm pleased that this is the kind of humor that I find appealing and not the crapulence that makes up most mainstream ""comedies."" We all knew that this movie was funny as hell once we saw the wrench/hammer bit, but the moment the Machismo commercial was over I realized what a lucky (...) I was to be viewing this masterpiece. I can not convey the abject sense of loathing and contempt I feel towards the executives at Twentieth Century Fox for not having released this film on DVD. Do they have a pack of inept degenerates running the place? Perhaps their minds are as bent and twisted as their souls? Yes, that feels closer to the truth to me. I can see it now, a gang of roving sadists who delight in beating the retarded and telling people that if they vote it will somehow matter. Well well, we will see who gets their nipples twisted over this injustice my friends.

2246355,3,B0007WFXTE,"Sit this one in the row behind Citizen Kane and Casablanca, all you film [people], but don't deny it.  This movie is a riot.
I don't normally care for gross-out humor, but there is an underlying absurdist wit to FREAKED which never fails to elicit belly laughs from me.
Basically former child star Ricky Coogan (played by Alex Winter) and his best pal (the son who was an ambulance driver on Blossom) go to boofoo wherever at the behest of an evil corporation called E.E.S. -Everything Except Shoes- (in spite of the pleading of Stewy, this weird little fanboy of Ricky's who really does resemble a troll) who wants him to endorse their latest product.  They meet up with an activist minded gal and are promptly taken prisoner by evil sideshow barker Skuggs (Randy Quaid) who test the stuff on them, mutating Ricky into `Beast Boy' and merging the activist with Ricky's pal (the Blossom guy), who is a sexist pig.
The Funny is really unleashed when Skugg's other victims are introduced - a Man-Worm in desperate need of an...ahem...wiping, A bearded lady (played by Mr. T!), a dog-man (Keanu Reeves), a guy with a sock puppet for a head (Bobcat Goldthwait), Rosie The Eternal Flame (the guy who played the Dwarf in the Dungeons and Dragons movie - he runs around with a flame coming out of his [behind] for the whole picture here `Lights out baby!!!') a pinhead, and a wise Cowboy (part man part cow).  Particularly hilarious are the scenes where each of the characters tells how they wound up there in flashback fashion - Mr. T's story is the funniest, followed closely by the spoon who was mutated into a fork (or was it a hammer into a screw driver?  I forget).
Other high comedic moments:
The Rastafar-Eyes (`Eye `n Eye, mon...')
Skuggs in his 50's style rumpus room (`Styrofoam cup...')
`You're ugly enough to scare the pants off a dead nun' - followed by riotous laughter (from a nun) and general mayhem (machineguns, wrestling, a guy gets transfixed by an I LIKE IKE placard while Larry Bud Melman films it all with his super 8)
Brooke Shields growling with the voice of Randy Quaid `I'm going...to drink...your...blood!'
Well, the basic plot is beat E.E.S. and get back to normal by way of special macaroons, but in a movie like this, that's incidental.  This is one of those flicks that's right up there with Airplane, Top Secret, and Brain Donors.  If you like those movies, you'll probably find this pretty funny.  If you don't, or if you've never heard of any of them, stay away.  You'll hate this.",1050451200,13,2510,4.66289592760181

His best pal, Michael Stolchinoya  (sp?) from TV's ""Blossom"" and more importantly ""Mom &  Dad Save The World,"" and Megan Ward, all wind up mutated by evil  redneck carnival barker Elijah C. Skuggs (Randy Quaid), and join forces  with the bizarre cast of other mutations created by Skuggs. Watch for an  uncredited Keanu Reeves as Ortiz The Dog Boy.",967334400,4,802,5.1953125
2246358,5,B0007WFXTE,"This movie, from the makers of ""Ren and Stimpy"", is definitely worth watching for 2 reasons: it is absolutely hiliarious and you will NEVER see anything like this again in your life!
  Freaked is so  ""freaky"" you need a dictionary and thesaurus to describe it! Here  goes: absurdity, grotesque, outlandish, eccentric, bizarre, ridiculous,  strange, buffoonery, unique, jocose, off-the-wall, witty and wild- just to  name a few!
Some other movies that are similiar to Freaked are:  Beetlejuice, Weekend at Bernie's, Freeway, Claymation (TV specials), Alice  in Wonderland, Star Wars, Naked Gun, and 3 Stooges (TV).  But even compared  to all of these it is still completely different!
  This movie makes me  want to throw a ""freak"" costume party with a great prize (so that  everyone would dress up as ""freaky"" as possible. We might not all  get arrested if it was on Halloween!); and then all go into restaurants  eating and dancing, and just watch people scatter, scream, stare and laugh  at us all! OK, I'm getting a little bit carried away, but that is THE  POINT! LOOSEN UP AND GET FREAKY PEOPLE!
This movie speaks to me: it  says, ""Break the rules every once in awhile.  Do something new and  exciting! Don't let life mold you- shape and mold your own life the way YOU  want it to be! GO FOR IT!""
