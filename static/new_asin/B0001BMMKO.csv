8324801,5,B0001BMMKO,Good old fashioned synth music created by a classical composer.  Play it on Halloween and scare the crap out of the kids.  Great way to test your TV sound system!,1505001600,,162,4.366666666666666
8324802,5,B0001BMMKO,"I have disliked Silver Apples of the Moon for about 35 years now. I bought this volume on hearing some samples elsewhere, with low expectations.

But I really like it. Where Silver Apples (as remembered from the old stereo LP) was plinky plonky and uninvolving, here Sidewinder and Until Spring are exciting and involving. I don't know about the compositional aspect, but the performance aspect is brilliant.

The surround is really great: break out your supertweeters for Until Spring!

Volume 2 does not sound strange now, but it stands head and shoulders above most current electronica: I think most people with a patchable synthesizer would enjoy it tremendously, as would people wanting to give their surround systems a good run.  It makes me want to re-assess Silver Apples even.",1369094400,,785,5.062015503875969
