7002861,5,B00T83TLTQ,Great! Warner Baxter was a great actor. Many of these (especially the first) had above average writing and a fine supporting cast. Only one was average. All were quality. I highly recommend this.,1437264000,8,195,4.9393939393939394
7002862,5,B00T83TLTQ,"I am presently watching Crime Doctor.  Movies started off good and just keeps on getting better.  Great viewing.  I most definitely recommend.
17/6/15 - I have finished watching Crime Doctor, oh how I so wish there was more of these movies made.",1434153600,,245,4.785714285714286
7002863,5,B00T83TLTQ,"Criminal mastermind Phil Morgan is taken for a ride by his fellow crooks and his body is dumped by the roadside.
But they failed to bump him off.
Instead he hit his head and woke up with total amnesia.
He is taken to the hospital where he is cared for by a brilliant psychiatrist.
He resolves to go to medical school himself and become a psychiatrist.
Years later, he emerges as Dr. Matthew Ordway, The World's Greatest Psychiatrist, who has devoted his life to the study of the criminal mind.
Almost a super-hero, except he has no special powers outside of his intellect
(though he is able to hypnotize weak-minded criminals).

All  ten  B-Movies were produced by Columbia Pictures between 1943 and 1949, and starred one-time leading man Warner Baxter (42nd Street) as The Crime Doctor.
Warner Baxter was a bit older than your average B-Movie private eye, and a lot less physical (his stunt double gets a workout), but I always enjoyed the clever writing of these films.
The series has a preposterous premise, but it is very well-done.
The seventh entry in the series, ""Crime Doctor's Man-Hunt"" (1946), has a brilliant surprise ending that took me completely by surprise.
Great fun.

OnesMedia has produced the only available collection of all ten Crime Doctor movies, and is selling them at a very nice price.
Five DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).
Picture quality ranges from OK to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.
No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.
These are DVD-Rs, but I had no problem playing them.
Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.

GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD
A-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.
B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.
Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)

PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE
- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves. Still viewed with suspicion by the police.
- The Falcon has a shady past (never quite explained).
- Arsene Lupin is an unreformed jewel thief who sometimes helps the police if it serves his ends.
- The Crime Doctor used to be an Organized Crime Boss. He never actually reformed, but was conked over the head and woke up with amnesia.

PHILIP MARLOWE / SAM SPADE
These two detectives were the most famous Private Eyes of all time, but they don't really belong on this list.
They were A-Movie detectives all the way:
- 1931 The Maltese Falcon: Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade
- 1936 Satan Met a Lady: Warren William as Sam Spade - adapted from 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett
- 1941 The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade
- 1944 Murder, My Sweet: Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'Farewell, My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
- 1946 The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 Lady in the Lake: Robert Montgomery as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 The Brasher Doubloon: George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'The High Window"" by Raymond Chandler

But two Philip Marlowe novels were adapted as B-Movies for other detectives:
- 1942 Time to Kill (Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne) - adaptated from 'The High Window' by Raymond Chandler
- 1942 The Falcon Takes Over (George Sanders as The Falcon)) - adapted from 'Farewell My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler

7002873,4,B00T83TLTQ,"These are B movies, shot in plain meat-and-potatoes fashion--no elaborate set-ups or major action scenes, using a few simple sets and shadows to create little corners of the film noir world.  These aren't films noir, but mysteries starring a pre-Columbo investigator.  Warner Baxter's Dr. Ordway is quietly pushy as he digs into these convoluted little mysteries.  One of the best scenes has the camera remaining still throughout one scene, keeping the suspect, an artist, in the foreground as he works on a sculpture--while in the background, Ordway looks around and even leaves the room, knowing the artist will blab away while Ordway looks for evidence.  Baxter isn't flashy, he just keeps going--he's the Energizer Bunny of B detectives.

While these don't have elaborate production values the pacing never lags.  You'll see familiar faces (I won't spoil any except one: NIna Foch has a major role, and it's probably among her earliest), and even the limited use of sets works perfectly for the material.  My only complaints are that in maybe three scenes across ten movies, the night scenes are so dark it seems like Ordway has wandered into some lightless abyss, and that some of the plotting is so convoluted that by the end I didn't know or care if all the twists made sense.  (I'll have to keep focused the next time I watch the one with the guy whose wives both died--how we made the leap from that to [fake] vampires eluded me.)

The transfers are probably as good as these older films could be, and while I have to agree with some of the points made about them, I really have no complaints.  I'm not a techie, I can understand some distortion; I wouldn't recommend these to someone expecting pristine prints, but really, that's a non-issue for me--I don't watch these for technical excellence in the transfer, but to enjoy Baxter and his interaction with the casts of these films.

I've not described any of the plots because it was fun to come to them fresh.

I was very pleased with the fast service, and the discs were as-described.  I'll definitely be buying more from this company.

Warner Baxter was a big star in his day, and these were programmers shot quickly in his declining years. He comes across as Brian Donleavy's nicer brother.  These were just fun, and I got more than my money's worth.",1456876800,12,2315,4.7669172932330826

8700910,3,B00T83TLTQ,"Crime Doctor, 1943 film

A car drives along an empty highway, then a mans body is thrown out. Another car comes along and sees this man, then takes him to a hospital. Who is he? Dr. Carey removes the bandages from the mans eyes. He cant remember who he is! The nurses call him Ordway. His fingerprints will be checked by the police. No record found. Robert Ordway will try to cure himself. He attends classes in college, then graduates. [Kings County in Brooklyn.] He is a psychiatrist and has a patient. Later Ordway goes to a nightclub and meets a man. Who is Phil Morgan? Three men recognize Ordway from ten years ago. Ordway visits a prison, he treated prisoners. A new prisoner started trouble at the main gate.

Ordway talks to him. Captain Wheeler trains the prisoners with wooden rifles to pass an obstacle course. Robert Ordway is appointed head of the State Board of Parole. A woman prisoner recognizes Phil Morgan. A visitor comes to ask for advice; he acts mysteriously. Captain Wheeler is paroled. Pearl Adams applies for parole. What was her reason for applying? She calls Ordway Phil Morgan. Ordway goes to Frankies Bar to talk to those criminals. Can he remember his past? They talk about the valise. There is a fight in the dark. Ordway captures the criminals and the stolen payroll. They go to trial. Convicting Philip Morgan will convict innocent Robert Ordway. Guilty with a recommendation of clemency. Sentence suspended!

These stories are based on a radio program written by Mike Marcin, a popular series of that era. It claimed that a psychiatrist had a special skill to handle criminals! [Was this the inspiration for the later TV series Diagnosis Murder?]",1532649600,,1681,4.789655172413793
