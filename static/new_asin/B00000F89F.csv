1205383,5,B00000F89F,"Highly recomended.  A very well done, narrated and researched video.  Nearly 400 years ago there existed a South American indian tribe by the name of the Cogi in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta of Colombia who lived in peace for centuries.  With the onslaught of the Spanish Conquistadores they were nearly annihilated for no other reason than religious ones. After 400 years it was thought none of them had survived until recently, the Cogi sent a messenger down from the mountains with a message.  After the Conquistadores the few survivors retreated to the high mountains were they built highly intricate network of cities interwoven in the heart of the forest canopy.  There they farmed the land and have lived in total harmony with their surroundings without war, theft, or crime of any kind. They demonstrate the pocession of great wisdom and patience with the younger brothers - that is us.  The narration is a first person account, professionally shot and narrated in their city.",1124668800,21,988,4.957575757575758

For me this was a serious wake-up call. Imagine if people throughout the world had the same clear intention as the Kogi !!! I'd like to see this DVD in every school in the world. They are humble and totally mentally healthy human beings, who have their values spot on. If we, in industrial and consumerism-based societies, all adopted the role of Caring for Life in our own circumstances, the Earth would no longer be in danger for our children. Outstanding movie, beautifully filmed, too. Cummon, folks throughout the biosphere, let's all get down to Caring for Life on Earth, each in our own ways. Whether individual, family, town or corporation. Personally, as a highly educated Englishman, I'm living better than in any of my previous 5 decades since university, just because I now really LIVE what these humble people have been living as a matter of course for centuries. One of the world's truly great and important movies. DVD please. Then scatter it. Worldwide. Before it's too late. I'm serious. GT",1519516800,,1179,4.9296482412060305

7907307,5,B00000F89F,"Having heard this documentary mentioned on Link TV, I watched it online.  I'd love to have my own copy, preferably not an expensive, used, elderly VHS on the verge of disintegrating.  Anyone with an interest in learning from indigenous societies, with intact traditional knowledge and well-developed ways of living in harmonious relation to the natural world, can find things to value, here.",1362700800,7,391,5.290322580645161
7907308,5,B00000F89F,"My local library had this VHS 15 years ago. The context set in such a different
culture has challenged me to remain neutral. The message from ""The Elder Brothers""
however has become more important to current conditions in my culture.
  This VHS story needs to be available in DVD format. My grandchildren are ready
to learn about the challenges that lie ahead.",1345420800,3,360,4.790322580645161

In the mean time, the vid is posted on google as ""Cultural Anthropology, Ecology - The Kogi; ""The elder brothers' warning"". This needs reissued!",1217635200,16,246,4.488888888888889
7907310,5,B00000F89F,"This film is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen in my life. It is about a tribe that lives in the high peaks of the sierra nevada mountain range in santa marta columbia. This tribe holds the origional wisdoms of nature, they practice an impeccable spiritual arts created to sustain harmony with the great creator mother earth. Even if you are not a spiritual person, the way that the shamans of this tribe...aka MAMA's speak will touch your heart and give you something so beautiful to take with you into your life...For those that are spiritual this film has the potential to connect you directly to perhaps what you have been inwardly seeking for a long time, which is a full harmonious connnection to the divine...HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended movie!!",1205712000,4,784,4.814814814814815

The message is one that NEEDS to be heard AND listened to!  The earth changes that come will make people wish they had gotten the message earlier.",1173916800,19,265,4.28
