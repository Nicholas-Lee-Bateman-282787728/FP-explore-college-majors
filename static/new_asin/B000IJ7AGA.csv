8145932,5,B000IJ7AGA,"I bought this particular disc for the ""bonus feature"", DOA, after hearing that the transfer was the best available of the numerous available in the public domain. No complaints there - the picture quality and sound is better than I expected. If you haven't seen DOA, it's an excellent '50s - era thriller with an amazingly good performance by Edmond O'Brien.

The other ""main feature"" starring Frank Sinatra is still watchable, too. It's not a classic, like DOA, though.

I've already watched DOA three times and expect it will be in frequent rotation on my DVD player.",1223424000,,569,4.855670103092783
8145933,5,B000IJ7AGA,"I purchased this dvd for ""D.O.A."" only.

Suddenly

""Suddenly"" is a decent movie, but not one
that I would purchase separately.
A pretty good psycho-killer performance
by Frank Sinatra invading the idyllic
1950's American small town to assassinate
the President of the United States.

D.O.A.

After some character development that is essential
and never boring, this movie is relentless.
The brilliant film noir imagery, the constant action,
excellent performances and over-the-top score
puts the so-called action genre films of today to shame.
It is obvious that technological advancement
does not great art make.

Why aren't there more films in black and white?

The plot is awesome.

As soon as the opening credits and Frank Bigelow's
long, pounding death march to the
Police Dept. Homocide Division office ends,
he reports a murder. His own!

Then we learn the story, in flashback,
of how he hunted down his murderer
with the short time that he had left
and dealt with his imminent death
and the regrets that it gives rise to.

The video and audio quality are excellent.
I've seen this movie many times over the years,
but it never looked this good.
Not widescreen though.
Perhaps there is no widescreen copy available.
Too bad.",1191628800,3,1231,5.024630541871921
8145934,5,B000IJ7AGA,"Marengo Films is proud to announce the release of these two fine movies. Both prints were put through an extensive sound design and color correction. We guarantee these are the two finest prints of these movies on the market.

Suddenly a Sinatra classic is presented in LETTERBOX format. DOA is presented in crisp black and white in a superbly restored print.",1165881600,2,359,4.885245901639344
