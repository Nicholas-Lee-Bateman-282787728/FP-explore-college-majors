8446886,4,B004XEEMBC,"These 5 films represent Alan Berliner's feature output from his first ""The Family Album"" to his 5th ""Wide Awake"" (2006).

The highly talented Berliner makes short (4 of the 5 films are about 60 minutes), odd, often very funny documentaries
examining family, identity and creativity. He is very much a character in his own films, in the manner of, for example,
Ross McElwee (Sherman's March), as are his family members.

My 'film diary' notes on the 5 films;

The Family Album (1986) An interesting 60 minute experiment. Berliner combines clips from home movies mostly bought at flea
markets and other anonymous sources covering the 1920s through the 1950s. He combines these with home sound recordings,
some of his own family, some strangers' tapes found at yard sales; oral histories, kids goofing around with a recorder, recordings
of weddings, birthdays and funerals. Berliner arranges these clips, sound and vision so they follow life from infancy to old age,
the soundtrack tantalizingly close to fitting the images, but never quite fully matching up, since, in reality one had nothing to do
with the other. It's a touching document of how families would like to present themselves, would like to be remembered
(Berliner readily admits home movies are far from 'true' but represent idealized selves). I ultimately found the film affecting, if
perhaps a bit repetitive.

Intimate Stranger (1991) An interesting character study of the film-maker's maternal grandfather. The man was a stranger not only
to his grandson, but even it seems to those who knew him well. A Jewish man from Egypt, he seemed to feel most at home in the
world with his Japanese business partners. Comprised almost entirely of old home movies and still photos, with overlaid voice overs
of family and friends, it is a portrait an enigma; beloved by his business associates, but resented by his family, who felt ignored and
forgotten. Autocratic at home, gregarious while playing at being a diplomat. And maybe even a little crazy. Beautifully made, it gets us
deeply involved in the riddle of a total stranger, even if it always stays, like the man, slightly distanced.

Nobody's Business (1996) The strongest and most affecting of Alan Berliner's impressive list of quirky, personal documentaries to date.
This study of his cantankerous, difficult, if also very bright (and buried under the surface, quite human) father is both very funny and
sometimes very sad. Berliner captures perfectly the buttons that parents push in children and vice-versa as their interviews together
often turn into angry verbal sparring matches. And yet, by the end of the film, you can feel how much the gap between the two men
has narrowed through the process, and that Berliner is left with more love and less anger and confusion about the man who raised him.
A very personal document, that paradoxically becomes more universal for daring to be so intimate and real.

The Sweetest Sound (2001) Alan Berliner continues to make some of the most quirky, interesting and personal documentaries around,
often bringing a great deal of humor to what could be over-serious material. Here, he examines the meaning and value of one's own
name, and the strange reality that almost all of us share our names, a key part of our sense of identity, with many others. As part of
this exploration, Berliner invites all the ""Alan Berliner""s he can find to a dinner, and ends up with 13 namesakes at one meal, including
the French filmmaker Alain Berliner, who made the much acclaimed ""Ma Vie En Rose"", which the documentary film-maker got sick of being
congratulated for. This is a fun film, but one that also provokes deeper thought about the meaning of names and identity.

Wide Awake (2006) Another of Alan Berliner's quirky, funny, but thoughtful and enlightening documentaries. This one chronicles his
attempts to find an answer for his insomnia, and examines whether his tendency to be a night owl is a problem that keeps him out
of sync with the world and his family, or a harmless quirk of personality that helps him be creative. The film manages to convey a good
deal of scientific information about sleep and sleep rhythms, but Berliner's wry, very personal telling keeps it from ever feeling dry or
purely informational. As someone who is a night owl myself, I found this fascinating, sometimes a bit sad, and always entertaining.

Overall it's a terrific set, and I'm very glad to have it, although I also found it a bit pricy for 5 hour length films.  But if it supports
a true independent spirit like Berliner, it's worth it.",1373241600,,4579,4.951822916666667
8446887,5,B004XEEMBC,"Alan Berliner, whose 5-DVD compendium was quietly released at the end of the summer, specializes in making family life strange. In Nobody's Business, the most lively of the films in this collection, Berliner searches for the meaning of family ties through confrontational, funny, and ultimately sympathetic interviews with his father. He starts by showing his father pictures of long-dead relatives, whose reactions range from ambivalence to outright disgust. In one famous scene, he transposes footage of a boxing match over he and his father's rhetorical rug-of-war. Alan Berliner seeks understanding - how can he feel so strongly about a past that his father doesn't care about - but gets dragged down into the turmoil of emotions that lie just beneath the surface of any father-son relationship. The cover transposes his head and his father's, eliciting a question: who are these people who look so alike?

His father feels strongly about his grand-daughter, while belittling his grandfather as simply an ""old jew."" Alan's shrewd observations about this irony are seen as laughably dull to his father. Thankfully, Alan's search for meaning never reduces his father into a simple curmudgeon or a walking one-liner. By the end, he gives the film over to the rhythm of his father's daily life and his struggles with the growing distance with his family due to age and infirmities. His father's frustrations with Alan's probing search also say much about the qualities that they share. The conclusion of Nobody's Business can only be described that the meaning of family is personal and exists only in the now. As much as Alan is driven by persistent questions about long-dead relatives who whisper possible truths, they don't offer comfort. They aren't, like his father, able to speak to him to find that common ground.

Intimate Stranger follows another puzzling masculine family member, Joseph Cassuto, Alan's maternal grandfather. He was a savvy businessman, and moved to Japan after the second world war to capitalize on the import/export trade, while his family moved to New York City to live. Cassuto became increasingly infatuated with eastern culture while turning into an enigma to his wife and children. The title refers to how he supported his business partners (relative strangers) while ignoring his family. Berliner tries to make sense of the emotional jigsaw, the mystery of this man. Was he negligent or emotionally generous? It depends on who you ask. He has a ""good name"" because of his reputation in Japan, but not to his own children. Later, in The Sweetest Sound, Berliner takes his obsession with names to its logical extreme, inviting all the Alan Berliners to a room for a conversation. This film, while lively, is the most simplistic and ultimately lacks the depth and impact of the others.

For Berliner, the magic stuff of life, the way he makes sense of his reality, is family. Even Wide Awake, a film mostly about his insomnia, uses family as a recurring trope. ""I wonder if I'm wired this way"" he tells a doctor, after showing footage of himself tossing in bed, worrying about the upcoming birth of his child. It's a cliche to talk of filming as therapy, but his filmic style works much like memory: sympathetic, imperfect, and obsessive. The Family Album collages family films with different oral histories (often his own family's), creating a catalog of imagined histories that move from birth to death. It's an experimental film that connects ideas with images, manufacturing dialogues that question the nature of family memories. It shows families at their most unscripted and Berliner at his most meticulous.

Alan Berliner's magic is that he's able to transfer his curiosity about this fundamental unit of society through a pastiche of found footage and personal moments. He makes his films vibrant and fascinating by combining intimate moments with everyday scenes. The result is a depth that is unparalleled in most documentaries about family, particularly masculine family members, which tend to descend into cliche tropes.",1315699200,5,4063,5.151515151515151
