The Third Season of the incredibly popular Fraggle Rock TV show is finally out in stores, and if you have never seen or heard of the Fraggles, you must have been under a rock.  Along with the success of the Muppets, Jim Henson and company created the Fraggles, a world inhabited by doozers, Gorgs, and fraggles.

Doozers are small, but industrious.  Gorgs and big, hairy, and always entertaining.  Fraggles just do..they get in trouble, learn lessons, and hide from the human in the room.  Their adventures are amazing.  In their world bordered by the human and the Gorgs, Wembley, Red, Gobo, Mokey, Boober and Uncle Matt live and learn enthusiastically.

The Henson team created a rich tapestry like background for the series.  Brightly colored sets, amazing puppets, and characters that encouraged a child-like fascination with the outside world made this a global hit.  The five disc set includes all 24 episodes where Red finds a thief, Gobo gets the pebble pox, Wembley finds a bad genie, Gobo starts a school for explorers, the Gorgs fix their leaking roof, Gobo searches for the original doozer cave, the festivals of the bells goes off with a ring, and Wembley discovers carbonation.

In terms of special features, the set includes interviews and short documentaries on the cave of Fraggle Rock, the Trash heap, puppet design and operation, and a suitcase full of conceptual art.
The DVD's even make this set different, with preprinted pictures of the main characters on them, and episode summaries to the left of the disc.

Classy is only one way to describe this set.  Entertaining.  Well Designed.  These are classy productions that will(and do) enchant viewers of all ages.  Fraggle Rock was Henson at his peak.  No muppet/puppet fan should be without.

But will be saddened when all are released and no more to look forward to getting. The movie should be coming out after that.

After the great success of the first two seasons on DVD, Fraggle fans are very excited to see HIT Entertainment's commitment to this legendary series carry on.

The third, penultimate season of Fraggle Rock continues with the wonderful stories, performances, music and magic that made the series a landmark in children's television. Many unforgettable episodes are found in the third season, including ""The Secret Society of Poobahs,"" ""Gobo's School for Explorers,"" ""Scared Silly,"" ""Born to Wander,"" ""Playing Till It Hurts,"" ""Gunge the Great and Glorious,"" ""Sprocket's Big Adventure"" and ""Wembley's Wonderful Whoopie Water."" And it all starts off with the beautiful Christmas episode ""The Bells of Fraggle Rock.""

Aside from all 24 outstanding episodes, we will again be treated to a satisfying bonus disc full of all-new material. For the third time, the cast and crew of Fraggle Rock will provide us with new interviews detailing their experiences working on the show. New interviewees include workshop supervisor Tim Miller, series designer Michael K. Frith and puppeteer Kathy Mullen (Mokey Fraggle and Cotterpin Doozer). Individual features include ""Under Construction,"" ""The Puppet Collection,"" ""The Hall of Fame,"" ""The Hall of Fraggles,"" ""The Fraggleterium"" and ""Fraggle Gardens."" Also for the third time, we are presented with a marvelous facsimile of production work: included is a compilation of more than 50 of Michael K. Frith's original artwork sketches. The delightful packaging from the first two seasons (a full colored, glossy, embossed ""book-style"" box with turning pages) should also continue for this set.

HIT Entertainment's fantastic treatment of this series has been received with praise and joy from fans everywhere and no doubt continues in this third installment. With only the fourth season left to be issued on DVD (most likely in 2008) and with a new 3-CD box set of Fraggle music planned to release conjunctionally with this DVD collection in the fall, never has there been a better time to be a fan of one of Jim Henson's greatest and most beloved works.

You get what you'd expect from any TV season on DVD. All the episodes and a few extras. The focus is on the episodes though.

You won't be unhappy with the quality. And the box is a nice sturdy contruction so it'll hold up to kids playing with it.",1398124800,,441,4.057471264367816

2874351,5,B000RPOCK2,"I remember watching Fraggle Rock on the CBC when I was a kid.  A few years ago my dad bought the complete first season on DVD.  Eventually I got around to buying the rest of the sets so I now have the complete season.  Unlike the first two seasons I don't really remember much about seasons three and four, since I was starting to grow out of Fraggle Rock at the time, so I didn't have as much of a nostalgia filter for this season as the first two, but I didn't make watching it any less enjoyable.  There are many great episodes here:  ""Gobo's School for Explorers"" and ""Wembley and the Mean Genie"" I knew because I had the comic book adaptions of those episodes, so it was great to see the original versions.  ""Sprocket's Big Adventure"" was another great one because it was nice to see him finally discover what's behind that hole in the wall.

The special features are pretty good, though I must admit it feels a bit of a let down that half of them are just old HBO promos for episodes.  I guess they were starting to run out of bonus material.  All in all, it's a good collection and a definite must for any Fraggle/Muppets/Jim Henson fan.",1367712000,,1144,4.308411214953271

What is satisfying beyond the show itself, though, is the continuation of some of my favorite packaging. The dvd box set itself is very nicely put together (though I probably wouldn't let a child play with it, as it IS cardboard!) and the colors and design rich and are a great addition to my shelf. And, of course, it comes again with a little ""booklet surprise"" which in this season is a miniature version of the sketchbook that some of the ideas for the show sprung from. I always look forward to these every season because the presentation of these books that accompany them are amazing in their own right, and shed some interesting light on the making of the show.
