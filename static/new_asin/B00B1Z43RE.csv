5552695,4,B00B1Z43RE,Thought there would be lots more exercises although they are adequate to do time after time. For the entire package it seemed slim in number of exercises but having done them I do feel better on course strength wise and will continue to do them.,1376265600,13,245,4.466666666666667

8561185,3,B00B1Z43RE,"If you are fit at all, and have been around the game for awhile, then this will probably be way too rudimentary. I was disappointed since I have a lot of respect for him based on interviews / videos where he gives really helpful pointers. If you do not regularly exercise or stretch at all then this should definitely help your game, otherwise you may want to look elsewhere. I'm over 40 but relatively fit, and went through the videos once and that was enough for me. I found one of the band exercises helpful but can't remember what it was now. I will just stick to my existing workout / stretching schedule and regular practice. Joey D does know his stuff, just make sure you fall in the demographic that this is intended for (relatively out of shape and/or a mid-high handicapper) or you will probably be disappointed. Also, the production quality is very low if you are used to Beachbody or other professionally produced exercise videos.",1398124800,10,942,4.613095238095238
8561186,5,B00B1Z43RE,"It provided what it claimed, results. Hitting the ball further, more solid. Great results. I highly recommend this product for everyone.",1395705600,3,136,5.523809523809524

8561188,4,B00B1Z43RE,"This DVD is a month long program to introduce the user to golf specific exercises that improve muscle/skeletal stability and balance during the golf swing.  I am a 43 year old, 3 handicap index and have utilized various functional weight training programs my entire life. I feel it does a very good job of connecting the exercises to the golf swing. The workouts are not physically taxing, nor are they designed to be (the goal is not to build muscle mass here, rather to stabilize the golf swing), however I have felt my swing balance and body awareness during the golf swing improve by performing the exercises.

Also note, this is stage 1 of his program. Upon completion of this month long introductory program he offers, at an additional cost, a personalized, three month (If I recall correctly.) training program based upon submitted swing video.

In summary, I am very pleased with my results thus far (I have just completed the month introductory cycle) and have felt a positive impact on my posture, balance and tempo during the golf swing. I have ordered his 2010 book in order to take the workout beyond the introductory stage.",1391299200,12,1137,4.790816326530612
8561189,5,B00B1Z43RE,"I have used Golf Body for over 20 days and find it easy to follow and fun to improve your range of motion and balance. Joey D really knows biomechanics and is a proponent of "" what you do on the right you do on the left"". His procedure will improve balance of your body. The concept seems so easy but to get the results you are looking for you must follow the Joey D guidelines. The viewer will enjoy watching the dedication and intensity Joey demonstrates as you learn his methods. There is so much to gain personally from using this video 3 times a week for 20 minutes. It is now part of my routine and I look forward to additional gains as time goes on.",1390435200,9,656,4.1328125
