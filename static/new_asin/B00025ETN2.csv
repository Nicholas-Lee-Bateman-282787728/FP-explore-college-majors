2063183,3,B00025ETN2,"They tried to connect too many things in this and then it was only a dream? Every guy is bad and every woman is powerful and for the truth. I'd be suspicious if it weren't for the boy who saved them at the end. When the Professor didn't die from the cobra bite, they bit off more than they could chew. Excuse the pun.",1466035200,,317,3.96875
2063184,4,B00025ETN2,A fun little Tomb Raider style movie with some really good martial arts in it. Don't expect a deep story just have fun with it.,1355875200,2,127,4.12

2063196,5,B00025ETN2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This was dubbed in English and there were no subtitles getting in the way, so I must have gotten a different version than some of the other reviewers.  The plot consists of a journey in search of a sword, with plenty of martial arts action, hostile natives, a giant snake, and betrayal(s). This was not the first time I've watched this movie, and probably not the last, either.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Oriental fantasy.",1471996800,3,475,4.698795180722891

8022459,3,B00025ETN2,"The buildup to this movie was incredible, and the payoff at the end was completely worth it.  However, I found the terracotta physics to be completely unrealistic, so I deduct two stars for that.",1487462400,,195,4.735294117647059

8022468,4,B00025ETN2,"Very enjoyable and entertaining supernatural fantasy in the tradition of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  High production values and a good story as usual from contemporary Chinese productions. And the special effects are just eye-poppingly good.  Well worth watching for an absorbing and entertaining evening of escape from reality.",1479254400,,328,5.673469387755102
