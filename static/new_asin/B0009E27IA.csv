2283540,5,B0009E27IA,Great movie and a quality production on DVD! The movie is about the healing of two hurting souls helping each other.,1350259200,,116,4.571428571428571
2283541,4,B0009E27IA,"Maury Chaykin is one of those great character actors whose face many people recognize and whose name remains unknown by most.  In Whale Music, he doesn't portray--he BECOMES--an obsessed musician, pursuing in an Ahab-ic way the sounds of whales, woven into a symphony the sounds of which only he can imagine.  All alone in his mansion-by-the-sea, he lives a life of wealthy solitude, until a young woman walks into his life and opens him to new emotions and experiences.  Beautifully written, beautifully photographed, and beautifully acted, this movie can't help but move any viewer.",1231027200,5,584,5.191489361702128
2283542,3,B0009E27IA,"I think Maury Chaykin is a great actor and he was great in this.  Not sure why I was disappointed but I was - well, I confess I was expecting to see more out of Paul Gross, who plays the dead brother (what was I thinking??)  Oh, well, got a good price (check further down on the list, there's a cheaper DVD made for the States' DVD players).  I also thought the music was corny.  Sorry.",1166745600,3,386,4.0394736842105265
2283543,5,B0009E27IA,"This little Canadian film features a well written script (by Award winning writer Paul Quarrington), great acting by Maury Chaykin and Cyndy Preston, as well as Paul Gross.  Other staples of Canadian cinema and TV such as Jennifer Dale (ENG), Jim Bynes (Wiseguy, Highlander) and Kenneth Welsh (Twin Peaks) appear. The music by Rheostatics (one of Canada's best bands) is amazing...the Rheostatics were asked to do the music and even had an earlier album called Whale Music (buy both CDs!).  Chakin's Brian Wilson type character is lovable and the scenery of British Columbia is breathaking.",1143072000,5,590,5.2
2283544,5,B0009E27IA,This is my favorite movie. Anyone who has gone thru the pain of losing someone & not being ready to give them up will understand.,1139356800,5,129,4.2
8059495,4,B0009E27IA,"A little slow, but interesting character, Des, struggling with mental health issues and meets a young woman with a traumatic past history.  Two of them grow to care about each other and appreciate how they each can bring some normalcy to their lives. The book would be an interesting read.",1524009600,,289,4.78
8059496,1,B0009E27IA,"This movie was, for me, weak, schmaltzy, and not believable.",1511568000,,60,5.1
8059497,5,B0009E27IA,Great movie - engaging characters,1509753600,,33,5.8
8059498,5,B0009E27IA,"The combination of Paul Quarrington's beautiful story and Maury Chaykin's giften genius as an actor makes this film exquisite. Marvelous dialogue and acting that never misses, and the sounds of the magnificent whales take it over the top. I love listening to this film as much as watching it.",1498694400,,292,4.979591836734694
8059499,4,B0009E27IA,Seen this movie as a kid and loved it. Tried to find it in stores as an adult and didn't have very good luck. Decided to try online and bam found it. Was super happy when it showed up in the mail and was even happier when it worked!! Love this movie!!!!,1423785600,,253,3.8846153846153846
8059500,3,B0009E27IA,"Was disappointed there wasn't more of Paul Gross in this. Maury Chaykin is a great actor, no doubt about it, but the whole story was a downer. Probably won't watch it again.",1407369600,,173,4.4375
8059501,5,B0009E27IA,"this movie is a piece of poetry set to the screen. Chaykin is a master and he is orbited by the lovely and talented Cynthia Preston who falls in love with him, his strange vision and universe.",1402617600,,192,4.216216216216216
8059502,4,B0009E27IA,"Whale Music is the unlikely story of the relationship that develops between a young woman with a bad history and an older man with a bad present.

Desmond Howl is a former rock star who, with his out-of-control brother Dan, enjoyed great fame and fortune in the world of rock n roll music.  After his wife and Dan betray him, after he becomes a recluse, after his brain has been stolen by too many years of drugs and alcohol, he works only in his basement recording studio.  For a variety of reasons, Des is obsessed with whales, and all of his compositions are a symphony devoted to them.

Dess mental instability is complicated by the memory of his brothers sexual misconduct and his subsequent suicide.

Claire is a beautiful, troubled teenager on the run.  She breaks into Dess ramshackle old mansion to sleep and evade the law after escaping from an institution for the criminally insane.

Because these are two very complex characters, it seems wrong to define theirs as a conventional romantic relationship, but it is a caring one.  Each learns to offer the other the complete acceptance, emotional support and safety they both need.

This is no ordinary love story, and Maury Chaykin and Cyndy Preston perform admirably as two broken people.  Actually, Chaykins is probably one of the top-10 most brilliant performances Ive ever seen.  The anguished ghost of rocker Dan Howl is well-played by Paul Gross; his is a small part, but an important one, and a lesser actor might not have delivered so well.",1400976000,2,1508,4.783783783783784
8059503,5,B0009E27IA,"I bought this because Paul Gross was in it, but Maury Chaykin gave the jaw dropping performance here.  Very interesting movie.",1383436800,,126,5.0
8059504,5,B0009E27IA,"I love this film. It takes place in Canada. I saw it when it was first released many years ago, and still love it today.",1367107200,,120,3.84
