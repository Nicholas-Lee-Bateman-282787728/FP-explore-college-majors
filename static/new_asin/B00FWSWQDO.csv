6034465,4,B00FWSWQDO,"This was a great sports movie! It's not your ideal movie that most want to see about football, but it has a great message about life. Also, great movie to inspire everyone and show to your family.",1385424000,5,196,4.324324324324325
6034466,1,B00FWSWQDO,"I rented this thinking I would get half the emotion of Friday Night Lights. My wife walked away 15 minutes in. I watched it through to see if there was any redeeming quality later on. The writing is just so bad I was astonished this movie was green lighted. The editing was only slightly better, with a slo-mo ending moment that made me want my money back. No depth to the characters--I wanted to root for the inventor, but being one for 25 years I could not believe the clich's that didn't come close to realistic.

Save your time and money and pass on this one. Watch Friday Night Lights again and again.",1384646400,,606,4.3628318584070795

6034502,5,B00FWSWQDO,"Sports films are a dime a dozen. While the names, locations, and even the sport changes, the story rarely does, so what makes one film better than the rest? An eager young cast, a compelling back story, and a setting rarely seen before, all help Underdogs become that rare sports film that does more than just pump you up, it sticks with you and really makes you appreciate things that most people overlook. In Ohio, football is life, from the pros right down to the High School level and in the suburbs of Canton, Hoover is the name on everyone's bumper sticker, but they're not the only team in town. Across town is a division four team, the St. Thomas Aquinas Knights, a catholic school team that has never received any attention of any kind. Being a D4 team, even if they won all their games, they won't be going anywhere. The players, while talented are uninspired, until a new coach comes to town and makes them believe in themselves. The film is based on a true story and stars V's Logan Huffman as Quarterback, Bill Burkett. Huffman is always one of these guys you see in the background of a film and never really take notice of. In Underdogs, much like his character, Huffman steps up and really puts on a performance that I never would have expected. On and off the field the character being portrayed is so profound, that anyone would have a hard time making him believable. Not only does Logan Huffman do the impossible, but he does so in such a compelling way, that I added everything he's ever been in to my queue, once the film was over. Even though there is a lot more here than in your typical sports film, Huffman ties all the elements together, in a very special way, you seldom see anymore. To say his performance was legendary, truly does it a disservice. Even if you hate football, as a fan of movies, you should see this film just to witness the unbelievable performance of Logan Huffman, because he really was that good. As for the rest of the film, Underdogs was centered on football, but wasn't entirely about the team, it was also about the town, and how different one side can be from the other. The story of this town is almost as interesting as what's happening on the gridiron. Underdogs is a small budget, direct-to-video film, but much like the Knights, it packs a punch and really gives the big boys a run for their money.",1399939200,11,2356,4.481395348837209
6034503,3,B00FWSWQDO,"Good story line, the acting struggles throughout the movie though. The basis of the story is kind of cliche. A football team that has struggled for years all of a sudden becomes a championship contender.",1398902400,3,203,4.828571428571428
6034504,4,B00FWSWQDO,"This type of movie is not my usual forte. However, it was based on a true story and that always makes it interesting.  If you like this type of movie, you will like this one too.",1397606400,2,178,3.9444444444444446
6034505,2,B00FWSWQDO,"Michael Phillips, movie critic for the Chicago Tribune, noted of the movie ""Battle L.A."" that, though it is riddled with cliches, it still triumphed. He feels cliches can be efficient, and it's what you do with them that counts. In ""Underdog"" it's loaded with cliches and they're handled clumsily to the point of being painful.

Here's the scoop. Set in Ohio, the St. Thomas Aquinas High School football team gets a new football coach (D.B. Sweeney) to make winners of them. The star quarterback's dad works in the factory (and does assorted dog work) for the local rich factory owner. Dad invents a really great, but expensive, space heater. Can the team triumph? Can dad sell his idea and beat a lawsuit by his boss? I thought I would care.

This was just awful. You've seen this movie any number of times, and every version was probably better than this. And it fails on a few levels. First is the script. The set-up is common. ""Hoosiers,"" Remember the Titans"" et al all walked the same road with greater success. Here, the set ups are lame. The dialogue is simple-minded and you can see the end coming from the first act. Then there's the acting. The quarterback, Bobby Burkett, (Logan Huffman) is Okay but relies too much on his looks. His dad (William Maypother) is a stick of wood. He's a doormat for his boss and we're supposed to have sympathy for him because he stutters. Yes. I feel bad for him but he's spineless milqetoast. Thank God he had a good invention. He'd be totally useless otherwise. Much of the acting is fair to poor.

I simply could not believe how every aspect of this was mishandled. This might be a good family movie as long as the kids involved aren't old enough to see how awful this is. Other than that, see one of the better versions of this story.",1396483200,,1781,4.542056074766355
6034506,5,B00FWSWQDO,"I like football movies, so maybe I am biased, but this is a really good movie. Much more going on off the field than on the field.",1395532800,2,130,3.8518518518518516
6034507,5,B00FWSWQDO,I thought is was going to be all football but it wasn't. Great story line and not just one! Recommend it to all my friends.,1395014400,,123,3.96
6034508,2,B00FWSWQDO,"I thought it was a very good family movie, and had an interesting little twist at the end.  The downfall - the acting was extremely poor, even my grandson noticed.  It was a bit of a disappointment from that aspect.",1394668800,,215,4.35
6034509,5,B00FWSWQDO,"I thought it was a great storyline and I really like the acting of the main character played by Logan Huffman. I enjoyed Charlie Carver and also Richard Portnow. Richard is always good in everything that he does. Maddie Hasson also did an awesome job. I'm sure the budget for this movie was very low so Doug Dearth did a wonderful job with the finances he had and delivered an enjoyable movie. I plan on watching it over and over again. As an honorable mention, Ron Hulec nailed it taking the newspaper out of the dispenser and portraying disgust without saying word.  Logan Huffman being my favorite my next favorite are Ron Hulec and Rob Combest portrayal of a bar patron was moving.",1394668800,5,685,4.569105691056911

6034514,5,B00FWSWQDO,Underdogs is a well made movie that is suitable for the entire family. Two engaging  story lines and some unexpected turns. Definitely worth adding to your family's DVD library. This is the kind of movie you wish they made more of.,1389744000,,231,4.634146341463414

I didn't like the swearing. I'm not able to say it's a family movie for that reason, probably teens and up. It was a great story, and I loved the acting!

8619012,2,B00FWSWQDO,"Let me just tell you this. Although this movie is under the genre christian, it is actually not really christian. The actors compared to other sports movies were not that good. Also I would not recommend this movie.

8619015,5,B00FWSWQDO,"I enjoy sports movies, especially inspirational ones. The catholic high school in my hometown played Louisville St. Thomas Aquinas several times in the 1970's. They had a very strong program at that time. It was nice to discover the program had been revived.

Ohio is an economically diverse state. The story subtlely brought together many facets of the lives of most Ohioans - love of home, love of football, love of invention and innovation, and love of the American Dream. I very much enjoyed ""Broadway"" Joe Namath's appearence. His inspirational talk to the team - beating the odds in the face of adversity - was just spot on.

The writing was good, the cast was great, and the acting was very good. The best part is that the film is based on true stories and relatable to any of us ""underdogs"". I could watch this film hudreds of times and not tire of it.",1498348800,,860,4.577922077922078
