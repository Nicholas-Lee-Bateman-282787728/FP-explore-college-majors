8351836,3,B00264GB60,I doubt if Frances Durbridge would've approved this series! Bears hardly any resemblance to the radio series (which is absolutely excellent!). It was just a little difficult to really like the characters. I haven't watched the whole series yet. I hope it gets better!,1414713600,,267,5.090909090909091
