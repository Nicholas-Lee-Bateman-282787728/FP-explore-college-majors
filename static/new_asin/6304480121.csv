895272,1,6304480121,"The plot is slow and dull, even Anthony Hopkins can't bring it to life.  Additionally the quality of the DVD is unbelievably poor.  I can't believe any company would produce a DVD that looks and sounds as bad as this one.",1110067200,,221,4.365853658536586
895273,2,6304480121,"I found this film unique in that it really gave the sense that it was 1939...I mean it was almost as if the film had been made within twenty years of that time since the settings seemed so authentic.  I really felt as if this film was much older than it was...almost as if it were the first Arch of Triumph done in the 40's.

Slow moving film...without the depth of character development usually found in Hopkin's performances, but still you see the potential there.  I found his performance good--but stifled by a lack of room for him to express his brilliance and show the fine actor he is.

Having said that, his character does convey a tortuous array of emotions due to horrible experiences resulting in a need for justice, and a reluctance to open again to love...Hopkins conveys this psychological aspect well through his performance superbly...although the film did not provide him the opportunity to get as in depth as he often does in the majority of films I have viewed with him.

I would not recommend this film as highly as I would his other films, but again, it was most interesting to see an early performance...and the same voice, eyes, smile and ability to communicate without words that he is known for.",1044057600,9,1220,4.62962962962963

7873571,3,6304480121,"The liner notes for this disc claim it was digitally remastered for superior quality.  NOT SO!
I am a professional video engineer (retired) and recognize this as a simple transfer from a
flawed, multi-generation videotape.  It is soft in focus and has numerous artifacts, dropouts
and rolls from the creased videotape source.

If it were not such a cheap purchase price, I would return it.",1412553600,4,389,4.953846153846154
7873572,2,6304480121,"""Digitally Remastered for Superior Quality"" it says. I have a VHS of this. The DVD is worse in some places, better (only slightly) in others. Does anyone know where a better quality DVD can be obtained?

By the way, this version of the story is closer to the book than the Charles Boyer version, which is why I'd really like to find a cleaner copy.",1397865600,3,348,4.3538461538461535

7873574,4,6304480121,I already have this movie in VHS format and wanted a DVD version.  This is an old film and the quality of reproduction is not excellent but it is quite enjoyable and shows Anthony Hopkins in one of his earlier roles. I am well satisfied with my purchase and was very pleased and impressed to receive the film so quickly.  Thank you.,1302652800,,332,4.338709677419355
7873575,1,6304480121,"The original ""Arch of Triumph"" is in all respects better, but this was an honorable attempt at a remake, and I'd give it 3.5 stars but for the staggeringly poor quality of this DVD version. I have seen home transfers of videotapes to digital media that have looked and sounded better than this. The film deserved better, and so does the customer.",1290384000,3,346,4.596774193548387

7873577,3,6304480121,"In Paris, before the Nazis penetrate into the city, an Austrian refugee doctor falls in love with a mysterious woman. The 2nd World War isn't the best environment for romanticism ... Written by Kornel Osvart {kornelo@alphanet.hu}",1213228800,2,229,5.388888888888889
7873578,4,6304480121,"Arch of Triumph is based of the novel of the same title written by Eric Maria Remarque (who also wrote ""All Quiet of the Western Front"") There are no happy endings en Remarque's novels. The history is about a German doctor (played superbly by Anthony Hopkins), who is Christian but anti-nazi, and has sought refuge in France prior to September 1, 1939.
He is what the French call un sans-papier - an undocumented. France was already flooded by refugees from the defeated Spanish Republic. He is not allowed to work and if he is arrested, he will be dropped at the German border and pushed forward. Of course, if he goes back to Germany, he will end in a concentration camp. He knows it and does what he has to do in order to survive in France. He is viewed as an enemy by both the French and the Germans. In that quandary, he meets a suicidal French woman, a helpful French doctor, and a compasionate Zarist Russian exile. The movie ends as WWII begins.
If you want to watch a movie just to relax, this is not it; it  shows a cruel world. This is a movie with a message: that the price that war and prejudice exert on the individual is a high one.",1210896000,11,1147,4.310185185185185
