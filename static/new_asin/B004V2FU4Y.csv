Sri Devi and Poonam Dhillon are sisters in the movie, and are competetive. Poonam feels she always loses out and ends up killing herself in front of Sri Devi.

Later in the movie the plot really thickens. Vinod Khanna's 'Arjun' seems to be a good boy but nothing is as it seems. The clue to this movie is to keep your eye out for certain details, because they recur again later in the movie.

I actually found the ending scene where, Jackie Shroff as the police contable, gets shot, totally hilarious. You KNEW he would get shot long before, because, obviously, there can't be TWO ROMEOS, double Devdas.

It's a good movie, I'd rate it at seven out of ten. A nice thick plot, with a predictable ending and a little bit campy.",1383523200,,840,4.470588235294118
