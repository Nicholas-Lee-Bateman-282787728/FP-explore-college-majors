8018742,1,B0001Z64N6,DVD is in PAL format which will not play readily in the USA. Product did not list that it would be shipped from UK or I would not have ordered. Contacted seller who offered to refund if I sent back to UK from USA. More trouble than it is worth (will play on my laptop). This was the first and last time I will buy from Amazon instead of Ebay where description and shipping is displayed better.,1286150400,,393,4.116883116883117
8018743,4,B0001Z64N6,An entertaining film about three girlfriends that have had enough with their relationships back home and decide to go on vacation together.  They decide to return to a beach resort known as a destination for young people who are looking for flings.  Their plans for a dream holiday are placed on hold when they end up in a rundown motel with oversexed young adults.  Each is faced with temptation: the married woman with an eager young man; the career woman with a man who could ruin her; and the freshly divorced woman with an old flame.  The acting is very good even if the plot is predictable and thin at times.  The movie is purely for guilty pleasure viewing and rather like a Jackie Collins book in celloid. Great as long as you know what you are getting.,1158105600,2,761,4.4855072463768115
