8747499,5,B01AIX1NDG,What a wonderful DVD! I am a visual leaner and the notations on the screen really help. The Say it! Stomp it! Zill it! technique gets you practicing! I have almost every zill DVD on the market and this is an exceptional addition. A great purchase!,1456444800,2,247,4.391304347826087
8747500,5,B01AIX1NDG,"I am *so happy* to have finally found a DVD that will help me to remove the mental block I have when it comes to playing zills while dancing! Ustadza Azra treats finger cymbals as the musical instruments that they are. She breaks down several popular rhythms, including a breakdown of their *base* rhythms. I've never seen that done before. She also introduces a notation system for mapping out the rhythms of a song that enables its users *to create their own songs!!* It's really cool. This DVD will help dancers who want to learn to *move* with their zills and to better understand belly dance rhythms. It truly is for those who are new to zilling *and* for those who want to get more nuanced sounds from their finger cymbals by layering rhythms. I will be inspired/challenged by this one for a *long* time! :-)",1456358400,2,814,4.582191780821918
8747501,5,B01AIX1NDG,Unlike most of the other reviews I've done on cymbal DVD's this is a dancer I was not familiar with.  Probably as my main focus isn't on Tribal style dance.  If you have never danced with cymbals or are struggling with them this is a very good foundation.  She doesn't baby you but she does break down the basics in a very integrated way.  The only thing I missed was her lack of use of drum syllables but if you stick with this video you will be not only able to dance and play the cymbals; you'll have a deeper understanding of our music.,1456358400,2,540,4.163461538461538
