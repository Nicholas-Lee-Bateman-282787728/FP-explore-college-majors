7996135,5,B0000A5A34,"Francis Gary Powers was described 'an exceptional pilot, a fine photographer, and only incidentally a spy'. Yet he and an elite group of USAF pilots resigned their commissions to work for the CIA, flying Lockheed's high-altitude U-2 spy plane deep into then-Soviet airspace. The aircraft and the program were both born out of Cold War frustrations on the part of President Eisenhower's administration. Without unfiltered knowledge of Russian military programs and preparations, America's military planners didn't know what was (or wasn't) an over-reaction to Kremlin bombast. Aircraft designer 'Kelly' Johnson gave them a high-altitude, long-range reconnaissance vehicle, whose advanced cameras offered an unprecedented view of a 'closed' society from 70,000 feet.

It was only a matter of time before Soviet anti-aircraft missiles brought down a U-2---and blew the lid off the entire program. Powers survived the shoot-down, only to be placed on trial by Premier Nikita Khrushchev's regime as a propaganda coup. All of it is superbly documented in this film, narrated by the late Roy Scheider and containing once-secret film of U-2 test flights. It also allows the U-2's pilots to tell their story at last, bringing clarity and perspective to a long-ago crisis and a dangerous time. Recommended.",1347062400,,1296,5.48
7996136,5,B0000A5A34,"Next to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NOVA-Supersonic-Spies/dp/6305049025/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NOVA - ""Supersonic Spies,""</a>&nbsp;this is one of the best aviation documentaries ever produced by PBS. It does a marvelous job of describing the tenseness of the Cold War in the 1950s and President Eisenhower's attempts to gain accurate intelligence on the Soviet Union in order to avoid a costly and dangerous arms race, the impetus for building the U-2 in the first place.

The development of the U-2 is chronicled in just the right amount of detail using interviews with men from Lockheed's famous ""Skunk Works"" team, including some very amusing remarks from legendary test pilot Tony LeVier as well as pilots who flew the U-2 operationally. It is also partly a profile of Lockheed's equally legendary aircraft designer Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson.

The editing is very well done so that film footage and still photos intertwine nicely with the narration and interviews. The only technical flaw I could speak of is when an incident during U-2 testing forced a pilot to bail out (the U-2 had no ejection seats in those days) and was killed when struck by the aircraft is described. Footage of a pilot obviously strapped into a large ejection seat with very long rails is used.

The story ends with an in-depth recounting of the May 1960 incident in which pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down and captured, effectively ending U-2 overflights of the Soviet Union, though the U-2 would fly on from the Cuban Missile Crisis to Desert Storm.

As far as special features, there really aren't a whole lot; it provides ""accessibility"" to the PBS American Experience website, but unfortunately there are no pages for this episode there. Some may find the as-broadcast underwriters' spots annoying. Still, since the program content is (as far as I can tell) intact, I highly recommend this DVD to all my fellow aviation enthusiasts and history buffs.",1193616000,3,1990,5.348242811501597
