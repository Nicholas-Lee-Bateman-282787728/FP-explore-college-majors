7393644,3,B014GQ8118,"""I don't ask for names, but when someone kidnaps my father I ask questions."" Frank Martin (Skrein) is the best at what he does. He drives and delivers pacjages to where they need to go. No questions asked. When a job turns into something more dangerous Frank tries to back out, but when his father (Stevenson) is kidnapped things become personal. I will start by saying that I am a huge Jason Statham fan but was never a big fan of the Transporter series. When I head they were doing another one, without Statham I had reservations. I expected this to be another prequel or something along those lines. What this was was just another movie in the series, like Bond, new guy but continuing story and no reboot. All that said the movie itself was no better or worse than the others but it was missing one important aspect. Jason Statham. This guy did OK and really was a pretty good choice, but he seemed to try to hard to be tough and Statham-like and you can tell. The movie really isn't anything all that amazing and if you liked the others you will most likely like this one too but the lack of Statham was very apparent and the movie suffered a little because of it. Overall, a fine addition to the franchise, but again shows that if you can't get the original guy it may be a good idea to either wait or not do it at all. He didn't really add anything to the movie. I give this a B-.",1449187200,10,1387,4.257575757575758

This Transporter does a fine job as far as I'm concern.  I don't need the driver to be the same person to sill have fun with the ride.  Definitely liked it!!!!",1448841600,8,287,4.2407407407407405
7393647,3,B014GQ8118,"Frank Martin is back in The Transporter Refueled, but not Jason Statham. In the fourth feature film of the hit franchise Ed Skrein plays the role of the ex-special agent who is hired to transport anything to anywhere. Perhaps the new entry may not be as bad as you may be led to believe, but still a disappointment.

The story (set in South France) is nothing particularly new. Frank gets mixed up with violent gangsters led by Karasov (Radivoje Bukvic), when he accepts a job from a mysterious young woman to carry a package, which turns out to be something Frank did not expect.

What is unique about the film is that the screenplay focuses the relationship between Frank and his father, a retired secret agent played by Ray Stevenson. In fact, the comical interaction between the father and son, which reminds us of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, is more interesting than the convoluted main plot.

You get a handful of decent action sequences (which could have been better without the quick cuts), but my impression is simply this: So whats the point of making another Transporter film without Jason Statham?",1446076800,6,1117,4.77720207253886
7393648,1,B014GQ8118,"Its hand-to-hand fighting scenes look ridiculously fake.
The film is like a Mission Impossible movie with a female lead character. Unfortunately, when it was released on September 4, 2015, Mission Impossible  Rogue Nation was still in the theaters. Its far more superior to Transporter Refueled in every aspect such as acting, directing, stunts and cinematography.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are its financial figures as of Oct. 15, 2015:

Release date:  September 4, 2015
Production budget: $22 million (wikipedia.org)
Domestic grosses:  15,931,430
Foreign:  $17,000,00
Worldwide:  $32,931,430

So, in North America, it lost approximately 6 million dollars. That faithfully reflects how bad the film is.",1445126400,7,720,5.79047619047619
7393649,3,B014GQ8118,"The Transporter, Frank Martin (Ed Skrein) who never uses his real name, is contracted to transport some packages, and it only surprises him that the packages are humans (been there, done that, remember?). These are women who worked as prostitutes/escorts/hostesses for a crime boss (Radivoje Bukvic) and a number of smaller bosses, all who have millions. They devise a plan whereby they can get the money, wear Swedish Bikini Team blond wigs, and advertise Audi cars. This is not just an Audi, but one that can side swipe automobiles, hit fire hydrants and never have so much as superficial paint scratch.

The film is high octane, and needlessly so. I have noticed a trend to uses Audi automobiles as opposed to Jaguars for the cool car. In this film, there was a scene when Frank is being chased by the police, they swap cars....to a nearly identical Audi. What's the point? Dad (Ray Stevenson) manages to do an American Express commercial. I just feel like going out and buying an Audi and charging it on my AX card using my IPhone 5 (also prominently displayed a gazillion times).

The film is a reboot. Jason Statham wouldn't do it for less than $11 million, so we get Jason Statham lite, a man who arguably is a better actor, but not the box office draw. The movie takes place supposedly in 2010 yet (1995 + 15 years) uses later model I-Phones and Audis. The reboot throws at the audience all the gimmicks of a Transporter film, but it has very little substance. Stick a fork in it.

7393656,2,B014GQ8118,"This movie had way too many errors that I noticed. I've never written a movie review before and I'm not what I would consider a movie critic by any means. But there were a few things that stood out the most. Now I know in the past Transporter movies they've always used an Audi in them. Which is famous for having the Quattro system. Why on Earth would you make a movie with a car that has Quattro and disable it so that it's rear wheel drive? Use a BMW or Mercedes if you want the effects of a rear wheel drive car. Another one that irritated me was when he would press hard on the brake pedal and accelerate usually lighting up the rear tires only. Again, that car has all wheel drive. One of the scenes, forgot what time stamp it was but it was towards the beginning, he moves the shifter up towards reverse and moves forward. On the runway scene where the copilot gets taken out, spoiler alert, and leans forward bumping the throttles, is that not the longest full throttle ever without taking off? Yet to slow the plane down to a stop took only 2-3 seconds. I'm sure there was some other scenes that I have left out, but being a car guy those were the ones that I took the most notice to. The plot wasn't terrible and the acting seemed par for the course overall. If you're going to make a movie that is intended for the action/car chase scene genre do a better job at making it seem believable.",1506643200,,1400,4.227611940298507

So yeah It starts out great. Intriguing plot, with all the elements of a good heist flick.

The best part of course are the girls, who are just amazing. The movie felt like it was really bucking the trend of action flicks glorifying the man. These girls were in charge for a good part of the video. Even better, they were lesbians. Of course in the back of my mind, I thought ""oh no, lesbians always die in movies to make room for the male character."" but I pushed it out of my head and moved on with the movie.

A whole lot of great action scenes and other stuff later, well whaddya know. Romance starts to bud between the main (supposedly lesbian) female protagonist and the main male protagonist.

Sure it has everything the Statham ones did. Cars, damsel in distress, a simple transport that becomes all but. They recast the character, brought in his dad, AND completely ignored anything from the previous 3 movies.

Choreography is little compared to the others. They are using the modern style of ""more camera shots = more movement"" instead of actually focusing of the unique (and sometimes hilarious) fighting from the original 3.

I gave it 2 stars for the chase scenes (only thing that makes this worth it honestly). But the fighting, story, and new actor don't do the character justice.

They could have easily made him be someone the Jason Statham character trained to carry on his job. But no, they tried to completely recast the character as someone else and hope he can do it justice.

7393720,4,B014GQ8118,"Hey! Its that guy from Deadpool! Ed Skrein (Ajax, the main villain from Deadpool) steps in to take the wheel from series star Jason Statham. Skrein, playing Frank Martin, Jr., is our new transporter. Hes a highly skilled, not to mention highly punctual, delivery man with a penchant for picking up people who need help. Dad (Frank Martin, Sr.played by an almost swooshy, goofy but game Ray Stevenson) ends up coming along for the ride and getting junior in trouble. The Martins get taken in not by some bad guys but some bad girls, some ladies of the night who are casting shade at their former abusive employers, and these femme fatales play hard, play fast, and play tight. Oh, and they're also playing for keeps. The heroines in the transporter series haven't always been merely hapless but theyve never been as strong and out front as they are here giving Martin not just a hard time but a run for his money (and a little romance to boot). The movie, directed by Camille Delamarre (who also directed the painfully bad Brick Mansions), has all the bright sharp visual marks and crispness of another recent reboot, Hitman: Agent 47, which was pretty good and entertaining. So too The Transporter: Refueled. While Skrein doesnt have the same presence as Statham hes game for a slick shoe slice of action life. Its a little risqu for a PG-13 movie (parents take heed) but itll get you to your entertainment destination if you're willing to go along for the ride.",1489536000,,1462,4.692607003891051

As for this movie, I couldn't get into the plot.  It was so boring to me.  The plot dealt with the sex trade and what should have been a gripping topic, just fell flat for me. There was plenty of action though and the fight sequences were good and I did like the new lead, he definitely held his own.

I think TAKEN represented the sex trade better but I have no clue what really happens to those people that are kidnapped or sold into this world either. The  younger guy allowed for more family dynamics. The actors were cast well not horrible work, believable. The father and son match up seemed believable and added to the plot well.

So the femme fetal negotiates a deal, and then brakes the rules of the deal, but seemingly for no good reason. And to compel the transporter to do continue on helping them, holds his father 'hostage'. So why didn't she just provide the correct details up front, keeping the deal intact? If she was going to kidnap the father anyway to compel his cooperation, why not start the deal with the correct information for the ride and then after completion, force continued help via the kidnapped father? I am OK with plausible suspensions of disbelief, but the writer's need to meet me half way. The plot was thin and the directing and story were not well thought out.",1485129600,3,817,4.602739726027397

7394210,2,B014GQ8118,"Well....this wasn't a great movie imo.  Many of the action sequences and car chases were cool, but completely far fetched (Fast and Furious style).  I think what bugged me is that you have a character who is taken hostage repeatedly...over and over and over...and the character shouldn't be taken hostage given his background.  Because of this, Frank is constantly forced to do stupid crap. I don't want to spoil it but having to hear him say ""Now where's my father!?"" over and over in a threatening manner...when you know he isn't going to do anything...is just incredibly annoying.  This premise made a hard to watch film nearly unbearable. Not once do you feel as if the main character is doing anything of his own volition or has any control of what's happening...which is a huge departure from the original.  What a waste of a franchise.",1483833600,3,842,4.779310344827586

Formulaic instead of singular and surprising, the film was a slightly more expensive and expansive version of the TV series. I was never bored but I was also never blown away.

I can't say the acting was any better or worse than the earlier movies that started Jason Statham.  However, I think the plot twists were not as obvious in the earlier movies.

Really one of the biggest turn offs for me was not the script or the actors, but rather the beginning of movie felt more overtly like one long Audi commercial (may there be no doubt who helped fund the movie).  Just set the wrong tone for the movie and for that I rate this a 2 star.",1477180800,10,699,4.087591240875913

What a ditz if he at least didn't get something for all the loss and efforts. Jason Statham has nothing to worry about if the new Frank Martin ever
get's another Transport Job (sequel #4?).  I felt my time was wasted after watching Sequel #3- Refueled- and can't get the time back. Oh Well.....",1472774400,,584,4.533333333333333

The girl gets shot on the plane and once they're back at the hide out (abandoned warehouse), she makes a complete recovery after some witch doctor surgery including tweezers, sugar, and cobb webs. In the earlier part of the movie The Transporter ditches his black car after a police chase to avoid being recognized, but later in the movie gets chased by all kinds of police in his gray car and after eluding them he just drives around town the rest of the movie all willy nilly in the same gray car and never gets noticed by police. And as for as his 007 dad taxing an airplane one minute and doing surgery with tweezers and sugar the next. And who isn't suppose to notice that the latin hooker hanging with the gangster isn't the same black hooker hired by the gangster earlier in the movie.

7395877,3,B014GQ8118,This is a cartoon with humans in it. Highly entertaining nonsense. The stunts are great fun to watch even while you are aware that physics make most of them impossible. The plot line makes no sense - a damaged hooker with a heart of gold masterminds a plot to relieve her Russian gangster pimp and global criminal mastermind of his entire fortune and that of his two partners - we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars - AND do it in such a way that it looks like he stole all of his partners' millions while keeping his own. But the plot holes are so big they are really quite funny so you find yourself laughing and hooting at the ridiculousness while enjoying the action scenes at the same time. Lots of fun --- but nonsense.,1469923200,,733,4.397058823529412

It's totally unbelievable, but that's a whole genre in the mean time (can we say Fast and Furious?) and either you like that or not. I found the movie very entertaining in that context and certainly wasn't disappointed. I would recommend maybe not knowing the original movies from 10 years ago so you don't constantly draw comparisons helps - because what's the point? I'll be looking for those those now AFTER this one. And in the end, you have the give kudos here - this must be the most exciting commercial Audi ever made ;-)",1469836800,,716,4.774193548387097

He doesn't have quite the same hard brooding edge as his pedesessor but he makes up for it in youth and fluidity. For me these Transporter  movies are mildly entertaining movies that are almost comical in their absurdity ...and yet they can  draw you in and take you on a ride. Rule 1: leave expectations of realism or an immersive plot behind. Rule 2: enjoy some over the top action scenes reminiscent of martial arts movies, tied together with just enough story to keep it interesting. In this genre I tend to like Jason Statham as an actor, and really do love some of his other movies...but his departure from this series really didn't diminish it at all.

I admit it and I'm not ashamed even though I wish I could take back that 90 minutes and do something else. That's a silly wish since I'd probably pick something else for which I'd begrudge the time but this is my problem, not yours, reader. So, I'll tell you, watching this movie is like realizing that you're suddenly hungry and deciding to go to a pretty-looking fast food restaurant you've never been, ordering what looks like a standard menu item, eating it and then feeling later like you did eat something and it didn't kill you but you don't recall what exactly it was or how it tasted and it didn't give you a reason ever to go back but you remember part of the name of the place: it was ""Something Transporter,"" or ""Transporter Something.""

I watched this riding a stationary bike, and it was tolerable (barley) in that context. I got this free through Prime, which is good because I would have been bummed out had I actually paid money to see this lame reboot. The first Transporter movie was cultish, and was a really enjoyable watch; didn't take itself seriously, and the acting was so over the top it became a classic (IMHO). They did some interesting, Jackie Chan like things with the action scenes and music, and the French cop was marvelous. Transporter 2 had its moments, although it lacked the same B movie feel as the first movie, but certainly watchable. The third in the series was awful, and Statham wouldn't even come back after that. He's a smart man. My advice? If you're riding a bike and there's nothing else on and you don't feel like music, put on some music anyways. Not worth your time.",1466899200,,1022,4.6208791208791204

7397194,3,B014GQ8118,"Obviously the franchise is missing a little something when Jason Statham isn't in the role of Frank Martin.  He created the character and it's hard to imagine a Frank that isn't Jason.  On top of that some of the Transporter movies tend to be a little hit or miss on plot, but almost all of them deliver on action.  One of the best fight scenes I've ever held witness to was the jet fight scene in this franchise.

With that in mind this is actually a decent flick.  I wouldn't highly recommend it as a standalone movie, but on a bored afternoon or weekend if you're looking for a good action flick to sit down and spend a couple hours on you could do worse.  The integral role that Frank Martin's father plays in the movie is kind of fun and adds to it rather than taking away from the action/cheesiness.  It gives a little more credence to the character that you can see his past and his father being a spy is a big piece of what led him into this line of work and where he is.",1466035200,,979,4.148148148148148

There was also a scene at the end where the two main characters were fighting where the soft stunt flooring was totally able to be seen which I thought detracted from the final fight scene and made it more cheesy.

While it is not the original, it does pay due respect by maintaining the same unbelievable stunts and the original protagonist's cool-headedness.  Honestly, I don't put too much stock in any of the Transporter franchise whether movie or TV - they're all pretty silly.  And I've enjoyed most of them, because I just like a good action flick.  I have to admit that Dad getting kidnapped multiple times was a bit much, and the females' sad backgrounds difficult to believe.  Some of the plot development - moon shot, anyone?

And, the actor taking over the roll is, not just handsome, he's fun to watch. I also like that he gets rougher up a little. Not everything goes his way. I also liked watching the interplay between him and his father. He brought some down home fun and balanceto an otherwise too serious Frank. An even though I liked the boys, the girls were great to watch as well. All in all, it's a fun little night in. I recommend this movie.

The story pulled a few elements from the other movies but did not fit the story line of the series.

I am more concerned for the career of the actor playing the main character since he left game of thrones for this movie.

I love me some Ray Stevenson but one must ponder, ''How did he end up in this movie?''  Damn the money.  How about self-respect?!  The major slight is the lead actor: Ed Skrein.  No presence and/or charisma.  His fighting ability was quite laughable.  He is a beyond broke version of Jason Statham.  Chris Vance did a better job in the TV series than Ed Skrein here.  I couldn't help but notice that Ed Skrein was trying to audition for the James Bond role.  Welp!  If I were EON producers, I'd laugh real hard and be like... NEXT.

If Ed Skrein was playing a younger Transporter, why wasn't Francois Beleand the police inspector.  Oh, wait the movie is set in 2010 so perhaps he retired.  The film is a mess. The driving is boring, the fight scenes are lifeless with major continuity issues  Did I mention Frank Martin's dad ( Ray Stevenson) has basically a costar role.  It is silly.

Often movies today are filled with unrealistic stupid plot lines. There is just but one hero and some girl he tags a long with him. This movie is about the whole family. I absolutely think the cast, Father, Son, and 4 accomplice women out to take revenge is amazing. The Father/Son duo in this movie is off the chain and hilarious. SPOILER: a Secret Spy Father and Special Forces Son working together for the first growing a relationship unlike they have ever had before. The women in the movie are not some toys to be thrown around but truly bring a kick in the gut at the realities of sex, drugs and crime.

This (like many recent additions to Amazon Prime) was a pleasant surprise. I'm a Transporter 'newbie' so I really didn't have a clue about this movie, except for what the film cover communicated. This was an excellent movie for its genre: action. I'm not a big fan of spoilers so I won't go into much detail about the plot; however, I will tell you that the screenplay is great, with some thoughtful tongue-in-cheek moments. Both the men and the women play their parts well. Set in the French Riviera, the film also presented some breathtaking panoramas. Equally impressive was the driving. Car aficionados will appreciate Junior's Audi and the stunts that he completes. Finally, self defense fans will enjoy some well-done martial-arts maneuvers.

That said, it's almost as good as Transporter 1, and better than the two sequels to that flick.  'Refueled' is much more of a classic 'Bond' kind of movie than the initial three Transporter flicks, and it works quite well.  I liked it, and will watch any sequels (being an optimistic person).  My only complaint: in this flick, they continue with Audis (here, an S8) rather than a BMW E38 753 (or successor), as in the first flick ... and I still prefer Beemers, having owned both brands.",1464393600,,648,4.504273504273504

7398151,3,B014GQ8118,"Although the title states The Transporter is refueled, this latest installment in the series does not refuel much for such an iconic adrenaline-pumping atmosphere Transporter films are known for. That's not to say this film was a waste of time, if you are a fan of action flicks, or even a lover of the Transporter series, this film will fill some desires for fresh content, albeit not completely. To best break down a review of the film I will break it down into two groupings: The Let Downs and the Bright Spots.

The Let Downs:
-The biggest let down for me was the lack of development of our main character, the transporter himself. In the previous films we always saw some decent content surrounding Frank's background and or personal life whether they be through characters, plot line, or significant dialog. For me, this time around Frank was a pretty face who fought a lot and got the girl and that was the extent to his development. While his father is a key figure in the story, the film actually dives more into his past, his experiences, and his character than our protagonist. There were plugs to Frank's character, but nothing felt like it truly fit and rather was there to show some semblance of coherency.
-Along the lines of lack of character development came the haphazard story presented. Granted The Transporter is all about the car, the driver, and the job--this time around it felt like it was about the action and the Audi with the story being relegated to the trunk. I definitely believe things would have felt more coherent with more time spent developing the story and giving the audience something to cling onto.
-My final major gripe with the film had to do with the focus of the film itself. While I touched on it previously, the lack of developing a compelling tale hurt the film as a whole. I see 'Refueled' as a film trying to sucker punch you with action, speed, and lust rather than drawing you in and keeping you enthralled in a tale. This is definitely a personal let down more so than a technical flaw that could be argued, but I feel the overall vision of the film was off.

Bright Spots:
-The staple of 'The Transporter' is Frank's ability to drive, to work, and to fix any situation. 'Refueled' definitely gives us a Frank who does that exceptionally well. From the prospective of a character is a macho action film Frank excels in those categories performing extremely well in and out of the car. There is no doubting this is one of the most action-packed transporters to date.
-The choreographing of fight scenes felt fresh from the start. Any time the film ran off of its pulsing action scenes it did very well and showed once again why Transporter films need to remain in our film collections. Everything is bigger, badder, and more packed than before and in this sense Transporter felt refueled.
-Frank's father and his role in the film had to be my single favorite component. His character was mysterious and yet familiar while playing a pivotal role in all of the events that transpired throughout the film. While it pains me to say this, I felt like the top character award goes to Frank's father instead of the transporter himself.

Overall this is another solid addition to 'The Transporter' series. While I argue refueled is a stretch, this film does bring the transporter back to his role on the big screen and back to our homes. Don't pass this up, but understand it is an action flick and should not be held up for much else.

Ed Skrein is to Jason Statham what George Lazenby was to Sean Connery. I'm not sure if he was TRYING to sound like him or if they picked him because they thought he sounded like him, but that was distracting. He didn't seem as comfortable or as menacing in the fight scenes. The plot may not have been helped by Jason(but when has that ever mattered with Luc Besson).

The Transporter hit a rough spot after the conclusion of the third movie. The owners of the property decided to try a TV show.

This took place in broad daylight at the front of a building.  At least the Transporter switched license plates to hide his identity. Unfortunately, he did it after he had parked in the front of this building which I assume had at least a few cameras trained on it.  It got worse when the ""package"", actually 3 ""packages"" were identically attired and wigged bank robbers who had just performed a heist.  Shall I go on?

I did. For another few minutes, but my wife and I pretty much simultaneously said, ""This movie sucks!""

But, hey, it's viewable for no additional cost and it will only wast 30 minutes of your life, because you will not get through it.",1461456000,2,971,4.522988505747127

Lead actress wasn't much of an actress either. And kidnapping the dad twice? Silly. No real plot to get into - four prostitutes out for revenge.

Hell, i enjoyed it -almost as much as the first season ot the series. The original Frank was looking a bit long in tooth and even tired and bored by the last episode of Season Two. Time to ""reboot,"" indeed. I particularly enjoyed seeing the actor who played Frank's dad; he was the sidekick in the Rome series. The ""Junior"" references pronounced in a Sean Connery imitation of Indiana Jones' father by an actor who now really .resembles Sean Connery was a great piece of tongue-in-cheek. The twinkle in his eye  -skillfully captured by the cameraman- was fun for guys who enjoy action and light comedy blended well amid the typically beautiful Mediterranean with a plethora of long-legged ""007 women.""

8730712,5,B014GQ8118,"the shows starts with a bunch of ladies in the suv showing up a sex shop in  Catalina
come to find out, they are being sold into prostitution, then,  we go 15 years later,
whats going on and how are the ladies,  well, it seems  four of them have grown up and decided to get revenge on
the men that lied to them and sold them to begin with
the  fairy tail you have most likely read, ""THE LITTLE PIGS"" keep in mind as the show goes on
 this is later, so the guys are all doing different jobs now a days and the ladies need to find them,
they do, one by one and they get there bank codes to steal money from each of them
ana,(loan chabanol) the main girl  in the bunch sets up a elaborate plan to steal there money
as you see this, you would think a professional did all of this, but i was 4 ladies in all
there is lots of action and back stabbing and lots of lies to tell, sorry to say
some people were killed  in this  robbery, i would say, this is like fifty shades of grey without the sex
its all that entice and well thought out, oh, there is some great car driving with the car chase and
the good stunt driving by frank, (ed shrein)and franks dad (Ray STEVENSON) seems to always be in the wrong place at the right time to get kidnapped, this show will  make you happy  to see women kicking ass and taking names , but it will also pull at your heart strings to see what happens to the deal or no deal!! very well written and great acting by all involved!!",1535155200,,1457,3.972508591065292
