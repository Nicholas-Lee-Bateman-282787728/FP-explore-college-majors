4473286,5,B004UXVCQ4,"This is the best primer to prepare for this once in lifetime experience to view the August 2017 eclipse. It inspired me to already book flights so as not to miss it. Any travel, science loyalists, this is the definitively and expertly written book. It's an experience that's easy to read by the author who knows this subject better than anyone.

4473328,5,B004UXVCQ4,"I LOVED!!!! this documentary on such a legend as Mr. Jerry Weintraub. His life story as narrated by himself as well as those comments made by family members, friends, his wife and companion, among others, are fantastic. What a colorful and extraordinary character. I would have loved to meet such an interesting man which,by the way, reminds me of my father in many ways. God bless him!!!!",1390780800,,389,4.82089552238806

4473331,5,B004UXVCQ4,"Great doc on the life and work of Jerry Weintraub.  Audacious, Ambitious, Honest, Funny.  He has covered a lot a ground in one lifetime.",1357171200,,136,4.625
4473332,5,B004UXVCQ4,"""His Way"" is one of the most refreshing documentaries I've seen in a long time. You can't help but like Jerry and his wife, Jane, an incredible singer and smart woman. You can not tell me that the ""other woman"" in Jerry's life is not, at times, a thorn in Jane's side. But she hides it well (at least on camera) and comes across as truly a clever woman who will do what she has to do to keep her family and finances together despite the interference of the third wheel. Jerry's honesty and child-like love of life should be an example to everyone ""to do what you want to do without hurting anyone."" Live life with humor. So you take a risk and fail. Try again, make a funny story out of it and move on. Have fun and live life with emotional intelligence don't hang on to the past move forward. That really is the message of ""My Way."" Meanwhile, the comments from Jerry's friends were priceless and very funny. I especially like George Clooney's dry sense of humor and annoying pranks. I interviewed his Aunt Rosemary (well-known singer and actress) many years ago in Las Vegas and all she wanted to talk about was George and how famous he was going to be someday. He has a lot of loving people on his side and an insight into life and himself that makes everyone around him just a little bit better for knowing him. But if I had to pick one person who I admired the most it would have to be Jane. As a young woman I too traveled and lived in Europe off and on and I know exactly what Jane means when she says the Europeans are more sophisticated when it comes to relationships. They're much more realistic about ""love"" and less emotionally constipated. I wish Jane and Jerry nothing but the best for their family. I also enjoyed Matt Damon's story about not finishing Harvard and Jerry's offer to help get his diploma by stating ""there's always a guy."" I still have to laugh about that. As a news journalist for more than 30 plus years, he's right, there is always someone willing to do anything for money but in the end truth really does matter.",1346889600,,2046,4.344647519582246
4473333,5,B004UXVCQ4,"Exceptional life experiences. Entertaining, exciting and what a thinker on his feet.

Don't much care for his current life style.",1341964800,,129,5.45
4473334,3,B004UXVCQ4,"Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict -Initially, I feared His Way was going to be an incredibly tedious experience, as the first few minutes of the film are devoted to one celebrity after another fawning over the man: ""He's so amazing...he's like a father figure...he's a genius among geniuses...he's one of the greatest men I've ever known."" I'm paraphrasing, but that's the general idea. Thankfully, after the miscalculated introduction (it's unwise to start piling showers of praise on a guy before we've learned anything about what he's done to earn such praise) the film primarily focuses on Weintraub and allows him to do what he does best: capture our attention with his charmingly larger-than-life stories of behind-the-scenes adventures.

Though His Way is rarely as commanding or entertaining as the Robert Evans confessional The Kid Stays in the Picture, Weintraub's enthusiasm for the life he's lived is kind of infectious. When he recalls his initial encounters with Presley and Sinatra (two of the best stories this film has to offer), his eyes light up as if he's nothing more than a youthful fan recounting his brush with greatness. If Weintraub's accounts of events are to be believed, he stumbled into fame and fortune through a fortunate blend of cleverness, earnest naivete and luck. His swanky life wasn't handed down to him; his story is a heartening tale of pulling-oneself-up-by-the-bootstraps work ethic.

The film looks excellent on DVD, though there's not a whole lot to observe aside from some talking heads. The packaging heavily promotes the inclusion of clips of musical acts and films from Weintraub's career, but these are actually pretty minimal (as are other stills, bits of archival footage and so on). Audio is solid throughout, with a score by Rachel Portman (overqualified for this sort of thing, but a nice effort nonetheless) blending unobtrusively with the dialogue. The only supplement is some additional footage of Weintraub talking about his first job in the Air Force.

4473335,5,B004UXVCQ4,"Every since I saw the preview of this great HBO presentation...I was hooked. When I finally got to see it in its entirety...I was sold. I immediately went out and bought (2) hardcover books (one for me and one for my buddy). I wanted mine to be brand new becuase I simply wanted it all to myself (with no one else's fingerprints). The book is just as good as the documentary except that it has more stuff and more useful stories. I read it in just under two days and hate that I didn't save some for later-lol. I have the show locked-in on my DVR, but would really love to have a version on DVD. My poor buddy who does not have HBO, hasn't been able to see the documentary. Because of this, I would like to buy (2) copies (one for him and one for you know who-lol).

GREAT JOB, GREAT LIFE,...GREATEST INSPIRATION! Jerry Weintraub has allowed me to ""DREAM BIG"" again!

The movie is a great intro to his story, but I recommend reading or listening to his Audible book ""When I Stop Talking, You'll Know I'm Dead: Useful Stories from a Persuasive Man""",1493337600,,325,4.241935483870968
8442465,5,B004UXVCQ4,"I've watched this three times so far and liked it so much I even paid for it this last time.

Jerry Weintraub was the ultimate American self made success story, triumphing through his confidence, ability to bluff and persist, a salesman extraordinaire. He was obviously born with a blessed nature, in his ability to bounce back, to not take rejection to heart, and to survive and thrive and reinvent himself in the shark infested Hollywood waters.

It's his sunny resilient nature that fascinates and inspires me. Also how he managed to keep his wife as a friend while having a long time mistress. It's not something most would approve of but I found it very civilized and if only other people could do this , versus blowing up the institution and security that families can become. The difference between detente and diplomatic relations vs cold or hot war between two countries.

What a life! He was the Forrest Gump of the entertainment business in mid century America, up through to a few years ago.",1476230400,2,1003,4.752873563218391

I loved the stories about working with Sinatra, Elvis, and COL Parker.  I would have liked to have met Mr. Weintraub for even a few minutes.  His enthusiasm for life is something we all can use.",1449014400,,337,4.0606060606060606
