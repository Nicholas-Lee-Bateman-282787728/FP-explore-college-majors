1339157,3,B00004CIWC,"This is a really good movie with credible acting and drama.  Always was.  Hard to believe the writer eventually went on to write SHOWGIRLS!

One correction: To ""rjclaster"", Stallones's character name is JOHNNY Kovak, not Frank.

One question: To ""cjs1989"", are you seriously telling us that you're the son of director Norman Jewison?  If you're for real, I'm sorry, but F.I.S.T. was not his best film.  For my money, it will always be AND JUSTICE FOR ALL!",1136505600,,455,4.8441558441558445
1339158,3,B00004CIWC,"F.I.S.T. scriptwriter Joe Ezsterhas recalled the explosive collaboration with his ""co-writer"" Sylvester Stallone in his autobiography published last year.  Robert De Niro, still considered to be the best actor of his generation and at the top of his creative peak shortly after his Oscar-nominated performance in Taxi Driver (1976), was originally asked by director Norman Jewison to take on the blue-collar anti-hero.  But De Niro could not make up his mind and by the time he finally agreed, it was too late - another Italian-American upcoming star already agreed to make Johnny Kovac his first project after the roaring Oscar success of Rocky (1976).

Jewison happily agreed to Stallone's request at rewriting Ezsterhas's script - after all, Stallone just received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for Rocky (as well as a Best Actor nomination, competing with the likes of De Niro).  But Ezsterhas, who spent several years researching for his account of the tragedy of the union movement, was less happy that Stallone would also receive a writing credit - the only thing that Stallone did was to shorten Ezsterhas' uneconomically (from a Hollywood feature perspective) long script.

The production of F.I.S.T. (1978) was characterized by a growing confrontation between Stallone and both the director and (""real"") writer of the film.  Jewison bought Ezsterhas's view of Johnny Kovac (loosely modeled on Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa) as a corrupted leader destroyed by his dealings with the mafia.  Stallone, however, preferred a more Rocky-esque view of Kovac, more along the lines of trade union icon Walter Reuther than the thuggish Hoffa.

Stallone was very unhappy with the end result and refused to do any promotional work for F.I.S.T.  Jewison filmed a number of alternative endings and, after audiences at a pre-screening session reacted indifferently to the various endings, Jewison decided to end the movie as he originally planned (before Stallone's botched attempt to interfere with Jewison's plans).  Let us not spoil the movie except to say that this was a very un-Stallone-ish ending.  Compare this ending to the original ending of First Blood (1982), now available for the first time on the Ultimate Edition DVD released last year. If we compare the ending of the original Get Carter (1971) and the Stallone version released in 2000, we see that, as in the case of First Blood (based on David Morrell's 1972 novel) Stallone's heroic conception of what is essentially a 1970s anti-hero won the day.

Despite the negative critical reception at the time of F.I.S.T.'s release, critics today will agree that this was one of Stallone's best performances in which he (despite the Rambo-esque aggressiveness) actually gave a fairly credible dramatic performance of blue-collar vulnerability along the lines of Rocky and Copland (1997).  At the time of Rocky, Stallone was compared with the likes of De Niro and in Copland Stallone actually plays alongside De Niro - but their portrayal of anti-heroes were polar opposites.  Notice the difference between boxing champions Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta of Raging Bull (1980), between disturbed, vengeful Vietnam vets John Rambo (as portrayed in the sequels) and Travis Bickle of Taxi Driver - and between Johnny Kovac and Noodles (gangster involved in trade union corruption) of Once Upon A Time in the West (1984).",1129507200,6,3391,5.2439926062846585
1339179,4,B00004CIWC,"The rise and fall of a Jimmy Hoffa-like labor organizer, F.I.S.T. benefits from a strong supporting cast,a knowing script and a good sense of place. Those tired of the archetypal Stallone underdog may find interest in his morally challenged Johnny Kovak character. Norman Jewison directs Stallone into some dark, unlikable territory here. He does an admirable job, though the aging Kovak with crude graying temples in the 3rd act doesn't work well. Still, this is very engaging drama, sober and cynical. It's much better than Hoffa or the equally clownish All the King's Men remake. F.I.S.T. is rooted firmly in 70's disillusionment cinema and worth a look.",1463097600,,657,5.149532710280374

Sylvester Stallone said shortly after that he was extremely displeased with the editing and with Norman Jewison. Stallone said that up to three takes were filmed of each important scene and that in each instance, Jewison selected the most tame of the three for production. So this movie could have been a lot more exciting and dramatic.

1339217,5,B00004CIWC,"F.I.S.T., 1978 film

Men are loading crates on a truck. They dislike their working conditions. A wildcat strike leads to a promise of better conditions. [Campaign promises?] The next day there is a lockout of the workers who asked for better working conditions. The head of the local union asks Johnny to work as an organizer to sign up workers for the trucking union. It's not easy. An overworked driver can have an accident and become unable to work. A lawyer offers him money to work for the corporation; it is rejected. [Kovak was fooled once.] Anna tells Johnny about two girls who were fired and blacklisted. A gang of men attacks him for his union work. The head of the union warns against agitators. Johnny's friend is also beaten as a warning. The union wants medical insurance and paid overtime. The corporation offers nothing. There is a strike.

A gang attacks the striking workers with baseball bats. One man shoots Monahan, the local president. Johnny leads the men now. John L. Lewis supports them. The union will strike back. ""Its time."" [They don't tell who are the opponents of the union.] Its like urban warfare. The company settles with the union. Johnny travels to other cities to organize truckers. Then he makes a deal with a jukebox distributor. Is he on the take? Johnny goes to Washington and answers questions. Who owns the company that makes those toy trucks? This and other information is used to get the union president's resignation, and his replacement by Johnny Kovak. Kovak is a hard bargainer; he gets an 8% increase. But the corporations strike back with a Senate investigation. [Who owns the Washington Senators?] Does power corrupt? Were there ties to organized crime?

Mr. Milano is questioned by Senator Graham about his loans from the Trucking Pension Fund. Vinnie Doyle takes the Fifth Amendment when asked his name. [For legal reasons.] A convoy of trucks blocks the streets of Washington. Abe Belkin is called by Senator Graham; will he talk? He had to make deals. There is a hold-up at a grocery store, the robber shoots Abe Belkin and his guard. Kovak represents the 3 million members of his union. Kovak says he never took nothing. He once killed in self-defense in 1938. Senator Graham provokes him into leaving the hearing. [Background investigation?] One night Johnny comes home late. Two men greet him with a shotgun. [This is a fictionalized version based on actual history.]

The trucker's union started in the Mid-West and spread to other states with the same conditions. Around 1940 a new law was passed to eliminate the radical leaders. They were replaced by men who cooperated with organized crime. Corporations had long used gun men and organized crime to oppress workers since the 1870s until workers were unionized in the 1930s. The Establishment prefers corrupt union leaders who will make sweetheart deals with corporations. The Eastern Conference of truckers was forced to turn over their pension fund to Wall Street; they earned about 1% to 2%. The Western Conference of truckers kept control of their pension fund and earned about 3% to 4%. [These figures are not recent.] The Senate Investigations were a way to attack unions and allow Wall Street to get control of their pension funds. Does Wall Street control your pension funds? Would you want them to put your money into synthetic CDOs?",1428969600,,3356,4.903169014084507

1339237,5,B00004CIWC,"F.I.S.T. is Sylvester Stallone's first film after gaining success and stardom in Rocky. In it,he plays Johnny Kovak, a Cleveland warehouse worker who becomes involved in the labor union leadership of the fictional ""Federation of Inter-State Truckers"" or F.I.S.T. He finds that he must sacrifice his principles as he moves up through the union and attempts to expand its influence. Among them is getting involved with the mob. It was loosely based on the Teamsters union and their former union president,Jimmy Hoffa.

It was definitely an enjoyable and entertaining film as the viewer get to see Stallone play a different role that relies on his capability as an actor rather than an action star. He did well as a Kovak. Also,the film provides great insight on unions and how the mob gets involved with it through its detriment. This also is a signature films for unions and union members.

1339260,5,B00004CIWC,"This is truly a great movie adaption of the Hoffa era. Not to repeat others positive reviews as I agree with each one, there is something I must point out. This is NOT the complete movie being offered.

I recall watching this movie in the 80s. At that time, the movie contained footage prior to the main opening which included the death of Johnny Kovack's father and the employer's lack of benefits as the result of his death. This scene is missing.

Another missing scene is Johnny Kovack meeting his board members, specifically telling them to stop spending money "" no more bahamas in Winter!"".

I don't know if anyone else knows what I mean by these two scenes, but knowing that they existed makes me disappointed that with each release (VHS, DVD, Bluray), this movie is STILL NOT COMPLETE.

Despite the missing scenes, this is still a great movie and definitely not one to be missed, particularly if you are a Sylvester Stallone fan. Other movies around this time that were great he was in were The Lords of Flatbush and Capone. Don't miss these movies either.",1384041600,7,1064,4.6436170212765955

1339277,4,B00004CIWC,"When FIST came out in 1978, I had the opportunity to see it in the theaters. It was just two years after ROCKY and everyone knew the name Sylvester Stallone. The film is fictional but loosely based on the life of Jimmy Hoffa, the union leader whose relationship with powerful underworld figures ultimately led to his downfall and eventual murder in 1975.

The film is powerfully acted by Stallone, as the fictional union leader Johnny Kovak. Stallone gives perhaps his best performance after Rocky. The supporting players include Rod Steiger, as Senator Madison, who investigates possible mafia ties between Kovak and Babe Milano, played by Tony LoBianco.  This is based on the Hoffa Kennedy fued in the late fifties that lasted well into the Kennedy presidency where Senator Bobby Kennedy soon to become Attorney General never let up on his efforts to get Hoffa at whatever cost.

FIST begins in 1937 where Johnny Kovak working in a warehouse begins to witness the abuse by the bosses against the workers, including working longer hours, docking pay and no compensation.  This leads to Kovak and his friend Abe Belkin, played with compassion and courage by David Huffman, one of our most underrated actors, to join the Federation of Interstate Truckers (F.I.S.T.). The next 20 years in the film follows Johnny's rise to the presidency of the union and his relationship with mafia boss Anthony ""Babe"" Milano.  Melinda Dillon plays Anna, Johnny's love interest throughout the film.

The opening credits are the largest I have ever seen in a film. They fill the screen obliterating most of the background behind them. Bill Conti's music evokes the grandeur and tragedy of power in robust swelling fashion.

Highly recommended!!

1339278,5,B00004CIWC,This movie was recommended to me for some research I'm doing on the Teamsters Union and it was excellent. Somehow I don't think it was a big production in the 80s and/or I just wasn't aware of it at the time. But it's worth viewing to see how the Teamsters (thought this is a very loose translation of what really happened so they are called FIST Union) helped shape the benefits of U.S. workers today in a positive way. S. Stallone plays a version of Jimmy Hoffa getting involved with the mob and his demise.,1302220800,2,509,4.368421052631579

1339280,3,B00004CIWC,"What is it about some directors and stars that make them follow up their biggest hits with misleadingly titled movies that just set them up for audience disappointment? Audiences seeing a film called Sorcerer from the director of The Exorcist advertised with a grimacing statue probably weren't too thrilled to find a thriller about truck drivers in South America and an audience lured into a film called F.I.S.T. by posters of Sly Stallone, fresh from Rocky, wielding an axe handle at the head of a mob probably weren't best pleased to find they'd bought a ticket to a drama about the growth and corruption of the American union movement. F.I.S.T. in this case stands for Federal Inter-State truckers - not, absolutely not, the Teamsters - and Stallone plays the union organiser who brings the mob in to win a strike only to find he can't get them out who absolutely isn't Jimmy Hoffa even if he does end up as a question mark on a bumper sticker.

Directed by Norman Jewison from a Joe Esterhas script with cinematography by Lazlo Kovacs, it's an admirably ambitious film. Charting the union from its days as hungry men with no rights to fat men by the pool with young girls who aren't their wives as the small group of bullied workers in the 30s grows into the biggest bully on the block by the 60s when Stallone comes up against Rod Steiger's racket busting senator, it's strangely lacking in punch or impact. There are good scenes and some inspired casting - not least Kevin Conway in the kind of role Brian Donlevy would have played in the 30s and 40s - but it often feels flat and underdeveloped. Jewison manages to keep Steiger and Peter Boyle's performances in check, but he's less successful with Stallone. Still in the period when he wanted to be the next Brando rather than the first Arnie, the star does some good work but loses some of his potentially best moments by incoherent mumbling or inaudible whispering under his breath that makes stretches of dialogue incomprehensible without subtitles. Still, it's nice to see De Mille regular Henry Wilcoxen as a blithely patronisingly patrician boss and Bill Conti's sweepingly epic score is impressive even if some of the music editing does it no favors.

For the most part the story itself is compelling enough but, the characters seem one dimensional and after a good first half the characters, not the story make the film drag. It's a shame because the film's not bad but, it's pretty forgettable. Like the movie 'Hoffa' which this film is obviously emulating it has an unsatisfying ending, this one being way too abrupt! I had invested 2 1/2 hours in this mediocre film and it just ended badly! It's OK as I did enjoy the film but, I doubt I will ever watch it again.",1203206400,9,690,4.315384615384615
1339328,5,B00004CIWC,"The storyline is somewhat predictable, but Stallone's performance...was not. [Correct me if I'm wrong], but if this movie followed ""Paradise Alley"", and you sat slack-jawed in that popcorn palace somewhere in Bergen County, N.J., witnessing a cultural event not exactly designed to inspire, his acting will floor you sooner than a Rocky upper-cut. He seems to have aged ten years (in movie years) and stays in character, in a non-*character* role!
In only one scene do we see encounter any off-beat Balboa-isms, the scene in which he exchanges romantic glances with Melinda Dillon. Perhaps his most powerful scene occurs in Washington, DC, as he refuses to back-down in a National contract conference. This time, the guy-from-the-streets-turned-Union Leader, overplays his hand, and the whole game begins to break down.
It all comes apart with a shattering thud: his terrible judgement in believing in bad people, believing that some illegality was acceptable if it meant supporting his Union - just an uncomfortable sacrifice on his part; in ways revealing (to the viewer, not the character) his own flaw as an individual capable of violence.
Tony Lo Bianco gives an amazing career performance, as his ""outside help"", who becomes a bottomless pit of helping himself to the fruits of the labor of many blue-collar workers.
Rod Steiger and Peter Boyle, like Sly and Tony, also deliver performances one might describe as drammatically over-the-top.
Good attention period detail.",1181001600,5,1476,5.311965811965812
1339329,5,B00004CIWC,"I purchased this movie because parts of this were produced in the city of Dubuque,Iowa some 30 years ago. The movie was released after the first Rocky movie came out. Critics were lukewarm to this movie but I thought Sly Stallone gave an okay performance as Johnny Kovac, a man instrumental with the Federation of Inter State Truckers, sort of like the Teamsters. The movie follows Kovac in his years working in a loading dock,followed by a strike and the eventual leadership of his union into the 1950's to his death. Good acting but too bad the movie didn't get the recognition it deserved.",1178409600,2,592,4.701923076923077
1339330,4,B00004CIWC,"Let me say that I've always been a Stallone fan.  I've always liked such films as Rocky I & II, Copland, the original First Blood, Lock Up, and Cliffhanger.  If those are your favorites as well, then I think you'll like F.I.S.T.

I won't rehash the plot here, you can read about that in Amazon's description.  What I will say is that if Sly had continued in the direction of films like this, I think he'd be perceived today as being a much better actor.  When he opens his heart to a role, and truly gives of himself to a character, he is capable of great things.  ""Rocky"" and ""Copland"" are great examples of this.  ""F.I.S.T."" isn't quite on a par with ""Copland"", and it doesn't pack the emotional weight of ""Rocky"", but it still deserves to be listed amoungst those films as examples of what Sly can do when he lets his guard down.

If, on the other hand, you want to see Sly's work when his guard is up and he's totally closed his inner self off to a role, go watch ""Cobra"" or ""Rambo III"".  Yes, ""Rambo III"" has its merits, but Sly so often hid his inner gifts from the camera's eye, and that's just not what acting's about.

This is a film in which Sly truly invested himself.  His performance is strong, and I hope that Hollywood gives him a chance to flex his acting muscles again sometime soon.  ""Rocky Balboa"" is soon to be released, directed and written by Stallone.  Hopefully it will remind the movie moguls that this man is has his gifts.  If you'd like to see Stallone showing some of his dramatic talents, watch this film.

And Mr. Stallone, if you are reading this, please consider a film version of ""Death of a Salesman"".  You'd be perfect for it, and you already got a standing ovation for it when you were still a young man and contemplating being an actor.  A film version, directed by you, would be great.

Also, how about a film about Bernard Kerik?  A few years ago I read a story about how both you and Mel Gibson were competing for this role.  The solution?  You star and co-write the screenplay with Mr. Kerik, whilst Mr. Gibson directs and produces.  It's a winning combination.  Mr. Stallone, you're all about New York and Mel isn't, but Mel's experience with acting in and directing great character-driven action roles would make him the perfect director for you in such an outing.",1158278400,4,2308,4.4299287410926365
1339331,3,B00004CIWC,The first and principal aspect to remark is that we are on front of the most distinguished performance  ever made in previous or late entries of  Sylvester Stallone. But the script (despite the magisterial direction of Norman Jewison) unexplainably lacked of punch and expressive forcer. The resemblances with On the waterfront are too many. And that was pitifully its own perdition.,1149292800,2,383,5.262295081967213
1339332,4,B00004CIWC,"Stallone is and has always been a fine actor. I agree when some say he strayed away from it over the years,but to say he is bad and be surprised that he can do good work is an insult. His performance in this very entertaining and epic drama is perfect example(while films like Tango & Cash are examples of ""just pay me""Stallone).I'm never surprised when he is great in a film,I'm more surprised when he coasts through. Check this film out if you want to be entertained,and watch an underated thespian at his best.",1137369600,4,513,4.468085106382978
1339333,4,B00004CIWC,"This fictionalized account of Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters Union is riveting for more than half the film but looses steam as it reaches it's conclusion.  It's not that the latter part of the story doesn't have inherent interest rather director Norman Jewison directs this portion rather ploddingly and less assured than the film's earlier moments.  What is refreshing is that this is probably the best work that Sylvester Stallone has ever done in a film.  Stallone is required to age 20 years or so in the film and he is more than up to the demands of playing Johnny Kovak, a union leader forced to make unconscionable compromises in order to strengthen his union.  It's unfortunate that Stallone didn't gravitate more towards these type of projects during the course of his career.  Film does contain a strong supporting cast in David Huffman, Kevin Conway, Peter Boyle, Tony LoBianco, and Melinda Dillon.  I did find a little overbearing Rod Steiger as a headline grabbing Senator.",1136678400,3,985,4.9393939393939394
