1231132,5,B00000IXOR,"I just watched the whole collection, and it was simply breathtaking.  The first DVD, Just Judy, has many Garland solo performances from different shows.
Just by listening to Judy sing live ""Last Night When We Were  Young"" I got my money's worth.  If you can sit through that song  without being overcome by emotion, then you are made of steel.",941846400,,343,4.666666666666667
1231133,5,B00000IXOR,"This has to be the FINEST example of Judy's work that has ever been released by a major company. What a joy!  Other reviewers have posted many similiar thoughts I have about this.
This is definately something for  everyone's library....when discussing Artists..regarless of one's  preference in music genres.....Judy is the Standard Bearer....and she did  it LIVE....with no...trickery....Madonna, Bette, Celine, Whitney, Babs and  others.....should fall at the feet of this wonderful and great artist....",936057600,,505,5.863013698630137

1231135,5,B00000IXOR,"The art of performing a song seems lost on so many of today's popular singers.  Emphasis has shifted from the lyrics and phrasing to the number of ""vocal licks"" one can muster per syllable.  To see the  all-too-real emotional journey Garland crosses during ""Old Man  River"" was worth the cost of the DVD.  Micky rooney seems a little  rusty and Van Dyke is a tad hokey.  However, it's nice to see Liza take her  baby steps at Judy's side.",930096000,,438,4.455696202531645
1231136,5,B00000IXOR,"For any Garland fan or newcomer, these television shows are the very best way to see Judy at her finest in live performance.  While the shows themselves may seem trite at times, the nostalga (advertisers, mid-show  bumpers and TV ads for upcoming Judy show guests) and star factors alone  are worth the viewing time.  Not to mention it's JUDY!!  Mickey Rooney and  Judy are great in Show #1 especially in the outtake footage at the end.  Liza's show, Show #3 is just not to be missed.  The clarity and sound are  impecable and with this DVD you will be entertained for the entire 2 hours  plus.  Judy demonstrates nothing less than talent at its purest form.  She  needs do nothing but stand there and sing!  Solo highlights from these two  shows include ""When the Sun Comes Out"",""Ole Man River"",  ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" and ""As Long As He Needs Me.""

1231150,3,B00000IXOR,The Jerry Van Dyke skit where he performs to the sound track of the first Lone Ranger radio show.  Who else would have thought of this.  Comic genius in my opinion.,1376179200,,164,4.258064516129032
1231151,3,B00000IXOR,"Although Judy Garland is one of my favorite performers, I found ""The Judy Garland Show"" to be lacking.  Not enough Judy. And when Judy was on, she seemed off and awkward.  Part of this I know had to do with her insecurities, but it's so much more evident in this show than in movie roles or even concert footage.  I know the rest of the season is available, but I won't be buying them.  In fact, I'll be reselling this one.",1373328000,2,423,4.185185185185185
1231152,4,B00000IXOR,"I agree totally with the other reviewers that it was a huge waste of airtime to have Jerry van Dyke on the show, and unfortunately as a regular! Anytime he came on I fast-forwarded through his annoying skits. I am even more annoyed because I bought several of these Volumes and now I will have to FF through him repeatedly.

Seeing young, fit Torme was a treat as I had seen him at Michael's Pub late in life. Also the genuine affection and affinity Liza and Judy shared moved me to tears. Seeing them together made up a little for my disappointment, I can't believe an astute producer such as young George Schlatter opted to have van Dyke as a regular (ugh). I worked with Schlatter in the 1980's and I am stunned at his choice. Also Count Basie was under-utlized. If you can tolerate the annoying van Dyke ""pop-ups,"" then it's worth seeing. If I had the equipment, I would edit him out of all the episodes. In the meantime, thanks God for the FF key on my dvd player! For those who can't get enough of Judy like myself, get one volume and then decide if you want more.",1368921600,,1070,4.323383084577115

1231156,4,B00000IXOR,"Volume 12 of ""The Judy Garland Show""  (CBS, 1963-1964)  features two episodes that range from gloriously sublime to occasionally awkward:
  SHOW 10: This episode was originally taped October 11, 1963 but, curiously, not aired  until March 1, 1964. Also, Judy's glorious performances of ""Hello, Bluebird"", ""If Love Were All"" and ""Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart"" are actually inserted here from the episode taped December 19, 1963. (That great episode paired Judy with Bobby Darin. What is going on CBS?). In any event, Show 10 is a wonderful hour featuring Judy with Jane Powell and Ray Bolger. Show 10 was also, mercifully, Jerry Van Dyke's final appearance as a series regular on ""The Judy Garland Show.""
  Jane Powell sings a beautiful rendition of ""Dear Friend"" from the Broadway musical ""She Loves Me."" Ray Bolger does a solo dance routine and is later joined by Judy for ""On The Sunny Side Of The Street."" Judy and Ray Bolger share a warm, sentimental chat about the making of ""The Wizard Of Oz"", singing ""If I Only Had A Brain"" and ""We're Off To See The Wizard"". Judy sang ""Over The Rainbow"" to her children Lorna and Joe Luft on the classic Christmas episode (taped December 6, 1963). I wish ""Over The Rainbow"" had been saved for this episode. It would have been more emotional and moving if Judy had sang it, just once,  with Ray Bolger  beside her. Nevertheless,  Judy, Ray, Jane Powell and dancers do join together for an effectively staged version of ""The Jitterbug,"" which was famously cut from ""The Wizard Of Oz."" ""The Jitterbug"" is entertaining on its own, but, coming just prior to the attack of the flying monkeys, it would have ruined the dramatic flow of ""Oz."" Thank goodness it was wisely cut from the film.
  SHOW 12: Judy is paired with Vic Damone (quite successfully) and Zina Bethune ( quite awkwardly). But the fact that Bethune was tragically killed in 2012 makes this episode sadly poignant now. In 1963, Bethune was starring in the CBS drama ""The Nurses."" (Does anybody remember ""The Nurses?""). Here, Bethune dances a well-received routine to ""Crazy Rhythm."" Her  obviously scripted chat with Judy is downright weird. Judy mentions that she hates hot milk, but she'll have it ""with a shot of... chocolate in it."" (Ha! Ha! What? Judy definitely did not mean chocolate).  Judy and Vic Damone duet on a memorable medley from ""Porgy And Bess"", but the ""All-Purpose Holiday Medley"" for Judy, Vic, Zina, and dancers is ill-conceived. Fortunately, Judy's solos of ""From This Moment On"" and ""Moon River"" are sure-fire and solid. And Judy's definitive versions of ""Smile"" and ""Rockabye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody"" bring this episode to an inspiring finale. Damn, Judy certainly knows how to entertain and inspire, better than anybody else in show-business, ever.",1340496000,2,2787,4.889596602972399
1231157,5,B00000IXOR,"A new 8 disc set is about to be released. It includes ALL of the TV shows plus out-takes, rare footage and more!
I can hardly wait.",1316390400,,131,3.888888888888889
1231168,5,B00000IXOR,"I remember seeing this show on PBS years ago. Judy is at her best. Her performances of ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" and ""As Long as He Needs Me"" are among her best. The quality is excellent but I must say I am VERY disappointed. The liner notes state that Liza sings ""You Are For Loving"" from her off B'way show ""Best Foot Forward"". This has been cut and in it's place is an inept 'Lone Ranger' skit with the very untalented Jerry Van Dyke. The liner notes also state that there are outtakes, which is also not true. The Editorial Review on the  Amazon product page states that the first episode on this disc is the show with Mickey Rooney. It is NOT. I have to wonder if the person who wrote the liner notes and the person who wrote the Editorial Review even knew what was on the disc.",1295481600,14,783,4.185430463576159
1231169,2,B00000IXOR,"This series of DVDs seemed to have great promise when announced ... a re-release of out-of-print material previously released by Pioneer and Geneon, with the mention of improved sound quality. This series may have slightly better sound but is painfully lacking due to having been ruthlessly edited. Why they would do this seems incredible ... whole chunks of the shows are missing and the promised extra material is minimal. Searching out used copies of the previous releases would be much more satisfying, if you want my advice. I bought Volume 1 but was unhappy with it. Volume 2 just arrived today and is equally poorly done. I am returning it for refund. Such a huge disappointment.",1254355200,32,686,4.922413793103448
1231170,5,B00000IXOR,"Judy passed away 40 years ago, but the packaged, select dvd episodes from her iconic series, ""The Judy Garland Show,"" is available for fans, admirers, students, archivists and aspiring performers to see Judy at her live-performing best. It is not about an actress playing a part...it is Judy playing Judy. I'm not knocking her many motion picture performances...many became classics, but watching Judy on her series represented a more personal, heartfelt and genuine performances from a musical legend. There were 26 one hour episodes video taped beginning on June 24, 1963 and ending on March 13, 1964 at CBS Television City. Combine these performances with her motion pictures and they constitute the largest tribute collection available for a musical legend available. This dvd collection makes it possible for younger audiences to see and hear what Judy Garland was all about. Hopefully, they will become fans and will continue the legend of Judy's popularity.
Some of the musical guests on this collection are Count Basie, Tony Bennett, Vic Damone, Lena Horn, Steve Lawrence, Mickey Rooney and a genuine highlight, her daughter Liza. Liza appeared on show #3 and at age 17, it was so apparent that Liza inherited the talent genes from her Mom. Shockingly great performances throughout the episode from Liza and Judy. This collection is a wonderful starter kit. If you shop around, you will find other episodes available to buy. I know I will be looking to add to this collection, and I was the CBS Production Supervisor for Judy's series...and I know first hand that the ""The Judy Garland Show"" was very special.",1251590400,7,1617,5.082706766917293
1231171,4,B00000IXOR,"You can read the details of the musical numbers in the two shows presented in this volume - the first of 13 to come from Infinity - so I won't rehash that information here.  I will say that the print is GORGEOUS black and white and the sound wonderful. The discs come from the first generation video tapes that were made of the shows in 1968. (These are not kinescopes.) In fact both episodes include the full end title music and the first episode continues through Garland's taking an extra bow to the live audience.

The first of the two shows here features Count Basie and the opening number has Basie accompanying Garland on a Hammond organ (!) for Eubie Blake's classic ""Memories of You"". We also get a rare chance to see the exceedingly tall folk singer Judy Henske.

The second show is best known as the ""Liza Show"" because then-seventeen year old Liza Minnelli partners with her mom for most of the musical numbers - though each gets a solo turn. They not only sing - but dance! Soupy Sales is here too and actually does a good job singing ""I'm Calm"".

All the above wonderful material is, however, spoiled by the many appearances of Jerry Van Dyke - the annoying and extremely unfunny brother of the talented Dick Van Dyke. (Wasn't Jerry's big career move starring in ""My Mother The Car"" on TV""). You cringe every time he appears. He wastes a FULL nine minutes on the ""Liza"" show with a pantomime of the first episode of the show The Lone Ranger!

Its surprising that the producers of this DVD went to the effort of creating ""chapter stops"" but didn't place them at the beginning of songs or comedy bits so you could reply the highlights. Instead each show has only 6 chapters. So you can't just jump to the great moments. Hopefully they will fix this on future volumes.

I would have given this volume SIX stars - its THAT good when Judy and Liza & Basie are on - but Jerry Van Dyke is so awful that I he gets a MINUS 2, resulting in my four star review.

I'm looking forward to future volumes to see what incredible guest stars Judy teams with.

1231172,4,B00000IXOR,"Infinity Entertainment is re-releasing ""The Judy Garland Show"" (1963-1964) on DVD. The series was previously available on Pioneer, but those editions have since gone out of print. Infinity promises to release all 26 episodes in a 12 Volume Set-- 2 episodes on each DVD.
  The first episode of Volume One illustrates what was wrong with the show. All three major TV networks at the time (CBS, NBC, and ABC) had a bidding war to sign the amazing and incomparable Judy Garland to a weekly TV series. CBS, having won, couldn't decide which ""format"" to put Judy in (note: nobody ""formats""  Judy Garland!) and seemed determined to change her from a dynamic diva into an average TV personality. Whatever changes CBS threw at her (and their were innumerable changes throughout the 26 episodes), Judy gamely rolled with the punches and gave her very best.
  The first episode starts promisingly; with Judy singing ""The Sweetest Sounds"" with Count Basie and his orchestra. Later, she also sings ""Memories Of You."" There should have been more musical magic with Judy and Count Basie. Instead, too much time is wasted on asinine ""comedy routines"" with series regular Jerry Van Dyke. Please, Jerry Van Dyke never belonged on the same stage as Judy Garland! Mel Torme sings a manic version of ""Fascinating Rhythm"" while simultaneously playing drums. Obscure folk singer Judy Henske (who?) delivers a strong rendition of Billie Holiday's classic ""God Bless The Child,"" and then joins Jerry and Mel for a pointless parody of Peter, Paul, and Mary called ""Peter, Paul, And Irving."" Judy Garland, finally and at last, returns to close the episode with the heartbreakingly sad ""A Cottage For Sale"" and the rousing ""Hey, Look Me Over"" from the forgotten Lucille Ball musical ""Wildcat."" Distressingly, the viewer will notice there is not enough of Judy Garland on this episode of ""The Judy Garland Show.""
  The second episode, though featuring more pointless ""comedy routines"" from Jerry Van Dyke and Soupy Sales, is of far better quality and much more entertaining. This is because Judy's special guest is her own daughter Liza Minnelli.  It is a treat to see young Liza at 17, nearly a decade away from her own career breakthrough in the film version of ""Cabaret"" and her TV concert ""Liza With A Z."" The strong mother-daughter bond is evident everywhere here. The affection between Judy and Liza is genuine and affecting. The Judy/Liza duets here are magical. Liza also does her own solo song and dance routine, and The Brothers Castro from Mexico offer a sexy, Latin twist on ""You Make Me Feel So Young."" Most importantly, Judy Garland: The Dynamic Diva is seen full force here as she delivers explosive performances of ""Come Rain Or Come Shine"" and ""As Long As He Needs Me.""
  I'm removing one star from my review because I find Jerry Van Dyke so annoying and unnecessary. Judy Garland, the greatest entertainer of the 20th  Century, definitely deserves five stars! These episodes were both taped in July of 1963, when Judy was age 41. She would leave us much too soon; just six years later at age 47. But Judy looks fabulous here and is in excellent voice. Judy's timeless talent will live forever!",1249862400,10,3182,4.895910780669145
1231173,5,B00000IXOR,"Anyone wanting to see the best work Judy Garland ever did, viewing the old ""Judy Garland Show"" episodes is an ideal place to start. Premiering in the fall of 1963 ""The Judy Garland Show"" was CBS' answer in their fight againt the number rated show on television at that time, NBC's ""Bonanza"".  However, that timeslot proved to be disastrous for Judy's show and to herself as ""Bonanaza"" would continue to dominate the Nielsen ratings. What followed during Judy's one season on network TV was constant changes in writers, producers, and formats, but Judy, being the pro she was, proved to the world that she was a trooper, and she showcased her finest performances with her amazing and original vocal talent.
 ""The Judy Garland Show"" has been released on DVD in various forms over the years, and those DVD's are long out-of-print. Now comes these amazing volumes released by Infinity Entertainment. This first volume features 2 episodes in glorious black and white, cleaned from the studio's master tapes. The episodes in this package are episodes #2, taped on July 7th, 1963 (aired on November 10th, 1963) featuring Count Basie and Judy Henske as guests. The second episode is #3 taped on July 16th, 1963 (aired on November 17th, 1963) and features Judy's daughter Liza Minnelli as the guest star. Soupy Sales also makes an appearance.
 Infinity Entertainment has stated they will be releasing 13 volumes of ""The Judy Garland Show"" over time, with two shows in each disc. ""The Judy Garland Show-Volume 2"" is going to be released on September 22nd, 2009, so look for that!
 I also have to recommend that another great DVD showcasing Judy is her performance that she did in London in 1964 with Liza called ""Judy and Liza At The Palladium"".",1248912000,,1735,4.871186440677966

It also was the first time I'd seen Judy Garland's 1963-64 TV series, and the first (of now many times) that I have read and referred to the really excellent and informative  paperback book 'Rainbows End' written by Coyne Sanders which comes in this awesome DVD package.

Some 200 DVDs later in my collection, I'm happy that this is the one that got me started with collecting DVDs in the first place.  I wish more box sets would include books and supplemental material so richly provided with this box set. It belongs in the home of every fan of Judy Garland and the guest performances are to behold- because of this show, I was introduced to Peggy Lee, Martha Raye, Vic Damone and other excellent musical talents I'd  heard of, but basically had never seen perform.

1231177,5,B00000IXOR,"These two early episodes of Judy Garland's weekly T.V. series show her at her absolute zenith....looking slim, glamorous, and gorgeous, and singing like no one else could ever come close to! Her versions of Old Man River, As Long As He Needs Me, Come Rain or Come Shine, and When The Sun Comes Out are so emotionally charged and soulful and show her unmatched ability to rip her heart out for her audiences. Mickey Rooney is also very enjoyable, and very affectionate with his old MGM pal. Hearing them ad-lib to old photographs of themselves when they were teenagers is simply charming and full of wit. Liza is also fun to watch in this very early stage of her career, as she is so energetic and full of spunk! These television shows are simply classic, and if some of the intervening segments lag (like the scenes with Jerry Van Dyke), they don't override the greatness and brilliance of the musical numbers.",1145577600,,910,4.658385093167702

1231180,5,B00000IXOR,"Holy COW! I don't even know what to say about these Judy Garland sets- (I purchased both).  I have been a fan of Judy's for a long time now.  I remember distincly walking into a Saturday Matinee (video store) years ago- and they have movies playing on the TV's in the store- they were playing ""Summer Stock"" and Judy's performace of ""Get Happy"" came on - I stood there mesmerized!!! Aside from ""The Wizard of OZ"" that was the only Judy Garland movie I had seen.  From that day forward I have watched ALL of her movies and picked up all the reputable biographies on her as well.

I recently decided to order myself the Judy Garland Box Sets 1 and 2- why it took me so long to do so - I have NO idea...I think perhaps I was more a fan of her movies and seen many clips here the there of her TV show...In a sense I am SO glad I did wait this long- as I was able to get both ""trunk like cases"" filled with Judy Garland.  I have seem many a frustrated fan over the periodic releases and then they released part 2 in the trunk caseing.

Regardless...

They arrived and I have been watching them everyday since- enthralled- fascinated- mesmerized!! The show itseld is very good for a variety show - and keep in mind this is from the 60's - so it is mostly song and dance.  Nothing overly fancy.  But it is ALL talent- REAL talent- no lip synching- no half naked dancers!

The Tea with Judy is SO cute- the back and forth discussions are very cute- and having Judy sing is great!

Amazon has a steep price for these sets- but I have to say it is worth every penny if you are a true Judy Garland fanatic.  A casual fan may not appreciate it as much. I got them off the amazon marketplace for close to half of Amazon's price- so shop around.  They were brand new- factory sealed and the price was just right.

The DVD's themselves- you can just tell how much care was put into this set.  The image- crystal clear, the extras. deleted sequences, Judy's flubs- PRICELESS- handy book comes in the 1st set - just all around GREAT.  The packaging is absolutely fantastic- the trunks- SO represent Judy Garland- so cute. However, as I am a fanatic about keeping things nice, and new looking when my sets arrived the boxes were BADLY damaged.  The lids to both Trunk sets were torn in the cornes- im not talking litte tears- im talking TORN all the way.  I sent them back, the next set- TORN again!!!  It seems to be quite common since they are cardboard and if not packed correctly - they can damage easily- the third set was a charm- no tears- all in tact. Not for nothing but when you pay the amount you do for these sets- who wants ripped up boxes???

If you are a fan of Judy Garland- these sets are a MUST HAVE",1134950400,14,2699,4.203883495145631

1231182,5,B00000IXOR,"With every viewing ""The Judy Garland Show"" Collection seems to get better and better. Garland was so great and with so many fine guests you notice more and more each time you see it. This is the best DVD purchase I've ever made.",1099526400,7,228,4.325581395348837
1231183,5,B00000IXOR,"This boxed set is absolutely fabulous.  From the trunk-like box to the wonderful liner note booklet to the highly informative paperback ""Rainbow's End"", the production values are of the highest calibre.  As for the TV shows, outtakes, and commentary by first producer George Schlatter, all I can say is that I am absolutely blown away by the incredibly wonderful entertainment value of these shows.  Judy Garland is positively mezmerizing in her every second on screen - you can't take your eyes off of her.  Her voice is absolutely perfect in every single song, and watching these TV shows gives you the feeling that you really get to see the real Judy Garland - as close as we can ever come to knowing the real person, not confined to the restrictions of a movie role.  This is by far the best DVD boxed set I have ever seen, and worth every penny.  I will enjoy these performances by Judy Garland for many years to come - they are timeless, classic, and tragically heartwarming.  You can clearly sense the struggle that Judy was enduring to overcome the immense obstacles that CBS was imposing on her, as well as the inner demons that she had fought all her life.  The makers of this DVD collection deserve immense gratitude from every Judy Garland fan.  Judy would be proud of the way in which this collection has been presented.  First class.",1086134400,11,1347,4.669491525423729
1231184,5,B00000IXOR,"The engineers of this DVD set have done a remarkable job of restoring these kinescopes. It is bright and clear as if they had been shot this year.
The clarity only  accentuates what a brilliant performer Judy Garland was! It is such a joy to see these shows that were made before I was born.",1041638400,6,291,4.290909090909091
1231185,5,B00000IXOR,"I have been a long-time fan of Judy Garland.  My favorite movie is The Wizard of Oz, and I also love Meet Me In St. Louis, The Harvey Girls, Love Finds Andy Hardy, and on and on.  However, until I got this boxed set, I had never seen Judy's television series.  I was simply blown away by the shear talent of the woman.  She didn't sing songs; she interpreted them.  She laid out her emotions raw for all to see with every note.  Even when she wasn't in her ""best voice"", she could still sell a song better than anyone before or since, and yes, I do include Barbra!  The problem with the show was that the network had absolutely no idea what to do with Judy.  At first she was teamed with Jerry Van Dyke, who was supposed to provide comedy relief between songs.  Unfortunately, the two had no chemistry, and the writing was decidedly unfunny.  Blaming Van Dyke, CBS fired him.  Sad, yes, but the show improved.  Then a new format where Judy would trade banter and stories over tea with her guest stars was launched; sometimes it was brilliant, sometimes not.  Always brilliant, however, was Judy Garland, whether bringing down the house with her amazing voice, talking about Old Hollywood while digging through her trunk, or just manipulating what would normally be a mundane story into something hilarious and magical.  This Judy is not the tragic Judy you read about or see portrayed on TV by Judy Davis or Andrea McArdle--this was one funny, talented lady.  What a shame the show only lasted one season, but the one season is chock-a-block with ""rewatchability"".  Judy's guest stars included Tony Bennett, Vic Damone, Count Basie, Lena Horne, Jack Jones, Ethel Merman, and, of course, Liza Minnelli. The show was video taped in black and white with the latest state-of-the-art cameras of the time, giving the show a sleek, sophisticated look.  The DVD transfer makes the most of this and is absolutely stunning. You also have the option to listen to the original mono soundtrack or a new 5.1 version. The set also comes with the book Rainbow's End by Coyne Steven Sanders, which details the history of the show, and is extremely informative.  The set contains fourteen complete episodes, including some outtakes and alternate takes.  Some of the other shows in the series have been released seperately, but I am hoping for a second boxed set to complete my collection.  Unfortunately, my favorite episode, The Christmas Show, is not included here, but can be purchased separately.",1038614400,6,2482,4.768149882903981
1231186,5,B00000IXOR,"Forget your troubles, c''on get happy! This four DVD set contains 14 episodes from Garland's historic (but ill-fated) 1963-64 CBS TV series -- that's more than half of the 26 programs that were taped. Remastered and restored to pristine brilliance, this is Judy at her very best, singing tunes she made famous and sharing the spotlight with such famous folk as Lena Horne, Ethel Merman, Tony Bennett, Peggy Lee, Ray Bolger, Steve Lawrence, Count Basie, Mickey Rooney and her daughter, Liza. The bonuses are terrific: more than 15 never-broadcast outtakes from all the shows; a paperback edition of ""Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show;"" photo gallery and press shots never before seen and audio commentary with people involved in the original broadcast of the series.",1033257600,7,768,5.152
1231187,5,B00000IXOR,"Depending upon the quality of your home entertainment system, this DVD compendium of Garland's CBS' shows verges on a resurrection of Judy Garland.  Sure, the series features awkward moments thanks to the passive-aggressive politics of CBS Executives Aubrey and Stromberg.  Still, Garland's performances are offered to us as a testament to her genius as an entertainer.  There are so many moments in this collection where she triumphs despite the politics of CBS, gifting us with a legacy of her of genius in which we are allowed to participate so intimately.  Itt would be a joke to pit this collection against THE COMPLETE BONANZA, Judy's competition in '63-'64.
It's imperative that the entire CBS series is preserved and soon finds its way onto DVD and into our homes.  The mere thought that the last show, #26, could present viewers with the audio and visual of outakes such as ""Here's To Us!"" is the Pop equivalent of the restoration of Davinci's THE LAST SUPPER.  Judy is at her best in this collection, for those of us too young to have seen her perform live, it's the next best thing --- don't miss it!",1032480000,6,1111,4.790575916230367
1231188,4,B00000IXOR,"Judy Garland's one foray into series television was not perfect, but that was not entirely her fault. She was more anxious than anyone to make this a success, but the show's producers tweaked and ravaged the show's format so much that it ended up a 'flawed gem' as someone so accurately described earlier. Audiences would've been more than happy to see Ms. Garland just belt out one song after another, but early on her show was a musical variety hybrid, co-starred with 'second banana' dimwit Jerry Van Dyke, and featuring an uneven roster of guest stars. In early 1963 she hit paydirt by featuring her teenage daughter Liza Minnelli, who showed early, raw, talent of her own. Impressive as they are together (performing in burlesque and a medley of pop songs), it is the solo efforts of the 41-year-old mother that really stand out: an up-tempo version of ""Come Rain Or Come Shine (staged full-frame to better show off her slimmed down figure),"" and a torchy rendition of ""As Long As He Needs Me (staged behind a trunk on a darkened runway)."" The black-and-white DVD renders a marvelous picture, as these shows are digital transfers from the original, show quality, 2-inch videotapes. Kudos to Pioneer Entertainment!!",1020297600,2,1219,4.922330097087379
1231189,5,B00000IXOR,"I have this collection, as well as Vols. 3-5 and ""Legends"" (aka Vol. 6). I was confused during my research regarding the content and possible overlaps between the various discs that are out there. Now that I've had a chance to review my own copy of the collection (love it), here is some information that might be helpful to others:
There are 4 DVDs in the box:
1. Just Judy compilation & Shows #21 & #22 (The Just Judy portion was recently released individually without #21 & #22)
2. Shows #1, #2, #3, #4 (recently released individually and split into two discs as Vol. 1: Shows #1 & #3, and Vol. 2: Shows #2 & #4)
3. Shows #5, #6, #10, #12
4. Shows #13, #16, #17, #18
Also released individually:
Vol. 3 - Show #15
Vol. 4 - Shows #8, #19, #24, #25
Vol. 5 - Shows #7, #9
Vol. 6 - ""Legends"" is a compilation
So, if you buy the Collection and Vols. 3-6, you will have 21 of the 26 shows. The Collection comes in a case shaped like a trunk. Inside the trunk, you'll find a piece of foam, a Collection insert, and a paperback book in addition to the 4 DVDs. If you remove the foam and the book, you'll be able to fit Vols. 3-6 inside as well...but then what to do with the book? Anyway...
The DVD insert provides an index to the guests and provides the Show # on which they appear. It also indexes each song performed and provides the Show # or #s. The DVD insert indices only reference the discs included in the Collection.
The feature mentioned in the product description for the Collection regarding an index to *all 26 shows* is actually found in the paperback book, ""Rainbow's End,"" which is included inside the Collection box.
Another issue is that the spines of the DVDs in the Collection are labeled Disc 1, Disc 2, etc while the supplemental discs are labeled Vol 3, Vol 4, etc.
If you have the Collection, and Vols. 3-6, the ""missing"" episodes are:
Show #11 - Steve Allen, Mel Torme, Jayne Meadows
Show #14 - Bobby Darin, Bob Newhart
Show #20 - Judy Garland in Concert
Show #23 - Judy Garland in Concert: Music from Movies
Show #26 - Judy Garland in Concert
Shows #11 and #14 will be released on 2/18/2003 in Vol. 7!
Enjoy!",1010016000,18,2129,4.285359801488834
1231190,5,B00000IXOR,"I've heard so many people say that the finest work of Judy Garland's adult career is A Star is Born; as wonderful as it is, I disagree.  Her television show of the 1963-64 season is definitely the greatest work of her career.  Though Judy had only five years left to live, she is in exceptional voice.  Her emotion filled deliveries before live television audiences are awe-inspiring.  Knowing that Judy's shows are preserved on DVD is especially a treat for those of us who were not born yet.  The Judy Garland Show Collection box set is amazing - 14 of 26 episodes, outtakes, a beautifully written book about the series, an index booklet of guests, shows, and songs, a link to the Judy Garland Database, and a screen saver, all packaged in a very attractive trunk casing.  The audio and visual quality of these shows is unbelievable; so clear and crisp you'd swear they were taped yesterday.  Some of Judy's guests include Mickey Rooney, Count Basie, Lena Horne, Liza Minnelli and Tony Bennett, to name a few.  It's also interesting to see the changes in the style of the shows due to its three different producers.  Of coarse, best of all is Judy, as Judy, giving some of the greatest performances of her career.  I believe that just as her performance as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz will be remembered as the beginning of her musical brilliance, The Judy Garland Show will go down in history as the final word on the greatness of Judy Garland.",996451200,8,1447,4.6171875

1231193,5,B00000IXOR,"What a great collection--15 hours of the Judy Garland show! The included book was a wonderful, unexpected pleasure of this set--with all the backstage stories of each episode--interesting to read how Judy performed  all the songs on show 1 in just one take! (Before other material was  inserted later.) Or to know that Judy was coming down off an OD just hours  before the Count Basie episode, and yet is simply riveting! You've probably  seen some of Judy's best songs from the show over and over on PBS, but  there are many forgotten gems that are just sublime! (Did you know she sang  'Some People' from Gypsy? Or 'Shenandoah'?) Even when Judy forgets the  lyric she can still play a song (and ad lib new lyrics on the fly) to the  hilt! Yes, some (most) of the non-musical material (like comedy sketches)  is below par. But how great for a JG fanatic to experience the shows in  their entirety. And the guests! Wonderful to see the obvious love between  Judy and Mickey Rooney! Liza Minelli is young but already a powerhouse.  Martha Raye and her hilarious faces as she tries to steal the scene from  Judy. Rich Little's TV debut. A young Chita Rivera dancing a 60's style 'I  Got Plenty of Nothin'.' Ethel Merman belting and playing (old-school) to  the camera while Judy plays to Ethel. (And don't miss the easter egg--the  only time you'll ever hear Barbra Streisand's voice get overpowered--by  both Judy and Ethel!) Lots of outtakes give you the opportunity to watch  alternate takes (I only wish more were included!). The only question is  when will they release the rest of the episodes (like show 9 with Barbra  Streisand)!",962150400,21,1635,4.710247349823321
1231194,5,B00000IXOR,I'm not too much of a fan of the songs that Garland sings.  I'm really much more into Rock-n-Roll.

As one who had never seen 'Judy' live, I apprehensively ordered Volume One of the Judy Garland Show. From the second Judy opens with 'I Feel a Song Coming On' I was hooked. Stunned. Overwhelmed. I ordered this boxed set. It's even better. The pictures are astoundingly crisp and sharp, in fact it's hard to believe it's off videotape! The resolution is light years ahead of any VHS tape - in fact it's so good you can pick the (few) slightly out of focus shots better than the camera operator could! The pictures have excellent texture and contrast ratio- there are very few video releases that can come under such scrutiny on an 8 foot screen. This 39 year old release looks better than most stuff shot yesterday! If the pictures are stunning, the audio is simply dazzling! The Dolby digital soundtrack is a masterpiece in audio transfers. But it would all be pointless without the real star of the show. Judy. Isn't it ironic. We spend thousands of dollars on sophisticated home theaters,projectors that can show 2 million colors, Dolby 5.1 sound, the best speakers we can afford......... And this nearly 40 year old black & white boxed set makes it all worthwhile.  Finally someone has got it right, congratulations to Pioneer for what is, in my opinion, quite simply the best release, of the best artist, of the century.",953251200,23,1492,4.669201520912548

1231203,5,B00000IXOR,"The new DVD collection of ""The Judy Garland Show"" is long awaited by most Judy fans. The collection for the most part showcases many exciting songs done only the way Judy could. The best thing about seeing  this collection is watching Judy sing which is almost as intriguing as  listening to her. Her sense of direction and energy not only builds to  explosive levels but takes you completely away from reality into the world  of Judy Garland! Another amazing observation is that if you look at Judy's  costumes and hair style she was portrayed so ahead of her time that she is  still very ""IN"" and will never be forgotten or lost in time. But  be careful here....there are times when even the most hard core Judy fan  can get bored as scenes with Jerry Van Dyke for example drag on and should  have been left out as, aside from being part of the original show, are  dated and not very amusing which leads one to wonder what he was doing  there in the first place.

I too bought a DVD Player for the sole purpose of basking in the wonder of this collection. Flawless  sound quality and video too. What a joy to see not only Judy performing, but  also to catch the glimpses of Judy being Judy: interacting with her melange  of guest stars, improvising her way around disaster, laughing at herself.  In short: being the wonderously engaging woman that she was, out from  behind the masks of movie roles. Only one gripe: the rather jumbled index of  content in the program booklet, and the lack of executive creative talent  credits for each show (God knows it was a revolving door.) But the styles  of the various regimes were palpable and it would add interest value to  have them clearly delineated. All in all, a stellar offering. Also, it's  great to share it (in small doses at a time) with non-Judy-ists. They seem  quite surprised and enchanted by her unyielding sophistication and genuine  wit. This collection shall garner lots of fresh converts, I guarantee. Also  the wardrobe offers a fashion feast. Edith Head, Ray Agyahan, Bob Mackie...  the essence of '60s show-biz chic! I eagerly await release of the  as-yet-unreleased shows: i.e. Barbra, etc. I do hope La Streisand hasn't,  in some greedy way, blocked its release! I also hope that Liza, Lorna &  Joey (not just Mr. Luft) are profitting in some way from this venture. It  would only seem fair! If you don't have it yet, GET IT.

""Was"", an interesting glimpse at what may have happened to Dorothy and also includes tie-ins with Ms.  Garland's life and death, by Geoff Ryman. 5.

The most unforgettable moment on the DVD collection has got to be Ms. Garland's rendition of ""A Cottage for Sale.""

There is literally a visible emotional transformation that she undergoes between numbers. Just incredible!
It wasn't until today that I accidentally discovered the commentary by Mr. George Schlatter, the show's original producer.  The ONLY drawback to the series is that it was shot in B&W, instead of color.  I wonder why?

Judy Garland has to be considered one  of the most durable women in history, since when you read the marvelous  book describing this TV series, you are left believing that this woman came  close to death many times during the making of this series.  The outtakes  are incredible. However, I have two criticisms.  First and foremost, why  are these shows not presented in the order in which they were made?  This  set contains shows 1-6 and then skips right to 10. They are not even  presented in order of airdate, which would not be the recommended way to  watch them. Only watching them in the order they were made allows you to  see why Jerry Van Dyke was dumped after show #10. He is easily one of the  most limited and annoying so-called comedians of all time.  My second beef  is with the producers of this show for not making it in color.  What were  they thinking?  All in all, a great set, but whoever decided that this set  should be scattered episodes instead of the first 14 should be fired.",944784000,5,1175,4.4575471698113205

I  believe it is under the ""audio options"" on side one of disk  three. On all the other disks, the audio options consist of 5.1 stereo  sound or the original mono.  On one side of one of the disks, hitting the  audio option icon will reveal the commentary option.
Now wouldn't it  have been great to get Liza and Lorna and Joey in a room and have them  share their thoughts with Judy's legions of fans through a scene specific  commentary.

1231214,5,B00000IXOR,"A must have for any fans of great performers.  Judy is better than we remember.  Over the years everyone has dismissed the series as a disaster.  This collection proves the opposite.
Yes, there are moments when  things go wrong and there are moments when the support players are simply  awful.  Through all of this Miss Garland triumphs and is completely  mesmerizing.
A wonderful way to relive the season of 1963-64 when these  shows were originally broadcast.  They truly don't make them like this  anymore and we are all the sadder that they don't.
The set is  exemplary, especially if you read the book while watching hte programs.  This is particularly illuminating.
The set advertises a commmentary by  George Schlatter (originaly producer).  I could not find it anywhere.  Ok  Pioneer, own up is this a boo boo in an otherwise perfect set?",943142400,15,846,4.8936170212765955
1231215,5,B00000IXOR,"This new set of the Judy Garland television series has got to be one of the best things that could happen to a Garland fan. The quality is exceptional. I'll bet the shows didn't look this good on the dates of their  initial broadcast in the early 60's! Judy's program still holds up all  these years later. As I said to a friend of mine who is not a fan of Miss  Garland's, even just to watch the guest roster. Judy had some of the all  time greats on her show. From Peggy Lee to Lena Horne to Ethel Merman to  Jack Jones. Can't wait for the second set, scheduled as I understand, to be  released in the spring. Try it, you'll love it!",942883200,16,635,4.080645161290323

When they re-enact Judy Garland's hobo performance of Somewhere over the rainbow it touched your heart. I shed a tear that she never seemed to find the happiness she sought. Just a great movie.,",1502582400,,299,4.660377358490566

Judy tries to get by on awkward ad-libs.  But like other Judy Show episodes, this has fascinating moments and the lure of a ""train-wreck"" at times.",1453334400,,303,4.537037037037037
