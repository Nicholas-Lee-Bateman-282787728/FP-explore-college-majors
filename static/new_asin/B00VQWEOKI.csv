7607345,4,B00VQWEOKI,I don't know why this movie did not get more hype. I really enjoyed it. It was way better than I thought it was going to be. I love movies on the water. This was a real good survival movie.,1460505600,2,189,3.75

7607347,5,B00VQWEOKI,"I actually screwed up and ordered this as a streaming rental from a ""channel"" that charged more. I thought the movie was very good and enjoyed it very much. Didn't catch the ""true story"" aspect til the end and wonder how much ""license"" the script writer took with the real situation...but as presented it shows what men are capable of in truly dire circumstances. Not quite the most amazing feat of long term survival and one would think that a seasoned boat operator could have had a general idea where they were by simply viewing the stars and even with my now 40 years ago Boy Scout skills I could have rigged up a compass......but I don't want to pick apart a true ""feel good"" movie that was well acted and displayed a great story line. Though I wish I would have rented my streamed video thorugh Amazon and saved a buck, it was well worth the price that even I paid. I highly recommend the movie and it is fine for all age viewers in my opinion.",1469232000,,950,4.342696629213483

7607349,4,B00VQWEOKI,"Abandoned didn't leave me scratching my head except for the, ""Why the heck would you want to do that in the FIRST place?"" part.  Having been a career sailor, I can tell you from MY perspective, there's little about the sea I need to see any longer.  Been there, seen it, done it.  But.. this is about this movie.  First, I wanted to watch this because I like Purcell.  He's managed to play some decent roles.  A fairly recent entrant to Hollyweird, Purcell's managed to keep himself quite busy of late.

Survival and friendship don't really go hand in hand.  In fact, in most survival cases, friendship goes out the window quite fast.  Friendship means equality.  In a situation such as this, equality doesn't really work.  This was a really good movie about how to get along and how to survive.  It's not easy but it can be done.  As a movie, this was pretty good.  I'm not keen on ""at sea"" movies because I feel far too many are BS and those that aren't tend to glamorize what's really hard work.

Watch this for entertainment.  Watch this for a feel good movie.  Don't watch this as a 'how to' movie.",1468800000,2,1103,4.407960199004975
7607350,2,B00VQWEOKI,"Falls somewhere between professional and amateur production. The script is odd; without giving away plot points, it's hard to feel any tension over an approaching problem when we already know, by way of flash-forwards, that they get out of the problem. The acting is single-note: men at the breaking point, someone shouting. That's weird when we've only been in the situation for ten minutes; after thirty, it's tedious.",1468022400,,420,5.1911764705882355
7607351,4,B00VQWEOKI,Pretty good movie with a decent plot,1467936000,,36,4.285714285714286
7607352,5,B00VQWEOKI,This movie was so well done I bought the Kindle book immediately and finished reading it in about a day. I do enjoy true life/non-fiction survival stories though - so I will say I'm prejudiced - but this story just held me spellbound.,1467763200,,234,4.465116279069767

7607358,4,B00VQWEOKI,"Based on a true story. A boat captain invites three guys to go with him on a two week sail. Three days into the trip they are hit by a storm which turns their boat upside down. Soon they battle for food & water, and themselves. Surprise ending. Swearing.",1463961600,3,254,4.204081632653061
7607359,5,B00VQWEOKI,A wonderfully true story of the spirit for survival and camaraderie,1463702400,2,67,5.181818181818182
7607360,5,B00VQWEOKI,"Sailing movies are few and hard to make well. This is a good one. While the main story is about the four-men's survival adrift on an upturned trimaran, there are a number of well-timed flashbacks to the backstory of preparing for the sail and sailing the boat through an earlier storm. The interpersonal tensions, as well as the psychological journeys of the men individually and as a group through terrible circumstances, are told with perfect pace and tone. From writing to directing and acting, this is an excellent movie that does justice to harrowing, true events and real people.",1462492800,5,585,4.91919191919192

8747823,5,B00VQWEOKI,Great film. Based on a real event that impacted real lives. It's about survival against stunning odds. Well done and authentically captures the full spectrum of human emotion that must overtake divergent personalities in a claustrophobic atmosphere when one's life hangs in the balance after a catastrophic event.,1527120000,,313,5.541666666666667

8747828,3,B00VQWEOKI,"Not the best but definitely worth a watch!
It starts out like any normal Halloween movie does. With a trip somewhere but today it's the local rumored haunted mine. If you have seen The Descent it's like that but with out the underground people and people supposed to be right outa high school. Can't say anymore without spoiling it!
The characters were okay, the relationship between each is REALLY ODD! The main guy (I can't even remember their names!) he's nothing but a prank pulling jacka%^. With him doing/saying something every minute that makes me want to punch him in the face..well it makes for an aggravating movie!
The action doesn't really start until almost the 50 minute mark and even then it's SSSSLLLOOOOOWWWWW going!",1475452800,,733,4.872
8747829,4,B00VQWEOKI,Not exactly what I expected - thought it would be a bigger budget flick but still a good story. While the acting could have been better the story was good enough to balance out shortcomings. Unexpected twist at the end if you don't already know the story.,1471651200,,255,4.446808510638298
