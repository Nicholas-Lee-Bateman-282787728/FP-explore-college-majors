1261062,5,B00003CWHR,"There are very few films which I would call exceptional, but this 1999 British gem is without a doubt one of them.  It is based on author Deric Longden's story of his relationship with his independent, determined, spunky mother and of his coming to terms with her increasing disability after she suffers a stroke, and it stars two wonderful British actors.  Pete Postlethwaite (Sharpe's Obediah, Brassed Off) puts in a first-rate performance as Deric, a caring son trying to do his best by his mum.  Mrs. Longden is a real treasure (she's such a character!), and she's portrayed splendidly by the late Dame Thora Hird (Summer Wine's Edie Pegden, In Loving Memory), who tragically passed away in 2003 a few days after suffering a stroke herself.  She was 91.
This may sound like the basis for a melodramatic, weepy film (as indeed I feared it was going to be before I saw it).  Certainly, the subject is one which could so easily have been maudlin and depressing (as most Hollywood renditions would have been), but it is actually anything but.  The Brits are wonderfully adept at handling touchy subjects (like death and disability) and are not afraid to infuse them with humour.  The result is an endearing, heart-warming, upbeat film which, despite its subject matter (or perhaps because of it), celebrates a life.  You will be wiping away the odd tear, certainly, but that spark of humour manages to be maintained--right to the end.  Indeed, it's the juxtaposition of such monumentally serious issues with subtly comical (or at the very least endearing) moments that make those moments all the more humorous (not to mention welcome).
The film is only 75 minutes or so in length, but there is more quality packed into that short time span than most films could even hope to achieve in 2 or 3 hours.  Personally, I found it to be so immensely satisfying that, having watched it on television, I immediately sought it out on video.  It really is that good a film and one which I recommend extremely highly--indeed unconditionally--to anyone looking for a thoroughly enjoyable, clean film of exceptional quality that is consummately acted.  Indeed, what more can one ask!",1064534400,15,2169,4.880108991825613
1261063,5,B00003CWHR,"A nearly flawless, and incredibly moving, depiction of gradual loss.  We watch as the wonderful, funny, quirky Mrs. Longden loses her ability to communicate through a series of strokes.  Her devoted son is forced to watch his mothers decline, powerless to help, but struggling to make the most of his time left with her.  The script is funny and affecting, and never sentimental, much like the performances.  Pete Postlethwaite proves he is incredibly talented yet again, conveying more with the simple words, ""Oh Mum,"" than any long tearful speech could do.  Thora Hird deservedly won a Bafta for this role of a lifetime.  A truly wonderful movie, that is not depressing, but life-affirming.",1018742400,7,692,5.079646017699115
1261064,5,B00003CWHR,"Dame Thora Hird and Pete Postlethwaite are so completly the Dotty loving mother and loving though bemused son that your heart is stolen within the first moments of the film.  Carried along as you are through situations that we like to avoid in our lives, that we hope never to face, words and and then the loss of them.  The wrong words bring you to the edge of your seat as you try to catch the idea, the meaning, to open the library of a mind lost in the mist of a stroke.  This could all be so sad and depressing but you are kept smiling and laughing through the heart ache.  I have rarely been more moved.",990057600,10,609,4.135593220338983
1261065,5,B00003CWHR,"This story of the love between a mother and son is one of the most beautifully acted and moving stories I've ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives a stirring performance as an author whose mother, played with matchless skill by Dame Thora Hird, is facing the end of her life. Postlethwaite's performance never reverts to sentimentality but he grips the moments and with the smallest gesture or change in expression conveys all the heartbreak of a son's loss. It's hard to describe in words just how brilliant he is in this role, but the simple act of clutching his mother's purse to his heart made me break down in tears. Hird is wonderfully funny and touching as his eccentric mother who suffers several strokes and loses her ability communicate.  The scenes between mother and son as she to attempts to maintain thesemblance of control and as he struggles to ensure her a life of dignity in the face of decay are wonderfully tender and moving. If you are a fan of great acting, or if you are facing the inevitable loss of a beloved parent, see this movie.",981936000,2,1055,4.641711229946524
7917036,5,B00003CWHR,"Pete and Thora - what a great team.  Such a lovely script, and so subtly played by these two.  This is for anyone who has ever undergone the ordeal of caring for a parent with dementia.",1458518400,,185,4.111111111111111
7917037,4,B00003CWHR,"This successfully treads a fine line.  It deals with the last days of a wonderful, slightly eccentric Mother (Dame Thora Hird) and her loving middle aged son (Pete Postlethwaite), but it has a lighter, more playful tone than that premise would suggest.  Its not that the film looks away from the sadness of death.  It can be tough to watch this life-filled older woman slowly deteriorate through a series of strokes.  But its clear what she will leave behind are a lot of loving memories of her quirky, feisty and funny self.

Occasionally the film does tip over into over sentimentality, and on the other extreme, some of the running comic bits, especially by some underwritten supporting characters get milked way too long.  But in the end, this is a 2 actor show, and Hird and Postlethwaite create a couple of wonderful and memorable characters dealing with difficult issues with love and a laugh along with the tears.",1450569600,,921,4.7974683544303796
7917038,4,B00003CWHR,"Thought it would be a comedy, it's not, very sad in places what Thora & family went through in later life.

7917040,5,B00003CWHR,"Thora Hird is perfect as Longden's confused mother and Pete Postlethwaite  also perfect as Longden himself. There are many very funny moments and some very sad moments, and, being a film about Longden, several cats wander in and out looking perfectly happy and in complete control, particularly the cat that decided he didn't want a bath.
I will watch this many times.",1369353600,,368,4.935483870967742

7917042,5,B00003CWHR,"I don't know why I've taken so long to see this again when I find so much in it to treasure. Perhaps the death of Pete Postlethwaite in 2011 brought me back to it. Dame Thora Hird couldn't be more like the persons we become as we get older, or more like those we care about who leave us behind. This is Masterpiece Theatre at its best. A gentle, whimsical story of mother and son, tragic in loss of mum but magnificent in what they shared.",1326844800,2,439,4.116279069767442
7917043,4,B00003CWHR,"You may shed a tear. You will certainly laugh. The acting between the aging mother and her son is powerfully realistic. This is a situation that is as common as grass in the 21st century society of older children helping their parents finish life on earth. Annie Longden (Dame Thora Hird)is aging and knows it. She even understands she in having a series of strokes which requires nursing care. She picks her own lodgings.

I have prsonally lived through similar situations with my parents and in-laws. This is a very real event in so many lives, and the touches of humor along the way help make it all doable. Great for all ages to see and know about.

Annie's son, Deric (Pete Postlethwaite), married the second time only 2 months ago to a blind lady, so loves his mother that he suffers along with her in the aging process. The journey of the last months and days of his mothers life is the story this writer of the drama writes about. In real life, Deric Longden, the author and screen playwright, wrote the biography as a sequel to his earlier book ""Diana's Story"", the loss of his first wife through a crippling illness.

""LOST FOR WORDS"" as a dramatic television presentation is heart warming, emotional, and in so many ways comic. Thora Hird is the prime reason for the comedy, who plays such a magnificent role, that the character is so believable. She's sassy, has her own way of rationalizing, has a cat named ""whiskey"", and provides the comic lines as equally talented Postlethwaite plays the straight man. The duo is dynamic, tears of joy and sorrow from the same eye. Hird wins a best actress award and the drama wins in International Emmy. Well done.

No subtitles. No extras unless you count movie ads.
This story need to be released again, made available, and with a good film bio of the life of Dame Thora Hird.",1303430400,6,1829,4.584097859327217
7917044,4,B00003CWHR,"Lost for Words is a poignant example of a son's loyalty to a somewhat demented mother , she is funny, clever (in a very illogical manner) and reaches into your heart and stays there! A tender film that will help you understand ties that make love and understanding plausible.",1190764800,,275,4.63265306122449

This film depicts the challenges faced by individuals and families faced with the onset of vascular dementia. What viewers witness is the ideal approach to supportive and loving care. This is a great teaching tool for families and educators. It is a source of what to do and what not to do.
