Since I have to rate it in order to submit it, I am giving it a star. However, it does not deserve any star at all.",1439510400,,264,4.3

8188094,4,B000P0R4EU,"This is a travelogue.  I didn't expect an expose or a documentary, but I was somehow expecting more than I got.

I think it was only about 9 minutes long.  After watching what can best be described as a mini-letter box format, I was glad it wasn't longer.  I will watch it next time on my laptop.

I needed this to see what Haiti looked like in the WWII era.  So I got what I needed.",1188172800,,383,3.973684210526316
