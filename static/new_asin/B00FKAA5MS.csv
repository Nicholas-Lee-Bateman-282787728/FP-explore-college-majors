8616259,1,B00FKAA5MS,"I'm not liking this DVD, seems a photo session of boring models, do not seem real players ... definitely the best jobs were the first four dvds of the gods of the stadium... buy this dvd is a bad investment...",1410307200,,209,4.25
8616260,1,B00FKAA5MS,"This DVD was extremely disappointing.  Each clip was short and fast.  It does not in any way compare to the quality of the 2013 DVD.  The photographer is obviously good, but his work was edited into a quick set of clips no better than what you can find by simply watching EuroSport.  If this wasn't for a good cause, it would be a complete waste of money.  I hope they've learned their lesson for the 2015 DVD.  I've got my fingers crossed!",1408665600,3,440,4.304878048780488

8616262,4,B00FKAA5MS,It is not as good as last year. The models are not as good looking as used to be. It needs more full frontal.,1396051200,2,109,3.5833333333333335
8616263,4,B00FKAA5MS,"While not my favorite in this series (two years ago was the best to me) I think the photography is always interesting and an effort is made to compose a real photograph each time. The rugby players are presented with an elegant sexiness that has strength and sensitivity. However if you are expecting sex rather than sexiness then these videos are not for you. I like that each year it's a bit different so it stays fresh each time out. Again, a lovely effort with lovely results.",1386892800,2,480,4.528735632183908
8616264,1,B00FKAA5MS,"I have finally had it with this series of videos.  While this one is slightly, and I mean slightly, better than last year, it still isn't worth it.  No frontals, and there is WAY too much emphasis on the photographer instead of the models.",1386028800,13,239,4.409090909090909
