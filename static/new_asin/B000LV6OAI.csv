2714464,1,B000LV6OAI,"A Siren In The Dark (2009). Director's Cut. Running Time: One hour, 20 mins.
Directed by Steven Vasquez and Laura Reilly. Written by Steven Vasquez.
 The video begins with a scene of Joshua (Orion Cross) eating soup with some meat in it. Then a scene of Kevin (James Townsend) receiving a call from Danny (David Beutler). There is a scene of Kevin being killed.
  Meanwhile, a very handsome man, Cameron (Todd Tetreault) has a woman, Ariel (Laura Reilly) in his car. She is coming on to him and trying to get Cameron to come into her house. He just wants to get her home safe. Cameron is a cop and turns down her advances. He does have a quick vision of kissing her, but he comes to and says, ""I better say goodnight"". He is suppose to be looking for a missing man. She gets upset. So then he says he will check it out upstairs. She makes a comment that she thinks he is gay. The truth is, Cameron can not have sex.
  The story takes us back to when Cameron is getting information from Danny and the disappearance of his gay lover, Kevin.

Also in the cast: Riley Sheridan, Donnor Tran, Kyle Lankins.

Contains male frontal nudity and female frontal nudity, sexual situations.

This video is just horrible. Bad acting and exploitation, but at least you can eat chinese food with it.
Only Todd Tetreault is moving forward to an acting career after this one.

Filmed in Orange County and Crestline, California.",1388793600,3,1408,4.511811023622047

2714475,1,B000LV6OAI,"""Siren in the Dark"" is easily the WORST movie of any type I have ever seen.  It makes movies like ""Denied"" look like Academy Award winners!  Totally incomprehensible plot (I couldn't figure out who was sleeping with whom or who died, or who the psychic cop was and what he had to do with anything.  There are no actors in sight, only people reciting inane dialogue.  There is no point in listing the flaws in this so-called film.  Everything about it was bad.  Fortunately I was watching it on-line and lost the connection after half an hour.  That saved me from having to turn the darned thing off!  Although I have to admit, I would kind of liked to have seen how bad the rest of it was.

2714477,3,B000LV6OAI,"This is definitely not my type of film, but it still showed a lot of promise.  A psychic detective is tracks down a murderer, discovering debauchery and drug use in a rural area.  Being a heterosexual male, he seems to be the only one not getting laid in this movie.  There's a lot of softcore, male-on-male sex going on.  Full frontal male nudity, but only topless women.  The murders are all in the vein of low-budget, low-gore ""knife across the throat"" style.  This is strictly an independent (shoestring budget) film with corny acting, cheesy lines and just a few sets.  The plot is actually pretty interesting, though, especially for such a low-budget flick, and the directors do some interesting things with the budget they've got.  Considering the supernatural elements, they're probably the most natural-seeming elements of the movie.",1286064000,37,842,5.050724637681159
2714478,3,B000LV6OAI,"Once in a rare while, I'll watch a film and be unable to react to it enough to write an adequate review.  ""A Siren In The Dark"" (2008) is one of those films, in that I initially watched it many months ago, could not relate to it, and simply put it on the bottom of my ""pile"" for a future second viewing.  Having done that recently, I still don't understand everything that the writer-director was going for here but, then again, I have significant suspicions he wasn't quite sure either.

The word ""siren"" in the title is used in the context it appears in Greek mythology, as any of a trio of murderous, shape-shifting seductresses who lured mortals into their lair, and trap them by preying on their lust, greed, addictions and loneliness.  In a nutshell, this is a meandering, dark story of a missing gay teen, investigated by a rather unconventional, troubled pony-tailed rural police officer who has some kind of psychic abilities. The investigation focuses on a strange young man who lives alone in a remote cabin in the woods, maintained by a female benefactor who owns a local tavern and tends to appear mysteriously anytime someone is conflicted. After now watching the film three times, I am still confused about many of the characters and much of the plot.  But I think that's as good as it is going to get.

As indicated in the subject line above, this is an ""Erotic Horror"" film, which seems troubling to me on some level (How does one find something horrible to be erotically attractive?), but it seems to fit.  The erotic content is significant, with both male and female nudity (including occasional glimpses of genitals), simulated sex, B&D, S&M and hints of sex with minors.  There is rampant drug use, drinking, kink, and violence,  If rated, it would be a hard ""R"" at least, possibly an NC-17, which is likely why many retailers are decliming to carry this DVD.  The dialogue is ridiculously stilted and unrealistic, and the characters (even the mortals) seem like zombies with their total lack of acting skills. On the plus side, the photography and special effects are better than one would expect for a low-budget indie film, which makes the ""eye candy"" factor significant.  Overall, I can't give this more than three stars out of five.",1278720000,13,2258,4.73469387755102
