8532534,5,B008YGTE0O,"This DVD contains every episode from the Fourth Series of Thomas and Friends, accounting for 26 episodes, which were originally released in the mid 90's. They are all digitally mastered, so the video looks vibrant, and the audio is clear.

Keep in mind, this is a Region 2 PAL DVD, and made to work for European DVD players/TVs. If you live in North America, you must have a DVD player suitable to play it. It is easy to find programs to set your computer's DVD drive as region free, thus making the playback of this disc possible.",1387497600,,531,4.474226804123711
8532535,1,B008YGTE0O,This DVD was formatted for Europe and would not play.  My son was very disappointed.  I did get a refund but not a version of the DVD that would play here.,1372464000,,155,3.967741935483871
