420380,5,6302038499,"I loved the acting of David Ebert who played the part of the young boy with asthma. I've seen one review that was negative. But I kind of liked enigmatic movies. There was an undercurrent of adultery in this movie in which the woman was secretly seeing the baron. The boy chooses to go back to his father by train to tattle on his mother. He then chooses to change his story and the husband and wife in Vienna Austria get back together again. Sometimes I like a movie that has mystery in it. I hope it becomes available for purchasing through Amazon Instant Video. I would gladly buy it to see it several more times.
I just love understated movies. It may never get a good Oscar review, but these are the kind of movies I thoroughly enjoy.",1362009600,,739,4.323741007194244
420381,1,6302038499,"Maybe I just didn't get it.  I watched the whole movie trying to figure out what was the big secret.  I was thinking espionage or treason, maybe even witchcraft.  Nope, no ""burning secret"" at all.",1353974400,,196,4.542857142857143
420382,4,6302038499,"Subtly but assuredly, this film replicates the bisexual love triangle of Shakespeare's sonnets.  A man (stocky, middle-aged, urbane, sophisticated) befriends and romances both a well-to-do lady and her asthmatic son.  The setting is a sparwling pretty Alpine health spa.  Opening the door of a long gleaming beautiful car, the man captures the sick and lonely boy's interest immediately.  His mother is glad her son has a friend in that depressing place and is charmed by the man as well.  It's possible our war vet hero is using the boy to get to his mother's wealth and company (shades of Hugh Grant's turn in ""About a Boy"") but his amazing rapport with the 12yo, featuring a draped arm and tender affection and an erotic charge in their swimming pool scene, come to the edge of ephebophilia.  This is further affirmed by the tower the two of them climb on the grounds of the spa, a visual reference to the man-boy seduction scene in either ""Turn of the Screw"" or ""The Innocents.""  There is also the poem (Goethe's Erl-King) that the man reads the boy in a scene of riveting emotion.
The reading of the poem (whose subject is illusion) ushers in the movie's turning point.  After the poem is read, with its macabre pronouncement (""The child is dead""), the warm water tap is turned off, and the man begins actly coldly toward the boy and, eventually, his mother as well.  It is as if, during his charged recitation of Goethe, the man spends all his love for the boy in one pyrotechnic finale; he then reveals himself as unctuous, damaged, and unpredictable, a snake in the disguise of a fine storyteller, sophisticated reader, and loyal friend.
A well-acted story of love and longing, featuring an omnisexual charlatan who plays two needy people like a fiddle.",1071446400,34,1761,4.766447368421052

420463,1,6302038499,"Just watched it on AMazon Prime.  Ugh! Awful movie, boring, strange, depressing, making no sense whatsoever--except that a boy seems to be running everyone and is totally clueless about everything, including sex, not that there was any sex in the movie at all.  What a waste of time--at least didn't have to pay extra to watch this ghastly thing.",1470873600,,346,4.8474576271186445
420464,1,6302038499,"Not a very good movie. A man befriends a young boy and helps him adjust in Austria.  Faye Dunaway does not have a good part or much to work with, Klaus Brandauer plays the older man, again wasted talent on a shallow movie. The kid is good, but there just isn't a dynamic plot here.",1470700800,,281,4.109090909090909
420465,5,6302038499,"I had to give this film 5 stars because of Klaus's superb performance. This is a film worth watching several times to catch the subtleties. And his performance is truly charming, seductive, strange and scary. I believe this film is about illusion, and the vulnerability of two lonely and isolated people. The woman in her pampered but emotionally distant marriage. the boy in his too close suffocating relationship with his overly protective mother and lacking a deep connection with his distant father. What I didn't believe in was the chemistry between the Baron and Faye Dunaway. I did not really believe in her performance, as lovely and beautiful and wonderfully dressed as she is. There was no real moments of vulnerability that would have made me believe in the pathos of her situation and her openness to the Baron.
  The transformation of the boy is wonderful as he painfully realizes the cruel heartlessness of the charming baron, and the flawed imperfection of his mother. That he himself sees things that she will not listen to. And then he acts for himself and leaves the scene to return to his father which breaks the illusion for his mother. The end is very powerful as this boy does truly die to his childhood and grows into a man. And the Baron also confirms this, is the first really to admit his defeat. He is outed by the boy who has seen him truly and the baron confirms this generously. He is in it for the chase, not really for the woman and can admire a rival who fights skillfully.  I think the father also realizes more than he says. IN a way both the men in this movie contribute to release this boy from his suffocating relationship with his mother.",1470096000,7,1677,4.620805369127517
420466,5,6302038499,This was a terribly intriguing story that draws you in.  I loved it!  I will have to say it is one of the first movies in a long time that had an ending that left me hanging--- perhaps that was the intent. I would watch it over just to see Faye Dunaway's costuming and the lovely scenic  settings.,1470009600,3,297,4.086206896551724

420468,3,6302038499,"This movie, for me, felt like it was missing something. I kept waiting for something ""torrid"" to happen. The music seemed to lead up to something big but it was all too subtle for this music.  A burning secret or desire, a temptation and manipulation of two lonely people. I didn't understand the attraction to this Barron. He seemed very odd and his relationship with the boy was very odd, at best. This movie is not without it's merits, even if you wonder what it was really all about, one can appreciate a movie about three peoples lives and what happens in the course of two weeks. Also, I couldn't put together the story the Barron was reciting and the connection to the boy...if their was a connection.",1469923200,,708,4.53125
420469,4,6302038499,"I found this pleasing to watch and suspenseful in a quiet way,
 The mother wanted to know she was still attractive, note her questioning gazes into the mirror, then the baron answers her, yes she is attractive, at least for the chase, and the boy just wanted attention,
But in the end it seems to come down to one thing, the poem,""the boy is dead"". yes, but the man is born..",1469923200,,375,4.28169014084507

420527,1,6302038499,"I usually enjoy stories about indescetions, but rhis movie left me ready to turn off the show barely before it started.  I am startled that Faye Dunaway would act in a show with a weak plot, an amateur presentation and poor script writing.  Well, I suppose we all have contractual oblications to fill.",1409788800,,301,4.660377358490566
420528,4,6302038499,"Just watched this 1988 film on Netflix.  What a great actor Klaus Maria Brandauer is.  He really shines in this film.  The only other film I remember seeing him in is ""Out Of Africa.""  His acting is so amazing in this film.  Watch it for him but also for the mysterious direction, script, and cinematography.",1398556800,,308,4.527272727272727
420529,4,6302038499,"Whoa!  The reviews are all over the map on this one, so I thought I'd throw my opinion in too.  First of all, I bought a couple of Zweig books, but was tempted to watch ""The Burning Secret"" before reading it, so - I won't be comparing the film to the book.  I don't know (yet) what psycho-sexual overtones might burden the novel, but I didn't ""get"" any kinky vibe between the Baron and the boy... sorry, just ain't there.  Two males of any age can dress in a locker room (or whatever you call the changing area at a 1920's Austrian health spa), and it's okay!  The Baron isn't the only adult non-paternal male who hugs the boy ... actually, it's Mom's doting that I found more disturbing that the Baron's interest in the young man.  Is the Baron creepy?  Yes!  Is the boy needy?  Yes!  Is the boy's mother wound tight?  Yes again.  It's not spoiling anything to say that the Baron is - from the outset - using the boy to get in Mom's ... business.  (What's all this about going after her ""money""?  Maybe the clue for that was one of the German asides that the adults speak to each other under their breath; I dunno.)  The ""Burning Secret"" - in my humble opinion - is simply what the boy learns about the failings and faults of adulthood.  Did you feel let down - even betrayed - when you learned the truth about Santa?  Well, it's kind of like that.  I felt the Baron's creepiness was come by rather honestly (a WWI veteran, with lingering physical and psychic injuries).  I felt the boy's neediness was honest too (distant father, smothering mother, with his own ailment).  Fay Dunaway's a great actress, but someone else might handled her role better.  How some reviewers can give this movie only one star is beyond me.  Maybe you won't like aspects of the film, but it's beautifully shot.  And Klaus Brandauer does an amazing job as the Baron.  (The fourth star is for him alone.)  I say give this one a try!",1396051200,,1911,4.3760683760683765
