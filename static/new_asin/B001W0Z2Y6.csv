8599381,1,B001W0Z2Y6,"This DVD was not useful for me. I already knew the information and there was useless advice pointing to other DVDS. I didn't spend this much money to be pointed to spend more money. It's a waste of time and isn't even useful for professionals. If it wasn't too much of a process, I'd ask for a refund!!! If you see this Amazon, I'd stop selliing this DVD and make that company refund everyone who bought it.",1325116800,,407,4.298701298701299
