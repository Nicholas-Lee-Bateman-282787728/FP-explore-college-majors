4510510,3,B004ZOF48U,"Ok I picked up this film because I just bought a 3d TV and I like horror and 3d. My first impression, What is this asylum company and where are all these 3d films they advertize? See it seems like they advertized a large collection of previews like 10+ I think ALL in 3d. everything is in 3d here, I mean everything. the previews, the behind the scenes features everything. I was sad to find out that all of the films they advertize are not available in 3d blu-ray some only on dvd and not in 3d. but I digress.

This film is not noteworthy. I wanted to like it because I liked what seems to be a mid level b-movie studio with a lot of interesting films,putting their feet in the water of 3d-blu-ray and darn it I want to see some of those preview movies in 3d blu ray, but this film is dull. The scares are well just not there. They are either so telegraphed your like ok come on already or so quick you could literally turn your head and miss them.

The 1st few minutes of the film are actually probably the best part of the film. It is scarier and even has a bit jump out of your seat chills there. After the opening story is done and you get to see the main characters come in, the movie just loses that tension it had in the first set-up story and sadly never gets it back. I didn't totally get this for the film but for the 3d and here I did like it.

THE 3D:
1st like I said before the whole disk is 3d. put on your glasses as soon as you hit play because all of the previews are 3d and cool to watch. (Even the copyright warning is 3d) Actually the previews may be more fun then the movie :). The 3d in the film doesn't have alot of jump out at you 3d and works best with some cool depth shots and a creepy house interior. I really liked the making of feature. After hearing a ton of times how great this director is, you get a real in depth discussion of the camera they use and how the 3d process works and the challenges and since the feature is also in 3d it makes you really feel like you are behind the scenes even more.

FINAL Thoughts:
Watch the previews and first few minutes of the film and you will have an enjoyable time, but the movie will let you down the longer you watch. This is a film that I still think is worth a buy in a very weak 3d content market right now. I actually hope the studio continues to make more movies from their catalog in this format because they got the 3D down and it's nice to have a stream of films that aren't just blockbusters and documentaries. looking for a good horror film look elsewhere, looking for something to add to your 3d collection and you could do much worse.",1318377600,28,2624,4.05984555984556

They took a Discovery Channel documentary that was scary as hell and turned it into the worst piece of amateur trash.  Not only was it not scary, but the only reaction I had was pity for the actors who had to suffer throught the making of this trash.

Although it's not about popping out at you mostly , it's about depth mainly, still many 3d flicks were shot in 2d and then processed and will never look as good as this one does, other than a few titles , this is TRUE 3D. The movie which was shot on a low budget (ohter than the 3d)  in California , is a average haunted house movie , and it's actually alot better than most asylum titles! (the company that made this one).  The acting is decent and the story is standard , but the added bonus of having a true 3d picture is good enough reason for fans of 3d to own this , I am a fan of low budget horror too so this is a good purchase for me on that level too.",1359763200,2,820,3.875

4510527,2,B004ZOF48U,"A Haunting in Salem (Shane van Dyke, 2011)

Bill Oberst Jr. (The Secret Life of Bees), the lead actor in A Haunting in Salem, recently posted an apology for the film via his blog. Not necessarily for the film itself, but for his performance in it (he did not specifically name it, but it was obvious what movie he was talking about), claiming he should never have taken the role, because it wasn't right for him. ""I knew I was wrong for the role,"" Oberst writes at billoberst.com, ""but I took it anyway. That was unfair to a great cast and crew who deserved better."" He also says ""The role in question...generated the only bad film reviews I have had in 4 years and 56 projects.""

Allow me, as I so often am, to be the voice of dissent here, because I thought Obsert's performance in the otherwise mediocre A Haunting in Salem was actually pretty darned good. The fact that he wasn't the average-joe clean-cut hero-type made him more compelling, to me (after all, you can put a hero-type in a crappy movie in a role very similar to this and still have it turn out a dog. We can even match the profession--did you catch Costas Mandylor in exactly this type of role in exactly this type of movie in 2010's The Cursed? No, you didn't, and believe me--you are the better for it). His reactions to the ridiculous goings-on around him seemed perfectly natural; if you're not a bit confused when the supernatural starts whaling on you, then you're not quite a member of the human race.

As for the great crew... well, the movie was directed by Shane van Dyke, directing his fourth mockbuster for The Asylum (he is, and deserves to be, most infamous for his first, the execrable Paranormal Entity). This guy is a proven loser working for a studio whose entire existence comes from making quick-cash-grab ripoff pictures. Mr. Oberst, you gave them a helluva lot more than they deserved. * ",1357344000,2,1880,4.553254437869822

Hard to look at, hard to watch his acting, and what on earth was he doing with a barely 30's wife with good looking teenage kids? All we could talk about during the show was how bad the casting was. Next, where's the house that's on the movie jacket? Where's the 3D effects? My 65 in.

4510535,2,B004ZOF48U,"This movie was awful. Bad graphics, bad acting. The actors they chose didn't even go together. The father looks like he is a 60 yr old married to a 20 something yr old. The mother acts more like a teenager herself than a mother of 2 teenage children. I just couldn't picture them as a realistic family.  The daughter ends up getting sick and throwing up all over the place and it never occurs to the parents that maybe their daughter should go and see a doctor.

There is just so many things that don't go together in this movie. I couldn't help but laugh at the end where the father gets pushed out a 2 story window, falls head first, gets up and goes back into the house. He sees his son hanging by his neck on a chandalier and walks on past him with barely a glance. He finds his wife dead and (im not exgerating) actually looks like he is about to laugh but quickly follows it up with an act of sadness. Then leaves the house and doesnt think of getting his wife and son down from the ceiling.  He also seems to care more about his wife then his children, when usually it is the other way around.  He then proceeds to drench the house with gasoline,  purposely pouring gasoline on his son and wife (didnt make sense to me).

This whole movie is just a mess.",1346371200,3,1261,4.190082644628099

Thank God I only spent $1.00 rental on this one which was still too much. I can't believe they spent money filming this in 3D. Nothing like the Amityville Horror which blew this movie off the map. And to say this piece of crap is better than A Haunting in Conneticut you need your head examined. Pass this one by on your video rental shelves.

4510537,4,B004ZOF48U,"This is, above all else, a B-movie horror flick, but I thought it creepy enough, although my wife didn't (I have my suspicions that that's just because it was in 3D, but that's another story). There's enough of the cheap horror film scariness, gore and plot twists to keep it entertaining. If you're not into that kind of thing you probably won't like this. But this film was shot beautifully as far as the 3D goes. Every shot is visually very interesting. It doesn't really have a lot of the so called OOS (Out of screen) effects that other reviewers seem to live for, but to me those actually detract from a 3D film. What it does have is 3D effects in nearly every shot. Many 3D movies can leave you forgetting the film is shot in 3D (Resident Evil in 3D comes to mind); not this one. I'm not sure how this is done exactly, maybe they increse the depth of field by using a high f-stop on the lens, but you really get a pronounced 3D effect in the vast majority of this movie. All the scenery and actors pop. Next time I watch I'll pay more attention to the sterographers' credits (3D cinematography) to see what else they've shot. This is how it should be done, at least in that respect.",1344211200,,1189,4.3125

First off the movie is supposed to be based in Salem, MA though it was actually filmed in Pasadena, CA.  The landscape and fake, cheesy ""Salem"" sign in the beginning initiated that saying ""the writing is on the wall"".

4510548,3,B004ZOF48U,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

There are about 12 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer, a pot handle at 15% and the same leaf at 20% 4 times in a brief period.

The in-screen 3D is vivid but pushed to the limits most of the time. Pushing the 3D to the limit for an object at 1 depth seems to have caused MINOR 3D defects at other depths 13 times. Additionally, 10 times there were easily noticeable 3D flaws in the background. Don't get me wrong, this film is a keeper as long as you don't mind the lack of OOS effects. With more (3D) camera time and better stereographing, I expect some awesome 3D from Asylum in their future.

MY 3D RATING = GOOD to VERY GOOD, 3 1/2 stars (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

The acting isn't great (the kids do a much better job than the parents), the story isn't original, the directing is probably the worst part about the entire movie, but it's fun, it's not pretentious and there's a huge audience for B horror flicks like A Haunting in Salem.

The featurette was cool, it's obvious these people know they're making a B movie. That's kind of the point, we get to see in the 'making of' that they are laughing along with us. So criticizing it for not being a masterpiece film is sort of self-deprecating.",1318464000,29,883,4.553459119496855

8450308,2,B004ZOF48U,"OPENING SCENE:

There is nothing like a bad Asylum film. The opening scene we have the camera panning up the stairs as if something is going up. A man is drawing a bath. Now in case you missed the stair panning scene, they repeat it. The next thing you know someone is holding the guy's head underwater and suddenly a steamy mist is coming from the tub.  After mom has a fatal encounter with Saran Wrap, the sheriff shows up and rather than report the crime, opts to burn down the house, but fails and is pushed out of the window which proves to be 50% fatal.

We flash forward to 60 years later. There is a new sheriff in town (Bill Oberst jr.) who we notice was a burn victim, something that was never really developed or played a major part of the film. He has a wife Carrie (Courtney Abbiati) and two teen kids (Jenna Stone  and Nicholas Harsin). Now we get the bad plot fillers. This house was built in 1692, but remodeled so it doesn't look old. It was owned by Judge Corwin who ordered the death of the Salem 19....buried on the grounds which also was the location of the courthouse (which BTW was located downtown and was an inn).

The haunting figures were scary looking but were in scenes that lacked the build up and scare factor. The acting was Asylum grade and the characters weren't developed, especially the son who really doesn't factor into the film until the end. And why does the sheriff and his wife sleep in their clothes?
