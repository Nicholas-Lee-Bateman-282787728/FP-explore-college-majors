8531712,2,B008XAT0QY,"I'm am only writing the review for Hollywood Homicide, I was really surprised and greatly disappointed in Harrison Fords use of The Lord's name in vain throughout the movie. It was not necessary. I usually enjoy Mr Ford's movies but not this one.",1443744000,,246,4.744186046511628

8531716,3,B008XAT0QY,I bought this pack because I had see Hollywood Homicide on TV some years ago and I wanted to see it again. I did watch all four but right now I cannot remember anything about the other three. So basically what I am saying is that if you don't have a special interest in at least one of these movies then don't bother.,1408752000,,317,4.0476190476190474

8531718,5,B008XAT0QY,"Action all the way around here. My favorite is Hudson Hawk, but I like them all. My husband never falls asleep watching these.",1387238400,2,126,4.521739130434782
8531719,5,B008XAT0QY,"I am an avid movie watcher and collector (own about 500 unique movies). Thus, I love these new 2-4 movie compilation packs, and this one is great. Some of them are one rated 7-10 movie with the rest being 2-5 at best so this was a real treat (especially for a Mill Creek product.)
Being the worst of the 4 (and the only movie I hadn't seen before), LSSoM still had a few good laughs. Very good performances were put in by Joshua Jackson, Jaime King, and the always funny D.J. Qualls. With a bad plot and confusingly stupid script it is the definite weak link of the four.
Hollywood Homicide has an interesting if not completely impossible set of characters and plot. It has some humor and a little action but ultimately ends no where close to neither Josh Hartnett nor Harrison Ford's best performance or movie. It is mildly entertaining with the dysfunctional people, partnership and circumstances.
The Fan is a great movie with a very dark and strange plot. Robert De Niro, of course, puts in an amazing performance/character study on how a dark and obsessive person invests themselves too deeply and eventually snaps. Wesley Snipes has had better performances (Jungle Fever, New Jack City, White Men Can't Jump, Blade Trilogy, et. al.), but considering the horrible direct-to-DVD movies (if you can call them that) he's doing recently, it ranks in the top 20% for him. Overall really good and dark movie.
Hudson Hawk is the real catch in this set. I know it's a cult-classic, real-life cartoon/comic type movie, but I personally like it. Bruce Willis is amazing as the singing, dancing, slick cat burglar turned savior of the world. Danny Aiello is awesome as the older but equally charming mentor/partner. Their relationship and quick-wit is what really carries the movie. It is very over-the-top and the characters are sometimes overly caricatured, but it only adds to the charm of this movie. Even if you end up hating it, this movie is a MUST watch.
Overall great 4.5 compilation of movies that is well worth the price compared to some of its contemporaries.",1363046400,5,2065,4.787114845938375
