8538390,2,B009AHO10O,"This still isn't accurate history, but it's not as much fantasy as the movie. It's very graphic for small children, however. Most of the movie centers around the Russian revolution, and the family in captivity. As other reviewers have noted, the family is marched downstairs and you hear gunshots for each person. Anastasias body is seen, held by Alexander, with a gunshot wound to her chest. There's no blood, but i don't even think children will have trouble connecting the hole in her chest to the gunshots they heard earlier. She is, however, saved by some sort of medallion she was wearing. Rasputin sings a song while he's leading the revolution, just after the family's murder. Very tasteless. The animation, voice acting, and abundance of songs honestly wasn't that bad. The ending was a bit anti climactic. There wasn't much resolution, it just stopped.. I just don't think the revolution and the Romanov family in captivity leading up to their murder was a good plot choice, but I guess the filmmakers wanted to try and be more accurate to history, or just separate themselves from 20th Century Fox film instead of copying the story outright. This is better than another budget anastasia film I've seen, but considering the Fox film is now in the $5 bin at Walmart, and this film still doesn't accurately represent Russian history, there's no reason to buy this for your children. Just show them the Fox film, and if you're worried about the skewed version of history, buy them a history book, or Google it for them.",1425168000,3,1526,4.82824427480916
8538391,1,B009AHO10O,"The animation is sloppy, with plenty of errors and skips. The voice acting is bad, the music is generic. It looks like they slapped this together in a week or so just to push it out. I know this is a kids movie, but they also got such an insane amount wrong it's unbearable. I also question the target audience given that they only loosely hide that the family was murdered. The ""We're going on vacation"" bit may have been more convincing if they weren't surrounded by angry people with guns, and and you hear a *bang* for each person when they get off screen.",1399420800,,560,4.3428571428571425
8538392,1,B009AHO10O,"Rasputin is portrayed as an evil drunk rebel spy with magical powers.  He takes a lead role in ensuring the imprisonment and murder of Anastasia's family.  Although you don't witness the actual murder, the family is marched downstairs just before you hear gunshots.

Don't be fooled by the Rainbow Brightesque cover.  This is a terrible movie for children under 10 or so.",1384560000,4,371,4.935483870967742
