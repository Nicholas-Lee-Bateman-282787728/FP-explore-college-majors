732169,3,6303937357,"1996 was when the WWF began to get some real momentum going again after a few pretty bad years recovering from the losses of Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, and Ric Flair.

While this PPV is certainly erratic, it also has a lot going for it.  (Matches rated on a scale of * to ****)

Ahmed Johnson Vs. Double J/Smoking Gunns Vs. Body Donnas-  Two totally forgettable matches.  Like I said, they wern't completely on track yet.  *

Razor Ramon Vs. Goldust- People tend to forget how much real heat Goldust had going into this match, and it was shocking at the time that he won the IC Title.  Both men are certainly in their prime at this point, and despite the anticlimactic ending, this match tells a good story.  ***

Royal Rumble Match-  If you could sit through any Royal Rumble match from 1993 to 1995, you're stronger than I am.  This one at least has a lot of really great wrestlers in it: Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Yokozuna, Vader, Steve Austin, Triple H.  It's very entertaining.  ***

On a side note, to me the highlight of the PPV by far was the return of Jake 'The Snake' Roberts.  The ovation he gets gives you goosebumps.  It's a shame that his comeback was so unsuccessful due to the sterilization of the character, as well as his own failings.

Bret Hart Vs. The Undertaker-  It's too bad this match is not that good; Bret Hart was probably peaking and The Undertaker had not had such momentum going into a World Title match since his first in 1991.  Unfortunately, the style of these two men just don't click; they both need someone a little bit faster paced to have a great match.

I liked that it was implied that Undertaker would have pinned Hart though, they at least gave him that as he would not capture the WWF title for another year.  **1/2

The Royal Rumble PPV's would steadily improve for the next few years until about 2001, this fun event shows a step in the right direction.",1132617600,,1900,4.443478260869565

732171,3,6303937357,"This was a split event with half good and half bad matches. The good matches though were good enough to save the pay-per-view. Here are the matches.

1. Double J vs. Ahmed Johnson 8/10

A decent opener, but it was way too short. It was funny to see Double J get beat up real bad by Ahmed Johnson. Ahmed Johnson also took a real hard fall from the top rope trying to do some high-flying move too. The ending sucks with Ahmed winning by DQ because Jeff Jarrett (Double J) hit Ahmed with the guitar.

2. Skip and Zip (The Bodydonnas) vs. Billy Gunn and Bart Gunn (The Smoking Gunns) 7/10

An okay match. I was not expecting much from this match anyway, but it had a few really good moves in it on the part of the Smoking Gunns. The Smoking Gunns retain their Tag Team Titles.

3. Goldust vs. Razor Ramon 8/10

This match really good. It was good to see both of these good wrestlers fight too. There were a few good moves but towards the end it started to get a little boring which made it seem like it was long (which is not good). The ending was kind of suprisng with Goldust becoming the new WWE Intercontinental Champion. It happened when the 1-2-3 Kid came from the crowd and went to the top rope and kicked Razor Ramon REAL HARD! That allowed Goldust to get the pin and the victory.

4. The Royal Rumble 9/10

This was a good Royal rumble. A lot of people say there were no- namers but I knew most of them except for like 5 people I did not know. Other than that it was fun. Stone Cold Steve Austin made his Royal Rumble debut here as well. Some of the highlights was when Henry Godwinn threw some nasty stuff at Jerry Lawler, Jake The Snake Roberts coming in and letting his snake out and all of the wrestlers clear the ring (under the ropes). When this happened Jake put the snake on Jerry Lawler, and then Jerry Lawler hid under the ring for like 30 minutes until Shawn Michaels eliminated him with a hard punch. Some more higlights was when Shawn Michaels eliminated Vader and Yokozuna simultaniously. Shawn Michaels wins this Royal Rumble (which made it two years in a row) by eliminated Diesel (superkicked him over the top rope!). Good Rumble.

5. The Undertaker vs. Bret Hart 7/10

This was a real bad main event. It had a couple of good moves but that did not save it. These two guys also faught a lot outside too. This match was way too long as well, it was like 30 minutes long! The ending sucks when The Undertaker wins by DQ because Diesel came. Bret retains his WWE Title.",1109980800,,2488,4.274468085106383

7855787,5,6303937357,"1.) Jeff Jarrett vs Ahmed Johnson

This match came about after Jarrett had attacked Ahmed the previous month at the In Your House PPV. Ahmed rushes the ring after Jarrett and starts hammering in the corner but Jarrett escapes. Jarrett re-enters and tries to wear down Ahmed with strikes and a headlock but Johnson powers out of each one and takes Jarrett down with a clothesline and follows it up with a series of slams. For some reason, Ahmed felt the need to yell with each slam and takedown he did. Johnson misses a clothesline on Jarrett to the outside and gets his hand stuck in the ropes. Jarrett takes advantage and gets Johnson down on the outside. Jarrett gets Ahmed back in the ring and tries to take him out with a series of double arm axe handles off the turnbuckle, but Johnson no-sells them and makes a comeback. Johnson ends up going to the top turnbuckle and attempting a senton bomb off the top, but Jarrett moves and Johnson crashes hard, hurting his right knee. Jarrett capitalizes and locks on the Figure 4 Leglock. Johnson manages to reverse it but Jarrett escapes and goes for the Figure 4 again, but Johnson reverses it, kicking Jarrett to the outside. Jarrett grabs his guitar, goes to the top turnbuckle, and dives off, slamming the guitar through Ahmed's head. Ahmed recovers after the match and chases after Jarrett.

Todd Pettengill interviews Diesel about the Royal Rumble. Diesel says it's his time, says he didn't agree with Undertaker being named #1 Contender for the WWF Championship, but says he doesn't care who he faces for the championship if he wins the Rumble. The interview was slight foreshadowing at Diesel's role in the main event

2.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The Bodydonnas (Skip and Zip) w/Sunny vs The Smoking Gunns (Bart and Billy) (c)

The match starts off with a nice flow, the Gunns end up getting in control, causing Sunny to try and use her womanly ways to distract them. Some nice, quick and clever teamwork from the Bodydonnas gets them in control over Bart, but the momentum quickly changes once more, as an impressive tag/double team move from Bart and Billy takes Skip down. Sunny accidentally gets knocked off the apron after Billy gets sent off the ropes. Billy goes out to check on her, but in an old school cliche heel move, it was a set up as it lead to a 2 on 1 attack from Skip and Zip. This ploy allows Zip and Skip to get the advantage over Billy inside the ring for a little while. Billy eventually makes the hot tag to Bart who cleans house. Some antics take place nearing the end, but Bart manages to counter a suplex into a small package pin on Zip for the win

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Goldust w/Marlena vs Razor Ramon (c)

This match was initiated by Goldust's usual mind games. Supposedly having a thing for Da Bad Guy, Goldust was consistently sending Ramon gifts in the form of roses and a centerfold of Goldust. The Bizzare One even went as far as to get Ramon's name tattooed on his heart. This was going to be a good match! Marlena made her WWF debut here, accompanying Goldust to the ring, smoking her cigar. This was another fast paced match with the momentum constantly shifting between Goldust and Razor. Lots of consistent taunting and stalling from Goldust directed to Razor. Goldust using Marlena as a human shield, throws Razor off long enough to get Goldust in control of the match. Goldust distracts the referee while Marlena goes near Razor and blows gold dust in his eyes. Razor makes a comeback from a sleeper hold with a few slams, but it's not enough to keep Goldust down. Marlena enters the ring and distracts the referee as Ramon sends Goldust down with a back drop off the turnbuckle and prepares to finish him off with the Razor's Edge. Before he can, 1-2-3 Kid enters the ring and takes Ramon down with a spinning wheel kick from the top turnbuckle. Goldust capitalizes and pins Ramon for the win. Mr. Perfect on commentary perfectly (no pun intended) says that Goldust has all the gold now. Great match-up here! As an avid fan of Scott Hall, this was one of his best and probably underrated matches from WWF.

4.) 1996 Royal Rumble Match

There were 5 favorites to win the Rumble here and they were Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Shawn Michaels, Diesel, and Vader. Hunter Hearst Helmsley enters #1 after losing a match to Duke the Dumpster Drose in the pre-show in a battle for the #1 vs #30 spot. #2 is Henry Godwinn. Bob Backlund enters at #3. Lawler at #4 who convinces Backlund and Helmsley to work with him to take out Henry. Lawler grabs the slop bucket and prepares to pour it on Godwinn, but Godwinn attacks, retrieves the bucket and scares off the 3 heels to the outside. Godwinn takes the bucket and throws the contents of it on Lawler, Helsmley, and Backlund on the outside. Jake the Snake Roberts made a surprise return at #7. Roberts who was beginning a born again Christian gimmick, had replaced Damien with a new Albino Burmese Python named Revelations. The first favorite, Yokozuna enters at #9 and throws Backlund out, making the first eliminated from the match. Yokozuna and King Mabel (#6) fight each other for awhile, while 1-2-3 Kid comes in at 10 and is chased down by Razor Ramon in hot pursuit of the Kid. Ramon tries constantly to get his hands on the Kid but Kid outruns him each time before Ramon is assisted to the back by officials. Vader, another favorite enters at #13. Owen was next at #17 and Shawn Michaels followed out next, returning to a huge ovation at #18. Michaels gets a major pop when minutes into entering the match, single-handedly eliminates both Vader and Yokozuna. HBK eliminates 1-2-3 Kid almost right after. An irate Vader re-enters the ring and throws Michaels over the top rope, but because Vader is no longer in the match, HBK is still in. He clears the ring of everyone before being sent to the back by officials. The final favorite, Diesel comes in at 22. The final 4 come down to Shawn Michaels, Diesel, The Brtish Bulldog, and Kama. Michaels clotheslines Bulldog over the top, eliminating him. Diesel forces Kama over the top to eliminate him, and Michaels follows up behind and superkicks Diesel over the top rope to win the 1996 Royal Rumble. For the second year in a row, Michaels won the Royal Rumble and was heading to the main event of Wrestlemania 12. An furious Diesel attacks Bulldog at the walkway in a bitter rage. Diesel re-enters the ring and looks ready to fight Michaels but instead high fives him and takes his leave while Shawn celebrates his victory. But it wouldn't be the last time on this show that we saw Big Daddy Cool. Overall this was a fascinating Royal Rumble match. While it was obvious that Shawn Michaels was going to win, it was still played out perfectly

5.) WWF Championship Match: The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer vs Bret Hart (c)

Diesel walks past Undertaker as the Deadman makes his way to the ring and shoves Paul Bearer. The 2 start brawling on the walkway, with Diesel becoming really heelish here. Once the match begins, Undertaker starts out with the advantage at a slow pace, working over Bret in the corners, even whipping him hard into the turnbuckles, causing Bret's back to connect with the turnbuckle hard each time. A face claw hold wears Bret down early. Bret gets his legs around the rope, forcing Taker to release the hold. Undertaker follows up with an Old School off the top rope and goes back to the face claw. A reversed irish whip into the steel steps gets Bret control of the match. Bret gets Taker in the ring and begins working over his legs with a series of holds that seem to last forever. Taker escapes a leg lock, slamming his leg into the face of Bret before sending him to the outside. Taker begins choking Bret with cable cords, getting boos from the crowd, while Paul Bearer distracts the referee. Undertaker heels it up a bit more, throwing Bret over into the timekeeper's table and assaulting The Hitman with a chair.  Once back in the ring, Bret regains momentum and goes back to Taker's legs, receiving a mixed reaction from the crowd. Undertaker makes a comeback, but Bret is there to put a lid on it each time. Bret starts to get dirty, removing the padding from one of the turnbuckles and removes Taker's Phantom mask. Bret slams Taker's unmasked face into the exposed turnbuckle. Bret tries to leap on to a groggy Taker, but Undertaker catches him and drops Bret with a Tombstone Piledriver. Right as the referee makes the count, Diesel returns and drags him out of the ring. As a result of this, Bret is DQ'd for Diesel's outside interference and Taker wins the match---but not the championship. Diesel gives Undertaker the middle finger and heads to the back and Undertaker takes off in hot pursuit of Diesel. Overall, this was a fairly good match with plenty of time. It ran just a bit too slow at times. I think Taker and Hart's match with each other the following year at the 1997 SummerSlam was much better

Overall: The 1996 Royal Rumble was a spectacular one. It was one of the best Royal Rumble PPVs and it was an awesome show to officially kick off the Road to Wrestlemania 12 that would take place in March. Every match delivered and lived up to its hype. Shawn Michaels winning was the right choice for the Rumble and it was topped off with a plausible WWF Championship match. 1996 was going to be a wild year in WWF",1452211200,,9895,4.880357142857143
7855788,4,6303937357,"The Ahmed Johnson-Jeff Jarrett match was a good/solid brawl with a ""Smashing"" ending to make it sweeter. The tag team title match between The Smoking Gunns(Billy & Bart) & The Bodydonnas(Skip & Zip) was a classic back-and-forth bout. The IC title between Goldust(Dustin Rhodes) & Razor Ramon(Scott Hall) was a fun & entertaining match with a ending that you will get a ""kick"" out of. The Royal Rumble match while not a bad bout,it had some dumb moments like Jerry Lawler running under the ring after seeing Jake Robert's snake and HBK winning the thing was kind of predictable & obvious. The World title match between Bret Hart & The Undertaker was a good solid bout which was ruined by Diesel's interference. I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1279497600,,742,4.67175572519084
7855789,4,6303937357,"Another old WWF tape that I found in my collection in the 1996 Royal Rumble. During this time, Bret Hart was the WWF Champion who was taking on all comers but seemed to run into his stiffest challenge yet in The Undertaker, who was the number one contender. Also, Shawn Michaels was making his return to see if he was capable of doing what he did the year before & that was win the Royal Rumble one more time. On top of that, Goldust was playing mind games with Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon who had continuing issues with the 1-2-3 Kid as well.

Ahmed Johnson vs Jeff Jarrett. This was Jarrett's last WWF match till about late 1997 before going to WCW but this was more of a showcase for Ahmed as he over-powered Jarrett throughout this match before Jarrett got himself disqualified by hitting him with a guitar off the top rope.

WWF Tag Team Champions The Smoking Gunns vs The Body Donnas. For those that don't know or remember, this version of the Body Donnas was Skip (who was ECW's Chris Candido) & Rad Radford. A great tag team match between these two teams with the Donnas actually using some great tag team tactics by cutting the ring in half at times before the Gunns did the same thing to counter their offense.

Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs Goldust. The storyline here was that for months, Goldust had been trying to get the attention of Razor to the point where he even wrote him a letter. The psychology of this match was worked out great as the early stages of the match had some comedic stalling with Goldust playing more ""mind games"" including a moment where he did a waist lock but decided to just rub Razor's chest. Once that got out of the way, this was a solid contest that went back & forth before the 1-2-3 Kid interfered to cost Razor the title & set up their Crybaby match a month later.

Royal Rumble Match. Most fans consider this to be the worst Rumble ever but I heavily disagree as I really enjoyed this one. Moments include Triple H lasting the longest in the Rumble, the debut of the Ringmaster (Steve Austin), Razor Ramon getting his revenge on the Kid, the WWF debut of Vader who actually came in & dominated the Rumble for the most part before getting into a confrontation with Yokozuna that lead to the surprise moment of Shawn Michaels tossing both men over the top rope at the same time which lead to Vader snapping & going back in to eliminate everyone in the Rumble including a confrontation with WWF President Gorilla Monsoon, Jake Roberts returning & clearing the ring with his snake & even placing it on Jerry Lawler that scared him to the point where he was under the ring for most of the Rumble. Shawn Michaels would go on to win his second Rumble in the end.

WWF Champion Bret Hart vs The Undertaker. Before the match started, there was a brawl in the entrance way between Undertaker & Diesel due Diesel being angry about being eliminated from the Rumble. Once that was done, this was the more unique performance that the Undertaker had at this time as both men worked well together & put on a great wrestling match with Taker working on Bret's back & even using moves he had not used before including a claw hold while Bret just targeted the leg with aggression that played a factor at times during the match. The ending was a bit of a jib with Diesel interfering to cost Taker the title but it didn't take away from what was a great match between these two that would be topped by their series in 1997.

So in the end, this Rumble did a great job of continuing storylines (Razor/Kid) as well as starting up new ones (Diesel's official heel turn that lead to his feud with Undertaker, HBK's quest for the gold at WrestleMania, Vader/Yoko) while delivering a great action throughout making this one WWF event that I would go out of my way to see.",1240876800,2,3813,4.463414634146342
7855790,3,6303937357,"Jeff Jarrett VS Ahmed Johnson-A good opener with Ahmed looking impressive, including Johnson diving over the top rope and nailing Jarrett with a cross body block. The ending sucked with Jarrett coming off the top rope and hitting Johnson in the head with a guitar.

Bodydonna's VS Smoking Gunns-A good match that also included anther over the top rope cross body block. The ending was awesome.

Razor Ramon VS Goldust-Good story going in and the match had alot of stalling. It was a decent match up and the action picked up towards the end. 1-2-3 Kid nails Ramon with a spinning heel kick from the top rope and cost Ramon the title. Overall, enjoyable but not much of a match.

The Royal Rumble: The worst Rumble ive seen yet, and ive seen everyone of them. It had alot of good wrestlers but a few wrestlers who never even competed in the WWF. Shawn Michaels wins it again but I could care less.

Undertaker VS Bret Hart: A decent main event and Diesel ruins the Undertaker's chance of winning it.

Overall, not much of a show. First two matches were good, the IC title match was more story telling and show then wrestling, the Rumble sucked, and the main event had a crappy ending. They did make up for it at WrestleMania though.",1222473600,,1230,4.5225225225225225
7855791,3,6303937357,"Royal Rumble 1996 began the birth of the era of the Heartbreak Kid so a speak. Michaels won his second Rumble match here. Undertaker and Bret Hart gave an unbelieveable match for the main event.

1. Jeff Jarrett vs. Ahmed Johnson
This could have been a good match but it was average and nothing more. Jarrett did his dirty tactic moves and Ahmed pulled off some impact slams. The match did had a good guitar smash at the end. 2.5/5

2. Tag Team Titles
Smoking Gunns vs. The Body Donnas with Sunny
This was the donnas ppv debut I believe and they had a very good match with Bart and Billy. Bart and Billy also had some miscues with each other cause of Sunny. A tag match worth a watch here. 3.5/5

3. IC Title
Razor Ramon vs. Goldust with Marlena
Quite an interesting and fun match to watch. Goldust was all about his little funny and unusual inring techniques which he is known for. Cheap tactics was used by Goldust to get the advantage over Razor. Goldust and Razor had a nice match up. 123 Kid would hit Razor with the heel kick from behind and cost Razor the match. 4/5

4. The Royal Rumble Match
This Rumble match wasn't great but it was good but it also felt like something was missing for some reason but it still was a good rumble.

Triple H had an awesome showing from entering number one and lasting nearly 50 minutes. Most of the throws over the top rope came at good spots. You would even forget about the fact that the King hides under the ring for about 30 minutes. HBK also had a good showing and he especially spiced things up once he entered the match. Steve Austin entered this rumble as the ringmaster and he too gave a nice performance. But the true highlight was when Vader and Yokozuna got in each other faces. The last elimination was great. Like I said, not a great rumble but this surely is one of the better ones. 4.25/5

5. WWE Title
Undertaker with Paul Bearer vs. Bret Hart
This is one of those matches which Taker fought with that mask he wore due to the injury he suffered from Yokozuna. Before the match got underway, Taker and Diesel had a brawl which began their fued and led to their match at Mania 12, but Taker and Hart certainly delivered another classic. I felt this match was better than their Summerslam match but not better than their one night only match from the UK. Taker's leg takes a mouthful of punishment in this one. Hart just really torques and beats on the leg of Taker. Great action inside and outside of the ring. Couldn't ask for anything more and the dq from Diesel didn't hurt the match whatsoever. The deadman and the hitman delivers another classic match right here. 5/5
