8676705,1,B00N9XCBZC,"This was very disappointing. We had watched the entire series via rental from Netflix and I bought this set for my wife for Christmas. We began watching the series again now, and the first two seasons played, in beautiful crisp detail, but when we put on series 3, from the same set, it would not play. All the discs after that refuse to play. We tried the discs from the first two sets again and they worked fine. I have  a player for all regions, and it has never given trouble with any Pal discs. I particularly bought this set in Pal on the recommendation that they were better than the American one. It is too late to return now, and we are stuck with only being able to view the first two seasons and the Christmas special. Please note the one star rating I have given it is not for the content, we love the series.",1508889600,,821,4.229299363057325
8676706,3,B00N9XCBZC,"So I didn't realize that you couldn't watch this on a normal US DVD player bc of the way that it reads discs until after I bought it. You can still use it with a laptop (make sure you say you live in Britian when you ask) or PS4 (although it makes you change where you say you live and there is a limit to how many times you can change that) but it doesn't always play as easily as a normal US DVD would.

Overall it worked and I saw the first 5 seasons for 20$ so good deal",1483833600,,474,3.74
8676707,5,B00N9XCBZC,"Can't believe 'interested amateur' rated the show on here, giving it one star. It's suppose to be a rating of the PRODUCT not the show.",1482105600,,135,4.44
8676708,2,B00N9XCBZC,"I was purchasing this as a gift for my French speaking elderly mother who has a difficult time hearing English in her old age.  This is NOT in French!  I found it using the Amazon search words :"" Downton Abbey in French"".  After waiting weeks for delivery from Europe and buying a region free DVD player, I was very disappointed to find out it was not in French.  Amazon needs to make this language issue very clear.  It was basically a waste of money and time.",1468368000,,461,4.313953488372093
8676709,5,B00N9XCBZC,This complete collection of Downton Abbey includes the London Series and is impeccable. These discs are not knock offs. Do yourself a favor and buy a mutli-region DVD player or multi-region DVD/Blu Ray player and enjoy this wonderful series.  Anything but five stars is unjustified.,1453420800,3,282,5.266666666666667
8676710,1,B00N9XCBZC,It was not what it purported to be. The London season special was missing and my player reported errors due to the software used to create the discs.,1435017600,7,149,4.357142857142857
8676711,1,B00N9XCBZC,"I used to love Downton Abbey.  But in season 4 they spent who knows how much to bring in Kiri Te Kanawa the famous opera singer to play Nellie Melba the famous opera singer who was too big a star to play house parties to play a house party, the only dramatic purpose of which was to drag everyone into one room so that Anna Bates, a beloved character, could be brutally raped in the kitchen of a house where otherwise no one ever had any expectation of privacy and her screams couldn't possibly not be heard.  That's just cheap, sleazy soap opera emotional manipulation, not respectable drama.",1428537600,2,593,4.481481481481482
8676712,5,B00N9XCBZC,"The set this review was written for is the UK release of Downton Series 1-5.  This is in Region 2 format and you will need a Region Free or Region 2 DVD player to play it.  Also, it does not include the Christmas Special 2014 episode.  The US version of this set, when it is released, will be Region 1 (USA) and will include the 2014 Christmas Special.  You may well find this review attached to the US set, as that is what Amazon tend to do!

Series 5 of Downton Abbey follows the established tradition by being closely followed by the DVD set covering all the episodes to date. This includes the 42 episodes so far. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each of the others, plus the 2011 - 2013 Christmas specials of which the first was a dramatic masterpiece, but the others have struggled to reach the same heights. It was a hard act to follow! We have yet to see the 2014 Special in the UK, which is the last episode in Series 5, so regrettably it is not included in this set which has been issued before it is aired to get the Christmas sales.

The five series so far have taken us from 1912 to 1924 and an exciting ride it has been. Series 1 started just after the sinking of the Titanic and a major feature was domestic concerns such as finding suitable partners for the Downton daughters, whilst the second series took us into quite different territory as Downton was converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen. This series took us on to the end of the World War in 1918. We then enjoyed the first Christmas Special Edition which was probably the strongest single episode, and featured a very dramatic trial.

Series 3 went from 1918 to 1920 as the family adjusted after the war and life returned to more as it was in Series 1. However, there were financial pressures on the estate and it was clear that it needed to adapt to survive. Some members of the family embraced change more than others. The following Christmas episode saw the Crawley family in Scotland but finished in an unexpected tragedy which cast something of a pall over Christmas Day for those in the United Kingdom who saw it on the day.

Series 4 takes us further into the 1920s and it is clear that there has been some adjustment to the boundaries between those above and below stairs in terms of the rigid division which was clear in Series 1. The Christmas Special concerns the `coming out' of Lady Rose which is a quaint English customs by which young aristocratic ladies are introduced to society. Finally Series 5 is set in 1924 just after the election of the first socialist government in the UK. Romance is very much in the air, and in rather unexpected places!

To my mind Maggie Smith as the family matriarch has been the outstanding performer throughout with her witty and caustic comments although there have been many strong performances. Hugh Bonneville (Earl Grantham), Michelle Dockery (Lady Mary) and Jim Carter (Carson) spring to mind, but to single these out is to do injustice to many others. The extra features on the individual DVDs of the individual series are also included here so there are several hours of these in addition to the screened episodes.

If you have been an avid follower of Downton Abbey since the beginning then four years on it is probably an excellent time to revisit the earlier episodes as we are currently doing. However, if you are not acquainted with the series then you really should get hold of this set. You don't know what you are missing!",1427673600,11,3501,4.5340729001584785
