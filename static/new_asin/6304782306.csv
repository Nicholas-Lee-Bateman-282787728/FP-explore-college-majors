7878522,4,6304782306,"This ""Rolling in the sky"" 50 min. DVD shows the worldwide famous U.S. Navy flight demostration team, as you always wanted to. The footage is just great, so; you can enjoy some amazing shots of Blue Angels complete maneuvers, from different angles, several times. Zoom-in and zoom-out you'll watch jet rolls, loops and high speed air crossings, keeping their wing tips just a few feet apart. The entire DVD will be a ""jewel"" of your aviation collection, that's for sure. There's no narrative along the movie, only few live words of Team's leader officer, while all 6 pilots attend the briefing room, giving the movie a more realistic touch. I think music is a minor detail (that's why I gave just 4 stars), but; there's also some real fly-by jet noise, improving movie soundtrack. No doubt, this is the definitive Blue Angels flight demostration movie, showing no military or U.S. patriotic allegories, just the Blue Hornets flying high... Any aviation fan will enjoy this DVD, once and again.",1107302400,2,992,4.910714285714286
7878523,5,6304782306,"I felt like I was at a Blue Angel airshow!  While there was no narrative, it was very easy to follow the action.  Good, crisp shots of the FA18 Hornets doing their stuff!  Will someone please do a similar DVD featuring the USAF Thunderbirds and their Lockheed Martin F16s?",980899200,4,272,4.510204081632653
7878524,3,6304782306,"If you like firework shows where you can sit back and ""oooh"" and ""ahhhh"" what you will see, then you will like this video/DVD. There is no narration, so you are free to fill in what you see with your  own thoughts. This does give it a ""home movie"" effect, however,  as if someone took their video camera and filmed the inside of the plane,  the outside, and all kinds of different in flight angles. There are places  where some narration would be helpful, as we have no idea what is going on  in a briefing room. Watching this video will not give you any idea of the  history, or what it takes to be a Blue Angel. You just sit back and watch,  and watch, and watch. There is no sense of bringing this to a conclusion.  If you like just blue angels without any background info, you will like  this. You should get some background info, and this one falls short in this  area.",952128000,3,874,4.210843373493976
