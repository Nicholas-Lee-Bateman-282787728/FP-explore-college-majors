8322946,4,B001N2WJ26,"Okay, so I'm not gonna lie.  The main reason I watched this movie is because the main bad guy, Yasunori Kato, was the inspiration for Bison from the Street Fighter games.  Street Fighter of course being the single greatest video game series of all time(don't deny it).  If you want to hold that against me, feel free to do so.  But I gotta say, Bison's inspiration is one bad dude.  He's the kind of villain you really love to hate.  It's no surprise that he's inspired so many other bad guys that came after him.

In fact, I'd say that Kato's presence is the driving force behind this film.  To be honest, the scenes that didn't have him didn't interest me that much.  I'm not entirely sure why.  This movie has all the things I love.  Sorcery, demon possession, evil spirits, etc.  All good stuff.  Plus, the special effects are deliciously old-school.  Some people might think they seem fake by today's standards, but I love them.  But somehow, I feel like something was missing to make this a truly great film.  Maybe it was too much talk and not enough action.  Or maybe it was something else.  One of the previous reviewers mentioned how it doesn't quite capture the feel of the novel.  I'm not familiar with the novel or its history myself, but I suppose that must be the main problem.  Maybe something got lost in the transition from paper to screen.

In any case, this is still a good movie.  Lot's of cool, magical stuff is going on, a lot of ""Wow!"" moments, and like I've said, Kato's just a really awesome character.  If you're someone who's really into Japanese culture(like I am) then you might wanna check this out.  If you're not, then I'm sorry to say, you probably won't be too interested.  It's a very Japanese film, and if you're not into that sorta thing, you're not gonna get it.  Otherwise, you may want to look into it, because it is a pretty cool film.",1353456000,,1877,4.463126843657817

8322948,3,B001N2WJ26,"Before I begin, I just want to acknowledge that this is a VERY confusing movie and difficult to recommend to average English viewers. It's based on an extremely long novel published only in Japan known as ""Teito Monogatari"" (""Tale of the Imperial Capital"") by Hiroshi Aramata. The original novel is basically a huge retelling of the history of Tokyo from the turn of the century all the way up to the next millennium, but done from an occultist viewpoint. It was notable for being a pioneer of the ""fantasy occult boom"" that dominated Japanese pop culture in the late 80's and early 90's and was hugely influential (see the ONMYOJI films, which were based on books written in the wake of this novel's popularity).

The novel is composed of 12 volumes each around 250--500 pages in length. But that's not all. There is an unofficial 13th volume which serves as a side story (and was also made into a movie). Is that it? No. There are also prequel, several spin-off works (such as THE GREAT YOKAI WAR, made into a film by Takaashi Miike) and ""series analysis"" books, and a another huge retelling in the form of ""Shin Teito Monogatari"" (""New Tale of the Capital""). So yeah...this series has its roots in Japanese literature far more than it does in films.

The movie is very ambitious in that it attempts to adapt the first four books of the series (1000 pages covering 20 years of history) to the screen in only a 2.5 hour time span! Not even one of the multiple ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptations have never tried that kind of compression before!! So if the story feels like it's moving along too fast; it's because there's WAY too much ground to cover. For example the characters that populate the story will not have much identity unless you know their historical origins (many of them are based on real famous people who lived during that time period) and their roles in the original novel.

The main problem is the film is that it wants to be a profoundly entertaining blockbuster at the cost of a cohesive narrative. From the moody overblown intro sequence with its stirring Wagner-esque orchestral score to the explosive pyrotechnics filled finale, it's clear the movie was looking to cash in on big budget noir gothic Hollywood SPFX filled blockbusters that were dominating theaters around that time, such as POLTERGEIST (1982), ALIENS (1986),  and BATMAN (1989). But the source material it's adapting is extremely detailed, large and simply unfit for the blockbuster medium.  The world the story is creating is as well as the time span of the narrative (over 20 years) is simply too big for a 2 hour production.  Likewise the narrative of the film simply does not give enough to to introducing the audience into it.  As admitted by the original filmmakers in their 2015 commentary for the Blu-Ray release of the film, the main way this movie can be really enjoyed is as a supplement to the original novel.  Unfortunately, despite selling over 5 million copies in it's native land, that work has never been translated outside Japan.  Thus, English speakers who are not fully bilingual are kind of screwed and will not find this movie a satisfying experience.

But I love it.

For one thing, it's a unique film.  The combination of epic source material, culturally relevant history and mythology, and unique art design resulted in a film that stands as a unique specimen.  While it's true that many of the staff and cast of this film would later be involved in far more commercial productions like the later GODZILLA films and the endless RINGU series; here they were dealing with something completely different. Although advertised as a horror flick by ADV's misleading promotional material, the production is really a genre-bender of a movie: equal parts horror, fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction. Thus you get a few scares, some elegant fantasy film imagery, and even some education about Japan's early 20th century history to boot.

Visually the film is (to quote another reviewer) hypnotic. The special effects could have been better; some of the practical monster effects were terribly primitive even for the time.  However, like BATMAN, the real star of the show is the art design.  At the time, this was probably the most expensive Japanese live action fantasy/special effects film to have been produced with a budget of over 1 billion yen.  Much of that money was spent on the meticulously constructed costumes and sets.  For example,  an entire 150 meter open set reproduction of the early 20th century Ginza district shopping center was reconstructed from scratch: buildings, people (over 3000 extras!), cars and all; purely for use in the movie!  Although that might be the crowning achievement of the set design, you've got to remember that the film is an epic that occurs over the course of 20 years.  So we get to see the visual transition of the buildings, costumes and people as Japan makes the incredible move out of the Meiji Era into the Showa Era.  Most Japanese period fantasy films are Jidaigeki works generally set somewhere in the distant past (like the 1600's) amongst feuding daimyos and samurai with stories that occur within a very short time period.  This motion picture covers the expanse of the late Meiji and early Showa periods (end of the 19th century to mid 1920's).  When you consider how obsessed the filmmakers were with meticulously creating this unique, gothic reinterpretation of two decades of Japanese history (that are rarely explored in fantasy productions), you'll realize how the movie really does seem unique in the oeuvre of Japanese fantastic cinema.

I'm also quite serious about the parallels I find with this film and John Boorman's EXCALIBUR--both are epic fantasy narratives which take place over decades; both were directed by filmmakers renowned for stylistic eccentricities (John Boorman and Akio Jissoji's), both feature some wonderful classically trained actors (Nicol Williamson, Patrick Stewart, Shintaro Katsu, Ko Nishimura, etc.) in primary and supporting roles; both films make heavy use of classical music throughout the production; the content of both works revolve around darker modern representations of classic mythology and folklore and both films are just visual feasts to admire.  Both works even have similar flaws, like frantic time lapses and some awkward choreography.  Although the filmmakers have compared this work to David Lynch's DUNE for it's compressed narrative and emphasis on special effects, I think the culturally relevant, mythical nature of the work makes EXCALIBUR ultimately the better parallel.

The gothic horror component is borrowed from classic vampire movies such as F.W. Murnau's NOSFERATU and the various Hammer films. There is also some influence from more modern supernatural thrillers such as EXORCIST, especially evident in the possession sequences. Kyusaku Shimada, the actor who plays Yasunori Kato, the main villain of the movie, became famous overnight due to his performance here. An imposing sorcerer decked in the rainment of a early 20th century Japanese military officer, Shimada's Kato can best be described as a combination of a menacing gestapo officer, Christopher Lee's ""Dracula"", Ted Cassidy, and Max Schreck  (his stiff, unearthly, rigid gestures and body language seem to be a blatant nod to Shreck).  His presence alone was a draw for many audiences and is one of my favorite things about this movie.  Some more recent Japanese reviews I've read have even cited his character as the ""closest thing Japanese cinema has to Darth Vader"".

And apparently I wasn't alone in my resulting awe when I was watched this movie. The movie itself was a box office hit in Japan when in it was released. Some magazines even went so far as to call it the ""best Japanese science fiction production of all time"" (wow...) Many contemporary stars of Japanese cinema got their start here and owe a lot to this movie.  The character of Yasunori Kato became an icon in Japanese popular culture, inspiring the likes of modern day Japanese pop culture characters in the anime/manga/video game realm such as the imposing M. Bison of the internationally successful STREET FIGHTER franchise and Raidou Kuzunoha of the beloved cult franchise SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI: DEVIL SUMMONER.

But that doesn't translate into immediate recommendation over here.  As I said before the absurd density of the film's plot and the story's reliance on foreign esoteric subject matter will most likely make the story incomprehensible to Western viewers.  Had the source material or its other adaptations been translated first, then Western viewers may have had more of a background to understand the plot.  But without that background, the uber complicated narrative will just seem kind of a mess.

Another problem that will harm the film's reputation in the West is the simple fact that it's outdated.  Popularity in Japan functions like popularity in the West.  Along with it's source material, the work may have been groundbreaking back in its day, but that day was almost 30 years ago.  Since then the production has had numerous successors since then which have practically overshadowed it.  To understand this situation, think about Tim Burton's original BATMAN film.  Although that work was regarded as a groundbreaking cultural phenomenon for comic book adaptations in it's time, many comic book and cinema fans nowadays consider it kind of silly and outdated.  Successors such as Christopher Nolan's DARK KNIGHT film trilogy and the flood of other comic book adaptations saturating the cinema have overshadowed it.  Likewise, TOKYO: THE LAST MEGALOPOLIS helped inspire a new wave of occult focused fantasy media in Japan, but has had many successors and competitors in the decades since.  Some examples include the aforementioned ONMYOJI film series, the J-Horror boom, M. Bison and the gazillions of anime/manga dealing with similar occult subject matter.  Pretty much all of these successors have overshadowed the original work in terms of popularity.  Many of the topics the film helped popularize are simply taken for granted in Japanese fantasy fiction today.

The ultimate solution for the Western viewer is that they must be open minded.  The film itself was an experimental product, pushing to impress different people of a different culture in a different generation.  Unfortunately Westerners don't have the benefit of nostalgia since the film itself was never released until relatively recently.  If you can be open minded enough to tolerate the incomprehensible plot, the old special effects, etc. and maybe then you'll be able to enjoy this entertaining cinematic relic which will fill a big gap in your J-pop culture history.

DVD: If I was just rating the movie, the score would be much higher.  Sadly, ADV's current release of the film is pretty awful so I had to bump the score down to a 3.  Mediocre picture quality and bad sound transfer all contribute to making the experience feel a lot cheaper than it really was.  What's really unforgivable however are the subtitles.  In an attempt to simplify the story for an English audience (I guess), they refused to translate or spell out the esoteric Japanese terms (such as ""onmyoji"") and instead replaced them with generic terms like ""psychic"".  Any person familiar with Japanese mysticism will tell you that an ""onmyoji"" (Yin Yang diviner) is NOT interchangeable with ""psychic""!  Misspellings abound: En no Ozunu is spelled as ""Enno Uzunu"", and ""Feng Shui"" is spelled out like the Japanese pronunciation ""fusui-sui"" instead of the more generally accepted English term.  This film really needs a new release, better technical transfer and a translation by people actually willing to explain the esoteric references instead of disguising or ignoring them.  That probably won't happen for a long time though (if ever)...",1335139200,12,11883,5.08179012345679
