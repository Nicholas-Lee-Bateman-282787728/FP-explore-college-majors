8442156,5,B004USTAG8,"Steve Cronin is a great teacher in the ""fast & loose"" style of watercolor painting.  Would recommend this and the others in the series to anyone interested in that type of painting.",1386374400,,181,4.65625

8442158,4,B004USTAG8,"Stephen Cronin has an easy, fast and very effective style of panting watercolours. He uses a limited palette and his results are astounding. He tends to mumble and this may be hard for non native English speakers. My American students find him hard to understand first time round. I would have liked him to show us more how he mixes the colours on his palette while he's actually doing it, how he dries his brush on the paper or cloth. He talks throughout the lesson, but it seems that he's addressing the canvas rather than his audience - hence the mumbling. I love his quick and easy style and I've learned a lot by watching him, but more explanations up front before the painting starts or the type of paper he uses, why he chooses not to stretch the paper before hand and how he avoids buckling with so much water, would be helpful. So please more of him, but also more explanations and teaching.",1328918400,2,900,4.460606060606061
8442159,5,B004USTAG8,"Catching Mr. Cornin doing his magic on YouTube, I knew I had to purchase his DVD. The moment the DVD started it's just not the same as watching his videos on YouTube. The features on the DVD such as Zoom, Slow Motion, and  Stop Action lend important tools for following Mr. Cronin's brushstrokes. Each time I view the DVD I learn something new. I would suggest perusing all six watercolour paintings at first. The magic is all in the brushstrokes.  It's easy to understand, and listening to the voice-over by this Englishman is a pure delight. In my opinion, the DVD has something to offer not only to the beginning watercolorist, but to the intermediate painter, and expert artisan as well. I rate this DVD 5 out of five stars.",1303084800,6,728,4.592307692307692
