1172960,4,9089707131,This is a very nice DVD although it's not what I thought it would be because this is my first  experience with this type of DVD so I didn't know what to expect of it. I probably will buy night walk also since I am a night person.,1426377600,,229,3.7708333333333335
1172961,4,9089707131,"I purchased this Virtual Walk DVD to use while running on the treadmill.

It has three separate walks with each walk repeating a particular loop. During the walks scenes change often using a ""turning page"" method that helps keep things a bit more interesting. The scenery is lovely and the pace of the walks works for walkers, runners and casual/slow cycling. The DVD does not play background music so I was able to just use my IPod if I wanted music.

I would recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a change of pace while on the treadmill. It will probably begin to bore if watched too often but its a nice way to spend some time on the treadmill.",1424822400,3,649,4.4
1172962,4,9089707131,"I normally get walking videos of nature trails. I thought I would try something new. The first while pretty was, just didn't do anything for me the second one was much better if not the nature I'm use to. To be honest I haven't done the third, but it looks to be like the second. I haven't done the third because I thought each walk would stop and I would start the next one. I started with Number 1 and after awhile thought this is stupid, they just keep showing the something over and over. I checked the time and I was 41 min into a 20 min walk. Yes it kept showing the same thing over and over I was on my 3rd time around. I remembered where the second one started and stopped when it started to repeat.",1398124800,,707,4.057142857142857
7901533,3,9089707131,"Not as good as the virtual nature walks from the Ambient Collection.  I much prefer the DVDs with the solitude of dirt trails and open skies or rustic trails and lots of foliage, or aquariums.  Too much footage of blacktop and other sidewalks and not enough foliage and flowers to satisfy me.",1489449600,,292,4.596153846153846
7901534,3,9089707131,"The park just isn't that interesting, but I do like that it's something I would do if I were there.  I just saved a ton in airfare and am in better shape to boot.",1480118400,,162,3.764705882352941

7901538,5,9089707131,"I have seen many Virtual Walks DVDs of Singapore, which are all very well done, this one is something special again. Here you can walk through the famous park ""Gardens by the Bay"" and admire the exceptional ""super trees"". Often you can go through the park and along the water, encountered by other walkers and you can discover the unique hotel ""Marina Bay Sands"". Video 2 goes through another park with lush green vegetation, here everything is quiet and very relaxing. Video 3 shows a walk that ends at dusk. You can also see the big wheel ""Singapore Flyer"" in the background. The scenery and the colors on this DVD are very nice to look at. With this DVD you can perfectly exercise in the nature, but there is also a lot of variety by the impressive sights in the background. Once again a very brilliant DVD that is clearly one of my favorites.",1433635200,,846,4.5
7901539,5,9089707131,"I have about 20 different walking dvd's and I think this is my favorite one.  It is awesome.  I wish I could actually be there.  The only thing that would be nice is, if there was a pause every once-in-awhile to scan around, just like when you are out walking and looking at things.  Singapore is a really beautiful and clean place. I am amazed at the upkeep of these areas and parks.  You can't go wrong with this one.",1429228800,2,419,4.1875
