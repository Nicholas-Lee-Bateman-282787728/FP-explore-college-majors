I teach TV production and I thought I might be able to use this DVD as a visual aid in my video production classes. Unfortunately, the only thing the DVD is good for is to demonstrate how NOT to make TV. Don't focus the camera yourself, let the camera think for you. Her lighting is bad. She edited the DVD herself and you wouldn't want to learn her technique. The sound continuity is terrible! The typography reminds me of a bad church bulletin. Bless her for trying, but this video is suitable for home movies only.",1204156800,,622,4.464912280701754
8499398,5,B000FJDBCK,"If you have ever thought of making a movie, this dvd is a MUST HAVE.

It really does show you how to make a movie suitable to send to a television station for public viewing, in 44 minutes....  Or for that matter take a home movie and make a professional looking movie, that won't bore your family to death having to watch it.

You could even use what you learn in less than one hour to make your own TV advertisement, saving you thousands of dollars.

This movie is very well presented, and I simply can't recommend it enough",1151884800,,526,4.282828282828283
8499399,5,B000FJDBCK,I found this DVD extremely helpful and cannot wait to begin my own TV program.  I would recommend it to anyone that has aspired to professional TV commercials or documentaries.,1151884800,,176,4.866666666666666
