8481194,2,B005OCY50U,"I agree with the two previous reviews. The particular points they mentioned, that jumped out at me as I watched the DVD:

1. The negativity about Glocks"" from the get-go.
2. The lack of research,"" and brevity of the so called, history section (actually since the instructor knew so little about the history of Glocks, its probably best that it was so brief).
3. The use of non-Glock parts in the cleaning section. Really?! Sure, parts are parts, and cleaninganythingis basically the same, but for the sake of a clear, professional presentation, couldn't they have cleaned the actual parts?! They had them right there.
4. Ultimately, like Matt, glock hobbyist ,  I will not be looking to AGI any further.

But for me, the most troubling aspect of the presentation is how casually the instructor handles all of the guns. He doesn't verifying (at least on camera, for our sake) that the guns were unloaded. And he has a complete disregard for muzzle awareness and trigger finger placement.

Arguably, in spite of the poor presentation (and disregard for safety), the instructor knows more about firearms than I do. So I actually DID glean info that I did not know, particularly when he discusses how everything works. This is why, unlike the two previous reviews, I gave the DVD a 2 star rating. But if you already have this DVD or purchase it in spite of these reviews, you would do well to research other sources, especially before applying any dis-assembly & reassembly advice.

Lenny Magills Complete Glock DVD, although not perfect, is a much better investment. It's an up-to-date, clear, concise, and professionally produced DVD. And Lenny Magill is a very engaging instructor.

Safe handling, safe shooting!",1404000000,2,1711,4.944250871080139
8481195,1,B005OCY50U,"This guide is awful. From the start, it's horrible audio and video quality. There is even a disclaimer in the beginning telling you that this is extremely old, and instead of making a new video like they should have, they just moved the crappy VHS recording to DVD.

The host of the video should NOT be doing this kind of work at all. Like the other reviewer stated, he talks very negatively about Glocks, repeatedly saying how ugly they are and poking fun at the polymer parts. You can really tell that he did NO research at all before shooting this video, as he couldn't name the calibers Glocks come in. Seemed like they just grabbed a camera and starting shooting without a real plan. He runs in to multiple problems while showing parts of the gun. They should have at least had one run through before shooting. The host also has an extremely poor on camera appearance. I feel like a ""guide"" like this should have a professional host, who is easy to understand and doesn't twitch every couple seconds. Not to sound insensitive, but a host should be easy to understand and listen to.

Overall, I'd much rather spend 10 minutes at a gun store getting all this info. If you were to take the gun apart and put it back together with someone experienced, you'll get just as much useful information.",1369267200,8,1296,4.534188034188034
8481196,1,B005OCY50U,"There is a lot of information on the web when it comes to Glocks, your best bet is to visit youtube or head to the forums. In this video, referred to as an armorer's course, you will get very basic information. I believe the manual that comes with your new pistol is more informative. The instructor is very oldschool, and opinionated about Glocks, actually a tad bit negative. This is not what you really want to hear after dropping $600+ on a new pistol. The cleaning section is an absolute disaster, they use 3 different gun components that are non-related to Glocks period. The ""Instructor"", shows you the most destructive way possible to disassemble the Glock magazine which just highlights his ignorance about Glocks. I originally bought this video to see what kind of information AGI had on modern firearms, hoping it might be a good outlet for hobby gunsmithing. IMO this is a complete fail, I will not be looking to AGI any further. There are plenty of other resources available at a much lower cost, shop around and do your homework before settling on any one thing if you have to make a purchase.

PS. I sent a similar note to AGI in regards to this video...they have not responded...I don't think I can blame them!

Good luck and safe shooting!
