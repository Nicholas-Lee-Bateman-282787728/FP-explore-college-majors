8325012,5,B000CSH0CG,This movie is good and is hardcore. Dorian trains  like none other. Glad they left it in black and white because it didn't take away from the videos origionality. My husband watches this quite often and says it is a great training video to see.,1432252800,2,244,4.4222222222222225
8325013,5,B000CSH0CG,"I followed Dorian's advice for a year, and gained 15lbs of muscle. My arms went from 11"" to 14"". For a genetically slim build at 5ft 11"" the results were very satisfying. especially at age 71. Slow and easy is the way to go for most people. You can't be in a hurry. Dorian Yate's book & video ""Blood and Guts"" is the bodybuilding instructions most people should follow.",1317254400,3,369,4.36231884057971
8325014,5,B000CSH0CG,"This video which is also available on DVD is a classic. Any one can learn a lot from the intensity demonstrated by Yates, its very inspiring. I got it back in the late 90's and its still a favorite. Save time in the gym,learn to up the intensity and reduce workout volume. I recommend it.",1229126400,3,288,4.254545454545455
