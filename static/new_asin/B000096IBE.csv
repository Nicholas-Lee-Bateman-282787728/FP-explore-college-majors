1880060,5,B000096IBE,"Way back in the day, when Cinemascope, aka widescreen projection first debuted, studios went searching for suitably epic subjects to show off this new medium. One of the first choices was the story of King Arthur. And this little beauty doesn't disappoint. Like ""Excalibur"" years later, the screenplay was adapted from ""Le Morte Darthur"", but with more emphasis on story and character rather than the fight scenes (which are still pretty intense by 1950's standards) and the production values are through the roof, with hundreds of extras for the battle and tournament scenes. Robert Taylor delivers a bravura performance as Sir Lancelot, equally intense and brooding, but also passionate and noble to a fault. (he was born for this role, no doubt) No video library is complete without ""Knights of the Round Table"". If you're looking for the ultimate period piece, or just enjoy swords and armor, look no further.",1477180800,,913,5.093333333333334

1880089,4,B000096IBE,"While ""Excalibur"" remains the single best Arthurian film that I've seen, ""Knights of the Round Table"" has its own charms when taken in proper context. Made in the early 1950s, it's a wonderful example of that era's spectacles, drenched in Technicolor & just a bit stodgy in being presented almost as pageant rather than film. In a way, it's the cinematic equivalent  of an old-fashioned book for mid-century boys, complete with lavish, full-color plates & stiffly archaic language, with  most of the graphic & morally troubling material pared away for family consumption.

That said, what we have is a thoroughly enjoyable film on its own terms. Little things I especially like: the formidable Green Knight is a somewhat pudgy, balding man under his armor; Merlin isn't a magician but rather a wise & cunning advisor, not above using allies as chess pieces; Morgan Le Fay is an icy beauty with a mind like a steel trap; and her paramour Modred, while not Arthur's son in this version, is played with energy & villainous gusto by young Stanley Baker.

As for the stars: Ava Gardner is a gorgeous Guinevere, although her character isn't given quite enough to do; Mel Ferrer looks leonine as Arthur, but is often in the background -- as he was in the original tales -- a somewhat static character until the final battle; and Lancelot is the world's best knight precisely because he's driven by his own self-perceived faults. His moody, melancholic portrayal is unusual, but it really grows on the viewer -- at least it did for this viewer.

The background details are also a delight: the handheld bellows for use with fire arrows; the art of falconry; the painted Picts. It's a bit of a jumble historically, with material spanning several centuries, but that's part of the appeal. The film also works in the Grail legend to good effect, with that tone of 1950s film piety that could be very good when used sparingly, as it is here. And the film doesn't stint on the religious devotion of the characters, in keeping with the courtly version of the tale from the end of the Middle Ages & the beginnings of the Renaissance. While the essentially pagan ""Excalibur"" has more visceral mythic power, it's interesting to see the material portrayed in this genteel fashion. Again, it's all very much in the tradition of boy's own adventure, and fun for that very reason.

So -- for the serious Arthurian, certainly a lesser film. But for a trip back to Saturday afternoon childhood wonder, you could do a lot worse. Recommended!",1452384000,,2516,4.799076212471132

1880104,4,B000096IBE,"The movie stinks... not just in a small way, but in a very big way. I mean it's terrible; made worse by the fact that Robert Taylor became a turncoat and stabbed many actors in the back during the Communist Scare in the early 1950's; also known as the McCarthy Era.

So why - you may ask - did I give the DVD four stars? Because buried on the back, and not mentioned in the review, is included the Academy Award Winning short made by the MGM orchestra under the direction of Jonny Green ""The Merry Wives of Windsor Overture."" Years ago, people used to admire ""classical"" music. This movie short showcases Green's great talent for conducting and the soundtrack is wonderful in one of the first ""Stereo"" movies ever made.

I felt like movies like ""Excalibur"" went a little off the rails as far as the story was concerned.  This was great, because it showed the Lancelot's betrayal with a simple kiss, instead of sex in the woods.  The point was made just as plainly.  For a 10 year-old, and for myself, although the movie-making effects are dated, the story-telling works, and if anything shows the complexity of the relationship with the king and his favorite knight even better.",1440547200,,543,4.625

Even though the story of Camelot has been remade umpteen times and is still going strong, this version of it is absolutely worth your time. A lot of attention to detail produced a splendid movie. Robert Taylor and Ava Gardner were at their peak in popularity and as Lancelot, Taylor was playing a part he could have phoned in. He was born to play Lancelot! He gave a well done and restrained performance. Ava Gardner was playing a part as far from her usual roles as she ever got but she was actually quite good in a restrained performance that worked. Mel Ferrer, Gabriel Woolf, and Maureen Swanson are superb in their supporting roles. This film has some villains that keep things on the edge. The special effects are good for the fifties. It is wholesome for the family except for some battle scenes. There are many wonderful spiritual moments that give it an uplifting quality. The values shown of honor, loyalty, and devotion make it a grand product of a time gone by. A era that is so nice to visit from time to time! (And keep visiting)",1436313600,,1086,4.5126903553299496

1880129,4,B000096IBE,"This is one of those big Hollywood productions that taken in pieces really is not all that good. The plot line is a silly play on good versus evil. The acting is often expressionless and wooden.

But for some reason, on the whole I liked it. Lots of knights fighting each other with swords and lances, and as was common for the period this movie was made, very little if anything in the way of blood and gore, considering all the people being stabbed and arrowed and lanced.

It has horses and cavalry charges, and neat costumes. Lots of swords and cool armor too.

Not much in the way of a plot, but more or less based on the King Arthur legends of the 6th century England.

If you like the genre, it will probably appeal to you.

Some people may be put off by the frequent reference to religion that seems to have been tacked on for no real reason.",1425254400,,850,4.254658385093168

1880195,5,B000096IBE,"Robert Taylor. I would not exactly call him MGM's version of Errol Flynn, but close. In actuality, Steward Granger is more in that mold. Taylor not only brings class, but a ruggedness to these kinds of swashbuckler roles, that Errol Flynn lacks. ""Knights"" which is in my opinon, a better film than 1952's ""Ivanhoe."" Where ""Ivanhoe"" drags, in certain parts of the film,""Knights"" however, keeps the viewer interested with it's wonderfully written plot. The film being MGM's first CinemaScope feature, is absolutely breathtaking. Unlike films of today, the1950's CinemaScope films are a treat to watch on today's big widescreen TV's I truly suggest  55inches and up. After watching ""Ivanhoe,"" ""Prince Valiant"" This one is definately best out of the three.",1363046400,,752,5.266666666666667
1880196,5,B000096IBE,"My all time favorite version is 1970's ""Excalibur"", but this version has the epic look and color of those beautiful older films. If you are a fan of the Arthorian myth's or just a fan of sword & scorcery/sandal/armor movies this is a must have. Another favorite of mine is the movie ""King Arthur"" with Clive Owen it is a historical speculation of the real Arthur. But if your looking for a great version of the King Arthur story "" Knights of the round table"" has it all and is definatley worth the purchase. What surprised me coming out of the 50's the sword fights are more accurate than the average choriography of that period which was generaly olympic style fencing but in this movie the swordplay is much more realistic useing halfswording techniques & grabbing the blade and strikeing with the hilt, kicks and shoulder shoves I was pleasantly surprised. This is a much more family friendly version of the classic tale than the grittier ""Excalibur"" and a great introduction for younger viewers,thats not to say that adults wouldn't love it , it was just made in a time when movies relied on story instead of foul language and sex for filler. ""Knights of the round table"" is certainly in my top 3 versions of the King Arthur movies.",1358812800,,1236,4.622727272727273

The pageantry is typically '50s Hollywood and, while some of the dialogue and plotlines may be thin, it's still a treat to watch and not get a headache from jumpy camera shots and rapid-fire dialogue that wreck so many of today's movies.

1880233,2,B000096IBE,"MGM's followup to their hugely successful Ivanhoe and the studio's first film in CinemaScope, Knights of the Round Table is one of those pictures where all the money the studio system can throw at it can't disguise its shortcomings. Chief among them is an ambling and unfocused screenplay that takes ample liberties with the legend. With so many different versions of the tales of King Arthur to choose from, that's excusable, but coming up with something that's so poor to replace it isn't. It works in fits and starts despite direlogue like ""I've blustered my last bluster"" and the less than perfect casting - Ava Gardner's fine as Guinevere and Stanley Baker scowls well as Mordred but Mel Ferrer's makes a bland Arthur and Taylor overdoes Lancelot's enthusiasm - but it never really manages to catch fire. The fight scenes seem desperately under-rehearsed and lazily staged and even the film's big battle scene seems a more expensive but less effective rehash of Olivier's Agincourt sequence from Henry V. Nor does CinemaScope add much to the proceedings, the opening scene a demonstration of early Scope at its worst, with the cast spaced out in what seems intended as a medieval tableau but just looks like a police line-up at a renaissance fair in long takes that could have benefited from some editing and cutaways to at least give the illusion of pace and energy. Only Miklos Rozsa rallies to the film's banner with a stirring score that summons up the pageantry and grandeur the images all too often fail to. Still, the team did at least redeem themselves with the subsequent Quentin Durward.

While the German fullframe PAL release is especially poor and to be avoided at all costs, the US Region 1 NTSC DVD offers a 2.55:1 widescreen transfer that's not one of WHV's best (the laserdisc release from MGM/UA was much better) but compensates with a fine array of extras: introduction by Mel Ferrer, newsreel footage of the premiere, Scope musical short Overture to The Merry Wives of Windsor, production notes, the original theatrical trailer and trailers for Camelot and Excalibur.",1293580800,,2092,4.943181818181818

This is a very old movie, which is one of the reasons I purchased it, knowing that I would not have to worry about inappropriate language or scenes.  (Why can't they still make interesting movies whereby we are not assaulted by obscene language and the almost obligatory dirty sex scene?)

Unfortunately, Taylor is a comically wooden as he was in the earlier film.  Whenever the tone turns rueful, he's lost.  Mel Ferrer is along as King Arthur, and he's okay, if frankly a little creepy.

But oh, that Ava!  She's so smoldering and  beautiful she nearly burns a hole in the screen.  You cannot take your eyes of her, and she gives a performance that's confident and subtle, in an entirely different class than her two male co-stars.  She's completely sensational.

It feels like all the historical epics from this period included Felix Aylmer in the cast and he's Merlin and very good.  Young Stanley Baker plays the main villain and manages to make his speeches seem almost Shakespearean.  (Plus his eerie resemblance to Roger Federer was never plainer.)

There is some good action and a cool final duel, marred somewhat by a Lassie-style moment.  Also, um...the knights engage in a sporting pillow fight.

Sir Lancelot (matinee idol Robert Taylor), son of King Ban of Benwick (a small realm in Brittany), comes to England in search of King Arthur (Mel Ferrer), whose reputation has convinced him that he is the perfect liege-lord.  When the two encounter each other in the woods and anonymously duel to a standstill, their friendship is cemented forever.  But when Arthur sends for Guinevere (Ava Gardner), whom he has long loved, to become his queen, and Lancelot rescues her from the Green Knight (Niall MacGinnis) and finds himself struck by love as well, a serpent enters Eden.

The production designers wisely assumed, as did Malory himself, that Arthur, if he existed, presided not over a court of 6th-Century Celts, but over a country much like Malory's own in both technology and sociopolitical organization.  The script suggests that Lancelot and Guinevere never physically consummated their passion; indeed Lancelot is determined not to betray Arthur, and allows himself to be married off to Elaine (Maureen Swanson), sister of Percival (Gabriel Woolf), who loves him and whom he comes to genuinely care for, and sent up to the northern border country so temptation will be removed from both of them.  Merlin (Felix Aylmer) meets a fate unlike the traditional one familiar to most of us, and some viewers may wonder how Arthur's legitimate half-sister Morgan le Fay (Anne Crawford) can describe Mordred (Stanley Baker) as her heir, since no blood link between them (or between Arthur and Mordred) is ever mentioned.  There is, however, a real feel for chivalric tradition in the script, and several good action sequences ranging from single combats to full-scale battles, and like Errol Flynn's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKEZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Robin Hood (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, the film is so splendidly mounted that you can forget the inaccuracies and just enjoy it for its own sake.",1260748800,,2459,6.110144927536232

The dramatic high moment of the film is revealed when Lancelot and Guinevere are discovered together in Lancelot's chamber by Mordred's men... Passion's fire ignited within...

The film tries to present the pageantry and brilliance of the epoch like bloody combat scenes, ardent jousting tournaments, and a fierce fight to the death...

Yes, the acting is not very inspiring, Robert Taylor never did know how to act, but evidently was a pretty face at that point in time (I was born the year it came out.) But the Technicolor is gorgeous, and the story itself is a powerful one. If the movie makes anyone want to read the historical literature, then it is useful, as well as entertaining. My only gripe is that the disc itself seems to be flawed in its manufacture. I sent the first back and got a second, but it is the same flaw. The picture suddenly changes its dimensions as if it is about to ""go out"" and then suddenly straightens itself out. I've played both copies on multiple players, it is the same on each one.

It's good where it needs to be good:  the action, particularly the battle scenes; the scenery; the costumes and weaponry.  Moreover, the talk of honor is done seriously, and the Christian piety expressed is a very good thing (and a rare thing, too, in films these days).  One can talk around the business of adultery and talk about trust and promises and love on the one hand, and gossip and intrigue on the other.

1880271,2,B000096IBE,"Disappointing. That's the word that echoed through my head as I struggled through this abomination. I was trying to glean any salvageable moments from this film to show to my tenth-grade English class, but alas! I don't know anything really about the actors other than most of them can't act, especially the guy playing Lancelot. Lancelot is supposed to be passionate and lusty, whereas this John Wayne-soundalike looks as bored as Napoleon Dynamite in history class. It irritates me when Hollywood makes a film based on British subject matter and yet hires American actors who don't even attempt a British accent. What if it were the other way around? A film about Ronald Reagan starring Ian McKellan? There would be rioting in the streets.

The screenplay stays relatively close to Malory, and any liberties taken are forgiven since, after all, it's Arthur we're talking about. The Arthur universe is not immutable, and changes from writer to writer are expected. The only thing is, there's no magic. I'm not talking about magicians' magic. I'm talking about the magic of Camelot and Excalibur and knights and chivalry and Merlin and everything fantastical. There's no imagination or sparkle to this film.

However, the costumes and colors are, I must admit, striking, and in fact remind me of a much better representation of the British medieval period: The Adventures of Robin Hood, with Errol Flynn.",1114992000,,1404,5.073593073593074

You have to look at films from the early fifties without reference to what you get today.  Good special effects meant that he studio fans actually blew all of the costumes in the same directions.  The studio system was about to die.  Movies paid the bills with star's faces.  A 10 year old went to see the story, and this is a great story.  You can watch this movie.  It isn't history, or fantasy.  It is just a lot of fun from a time when you could set through it a second time for free if you called you mom and asked her not to come get you for two more hours.  Put this in your collection and you can watch it once a year and enjoy it.  And if you really want historical accuracy, this film is it.  It is just exactly what films were all about in 1954 before TV came along and shrunk everything into one syllable.",1105747200,,992,4.030769230769231
1880303,3,B000096IBE,"Normally, I am able suspend disbelief and really get into this type of movie, but ""Knights of the Round Table"" somewhat defeated me. If one listens carefully to the opening narrative, the end of the Roman occupation of Britain happened shortly before the High Middle Ages -- and looking at the costumes you can tell they weren't kidding! So putting any question of historical accuracy aside, what would recommend the movie?

First of all, the setting is lovely. The movie seems to have been made in England, or in a corner of a back lot that does a wonderful job of standing in for England. Robert Taylor's Lancelot is handsome, as is Mel Ferrer's King Arthur, while Ava Gardner is  beautiful, if slightly mature looking, as Arthur's legendary queen. Taylor, who did such an excellent job in so many movies, including ""Ivanhoe,"" is a little hammy in the role, while Ferrer is strangly passive as Arthur. Gardner probably gives the most natural performance of the lot.

However, to me the acting honors go to Taylor's beautiful horse, who has been trained to instantly respond to his master's voice. The horse is quickly able to figure out how to rescue Lancelot from quicksand, by flinging the reins out over the bog with uncanny head tosses until Taylor catches them and is dragged to safety. That is only matched by Taylor singlehandedly overturning a huge monolith at Stonehenge with the touch of his hand!

However, the movie is not total camp. Gardner's performance is touching, especially the final scene with Lancelot before the two are to go on trial for adultery. IMO she is a much better actress than she has been given credit, or than apparently she felt that she was --  which is a shame.  If you enjoy movies about this period of English history and legend (no matter when it actually took place) I would say it won't hurt to add it to your DVD library.",1105228800,,1866,4.691131498470948
1880304,4,B000096IBE,"KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE is a movie about the classic tale of King Arthur, Sir Lancelot and Guinevere. Lancelot's ill-fated love for Guinevere is played out against a background of cavalry charges, fierce battles and pageantry. The plot is amplified by the rivalry between Lancelot and Mordred as well as Sir Percival's quest for the Holy Grail. Merlin appears in the film as an advisor to Arthur and Lancelot's wife dies while giving birth to the future Sir Gallahad.
Robert Taylor as Lancelot and Mel Ferrer as Arthur are both superb. Ava Gardner makes a beautiful Guinevere but her acting seems to be a little flat. The strong supporting cast includes Stanley Blake, Felix Aylmer and Robert Urguhart.
KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE received Academy Award nominations for Best Color, Art Direction and Sound. The main competition for Oscars in 1953 came from STALAG 17, ROMAN HOLIDAY and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.

1880305,3,B000096IBE,"""Knights of the Round Table"" was MGM's first feature in the newly christened widescreen format of Cinemascope and the studio's inexperience with a 2:35:1 aspect ratio, in retrospect, is rather obvious.  The audience is treated to drawn out battle scenes (that are thrilling) and lavish spectacle.  But the whole look and feel of the film is very theatrical, like Shakespeare on stage.  Robert Taylor, usually so natural, is uncomfortably stiff as Lancelot, while Mel Ferrer fairs slightly better as King Arthur.  Ava Gardner is wasted as Gueneviere.  Sets and rear projection are glaringly obvious. Over all, for its historical context in the early days of widescreen film, more than entertainment value, ""Knights"" is a worthwhile movie.
Warner Home Video has given us a generally good looking print.  No attempt has been made to remove age related artifacts from the negative.  Overall, the quality of the transfer is very smooth though, at times, it can seem somewhat digitally harsh.  Exterior footage tends to suffer from a considerable amount of film grain while interiors are well balanced.  Black levels are perhaps a bit weak and fine details are lost in the darker scenes. Close ups look gorgeous.  Long shots suffer from pixelization. Fades between scenes tend to suffer from a sudden grainy quality that is customary for all Cinemascope film stock of this period.  The audio is stereo surround and amply provided for considering the limitations in the original recording.
EXTRAS: Mel Ferrer comments on the film's production.  There's a featurette movietone trailer and the film's original theatrical trailer too.
OVER ALL: Not a bad movie but an incredibly dated one, ""Knights of the Round Table"" nevertheless offers up a good example of vintage Cinemascope film making from the 1950's.",1057104000,,1798,5.204861111111111

1880309,3,B000096IBE,"With the cast this movie had, I would have expected a bit more life.  First bit of trouble is Robert Taylor.  Why the man rose to the star he did is amazing because he had all the range from A-B.  His performance is very monotone, but oddly enough everyone seems to try for that flat, non emotional level.  Maybe they think Brits talk like that???
The costumes are gorgeous, as is the radiant Ava.  But there is no fire in the leads and all seem to barely know their lines continually uttered with one tone indifference, let alone FEELING the part.  The passion is missing in the Lancelot-Guinevere-Arthur triangle, because of lack luster performances by all three, most especially Taylor.  He is a dead dull which really sinks the movie.  The only one really showing any spark of true swashbuckle was the late Sir Stanley Baker (Zulu) as Mordred (all connections to being Arthur's son sanitised from the script!!!).
If you just want a pleasingly dated look at a richly coloured costumer in MGM wide screen, this is nice watch. Great for Stanley Baker Fans or Ava Gardner addicts.  However, if you are true fan of the round table or good acting take a miss, for by the end you will be yawning......",1021939200,,1198,4.586854460093897
1880310,4,B000096IBE,"1953's KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE was MGM's first wide-screen motion picture (filmed in CinemaScope in England). What the film lacks in scripting is made up by spectacular and brilliant cinematography by Freddie Young, colorful art designs by Alfred Junge and Hans Peters and an exciting score composed by Miklos Rozsa (a prelude to his majestic EL CID score). Robert Taylor looks good as Sir Lancelot of the Lake. Mel Ferrer is King Arthur. Ava Gardner is Queen Guinevere. (Sir) Stanley Baker comes off best as Sir Modred who plots to undermine King Arthur. There are large-scale battles and much swordplay throughout the adventure. The sword fight between Sir Lancelot and King Arthur is well filmed and the most dramatic which sets the stage for the relationship between these two men. There is another sword fight later in the film between Sir Lancelot and Sir Modred's men. This is a well-staged and choreographed duel which takes place on the steps outside Lancelot's quarters in the castle. Despite all this swordplay the story is somewhat static and does not really evoke that much emotion from the viewer. However director Richard Thorpe is successful in conveying Guinevere's love, through a restrained but effective performance by Ava Gardner, for Sir Lancelot. Ultimately it is a solid film in the old Hollywood traditions of storytelling.",1012780800,,1351,5.117647058823529

1880322,4,B000096IBE,"Richard Thorpe's take on the Arthurian legend is a fun and sometimes even poignant retelling of this undying myth.  Though this is a fine all-around movie, the production values are what jump out at you:  from the heraldry and splendid arms and armor of the knights to the castles, courts, countrysides and ladies they war with one another for, the whole picture is a virtual feast to the eye.  The various battle scenes, divided into several large-scale melees and invididual duels, are excellently choreographed and suspenseful.  Compared to the lavish costumes, sets, and battles, the acting itself does come in second, despite a tremendous cast.  Still, Robert Taylor and Mel Ferrer essay their roles of Lancelot and King Arthur with zest and apparent respect for the icons they represent, and Anne Crawford is a wonderfully beautiful but deadly (though non-magical) Morgan le Fay.  Ava Gardner makes a believably tormented--and particularly lovely-- Guinevere, but doesn't get enough screen time.  Merlin, too, is underdeveloped, and his exact role (teacher? wizard?  doting foster-father?) goes unexplained.
The basic plot of ""Knights of the Round table"" is built around the familiar Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle, but Thorpe invests his picture with an identity and vibrant life all its own.  Colorful, lively, and thrilling, ""Knights of the Round Table"" is a flawed but still-wonderful delight.",998524800,,1412,5.440366972477064
1880323,4,B000096IBE,"Rule one of King Arthur stories: there is no ""definitive"" version. Every writer or filmaker adjusts the story to serve their audience and/or the point they are trying to make. That being said, this version was  created to serve the Hollywood epic audience to tell a tragic story of love  and war in the middle ages, and it does that job.
The story here follows  Arthur gaining the throne and his friendship with Lancelot, both of which  are threatened by Lancelot's love for the Queen, Guenevere, and the  ambitions of Morgan, Arthur's half-sister, and her champion, Mordred. The  film is filled with the kind of spectacle you would expect form a  miod-'50's Cinemascope epic. There are battles, jousts, swordfights in  woods, fields, castle steps, court pageantry, heraldry, court dancing,  challenges, court intrigue, and a passionate kiss or two. Merlin is there,  but there is no ""magic"" to speak of. He is there mostly as an  advisor to Arthur.
The acting is rather stilted. Robert Taylor has about  two expressions, mouth open and mouth closed. Niall MacGinnis is at his  stoic worst. Mel Ferrer keeps a straight face and does express some of the  sadness of the king's position. The women (Ava Gardner as Guenevere, Anne  Crawford as Morgan) get to emote, Crawford especially playing off Stanley  Baker as a sinister plotter.
The use of heraldry is very effective. The  designs are mostly of period style, and allow the viewer to tell who is  who. The armor shows some very good work, marred only occasionally by  non-period details. The swordfights, though falliing into the typical  Hollywood style of holding the shield behind, taking big wind-up swings,  and stabbing the armpit, is done with verve and energy. One battle scene is  a direct swipe of Olivier's Henry V, only more exciting. The cosumes are  almost completely the product of the designers imagination, only somewhat  inspired by period styles.
This was MGM's first Cinemascope movie, and it  shows. I have seen it both in pan-and-scan and in a Widescreen DVD. In  p&s, the cinematography looks downright boring and uninspired. In  widescreen, you realize that each shot was carefully composed to make  maximum use of the whole screen. The action on screen is still a little  stiff, but the picture is beautiful and, in some instances, powerful.  Unfortunately, I don't know of any widescreen editition in the USA.
The  differences in the plot of this movie and ""Le Morte D'Arthur,""  which is credited as the source material, could fill a book, and the period  style of the costume, armor, and production design fits more the period in  which it was written (1400's) than in which it is set (post-Roman  Brittain). The script is corny, but if you can get into it, that's part of  the fun. This movie is worth seeing at least once, being generous towards  the Hollywood sensibilities under which it was made.",963619200,,2881,4.914760914760914
