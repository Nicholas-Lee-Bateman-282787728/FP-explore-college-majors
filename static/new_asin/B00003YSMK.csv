7919546,5,B00003YSMK,"Cartoons were just one weapon in the USSR's ideological arsenal of propaganda. Divided by topic, these cartoons were meant to extol the benefits of communism while belittling the non-communists and doing what good propaganda does: objectifying them and making it OK to want to hate and kill Americans and other ""fascists."" The style was definitely different, although in some later cartoons it seems as if you can see elements of Yellow Submarine.

The best part of the disc set is the short ""documentaries"" which are on each disc and which cartoonists and others from the Soviet era explain how propaganda was regulated by the Party, as well as the background on some of these films and what life was like in the USSR. A great history lesson!",1397433600,,743,4.850393700787402
7919547,5,B00003YSMK,"This is fascinating collection of animated short films from the former USSR. Broadly describable as propaganda, the films span three periods. The first is from 1917 to 1941 representing attempts to mobilise people to build the new socialist society. The second period spans the war and its aftermath - and the films are aimed at boosting morale and encouraging people to fight the German invaders. The third period covers the post-War era until 1989 when the object was to convince Soviet citizens of the superiority of their system over that of the West - and of the threat they faced from USA and its allies.

The films are reproduced on four discs. The first titled ""American Imperialists"" tries to show the malevolence of the capitalist enemy. ""Mr Twister"" is a tale of an American industrialist who takes a vacation with his family in the USSR. He refuses to stay in the hotel he has booked because on arrival he realises that there are non-White guests with who he must share the hotel. His Soviet hosts however in the end compel him to accept the company of the guests after a series of pranks and misadventures they engineer and subject the Americans to. The American bigots, in the end, are shown a better alternative in ""socialist humanism"".  Highlighting racial prejudice of the enemy was a common theme of Soviet propaganda - in contrast to the supposed welcome offered by the USSR to all. It is perhaps ironic that the Americans in the end elected a black President (twice) and it is Russia that has acquired a reputation for unfriendliness to dark skinned foreigners.

However, propaganda in the end to work must combine some fact with message - to try to sell the ideology being promoted. The ""Shooting Range"" addresses the entrenched unemployment that has dogged the US since the 70s, where the only job a young man in New York can find, is as a live target at a shooting range.  Although bitter hyperbole, the film deals with a problem that was and is real enough. ""Ave Maria"" is a poignant series of images dealing with atrocities of the Vietnam War to the music of Schubert's ""Ave Maria"". ""The Millionaire"" is the story of a dog which inherits its owner's fortune and ends up in the image of a brutal capitalist whom everyone kow tows to and the dog gets himself elected to the Senate on the back of public acclaim. Ridicule of the enemy was also a theme of the propaganda.

The second disc titled ""Fascist Barbarians"" and is a series of cartoons showing the German invaders in a true enough light - and the ultimate triumph of the Red Army. The final films deals with the post-War era and a fear of a revived Germany attacking the USSR again - with Western backing, an underlying fear of the Russians during the 50s. Many of the films are moving - showing the true enough heroism of the Russians in defeating the enemy, such as the Young Pioneers who take on German tanks.

The third disc ""Capitalist Sharks"" aims to convince Russians of the badness of capitalism. A 1920s cartoon is set on Mars where oppressed and badly treated workers are rescued from their situation by Space-Bolsheviks who arrive in a spaceship from the USSR and lead a revolution. The cartoon reflects an early engagement by film makers in the USSR with the sci-fi genre. ""The Shareholder"" describes the life of worker in a capitalist country who is issued a share in the enterprise he works for and fooled into believing that he really is a stakeholder. In the end, he is left in destitution as the real owners, namely finance capital, automates his job and enriches itself, leaving the employees with nothing - a sharp reminder from an earlier era of very contemporary problems.

The last disc extols the virtues of Communism including a film promoting electrification and collectivisation of agriculture from the 20s and 30s. An animation from the 70' inspired by the poetry of Mayakovsky, showcases the industrial achievements of the USSR.

The artistic merit and technical quality of the films is excellent - even if as propaganda, some of the films in light of later knowledge of some of the terrible costs of the Soviet experiment appear less than convincing. The output of the 20s in particular is outstanding - a time of great artistic freedom in the USSR when artists experimented widely in styles and techniques before the Stalin era. Later styles reflect Western influence, for example the Disney like cartoons of the 50s - albeit in the service of Zhdanov rather that Hollywood. The cartoons from the 70s have a touch of Woodstock and psychedelia. In some cases, the cartoons reflect Russian styles including folk art.

Interestingly, these cartoons were for domestic consumption and not known outside the USSR - at least until after the end of the USSR. Perhaps for good reason. Viewers in Western countries may have been less convinced by the depictions of their own societies than people in the USSR without knowledge of the outside world, even though some aspects of the critique of capitalism are uncomfortably close to the bone - and resonate today against the backdrop of the economic crisis that set in after 2008.",1357257600,5,5128,4.778781038374718
7919548,1,B00003YSMK,"I satisfied my curiosity by viewing Disc 1, and can see why this series might be of major interest to historians or those wanting to learn more about the Cold War. On the other hand. The Soviets were not very good cartoonists, and their propaganda is so sterotyped and heavy handed as to be a complete turnoff. As a result, this compilation is apt to be a large bore to contemporary viewers. On the other hand, Russian citizens in the mid-twentieth century may have been more receptive.

In my memory,  American propaganda in the visual arts never portrayed the Soviets in such a crude, unsophisticated fashion.  The German Nazis, however, protrayed them in cartoons as bestial and rapacious barbarians",1248307200,2,702,4.882352941176471
7919549,2,B00003YSMK,"This is a fascinating collection of really beautiful animated films.

Unfortunately, they are marred by some very obtrusive English subtitles, which CAN'T BE SWITCHED OFF, they are rendered into the video stream.

This is deeply upsetting, because the value of the films is in their visual impact, not their text, and the ugly subtitles are ALL OVER the frame.",1246579200,22,360,5.084745762711864

7919551,4,B00003YSMK,"This four-DVD release gathers together what may be some of the most ideologically garish cartoons of the 20th century. And yet, if you look past that and revel in the method and artistry of these animators, artists and directors, you will be amazed. In fact, these films often display rather daring artistic expression for their times - apparently permissible if the anti-Americanism was sufficiently rabid.
