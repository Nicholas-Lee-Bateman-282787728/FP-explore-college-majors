1636281,4,B00005NNSQ,"I'm not a Lewis Grizzard fan, but I bought this for my dad. He really enjoys it. Probably most appropriate for adults in their late 40's to late 50's.",1379203200,,150,4.206896551724138
1636282,5,B00005NNSQ,"What a delight to listen to Lewis. I followed his career when he was alive and miss his unique perspective on life.

Buy and enjoy anything by him.",1371945600,3,147,4.25

1636284,3,B00005NNSQ,"Lewis Grizzard is funny as hell, especially for those who've ever been south of the Mason-Dixon line. For those who haven't, you might need to find a translator...",1363478400,2,163,4.857142857142857
1636285,5,B00005NNSQ,Lewis Grizzard has been gone now for almost 20 years. His legacy lives on in this video. Apparently it was the only video ever made of him and I am so glad to have it. I have always loved his books and enjoyed his unique sense of southern humor.,1346630400,,245,4.020408163265306
1636286,5,B00005NNSQ,"A life-long Lewis Grizzard fan, I mourn the loss of his talent in 1994. This DVD is typical Lewis: his Newnan, Georgia accent, his collegiate football recollections, as well as the stories about his ex-wives and his pig valve. Though not as edgy today as it seemed back in the '90's, I throughly enjoyed ""An Evening with Lewis Grizzard"". His comedy, though on-the-edge about many subjects, is nowhere near the shock value of today's comics; vintage and priceless.",1311897600,3,463,4.948717948717949
1636287,5,B00005NNSQ,"Lewis is a master story teller, in the Myron Cohen league.  His untimely death cut short what would have been that of a truly great entertainer.  His many CD's confirm his potential.  This one and only video of his performance is to be treasured. The stories he relates concerning his health are true. ECL",1195862400,6,305,4.611111111111111
1636288,5,B00005NNSQ,This video contains some of the best material covered by Lewis Grizzard in his short-but-memorable career!,1185753600,2,106,5.6875
1636289,5,B00005NNSQ,"I highly recommend this DVD for any fan of Lewis. Although not very long, it is a great way to see him. It is apparently the only  video of him performing and he doesn't disappoint. It makes you want to read some of his books all over again. It also reminds us a lot of what Jeff Foxworthy does now - another great Southern comedian!",1168819200,10,333,4.123076923076923
