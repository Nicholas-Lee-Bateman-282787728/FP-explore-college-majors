3986621,5,B002TY78PU,"I have followed these Wimsey productions from VHS to DVD and now to this collection. This one is the best so far with far less grain and fuzziness than I have seen on other productions. One problem I have run into is that the sound will not play on my Sony blu-ray player.

It may be amusing but it is full fledged whodunit. The clues are all laid out for the reader so you know everything Lord Peter has to work with in solving the mystery. That way you can try to solve it yourself.
This is also a good 'period' piece as it was written in the 1920's and depicts the UK during that period. When depicting events in the past we are looking at another world and another culture. The book does a good job of doing that for us.",1274659200,,548,4.228571428571429

3986624,4,B002TY78PU,"About ten years ago, I purchased a DVD release of the Ian Carmichael run for Wimsey, and although I loved the series (sorry, I'm in the Petherbridge camp as far as accuracy of portrayal; Petherbridge succeeded in being three-dimensional, witty, and a lot more believable; Carmichael was essentially playing an overaged Bertie Wooster), I hated the fact that hard-of-hearing little me couldn't make out the dialog, and they weren't even closed-captioned!  I was really looking forward to the re-release of the series, but since the Carmichael run still doesn't include subtitles, I think I'll pass.  And I already have the Petherbridge run, which does have subtitles, so I'm happy.  So ... five stars for the production (even though miscast, Ian Carmichael was very engaging and amusing as the noble detective) and two stars for re-releasing it on the cheap, with no additions or improvements.  Fie.",1271808000,6,898,5.172413793103448
3986625,5,B002TY78PU,"I approached this set with some trepidation knowing the age of the recordings. After the few shaky opening minutes (an outside shot with poor color & definition)the series settled done to pure delight. I recommend this to any Poirot fan as being fully up to standard.

A lot has been made of Carmichael's age compared with the fictional Wimsey. The actor even mentions it himself in a recorded interviewer. However that's total rot. I was never conscious of Wimsey's age while reading the stories and I wasn't in the least bit conscious of Carmichaels age. He played the part very well. I agree the Wimsey nerves and self doubts were underplayed but at least they were not totally absent as with the Petherbridge interpretation that made Wimsey a humorless and rather pompous ass. Why did he need to keep slapping down Bunter in such an acid manner?

To me, the key Wimsey attribute was his effortless charm & wit that enabled him to be the most pleasant companion to everyone regardless of social standing. I defy anyone to tell me that Petherbridge's Wimsey would be in much demand as a dinner guest. Carmichael would be top of most people's lists.

Anyway, I digress. This is a very good set, well written and brilliantly acted by all the cast. And true to the books.",1271289600,27,1270,4.686098654708521
3986626,4,B002TY78PU,"I write this knowing that I seem to be in the minority.  That is, I'm one of those people who LOVE the Edward Petherbridge version of Lord Peter Wimsey, and LIKE the Ian Carmichael version.  I have both full sets on DVD and have viewed them with pleasure many times.

This version, with Ian Carmichael, is pleasant, but his Wimsey doesn't have the depth of Peterbridge's version.  If you've read the Wimsey mysteries (and I have them all), you know that there's a lot of angst rattling around in Wimsey's brain, which his outward flippancy belies.  Ian Carmichael plays Wimsey as almost stolid, which all ""good"" British gentlemen of the period were expected to be, just look at Peter's brother, the Duke.  The whole point of Lord Peter, however, is that he has flashes of very un-stolidness.

I will admit that Petherbridge's Wimsey is a bit more melodramatic and ""romantic"".  But I like it that way. Plus, Edward very much more looks the part of the Wimsey in the books.

That said, this version with Ian Carmichael is good solid fun, and there's a lot more stories than you can get starring Petherbridge (he made only 3), so, as I say, I guess I'm in the minority!

3986627,5,B002TY78PU,"Dorothy L. Sayers writes many non-fiction books however among her best fiction is the Lord Peter Wimsey series. I came to this series somewhat though the back door. My first taste was the BBC productions with Petherbridge as Lord Peter that can now be found on DVD. Therefore, I read all of Dorothy's books containing the relationship of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Now it is time to go through the whole series.

Now I watch the one I missed in PBS. The first thing I notices was that Ian Carmichael talks much faster than Petherbridge. Moreover, all the people seem older. Of course, Peter was supposed to be older when he met Harriet.

Clouds of Witness

Lord Peter returns from Corsica. To find his older brother the Duke of Denver (David Langton) practically accused of murder. What is worse is his brother is not talking. Therefore, it is up to Peter to find out what happened and clear his brother.

In the process, he puts his foot in it and practically gets all his relatives and friends accused. As with all Sayers' stories nothing is simple there are overlapping plots and foolish deeds, as if Peter cannot figure them out. On the side, we learn a little about English society and ballistics.

They took the time to put just about everything relevant from the book in to this production. There were a few exceptions but not worth bothering about. The production is complete enough that you do not have to read the book.

The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club

""Waiter take away Lord what's-his name""

""He's been dead for two days...""

We are introduced to the Bellona club were young Captain George Fentiman (John Quentin) and Lord Peter Wimsey (Ian Carmichael) two war survivors are talking a little too loud about General Fentiman (Ralph Truman), Georges grandfather. General Fentiman is not responding and for good reason he is dead. Upon further investigation, we find that the general's sister Lady Dormer has also died the very same day. Poor George will only inherit 2000 pounds. However, who gets the lion's share of the estate all hinges on who died first. Lord peter as a friend and a snoopy armature sleuth must ascertain the answer and if there is foul play the perpetrator. In any case, this is a most unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.

I think sometime these programs are made for those that have already read the book because you cannot put everything from the book into the series the highlights and major information is all there but some of the how they got to the information is missing in obvious gaps. Still the essence is captures quite well.",1263945600,6,2647,4.836283185840708
3986628,4,B002TY78PU,"As a long-time Wimsey devotee [my first dog was named Wimsey, the vet's office never got it right] I confess to being of two minds about the two different portrayals of Lord Peter that are available on DVD.  This set, with Ian Carmichael, I think has the better choice of actors for the character as written.  Ian Carmichael does a better job of getting the casual elegance, the verbal dexterity, the airy persiflage.  I also think that Glyn Houson is the better Bunter, and particularly in the back story of Lord Peter and Bunter during WWI.  Richard Morant, who plays Bunter to Edward Petherbridge's Lord Peter in the Harriet Vane DVD trilogy, is too young in relation to Petherbridge to have believably been a sergeant in WWI.

However -- that's the crux of the problem in both series -- the age of the actors.  The Lord Peter stories take place in the 1920s - 1930s; Lord Peter is said to have been born in 1890.  So, for example, in the opening sequence of the Nine Tailors, Lord Peter was 25 and off to the war ; in the main part of the story, probably set in 1933-4, Wimsey should have been no more than mid-40s, and Ian Carmichael is clearly too long in the tooth for the part.  The same thing can be said with even more vigor about Clouds of Witnesses [Lord Peter's likely age: 34], The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club [38], Five Red Herrings [41], and Murder Must Advertise (my own personal favorite of all the Lord Peter books) [43].  Ian Carmichael does a really good job with the character, but there's no getting around the fact [for dyed in the wool fans] that he's 10 to 20 years too old for the part.  Against this, for anyone not so dyed in the wool, or who's coming to the series with a fresh eye, Carmichael is great and the shows are marvelous mysteries of the quintessential English unpleasantness among the upper classes type.  [The supporting parts are also well done -- the Dowager Duchess, Freddy Arbuthnot, MIss Climpson, Chief Inspector Parker.]

However -- there's that two minds thing again -- don't miss the Edward Petherbridge/Harriet Walter trilogy, either.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dorothy-L-Sayers-Mysteries-The-Lord-Peter-Wimsey-Harriet-Vane-Collection-Strong-Poison-Have-His-Carcass-Gaudy-Night/dp/B000062XDX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dorothy L. Sayers Mysteries (The Lord Peter Wimsey-Harriet Vane Collection - Strong Poison / Have His Carcass / Gaudy Night)</a>&nbsp;Petherbridge is a favorite of mine and was closer to the true age when the programs were done in 1987, but his portrayal, for me, lacks the underlying core of mischievousness in Lord Peter.  There is always in the Lord Peter of the books an element of the little boy who never quite grew up.  He could as easily be Lord Peter Pan as Lord Peter Wimsey!  For example, from the first paragraph of ""The Entertaining Episode of the Article in Question"", Sayers says of Lord Peter:  ""THe unprofessional detective career of Lord Peter Wimsey was regulated (though the word has no particular propriety in the connexion) by a persistent and undignified inquisitiveness.  The habit of asking silly questions -- natural, though irritating, in the immature male -- remained with him long after his immaculate man, Bunter, had become attached to his service to shave the bristles from his chin and see to the purchase and housing of Napoleon brandies and Villar y Villar cigars.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-Peter-The-Complete-Lord-Peter-Wimsey-Stories/dp/0060913800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord Peter : The Complete Lord Peter Wimsey Stories</a>&nbsp;Harriet Walter [niece of Christopher Lee] makes a marvelous Harriet Vane, and the interaction between them, even taking into account that Lord Peter is too serious, is really very good.  Of the three, Strong Poison has the best plot and the scenes between Lord Peter and Harriet in the prison visiting room are true perfection -- two splendid actors at the top of their game.  It's a shame that they didn't finish the story arc with Busman's Honeymoon.

Two last words -- very good series; and if you like these, check out the Albert Campion series with Peter Davison as well.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Campion-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00008DDXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Campion - The Complete First Season</a>",1263686400,63,4420,5.510355029585799
3986629,4,B002TY78PU,"Dorothy Sayers created a rather unusual sleuth in Lord Peter Wimsey -- think Bertie Wooster, except with a formidable crime-solving brain and a haunted past. And ""The Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries: Set 1"" brings together two of the solid BBC adaptations of her works, which are hampered mainly by the fact that the cast is a bit old for their roles.

In ""Clouds of Witness"" Peter is on vacation when he finds out that his brother, The Duke of Denver (informally ""Gerald""), is on trial for murder -- he had a blowup with his sister Mary's fiancee, Denis Cathcart, and the next morning, Cathcart was found shot through the heart by Gerald's gun, with Gerald bending over the body. The Duke stubbornly refuses to explain why he was out in the rain at three in the morning.

Peter is determined to solve the case, and quickly finds plenty of clues and odd little details, including the fact that Mary keeps lying (and changing her lies) and Gerald has some secrets that have to be unearthed. There are too many clues, and not enough motives. To save his brother, Peter must unravel plenty of lies and red herrings, and discover who wanted to do away with Denis Cathcart, and why.

""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club"" happens while Peter is lunching with his mentally fragile friend George Fentimen -- elderly General Fentiman expires in his chair. Because the exact time of death is unknown (and the general's sister died at around the same time), it's not clear who the inheritance is going to. And when the body is exhumed and examined, it's found that the old guy was actually poisoned.

Among the cash-strapped relatives are George (who's never recovered from WWI, is poverty-stricken and appears to be schizophrenic), his snotty brother Robert, and the artist Ann Dorland -- but theoretically any member of the Bellona Club could have done it. Of course, Peter is called on to unravel a snaggly mass of lies, deceptions, tricks and secret motives... and uncovers a devious plot that nobody could have guessed at.

The BBC did an excellent job preserving the spirit of Dorothy Sayers' classic mystery novels, steeped in the atmosphere of post-World War I England -- gentlemen's clubs, tweed jackets, wood-paneled manorhouses and flapper dresses. There's incisive wit in the dialogue, clever humor (""We need a new syntax! We need it now!""), and an array of characters from cutting-edge artists to fusty old gentry, from wussy socialists to flaky flappers.

Even better, these are genuine whodunnits. Both mysteries are tangles of lies, deceptions, infidelities, errors and the occasional bizarre twist such as Peter falling into a quicksand-like bog. In both cases there are only a few possible suspects and even fewer motives, but as the plot unfolds Peter wrangles out a sensible solution that explains everything (and usually without too many disasters along the way).

Perhaps the biggest problem of the story is that the cast is a bit long in the tooth: Ian Carmichael, Rachel Herbert and Anna Cropper are all at least a decade older than their characters are. It's a bit weird, especially since Carmichael is old enough to be his own character's dad.

But despite being in his mid-fifties, Ian Carmichael plays Wimsey with a light, incisive touch and a clever tongue (""I like facts... and there are remarkably few of them in this case""), and he's a likably plausible detective who can be steely when the occasion demands it. Glyn Houston is a warmly jolly Bunter, and he's sorely missed in ""Unpleasantness"" -- instead we get the lukewarm, forgettable Derek Newark.

""Lord Peter Wimsey Collection, Set 1"" has a cast that's a bit old for their roles. But otherwise it's a solid pair of murder mysteries that stick close to the original books.",1263168000,72,3748,4.889763779527559

I girded my loins and made a go of Set 1 at last, and sadly I found my disillusionment did not go away. I watched these productions in the 70s, and I remember liking them very much. Viewing them today, I must say I'm much less impressed. Like a few others, I think Ian Carmichael is just too old for the role, though he does a reasonable job with it. The series is dragged down, however, by self-consciousness about the period setting. Moreover, as at least one other reviewer has noted, the acting and direction are reminiscent of live theater rather than film -- there are pauses and glances meant to be significant which all to often become tedious and overly-long. And there is the usual problem with British productions of this era, where exteriors are filmed while interiors are shot in video, creating a subliminal (or not-so-subliminal) sense of discontinuity.

The stories are solid, the mysteries satisfying, and the characters interesting.  I particularly love the slower pacing that the length of each story allows: plenty of time is taken for local color, or to explain how bells are pealed, for instance.  The acting is uneven; sometimes it's pretty hammy.  The sets can be barely better than a stage play, and the props and paintings placed ""outside"" windows to give the illusion of a view are hilariously bad.

3986656,1,B002TY78PU,"A self confessed anglophile (as far as TV productions go) I was VERY disappointed. Read many of the wonderful reviews on here and ended up buying set One - glad that I bought just the one! If you must, RENT before you BUY.
I'd break down my criticism into two different categories:
1. The quality of the DVD transfer - IT WAS GOD AWFUL! We've watched and own to the manor born, yes prime minister and these are late 70's early 80's shows that show their age on a 55"" hi-def flatscreen TV but are enjoyable despite their graininess. Peter Wimpy is just dreadful in comparison to even these antiquated shows. The low light transfer makes the pictures incredibly grainy and the sets DO NOT LEND themselves to a hi-def environment. I suspect on my old CRT it may have been palatable- but only just! Perhaps between 1972 and 1978 the quality of productions/ technology improved? Again, I don't feel that expecting something of the caliber of `to the manor born' is too much to ask - by way of the technical quality of the transfer onto DVD. AGAIN, I am not talking about acting- just the inherent quality of the product - Think of a mono recording on SW radio being played through a 96 KHz blue-ray on a high end music system. A few minutes maybe - but the whole show!!
2. Now we get to the acting - contrived and of a bygone era. I felt the whole thing was pretentious to say the least. Nothing felt right, the sets, the period pieces on the screen - keep in mind this is supposed to be set in the 20's. I find myself comparing it to the set on Downton Abbey (same time period). Despite having reservations about that show, the cast/ acting (and of course the technological advances) and the sets were just superb - perhaps not a fair comparison. But I still can't get over the acting and the whole setup - reminded me of some bollywood production of yesteryear that immigrated to the BBC. Again, I love a show like Morse and was expecting perhaps something of that ilk- or Foyle's War maybe - but NO!

My criticisms undoubtedly reflect a generational divide. I just don't have patience for the really bad quality  - technical and acting. Perhaps for a generation that grew up in the 70s, watching this was remarkable, for me today - A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY! I hope fans of Dorothy Sayers forgive this critic for not being able to appreciate the BBC and Ian Carmichael's transgressions. Again,  RENT before you BUY!",1301270400,6,2411,4.450226244343892

Ian Carmichael is excellent as the noble Lord Peter Wimsey-part time sleuth of the upper class. From start to finish, the movie keeps you guessing as each suspect is put under Wimsey's ""microscope"".  It may seem slow to the typical American audience who wants each item developed and solved in minutes; however, that is the beauty of the BBC...it is so much more about the relationships developed along the way of the plot.

All three seem quite complex.  Makes me want to go back and re-read the books.",1291680000,2,376,4.723076923076923
3986659,2,B002TY78PU,I purchased both sets and my opinion is that the sets are to long which causes a great deal of confusion for the viewer.  There are many directions to focus on which takes one away from the the primary plot.,1287273600,2,207,4.175
3986660,4,B002TY78PU,"I first came to Lord Peter Wimsey on TV through the 1988 Edward Petherbridge versions.  And like some viewers, when I saw Ian Carmichael's version, I did not at first like it, finding him (a) too old and (b) too flippant as the sleuth.  But Carmichael has grown on me over the years, and I now enjoy him thoroughly as Lord Peter Wimsey.

Yes, at the time of filming, Carmichael was about 10 years too old for the part (which is why this review gives 4 stars instead of 5).  One either gets past that or one doesn't.  I have, and there are many virtues to appreciate in his portrayal.  I find Petherbridge's and Carmichael's respective Lord Peters to be complimentary: Petherbridge has the gravitas but lacks the light-hearted craziness; the reverse is true with Carmichael.  I would not want to be without either.

The adaptations themselves are excellent, with superb scripts that stay faithful to the books, and uniformly wonderful supporting casts (well, except maybe for Derek Newark's stale, flat Bunter, fortunately seen only in ""The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club"").  Isabel Jeans' Dowager Duchess (in ""Clouds of Witness"") is a special treat.  (""Well, he won't do muhduh heah - I won't have it!"").  David Langdon's Duke of Denver (also in ""C.O.W."") is excellent, too, although I keep seeing Richard Bellamy of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and so lose a bit of the not-too-bright country squire character that Sayers wrote.  Donald Eccles is perfect as the kindly, absent-minded Rev. Venables in ""The Nine Tailors.""  And there is luxury casting with Sheila Keith as a frosty, formidable housekeeper in ""Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.""

The DVD transfers are excellent, better than the previous DVD iteration.

Highly recommended, and essential to fans of Dorothy L. Sayers' mysteries - notwithstanding Ian Carmichael's wrinkles.",1286582400,7,1837,5.096989966555184
3986661,4,B002TY78PU,"Well-scripted, well-acted and well-directed, especially for the time, (filmed in early 70's).  If you like a good mystery with no in-your-face realism and good English scenery and mannerisms, this is for you. . .",1286236800,2,212,5.235294117647059
3986662,1,B002TY78PU,Watching grass grow or paint dry would be exciting by comparison.  The acting is painful to watch.  The product's only value is as a sleep inducer.  Very disappointing. It's too bad that I must award it even one star.,1286064000,3,217,4.512820512820513
3986663,5,B002TY78PU,"I am so happy they have re-released these great productions on DVD.  These DVDs are excellent quality with very good audio and video reproduction of the original TV shows.  If you are a fan of Dorothy Sayer's Lord Peter Wimsey, you will surely love these BBC productions.  Be sure to get both Set One and Set Two.  Good stuff!!",1285977600,2,327,4.491525423728813
3986664,3,B002TY78PU,"P. Bechdel's review below suggests that she anticipated something like what you'd see on PBS's ""Mystery!"" when she viewed these episodes.  She's apparently unaware that it was precisely because of the huge success of these adaptations on PBS's ""Masterpiece Theatre"" that ""Mystery!"" was commissioned in the first place, in order to show off similar period detective fiction as ""Rumpole of the Bailey,"" ""Cribb"" and ""The Racing Game.""

The production style of the Lord Peter Wimsey adaptations has certainly dated - it's standard three-camera videotape interiors and 16mm film exteriors, but it is every bit as sumptuous a production as anything else from British television in the mid-1970s.  The BBC knew the limitations of their productions, and made up for the lack of flashy camerawork, angles, edits and punchy scenes by incorporating lavish set design (in the first story by the legendary Ray Cusick) and a huge number of respected guest stars from the best of TV and stage, including Anthony Ainley, Kate O'Mara, Christopher Timothy, Peter Bowles and Paul Darrow.  The lengthy, pacey scenes will certainly take a little getting used to if you are unfamiliar with what British TV used to look like (and SOUND like - there's little to no incidental music), but LPW is absolutely worth the effort.

Set 1 is definitely the better of the two.  By the second, the scriptwriters were playing a little fast and loose with taking liberties - check out the teenage girl added to ""The Five Red Herrings"" to give Ian Carmichael somebody to flirt with - but the two stories in set 1 are pretty true to the books, apart from a couple of instances of Wimsey being uncharacteristically generous with money, probably a concession to 1970s audiences having a different attitude towards the tween-war class structure than Sayers' readers at the time they were crafted.",1283472000,15,1855,5.045751633986928

3986668,5,B002TY78PU,"Just a few technical notes regarding the new DVD reissue. The original DVDs have long been unavailable, so this new reissue is interesting. As best I can determine, the video quality is about the same as the original DVDs, and I wouldn't have expected it to be improved much if any. The new set I have viewed definitely does include English subtitles, which I don't recall being on the original set.

Note that interiors for the series were videotaped using very early PAL color TV cameras about the size of small refrigerators on wheels, which greatly limited their movement. Exteriors were filmed using mediocre-quality 16mm film stock (movies and U.S. TV shows use 35mm film which is 4X the size) and as a result are noticeably grainy and blurry when viewed on modern equipment; this was not nearly as obvious on the TV sets of 1972.

In ""Unpleasantness"" the amount of George Fentiman's inheritance in his father's will is 2,000 Pounds, which very roughly converts to something around US $125,000 in 2010. The value of the aunt's estate is mentioned as 600,000 Pounds; this was actually a staggering amount of money in 1928, and very very roughly converts to somewhere around US $40 million as of 2010, an amount certain to focus the intense interest of the heirs and lawyers!",1276473600,20,1279,4.8090909090909095
3986669,4,B002TY78PU,"While the Petherbridge fellow is quite civil, and probably looks more like the Sayers idea of Lord ""Petah"", his ever so sad sack look and demeanor would hardly get him invites to dinner at the Beauchamp-Menzies' very often.
  Ian Carmichael's Wimsey on the other hand, has a demeanor bordering on wimsy, and would easily be sought as a dinner companion by the most top drawer of society. His use of droppin' gs and use of ""ain't"" was quite in vogue with the posh crowd in the post Great War period.
  Carmichael in his earlier days did play ""Bertie Wooster"", and does at times give the impression of Wimsey possibly being at an earlier time, a member of Drones Club.
  This is a top hole Lord Peter in these first outings.
