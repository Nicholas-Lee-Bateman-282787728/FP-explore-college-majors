3945892,1,B002LFPABQ,this dvd does not play I don't know how they can brag about selling a million copies when it does not play. Save your money!,1361491200,,124,4.0
3945893,5,B002LFPABQ,I bought this dvd for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It teaches her about various animals in the jungle in a fun and an exciting way!,1342742400,,143,4.142857142857143
3945894,2,B002LFPABQ,"Item was advertised as having both English & Spanish language options and DID NOT.
This was the main reason I purchased these & I am very disappointed by the
misleading information.  Think others should be correctly informed.",1309132800,,225,5.081081081081081
3945895,3,B002LFPABQ,"I just got this DVD for my 2 year old thinking it would be fun and engaging, but she was bored with it instantly.  Each animal segment begins with a short informational segment in a movie theater style setting and is followed by live shots of the animal with instumental music in the background.  It may be better for older school-age children, but not for toddlers or preschoolers.  I do like that it is all live footage of the animals.",1259280000,,437,4.4375

8372609,5,B002LFPABQ,I only bought this cause my 2 year old daughter picked it out at a consignment sale.  It is great. Short intros to each animal and the ~5 minutes of video of that animal set to music. She loves it and asks for the elephant show all the time( and unlike a lot of baby geared shows it doesn't make me crazy to have on or watch over and over),1429920000,,339,3.842857142857143

8372612,4,B002LFPABQ,"A little different having a maggot section. Not the most baby friendly movie, but definitely informative, just maybe for when she is a little older.",1395360000,,148,4.96
8372613,1,B002LFPABQ,"Grainy, poor resolution.  Boring.  It did not hold my child's interest nearly as well as the ocean episode of the same series. Glad I rented before purchasing.",1383177600,,159,4.851851851851852
