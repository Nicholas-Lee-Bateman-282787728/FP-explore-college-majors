8111539,4,B000EN887A,"My review copy is digital  version of 2011.  It is a quality product with great pictures and Navajo history and culture.  Of particular interest is the rug-weaving and a religious ceremony by a medicine man.  It will be a good introduction if you have never been there.  I will be a memory if you have been there.  However, it will be better if it includes more of monuments.

It is still a good collection.",1385251200,,407,4.418918918918919
