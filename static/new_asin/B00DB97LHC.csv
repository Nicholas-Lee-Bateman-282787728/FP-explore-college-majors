5786956,5,B00DB97LHC,It's nice to see any TOS episodes released without the seamless branching used on the TOS blueray sets. I still holdout hope that they will re-issue the sets as CGI only without the annoying seemless branching.,1379721600,,210,4.861111111111111
5786957,2,B00DB97LHC,"If you really want to see Star Trek the right way. Get the season sets. And see it all like to should be seen..
I think this is just one waste of money. They are just trying to milk money out of you.
Just like they are with the Reboot bit they are pulling..",1379203200,3,257,3.7777777777777777
5786958,3,B00DB97LHC,"This five-episode compilation is obviously aimed at those new to ""Star Trek: The Original Series"", not those who can quote every episode or already bought all three seasons on Blu-ray.  If you enjoyed either of the J.J. Abrams ""reboot"" movies, this may be of interest as several of the main characters (most notably Khan, and obviously, Kirk, Pike, Spock and company) are seen here for the first time.  The season sets represent a much better value (especially since three out of these five episodes are from Season One), but if you're just looking for a quick primer this isn't a bad one.  There are also short new episode introductions by Rod Roddenberry (son of Gene, ""Star Trek""'s creator) that give a little bit of insight into each one.  Nothing major, but new fans may find them helpful.

My problem, though, isn't with the episodes...even though some of them are just here because they're important, not necessarily the best of the series.  The A/V quality is fantastic, too.  But only the remastered CGI versions are included, not those with the original 1960s effects.  These updated versions were created for the Blu-ray season sets, but fans also had the option of watching the original versions as well.  How can we ""see where it all began"" by ignoring these original versions?  What is this, ""Star Wars""?

So...four stars for the episodes and -1 for the missing original effects.  Again, new and casual fans might like this collection, but I'd still recommend just starting with the excellent Season One Blu-ray set for only $20-$30 more.",1378339200,19,1552,4.904214559386973
5786959,5,B00DB97LHC,"This is just a convenient compilation of some pivotal episodes that Star Trek Into Darkness (STID) thumbs its nose at. If you want good trek buy this, but stay away from STID that Amazon suggests is frequently bought with this, as yet, un-available Blu-Ray. Great episodes, good scifi but in opposition to STID. Trekkers and Trekkies alike should shun STID and love this. If you are not a Star Trek The Original Show (STTOS) fan, this Blu-Ray might hook you all by itself. If you're a fan of STID, then don't get this because STID contradicts a lot that is in the Blu-Ray, that's all I am saying. Two different, incompatible, irreconcilable universes. I'll take The Original Show any day thanks.",1377993600,6,695,4.75206611570248
5786960,5,B00DB97LHC,"While these are good episodes, there are other ones who also have their benefits. Somebody asked about ""Trouble with Tribbles"". It find this is a good parallel to Deep Space Nine's ""Trials & Tribblations"". For those who think they have every movie, may I suggest ""Of Men & Gods""? It is an indy film with many favorite Trek characters from almost every series.",1377475200,,359,4.714285714285714
5786961,5,B00DB97LHC,"No, this small collection of episodes is not at all intended for those who already own the complete Original Series on various formats (though it might end up in some completist's collection for sure)...It's rather a nice introduction to TOS to newcomers who happened to like the new Star Trek Into Darkness movie and want to explore the origins of all the important characters and races in this movie: Pike, Kirk, the Enterprise, Klingons, Tribbles and of course Khan...this 5-episode-selection re-introduces all important elements seen in STID, nothing more, nothing less... If you haven't seen these episodes and don't own the TOS box sets but happened to like STID, this product is for you...a really nice companion for casual viewers who don't want to buy the entire series but still want to understand where the STID elements originated from.",1374105600,29,848,5.107913669064748
5786962,5,B00DB97LHC,"""THE CAGE"", the first pilot starring Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike. Unfortunately he did not continue, thanks to his controlling wife. I do hope they used the color print and not the black and white that was the first one released on VHS.
""WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE"", the second pilot and Pike is replaced by Kirk. Story is very good if scientifically implausible. Not that something like that bothers me but for some reason in this it did.
""SPACE SEED"", My number 1 favorite episode of TOS. Ahead of its time story wise as can be seen by the science invoked. We now know 45 years later that eugenics and genetic engineering works differently than what we believed then. Still, a great story although I still don't believe Kirk could have won even by cheating. STID does it better.
""ERRAND OF MERCY"", The big bad of the Star Trek Universe 'The Klingons' make their first appearance. Another outstanding story but plot holes are problematic.
""TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES"". A fun romp in space with plenty of comedic characters. Don't really see how this fits into the ORIGINS idea but a nice diversion for those who need it. I would have preferred ""BALANCE OF TERROR"" which introduced the other big bad, the Romulans. The Romulans would never again be presented in this fashion, as Vulcans with passion. Later manifestations would turn them into unisex Frankenstein monsters. Don't know who was responsible for that but it totally ruined the opportunities presented by BoT and The Enterprise Incident.
Cudos to Rod Roddenberry.",1372982400,26,1536,4.888888888888889

5786977,4,B00DB97LHC,"I bought all the fan collective sets, and have all the series in one way or another. I like these shows, and the fact that the newer Star Trek movies have these characters is cool too. In the first Star Trek movie, the romulans went back in time, and changed the future, making the events in some of these not happen the same way. A lot of the reviews love or hate the new movies or old series. I love both, and the time travel, changing the past, is very star trek.",1393459200,,466,4.076086956521739
5786978,4,B00DB97LHC,"A good starter disc. But if you have the box sets you already have these titles,  There could've been a better selection of titles included here as well,,,This is a bare bones release. No special features, No commentary either,,,Also these are the newer versions with modern CGI graphics.",1391472000,2,288,5.0

5786980,5,B00DB97LHC,If you are a scifi fan and or trekkie or NOT you most likely will like the constant silliness of these old original series but so well done by the whole cast.  I always enjoyed it as a kid and as an adult and can watch the reruns on TV anytime.  This is a nice set commercial free to enjoy.,1385164800,,290,3.816666666666667

5786982,4,B00DB97LHC,"The recent release of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" has brought the legendary sci-fi franchise back to the forefront of pop culture. Unfortunately, not everyone who's seen J.J. Abrams' two movies is familiar with ""Star Trek's"" rich backstory and where many of the characters originally came from. Paramount Pictures and CBS Studios Blu-ray is taking measures to bridge the generation gap and give new fans a crash course in history with ""Star Trek: The Original Series - Origins.""

""Star Trek: The Original Series - Origins"" is made up of five of the first appearances of important characters recently revived in both 2009's ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" The episodes are introduced by creator Gene Rodenberry's son, Rod. We witness the introductions of Klingons, Tribbles, Khan, Captain Christopher Pike, James T. Kirk, and Spock.

""The Cage"" is the original pilot for ""Star Trek"" that never officially aired. Captain Christopher Pike commands the Enterprise with help from his second officer, Mr. Spock. It was turned down by the studio for being too slow and cerebral. Producers re-tooled it into what we know the series to be now.

Captain Kirk takes the helm of the Enterprise for the first time in ""Where No Man Has Gone Before."" It's officially the third aired episode of the series. However, it is the first one made after ""The Cage"" and responsible for the show being picked up for TV broadcasting.

""Space Seed"" introduces us to genetic superman Khan Noonien Singh and his group of followers. ""Errand of Mercy"" gives viewers their first look at the fierce Klingons. The cuddly, yet bothersome furry pets being dissected in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" are seen for the first time in ""The Trouble with Tribbles.""

Each episode is compiled from the remastered Blu-ray versions released a few years back. They include the digitally re-tooled special effects and space sequences. Needless to say, the picture is clean and the 7.1 surround sound makes the viewing experience even more spectacular than ever before.

""Star Trek: The Original Series - Origins"" isn't going to appeal to hardcore fans. They'll have all these episodes already in the sets released a few years back on Blu-ray. This is a great introduction to the world of ""Star Trek"" which first aired in 1966. Hopefully, new audiences today can appreciate these episodes and will watch beyond the two J.J. Abrams' films.",1380153600,6,2394,5.048101265822785
