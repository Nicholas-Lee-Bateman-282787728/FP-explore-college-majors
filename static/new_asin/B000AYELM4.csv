Go back to your piece of crap wrestling on the WWE, with the gay tag teams and horrible wrestlers. If you want talent, get this DVD. AJ Styles is this generations HBK. HE is just amazing to watch.

2397430,5,B000AYELM4,"Like my title says, AJ Styles is truely phenominal but he's far from being the top guy in the wrestling sport. A guy a few reviews bellow me wrote Michaels is the best, but I beg to differ. Shawn Michaels WAS the man in the early-late 90's, but now he isn't the top guy. In my opinion, the top guy in the sport today is Edge. He has natural charisma (something Styles lacks), he has great wrestling ability (just watch some of his matches), and he's definitely the person WWE can bank their future on. Edge has proven time and time again that although he is usually underrated in the WWE, he can still put on great matches. And he has had victories over Shawn Michaels (twice), Kurt Angle (Four times or more), Chris Benoit (a couple times), Eddie Guerrero (R.I.P, also a couple times), Chris Jericho (many times), and many others. So trust me, if there's a wrestler who truely deserves respect, it's the WWE Champion Edge. Anyways, this DVD is great and stronly recommend it.

IF YOU LIKE GREAT IN RING PERFORMANCES, THERE IS NO ONE BETTER TO WATCH THEN THIS GUY.  The only guy to win each belt in TNA 3 times and he is only 28!!  I mean he is not even 6 feet tall and pulls off one incredible move after another.  Watch him do a front flip and tell me the guy is not ""The Phenomenal One.""

I would give this dvd 5 stars, but it is a little dated, it gets 4 stars because it shows alot of Aj and that makes it worth the time alone.  The mix of matches are pretty good and any wrestling fan should check this out.",1151107200,,673,3.704225352112676

2397442,1,B000AYELM4,"If you want to see the most overrated superstar going today, then this is the dvd for you. I don't know how many people claim that he's the most talented, but they are a lot, and they are all wrong. He's a spot fest wrestler with no sense of in ring psychology. If you want the best wrestling dvd get Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story. It has a great documentary about the best wrestler ever, and has tons of great matches. AJ isn't pheonomenal, he's subpar!",1140480000,4,460,4.2988505747126435
2397443,5,B000AYELM4,"First of all I'd like to say AJ Styles/Samoa Joe is about on par with HBK/Angle.

The problem people have with wwe is that they have the same storyline running for usually a full calender year, and they become stale fast.

Most of the new guys can't wreslte at all. Sure HHH, HBK, and Angle can wresle but all the new guys are incredibly stiff. Cena, Batista, Masters, Carlito, Orlando Jordan who (would job in TNA by the way), the Boogey Man (WTF??!?!?!), I think you get the point.

PPVs are just extended versions of Raw or Smackdown and there are only a few good ones a year. WWE has about 4/18 good ppvs a year were as TNA has about 9-10/12.

As far as TNA goes sure the Heavyweight division lacks, but look at the X and Tag divisions, they completely blow wwe out of the water.

Interesting note that in your ""criticism"" of TNA, you didn't mention anything of how good WWE's tag division is. Well that's because you know it sucks. Hell 2 and 1/2 of another 2 of wwe's greatest tag teams of all time are in TNA.

Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Abyss, and yes AJ Styles can out wrestle 90% of WWE's roster. I mean come on are you seriously saying you don't think AJ Styles is better than Carlito or Orlando Jordan.

All I'm saying is WWE has a few good things going for it, but TNA is an extremely good breath of fresh air. And yes I did this whole review w/o cursing.",1136937600,3,1373,4.257692307692308
2397444,2,B000AYELM4,"The problem is that this was a DVD that was released in the early days of TNA (Nashville with the regular ring) and then re-released a few months ago with no updates on it.  This isn't the best AJ Styles matches as alot of the matches had outside interference & had AJ as a heel tryin' to get people to boo him instead of him doing what has made him standout today.  Basically if you want the best of AJ Styles in ""current"" TNA...check out the X division DVD.  There are some good matches on here but overall, this AJ Styles DVD just didn't interest me.",1135900800,5,553,4.19811320754717
2397445,5,B000AYELM4,"Let me just say this: this DVD isn't your normal WWF/E affair where the featured ""Superstar"" is practically the only wrestler featured on it. Fans of Jerry Lynn and Lo-ki can and will certainly appreciate this compilation as they are both prominently featured in this collection.

AJ Styles isn't exactly my favorite wrestler (if a wrestler is either overly promoted or overly hyped they immediately lose my attention), but regardless he is incredibly talented. Some of his spots are fairly unique to American wrestling, especially if you've been fed a diet of WWE snores and bores. His springboard 450 splash and springboard shooting star press are especially impressive. His finishing move--the Styles Clash--is a bit lackluster though (a face buster? How lame is that?!) But I digress.

The best matches on this collection feature AJ Styles, Jerry Lynn and Lo-Ki. This DVD is worth the price just to see those three go at it.

Anyway, if you consider yourself a true fan of wrestling I suggest you pick up this and TNA's ""The Best of the X Division"" DVDs.",1134604800,5,1058,4.899441340782123

2397455,5,B000AYELM4,"Plain and simple this is a must have for any wrestling fan. AJ Styles is arguably the best wrestler in the past five years. ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles is the new face of wrestling.",1133222400,,180,4.323529411764706
2397456,5,B000AYELM4,"AJ Styles is the RVD of TNA. He can pull of some amazing moves in the ring, unlike anything you've seen since the ECW days of RVD. Although he cant quite cut a promo like RVD can. While this dvd is worth the price, it shows what was once the future of wrestling. Im not knocking AJ here, he is still a great wrestler. TNA has signed so many WWE left overs that AJ just seems to have been put on hold for now. Which is too bad, since he can beat anyone on the rooster. If RVD signs with TNA, think of the amazing matches those two will put on. This is a great set of early TNA action, when they had four sides. Also pick up part two of the Style's saga.",1132444800,,652,3.873134328358209
2397457,2,B000AYELM4,"TNA may have some very good matches from time to time, but in the big picture they're really quite bush league and will never overtake WWE not even on the E's worst day. AJ Styles may be exciting to watch but he's basically just a spot-fest ala Jeff Hardy and will probably be technically crippled like Hardy if he doesn't alter his style. Two best reasons to watch TNA are Chris Daniels and Samoa Joe. They are the best wrestlers in the company but even they can't help TNA against WWE. Sorry fellas",1131408000,2,500,4.387096774193548
2397478,5,B000AYELM4,"People, please listen to me if nobody else, TNA is taking over...PERIOD. This is like nothing you've EVER seen before. If anyone who reads this saw BOUND FOR GLORY, you too had to take a shower afterwards, cause that was THE most discusting, and sickest sh*t you ever saw. And these guys aren't all just about high risks, they posses nothing but 200% pure, untainted talent. Take my advise, STOP WATCHING WWE TV. THEY ARE FORCE FEEDING YOU GUYS AND GALS PURE CRAP, and have been since after WM19. And I mean no disrespect to anyone in the wrestling buisness, but TNA is just better in so many ways. Example: If I were on my deathbed and saw A.J. Styles vs. Christopher Daniels in Ironman 2 I'd die a happy man. Earlier I read that A.J. styles ""may have what it takes to be one of the greatest superstars in the buisness."" Meaning what? He has to be in the WWE to be considered a friken superstar. BULLSH*T. What is WWE? Their biggest gimmick didn't do anything but a leg drop,(listen to Shane Douglas every once in a while). It sucks that a lot of people don't even look at another brand. I Guess WWE just makes people feel rich and above everyone else, and as long as they're in that comfort zone, then all is right with the world. Stop being concerned with names on the event card, and start being concerned with faces. Oh and only REAL ECW fans can chant ECW, not those fake WWE fans who think they had something to do with it, just cause daddy has the cash.

Now about A.J., I'd pay good money to see that man thumb wrestle himself. Just half of ONE of his matches would stand up to the entire history of WWE...PERIOD. And after that you have Petey Williams, Sabu, Jeff Jarret, Simon diamond, Raven, Matt Bentley, and so on. I'm begging TNN to put TNA Impact on the air on Friday nights to go agianst smackdown. All you'll hear is Joey Styles Going OH MY GOD!!! So in the end, buy this DVD, open your eyes to a whole new universe, and enjoy.",1131321600,,1945,4.314207650273224

2397481,5,B000AYELM4,"AJ Styles is the reason many people watch TNA, and rightfully so. Any one of his matches has him and his opponents bringing out the best for their fans.

Matches:

AJ Styles vs. Low Ki vs. Jerry Lynn vs. Psichosis

First ever X Division title match

Double elimination match:

This is a great, fast paced match. Double elimination means all the wrestlers had to be pinned twice in order to be fully eliminated.

Jerry Lynn and Styles were eventually the last two in the match with AJ being pinned once and Lynn not even being pinned yet. In the end AJ Styles pins Lynn twice in a row and becomes the first ever X Division Champion. 10/10

Triple Ladder Match

AJ Styles vs. Jerry Lynn vs. Low Ki:

Nice ladder match, all three men took some punishment. Cool part when Low Ki falls off a ladder but puts his foot on the top rope, regains his balance, and slides the ladder back up into the standing posistion. AJ tries the same thing but falls outside to the ring. Some great ladder spots and Lynn wins the X Division title. 9/10

AJ Styles vs. Sean Waltman

No Disqualifications:

Okay match, not much in the use of weapons but nice wrestling moves. Back and forth action and Aj's manager manages to knock Sean Waltman in the head and that allowed AJ to hit the Styles Clash and get the pin. 8/10

Aj Styles vs. Abyss

Falls Cout Anywhere:

Good match, a lot of crowd interaction as both men fight all through the arena. Styles manages to climb a balcony and jumps right on top of Abyss. Then as both men get back into the ring another ""fan"" who turned out to be Johnn Fairplay, throws a drink all over styles.

A botched table spot in the match, but Aj uses the table part that wasn't broken and hits a huge splash off the top rope onto Abyss and the referee. The ending sucked as security and wrestlers hold back both men for some unknown reason. 8/10

AJ Styles vs. D'Lo Brown

Ladder Match:

I always wondered what happened to D'Lo after he left WWE in 2003, and I see now he was making great ladder matches in TNA. This is one of the best on the second disk.

Both men use ladders, chairs, and tables. D""Lo jumps at least 20 feet off a ladder in the ring onto a table with AJ on it in a great spot. Siaki then appears and knocks D'Lo off a ladder out of the ring on top of another table. Both Styles and Brown climb the ladder and both pull the belt off a the same time. The ref declares AJ is still the champ. 9.5/10 [Not enough time for perfect score]

AJ Styles vs. Raven vs. Jeff Jarret

NWA TNA World Heavyweight Championship Match:

This is where AJ won his first heavyweight championship. Good match with all three guys working together and against one another. Raven gets cut open after a chairshot by Styles, then Jarret gets a leg drop on his head.

Shane Douglas comes out of nowhere and attacks Raven. He sends Raven through a table in the back area and disappears. Jarret and Styles fight some more and Styles wins after Vince Russo hits Jarret in the head with a guitar. 9/10

AJ Styles vs. Jeff Jarret

Steel Cage Match:

This match took place a long time later, when AJ won his second world heavyweight championship belt. Both men use some nice chain wrestling and use the cage against one another well throughout the match.

AJ almost falls in a scary moment after going to the top of the cage but Jarret hits the cage with impact, making Styles fall. Jarret grabs his guitar but Styles kicks it to peices right in midair. Styles wins his second title a few seconds later. 8.5/10

There are other matches listed as well,I just reviewed the ones I thought were the best

D'lo brown, Red and even X-pac has a great match with AJ. It's to bad Low Ki is not part of TNA anymore he so dam good. I know Low Ki from around my way and he's always telling me how he has just came back from Japan. TNA bring him back. TNA is nothing but hard working wrestlers.

The story line thing is played it's time for Action and TNA is all that. The WWE is so weak

there giving there belts to anyone and saying he has a belt let's call him a superstar.

The new so call stars can't sell out like the old stars can. The new stars can't sell a DVD

that's why there making so many old school wrestler DVD's. Warrior, l.o.d., Jake the snake,

Best of the 80's, The best of Undertaker. But the one I can't wait for is the Bret Hart Story due in late November that's price less. But for now TNA is the best wrestling on DVD and sat. on Spike TV. AJ STYLES RULES! TNA TNA TNA TNA TNA TNA!!!

This DVD showcases the most talented wrestler I have seen in recent years in ability, even surpassing a young shawn michaels as a previous person said, and based on the matches on this DVD, and recent encounters with Samoa Joe, i see him rising to the top.

8080718,3,B000AYELM4,"Regarded as one of the best and most innovative guys in pro wrestling AJ Styles has thrilled fans in the U.S. and around the world with his array of athletic moves and a never say die attitude. This is a 2-disc collection of some of his best matches from the early days of TNA up to April of 2004, even features some comments from the man himself about his matches, life on the road and what he does in his spare time.

-6/26/02, Elimination Match to Crown the First Ever X-Division Champion, vs. Jerry Lynn vs. Psicosis vs. Low Ki: A great contest here that sees all four guys with varying styles really gel well together. Its done double elimination style, with two guys starting out, once one is eliminated another comes in and it goes on like that until only one man remains. Psicosis and Styles start out with some good moves and AJ ends up hitting the the Styles Clash for the three, Low Ki comes in and hits a great array of kicks and unique offense including a flip into a dragon sleeper off the top. AJ does hit a facebuster into the a pin and covers for three, Lynn comes in quickly hits the cradle piledriver and covers Styles for three.

Psicosis is back in, has a good showing hitting a dive to the outside, however soon he falls to the cradle piledriver and Psicosis is gone. Low Ki is in, slams and kicks Jerry some, Lynn reverses a hurricarana off the top into a roll-up for two.  Jerry finally hits the Cradle Pildedriver and Low Ki is gone, AJ comes out fired up, they throw everything at each other and AJ hits the Styles Clash and covers for three. Ricky Steamboat comes in to be the referee for the final fall which despite Lynn and Styles' exhaustion they still go all out and it ends with AJ hitting the Spiral Tap off the top and covers for three to become the first ever X-Division champion. 10/10.

-8/7/02, Triple Threat Match for the X-Division Championship, vs. Jerry Lynn vs. Low Ki: These 3 do gel very well in this one, Lynn and Low Ki work on AJ early on, Styles used some shady tactics at points in this match (since he was a heel at this time). Each guy gets his spots in and a chance to shine, the pace is pretty constant, Styles takes a sick powerbomb out of the corner, Low Ki hits some hard kicks to both men and displays some nice submission moves like a dragon sleeper. There were a couple of nice spots involving all three men taking some hard spills, a good amount of nearfalls in the final minutes, each man uses the others finishers but only for two counts. AJ hits the Spiral Tap while Low Ki has Lynn covered but Low Ki stays on Jerry and gets the three count. 8/10.

-8/28/02, Triple Ladder Match for the X-Division Championship, vs. Jerry Lynn vs. Low Ki (Champion): Great one here where each man does something to top the other, while attempting to grab the title hanging above the ring. Loved how each mans style, while different mixed together very well, there's tons of spills, close calls and one great spot where while on a ladder Low Ki gets pushed off but balances on the rope and sends himself back into the middle of the ring (which brought the crowd to its feet). Lynn was finally able to hit the Cradle Piledriver on Low Ki from the ladder, then he climbed to the top and grabbed the belt to become the champ. 10/10.

-10/23/02, No DQ Match for the X-Division Championship, vs. Syxx-Pac (Champion): Fans will remember Syxx-Pac as X-Pac from his WWE days, this wasn't too bad of a bout, Pac hit a nice dive to the outside and he really takes it to AJ in the early going. Styles does hit the Spiral Tap but Pac kicks out, later he comes back with kicks and a sitout powerbomb for two. After the X Factor AJ manager interferes and gets nailed on accident by AJ, some good reversals by both men, Brian Lawler hits Pac in the head with a glass bottle, Styles hits the Styles Clash and covers to win. 5/10.

-10/30/02, vs. The Amazing Red: Better than the previous match as these two always did well when they faced off, nice exchanges in the beginning, great diving senton to the outside by Red. AJ takes over grounding the high flyer, using a nice brainbuster but just for two, Red does hit the Code Red but just two. Red kept fighting back trying to win the title but couldn't get three, neither could Styles no matter what he threw at the challenger. Great reversal of the Styles Clash by Red who hits a hurricarana, Red even hits one off the top rope but AJ rolls through and pins his shoulders to the mat for three. 8/10.

-5/7/03, w/D'Lo Brown vs. Elix Skipper & Low Ki: Not a bad tag match, AJ and D'Lo work very well together despite this only being their second match working as a team, there's the expected dirty tactics and stuff behind the refs back by Low Ki and Skipper as they work over Brown then AJ for a few. D'Lo hits a nice double leg drop, then a bit later hits the Sky High on Low Ki and covers to win. 6/10.

Disc 2

-6/11/03, Triple Threat Match for the NWA Heavyweight Championship, vs. Jeff Jarrett (Champion) vs. Raven: Due to having such anger towards each other Styles kept getting shoved to the side by Jarrett and Raven, who still had plenty of stuff to settle from their previous title match. It was a very intense contest, plenty of wrestling but more brawling, lots of close nearfalls, there was even some double teaming which lead to some good confrontations. Raven bled heavily, kept taking it to both guys, but Shane Douglas interfered and fought with Raven to the back. AJ uses the title belt, then the frog splash but only for two, Jarrett accidentaly knocks down the referee, Vince Russo comes down and hits Jarrett with a guitar, AJ hits the Styles Clash and covers to win. 9/10.

-7/23/03, Ladder Match for the NWA Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. D'Lo Brown: Decent one here as they battle up on the entrance ramp (attacks like those though always feel so ""staged"" to me), they fight all around the ring, D'Lo throws the ladder at Styles when he attempts a dive to the outside. Later AJ does hit a dive diving senton to the outside, both men go for the belt and take some falls from the ladder. Great spot where D'Lo hits the Low Down off the ladder crashing through AJ and a table, but when he goes for the belt Sonny Siaki runs in and sends Brown off the ladder to the outside. They fight at the top, both fall off the ladder with the belt in hand and the referee rules AJ keeps the title. 6/10, cause of the interference.

-8/13/03, NWA World Heavyweighy Championship Match, w/Vince Russo vs. Low Ki: Another decent one here they both just try to wear down each other in the beginning, basically if you have seen one match between these two you know what to expect, some great exchanges, stiff kicks from Low Ki and high flying moves from Styles. One problem I have with this match is it doesn't seem as fluid in parts as their other bouts, some of the spots seem a bit awkward to me. Things finally pick up in the closing minutes where it looks like Low Ki will capture the ultimate prize, he even takes Russo out but the referee doesn't see AJ use a baseball bat on Low Ki then covers him to win. 6/10, for the cheap finish.

-11/19/03, vs. Abyss: Size vs. speed here as Abyss overpowers and chokes out AJ, who employs a bit of a hit and run offense as he tries to chop down the big 6 foot 8 inch monster. Styles gets busted open during this one after taking a bad spill to the outside, Abyss targets the head wound with fists and slams him into the steel steps. AJ counters a powerbomb attempt to a facebuster, but hits a missle dropkick on the referee on accident. A 450 splash off the top but no ref, Abyss hits a chair shot but just two, then he tosses the ref out of the ring. Styles hits a sunset flip powerbomb onto a chair but just two since a new referee came down to the ring to make the count. Abyss sends AJ into a chair in the corner, but somehow AJ kicks out, Styles hits a massive chair shot then a roll-up for three. 7/10.

-3/3/04, Falls Count Anywhere Match, vs. Abyss: Better than the previous contest as this was more hardcore and more hard hitting, they really gave it their all here as they fought more out of the ring than anything. Sick spot where Abyss sends AJ into the crowd on the concrete floor, another sees Styles do a dive off the balcony onto Abyss. Back in the ring Abyss hits a splash crushing a chair into AJ's chest but just for two, AJ gets a huge Black Hole Slam but Styles kicks out. Loved the German Suplex spot into a pin by AJ only for two, then a Styles Clash for another two, the referee gets crushed in a splash by AJ onto Abyss through a table. With that being the third referee taken out, security comes out to seperate them for some reason. 7/10, for the weak finish.

-4/21/04, Steel Cage Match for the NWA Heavyweight Championship, vs. Jeff Jarrett (Champion): After Chris Harris was injured Vince Russo named a new challenger to face Jarrett which turned out to be AJ, this was a good but not a great contest. They chop, punch and kick each other in some good exchanges, both taste the steel wall in some good spots, nice trio of back suplexes by Jarrett but only for two. AJ finally gets the advantage but isn't able to keep the champ down for three, Jeff throws powder into Styles eyes but he won't stay down. They attempt the others finishers, AJ hits the Styles clash just for two, AJ gets knocked off the top of the cage to the floor. Back in the ring Jarrett is able to get the guitar but Styles hits a dropkick shattering it, then hits a crucifix pin and gets the three to win the title. 7/10.

This is a decent collection of some good matches of his, though about half of them are available on other dvd sets and the vast majority after the 3 opening multi-man matches either have too much interference or just are decent but not great. The comments from AJ are nice to hear but his second DVD release is far, far better than this.",1347062400,2,10170,4.328083989501312
