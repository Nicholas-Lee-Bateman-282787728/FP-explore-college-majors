8012373,3,B0001GNULE,"This film is the pilot for the short-lived (only four episodes after this pilot movie) Robert Conrad series titled ""The Duke."" Created by Stephen J. Cannell, it's the story of Duke Ramsey, an over-the-hill boxer who loses a match against a fighter who's not much more than half his age. During his final boxing match, someone robs the box office. Then, Duke's manager, Benny Lyle, is murdered, and Duke sets out to find his killer. Red West--Elvis Presley's former bodyguard, a cast member of Conrad's ""Black Sheep Squadron,"" and a member of ""The Wild, Wild West""'s company of stuntmen--plays the antagonistic police detective who's assigned the case...In the short-lived series that followed, Duke opened a bar called 'Benny's Place' and worked part-time as a private eye...Larry Manetti provides the comic relief in a role that's nearly identical to his later role as Rick on ""Magnum, P.I.,"" the hustler who does leg work for the show's main character...The picture quality of this VHS tape is about what you would expect, acceptable but not great. The ""Up Against The Odds"" title was added to the film for its video release. Interestingly, there is a British ratings certificate on the very beginning of the film, which means it was probably shown as a feature film in Europe...The story itself is typical late-1970s TV detective fare. But, since this is pre-""A-Team"" Stephen J. Cannell, the story-telling is still emphasized over explosions and other action...If you're a Conrad and/or Cannell fan (and you don't have to pay too much for it), this is worth a look...By the way, the film only lasts 93 minutes. (It was, originally, shown in a two-hour time slot on network television.) I don't know why the running time is listed as 109 minutes in the description, but 93 minutes is the actual running time.",1368316800,,1810,4.957236842105263
