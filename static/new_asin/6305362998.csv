1012568,5,6305362998,"I had to search to find this movie when it was released to theaters in October 1998 because of the limited release due to the MPAA's NC-17 rating.  It was well worth all the struggle to get to it.  I am a huge fan of Trey  Parker and Matt Stone.  I thought ""BASEketball"" and  ""Cannibal! The Musical"" was hilarious.  But when I walked out of  the theater from ""Orgazmo"", my stomach muscles literally hurt  from all the laughing I did.  This is one of the funniest movies you'll  ever see.  It is about Joe Young (Parker), a Mormon Missionary who gets  pulled into the porno industry to try to earn money for his upcoming  nuptuals.  He is the porno superhero, Orgazmo, and he becomes a big hit.  I  don't want to tell you too much, but don't miss seeing this movie.  I am  buying it at full price.  I don't want to wait and you won't either!",921110400,,840,4.235668789808917

The sex is usually clothed or some humping motions for comedic effect with some other silly dialogue. Brief (if not none) female nudity. Instead you'll get plenty of harry bob and manass.

1012873,5,6305362998,"Orgazmo is, as another reviewer put it, ""criminally underappreciated"" (or was it ""underrated""?) Speaking of being underrated:  get it: ""underRATED""...the fact that Orgazmo received a completely unwarranted ""NC-17"" rating is why you haven't heard of this film, unless you happen to be among that cult of Trey & Matt, e.g.,  you love South Park, including the movie version (although, the series, on Comedy Central, after Bigger, Longer, Uncut... just kept getting better & better each season, until, e.g., after watching a whole bunch of season 12, onward, then go back & watch the SP movie, you're sorta disappointed the 2d time around; after the more recent decade or so of South Park on TV, the 1999 movie seems rather tame!) you've seen Baseketball, Cannibal! The Musical, Team America: World Police and, of course, Orgazmo (which is one of Robert Smith's favorite flicks, according to Robert Smith -the Robert Smith from The Cure).  As far as that NC-17 BS, yes, it is really stupid that this got an NC-17 rating even though there's very little nudity & even the language shouldn't affect it much, either.  So why, then?  IMO, Trey & Matt refused to bow to whatever pressures they got from whichever studio it was, putting this one out.  This is one thing that's made South Park such a crazy-funny, LOL show: those 2 are the main writers. If you see the ending credits to each episode, you notice that Matt & Trey are always credited as writers for 'em all.  That shows good continuity and it's no wonder SP has worked out so well:  they did it their way!!  Same with this movie, Orgazmo:  Trey was the principal filmmaker on this one, having directed it (and, I think he wrote the screenplay by himself, can't recall, for sure.  It's just laugh after laugh after laugh in Orgazmo.  Oh -and one more thing about the NC-17 rating the movie got:  when your film gets an NC-17 rating, it's basically the kiss of death:  w/that rating comes a decided lack of marketing/advertising as well as a shrunken amount of theaters willing to show the movie at their theaters, etc. So, by the time it comes to DVD and after - people aren't aware of it the way they would've been had it only had an ""R"" rating.  Glad Amazon has this title available!  Since this one's never on Netflix & because I dropped cable TV: too expensive, I only use my laptop: watch movies on Netflix or YouTube (yes, there are movies uploaded on YT) and other stuff.  As for Orgazmo, though, I'm going to get my own copy, since it's a hard-to-find title because of the aforementioned reasons stated above.  Anyway, see this film!!  It is hilarious!  A great escape for about 95 minutes or thereabouts.",1478304000,,2666,4.69247311827957

1013273,3,6305362998,"This is a Trey Parker film who takes a another swipe at Mormons. A missionary (Trey Parker) in LA gets sucked into the porno industry. Meanwhile his co-star had really invented an orgazmo ray.

Trey Parker has done so much better than this. The humor was sophomoric and slap stick with marginal attempts at satire. I watched the unrated version and part of the rated version and apparently the only real difference is a few lines with F-bombs. I would recommend watching the rated version with either the drunk or crazy commentary, like an MST-3000 thing. It is a lot funnier that way.

The DVD comes with subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.

F-bomb, sex, nudity- mostly male hairy butts. One brief shot of Julie Ashton. Nudity in extras.

Over the years I come back to this movie, and always enjoy it, from the theme song, to the script, etc.
Don't expect a Hollywood budget. This was very early in their careers, and it's very evidently low budget, but all the better for it.
This movie has some of the funniest one liners, often supplied by Matt Stone, ""you know, I don't want to sound like a queer or nothing, but Depeche Mode is a SWEET band."" Trey's hamster evoking science savvy sidekick has some great moments too.

Ron Jeremy appears to give it porn cred, but there is no real porn in this movie. It is really about faith and how hard it is not to be influenced by the world around us.

The idea of a Mormon becoming a porn star is funny, but then the story gets bogged down with too many stupid stereotypes and conventions in the porn industry without satirizing anything new or in a different way.

Innocent Utah-raised Mormon missionary to Los Angeles Joe Young just wants to do his duty to the Lord, and maybe find a way to satisfy his fiancee's desire to get married in the LDS temple.  Fate (or Jesus, depending on your view) interceeds and sends him to knock on the door of porn king Maxx Orbison, in the middle of his new opus, 'Orgazmo', a poorly acted skin flick about a superhero. Maxx soon sees that Joe is just the kind of guy he needs to play his hero, and convinces him to take over the role of Orgazmo with the assurance he won't actually have to do the actual sex part as well as a hefty sum.  Enough to make Joe's fiancee happy plus a nest egg left over.  Joe takes the job, meets people he would never have had contact with otherwise, discovers that what you do isn't who you are, and in the end, finds Orgazmo is more than a role, it's a gift from God.

But when he meets porno-director Maxxx Orbison, who won't take no for an answer, he becomes the title charecter. Now, I'm not always the best judge of charecter, but the director Mr. Orbison has too much authority that I found rather unbelievable. Basically, because he makes so much money, he thinks no one can refuse him, let's just say he finds out otherwise the hard way.
If you're a fan of South Park, the poor taste humor will be more than enough to amuse, however this film could've just as easily been rated R as opposed to X, oh well. There's barely any nudity for one thing, plus the so-called sexual content is mostly simulated.",1305158400,2,812,4.568493150684931

  The movie is about a mormon named Joseph Young, who is in town on a mission trip from Utah. During his door to door mission to share his love of Jesus Christ with anyone willing to listen, he stumbles into a home where an adult movie is being shot. While Joseph is defending himself againts a group of security guards working the set, the producer decides Joseph is perfect for the lead in his "" action, adventure, porno "". The producer, Max Orbison, then offers Joe $20,000 to participate and assures him that he will use a stuntman for all of the scenes that require penetration. Joe accepts his offer, so that he can get the money he needs to marry his true love Lisa in the temple back in Utah. Thus Orgazmo is born. The super hero who takes on crime with his orgazmarater, a laser attached to his arm that gives his enemies an orgazum, thus distarcting them and giving him an advantage in the fight.

  Then life starts to imitate art when Choda Boy makes a real orgazmarater and then the boys discover that Mr. Orbison is an evil man,that must be stoped.

For any of you that are familiar with Trey Parker's work, this is it at it's best! The character's in the movie are all hillarious from Choda Boy, Sancho, the [...] twins, Ron Jeremy, Matt Stone there too many to name them all.

1014921,4,6305362998,"Orgazmo was a rough little gem that came out awhile back.  Since it concerns the porn industry, and it was written and directed by the one of the men responsible for South Park, it got slapped with an NC-17 rating.  If you don't believe that there is bias in the movie ratings, check this movie out.

It's the story of a young Mormon played by writer-director Trey Parker, who during one of the stops on his route to enlist more Mormons, catches the eye of a pornographic movie director.  Enthralled by Elder Young's (Parker, whose character name is one of the many ironic hints this movie provides) acting abilities, hires him to play the lead in his new adult superhero video, Orgazmo.

Obviously, Elder Young wants no part of this, but when he gets offered the money, which he needs to afford his wedding, and is given the stipulation that he will not be performing any of the sexual acts himself (they'll use a different actor for the intimate moments), he reluctantly agrees.

What unfolds is a series of events that spoofs all movie devices, demonizing the porn industry for causing great pain within the community.  Elder Young, along with his on-screen sidekick, Choder Boy (Dian Bachar -- a hilarious and underused character actor), become in real life the superheroes they play in the movies.  Armed with their martial arts (which all Mormons and half-pint science whizes seem to know) and Elder Young's Notorious Orgazmo Ray, the two ""superheroes"" -- Orgazmo and Choder Boy -- set out to destroy the porn studio that they are employed by.

Here's the kicker, though.  You'd think that this movie would be really, really dirty.  And it is, for its part.  There are f-bombs in it, but not nearly as many as in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (which had an R rating), no actual simulated sex (though, for its part, had a few simulated orgasims by men hit by the Orgazmo Ray), and the only nudity is men's butts, seen quickly as an in-joke, where a naked man always stands in front of the camera, blocking the porn sex.  There's also a tiny bit of goofy, non-believable violence, but nothing worse than an average episode of Might Morphin Power Rangers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

You'll have to watch the movie to understand why it never deserved an NC-17 rating.  And, once you know that, you'll probably be upset by the fact that you never got the chance to see this movie outside of video or late night Cinemax airings.  It's not the greatest movie ever made, nor is it even Trey Parker's best movie, but it is definetly worth the watch, if, for nothing else, to see real life porn star Ron Jeremy play one of the bad guys who gets his head crushed in one of the movie's very badly choreographed fight sequences.",1178496000,3,2734,4.629399585921325

1014980,4,6305362998,"Just when you think the comic genius minds of Trey Parker and Matt Stone can't go any further, they think of an odd, controversial movie like Orgazmo.  It's the best Mormon, porn, comedy I've ever seen.

Joe Young is a quiet Mormon boy who is out on a mission trip to impose his beliefs upon others (aka. Spread the word).  He really wants to get married to his sweetheart (probably a freak waiting to break out of her shell - Preacher's daughter syndrome), who is basically a moron, but at least she is as stereotypical as possible, which makes it funnier.  Well, the opportunity to make some money in the porn industry entices Joe, as it would nearly every grown man in the world (any guy who says otherwise is most likely either a liar or gay), to do something he knows he shouldn't do, and the cleaver chaos ensues.

Maxxx Orbison, a big time porn king, is looking for a new lead male in one of his upcoming movies (Orgazmo); only, he needs a tough guy.  After watching Young beat down several of the porn king's henchmen, Orbison is convinced that he has found his man.  Young's convinced that he can get away with being in a porn because he's positive it'll never be seen, and he'll never be recognized.  It's kind of like having a comedy special about the Amish on HBO.  Anyway, the deal-sealer for Young is that any and all penetration will be performed by a stunt-cock; Young ensures that the clause is in the contract.

The satire and parody of religion as well as the porn business are shameless and hysterical.

Young's porn sidekick, Choda Boy, is a nerd by day, porn star by night who has invented the Orazmorator, a device that, when shot, causes orgasms.  He defeats all enemies with his weapon because his preferred style of self-defense, Hampster Style kung fu, is too dangerous to unleash on any enemy.  So, in other words, they somehow uncovered and stole my entire life story.

In addition to Parker, Stone, and Choda Boy, there are actually several real porn stars in the film.  Julie Ashton, Chasey Lain, and Jill Kelly provide some nice scenery and realism to a movie about the porn industry.  Although, it must be known that ""The Hedgehog"", Ron Jeremy, is also in this movie, and somehow endures in porn, despite his disgusting appearance.

This movie is crude, most won't like it, even more will not get it, and it takes a certain kind of person to appreciate and laugh while watching.

Orgazmo is a 'super hero' with the unlikely secret identity of a Mormon named ""Joe Young"" {Trey Parker}, who gets caught up in the sinemaerotica industry. Predictably at odds with himself, this persona becomes much more personal when Maxx Orbison {Michael Dean Jacobs}, a crooked Porn Director has his hoods abduct Young's fiance' Lisa {Robyn Lynn Raab} in order to blackmail him into continually portraying this character.

After a day of proselytizing, he and his cowardly partner arrive at a mansion where their unwanted imposition is met with a Bruce Lee style scene, wherein Young prevails as he displays surprising Martial Arts skill, to the delight of Orbison, who manipulates him with promises of expedient and copious payment into the starring role, so long as he does not have to actually have intercourse with the performers, to which a so-called ""stunt cock"" stand-in is employed. His sidekick ""Choda Boy"" {Dian Bachar; who wears a helmet displaying a flopping artificial appendage} invents a ray gun for Orgazmo which produces an instant orgasm in those effected, and the hilarity begins when they try it out on several unsuspecting people from Rabbis to old ladies.

Prompted by threats upon a friend ""G-Fresh"" {Masao Maki; a veritable 'Hip-Hop'-loving black man trapped in a Japanese man's body} from Orbison's goons, Joe Young sets out to actually become Orgazmo fighting crime, where they tussle with the mugs at a fetish club, until the eventual confrontation with Orbison himself back at the mansion to free Lisa from his clutches.

Contrary to previous desires to return to Utah and marry at the Mormon Temple, Joe and Lisa decide to remain in Los Angeles with Choda-Boy Ben to save it from its 'sinful ways', after quite literally receiving a 'thumbs-up' from an apparition of hippie Jesus, despite seemingly ignoring their ""heavenly father's"" wishes to avoid all initial involvement in the beginning, most dramatically diplayed with an earthquake.

Matt Stone plays ""Dave the lighting guy"", a mullet-sporting latent homosexual continuosly displaying Freudian slips and prefacing statemets with ""I don't want to sound like a queer, but...""

Narcoleptic porn-troll Ron Jeremy predictably plays a minimal role as one of the performers, along with other established participants Chasi Lain and Julie Ashton, two airheaded and silicone-enriched bimbos.

Bonus features include ""The Book of Orgazmo"" detailing the evolution of this character, and discusses Parker's obscure ""Cannibal The Musical"" and ""Timewarped"" creations. Also included are interviews, behind-the-scenes featurettes, outtakes and bloopers, a ""drunken commentary"" of the film option, and a photo gallery.

And remember, ""I am Sancho!""",1131926400,,736,4.75
1015061,4,6305362998,"Forget Baseketball.  This is the best movie to come from the minds of the creators of South Park.

The premise of the movie is so ridiculous that it's funny.  The acting is also so horribly overdone that you would have to laugh at it, even if you laughed at nothing else.  Yet how can you not laugh at Choda Boy: a nerdy guy who gets into porn to be with beautiful women.

Choda Boy, off-screen, is really a technical wiz, who actually creates an orgazmarator (the ""weapon"" Joe Young uses as Orgazmo to render his foes helpless by, you guessed it, throwing them into an immediate state of orgasm).  Choda Boy also has a dark and hidden past.  He chooses to give up a karate technique called ""Hampster Style"", as he believes it to be far too dangerous to unleash even on his most dastardly enemies.  He often dons a hat topped with a huge dildo and wears a porn-styles utility belt, equipped with *ock rocket, which he uses in his adventures as Orgazmo's sidekick.

Another hilarious character is played by Matt Stone.  He is a set-hand for Max Orbison who tends to get over-excited on the set and call out hilarious obscenities.  He also makes sexually questionable comments to Joe (Orgazmo) in between shoots, including ""I don't want to sound gay or nothin, but I think Depeche Mode was a sweet band"".

Orgazmo meets his arch nemesis, named A-Cup.  A-Cup has no nads- and so Orgazmo's orgazmarator is useless against him.  A-Cup is quite a character on and off-screen.  He has the habit of farting on his co-stars and generally being a bastard.

This is one of those movies that most people comprising the general public won't ""get"" or appreciate.  Yet for those of us who appreciate senseless humor, we have a cult classic on our hands.",1131494400,12,1738,4.590909090909091

He just wants to finish his mission, move back to Utah, and marry his sweetie in The Temple. But that takes money.

Then one house gives him a very warm welcome (after he kicks the poo out of a half-dozen goons), the money he needs for the wedding she wants, and a job. A starring role in a VERY adult film. He's the super-hero, Orgazmo, with the mysterious power to throw the throes of ecstasy over his enemies, rendering them helpless. It was just a silly fiction --

The fiction turns real. The rest is predictable inanity. His fiance finds out, and then is taken hostage by the evil smut-mongers. His mysterious power conquers all, and even takes control of vicious guard dogs, turning them into vicious leg-humpers. Orgazmo (and his sidekick Choda Boy) wipe out the bad guys, save the girl, and get a sign from The Good Lord that this is John's chosen path. But there's a sequel brewing. ""Neutered Man"" is brought to life in the operating theater, and may be immune to Orgazmo's powers.

This offends women. It offends men. It offends religion. it offends little old ladies (one of whom is reduced to a rub-rub on her walker). It offends the adult film industry. It offends the easily offended, who don't want their righteous offense besmirched by offense against such low goings-on. Did I leave anyone out?

On the whole, I'd give this one a miss. See something more culturally enlightening, like Rocky Horror. See something more intellectual, like Animal House. Maybe, though, you've forgotten how good taste differs from bad taste. In that case, go ahead and enjoy the reminder.

1015165,4,6305362998,"""Orgazmo"" is not quite as funny as I remember it being when I first saw it.  Perhaps because I'm older, or perhaps because I'm not under the influence of anything.  Still, it's a darn funny film, and if you love South Park, it's worth checking out, especially now that the Special Edition is out.

The SE comes on one two-sided disc, with side A containing the remastered film and the ""unrated"" edition, which seems superfulous as the film was already NC-17(though the only nudity in the film is of men's bare rear ends, a running gag throughout).  If you've seen the DVD of ""Cannibal! The Musical"", you'll be delighted to know that Matt, Trey and Co. have made another drunken commentary.  It's not as funny as the ""Cannibal"" commentary, because this film isn't awful and because they start out drunk this time, so it doesn't build to drunken wackiness so much as start there.  There are two other commentaries on the disc, one featuring some of the real porn stars in the film, including Ron Jeremy, who is apparently a very nice guy, though not all that adept at commentary.  The third commentary is the celebrity cameo commentary, with Dave Foley, Wierd Al Yankovic, and two dead directors ""John Ford"" and ""Akira Kurasawa"" commenting how they both came up with the idea first.  It's ok, not brilliant, but diverting.

Side B contains 40 minutes of bloopers, complete with more drunken commentary, 30 minutes of deleted scenes with commentary, and a good making-of doc called ""The book of Orgazmo"", which is a nice look at the film, if nothing special.  Trailers round out the disc, including a rather funny fundraising trailer made only to show to potential investors.  It's almost like a mini version of the film.

Orgazmo fans have long awaited this edition.  It's been pushed back countless times.  Now it's here.  If you're a fan, but this sucker.  If you're interested, rent it, and if you love it like so many do, buy it, as I can guarantee repeated viewings.",1115596800,4,1969,4.730205278592376
1015166,5,6305362998,"Back in the old college days, a buddy of mine brought this film to my house because of my love for Cannibal! The Musical. I've always been a sucker for the ""campy classic"" flicks, but after a few minutes I was an Orgazmo fanatic. It has since become one of my most often recommended (and qouted in drunken stupors) films.

Clean cut Mormon Joe Young (Tom Hung) stumbles onto a porn shoot while on a LA mission by beating up a threatening bouncer. Seeing his skill, the film's director convinces him to star in it despite his trepidation, mainly since his royalties could pay for a good wedding to his equally clean cut girlfriend. Things get out of hand when his girlfriend visits him and discovers the truth. Throughout this plot development, we are blessed with countless outrageous sex-gags, porn star cameos, and Trey Parker's uncanny ability to make an audience laugh uncontrollably. The aforementioned, who wrote and directed Orgazmo, does a wonderful job of making such an entertaining movie while on-screen most of the time, and his supporting cast, including the poster-child of geekdom Dian Bachar, are equally great.

The DVD features some great extras, as well as the original NC-17 version and a new, uncut Unrated version that doesn't seem all too much different. Don't miss the multiple cast/crew commentaries, especially the drunken commentary recorded during a binge at Parker's home. Lastly, don't let the NC-17 rating throw you off: this movie should have an R rating, and kudos to the filmmakers for not justifying their material to suit the MPAA. 100% recommended and mandatory.",1113264000,14,1599,4.98501872659176

For all those that don't know this is a film made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park. This gives the film credit but also takes some away.

Trey plays a Mormon who happens to show up on the doorstep of a house making a porno film, Orgasmo. Hes there to spread the word of God, ###but after seeing he fights better than the person playing Orgasmo, the director wants him for the main part. But its okay, hell get what they call a ""stunt""...piece for the intimate scenes.### He agrees and so the film begins.

Thats it. Seriously. The rest of the film was basically just funny events. Some of them were really funny i will say. But this is Trey and Matt. I thought surely putting a religious person in the porn world would produce SOME kind of social commentary. Alas, there is none to be had here. Or perhaps its just so overshadowed by the comical happenings that it gets completely washed away. This left me dissapointed in the film as a whole.

Not regular Trey and Matt, but enough of them to make it worth a watch. Not sure itll be one i can watch and laugh at over and over again. For that youll need BASEketball!",1112832000,,1178,4.316742081447964
1015168,3,6305362998,"When I first heard that Orgazmo was coming out on DVD I was really excited.  Not only would I get a hilarious movie on DVD, but there would also be a ton of extra features.  Unfortunately this disc turned out to be one of the worst special editions I've ever seen.

The box has unrated plastered across the top of it.  Seeing this you might think that the unrated version of the movie (which is included on the disc with the NC-17 version) would have more foul language and skin.  But instead it's just a different edit of the movie.  Some character development scenes are missing and the opening is edited very differently.  There are a couple bits of missing dialog in the DVDA scene, but the stuff in the theatrical version was funnier.  I'd say stick with the theatrical version, it's a much better movie.

First up in terms of special features are the commentaries.  The first with Trey Parker and Matt Stone being drunk was alright, but the audio was messed up throughout the whole thing.  Sometimes you had to strain your ear to hear what they had to say.  But this commentary is genius compared to the other two, which are two of the worst commentaries ever.  The cast commentary has the same audio problems, but no one has anything interesting to say.  If you like hearing a room of people try to talk over one another then this commentary is for you.  The ""wild"" commentary seemed like a good idea, having people who had nothing to do with the movie talk about it.  But instead we get Weird Al Yankovic not being funny, Dave Foley not being funny, and assorted others doing lame impersonations.  The only good part was with Kevin Smith, but he's never even seen Orgazmo.

There are plenty of other features on the second side of the disc, but nothing really recommendable.  There are 30 minutes of deleted scenes that are interesting but were right to be cut.  There is optional commentary on these but it's only Trey and Matt laughing hysterically while drunk.  Then there are 40 minutes worth of outtakes, some are funny but it's just overkill.  The documentary ""The Book of Orgazmo"" is alright, but more time is spent trying to be jokey then telling the actual story of making the movie.  The Dragon Con interview is the worst feature.  While some good questions are asked you won't be able to easily hear them because the sound was messed up the whole time.  At the start of the interview you just watch Trey drink a soda while they try to get the sound fixed, this goes on for about 5 minutes.  Universal also does annoying zoom ins whenever Trey takes a drink from his soda because it's from McDonald's.  Guess they didn't want to give them free advertising.  Some EPK interviews are included but we've already heard everything in them before. There are a couple of trailers, one that was shown in theaters and a fake trailer made to raise money for the movie.  Apparently Universal thought people wouldn't understand that there were jokes in this section so the have THIS IS A PARODY covering the bottom of the screen throughout the whole thing.  Lastly there's 15 minutes of behind the scenes footage and some stills.  And that brings us to the end of another messed up Universal DVD.  I give it 3 stars for the movie.",1112572800,17,3236,4.554592720970537
1015169,3,6305362998,"Despite the provocative title, ""Orgazmo"" is not as outrageous as it would like us to think it is.  Either that or we have finally caught up with Trey Parker's raunchy sense of humor.  The film purports to be a parody of the porn industry and it does take it's shot at that world but in it's heart it's a send-up of comic-book action films.  The film has it's share of inspired moments but it's not as consistently funny as Parker's later efforts, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut"" and ""Team America:World Police"".  I recommend this film to Parker fans.  It's not a bad film in the least it's just that Parker has evolved and honed his comic skills beyond what is on display here.",1112572800,,681,4.504065040650406
1015170,3,6305362998,"First I want to start off by saying this movie is brilliant and I am a huge fan of Matt Stone and Trey Parkers work. But there are some flaws with this DVD release however. #1 is that the commentery tracks (one of the main reasons I purchased this title given the fact I already had the import)although hilarious when you can hear them seem to be at an extreme low volume compared with the film and gets lost in the mix to the point of being inaudable. Also the inclusion of some of the other extras seems to be unnececary. like the interview with Trey Parker where the sound was failing and all you get is about 15 mins of trey drinking not a smoothie, but a coke as he specifies through loud clanks and static. Also the inclusion of the outakes which are really not that funny and consist of the crew laughing at a few lines then moving on. And last but not least the ""Unrated"" version of this movie is just a title to try and trick people into buying this item, I noticed maybe 3-4 differences in dialog compared with the NC-17 version and that was it and in my oppinion the NC-17 dialog was better so again it seemed unnececary.

1015251,5,6305362998,"Co-Creator of ""South Park"", Trey Parker, plays Joe Young; A Mormon with the Latter Day Saints who is going door-to-door for his church, trying to convert people to his religion, when he stumbles upon the wrong door one day. He knocks on the house of Max Orbison, a man in Hollywood who is a porno director, and doesn't like Joe for disrupting the shoot he is conducting. Orbison attempts to get his henchmen to beat up Joe for his disruption of the shoot, but surprisingly, Joe knows martial-arts, and he is able to defend himself very well. Orbison is so impressed by Joe's moves, that he asks Joe to take over the lead role in his new film. Joe declines his offers to do a porno flick, but Max offers him $20,000 to star in his film, and that would be perfect for him (Joe) and his girlfriend's wedding. An unsure Joe ponders if he should do it or not, but you can already guess he ends up doing it. Along the way, hilarious things happen to the Mormon who is not at all comfortable doing the film, but really needs the money.

Some of the funniest things along the way are the other characters you meet in the movie. Some of them are actual porn stars like Ron Jeremy, and other cast members include the other South Park creator Matt Stone as the hilarious photographer, Dian Bachar (Cannibal The musical, BASEketball) as Orgazmo's sidekick, Chauder Boy. And G-Fresh played by the same guy who was the Indian Chief in Cannibal the musical that plays a funny as hell Asian man who thinks he's a hommie.

Joe thinks no one is ever going to see the film anyway, but little does he know, it becomes one of the biggest box office smashes of all time!! You will have to see the film for yourself to enjoy it as much as I do, and don't worry, I haven't given away spoilers here. The movie is just all around hilarious and one of the best comedy's of all-time.

The movie itself is 5 stars, but I am a little disappointed with the bonus features.
The disc is 2 sided, so it's basically got a second disc as a bonus.

On disc 1 there is 2 versions of the film. The first is the theatrical version. And the second is the reason I pre-ordered this edition when I saw it coming out, the un-cut version. I have to say I am hugely disappointed with it. I thought there would be scenes I had not seen before, or at least spot something new... to be honest, I did not see much of a difference at all! The only difference I noticed was when Joe is talking to the DVDA lady, it has a bit of extended dialog (like, about 5 seconds of it) and I don't know for sure, but the last scene with everyone saying good-bye i don't think was cut that way originally, it seems to be a about 10 seconds longer... but that's it. When I checked the running time, there is about 3 minutes of extended footage in the un-cut version. I really hoped to see deleted scenes put back in or something, but I have to say, again, I hardly noticed a difference at all.

There are 3 audio commentaries to listen to. The first is with Trey, Dion and a bunch of people sitting around laughing, drinking and talking rubbish. Some of it's pretty funny. The second commentary is with a few of the other actors, Andy Kaufman, G-Fresh, A-Cup, and a few of the porno actors... it's ok, but not thrilling. They said Ron Jeremy was supposed to be there, but he was doing the weakest link show. The 3rd one I found too boring for a commentary with the South Park writers and Weird Al Yankovich who had nothing to do with this film.

Extra: Subtitles in English, French, Spanish.
2.0 surround sound.

On disc 2.

There is about 30 minutes of deleted scenes. I can see why a lot of it never made it into the film, it is boring or slow. But, there is one particular continuing thing where one of the guys is told not to do something there, and he cant find a place to 'let go'... they should have kept that in I reckon.

There is a behind the scenes featurette (sort of) of the so-called documentary and interviews for almost an hour of the stars of the film... it's ok for the die-hard fan of Orgazmo who is dieing to see more of the Orgazmo world, but otherwise, it's not something to watch again after the first time.

There are photos from the original idea of the movie, the trailer they shot, and the parody.

There is a 40+ minute out-take reel that I hardly laughed at, at all.

I am pretty disappointed with the extra features, I mean, I just expected too much, like it was going to be hilarious to watch, just like the film, but I guess I got my hopes up too high.

I'd only give the bonus disc 3 stars. It's OK, but it doesn't have anything I will be looking at again and again, over and over.

However, unknown to Joe he would become the Action, Adventure, Porno Star Orgazmo! With his faithful sidekick Choda Boy by his side, he will make the world safe from would be evil doers with his mighty 'Orgazmarator' a ray gun that brings you to a mighty orgasm!

Trey Parker and Matt Stone hit gold with this movie I think, and I'm very glad to see that it's going to be rereleased because at one time, the movie was completely out of print. I caught this movie on cable one late night after suffering from insomnia, and I was just floored with laughter. I laughed so hard, I passed out. This movie is great if you don't mind sexual humor. If you're an uptight person, then maybe you should just pass on this movie.

The acting, the directing, EVERYTHING in this movie was simply brilliant. And you can tell the Co Creators of South Park didn't have a huge budget, however they made it all work perfectly. This movie I think is far superior than just about any big budget comedy I've ever seen. And of course, you have to enjoy the ""Now You're A Man"" theme song that Trey Parker did for this movie...it will leave you in stitches!!",1110412800,18,1356,4.376984126984127
1015259,4,6305362998,"I love South Park, so naturally I wanted to check this out. I loved it!! Anyone who takes this movie seriously completely misses the whole idea. To sit and criticize how they depict Mormons or how they depict the Porn business just has no sense of humor. LIGHTEN UP PEOPLE! It's a great movie to watch if you just want a good laugh after a bad day, or have a bunch of friends over. One of the many things that is so great about Trey Parker and Matt Stone is their ridiculous humor and their complete disregard for the censors. If anyone has seen South Park, be it one episode in passing or a faithful fan, you know that their work ALWAYS pushes just a little past that line. So, in summation, this is the movie for anyone who loves bad taste, stupid humor, and, of course, porn stars.",1110326400,11,784,4.268456375838926

In fact, there's a part of me that wishes that SOUTH PARK wasn't so damn popular. With the guys constantly busy with the show, it has resulted in zero room for more live-action projects like ORGASMO and CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL. Now, a few folks here have knocked ORGASMO for it's cheap production values and special effects, but what they fail to understand is that cheesy look is intentional, it's part of the film's charm. Sure, the guys didn't have a ton of cash to produce this picture, but even if they did, I'd bet that they would still employ that low-budget look for the film to get laughs. Not to spoil the ending, but showing a cheaply built miniature home going up in flames is way funnier than burning a real home or using CGI flame effects. So, relax and enjoy this film for what it is, a very funny and original comedy.",1110326400,9,1019,4.340314136125654
1015373,1,6305362998,"I was living in Utah when this film came out and garnered some controversy for its inaccurate depiction of Mormons.  I didn't get to see it until it was on cable a couple years later and I watched out of curiosity, hoping it would be at least a semi-accurate satire about the Mormon faith.  I was appalled and embarrassed by this poorly made film.  If the creators are going to skewer a religious community for whatever kicks they have...at least do it right!  They got so many of the facts wrong, that they lacked any kind of credibility at all.

One point:  Mormons don't have to pay to have a wedding in one of their temples, so that blew the premise of an LDS Missionary needing money to have his wedding in the ""pricey"" Salt Lake City Temple.  Considering that becoming a porno actor would actually cause the Mormon missionary to be disfellowshipped/excommunicated from his church, he wouldn't be able to have a wedding in any Mormon temple.  If the producer/writer/director couldn't get their fact straight on that one point, the whole premise of the film falls flat.

The acting is horrible, the story is too outlandishly raunchy and non-sensical.  This really is one of the worst films I've ever seen (and I'm not even Mormon!).  I will give this film one bit of credit though...because of its controversy in Utah and the anger it aroused among Mormons for their false portrayal of their faith community, I'm certain that this film launched a Mormon film industry that has tapped into the talents and stories of Mormons all along the Wasatch front.  My advice...skip this movie and watch ""God's Army"", ""The Otherside of Heaven"", ""Singles Ward"", ""The RM"", and most of all, the one must-see Mormon film of all:  ""The Best Two Years"".  In those films, you will find much better stories, better acting, and a more accurate portrayal of Mormons than ""Orgazmo""--a film that only wasted money and celluloid.

**To the individual who keeps voting not helpful, amazon asks you if the review is helpful, not if you agree with the review.  Trust me people, this movie is bad.  If you want to see a film about Mormons and forbidden sex, watch ""Latter Days"".

Parker knows his territory and he delivers a slick script but the only problem is that the really raunchy stuff falters this.

1015527,4,6305362998,"The careers of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creative geniuses behind South Park (the funniest, most daring, satirically sharp-witted television show in history), actually go back farther than many fans are probably aware.  In 1997, not long before South Park premiered and became an instant phenomenon, Trey Parker gave the world a new superhero: Orgazmo.  He wrote, directed, starred in, and even sang the opening song to this film.  Matt Stone puts in a hilarious performance of his own in a relatively minor role, but this is clearly Trey Parker's baby.  Most actors would run screaming from anyone who so much as mentioned the fact they appeared in a film as crude and ridiculous as Orgazmo; Parker, of course, embraces this sort of weird, over-the-top, controversial humor, and his singular daring and utter shamelessness in the interests of making people laugh are the keys to making a movie such as this work so amazingly well.  Naturally, the standard Parker-Stone rules apply, so let it be known that anyone who is easily offended will not enjoy this brand of comedy.  As for the state of Utah, I doubt you can even find a copy of Orgazmo anywhere.
Trey Parker plays Joe Young, a clean-cut Mormon nearing the end of his proscribed time of mission work, looking forward to the day he can leave Los Angeles to return home to his fianc&eacute; and get married in the Mormon Tabernacle - if, that is, he can somehow earn enough money to pay for it.  As luck would have it, an adult movie is being filmed in one of the houses he visits; a bunch of big guys, unappreciative of the spiritual zeal of the Mormon faithful, deal with him rather roughly, and he basically goes Mormon Karate Kid on them.  The director, having seen the fight, insists that Young play the role of the superhero Orgazmo in the film he is shooting.  Young doesn't really want to have anything to do with this type of movie, but he reluctantly agrees to do it for three reasons: 1) he could make enough money to give his fianc&eacute; the wedding she wants, 2) he doesn't think anyone will ever find out (he is a masked hero), and 3) he has a no penetration clause in his contract (there's a double for that).  Well, this stupid adult film about Orgazmo and his sidekick Choda Boy saving gorgeous and very appreciative women from evil (and ugly) bad guys crosses over to mainstream success and becomes one of the highest-grossing films of all time.  There must, of course, be a sequel.  Young finds himself increasingly ensnared in this embarrassing situation that has the potential of costing him his fianc&eacute; and/or landing himself a new role ""sleeping with the fishes, see.""  The bad guys are really bad, even in real life; clearly - need I say it? - this looks like a job for Orgazmo!
Let's talk about the cast.  Parker is great as the nave young Mormon, and it's rather strange to see him portray a character who remains clean-cut and, in a weird sense, pure from start to finish.  Dian Bachar is hilarious as Orgazmo's sidekick and Young's new friend.  Michael Dean Jacobs is perfectly oily and crude as Maxxx Robinson, the adult film director who threatens to ruin Young's life.  Matt Stone steals every scene he is in, but his role should be seen and not discussed (especially since it is sort of hard to describe).  Let us not forget Sancho; what can you say about Sancho except that, well, he is Sancho.  There are also, I should mention, some actual adult film stars in this film - including Ron Jeremy, who is, in my opinion, the most disgusting man to ever live.  Luckily, some of the horror Jeremy inspires is assuaged by the addition of gorgeous starlets such as Juli Ashton, Chasey Lain, and Jill Kelly.  Oddly enough, there is no female nudity in this film at all; the only nudity you get comes in the form of male hinders (and it ain't pretty) - the only thing that can explain the film's NC-17 rating is the barrage of sexual references and sex implements that are on display here.
Make no mistake about it: this is a crude film that many individuals will disapprove of (particularly members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints), but it really doesn't go as far as I expected it to.  Take away a few ""unusual"" outfits, and this thing becomes a rather tame R rated movie.  If you love South Park, you'll appreciate the humor of Orgazmo, but those who cannot stomach our little friends in Colorado would do well to duck and cover if they ever see this movie coming.  I would love to give this film five stars, but I can't: the story's engine loses a cylinder or two before the end, and - more importantly - no movie that makes me have to look at Ron Jeremy will ever get a perfect rating from me.",1080518400,76,4712,4.568883610451306

1015530,5,6305362998,"Orgazmo will never win any awards. It will never teach you anything meaningful about the world or life or mankind's eternal struggle to achieve greatness. It is crude, intolerant and years from now it is definitely not a movie you'll want to share with your kids (at least not while they're young). And yet, it is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
  A movie of decidely more than its constituent parts, Orgazmo is pure comic genius in the inimitable (if critically under-rated) Parker-Stone style. Irreverant is too easy a term to describe it, as it implies a playful distance or better-than-thou attitude with regards to their subject. Anyone who has seen interviews with the terrible twosome will know by now that they aren't just playing at low-brow humor, they're really just pleasantly low-brow (and they would be the first to admit it). And that is a subtle, but meaningful, difference that shows in how they approach their work. The key to both their humor and their appeal is not to be found in insightful wit, catchy phrasing or even a unique perspective (although you will find a surprising amount of all of these things in their work), their secret can be found in dirty, poorly lit apartments and basements the world over. They're just two normal guys. Two normal guys who happen to be really, really funny. They talk like us, they think like us, and you get the feeling from watching movies like Orgazmo or Basketball or Cannibal: The Musical that if they just showed up one night in your own dirty, poorly lit living room and snagged a beer or two, they would fit right in.  You'll recognize them immediately as people you know, but still be amazed at how funny that voice is when played out with reckless abandon and no pride or misplaced ego, on screen. Parker and Stone aren't stupid, quite the opposite you'll find, but they aren't afraid to do or say anything (really...anything) for a laugh and that is honestly refreshing. And really, if you can't laugh at Mormon pornstars, G-Fresh - a thugged out old Japanese guy (one of the highlights of the whole movie), Chasey Lain in a lobster costume or a tiny man in super-hero tights doing ""hamster style"" kung-fu with a dildo strapped to his head, you're trying way too hard to be intellectual.

While going door to door, Joe stumbles upon a house that is filming a porn movie, and Joe accepts a part in the film.

However, if you don't think that's funny, then stay away. That goes double if you actually are a Mormon. While I wouldn't call the film hate-mongering, it's a little mean spirited at times. I give it two stars. One because I laughed a couple of times, and another because that sneaky Trey Parker actually managed to squeeze in a serious message or two about religion and pornography in the middle of all the crude humor.",1015632000,,785,4.567375886524823

Nonetheless, I have to rate this film 4 stars, despite the left side of my brain's adamant protests.

1015739,4,6305362998,"Very outrageous, and yes, undeniably funny film about an innocent, naive Mormon missionary (Parker) who is sent to Los Angeles to spread his church's message, and instead finds himself the star of a pornographic film hit. Filmed prior to ""South Park"" fame, ""Orgazmo"" is a hysterical look inside the pornographic film industry.
After stopping an assault by several henchmen using martial arts skills, Joe Young (Parker) lands himself a job as Orgazmo, a superhero persona who saves sexy women from evil men. The film which pokes fun about everything from Utah to weak film scripts is definitely a change in direction of comedy films from the recent past. With the help of his sidekick Choda Boy (Dian Bachar) Orgazmo suprisingly becomes a major hit with audiences everywhere.
A very funny film from the start, Orgazmo only suffers when crude humor is overwhelmingly used. The running gag of seeing so many sex toys used as weapons wears thin after a while. However, the use of the real Orgazmo ray on the streets of Los Angeles is a riot. Matt Stone, who plays a very hyperactive production assistant is hysterical all throughout the film.
If you are looking a film that is risque and has a no holds barred attitude, than this is the film for you. If you tend to get easily offended by crude humor, then skip this film.",992131200,2,1318,4.759825327510917
1015740,5,6305362998,"Orgazmo is truly one of the funniest motion pictures I've ever seen.  Trey Parker directs and stars as Joe Young, a Mormon missionary who inadvertently winds up being cast in an adult film as Orgazmo, an erotic superhero.  Dian Bachar plays an MIT graduate cast as his sidekick, Choda Boy.  Matt Stone plays an overenthusiastic production assistant similar to the ""Scotty"" role played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in ""Boogie Nights"".  Real life porn stars Ron Jeremy, Chasey Lain, and my all-time favorite, Juli Ashton, also appear.
Although ""Orgazmo"" is certainly a risque movie, I find myself agreeing with one reviewer who pondered the fact that it received an NC-17 rating despite having only a very brief amount of nudity and only moderate use of adult language.  Rating notwithstanding, the movie is simply hilarious.  Parker, despite his reputation, is very believable as a naive young man drawn into a very tawdry occupation.  The rest of the cast is quite credible, and the movie's theme song (written by Parker) had me falling out of my chair laughing.
This picture obviously won't be for everyone.  Those who are thin-skinned enough to be offended by ""South Park"", and those really hung up on religion should avoid this one like the plague.  Nevertheless there are reviews from people of that sort here, which leads me to conclude that they just wanted to vent their indignation over something they probably never watched in the first place but would like to keep you from seeing.

We saw a new kind of humor, one that may be cheesy, it may be stupid, but it sure is funny and it sure is original. I've had a ton of south park stuff since then, got my DVD of BASEketball, another must have, the South Park movie. But i didn't have this one due to the rating it's not really carried, but i have a friend who has Cinemax so luckily he taped the movie for me. It was just as good as i expected, though it looks like it was made with about $50 and stuff borrowed from a friend.
For 90 minutes i was completely engrossed to my television. I could not leave until this hilarious picture was over. The lines in this film are absolutely great, this is just the type of shameless guy fun movie that you'll always be using lines from with your friends. Such as Matt Stone's classic
""I don't mean to sound like a queer or nothing but....""
you get what i mean, there's a ton of great lines in this pictures.
The characters are awesome in this movie. They made the characters really animated. The way they brought the Mormon into the ""Industry"" was just absolutely hilarious. The characters were in fact so good, they even made a TV show that definitely takes after this called Strip Mall, the people who make that show know that they took a lot of stuff from this movie. Also you learn the root of Trey Parker's band DVDA's name, and you will laugh like a madman when you hear it.
The movie is absolutely great, Trey Parker is a script writing genius. The only things i am disappointed about is,
1) Due to Trey's hate of movie studios only caring for money which is parodized in the film, he will not be making any more movies, hence, no Orgazmo 2.
2) There is no DVD for this movie, what a shame. It would have the best commentary and deleted scenes ever. The extras on this would be fantastic, and the audio on my copy of this video is total garbage.
3) The NC-17....there's about an eighth of a second of nudity in the film, sure the dialogue is a little racy and they show some sex toys but so what. It's just a little more of what you'd see in any R rated film. As if the dose of foul language is going to make a film any worse for you. You never see people actually engaged in...well...you know....you just see flying legs and arms in the air...it's pretty funny stuff.
This movie is a must have for anybody, but if you're not a big Trey Parker fanatic go rent the tape and wait for the DVD release of this classic",981676800,3,2595,4.202404809619239
1015856,3,6305362998,"Trey Parker -- the auteur behind 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' -- unsheathes his sword of parody (what did you think he was going to unsheathe?) for 'Orgazmo'.  Unfortunately, the blade is somewhat dull this time around.
Yes, he ably skewers the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, depicting its members as earnest simpletons with absolutely no sense of the world outside of Utah.  And he skewers the porno industry, depicting its practitioners as earnest simpletons with absolutely no sense of the world outside of Los Angeles.  Parker's audience perceives these organizations as silly anyway, making them an ineffective target for his parody.  Frankly, I think the most direct hit is taken by comic book movies.  Witness the animated depiction of Orgazmo seen under the opening credits (accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek metal song, with the most intentionally stupid lyrics ever heard by these ears).
What makes the movie effective (when it is effective, and it does have its moments) are the deadpan performance given by its actors.  Dian Bachar (""Chodo Boy""!) never camps up his kung fu sidekick role, even though he had ample opportunity to.  He is the better for it.  Robin Lynne Raab is quite sweet as Orgazmo's betrothed.  They're love is --if a bit nave -- very believable in its purity.  Even porno legend Ron Jeremy tones himself down.  Even though he is not given enough to create a complete character, it's nice to see him give it the old 'legitimate' try.  And Parker himself is lovably dim, taking serious his dilemma of whether or not to accept $20,000 to appear in a porno movie just so his fiancee can have her wedding in a fancy Mormon temple back home.
The movie falls off the rails when its actors can't resist the urge to play things big.  David Dunn plays Orgazmo's rival, A-Cup, way over the top.  I was worried that this unknown actor would bust a vein in his forehead, his intensity was so high.  Michael Dean Jacobs, as the porno-mogul who recruits young Joe Young, does little more with his part than grease his hair back, expose his chest hair, wear tacky clothing, and yell.  And Parker's 'South Park' cohort Matt Stone is a collection of annoying tics under a hideous wig, and his catchphrase (""I don't want to sound like a queer or nothin'"") gets tiresome after hearing it a dozen or so times.
There are some truly inspired moments, like the ""DVDA Lady"" (I'm not going to even try to explain that acronym here!) or a cameo by Jesus himself, during which laughter is inevitable.  And the campiness of the whole endeavor is actually quite endearing.  It just never lived up to the expectations created by the 'South Park'.  That movie proved that if given enough time and resources, Parker can be a truly inspired satirist.  Here, he settles for blunted parody, and the movie is the worse off for it.",974592000,5,2849,4.775510204081633

1016081,5,6305362998,"If you are a fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone then you will love yet another comic creation from them, well from Trey mostly, this movie had comedy, lust, love, and some awesome karate.  This movie definately did not  need the NC-17 rating though,I have seen R rated movies that were alot  worse, I recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good laugh and alot of  cheesy humor!!",933552000,,382,4.414285714285715
1016169,4,6305362998,"Orgazmo is a very sharp but never cynical satire of Mormonism and the porno industry (with the occasional jab at LA culture and comic-book superheroes).  It's notable that Parker manages to spoof both subjects  without demonizing one or both, especially two such antagonistic subjects.  The Mormon missionary Joe Young (a conflation of Mormon establishing  figures Joseph Smith and Brigham Young?) is written and played by Parker as  a sincere adherent to his faith, even sharing the restored gospel with his  costars between scenes (Parker appears to have a fairly good working  knowledge of the LDS church; however, Mormons don't pray before statues),  Likewise, the porno actors are shown as likable people who can go out for  sushi dinner together after a day's shooting.  The bad guys are the men  pulling the strings--the Mormon hierarchy who set prices for a temple  wedding out of reach of the average couple and the sleazy porno producer  who cares only for profits, pleasure and the expansion of his erotic  empire.  Orgazmo is a consistently hilarious film with very likable  characters. Reminiscent in many ways of Steve Buscemi's great but  overlooked ""Living In Oblivion."" Keep an eye out for real-life  porno veteran Ron Jeremy. Parker stands to become Generation X's Woody  Allen--a very talented writer, director and actor. A highly recommended  film sure to attract a dedicated following as word of it gets out.",929750400,,1429,5.157205240174672

ChodaBoy is the coolest character ever. Just the way he  says his name. It's awesome. This movie isn't for people who can't take a  joke with a light- heart. If you like BASEketball, you'll love this movie.  I saw it 2 times in the theater. Absolutely hilarious. A must see.",924480000,,437,4.117647058823529
1016171,5,6305362998,"They say that a million dollar budget is low budget, hey, it's more money than I'll ever have.  Trey Parker (of South Park fame) wrote, directed and stars as Joseph Young, a mormon who turns porn star to get money to marry  his sweetheart in Utah.  This movie was rated NC-17 and it shouldn't have.  Saving Private Ryan had more violence and language, and it got the R  rating.  Orgazmo had NO NUDITY,NO SEX (just before & after), slapstick  violence and just a bunch of f-words.  Trey Parker went in and cut a whole  bunch of scenes, and it still got NC-17.  C'mon!!  Because of this, Orgazmo  didn't get the play it deserved.  This is a great comedy.",923788800,,652,4.423728813559322
