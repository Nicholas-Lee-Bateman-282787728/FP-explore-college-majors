8003014,5,1612616542,"This totally unique DVD is enjoyable and enriching on so many levels. it explores 6 different responses over the centuries to the call of Christ to follow Him. each response results in a rich Christian spiritual tradition which has not only survived the test of time but impacted in very positive ways human history, culture, science, philosophy. Fr Albert Haase explores the milieu in which each tradition arose and the personalities of the early Fathers and Mothers of Christianity responsible for initiating the movement. the viewer is entranced by the magnificent geography of the origins of these spiritualities and gets to see some of the original structures and monasteries where the traditions evolved. Fr. Haase carefully enumerates how these traditions- Benedictine, Cistercian, Carmelite. Dominican, Franciscan, Jesuits- differ from each other and how each illustrates a beautiful  way to answer the call to follow Jesus. incorporated in each section is a study of some of the ""greats"" from each tradition including St Thomas Aquinas, St. John of the Cross, St Theresa of Avila. Thomas Merton, St Francis of Assisi among many others. this DVD series so excited the members of my bible study that several members are ordering their own personal copy. it is the type of study you will want to see again and again. as a Catholic it is particularly enjoyable as Pope Francis has declared this the year of appreciation of consecrated life [monks, nuns etc] but I think all Christian would love this DVD because it reviews their history as well- this is CHRISTIAN spirituality, not owned solely by Catholics. [much of the origins of these traditions predate the Reformation.]  in summary, I would say GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS DVD. it will enrich your walk with the Lord.",1429228800,,1773,5.068493150684931
