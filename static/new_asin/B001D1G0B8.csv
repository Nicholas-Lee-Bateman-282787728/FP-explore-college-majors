8290932,3,B001D1G0B8,"I really wanted to like this movie, which is probably why I did.  By now, I have been a fan of the TouchTone Terrorist/Junkyard Willie prank call CD's for 14 years.  Throughout the early- and mid-2000's, the series' creator had been promoting this movie on his website.  After years of excitement and anticipation, ""Lost in Transit"" seemed like it would never be finished.  When it was finally released, I was disappointed.  I still love the comedic genius and the novel approach behind the TouchTone Terrorist's work.  Unfortunately the low-brow humor, zany characters, and surreal plotlines of the prank calls do not translate well to the big screen.

True appreciation of any movie would require the willing suspension of disbelief.  The prank calls work beautifully in allowing for this.  Although the calls themselves present absurd and impossible circumstances, they only contain audio, which effectively causes the listener to visualize the scene internally.  As unbelievable as the situations may be, each call has a live audience BELIEVING the situation in some regard.  Therefore, it is much easier to suspend disbelief while listening to the prank calls rather than watching their film adaptation.

Fans of the prank call CD's will appreciate at least some of the movie's merits.  The actor portraying Junkyard Willie is spot on.  He has the perfect look, mannerisms, and speech patterns.  Pete Dzhogi, the director, made the right choice when he dubbed over the actor's voice with his own (Dzhogi also created and voiced Willie in the original prank calls).  The end result is the perfect visual representation of the Junkyard Willie character from the CD's:  an angry, booming, gravelly-voiced, Fred Sanford-like character with a take-no-guff attitude.  His trusty sidekick JimBob--a crippled, slow-witted hillbilly portrayed by Dzhogi himself--is also effectively brought to life and worthy of a few chuckles.  In one sequence the duo are mercilessly scammed out of thousands of dollars (which they stole from packages in the mailroom) at a strip club and a high-end hotel.

The drunken-piloting scene has some laugh potential.  One memorable sight gag involves Blade and Willie rolling down an airplane window using a crank handle from a car door so they can ""drop off"" a customer's package.  When they discover a crate containing an illegal immigrant child, however, Blade's poor acting ruins the comedic potential.  The poorly-rendered CGI shot of the airplane in the sky is pitiful, unnecessary, and detrimental to the entire scene.  The overall production value of the movie is decent up until this point.

Regrettably, the characters and stories don't lend themselves well to the visual medium.  Put simply, they are too far-fetched.  The idea of a mailroom full of misfits is funny enough on its own, but the movie's subplots detract from the main story.  It is too difficult to imagine Junkyard Willie--the lowest common denominator of a crass, uneducated, middle-aged black man--becoming a pilot, a gynecologist, and a lawyer within the course of a 90-minute movie.  Blade, the burned-out rocker character, is poorly portrayed.  It's easy enough to imagine a drug- and booze-fueled 80's metalhead vandalizing postal parcels and stealing a cop car, but the actor does not sell the character at all.  JimBob has a promising subplot involving an evangelical church and a wheelchair boxing match, but it's just not that funny.  While the prank call CD's had me rolling on the floor laughing, the movie just had me rolling my eyes.  The jokes have been ""Lost In Transit"" from the audio realm to the visual one.

Another reviewer commented that with its very loosely-structured plot, Lost in Transit comes off as a series of bad SNL skits strung together.  Perhaps it would've been more effective as a sketch-comedy series than a feature-length film.  The characters and stories are funny in themselves, but they don't mesh well together.

I would've been curious to see some of the minor characters from the older CD's (i.e. Old Man Louie, Clarence Washington, and Stu Jaimison) portrayed on film; but they are nowhere to be found here.  That's a shame, as they could have been very entertaining and somewhat believable.

All criticism aside, I still enjoyed the movie.  It was worth the 8 bucks I paid for the DVD.  I watched it twice, had a few laughs, and may even watch it again one day.  I lent it out to three of my friends--all TTT fans themselves.  Only one of these three friends was able to sit through the entire movie.

Pete Dzhogi's movie was a self-produced labor of love intended for a niche audience.  Sadly, it will only captivate a small part of an already-small market.",1411430400,,4706,5.078226857887874
8290933,5,B001D1G0B8,"Fine, okay, I'm exaggerating in the title just a little.  I've been a fan of the Touch Tone Terrorists for more than 10 years now.  Most of their prank calls are brilliant and, just like the Jerky Boys, RePete created some awesome, lovable characters in his calls - Blade, Willie and JimBob.  I was excited to see the movie and watched it with a few friends this week.  I was only slightly let down, as I wasn't expecting much from it.

It was a fun movie to watch and I will definitely be watching it again, but probably never again while I'm completely sober.  The production seemed flawless.  I was constantly amazed with the professional looking sets and props.  For a low budget film, it seems like they spared no expense making this movie look great.  Every line of the main character's voice was dubbed over and I didn't notice a single discrepancy with the mouth/voice, which was impressive too.

The acting was what I expected.  The 3 main characters did an excellent job on their parts, but all the extras were pretty awful.  And there were a lot of extras, most of them seeming to be plucked from the sketchiest strip clubs available.

The movie's main problem was the plot.  It started out promising as a movie about a bunch of shipping company employees doing wacky things, but eventually went all over the place with each character having their own crazy set of misadventures.  It was all fun to watch and I admit that I laughed a lot, but after awhile it seemed like it was just a bunch of bad SNL skits all strung together that would never end.  I know it's stupid to complain about the plot in a movie like this, but I'm doing it anyway.

All in all, it was a fun movie and I'm sure I'll see it again.  I can't imagine anyone who's not into the Touch Tone Terrorist prank calls ""getting"" this movie, so be sure to at least go to the TTT website and listen to all the hilarious prank calls clips.  If the prank calls make you laugh, then you should be able to appreciate most of the humor in this movie too.",1294099200,4,2023,4.375335120643432
8290934,1,B001D1G0B8,I actually fell asleep on this one. It had no story line at all. Just a poor product all around.,1287187200,2,96,3.85
8290935,3,B001D1G0B8,"I love the Touchtone Terrorists but the movie, I thought was not as good as I expected. Not like the phone calls to much.",1277510400,,121,4.083333333333333
8290936,4,B001D1G0B8,"I would recommend this movie to folks who like art house indie, sophomoric, college humor or people who just can't get enough of the Touchtone Terrorists, as I can't.  Without spoiling it, the movie is sort of like a series of setups and punchlines with familiar themes from the TTT prank calls throughout. This is no million dollar production but then I doubt Junkyard Willie and Jim Bob are the kind of status quo that DreamWorks would ever want to be associated with either.",1228348800,5,477,4.678571428571429
