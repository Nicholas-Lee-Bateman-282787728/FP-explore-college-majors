Grant you the inexperience of the interviewer might distract you, but try to go beyond that, and listen to the experience and dedication of all the professional people who were interviewed.  This information alone is worth the investment.

This is a rare opportunity for children and adults to gain equestrian insight.",1194998400,,473,5.116883116883117
7794048,1,0967797616,"...but not much good info here.

Poorly-written narration, off-the-cuff interviews by dorky announcer, single-camera footage (and very poor lighting). Poor editing. No introduction, and the DVD menu is faulty and incomplete (""blank"" points where you can click and start it up, but nothing shows up in the menu until the next frame).

FAR too much footage on dogs!!! Repetitive!!! Far too LITTLE footage on the show rounds at the end - the part that would have been most interesting! Does not even show all eight finalists.

The vet was intelligent and provided some useful info. Far too little info given on show scoring and description of events (they don't explain anything about the dressage movements) - but too much on the ""style"" of jumps. I mean the actual wood jumps - ""Here we have a jump shaped like a giraffe, here we have a wavy jump...""

Just not well-balanced at all. Probably good for a 7-12 year-old horse fanatic, but little here for an adult.

And *really* bad filmwork...",1099008000,28,990,4.834319526627219
