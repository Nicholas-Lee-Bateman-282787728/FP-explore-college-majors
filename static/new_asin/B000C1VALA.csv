8095083,2,B000C1VALA,"This item is of limited value to all but the most novice of players. Even then it doesn't help that much. In example, it spends approx 10 seconds on the grip, showing the three different styles, but not how to actually grip the club. I had bought this to help friends get started with golf, but doubt it will be of any use. This is more of an overview of golf.
On the positive side, it does have some very basic info on etiquette and rules, but again very limited. There are some tips that were helpful, in that they reminded me of what I already knew.",1211587200,,552,4.168224299065421
