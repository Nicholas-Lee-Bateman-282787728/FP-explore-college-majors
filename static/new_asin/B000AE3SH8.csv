8078244,4,B000AE3SH8,"This 1990 show, recorded in Nottingham, England, has Saxon performing a very strong performance. It is almost an intimate show, the audience is not very big, but the band (here with the line-up of Byford, Oliver, Quinn, Carter and Glockler)rocks hard as ever and, except if they are the best actors in the world, they seem to really be enjoying themselves, to be having a great time.

Due to the cheap covert art and packaging, and also because this DVD release features an old performance, I had doubts about the quality. But I was pleasantly surprised, it's a very good show. (however, I warn you that there are absolutely no extras).",1137024000,,636,4.72972972972973
