2229391,5,B0007PALH0,"Shirley Temple's 'Curly Top' is a perfect demonstration of the young actress's remarkable talent.  I can't think of any child star, now or then, who could carry an entire film the way she did every year in the 1930's.  She is completely unrivaled.

In this film she plays Elizabeth Blair, a sweetly precocious orphan who, along with her older sister Mary, is adopted by a kind-hearted wealthy businessman.  The musical numbers are absolutely classic, and include the famous ""Animal Crackers In My Soup"" in which she leads her fellow orphans in a dining room singalong.  Then there's the ultra-adorable song n' dance (and jump-rope) number ""When I Grow Up"", where we get to see little Shirley dress up in various costumes that include a wedding gown and an old lady getup, grey hair and all.  Last but not least, Shirley does one of her most famous tapdance numbers on top of a white grand piano in the aptly-titled song ""Curly Top"".

The seasoned supporting cast definitely shines as well.  John Boles is extremely charming as Edward Morgan, the handsome millionaire who takes in the orphaned sisters, although his piano-accompanied operatic singing can seem a little tedious, especially to younger viewers.

One of my favorite actors, Arthur Treacher, expertly plays the quietly sarcastic butler whose stiff exterior quickly melts after befriending young Elizabeth.  Treacher is better known for his role in the later Shirley Temple film, The Little Princess, in which he plays the cruel schoolmaster's flamboyant brother, Mr Birdy.

Filled with interesting characters and situations, Curly Top is such a delightful movie.  I've seen it over fifty times since first watching it at the age of ten.  It's got musical numbers, romance, drama, and comedy, all wrapped up in a cute little package.  It's a must-have for Shirley Temple fans, and classic movie fans in general.",1125705600,9,1871,5.071895424836601
2229392,5,B0007PALH0,"Not only is Shirley Temple an amazing actress but she is so adorable I love this heartwarming movie, of a young girl who plays cupid and brings her older sister and friend together. Her sweet and cute songs bring instant happiness to everyone who watches. The movie is a mix of comedy, romance and can be enjoyed by the whole family. This would definetly have to be one of my favourite Shirley Temple movies. If you want real entertainment then please watch and enjoy CURLY TOP!",1114560000,3,478,4.569767441860465
2229393,4,B0007PALH0,"CURLY TOP is a musical version of Jean Webster's ""Daddy Long Legs"", about a young orphan who is mysteriously sponsored by a never-named benefactor.

Shirley Temple and Rochelle Hudson play Elizabeth and Mary Blair, two orphans who are sponsored by Edward Morgan (John Boles) who uses the alias of 'Hireman Jones'.  Complications arise when Edward falls in love with Mary but of course he cannot reveal his true identity.  It's up to little Elizabeth to play matchmaker!

Jane Darwell, Esther Dale, Arthur Treacher and Rafaela Ottiano round out the supporting cast.  Temple sings the classic ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"".  A real charmer.",1113091200,10,637,5.135922330097087
