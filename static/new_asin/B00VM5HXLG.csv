7094240,5,B00VM5HXLG,Fun film with some good scares!,1431907200,,31,4.333333333333333
7094241,1,B00VM5HXLG,"This one's even worse than Grave Encounters. Very polished, slickly edited, and obviously with a low budget, but not a microbudget. That, and it's got Lance Hendrickson. You'd think all those factors would combine to make a decent b-horror video, but nope.

The plot is so overworn and overdone, I'd seen this movie a hundred times before.

The primary failing is really, really bad acting. Funny thing was, even Lance turned in a quickie, poor performance. I hate even saying that, as I dig LH, but this just comes across as something he shot in an hour as he passed by the set.

No scares, terrible acting, really bad script, and really, really bad acting, if I didn't mention that. Definitely don't rent this one. Wait for Netflix or Amazon Prime, as it will be there soon enough after this initial release run.",1431820800,5,814,4.678321678321678
7094242,5,B00VM5HXLG,"Hollow's Grove really brings something new to the table. This film plays with horror movie tropes and stereotypes, instead of just succumbing to them. It's almost satirical in some spots. It's also got good character development, great sound design, some genuine scares, and LANCE HENRIKSEN! If you're in the mood for a fun, Friday night fright flick that's got some brains to it, check this one out.",1431648000,7,400,4.985074626865671
7094243,3,B00VM5HXLG,"Just a fairly good horror story, one that we see a lot, about a haunted asylum, or hospital, and the operator of an annoying camera recording what his friends find in this spooky place. Oh, well, the acting wasn't too bad and the plot expanded into some real scary stuff. The crew, with the exception of a few, were big shots wanting fame and fortune. There were some terrible things done to children many years ago. The truth hurts, and can kill.",1431561600,2,447,4.463414634146342
7094244,3,B00VM5HXLG,"I liked the plot of investigators having a show that they were faking & then going into a place that they didn't expect to really be haunted. The film quality was good,the acting was pretty good,but to me the scares were minimal & predictable. Something was just missing in it for me. I enjoyed it,but just saying it needed something extra.",1431561600,7,340,4.590163934426229
7094245,4,B00VM5HXLG,"I enjoyed Hollowsgrove. I thought it was a solid effort and had some great scares on it. The effects were pretty good but what really sells the movie is the sound. Do yourself a favor and wear headphones while you watch or better yet, put it on surround sound and turn up the volume!

This is a great movie to enjoy with friends, it's not attempting to reinvent horror but does its job as a kick back and have some pop corn type flick very well.",1431388800,15,445,4.174418604651163
7094246,5,B00VM5HXLG,"Awesome ""found footage"" film!!  Loved it though I could have done without the FBI opening/closing scene -  giving this 5 stars!!",1499126400,,128,5.0476190476190474
7094247,5,B00VM5HXLG,This is a great movie!  Very creepy found footage film.,1498953600,,55,4.5
7094248,5,B00VM5HXLG,"I thought this was an excellent movie!!  Much better than the regular found footage, as it's filmed mostly in 3rd person (you'll understand why if you watch it.)

I'm not going to give anything away that wasn't already in the preview or description, so here goes:  Before the actual action starts, it's actually a lot of fun to watch them totally rip on the actual ""ghost shows"" that are on TV. There were a lot of times I smiled, because I could see the overacting / drama they were putting on for ""their"" show, as opposed to the ""reality"" of the 3rd person. The writer really gave it to the ghost shows, and I liked it.

As you would expect, the action starts slowly and builds to a climax before the movie ends -- but it's good. Real good. Not over the top, not a LOT of CGI, but a whole lot of mood and atmosphere.

I enjoyed it, and I think you will too.",1495843200,3,859,4.181818181818182
7094249,1,B00VM5HXLG,"Abysmal acting, terrible dialog, and blatantly contrived scares make this entire mess not worth watching.  Sooooo bad.",1495843200,,118,5.9411764705882355
7094250,5,B00VM5HXLG,"I personally love this movie. I have watched it several times.  I love horror, thriller, mystery movies. This was definitely creepy my first time watching it. I think this is definitely worth watching. It is one of my favorite asylum & ghost movies.

If you decide that you like this one, I also recommend grave encounters 2, chasing the devil, and Pet.",1492041600,2,353,4.67741935483871

7094253,4,B00VM5HXLG,"Not exactly like new, but it plays well and I am glad to have it.  Thanks",1490054400,2,73,3.5625
7094254,1,B00VM5HXLG,Stupid. Even by 'found footage' standards it is stupid. Don't expect to see a lot of Mykelti Williamson. He makes an appearance but that is about it. The 'scary ghost' is supposed to be 7 years of age yet is about 6 foot tall.,1489795200,,226,4.159090909090909
7094255,2,B00VM5HXLG,"This started off okay but then it devolved into just another ""found footage"", running with the jiggly camera, everyone screaming crap that I blame Blair Witch for starting. Deep sigh.
Also, it normally helps if there is a character I can root for. One character with redeeming qualities. I really couldn't find one. What I did find was myself, rooting for each one to be picked off. And that's just sad.",1489708800,,403,4.690140845070423
7094256,3,B00VM5HXLG,"Its not bad... its not great... but its not bad. I was in the mood for something ghosty and I didn't feel this was a waste of time, as I do with many, many  horror movies these days. I gotta tell ya that the one ghost you DO actually get a good look at is CREEPY as hell. One of the creepiest I've seen in a very long time. The acting is OK (but they kinda try too hard). The special effects are actually pretty good. All in all if you're in the mood for something scary, I wouldn't pass it up.",1488844800,3,494,3.843137254901961
7094257,4,B00VM5HXLG,"Surprisingly good!  The actors seemed quite natural and it gave me chills, in the same way Blair Witch did.

Like another reviewer says, the FBI bits at the beginning and end should have been cut.  They add nothing to the story and do not seem realistic.",1487721600,2,254,4.478260869565218
7094258,3,B00VM5HXLG,"The FBI skit in the beginning, and very end of this movie belongs on the cutting room floor; to say it was amateurish, & inept is an understatement in observation, frankly it was so bad the floundering performance almost succeeds in swindling the other actors from redeeming this project altogether, however they did in fact rescue the film unto a 3 star, as opposed to a knee jerk 1 or 2 star impulsive action  - This film may have very well warranted a four star, or due to the 'scare' values of the script and sound which bled seamlessly; maybe even a 5 -

There are three actors which stand out:

First: (Bresha Webb) who was very comfortable, & believable in her role as the manager/den mother character Presiding over the unruly, immature & improperly behaved team members, all the way unto the dramatic change of her character's persona.

Second: (Sunkrish Bala) - I was most impressed with his ability to pull off multiple characters within his character.. moving effortlessly from the annoying, brassy main character's format, to the ghost hunter in front of the camera before a television audience, & finely unto the Grand Finale of a frightened man facing the malevolent unknown

Third: (Matthew Carey) - Skillful, yet Subtle behind the camera acting which managed to bring his character before the audience; with very little visual appearances.",1487376000,,1356,4.903930131004367

7094264,1,B00VM5HXLG,"One of the worst found footage films ever. Characters that are completely unlikable (immature, sexist, homophobic, stupid, and rude) as well as badly acted coupled with AWFUL writing, insipid humor, ridiculous effects plus stealing bits from other, far better horror films make this an absolute waste of time.",1485993600,,309,5.458333333333333

7094269,5,B00VM5HXLG,"Wasn't expecting much from this film, but it was really well done.  Had some great scares that were not of the jump/start variety.  Whoops!  What does the ghost hunter types do when they usually set up 'video evidence' and the place does it for them - really being haunted?!  The acting was professional in that it didn't look like they were 'acting' as in a high school play, it looked like it was really happening to the characters.  Good job!",1484524800,,445,4.5125

7094275,2,B00VM5HXLG,"A poor substitute for Grave Encounters. The tone of the film was all over the place with too many dick jokes and acting that was way too over-the-top, even while they were lampooning Ghost Adventures. They leaned too much on tropes and brought nothing new to the table. The addition of Lance Henriksen was pointless and not worth the money they likely spent for his name.",1480032000,2,371,4.636363636363637

7094281,4,B00VM5HXLG,"While Hollows Grove isn't a revolutionary film as far as the found footage and ghost haunting genre goes, it seperates itself from other movies by being well paced and having decent cinematography. It's a fairly generic story, but does a well job of telling it without becoming boring or tedious. I really appreciated the fact the film did not rely heavily on night vision shots, as is so common with these types of films.

The acting wasn't top notch, but it wasn't horrible either. There are some cute, even funny moments in the film that made me laugh, but it was just enough to keep it dark and suspenseful without treading into out right comedy terrority.

Frankly, I found this film better than others such as Grave Encounter.",1475366400,3,732,4.7109375

I could have also gone without the intro and exit clips, they seemed somewhat unnecessary--almost like the writer couldn't think of a beginning or end.  The ghosts were pretty well done, creepy.  No major jump factors, at least not for me.  Might be a fun movie for a teenage sleep over.",1471910400,,471,4.63855421686747

7094287,4,B00VM5HXLG,I thought it was worth watching. Creepy! Made me jump a few times.,1469664000,,66,4.153846153846154
7094288,4,B00VM5HXLG,This movie reminded me of Grave Encounters (which I really enjoyed) and I think I liked the characters more from Grave Encounters. This one was pretty creepy too and I loved watching it. I would only recommend they didn't goof off so much in the first 15 minutes-It was irritating to sit through.,1467763200,,296,4.60377358490566

7094309,3,B00VM5HXLG,"It hurts me to give it three stars, but it wasn't completely terrible. In the first minute of the film you are told that you are viewing this to help the federal investigation unit or something, that sleeze cheese in itself almost made me turn it off. It felt like an attempt at a homage to Ed Wood, but a failure.
The characters aren't likeable, at least the ones you spend the most time with aren't. Sorry, but it's true, if characters are going to be killed off, i want to at least feel a bit emotionally attached/or something. Instead they were annoying caricatures of those kids from highschool that were total jerks, grown up, to remain the same.
Julie is worth watching, she is the producer, keeps them in line and tells the history of the building, while Main Annoying (Tim) makes horrible jokes. Bill played by Lance Henriksen (how did they get him? i don't know...) , is pretty cool, he does the horror gags on their phony ghost show, he is interesting but given a tiny bit of screen time.
Sigh.
It follows all the usual found film footsteps. What sets it apart for me is the orphanage, while there are tons of them, it's hard to find some that give a history, sure it's fake, but it makes it somewhat interesting.

If you are bored and easily scared, you might like this. I'm just bored, and it didn't completely bore me.
It's better than most PRIME found horror choices, so there's that.

It's like he has a favorite nephew in the film industry and was helping him shoot this completely scary FFF. The actors were perfect at being cheesy exploitative B-movie people and then ramping up the fear factor as ""things"" progressed. I'm a seasoned horror film watcher and am writing a book of fantasy/horror, this movie kept my attention and had me jump and cringe at just he right spots. That fact that they thought it was their friend Bill doing the ghost tricks almost all the way through was really good, because the audience knows better. The only thing weird were the ghost children. Not good cg but by that time you're scared enough to buy it. Clown ghost girl? Nah but like I said before.

Quite enjoyable, and even though they gave Mykelti Williamson top billing, don't believe, he was barely in it, and wasn't even actually in the story.

There's alway the same group: a cynic who doesn't really believe, but who just wants to make a buck; an experienced member who knows more than he is saying; a complete wimp who should never have taken the job in the first place, and who freaks at every little thing that happens; and a ""psychic"" who thinks she knows what's going on, but who isn't as bright as one would think.

7094333,4,B00VM5HXLG,"This is FBI case file B 4785 and we the audience are helping them solve this case of found footage, a claim made less convincing by using Lance  Henriksen in the film and having a credit roll. But just go with it. Harold Maxwell (Matthew Carey)  recently dumped by his girlfriend (useless plot point) is allowed to film behind the scenes of a paranormal investigation group known as S.P.I.T. and are in their 5th season. Early on they film Bill (Lance Henriksen) who sets up the filming location with fake scares. When our crew arrives at the second most haunted place in America (the first one has been overdone) they believe all the scary stuff that is happening has been staged by Bill, something that sets this production apart. Hollows Grove was an overcrowded orphanage with the proverbial crematorium in the basement and crazy kid on the upper floor.

Many of the gags we have seen done before and were slightly boring, if if they did it a little better. The creep factor was good. The internal conflict in the group was poorly scripted and could have been better, especially the obscene signs and fart humor. The really good scare scene (photo on back cover and sell point of the film) was short lived and not repeated.

The very end of the film reminded me of an Internet gag and wasn't as effective as my black cat jumping on my lap with 20 minutes left in the film...about the time things go super critical. In spite of the short comings, I did enjoy the film. The hand held camera aspect wasn't bad.

7094346,4,B00VM5HXLG,"This is a better than average riff on 'ghost hunter TV show finds the real thing', Grave Encounters being the benchmark. The neat thing with this one is that they're playing with the tropes that we all know are coming (creepy noises, shadows moving in the background, stuff falling over): The team has a valid (wrong, but normally valid) reason to explain away the weird stuff that starts happening about 5 minutes after they walk in - their FX man 'Bill' sets up everything ahead of time, and they're used to being scared s***less in old creepy buildings. In my opinion this actually makes the team seem less bine-headed than you might think: they have an explanation for things going bump in the big creaky orphanage...It's wrong, but the repeated brush-offs of the weird stuff come across as 'yeah I'd do that' than 'OMG you idiot'.

I'd rate this a 'medium' on the proverbial scare scale. The atmosphere is creepy, but I've seen creepier, and there are some good 'gotcha!' moments, images (creepy dolls are creepy, especially with no eyes) and jump scares, as well as a very sad backstory and some good ideas. They could have taken it further, but it was still quite entertaining.

I think the main reason I enjoyed this is because the cast had some very solid chemistry. The team actors obviously really got along, and were clearly having fun - it really came across as a group of buddies doing a project with a lot of enthusiasm - it made everyone quite likeable.

So 'Hollows Grove' is a solid indie horror effort with a good cast and good ideas. The execution could have been a bit tighter, but there were clearly budget constraints, and I still enjoyed the movie.

We love horror movies but especially this new genre of takes on reality ghost shows where investigators head into various locations and give you a history of what happened there as well as their investigation. I am not going to lie; I am a big fan of these types of shows.

In Hollows Grove a bunch a paranormal investigation team explore an abandoned, haunted orphanage.  It takes a while before the ""real"" ghosts show up (midway through the movie). Before that the team are setting up their shots and scaring each other.

I definitely jump twice but shook about 5 times and I think that was because of the audio. There was a lot of whispering or low talking and suddenly there would be the loudest sound.

The effects of the ""ghost children"" were fair but part of me wishes there was more interaction.

is blatantly happening behind the backs of said cast. They stumble through this Supposedly frightful building where the ""real deal"" is occurring, (as spoken by the caretaker), not taken seriously, and grossly overwhelming acts are scoffed at by the crew, making themselves victims for the slaughter. The funniest part is the ""F.B.I."" inspector who ushers you in to watch, and then post F.F. to see the last ghost apparition.

But I ended up liking this movie a lot. I liked the characters that made up the SPIT crew. They were written as average Joes who didn't necessarily believe in what they were shooting, but wanted to make a few bucks and have some fun along the way. Fun loving guys and a girl that just like to crack jokes about each other and just general kidding around. Then they hit the hospital for the shoot. They still bust each others chops bust somehow gets some work done. For effect, they have a guy named Bill (Lance Henriksen) who sets up some bumps in the night and some sound effects around the joint. Then he will put some props out like dolls and just things of interest for the crew to talk about on the show. So when there is banging and some creepy things happening they just think its Bill. Nope. Then a cat comes flying at them and... I'll let you watch. I was actually happy with the way this went. Some good creep and sound effects. Jump scares add to the overall feel of the flick.

Openly fake, semi-successful ghost hunting team (more Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters than Paranormal State) go to scary former orphanage.

The initial part of the film is campy and ridiculous. But in a fun way. It's silly and sets you at ease. The actors had chemistry and you get to know that they went to school together. They have Julie, who honestly needed more screen time, but they were all obvious friends and enjoyed their show.

They did what I have been wanting, but unfortunately only for a short time. The Strangers is so scary because of that feeling of dread. The next portion of that film had it. Simple shadows and noises without giant faces jumping out at you and cheesy CGI graphics? Give me that type of scare.

Eventually the bad CGI came in, and while the acting was good and there were a few more jumps and creepies, it took me out of the fear and it got dumb.
