8265490,4,B0017APPXO,"AVENTURA EN RIO- Alicia (Ninn Sevilla) traveled with her husband, who is a doctor, to Brazil, where a Medical Congress took place. Her sister (Anita Blanch) feared the worse due to some cases of schyzophrenia in the family and she was right: Alicia suffers amnesia and gets lost in huge Brazil!

Luckily, Alicia's amnesia is the good kind, because after she is rescued by Rosa, she takes her to a Night Club, where, despite of being a normal housewife before, now she turns into a aggressive dancer and singer... in portuguese!!

Alicia, now another completely different person, names herself Nelly, she smokes, drinks and shows a total opposite side of her. I don't know how long they stayed in Brazil, but one day she is recognized by someone who runs to tell her husband, who, couldn't wait any longer, and was about to marry HIS SISTER IN LAW!!

Lucky girl Alicia, get back home in time to recover her memory, stop her husband from committing that kind of sin and go back to Mxico. But some questions arise: How long Alicia's memory stay this time? What will she become next time she suffers an amnesia attack? A rocket scientist? A micro surgen? An actress?",1316822400,,1162,4.686274509803922
