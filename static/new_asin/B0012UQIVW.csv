I watch this video quite frequently in HD!!! Anna Nebtreko steals the show singing D'Orestes D' Ajace (Illia) from Idomeneo.

8247876,3,B0012UQIVW,"On top of the 22 operas published by Deutsche Grammophon and DECCA to celebrate Mozart's 250th birthday, DG decided to release this concert, which was a gala evening that took place in the course of the 2006 festival. This is really an evening of two halves:

The first one is quite magical and good. Daniel Harding starts with his imposing ""Don Giovanni"" overture (in the swift tempi he uses in this piece), Ren Pape brings a lot of expression (and also a hint of vulgarity unfortunately) to Leporello's catalogue aria. But the stars of the evening are in my view Michael Schade (in much better voice than for his ""Clemenza"" for Harnoncourt back in 2003 - singing a piece from Clemenza and a beautiful ""Dalla sua pace""), Patricia Petibon in the treacherous ""Nel grave tormento"" from Mitridate, and Thomas Hampson in a ""Cosi"" aria ultimately rejected by the composer.

...but after this, the rest of the concert is quite disappointing. Kozena and Siurina duplicate their aria and duet from ""Idomeneo"" (while the other singers of the M22 collection who were singing at this concert had made an effort to diversify their repoertoire), Daniel Harding conducts a thick Prague Symphony (except for the last movement) and the Queen Netrebko, who has been given ""D'Oreste, d'Aiace"" from Idomeneo to sing, gives the impression of sending a nuclear bomb on Liechtenstein...

Overall, quite a waste of time (and money).",1350172800,3,1409,4.961864406779661

Very short DVD.
Be aware of it before buying.
I was extremelly disappointed, although the performacs are great, I felt deceived.",1290124800,6,159,4.925925925925926

8247879,3,B0012UQIVW,"As soon as it came out I bought it and I felt a bit disappointed. Even though the singers are quite good, each and every one of them sing just one aria and in many cases you are expecting to listen to another one sung by the same artist. But that does not happen, they just sing and vanish and there is no singing all together in the end. Actually the conductor and his orchestra finish the concert with three instrumental pieces at the end. It lacks strength as a whole but there are certain magical moments such as a bass singing the first aria (Pape) or the ever shining star Netrebko. If you are into opera do not expect too much and it may fulfill your expectations.",1219449600,33,671,4.25
