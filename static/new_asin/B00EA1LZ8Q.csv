8603112,4,B00EA1LZ8Q,"Known for such stirring dramas as Walking on Water, the two Yossi movies, and The Bubble, Israeli director and writer Eytan Fox presents us with a musical comedy about a group of Tel Aviv neighbors who find themselves, almost as a joke, being enrolled in an international singing competition held in Paris. As promoters attempt to add lots of flash to the act and strip them of their honest presentation, they fight back to perform in their own unique style. Just as in their performance, the various characters come to terms with more honest personal love relationships along the way. Yes, it's a bit of fluff, but a fun bit of fluff, especially for those emotionally drained by Eytan Fox's heavier dramas.",1418601600,,707,4.80327868852459
