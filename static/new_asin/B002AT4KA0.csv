3891579,3,B002AT4KA0,"It has been a long time since I've watched the original, but I knew what was going on and who everyone was. 5 years after the original, Dom and Brian are back together racing, and getting revenge! They are both looking for a man named Braga, a drug lord who recruits street racers to move heroin across the US-Mexican border. If you like the Fast and Furious series, action, and suspense, you'll love FAST & FURIOUS!!!",1245283200,2,418,4.5131578947368425
3891580,1,B002AT4KA0,"Terrible movies with a horrifically moronic econobox, fart cannon and park bench wing equipped fan-boy following.  These movies are just plain worthless and completely insulting to those with any hint of intelligence.",1244851200,4,217,5.78125
3891581,5,B002AT4KA0,"Dominic Toretto, street racer-thief who's still wanted by both the law and some criminals he has crossed, decides to cut himself from everyone close to him including his girlfriend Letty. Later he learns Letty was killed in L.A. so he returns to find out what happened. Brian Conner, an undercover cop allowed Dom to escape instead of turning him in, now works for the FBI. He's been searching for a elusive drug dealer known as Braga. His trail leads him to the same man that Dom is looking for. It seems that Letty was working as a courier for Braga. When Braga searches for some new drivers, Dom and Brian put themselves forward. Dom wants to get to the man who killed Letty while Brian is looking for Braga. I already have the first two Fast & Furious movies and even The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. All these movies are fantastic.",1244678400,4,842,4.509803921568627

3891605,4,B002AT4KA0,"Fast & Furious (4) may not be as good as movie 5, but it's really in movie 4 where they start to develop and blow out the theme of family. So this is still one of my favorites in the franchise. There are definitely some odd story moments, but hey, you know what you're getting with the crew.",1496534400,,291,4.0344827586206895

3891613,4,B002AT4KA0,"After it was rented, then you said their were no captions - great movie but no sub-titles.  Could have watched it for free on other sites.",1491868800,,138,4.3076923076923075
3891614,4,B002AT4KA0,"This movie starts off with a visually spectacular but unnecessary heist of the trailers of a petrol semi tanker road train, they could have just stolen the trailers when it was stopped at a road house or even staged a car crash or something ahead of it and pulled a gun on the driver or something.  Basically this is a vengeance flick as a drug smuggling with fast cars operation is joined by Diesel's character, while Walker also wants in to put the cartel guy behind bars.  This one is good parts but weak in others, it uses a truck scene from Cannonball Run at one stage.  The next movie and the best of the sequels in my opinion continues directly on from this ones final scenes.",1491523200,,683,4.362204724409449

3891630,3,B002AT4KA0,Would've been nice if I could've finished it? The 24hr. period ran out before I could finish it. The main reason is because of the busyness of the holiday season. Plain and simple. Would it be possible to get a freebie and I WILL rent that movie again. I think the 24hr. period is a bit quick in my opinion anyway. I love Amazon and will never go from it but the movie portion needs a bit of tender loving care for the customer.,1482796800,,428,4.107142857142857

3891778,5,B002AT4KA0,"At the time of its release back in 2009 Fast and Furious was the best movie of the series. The crew was back together. The movie was very exciting. It dazzled, it sparkled, it wowed. There are scenes that made you jump out of your seat or kept you on edge. The whole franchise was revamped to create more movies to follow. I truly enjoyed this movie when it was first released. I can also say that with each release the series got better, became more dangerous, pushed the envelope. I really love the action in this film even if there was too much fantasy car chasing.  I feel at some point they should hold a little something back to save the franchise. At some point there is no more wow factor and the audience would get a little tired of the impossible car chases it would have been a lot better with something more realistic. I still enjoyed it as a comeback movie.",1446076800,2,870,4.304878048780488
3891779,4,B002AT4KA0,"Thanks to Justin Lin's little experiment with a hillbilly in Tokyo, Fast & Furious 4 was born. Whether it was Vin Diesel's cameo pay check or Lin waking from a vivid dream with cold sweats at 3AM and putting pen to paper, somehow - this film was made. Considering the turd that Tokyo Drift actually was, this film was actually good.

Fast & Furious literally saved the franchise, turned things around and put things back on track. I felt the character development and story were a lot stronger in this film than other entries in the franchise. Underrated.",1445990400,,555,4.663265306122449
3891780,5,B002AT4KA0,The beginning of a thrill ride that just does not quit.  When Vin and Paul start the greatest car chase series ever.  The chemistry between the characters can't be faked.

3891938,3,B002AT4KA0,I mean it's a big dumb action flick. If you want more Fast & Furious- here you go. It's a lot of fun but don't expect big ideas from a movie about cars and the shaved headed gorilla man who drives them (j/k I love Vin),1427932800,,218,3.760869565217391
3891939,4,B002AT4KA0,I really enjoyed watching this one.,1427932800,,35,5.0
3891940,4,B002AT4KA0,"Just like the last two Fast and furious films, I couldn't decide whether to give ""Fast and Furious"" 3 or 4 stars. I think this one's worthy of 4.
This film feels like the first real sequel to the original because it continues the story of the first film instead of doing new stories and because they brought back a lot of the cast, unlike the last two films.
Dom(Vin Diesel) must team up with estranged former best friend Brian(Paul Walker) to take down a drug kingpin and avenge the death of someone that he loved.
The plot is full of holes. Well, they were either holes or just plot points that were really, really stupid. I can't tell.
Honestly, this film is a close second in this series' race for ""most idiotic movie"". First place goes to the 2nd film because that film was so obnoxious about it's stupidity, but this film is a close second because it is just so, so dumb.
The character development wasn't great, with these usually beloved characters. The acting wasn't a real treasure. Paul Walker was outstanding during the scene when Dom finds out ""who was running Letty"", but that's the only praise I can really give out.
Also, the portrayal of the character of Dom was questionable. Dom is usually the family man. The father figure. He's always cool and composed, except when he's not. In this film, he is very dark as he is out for revenge for someone he loved. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the idea of changing a character up for a film. However, I don't think this is the best way to portray Dom seeing how this is the first time we've seen him in 8 years(aside from his cameo in Tokyo Drift.) I would love to see them take another swing at the ""Dom going through a rough time"" thing in a future film, now that they've established him as a strong, lovable character in the 5th and 6th films. Maybe in one of the upcoming films, something can happen to him and that would make him be really angry all the time and that would be something the crew has to deal with. He can start throwing his values out the window, and then have him realize what a jerk he's been and that he has to get over it and then have him come back in full form ready to fight for the final battle. I seriously hope they do that! That would be so awesome! Having been set up a such a great, lovable character in the 5th and 6th films, it will be really tough to watch him act erratic but really rewarding and heroic for him to come back to form. By having him act like this in the 4th film, when we still aren't all that familiar with him,(or at least not as much as we are now.) it's not too effective and he just comes across as a dark guy, which he isn't.
Also, why is the film just called ""Fast and Furious""? Shouldn't it at least be like Fast and Furious 4?
The film in undeniably fun though. Between Justin Lin's sure handed directing and Brian Tyler's excellent musical score(which honest to God makes many of the action scenes 10x more exciting.) Fast and Furious is, at times, a total blast!",1427846400,,2987,4.288495575221239

3892170,5,B002AT4KA0,"Fast and Furious (2009). Rated ""PG-13"". Running Time: One hour, 47 mins.
This is the fourth film in the series.

Returning: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Sung Kang, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Jimmy Lin, Victoria Gracie, Rana Morrison.

Dom (Vin Diesel), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and the rest of the gang are in the Dominican Republic attempting to hi-jack a diesel truck with five tanks. The driver (Alejandro Patino) has a pet Iguana. Letty jumps onto the back on the fifth tank and then manages to separate two tanks from the load. The diesel truck driver hits Dom's car and shoots at him. Letty is hanging on to a tank for dear life. The gang puts a hitch on the back of the tank. The road goes downhill.
  I'm not going to tell you how they get out of this one.

Dom knows the police are getting closer to him. Letty questions that after so many years they have been doing this, why is it dangerous now?  Quietly in the night, Dom leaves Letty.
  Back in Los Angeles, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is chasing after a criminal (Luis Moncada) on foot.
  In Panama City, Dom gets some shocking news over the telephone. He has to go back to Los Angeles.

Also in the cast: Laz Alonso, John Ortiz, Shea Whigham, Tego Calderon, Gal Gadot, Marco Rodriguez, Ron  Yuan, Antonio Echeuerria, Don Omar.

Shocking ending! I thought Oh Hell No! No Way!

3892238,5,B002AT4KA0,"And i didn't think much of it, I recently seen fast 6 and realized this FF movie was one i didn't have in my collection, so i ordered it up on AMAZON !! On to the movie itself, A little ***spoiler*** for those that may not have seen this.. This FF is the turning point movie in the series and frankly its probably one of my favorites, It brings most of the old crew back together for the first time since FF#1.  and frankly its a little darker, its not all neon lights and street races.. Its still alot about the cars and alot of car action for us guys that fell in love with this series for the cars and the car action (some of the latest FF is less about the cars and more about action adventure) and ive said that before in a few other reviews.  But this movie Fast 4  feels more serious, you deffinately get the impression that the series is taking a turn with this one.  I rewatched this today and its a great movie, There is alot that happens in this movie that you need to know and remember to understand fast #6, there are alot of references in Fast #6 to this particular movie in the series.  Most of you can watch fast #1 #2 (skip 3) watch #4 #5 and #6 and maintain the story line at this point. there are references in fast #6 in the end to Fast #3 Tokyo Drift so i may eat my words later on down the road.. guess we will just have to tune in and see what happens..",1371600000,,1376,3.9890909090909092

I recommend you don't rent from Amazon unless your internet connection is excellent. If that's the case, I'm sure the instant video service is great.",1371513600,,422,5.0285714285714285
3892240,3,B002AT4KA0,I have seen so many of these movies I can not remember what this one was about (lol) but each movie that comes out gets better.  If this is the first one it was okay.  Paul Walker is finer than the law allows.  The acting is as expected and the storyline is silly but it is all about the cars so focus on that.  ;-),1371081600,,315,3.8

3892245,2,B002AT4KA0,"I was turned off in the very beginning where they are hijacking a gasoline truck somewhere in Latin America.  They do all sorts of ridiculous automobile stunts (such as driving high speed in reverse, standing on the hood of a speeding car...) to steal the gasoline, when they could have more easily and with less risk taken the truck the old fashioned way - stopped it at a road block and made the driver get out and drive away.  Then there was the crappy CGI of the gasoline truck crash.  I thought it might get better, but it didn't.

As the plot wears on, there is the typical rogue cop who is going to get fired any time now.  He beats up another cop and I have no idea why, and that is never resolved (maybe I wasn't paying enough attention).  The rogue cop does the typical extremely dangerous chase scene after some guy for something (does it matter?).  The main character's girlfriend gets killed, and I am still not sure why other than to piss him off at a Latin American drug lord who inexplicably lives in the US.  As the movie wears on, the Rogue Cop and good guy (played by Vin Diesel, and is actually a bad guy), go to Mexico to haul in drugs in very fancy cars though a tunnel while the Border Patrol is trying to catch them.  I'm sorry, but I still can't figure that out.  The tunnel is long, cut in rock, yet somehow the US Gov't didn't see it built.  Why did they bring attention to it by racing cars into it at high speed?

The movie wraps up predictably with the bad guys getting arrested/killed in the most ridiculous way possible, the rogue cop somehow keeps his job and gets the girl...

I suppose this got a good rating because it is high action, lots of car crashes and so on.  I also know I have to suspend disbelief whenever watching any kind of action movie.

3892254,5,B002AT4KA0,"""Fast & Furious"" is great! This is how the story goes: When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dominic Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Conner. But as they are forced to confront a shared enemy, Dominic and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel.

The cast led by Vin Diesel (as Dominic), Paul Walker (as Brian), Michelle Rodriguez (as Letty) & Jordana Brewster (as Mia Toretto) is great! The directing by Justin Lin (who also directed ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006, which had a cameo by Diesel) & ""Annapolis"" (2006, which co-starred Brewster and Walker's ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (2003) co-star, Tyrese Gibson) is great! The story and screenplay by Chris Morgan (who also wrote the story and screenplay to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"", ""Wanted"" (2008, screenplay) & ""Cellular"" (2004, screenplay) is great!

The music by Brian Tyler (who also did the music to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"", he also did the music to the upcoming ""Dragonball: Evolution"" (2009) & ""Final Destination: Death Trip 3D"" (2009) is great! The cinematography by Amir Mokri (who also did the cinematography, recently to, ""Vantage Point"" (2008) is great! The film editing by Christian Wagner (who also did the film editing, recently to, ""The Uninvited"" (2009) & Fred Raskin (who also did the film editing to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" & ""Annapolis"") is great! The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller (both also did the casting to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" & recently to, ""Hotel For Dogs"" (2009) & ""Race To Witch Mountain"" (2009) is great! The production design by Ida Random (who also did the production design to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"") is great! The art direction by David Lazan (who also did the art direction to ""Constantine"" (2005) is great! The set decoration by Douglas A. Mowat (who also did the set decoration to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" & recently to, ""Role Models"" (2008) is great! The costume design by Sanja Milkovic Hays (who also did the costume design to ""The Fast And The Furious"" (2001, which also starred Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, & Brewster), ""2 Fast 2 Furious"", ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"", ""XXX"" (2002, which also starred Diesel and was directed by ""The Fast And The Furious"" director, Rob Cohen), ""XXX: State Of The Union"" (2005) & ""The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor"" (2008, which was also directed by Cohen) is great!

This is a great sequel that is better than ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"", but just as great as ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" & the original ""The Fast And The Furious"". This is the sequel that should have happened 6 years earlier, but, still great, nonetheless. Vin Diesel is back and is better than ever in his comeback vehicle.",1369526400,,2994,4.753846153846154

  being fans of the fast and furious series, this one Fast & Furious (2009) does not detract from the storylines.  spoiler alert...rebels rebel, bad guys chase, good rebels win in the end.  it fits into the series well.  perennial bad guy in everything, john ortiz, adds a little zing to this story.  the action does not rest and the chase is just as good as the others, but it may be the best so far.  hard to beat the train and car scene, but it is exciting.  the characters play well and the action does not stop.  you will not be disappointed...  yrmv",1369008000,,562,4.3173076923076925

3892259,5,B002AT4KA0,Not as good as Fast Five but still one of the best. Has a crazy cliffhanger ending! This movie has Vin Diesel in it this time and nearly everything else that makes the other Fast/Furious movies enjoyable. Worth seeing.,1368835200,5,218,4.615384615384615
3892260,4,B002AT4KA0,"Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the Fast franchise.  I could enjoy Fast and the Furious for what it was.  2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races.  Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise.  There are many reasons for why this is.

I find the characters to be much better this time around.  Vin Diesel's character, Toretto, is back with a vengeance.  Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones.  At the start of the film he leaves his gang because the police are gunning for him.  He then gets a call from his sister saying Letty (Michelle Rodriguez's character) has been killed.  Now Toretto is on a revenge mission to kill the person who killed Letty.  This makes it more of a personal story for the characters, especially Toretto, which I like.  I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.

I like Paul Walker's character, Brian, more here than any of the previous films.  He seems more mature and professional here.  In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent.  I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie.
Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest.  I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do.  The other characters are not much.  Han Lu form Tokyo Drift returns here, as well as Letty.  However, they only show-up in the beginning and then disappear from the movie.  This story is really about Brian and Toretto.

The villain is also very lazy.  The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak.  The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favorite villains of these movies.

The races are still fun to watch.  The races here are probably some of my favorite of the franchise.  Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out.  There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable.  The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.

Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favorite Fast film so far.  I definitely like it more than the films before it.  I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc.  The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI.  For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.",1368403200,,2571,4.276507276507276

It seems that if a movie avoids outrageous violence and sexuality, they move right to predictable and boring. This type of opposite ends of the spectrum shows a lack of creativity in my point of view.

If you need to move right to violence in order to be interesting, perhaps that also shows a lack of intelligence? Not trying to criticize, just saying that I do expect more out of authors because I believe they are capable of more. I think that they move right to violence and sex to make the movie interesting out of laziness on their part.

3892292,4,B002AT4KA0,"In case you are not aware, this iteration of ""The Fast and the Furious"" is number four in a well received line of theatrical offerings; a genre of movie that has helped fuel (no pun intended) the love of Illegal Import Racing.

In this 4th installment, the cast of the original ""The Fast and the Furious"" make a much anticipated and needed return to the series. This time around, the group is stronger, more mature and well seasoned. For most viewers, the F&F franchise is watched for the cars and incredulous driving sequences, NEVER the acting. I am happy to say that the acting is very good, considering the scripts the actors were given. While no one will win an Oscar for their performances here, there was a decent storyline and a plot that tried to tug a little at the heartstrings. It was actually nice to see the chemistry between the reunited Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Sadly, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez' speaking parts were far and few in between. Considering the amount of dialogue they were previously given in the original F&F, their lack of onscreen presence was a little disappointing... again, a little.

This Fast and Furious is a prequel to ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". In that movie, we were introduced to Han, who, subtly in the last 2 minutes of the movie, was revealed to be a friend of Dom (Vin Diesel). That movie left open the possibility of there being yet another F&F movie. Well, in this prequel, the relationship between Dom and Han was fleshed out a little more, giving fans of Tokyo Drift some much needed back-story.

The premise of this movie is simple. Drive like you stole it and PURE REVENGE. I don't want to fire off any spoilers here, so I'll make sure not to get too deep into the twist(s) in the storyline. I will say this though, in keeping abreast with the times and with those more ""green"" conscience, the 1st 20 minutes or so of the movie is devoted to the liberating of fuel from the hands of greedy commercialist businessmen and giving back to the people. The first exciting stunt sequence is found in this part of the movie, located in the Dominican Republic. One of the gripes I had about the first 20 minutes or so of the actual theatrical release is the fact that the audience was really never queued in to why the fuel was being taken. Thankfully, this has been clearly addressed in the mini featurette, Los Bandelleros. More on that later.

This release of F&F is slightly more mature in feel. The actors are 8 years older and their onscreen counterparts have also matured. Paul Walker's character is now in the FBI's Los Angeles Narcotics Division, while Vin Diesel, who is still on the wrong side of the law, is more akin to a modern day Robin Hood. Michelle Rodriguez has grown a little, though we don't see much of her to determine how much she has matured and Jordana Brewster's character likewise has grown, living on her own in the house she and Dom once occupied. I think the writers did a good job at introducing a few new characters into Dom's ""circle of friends"". These individuals (including Don Omar) are a quirky bunch, that actually lighten the mood of the film in needed areas. Earlier I mentioned the short film ""Los Bandelleros"". Unlike many featurettes on DVD's, this short film is an actual Hollywood movie. Produced by Vin Diesel, this film goes deeper into the relationship between Dom and his core circle of friends, including the ""soon to be deceased Han"". In this featurette, we find out what the deal is with the fuel and can actually side with Dom and his crew for Fuel Transport Rig heists. While only 20 minutes in length, the featurette is a must see addition to the film and I would suggest watching that prior to loading up the full theatrical offering.

Of course this movie has fast cars and some awesome racing scenes. However, these aren't the meat of the film. They are more of a seasoning, which works quite well for the film. Since this is a more mature offering, I think that wanton usage of cars and the exploitation of scantily clad females would be a gross disservice. The cars play the roll of getting the plot from point A to point B... and quickly.

All in all, I pretty much enjoyed this film and would recommend it to automobile lovers and movie lovers alike. I give it a 4 out of 5.",1359504000,,4310,4.547680412371134

3892304,2,B002AT4KA0,"I'm not much of a fan of the original, and not at all of the spinoffs or ripoffs. Fast and Furious was as entertaining as the original without the originality. I only watched it because it was broadcast. In the age of mma, Vin Diesel's tough guy machismo is comical rather than intimidating, and Walker's beta male as leading man style is an awkward phenomenon. An action movie will only ever be as good as it's protagonist is inspiring.

There were a few scenes that were fun to watch, like the tunnel scene at the end, but the fun never lasted long. The only standout was the actor who played Braga, the main antagonist. This movie is summed up by the scene where Diesel and Walker say to each other, ""You thinkin what I'm thinkin"", referencing a plot revelation the audience saw well in advance. That is to say, ""Fast and Furious"" is essentially a collection of well-used action movie techniques stitched together unimpressively.",1355184000,,932,4.682926829268292

I was actually excited to see the original cast come together for this fourth installment.  Sadly, it's a disaster.  I mean, this is barely entertaining.  The premise is far too similar in scope to feel anything remotely enjoyable, and while this sites reviewer wants to tout these thrills as being anything but cheap, I must digress and state that these chills are the epitome of cheap.  They don't illicit anything genuine.  There is a limit to stupidity in a film.

In each movie, there is a story that draws you in and makes you care about the characters. The first movie and the third connect very well with this one, as the characters are developed further and emotional impact is added. My least favourite in the series in ""2Fast2Furious,"" but I recommend all of them. The films are rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.",1304121600,,736,4.7578125

To start off we see that Dom and Letty made it to Mexico, only to run from the law again and end up in the Dominigan Republic pulling the same heist except this time it's gasoline, the law is closing in on them again and Letty is murdered by a ruthless drug lord named ""Braga"".

The little problem I had with some of the plots is what ever happened to Dom's original crew ??? Leon, Vince, and Jesse [which everyone knows that Jesse died in the first film in a drive by shoot out by Dom's rival Johnny Tran.] it was never explained in the film of what became of the other two or why Justin Lin didn't decide to bring back Johnny Strong and Matt Schulze.

Then we see Brian O'Connor [the Buster gearhead undercover cop turned rogue now an FBI agent] on the trail for the same man.

The film get's even more interesting when Dom and Brian cross each others paths once again, but this time the reunion isn't so subtle like in the first film.

Mia is back and the moment she is taken into custody guess who comes to save her ? you guessed it her ex-lover Brian. I could go on and on about the plots and twist but the bottom line is this.., it is great to see the original cast again reprising their rolls all matured and seasoned drivers had Justin Lin bothered to do his homework instead of rushing off to do ""Tokyo Drift"" with an entirely new cast he probably would've come out as a winner, but all and all

3892349,5,B002AT4KA0,"Fast and Furious is one of the most thrilling, nail-biting, attention keeping movies. Having the main characters back in the same movie again is interesting because it helps you relate back to the very first movie that was created. Although one scene makes some viewers wonder if the movie should have been released before Tokyo Drift. One of the characters making a statement about keeping it real in Tokyo. In Tokyo Drift, the character who made the statement died. Other than that flaw, the movie kept the viewer very interested by fatal tragedies and the intense adventures the characters take. With Paul Walker and Vin Diesel teaming up once again, the two men continue their fearless, lawless ways in order to continue their quest. The main view of the movie is that Vin Diesel, showing his bad boy side, is trying to seek revenge from a loss of a loved one. Losing Letty in the movie was a real let-down in my opinion because she was the bad girl of the movie who was a total match to Vin Diesels character. Also, in my opinion, this movie is by far the best Fast and Furious sequel ever made.",1289347200,,1100,4.5606060606060606

Now, holed up in a beach shack in the Dominican Republic, and living on the run with the sole remnant of his past, Lett, he tries to piece together a new life. But he knows the authorities are always just steps behind him. And, when a tragic death of someone he loves brings Brian O'Conner back to L.A., Dom reignites his feud with the agent. As they are forced to confront a shared enemy, a sociopathic drug kingpin who is flooding the U.S. with lethal product, Dom and Brian must give it to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him and avenge the tragedy that he caused their small de facto family to endure.

Now here's something you wouldn't expect in the Fast and the Furious series: A sequel that is better than the original. I have to say, F&F is an impressive film compared to the first, a film that I already was impressed by. I guess the main reason is because of the nostalgia. F&F is a very satisfying film only if you watch it back to back with TFaTF, unless you can remember watching TFaTF a couple of years ago.

One thing that is extremely enjoyable about this film is how it references the first film, and it references the first film quite a few times. Another thing that is great is that the action sequences are more entertaining and still well made. Take the opening scene, for example. It's supposed to reference the opening scene in the first film but the one in this sequel is much more thrilling and exciting as hell. It's filled with so much energy that you'll be blown away and the use practical effects rather than CGI (with an exception of the climax of that scene) is commendable.

Speaking of CGI, the film, I'll admit, does use it more frequently than the original, especially the climax sequence. I guess that's a weak point of the film because the Fast and the Furious films are known for realistic car sequences. I liked the story as well because there's more weight to it. Add on to the fact that our four-member clan has reunited since the first film, which is really excellent. We get to see Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez develop their characters a couple of years after the first film. They seem much more mature and emotional in their roles.

Overall, I think this sequel is a perfectly well made film, even to an extent that it's better than the first film. The action sequences are more exciting than ever and you get to see the original clan reunite after two sequels! What's not to like?",1288656000,,2609,4.532908704883227

3892359,2,B002AT4KA0,"""Fast and Furious"" is the 2009 sequel to 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious"" - though, apparently, the two definite articles in the title aren't the only things that have gone missing in the follow-up to the original.  Absent too is any sense of tension - however slight - that was generated by the fact that undercover L.A. detective Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) wasn't who he appeared to be in the first film's admittedly rather hackneyed storyline.  Here former foes O'Connor and bad boy Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) are working together to bring a heroin dealer - responsible for the death of Vin Diesel's  girlfriend and partner-in-crime (Michelle Rodriguez) - to justice.  Meanwhile O'Connor may be rekindling the romance he had with Torreto's sister (Jordana Brewster), a woman he spooned then spurned in the earlier installment.

Of course, one doesn't go to a movie like ""Fast and Furious"" for the scintillating dialogue, the astute character development, or the Stanislavskian acting.  One goes for the nonstop car chases (not to mention the scantily-clad bimbos) and, in that respect, at least, this one delivers the goods, at one point turning the greater downtown L.A. area into a giant pinball machine for souped-up, tricked-out roadsters (though Mexico actually gets most of the hot car action here).  But even that becomes fairly mind-numbing after awhile.  And the movie itself is instantly forgettable.",1271548800,,1414,5.171052631578948

So when I heard the new version was the same actors as the first one, i knew I had to give the franchise one more try.  I was not disappointed, this is a decent movie with plenty of action, cars, and girls....basically the kind of movie that appeals to all guys and the acting and plot make it worth the time for the ladies.

3892373,2,B002AT4KA0,"What made the original and 2 sequels (horrible and cheasy sequels) at least decent was the campy nature and general love for import racing and streetracing. You felt that the movie was made by import car enthusiasts FOR import car enthusiasts. Sure the plot of the original might've been stretched and forced and at some points desperate, and the acting might've been somewhat cheesy, but overall you came to love the characters because they felt like real people, maybe not poeple you'd know or hang out with but real people. They messed up, got into fights, made mistakes, and became vulnerable and emotional. On top of that, the cars had a personality of their own, the car LINGO was interesting, and the overall love for cars was noteworthy. It was like the feeling of a car enthusiast going ""yea, that's right"" and almost feeling like they can contribute to all the gearhead talk of the first flick.
Then came the 2 sequels which while may have failed in the script and acting department, still won in the car enthusiast department. You watched the movie for the fast gorgeous cars, the hookups and the sexy women, and that's all you needed.

Now come in the 3rd sequel (or REAL first sequel) to the original; Fast and Furious. In short, the movie starts off promising within the first 5 minutes, but quickly becomes sunk and buried under its own desperate need to create a ""streetracer kingpin crime"" story that goes nowhere and achieves close to nothing. The film becomes boring after about an hour of overly serious talk and desperate attempts to get us to simply ACCEPT and STILL love these original characters from the first film even though they offer absolutely NO characterization in this new story of theirs.
To filmmakers: even if there were 5 F&F sequels featuring the same people and all of the first 4 films were golden, you STILL need to create worthwhile character situations and circumstances in the 5th film or else we'd hate it, memorable characters or no memorable characters. You cannot expect their performances in the original film to carry through to this one where there pretty much are no performances worth raving about.

The second tragic mistake about this film that the filmmakers made apart from deadpan characterization and an overlong and needlessly serious story and plot development is the complete absence of ANY sort of car enthusiast vibe or persona. Sure there are nice cars, and 1 noteworthy racing scene featuring nice hooked up cars (which lasts for like 5 minutes out of a 110 minute film), but there is NO car enthusiast talk, and NO excitement over street racing. They pretty much made a street racing movie without any real street racing nor ABOUT street racing. This is no longer a car enthusiast film made by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, it is now a crime drama 'reveal the druglord' movie made by greedy filmmakers trying to con enthusiasts by using the same characters from their earlier beloved Fast and Furious movie and trying to put it off as another dose of the same thing, when it indeed is nowhere NEAR comparable to the original.

And one more thing - what's with the forced hispanic ""chicano"" vibe of this whole thing? Now all of a sudden out of nowhere our main man Dom Torretto is no longer an average white guy gearhead but spanish? Was the first F&F movie too ""white"" for audiences? Did they feel they needed to ""minority"" it up to make it ""cooler"" and more underground like? Even the soundtrack is all a bunch of spanglish rap/hip-hop music that'll get on your nerves eventually. In the original there were various people and racers of various backgrounds and cultures, but they simply acted as such and didn't feel a need to rub it in other people's (or our) faces, they were real about who they were. Now all of a sudden everyone's gotta speak Spanglish and have a rippling bod? I am of hispanic heritage and I just find the whole thing forced and stupid. I can't imagine an average white viewer to be able to relate to this in the least, even IF they were a car enthusiast. Add a dash of a few scenes of grossly anorexic-thin girls making out with each other for ""sex appeal"" and you've got a forced and rushed film doused and marinated in CGI to simply make a quick buck by recycling old characters yet using them to no degree; they're all merely there for show to try and get you to buy a ticket.

On the upside, the blu-ray movie has really cool and interesting extras you might wanna check out. If you're a girl and find Vin Diesel and Paul Walker incredibly hot this is the movie for you, but I don't see any guys apart from burnout losers finding anything redeeming about this film besides a couple of decent action scenes.",1259280000,,4700,4.659036144578313

Do you like movies about cars? Well you are in luck. The Fast and Furious series are about people racing their muscle and streetcars. They race in the streets. There are no rules as long as you finish in first and anything can happen in these races. There are some reasons why you might be interested with the Fast and Furious. One reason is if you like racing movies. Another reason is if you enjoy watching sweet and fast cars like muscle and streetcars. One reason why you may not want to watch the Fast and Furious is if you don't like watching racing movies. The Fast and Furious movie series are about people racing illegal.",1256169600,,644,4.4576271186440675

3892380,3,B002AT4KA0,"Back when the first Fast and Furious came out, the souped up street racing scene was something, though not new, was not well know.  Now, after a wealth of street racing movies and the decline in the careers of Paul Walker and Vin Diseal, this movie can't capture the energy of the first one.  As a revenge movie, this film definitely has a darker tone, but nothing is really new.  At least Fast and the Furious 3 took the series in an entirely new direction, so long as you could believe someone in highschool had a massively receeding hairline.",1254528000,,545,4.484848484848484
3892381,5,B002AT4KA0,"It still has a lot of the flash expected from any episode in the Fast & Furious series, but there's more to this movie than eyecandy: The dialogue is surprisingly rich at times, and the acting delivers: you really feel like there's something on the line for each main character, and when Brian has a tough choice to make, you can see it on his face.

As others have said, the plot for this episode is better than the other sequels. It ties into the first movie really well, showing the consequences of what happened in the first movie for all of the characters, eight years later. And, there is a lot at stake for each of the characters,so don't worry: it's not one of those ""...remember when blah blah flicks"". Indeed, there isn't a single flashback to anything from the previous movies. Rather, it ties all three films from the franchise together, and shows the complete evolution of FBI Agent Brian's character (Paul Walker), as he once again tries to choose between siding with the law, or with his loyalty to Torrato (Vin Diesel).

Yep, it ties everything together, even Tokyo Drift. So you end up enjoying all three of the previous movies more as you see how this one ties them all together.",1254441600,,1197,4.562790697674418

3892384,5,B002AT4KA0,"This is a great movie! Just added it to my list of favorite movies! OK, history lesson, F&F1 stared Vin Diesel in another of my favorite movies. Then things went odd with F&F2; different story line different people; not one of my favorites. F&F3 Tokyo Drift is one of my favorites but yet again different story line and characters. OK, this F&F (F&F4) goes back to the original characters with the original people and extends the original story. Note, in the blu-ray version in the extras menu, there is a 20 minute short ""movie"" that fills in the gap between F&F1 and the start of F&F4.

Insanely great action. State of the art photography with alot of live action; some green screen and very little CG. And the various races and car chases are edge-of-your-seat intense!

If you liked any of F&F1 to 3, you will love 4! This is a must see and I will see it again and again. Its already loaded into my little portable movie player via Digital Copy.

3892392,5,B002AT4KA0,"The fast and the Furious 1, opened an all new gender in Sport Cars movies, hitting right where it's supposed to..

The fourth ""official"" sequel (It's really the 2.5 Fast And Furious Film, with in the time frame) is really exhilarating and regardless of the ""SUPER FANTASTIC ACTION"" performed as Dom and Letty escape from a rolling, flaming gas tank heading towards them and the video game sequence inside the maze of tunnels between the border of US and Mexico.

The movie really got back to the roots and stuck to the formula that gave them the success on the first movie.

Being Latin I deeply respect the different scenes from Latin America that are showed in this movie and they truly give the Latin tunning the place of respect they deserve for spooling the super tunning to another level with the different types of modifications made to the cars.

The trama of the 4th version of the saga is really intense and gives you the tunning world perspective and the real logical and well thought concept that makes the movie very interesting to car fans and movie fans and non fans as well.

My personal rating for the 4thlogy is:

FAST AND FURIOUS  ***** (Original and innovative)
2FAST 2FURIOUS  **  ( Play the video Game instead)
TOKYO DRIFT  ****  ( The actors swap, didn't help)
FAST AND FURIOUS (4) ***** ( New Model..Old Parts..) Really Version 2.5

3892404,3,B002AT4KA0,"While I liked the original crew from the first movie and a lot of the action, something about this fourth entry in the series makes me want to watch the first one instead.

Maybe it's some of the absurd notions (a container truck pulling four fully loaded fuel trailers? c'mon...) or the almost stupid spoon feeding (which criminal is the tuner? Let's see, regular car, regular car, regular car, tuned up car with illegal mods, regular car...oh, how about the tuned car?) but something about this movie made me hate it more than the first.

After all, you can't say it's because the actors were different...or the director...or the locale...or the cars...pretty much the same thing going on here. Maybe it's a sign that cookie-cutter movie making isn't entertainment or at least it's not something that'll excite you as much as the racing usually does.

The second movie was ridiculously asinine. The third (Tokyo Drift) was definitely fun though that was largely because the drifting was crazy. But, in the end, the first movie had all sorts of things going for it.

Now, that doesn't mean you won't get something out of this movie. I'm saying you need to decide where your loyalties are. If you loved the first movie more than the last two, then you're safe...buy it and enjoy. If you liked the other two as well, then coming back to this one might not be the homecoming you're expecting.

I watched this with my teenage daughter and she loved it too- even the goofy parts that made no sense, even when we solved the case before the cops did.  This is why you watch this film: Vin's muscles, the shiny cars, the pulsing synthesizer house music, the bubble boobed mini-skirted chicks, the ridiculous story- we were hypnotized.

The move is serious, and the acting 100000's better. Apparrantly everyone has been working on their acting skills over the past few years. The only thing I hated about this movie was that the one character I brought the film to watch doesn't last too long. O-well the movie is based around them. This movie has plenty of action, and it's not cheesy. There are no more ""Granny shifting and double clutching"" phrases in this movie. There is nomore ""happy go lucky"" street racer feel that 2Fast 2Furious gave off. This movie is series. Matter of fact this should have been the sequel to The Fast and The Furious. The one thing that suprised me about the film was how much the characters had developed. In the original movie they were all sort of ""cartoony"". That entire vibe is lost in this film. Like I said this is the Batman Begins of The F&F series. We go back to the roots of it all, and this time we do it right. There cars are there, but the story is focused and intense they are almost camaflauged into the plot. There is plenty of action, to watch, and not that ""lets jump over the bridge"" garbage from 2F&2F. This is probably the best F&F to date. I'm also guessing the last as well.

3892407,2,B002AT4KA0,"I am way too old to review this movie properly.  For me, an action film featuring muscle cars is 1968's Bullitt, 1973's Seven Ups, or even 1980's Blues Brothers.  Long continuous shots, no CGI with frantic intercutting by an editor sitting behind a computer, and actual muscle cars filmed at full speed with real engine sounds.  Younger kids may like their films manipulated to the point where it becomes a video game, so I can't really judge on those counts.

Since I watched this movie to see my favorite actress, Jordana Brewster, I will review it only on that criteria alone.  (So please don't vote for the helpfulness of the review if you are not reading this specifically for info on the aforementioned actress.

Here goes: She appears for about 6 minutes of the 107 minute movie, totalling six short scenes.  The super hot angle of her in the car that was touted all over the trailer and commercials, comes at the end, lasting under 1 minute before the credits roll.  (There were two 1 second shots that the trailer teaser alluded to).  On the cover of the DVD, she is at the very front of the featured characters.  Either she has a fantastic contract negotiations manager, or the producers of Fast & Furious 4 have taken Jordana Brewster fans for the biggest ride, ever.",1250467200,5,1278,4.64

3892410,5,B002AT4KA0,This movie was incredible! I rented it at the Redbox machine for a buck just to watch something and had to go buy the blu ray. It is really stunning in hi def. The opening scene is great and so are many other of the racing scenes. Very good stuff. I have no idea why anybody would give this a bad review. It had a decent plot but anybody watching this is expecting to see high paced intense action and this delivers that big time!,1249689600,3,430,4.070588235294117
3892411,2,B002AT4KA0,"Anyone with any intelligence knows these flicks are usually guilty pleasures that hinge themselves on car culture: bad teens, fast cars, racing, chases, crashes, and hot chicks. These kind of flicks usually contain a few bubblegum elements, but this movie careens wildly off the guard rail with an implausible and overly serious storyline, a lot of terrible acting, not enough real car stunts, and the completely humorless execution of a bad script. There are absolutely no jokes, winks, or smiles in this dented wreck of a film. There is a short ROAD WARRIOR gag at the front of the flick. And, only one good racing scene utilizing real stunt drivers. That's it. The two rips thru the border tunnels are CG.

Even though Lucas Black's performance was a serious affront to the profession of acting (Black played the kid in SLINGBLADE), at least TOKYO DRIFT had some great set pieces for the cars. The opening race thru the construction site, the drift race up the parking ramp, the chase thru Tokyo, and the final drift race down the mountain in that muscular Mustang, made it worth watching for all the car enthusiasts out there in TVLand.

Wow! Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are so bad in this flick it's almost laughable. The cars in this flick have more personality than these two guys. They're both sleepwalking thru their performances. Diesel squints and displays only two emotions. 1. ""Don't mess with me, I'm concentrating on the road."" 2. ""Don't mess with me, I'm concentrating on revenge."" Which is really just the same emotion. Diesel seems like a nice enough guy, but let's face it, he doesn't possess a great range as an actor. Paul Walker is just... well, Paul Walker. Paint him lime green, slap some rims and vinyls on him, and he's good to go. I was really looking forward to seeing Michelle Rodriguez strut her stuff in this flick because I adore her. But, it seems that these cola commercial filmmakers found a way to remove her early from the festivities before I could finish undressing her with my eyes. (sigh) At least she won't have to embarass herself in another one of these movies. So, something good did come out of this flick.

Two Stars (and that's being generous), because the look of the film is decent, there are some cars in it, and the music, though certainly cliche, is good. But, this flick is not even close to being a guilty pleasure. It's a junkyard dog!

Even the Gag Reel is awful. And completely unfunny.

If you're looking for a recent, and decent car action flick, you might want to rent Paul Anderson's remake, DEATH RACE. It's entertaining enough for a Saturday afternoon, and it's certainly better than this CARBOMB.

Just keep driving. There's nothing to see here, but a horrible car crash of a movie.

UGH!",1249257600,4,2752,4.720833333333333
3892412,4,B002AT4KA0,"I must confess, I purchase these Fast And Furious movies mostly to get a long, good look at Paul Walker... I had my doubts the fourth one in this series could be much good, but surprisingly it had me on the edge of my seat.  Brian O'Conner is an FBI agent trying to catch a major drug smuggler that is importing drugs via muscle and souped up Japanese cars.  Dom is after the same fellow for the murder of his girlfriend, Letty.  Dom's sister has brief parts also.  My complaint:  The women had such incredibly small parts in this, I fail to see why their names even hit the credits.  I would have loved to see more Michelle Rodriguez especially.  Why couldn't they kill off the sister instead?  (Just so everybody knows, I am speaking of something that happens at very beginning of movie.. not spoiling nothing here.)

A note to all:  Do watch the bloopers reel afterwards.  It is funnier than all get out watching these guys try to maintain serious faces while driving ""bumper cars"" surrounded by green walls.",1249171200,,1011,4.530386740331492
3892413,1,B002AT4KA0,"I was thinking new cars+original cast= YAY! I was wrong. This movie barely focuses on cars, it's more about a revenge plot the whole movie. Cars are kind of just a side thing. I say, if you really want to see it, go rent it for $1 at a red box. Not worth it. Tokyo drift was better than this one.",1249084800,6,296,3.8688524590163933
3892414,2,B002AT4KA0,"A big disapointment. With the return of the original cast I expected it to be on the same level as the first installment -- which it isn't. The screenplay has several holes, the excess of CGI images made the movie to look like a video game and very unrealistic (especially the tunnel scenes), and the plot is simply ridiculous. It is worse than 2 Fast 2 Furious, which is not that great. Only the first scene is interesting, all the rest is a waste of time.",1248912000,9,457,4.325581395348837
3892415,5,B002AT4KA0,this movie is amazing but the first one is better. but the 2 disc DVD has very very cool speicial features! its a must buy if your a fan of the series!!,1248912000,2,152,3.78125
3892416,5,B002AT4KA0,I loved this movie. PERIOD. The first and the last movies are the best. If you like this then check out Gone in 60 seconds.,1248825600,,123,3.96
3892417,5,B002AT4KA0,"Vin Diesel and Paul Walker team up again for some more heart pounding adrenaline action. Also returning are Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. It's been almost eight years since The Fast and The Furious first debuted in the summer of 2001. This movie takes place five years after the original. After hijacking fuel tanks in the Dominican Republic Dom (Vin Diesel) leaves his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and becomes a criminal on the run. When Dom gets a devastating phone call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom decides to return to LA to get revenge. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is now an FBI agent gets assigned to hunt down a drug lord named Braga. This new enemy ultimately unites Brian and Don who want to get revenge for the tragedy that happened to Dom. I will not give away anymore as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who has not seen this movie. I will say as a huge fan of the first 2 movies in the franchise (especially the first one), I knew this movie had a lot to live up to. I'm happy to say Fast and Furious does not disappoint. This Movie will have your heart beating FAST and FURIOUS. Just like the original film that started it all, this new movie will also have you on the edge of your seat. Don't listen to bitter critics, if you like a fun entertaining movie to take you away from your life for a few hours check this movie out! With an weekend opening of $72+ million in ticket sales FAST AND FURIOUS was the all-time biggest debut for the month of April. The blu-ray looks absolutely stunning in full 1080p and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound will give your home theatre a great workout. The blu-ray comes with a ton of bonus material including limited time digital copy and an iphone app that lets you access your compatible blu-ray player and control the virtual garage on your TV with your iphone.

3892418,5,B002AT4KA0,"This is a great movie, any fan of the first one gotta love this one.
The main characters are back, the story is pretty good, and action is even better.
First movie was good, second one sucked, third was alright it had few good scenes but with this one they went back to the roots. I hope next one they have more imports, because American cars suck, they always break down and need to be fixed.",1248739200,,393,4.184210526315789

3892421,4,B002AT4KA0,"After three high-octane rides on the street racing scene, the fourth film in the ""The Fast and the Furious"" series features a departure from the flashy, overblown colors, obvious CGI-enhancement, and at times over-the-top stunts of the previous two films. With ""Fast & Furious"" the series returns to its roots with a grittier, more realistic leaning tone and reunites the primary players from the original film's cast of gearheads for more high speed mayhem.

""Fast & Furious"" finds Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) continuing his lawless ways in the Dominican Republic alongside his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and a new crew of velocity addicted miscreants. When the law begins to close in on Dom and his crew, difficult choices are made, plans are put into motion, and a life is lost. All of this forces Dom to return to his native Los Angeles on a quest for answers and to ultimately deal with those responsible. While back in town, Dom is reunited, albeit begrudgingly, with his former friend Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), who once again finds he is torn between doing what he desires most or following the letter of the law he's sworn to uphold.

With the slightly weaker feel of the previous two films in the series, I was kind of unsure of how good this fourth attempt would prove to be, regardless of the fact that many of the original film's cast members were reprising their roles eight years later. After seeing ""Fast & Furious"" over the weekend, I can honestly say that any misgivings I had regarding the film were easily blown away by the sheer entertainment value and superiority exuded by this film over anything included in the previous two films.

Besides the original film's primary cast returning to the series that made them stars, the writer and director duo of Chris Morgan and Justin Lin (""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"") make their return to the series with a much more polished final product than what had been featured in their previous effort. The screenplay is a much more complex work than one may expect from this type of movie. Screenwriter Chris Morgan ups the stakes for all the players, delivering several twists along the way, and some very sharply written dialogue, all of which makes for a thoroughly entertaining ride from start to finish. The story really seems to focus on resolving storylines begun in the first movie, and creating a stronger link between all of the other movies in the series, especially ""Tokyo Drift"" (which has always felt a little bit like an outcast in the franchise). As a fan of the series, I believe that this film's more mature storyline and well-written dialogue showcases the time and effort that Chris Morgan put into this film, and the work definitely pays off by rewarding longtime fans of the franchise by interconnecting each of the films, while not alienating any newcomers.

Director Justin Lin shows an even steadier hand when it came to helming his second effort in the series. Even though Justin proved quite capable in capturing the high speeds and general fast-paced nature of the series with ""Tokyo Drift"", his work here is stronger even if it is with a little less flashiness. By approaching the film more in the vein of the original's look and tone, Lin imbues ""Fast & Furious"" with a grittier nature that cements its close ties to the aforementioned, along with having the slight feel of an urban crime drama (albeit without the same level of intensity inherent in most of those films). If there are to be any more films in this series, then I believe that the powers-that-be may have found a valuable asset in this director, and one that they should use whenever possible to maintain consistency between the installments (something this series has previously lacked).

As I've mentioned a couple of times already, the cast for this film features many returning members from the original film. Let's begin with one of the biggest breakout stars of the original, Vin Diesel (""A Man Apart""). In his reprisal as Dom Toretto, Vin gives one of the best performances of his career, if not his best yet (easily rivaling his work in ""A Man Apart"" or ""Find Me Guilty""). In this film, Diesel is given more opportunity to explore Dom, whether it is his passion for the various facets of his life, personal loss, the issue of trust, or merely the unbridled fury that we had only heard mention of in the first film. Here we are presented with a much more layered and developed anti-hero than had been previously established, and one who is more weathered and world-weary from all of the experiences he has endured whether good or bad. If there are still some detractors of Vin's work out there, then the combination of his movies mentioned above should help convince them to the contrary, so long as they ignore his misfire with the dismal ""Babylon A.D."".

Alongside Vin is Paul Walker as the other main lead for this installment. This film also marks Walker's second reprisal as the lead in this series, as Paul was the only main cast member to return for the initial sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious"". To be fair, Vin has also appeared in the series three times, although his second appearance was just a cameo in the final moments of ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". But I digress, now back to Paul Walker's performance as one-time ex-law man turned outlaw turned active FBI agent Brian O'Connor. It's a rather convoluted series of events that comprise O'Connor's storyline through the series, but it works. In the first film, Paul gave a fairly solid, if not flawed performance, which he proceeded to follow-up with a decidedly more surfer-esque, flat and stilted performance, replete with more ""Yo's"", ""Bro's"", and ""Check it's"" than one would care to count. Paul's third stint in the series, much like Vin's return, makes for his best performance of the series, not to mention his entire career. I used to think that he was one of those actors that merely skated by on his looks and onscreen charm, with very little acting talent holding it all together. With his performance here he is much more reserved and believable, even intense at times, to the point that one wonders if there may be hope for Paul's career as a serious actor yet. Gone are the various surfer boy idioms, replaced by a much more mature character who is still trying desperately to atone for past mistakes.

The final two returning characters are the two important female roles of Mia and Letty (Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez respectively). Both of these characters suffered from very little development in their first outing, a problem that has now been rectified by this film. The character of Mia is given a very emotional arc to go through over the course of the film as she is forced to deal with the return of her former lover and betrayer of her family, Brian O'Connor. Jordana proves with her more developed role and character arc that she has the acting chops necessary to handle more of the story should the occasion call for it, something that future writers of the series may want to take note of should her character make any more return appearances. Michelle Rodriguez has proven in numerous movies and on TV's ""Lost"" that she is a very capable actress, but in this series she has yet to really be all that important or necessary for that matter. In the first film she was merely Dom's girlfriend and not all that interesting beyond that; however, in this story her character is central to the film's main plotline. I have to admit that while I wasn't all that enthralled by Michelle's character in the original film, she definitely proved more interesting in this one, and was much more enjoyable to watch as she really seemed to be having a good time in the role.

Lastly, we have one key newcomer to the franchise. Actor John Ortiz (""Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem"") plays a man named Campos whose job is to find and recruit drivers to smuggle drugs for a very powerful Mexican cartel. I haven't seen John in any kind of tough guy roles, mostly because I haven't seen too many movies he's appeared in, but I have to say he was very convincing in the role. He portrayed the character with a subtle hint of menace, never really overdoing it just keeping an obvious air about him that this guy is not one to be trifled with. While he wasn't given an incredible amount of screen time, what he is given John makes the most of. John delivers a strong antagonist that could have ended up being just another stock character, but became something a little more developed thanks to his work in the role.

""Fast & Furious"" is by far the best of the sequels in the series, and easily rivals the original film, possibly even surpasses it. This is all due to a much tighter and more developed story, the best acting in the entire series, and a much more grounded sense of reality than the previous two films boasted. If you've been a fan of the series or have simply become disappointed by the direction it's taken in the previous sequels, then this is the movie to see as it undoubtedly kicks the franchise back into high gear.

As a side note, it's important to know that ""Fast & Furious"" occurs prior to the events shown in the third film, ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"".

8360300,4,B002AT4KA0,"Three movies after the rebooted The Fast and the Furious the franchise fumbles and grinds its gears just a little as they started the new modern era of these movies.  Reuniting Paul Walkers Brian with Vin Diesels Dom was a smart move and we wonder why it didn't happen much sooner?  But in this installment, which sets up the following films in what will become a strictly linear fashion, the racing flags are dropped and traded in for heist chases and outlaw cops and drug baron robbers as Dom and his team, including love of his life Letty, are highway robbers down in Mexico.  He and his team are outlaws and they end up running afoul of a major drug dealer.  Letty is apparently murdered by his main henchman and Dom decides that hes going to get inside to take the dealer out.  Brian, who has kept his affinity for racing and his personal connection to Dom and Doms sister, is on the case to capture the drug dealer.  Neither of them can get what they want until they work together and their strong brotherly feelings for each other get cemented in this outing.  They become the pulsing heart and veins of the F&F franchise.  The story is a little back-and-forth messy but packed with a decent amount of action.  Its a decent entry that warms up the engine for what is to come (and what is to come starting in Fast Five is completely bonkers).  IMO it is the least memorable entry in the franchise as it feels a little too much like the first film at times and not enough like the following films to come.
