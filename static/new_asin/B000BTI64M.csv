8092529,4,B000BTI64M,"I thought this was going be a movie but I should of look at it better I did not see that it said ---->> (Watchword Bible)<---- but I said to my self that I would keep it anyway once I got it. The only reason that I did not want it was because I already have the whole bible on dvd in watchword and it is 80 hours long. On the one that I owned already you can pick out any part of the bible that you want to hear and see in watchword at one time and just listen to that. It is called the new American bible and you can get that for about the same price,  But if all that you want to here is the Gospel of John this tells the whole story good and you will be happy with it.",1415059200,,671,3.627586206896552
