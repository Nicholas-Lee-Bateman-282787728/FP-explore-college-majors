8174274,5,B000005BWQ,"You don't have to be Irish to enjoy this wonderful sacred concert featuring music, old and new, of the Roman Catholic faith.  Presented a few years back, it features  Frank Patterson, long recognized as today's  most-renowned Irish tenor, and soprano sensation Regina Nathan.  What  voices!  Add to them RTE Cor na nOg, the famed Monks of Glenstal Abbey, the  Irish Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus, Iarla O'Lionaird, Ros Ni Dhubhain  and Tommy Keane, and this is truly a night of heavenly music! 23 selections  in all; some familiar, many not.  But it won't matter once you get into the  perfect mood this concert sets.  Tastefully filmed at the Point Theatre in  Dublin, with great camera work and terrific sound, I can't recommend this  video highly enough!",959126400,7,761,4.984
