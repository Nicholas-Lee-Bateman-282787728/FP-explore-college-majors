8221623,4,B000W8L3WE,"This bundle represents a savings of about 30% off of what this site charges for exactly the same items if you buy them separately. This is a great deal if you can afford it. However, there are a few possible problems besides the expense:

1. Several of these collections, the Buffy collection in particular, have been out for some time and ardent fans already have them.
2. The Angel collection that just came out has exactly the same DVD content as the individual seasons that came out on DVD between 2003 and 2005, just some additional promotional material such as a letter from Joss Whedon to fans.
3. The biggest problem with the collection that I see is that Stargate SG-1 has just been very recently released in a collectors' edition that has four discs of bonus material that you don't get if you just buy the ten seasons separately, which is what this bundle offers you.

5 stars for the content.
3 stars for the concept and timing.",1192406400,32,940,4.556213017751479
