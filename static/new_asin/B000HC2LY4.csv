8138518,3,B000HC2LY4,"I am not a fan of British comedy that is heavy on slapstick so this series would naturally have some problems for me.  However, the characters, especially Manny, are very funny most of the time and the dialog has some real zingers.  The central character, however, does start to wear thin because he is such a slovenly idiot and so over the top most of the time.  I finished viewing the lst season wondering if I could stand a second one but I think Manny might bring me around.",1193788800,,478,4.348314606741573
8138519,5,B000HC2LY4,This show is just to brilliant to be invented by an American......we just don't come up with humor this glib and interesting. There are at least 4 side splitting moments in every episode.,1192579200,,187,4.696969696969697
8138520,5,B000HC2LY4,"If you like British humor, you'll love Black Books.  If you're not familiar with British humor, I'd still recommend it!  The jokes aren't based in English politics or deep cultural references (although there are a few), rather there are jokes about doing your taxes, cheap airplane flights, corporate jobs, getting dates, yoga, et cetera.  Both discs have blooper reels, and they're hilarious.  The show often has a bit of slapstick, incorporating elements of Benny Hill-like humor alongside more intellectual jokes.  Altogether, the whole is eminently satisfying, and I laughed and laughed and laughed.",1190332800,,603,5.440860215053763
8138521,1,B000HC2LY4,"I'm originally from the UK and look forward to 'fixes' of UK comedy and drama whenever I can get them. 'Shameless' is excellent, 'The Office' is priceless and I was looking forward to this as it had been recommended to me by my brother.
I tried, but this seemed immature and poorly acted. In fact, it really started to annoy me after about 10 minutes. Lots of shouting, over dramatization and a reliance on slapstick left me cold.",1189123200,,430,4.5256410256410255
8138522,5,B000HC2LY4,"This wildly funny British series was a blind pick based on a recommendation from my on-line DVD rental subscription.  The first episode left me stunned - hard to believe I'd never heard of it before.  The performers mesh in a way that makes the dark and crazy comedy even funnier, and the outtakes and extras (particularly Black's Puppets) are even better.  I just returned my rental disks and am already in withdrawal; needless to say, I just ordered my very own copy.  This series is one of the funniest I've ever seen, and worth owning and watching over and over.  Highly recommended!",1188950400,,587,4.715686274509804
8138523,5,B000HC2LY4,"I had never seen this show on TV, and came across rather accidentally by a youtube video of part of the first show. That little clip was so funny, I ordered the whole DVD set, sure that the whole thing was as funny as those few minutes.

I was right.

The actors are perfect, playing their characters with great energy and honesty. The characters are beautifully flawed, creating many opportunities for wonderful humor, sarcasm, and events going wrong. Though all the characters are flawed, and Black is in many ways a rather unlikable cad, I found myself caring for all them and wanting much more after watching the last episode.

For those who like British Comedy, especially some of the darker stuff, I recommend this series wholeheartedly.

I'm still laughing!",1187827200,3,764,4.8538461538461535
8138524,5,B000HC2LY4,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  This series is only for those that enjoy a good laugh.  What's not to love about Dylan Moran and cast?  That beautiful Irish accent alone is enough for me...Loses steam towards the end of series #2, but it still remains highly original and truly hilarious.",1184284800,,277,4.851063829787234
8138525,5,B000HC2LY4,"I caught this show for it's short stint on comedy central and absolutely loved it. I had them all recorded on VHS but it was lost in the mix sometime ago. Last summer I took a trip to London and to my surprise it was available on the flight. After refreshing myself with how absolutely hysterical the show was, I found Series 1 and 2 on NTSC DVD. Unfortunately I was forced to download series 3 from a torrent since it currently isn't available on NTSC, only PAL. Coming from someone who usually downloads absolutely everything, this is a must own DVD for any one who is a fan of dark and dry comedy.",1181001600,2,600,4.271929824561403
8138526,5,B000HC2LY4,"Black  Books is, absolutely Great !!!. It's very funny and the characters are uniquely amusing. The best part is the program is situated in a bookshop !!!. I bought the DVD set for myself and have watched it countless times. If you enjoy English Comedy or BBC shows. This one is a MUST HAVE and SEE !!!.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Books-The-Complete-First-and-Second-Series/dp/B000HC2LY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Books - The Complete First and Second Series</a>",1180396800,,517,6.602941176470588
8138527,5,B000HC2LY4,"I finally purchased these as a Christmas gift for myself.  If you are a fan of the ""underground""-type shows or even the greats like Monty Python, you are likely to love these.  The discs have spent more time in my DVD player than their cases.  Very satisfying to watch again and again.  If you've seen Dylan Moran's comedy act, hang on because this is where he goes well over the top. The humor is outlandish and sometimes a bit cruel, but absolutely brilliant!  One of my favorite casts!",1169510400,5,488,4.5
