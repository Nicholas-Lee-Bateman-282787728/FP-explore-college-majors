8493924,3,B0066E6RQU,"Spencer Tracy lends his gravitas and gentle manner to a thinly drawn role as washed-up defense attorney Jim Curtayne in John Sturges' otherwise routine courtroom crime/drama 'The People Against O'Hara' (MGM, 1951).  Nothing objectionable about the proceedings-- noir-ish atmosphere (largely compliments of cinematographer John Alton), good supporting cast (including Pat O'Brien, John Hodiak and a young James Arness as the titular defendant) and competent screenplay-- but apart from Tracy's engaging performance it's nothing special either.  Transfer looks to be taken from a reasonably clean source print with clear audio.  3-plus stars.",1434844800,2,640,6.010989010989011

8493926,4,B0066E6RQU,"Spencer Tracy is a standout in this tale of redemption.  Playing the role of James Curtayne, an attorney who was once a  formidable and respected prosecutor and is now in his own practice handling civil suits, brought low by his penchant for booze, he is clearly a man battling his own demons. Staying on the straight and narrow with the help of his devoted daughter (Diana Lynn), all is well until he decides to help out a Johnny O'Hara (James Arness), a young man whom he has known for a long time.

It appears that Johnny has gone and found himself charged with Murder in the First Degree for a crime he did not commit. His elderly, impoverished parents implore James Curtayne to help their son. He tries to explain that he does not handle criminal cases but finds himself, in a moment of weakness, caving in and taking the case for peanuts. He is, however, thrilled to be back in the game.

Unfortunately, there are many impediments  to his quest to vindication for his client, last but not least, his client's reluctance to tell him where he really was the night of the murder. Moreover, his own weakness for booze also rears its ugly head, causing him to make some bad decisions. In the end, however, he manages to right what went wrong but at great cost.

Look for Pat O'Brien, who gives an excellent performance in a supporting role, as  homicide detective Vince Ricks. It is Spencer Tracy, however, who steals the show. Kudos goes to director John Sturges for pulling out all the stops.",1366848000,6,1495,4.5767790262172285
8493927,4,B0066E6RQU,"When has Spencer Tracy not ever been in top form? He's solid yet again and appropriately world-weary in 1951's THE PEOPLE AGAINST O'HARA, and maybe it's because his character in the film bears a similar cross. Like Tracy in real life, James P. Curtayne is an alcoholic. It's what forced him to shift career tracks, from the assistant district attorney's office to the less intense field of civil suits. Curtayne's concerned daughter (Diana Lynn) has put her life on hold to ensure that he doesn't relapse. As the film starts, she thinks her job nearly done. But how can James P. Curtayne reject the pleas of an elderly couple from the old neighborhood whose son had just been arrested on a murder charge? He's known his latest client, John Fordman O'Hara (James Arness of GUNSMOKE), from when Johnny was a pup. He's back to practicing criminal law.

Except that Johnny O'Hara's alibi is flimsy, practically insubstantial. The case against him is strong. Curtayne has his work cut out, and it's not helping that Johnny's keeping mum about his real whereabouts on the night of the murder. With the full resources of the prosecutor aligned against him, a washed-up, weak-willed, boozy lawyer navigates a landmine of liars and mobsters and is betrayed by his own flagging faculties and by his addiction. Redemption looks real blurry when glimpsed thru a bottle. But it sure makes for a compelling character study.

Pat O'Brien, who in the advent of the 1950s had been landing fewer and fewer parts, plays Homicide Detective Vince Ricks, and he owes it to Spencer Tracy. Tracy insisted that O'Brien be given a part in the film or else, and this served to kickstart O'Brien's fading career. Director John Sturges competently runs the show, upgrading what would've been routine material into a potent courtroom drama. It's sort of neat that, in the third arc, the picture shifts gears and becomes a noirish police thriller. THE PEOPLE AGAINST O'HARA is far from Spencer Tracy's best, but it's still very much recommended. He's that good.

3.5 out of 5 stars.",1351555200,8,2051,4.887931034482759
