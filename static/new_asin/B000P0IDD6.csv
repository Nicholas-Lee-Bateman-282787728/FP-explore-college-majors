8598203,5,B000P0IDD6,"Breastfeeding FAQs is a beautiful DVD presenting rarely captured mother-to-mother advice, essential for breastfeeding success.

Throughout the history of humankind until recent times breastfeeding was the only way babies were nourished.  Mother-to-mother teaching and advice were essential to infant survival.  Breastfeeding is a learned art--yes, it is instinctive--women and infants have a drive to breastfeed--but success is not guaranteed without preparation, knowledge, available support, problem-solving strategies, persistence, and patience.  The cycle of knowledge transmission from mother to daughter and friend to friend has been interrupted after thousands of years by powerful formula company lobbies that effectively halted the practice of breastfeeding in much of the world for two generations.

Through modern medicine, we are learning more and more each day about the profound health and bonding benefits of breastfeeding for baby and mother.  (Yet even as the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends breastfeeding for at least one year and longer if possible for optimum infant health, many pediatricians do not yet understand breastfeeding nor do they know how to support it.)

As the world returns to breastfeeding, how do we get the chain of mother-to-mother wisdom going again?  Who can we turn to for knowledge and support as new breastfeeding mothers?

Breastfeeding FAQs: Ask the Experts is the answer.  It is a lively discussion among experienced mothers who have each breastfed two to seven children.  What is unique about this group is that all of these mothers are also professionally involved in breastfeeding in some way, as healthcare providers, authors, educators, or advocates.  Their knowledge draws on both personal and professional experience.  In answering questions that every expectant and new mother ask, they provide riches of information in practical guidance, helpful hints, health statistics, world health authority recommendations, legal information (your right to breastfeed in public!), and sage advice that will empower you to be your own advocate (in the hospital, in the pediatrician's office, in public, with family, at work...) and to trust your own instincts to nurture and nourish your child as nature intended.

This is an awesome video for new moms and an essential teaching tool for health professionals.  Breastfeeding FAQs is a perfect companion piece to any one of Stephanie Scholz Neurohr's beautiful instructional breastfeeding DVDs in the Mother of 7 Birth and Breastfeeding Video Series.  The DVDs in the series feature world breastfeeding experts providing cutting-edge information and instructional techniques on Why To and How To breastfeed: Breastfeeding Basics, Breastfeeding Intensive, and Breastfeeding Comprehensive.
