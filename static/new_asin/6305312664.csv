1009023,5,6305312664,"I watched every game live during MJ and the Bulls run.  This video was a good highlight of all wonderful moments.  It is very motivating and entertaining.  Another great MJ flick is the ESPN 30 for 30 ""Jordan Rides the Bus"".",1377820800,,224,4.414634146341464

Just more highlights from his career up to his first retirement and his comeback. Nothing that any fan doesn't know about. still fun to watch Jordan dominate tho! ;-)",1203984000,,180,4.806451612903226
1009026,5,6305312664,"I watched this movie during my first year of doing graduate study. It really moved me. Not only it tells us the story of how Michael achieve his greatness, but also how we can come back to achieve even more great accomplishments.

Combined with tremendous illustrative music, this video should put some buterflies into your stomach. Everybody would love to watch this movie. Even for a non basketball fan, I think this movie would still be a remarkable movie to watch.",1141516800,,468,4.777777777777778
1009027,5,6305312664,"Being the MJ fan that I am, I have seen quiet a lot of movies about Jordan, and really I must say that this is one of the best, it has all those moves that just make MJ the great player that he is, I mean the way he moves with the ball, its just amazing, and unlike some other movies, this one doesnt waste long time on people talking, but shows what MJ is all about BASKETBALL.",1095897600,3,378,3.858974358974359
1009028,5,6305312664,This video features a complete summary that documents Air Jordan's remarkable NBA career which I think nobody will ever achieve. It is just as great as Michael jordan's career. But the video is inclued in 'Ultimate Jordan' on DVD.,1076544000,3,230,4.923076923076923
1009029,4,6305312664,This video is brilliant for getting a general picture of the the career of the legend that is Michael Jordan. However if you are a MJ groupy like me and you've seen all of his previous vids then there isn't much in this that hasn't been seen before. Still a great video and a must buy for die hard MJ fans.,1005782400,,306,4.032786885245901
1009030,5,6305312664,"This tape is simply amazing! You'll love it. You get to know MJ as maybe the greatest competitor in the history of sports. It covers MJ's family, his NBA debut, ""THE comeback"" and the double-three-peat in 8  years.  YES, I do recommend this tape. :) It's great!",957484800,10,261,4.531914893617022
1009031,1,6305312664,"I have all Michael's videos, I have all Bulls videos..and I thought this one would be different. Maybe the last video we'll ever see about Michael and this dinasty, and the did it with all scences from past videos. Ive  seen all before! , nothing new?  scences from air time, playground, bulls  videos, come fly with me, above and beyond..nothing new!  I think that  nobody showed anything about last championship run (I mean the locker room  scences after the title, grant park, or something different) Im very  dissapointed",949881600,18,525,4.8977272727272725
