8452130,2,B0050ZINRW,"I am a big fan of cooking videos and I feel like I often learn something or get some good ideas when watching them. That is what led me to this disk. Tom Small, the presenter, is head chef at what looks like a suburban Italian restaurant. Here, he gives you some suggestions for a summer barbecue at home. Nothing is complicated and the ingredients will all be found at your local supermarket. Inside the disk case there is a removable list of ingredients for all the recipes so that you can take it along to shop for them without having to first play the disk and write them down yourself.

This is one disk in a series of four,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dare-To-Cook-Seasonal-Italian-Cuisine-4-Disc/dp/B008DKHOFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dare To Cook, Seasonal Italian Cuisine (4-Disc)</a>, and this one focuses mainly on outdoor summer cooking. He makes a number of salads, plus fixes some meat and vegetables on an outdoor gas barbecue grill. The meat includes turkey burgers, lamb burgers, pork chops, and chicken. As I said, the meats are accompanied with grilled vegetables and salads. Although lots of what he makes here would be tasty and enjoyable to eat, it doesn't strike me as particularly Italian. For example, I would call the lamb burger with Feta cheese and yogurt dressing on a ciabatta roll American, more influenced by a Greek gyro than anything Italian. He also makes granola. Is that Italian? How about frozen yogurt with grilled fruit?

I was lucky enough to find this at my local library, but I don't think I will be returning to it. I don't really need to watch a DVD with ""Italian Cuisine"" in the title to learn how to make an iceberg lettuce wedge salad to go with turkey cheeseburgers. I watched all four disks in the series, and to be fair this is the only one without real Italian recipes.",1342137600,,1870,4.9712460063897765
