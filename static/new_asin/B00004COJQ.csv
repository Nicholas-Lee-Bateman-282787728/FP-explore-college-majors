7919805,1,B00004COJQ,"Wow, is this baaaaad. The plot is incredibly silly, even by science fiction standards, and stupidly inconsistent. Is it fatal to go outside without masks? Then why are our heroes doing it for most of the movie? Why does the main character see the ghost of another character despite never having known him? (The ""explanation"" given is so ludicrous I spit up my drink.) How exactly are the villains figuring to profit from turning humans into fish people? If you are a Doctor Who fan this is worth a watch because it includes four actors who played the Doctor in the '70s and '80s. If you aren't, stay as far away as you can. The script is, as I said, silly in the extreme, and it's directed on a shoestring by someone who only sort-of knows how. Of the four Doctors, Sylvester McCoy and Peter Davison come out looking the least stupid, doing their best to play this thing straight and almost making it look better than it deserves. (Davison is always the professional, no matter how deep he's mired in something unpleasant...see Parting Shots for an even better example.) Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant are completely unconvincing as a couple, and watching them kiss is cringeworthy. (Really, I could have handled seeing actors who had played Doctor and companion as lovers, but they were so awful it hurt.) I felt acutely sorry for Bryant throughout this travesty, in which she is not given a real character to play. Baker has the largest role and that's unfortunate for him; he doesn't manage to transcend the script as well as Davison and McCoy. I actually liked him as the Doctor, but he's lost when he can't play big and bold and blustery. As for the fourth of the Doctors, Jon Pertwee just waltzes in and makes a couple of enigmatic speeches. He's phoning this in, already at the pub in his mind. The outtakes are much more fun to watch than the movie; McCoy is really very funny in them. The interview with Peter Davison (I think recorded years after the movie was made) is also worth watching if you are a fan; it's fairly candid as these things go and I wonder if he'd had a glass of something beforehand. Bear in mind that I AM a major Doctor Who fan. If I thought it was as bad as I did, be appropriately warned. On the other hand, there's nothing better suited to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 type evening for Whovians. Make sure there's sufficient alcohol.",1371427200,,2369,4.5503512880562065
7919806,4,B00004COJQ,"Four former Doctor Whos are reunited, so that in itself is a treat.  The four are Jon Pertwee, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy, a.k.a. Doctors 3, 5, 6, and 7.  Two other Who alumni who appear are Nicola Bryant, who played Peri, the Sixth Doctor's assistant, but here, is Baker's co-worker and love interest, and Michael Wisher, best known for providing Dalek voices as well as playing Davros in ""Genesis Of The Daleks"" and appearing in ""Terror Of The Autons,"" ""Carnival Of Monsters,"" and ""Planet Of Evil.""  Wisher plays the Secretary of State for the Environment here.
The story is about investigative reporter Al Dunbar (Davison), who's latest target is the Airzone Corporation, an organization who has been hired by the government to clean up the air.  His mentor Oliver Trethewey, is mildly impressed with the video expos that opens the program, and urges him to press even further.  With the aid of his eco-nutter activist collaborator, Anthony Stanwick, Dunbar hacks into Airzone's central computer with a disk given to him by his lover, an Airzone employee, who is later discovered and subjected to the Airzone Solution.  Breaking into the central computer of the facility, Dunbar discovers a horrifying secret, at which point, he is detected by the alarm system.  Before he can escape, he is captured and later found dead.
Weatherman Arnie Davis (Baker), whose concern for pollution is limited to his cheery weather reports replete with clowning around, suddenly sees Dunbar dying and collapses during one of his reports.  Dunbar's reappearance begins to affect his job and personal life with Elenya Brown(Nicola Bryant).  He does some digging around of his own, and becomes involved, placing his job in jeopardy.
He unwillingly teams up with Stanwick, who doesn't seem to care too much for him, and with help from Ellie, tries to pick up the pieces where Dunbar left off.
Jon Pertwee (Oliver Trethewey), doesn't have much screen time, but appears as a somewhat omniscient presence looking out for Davis and McCoy.
Colin Baker as Arnie Davis puts in another solid role as someone who is trying to cope with the change in circumstance fate has thrown at him, and the birth of his conscience.
Sylvester McCoy plays Stanwick more irascibly than he did as the Doctor.  He's clearly scornful of Davis but is forced to become a reluctant ally in order to get to the truth behind Airzone.
The story is compact, leaving not much room for character development, but that can be excused by Bill Bagg's budget of an fifty-minutes to an hour for its programs.
 Set in the near future, Airzone presents a grim picture of a world where people need to be protected from the toxic air by umbrellas and oxy-masks.  Is this what we are heading toward, or is Kyoto merely the first step to prevent a scenario in Airzone from happening?  I only hope it's not too late.  In the end, the real Airzone Solution is a typical example of building a better mouse, not a better mousetrap.  I leave that for the viewer to discover.
The speech given by Airzone's CEO, Rachel Lonsdale, is not complete without merit.  It is true, after having developed so much technologically, we cannot go back.  Progress is the way forward, but progress can mean... what?  Well, definitely not the progress Airzone had in mind.  Heather Barker plays Lonsdale as the archetypal capitalist with ice in her veins.
Alan Cumming (Eyes Wide Shut, Spiceworld, Titus) plays McNamara, who appears to have a secret agenda of his own.
The show does leave one wondering if people like Rachel Carson became who they were by having the Earth fight against the pollution rained upon it by the human virus by converting certain people to fight for it.  It seems to be the case with Al Dunbar, and later, with Arnie Davis.",998179200,2,3783,4.84472049689441
