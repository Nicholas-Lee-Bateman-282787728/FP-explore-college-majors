7801264,5,1928828159,We have used this teaching in our youth and older couples in our church for several years. It is an awesome teaching and I would highly recommend it for all teens who are of dating age or soon to be. This teaching of Song of Solomon I can't say enough about!! Get it!!!Teach it!!! Our children and even the adults need it!!,1376611200,,323,4.225806451612903
7801265,5,1928828159,"Found the video series very helpful, informative and practical advice that could be easily overlooked.  Probably reading the book before seeing the series is also a great idea.  There was content that I saw before marriage and after getting married that really hit home and is useful to both a single and married.",1374796800,2,313,4.886792452830188
7801266,3,1928828159,I really like the in depth study of the Song of Solomon; but I had seen an earlier version in a class that I liked a lot better... Wished I had purchased the older version to share with my now young adult children!,1334880000,3,214,4.0
7801267,5,1928828159,Our married groups have used this and grown a lot. Good humor and Biblical teaching on a sensitive topic. The update is very good.,1317686400,3,130,4.458333333333333
7801268,2,1928828159,"lots of humor and very little real substance. get the book Intimacy Ignited for a good study. This whole DVD set was largely a waste of time. Very disappointing, especially for the price.",1316995200,3,187,4.696969696969697
7801269,5,1928828159,"This was an amazing video series that my wife and I watched.  Tommy Nelson does a great job of clarifying what the Song of Solomon is about.  I had never heard it taught on before, mainly because it is so erotic that no one would dare talk about it in church.  Yet, Tommy has done it on this video series.  Every married couple would benefit from this series.  Additionally, it is something that those who are not yet married should see.  He takes the vail off of marriage and what it really takes to have a successful marriage...it takes relationship.",1293321600,9,552,4.47
