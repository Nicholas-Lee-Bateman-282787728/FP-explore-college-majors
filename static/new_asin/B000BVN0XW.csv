8093222,1,B000BVN0XW,This is starts off great then goes on far too long when these robots start forming every letter of the alphabet.  That part of the cartoon should have played faster.  The visuals were great and the story was a nice change of pace.  Its just needed to be edited better,1506038400,,267,4.3
8093223,5,B000BVN0XW,"I don't know what kind of mind-numbing, hypnotic mnemonics they've laced this most horrible movie of all time with, but something's got my toddler obsessed with this movie and I'm actually okay with that.  We go over letters and ABC's with this and however annoying it is, I cannot deny that it's educational and he loves it, so whatever.
We found it on Netflix back in October of 2013 and from the first moment, he was hooked.  He sat through the whole thing then the SECOND it was over, asked for it again. And again. And again. And again...
We watched this movie probably close to 9 times a day every day until they removed it from Netflix nearly a full month BEFORE CHRISTMAS. Which didn't make ANY kind of sense at all.  When it was gone one day, my son literally cried, sobbing giant tears of loss as though someone had just murdered a puppy in front of him and continued to ask for it every day.  I told him, ""Z Bot had to go away honey, I'm sorry"" and well, that just wasn't good enough.  He continued to ask for it. Daily.
I looked for it on Amazon for him for Christmas, but it was sold out.
I then found it on YouTube sometime just after Christmas and it was as though the dawn was breaking over a dark valley of despair. ""Z BOT!!!"" he cried and jumped around like it was Christmas morning all over again.  We watched it on YouTube several times and then I found it back in stock on Amazon, so I bought it.
Well, today it arrived and I let him open the package.  I have literally NEVER seen my child so excited about anything in his whole life.  We have watched it nonstop since it came in the mail... THREE HOURS AGO.
Honestly, it's educational and has a great lesson about following directions and team work.  Low budget and silly- yes, but it's made for toddlers and it's absolutely perfect for them.",1398211200,,1814,4.311764705882353
8093224,5,B000BVN0XW,"Parents, don't try to watch this movie, it won't make sense. Let your toddlers have fun with this. My 3yo is obsessed!",1342483200,,118,4.409090909090909
8093225,1,B000BVN0XW,"Well, I just polled my nieces, they unanimously expressed their extreme dislike of this move.  It's just plain awful.  I want that part of my life to live over again, preferrably doing something less painful, like sticking white-hot needles into my eyes, or getting an extended colonoscopy. Seriously, don't let your kids watch this unless you can afford the therapy bills.

Well wait... There is one redeeming part to this DVD.  It's eco-friendly, since the disc makes a great coaster.  Please don't throw it in the landfill, there's enough toxic waste out there already.

No, I'm not exaggerating.  It's really THAT bad.  And I can stomach Tranzor Z! (Look it up.)",1324771200,,666,4.936936936936937
8093226,5,B000BVN0XW,"My children, ages 2, 4, and 6 absolutely LOVE the Alpha Bots Christmas video.  Yes, it's boring for adults.  But for some reason, my kids go bananas for this video.  They even prefer it to the Pixar films!",1308009600,,205,4.342105263157895
8093227,5,B000BVN0XW,"My neices and nephews loved it, and I have alot of them. I usually buy kids movies for them every year and have not gotten such a good reaction from them, as I have from this movie. The important thing is that the kids like it - more of a pre-school movie than anything.
I guess if I was to sit and watch as a movie critic, I would find spelling, counting or the alphabet painful but I'm not gonna diss a movie if my neices and nephews like it.",1290988800,,444,3.9444444444444446
8093228,1,B000BVN0XW,"The animated robots are well done, but they are superimposed over VERY low quality home video of a christmas tree and a house.  The Santa Claus has an obviously fake beard. The soundtrack is painful.

 The story is stupid. It's are robots that can be rechaged by being placed back in their cardboard box. How stupid do you think kids are?  The robots fly around and painstakingly spell out each letter of the alphabet.  It's brutal. Very depressing to watch.

Not worth further discussion.....",1200182400,,493,4.809523809523809
