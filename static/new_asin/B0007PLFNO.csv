8050278,3,B0007PLFNO,".is interesting. If you can play a foreign DVD you'll find the menu easy to navigate. The first screen gives you a choice of Deutsch or English (and English seemed to be auto selected) and from there you're all set (the usual DVD menu seems to come after the movie, it will be set according to your D or E selection I think). Full (square) frame picture, good quality picture and sound. For me (because I chose ""English""?) everything was in English, even the credits.
This ""movie' gave the impression of being intended as a TV series pilotthe pacing and hanging thread storyline bits will make you think the producers intended to make more stories. American and Australian casting (I think the mermaids were Americans, the bad guy I've seen someplace before). Set in Australia (?) they seemed to use U.S. currency.
The mermaids ""look"" is similar to H2O, just add Water or Mako Mermaids but instead of a bikini top the women had something that looked practically painted on. In a couple of scenes the viewer sees a ""nude"" mermaid in human form from the waist up, just a little more of the side of a breast than I'd expect in U.S. Teen television. The general story will probably be child safe, more mild violence than sex stuff, hardly any ""damn"" or ""hell"" stuff (not much of that).
The story of the three mermaid sisters avenging the death of their father would've benefitted from more time taken to tell it but mostly gets the job done.
Brittany Byrnes, Charlotte on season 2 H2O just add water, makes an appearance here an H2O fan might even like her better here.
An ""adult"" viewer might think the movie is somewhat silly, an older H2O or Mako fan might like it.
Worth a try (you might want to preview the story for the younger viewers but they probably will be OK.",1500595200,,1767,4.5423197492163006
