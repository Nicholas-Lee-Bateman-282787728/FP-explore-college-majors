7891593,5,6305536880,"ive seen the toonami version if this show, and the uncut version is 1,000,000,000,000 times better. in this video you get to meet gene starwind and his young friend Jim Hawkings take adventures with a pirate girl Heilda to unlock the secret of an andriod girl: Melfina the navigtion system to the outlaw star. this video is a must buy!",997315200,2,335,4.6
7891594,5,6305536880,"I like Outlaw Star because it comes so close to famous Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop was at times dark and depressing. Outlaw Star is too, but it's in a more toned up version. It doesnt copy Cowboy Bebop, but it still works. The story is about Gene and Jim. To buddies who run a repair business and get bounties here and there. One day, they get a call from a girl named Rachiel. Later on, it is revealed that Rachiel is the most wanted woman in the galaxy, ""Hot Ice"" Hilda. After a chase scene with the Chinese Guild, they find themselves in a small barn where they meet, in a suit case. The beautiful Melfina. After getting her on the ship and escaping the Chinese Guild, they head for Blue Heaven. Here you cant fire a gun so you'd think your face. Wrong. When Gene, Jim, Melfina and Hilda check into a hotel, Gene and Hilda are woken up in the middle of the night by pirates. What I liked the most about this show is that Gene represnts what real men are like. Waking up at noon, making omlete tacos on a lazy morning. The dubs works very nicely. A must buy. And since you get a lot of depth on the video, its worth the money.",978652800,,1127,4.1506849315068495
7891595,4,6305536880,"Gene Star gets more then he bargained for when he agrees to protected a mysterious woman and instead gets space pirates on his back and a badass spaceship called Outlaw Star. While this does have it's advantages, it's questionable if they outweigh the disadvantages. A spaceship takes alot of money to keep in order, and good work is so hard to find.
Outlaw Star is a fun, rather comic book style anime with pretty good music, a decent plot, and amusing characters. It might not be all laughs but when it's not amusing you, it finds some other way entertain you.",977011200,2,562,4.574257425742574
7891596,4,6305536880,if you are unfamiliar with the world of manga and anime this is one of the best starting positions you could find to jump right in. It's a space aged comedy about the tale of outlaw and his crew of coragous yet psychopathic crew of mercenaries and cat girls. But iif comedy isn't your bag of tricks then you won't be disappointed either with the serirs being filled to the brim with fantasy and high flying action and fantastic space battle scenes.,967852800,,448,4.475609756097561
7891597,5,6305536880,"This has gotta be one of the greats that Sunrise has put out. Many people have speculated this series as a cheap Cowboy Bebop rip off, I would argue against this. I would totally recomend this to anyone who liked the  ""Matrix"" or ""MI-2"" it's got some great action in it, as  long as you don't mind ""Gundam Wing""'s uncut amount of swearing. I  definetly wouldnt recomend it to anyone younger than 13 though. Engaging  story, Awsome music, splendid animation, and wonderful Charachtar designs,  I just gotta say that Sunrise has put out another beutifuly rendered  Sci-Fi. I would give ""Outlaw Star"" two thumbs up!",961372800,,612,4.780952380952381

7891599,5,6305536880,"This anime has to be one of the best that i've seen. It has innovative artwork and mechanical design as well as an intereting plot. It's a bounty hunter anime with a happy-go-lucky bounty hunter and his sidekick kid  partner who go on a wild ride into space from their home planet after  getting involved with one of the mysterious pirate gangs that rules  interstellar space, so he has to get involved with an outlaw woman and a  girl found cryogenically frozen in a container, who just happens to be  hunted by the pirates. Just watch it.",952387200,,540,4.525773195876289
