You will enjoy the show if like sad or dark stories and provided that if you are not in a bad mood (If you are a Vampire Princess Miyu Fan) this show is more for you.
I especially liked the way they descriped each character in the show, no one seems as innocent as you seems.. ^_^
For 2 Disk at 6 ep each, this series can't go wrong.",992908800,,474,3.88659793814433

Anyways, I found this show very enjoyable to the extend if you are not in a bad mood when you watch it.  I don't know what kind of story you usually like, but the story for this show usually ends up in a bitter sweet ending.
With the price for 6 ep. per disc for 2 disc, this series can't go wrong.",992908800,,392,3.7804878048780486
1395803,5,B000055ZFM,"The vampire is certainly a popular figure in anime, spawing films from Vampire Hunter D to series like Vampire Princess Miyu.  Though the ideas and stories of NightWalker are not exactly original, the anime OAV (direct to video) series is rather cute and entertaining.
Eternal Darkness is the second DVD (containing episodes 7-12) of the NightWalker OAV series.  For readers unfamiliar with the series itself, here are a few quick details:
Private eye Shiro's secret is that he's actually a vampire, but one who has taken on the task of defeating the creatures of darkness in a futile quest to redeem the fall that transformed him to a vampire--viewers may find this similar to television's Forever Knight.  Created by a powerful vampire bearing the biblically-suggestive name Kain, Shiro also bears a sprinkling of Anne Rice.
Shiro's partner, paranormal cop Yayoi, offers her own blood to sustain him as the two must defeat the ""night breeds"" in a series of six related yet distinct episodes.  His ""kawai"" schoolgirl secretary Riho--though not immediately in on the secret--also finds herself caught up in the struggles between good and evil.
In this second DVD, Shiro's sidekick Riho has herself become a vampire.  Though Shiro himself did the deed to save her ""life"" when vampire progenitor Kain had mortally wounded her, Riho now must learn to deal with eternal darkness.  The stories do a rather good job of characterizing the difficulties Riho faces adjusting to her new life while remaining true to the spirit of the first six episodes as Shiro & company must battle the evil night breeds.
As before, what really drew me into the series was the characters, as at times the stories themselves are somewhat cliche.  When in the final episode Riho apparently has turned to evil and Shiro must confront and likely kill her, you'll sit on the edge of your seat trying to figure out how the characters will possibly recover and return to their (un)lives together.
The English voiceovers are passable, but most anime purists will prefer the Japanese with subtitles option.  The special features aren't incredibly detailed but do include scripts, an art gallery, character info, and production data.
I found that the cliches presented did not detract from the overall stories and came to rather enjoy the series as a whole.  There may be grittier or more involved vampire anime available, but if you're looking for something different in vampire anime, give NightWalker a try.",1050364800,18,2475,5.031784841075795

1395805,4,B000055ZFM,"This DVD contains nights 7 through 12 of the 'Nightwalker' series, tales of a Shido, a Tokyo vampire, committed to fighting creatures of spiritual evil called the nightbreeds.  Shido's companions in the quest are Guni, an 'urban fairy,' the newly mad vampire Riho, his assistant, and Yayoi the beautiful agent who provides her blood in return for Shido's help.  This second DVD is more introspective than the first (Midnight Detective) and reveals much of the interior motivations of the main characters.
Night 7 - 'A Mother and Her Son.'  Riho finds a small boy playing with a kitten in the park.  His mother, who refuses to let him even touch small animals, becomes the suspect in a series of animal mutilation cases.  In a moment of horror, Shido finds himself faced with a horrible choice.
Night 8 - 'A Soul Lost in the Darkness.'  Broken China draws Shido into the search for a young woman's grandfather only to find he isn't missing but one of the walking dead.
Night 9 - 'Someone Else's Face.'  In a grim tale of disfigurement and tormented guilt, we are told the story of the first meeting between Shido, Guni, and Yayoi.
Night 10 - 'Tears of an Angel.'  The unusual luck of a young schoolgirl alerts Shido to the influence of a nightbreed.  A quest for happiness leaves everyone with regrets.
Night 11 - 'A Witch in the Forest.'  Shido relives a contest of wills with Cain.  A woman trades her souls to stay young for her absent lover as Shido struggles to find the road to redemption.
Night 12 - 'Eternal Darkness.'  Cain returns for real as Shido is forced to confront his own feelings for Riho.
As you can see, the material in this DVD is darker than the previous series.  The stories turn on the more bitter and sorrowful aspects of human love.  Shido is more thoughtful than he was in previous episodes, and we are treated to a good deal of insight into the motivations of Riho and Yayoi.  This adds surprising depth to what originally appeared to be a fun but lightweight series.  One has to admire has to admire 'Nightwalker' for both its stylishness and its efforts to transcend the traditional blood and violence of anime vampire stories (not that that is necessarily bad).  Hopefully we will get another change to visit Shido's detective agency.",1033084800,11,2264,4.662468513853904
1395806,5,B000055ZFM,"My kids loved this anime.  However there is some sexual content, adult situations and graphic violence that is not appropriate for children under 17.

1395807,2,B000055ZFM,"Typical storyline of the beast in disguise, the little girl secretly in love, lurking evil plots... .  Reasonable animation and dub but an overall slow and uninteresting storyline.  Basically introduces a set of 2D characters and puts them into fight after fight leading toward a predictable climax.  See BioHunter for a much better monster story or Buffy the Vampire Slayer for a better twist on the whole vampire genre.",1008374400,,421,5.072463768115942
1395808,5,B000055ZFM,"This is the second (and last) DVD of Nightwalker, containing episodes 7-12.  Nightwalker is the animated, Japanese counterpart to US series like Forever Knight and Angel: the main character, Shido, is a vampire who tries to help people endangered by the Nightbreeds, demons capable of possessing bodies and stealing souls.  At the core of the series is a pessimism regarding ability of those drawn into evil to repent or be saved.  That the show ponders such questions sets it apart, and the difficulty the hero has in saving those around him creates real suspense: the viewer doesn't know who might be saved and who might die.  The show is largely episodic--in most episodes, Shiro assists police officer Yayoi in solving a Nightbreed related crime.  The relationships between the main characters are constantly evolving, however, and everything is fairly well wrapped up in episode 12, while leaving room for future sequels.
Although this isn't really an action series, there is fighting and, occasionally, some really nasty gore--as well as a little nudity.  The show was aired late at night in Japan, and the content reflects this; in addition, the quality of the animation suffers some due to the small budgets such shows have.  The character designs, by contrast, are very attractive.  The English dub is among the best for a CPM/US Manga Corps title; only a few incidental parts are lackluster.  So, while this isn't a showcase of high budget animation techniques, it is a well-written show with interesting characters and a thoughtful (even philosophical) side which sets it apart from other vampire stories.",994982400,11,1616,5.114068441064639
1395809,5,B000055ZFM,"Although I have yet to purchace this video, I did rent it and loved it very much.  Good gothic vibe.  If you want to buy your first vampire anime, this and the first DVD is the one.",994896000,,181,3.864864864864865
1395810,4,B000055ZFM,"NIGHTWALKER: Eternal darkness is the second half of the 12 episode series first presented on DVD in NIGHTWALKER: Midnight Detective. This series aired on Japanese television in 1998. It revolves around Shido, a vampire whose human heart is in control, who acts as a private detective and fights to protect humanity from the demonic ""Nightbreed"" who are emerging in modern day Tokyo.
Shido has long lavender hair and an 18th century style of dress. He can manipulate and solidify his blood into a sword or even a rope to aid him in his missions. Shido is assisted in his fight by Yayoi, a beautiful detective who brings in the cases (and acts as Shido's voluntary meal provider), Riho, an orphaned high school student who lost her parents to the Nightbreed, and Guni, a small ""urban fairy"" who flits about and adds commentary to every situation. (Incidentally, in the Japanese version, Guni's voice is provided by Ikue Otani--Pokemon's PIKACHU.) Shido's evil vampiric sire Cain also appears, and tries to persuade Shido to rejoin him (a la Lestat and Louis in Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire).....Cain even declares his love for Shido in one of the episodes.
This second set of episodes is somewhat less predictable than the first six. This time around, Riho has become a vampire (which actually happened on the last DVD volume), we learn how Yayoi had a twin and how Shido came to meet both she and Guni, there is a mystery with a single mother and her child, a guardian ""Angel"" who lives for only one girl, a flashback story with a Witch, and a story in which Riho ""turns to the dark side"".  All in all, the second volume improves upon the first with more action, a little gore, and a whole lot more characterization.
Although this series is treading on somewhat familiar territory, I still found it to be very entertaining and I was not happy to see it end. If you liked Wicked City or Vampire Hunter D, you might want to give this series a chance. Although it's not as evenly good as those two films, you might be surprised at how much you might enjoy it.",993168000,8,2065,4.64207650273224

The dub is forgettable, sadly, but the music is still great. These episodes are more of a story-of-the-week deal, which occasionally delve into the protagonist's past.

7931566,5,B000055ZFM,"I Love Night Walker, it is one of the stories that 1st inspired me to become a paranormal writer. I love that Night Walker is open to idea of gore, blood, sex, and horror. I am often surprised that a show pre-True Love was allowed to have such graphic violence in it.

The voices are great in both English and Japanese and the translations are very spot on in English which is very rare. The story is filled with tear jerking scenes and the levity of comedy that it drastically needs. I wouldn't suggest this story for the faint of heart.

I found Night Walker when I was fourteen by mistake. It was in the anime section of the block buster and I wanted to upset my mother by getting something that looked dark and disturbing.

After watching it I was head over heels in love with the series, so much so that I purchased the series right away. Not an episode passed that wasn't action packed, and that 90% of them were so emotional and filled with beautiful sorrow that I cry. The episode with Yayoi and her sister is my favorite, I cry for most of it and the moment it ends I have no writer's block and write the most amazing scenes on my novels.

It is something I can watch all the time and it isn't a typical vampire story at all.",1367280000,,1234,4.216101694915254
7931567,4,B000055ZFM,"I was delighted to stumble across this older, but still quite fascinating anime, which surprised me so much with it's daring and thoughtful Vampire Tale that I was willing to pay extra for the entire 12 episodes.

[For some inane and annoying reason, you will most likely have to get this short, 1 season anime on two different DVD's, the first six called, ""NightWalker: Midnight Detective"", and the last six named, ""NightWalker: Eternal Darkness"", and neither of them always easy to find. And to make things even more confusing, there is a really rare DVD release with the entire series, as well as video tape releases with different titles--such as, ""NightWalker: Prescription""--giving the impression that there are more than just the 12 episodes.]

Although I'm uncertain of when it originally aired in Japan, the general style would indicate it was before ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" arrived on American TV. This makes it even more of a surprise, since it brings forth some Vampire-related story ideas that were not all that common until the days of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"", such as a Reformed Vampire working as a Private Detective, humans who are his friends, and a broken relationship with his Vampire Sire [shades of ""Forever Knight"", which it may also pre-date.] And all with just enough angst to keep it interesting, but not too darkly brooding. There's even moments of gentle humor.

Oh, and if you need another reason to give this one a try, Shido, the Vampire Hero, is voiced in English by Richard Cansino [under the name of ""Vincent Hatcher"", one of his older psuedonymns], who is best known for being the English voice actor for Kenshin, of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" fame. And the two-DVD set I bought also came with a subtitled version of the original Japanese, if that's what you prefer.

A mild warning however, for some bloody violence, bad language and slightly naughty nudity, as well as adult themes--This is not really a series for anyone under 13.",1245369600,,1959,4.909365558912387
7931568,4,B000055ZFM,"This disc contains episodes 7 to 12.  This continues the tale of a vampire detective Shido as he fights crime and keeps his newest child of the night out of trouble.  Like the first DVD it has tons of extras.  And like the first episodes there is violence and nudity so this is not for kids.  So if you enjoy evil witches, kind-of-evil angels and other horrors that go bump in the night THIS is the anime for you.",1189987200,,413,4.189873417721519
7931569,5,B000055ZFM,"Way back when, my friend was telling me about an anime series.  ""It's pretty cool!"" she said, ""The main character is a vampire, and he has this cute little fairy partner!  It's called Nightwalker!""  She didn't give me a very detailed plotline, but she had only seen one or two episodes.  Anyway, I forgot about it for a week or so, until one day I saw it and decided to pick it up.

I was not disappointed.  I ended up watching the second DVD first by accident, but oh well.  I don't know why people keep calling this anime series clichd...it's not.  There are some parts that are, but that didn't really detract from the series.  There are a bunch of original things to enjoy as well though.  For instance, I thought it was truly unique that the vampires could make weapons out of their own blood.  Shido has a sword, and Cain has a whip.  Well, actually they can both use either one, but they usually stick to their respective weapons. Also, I like the little detail that their eyes can change gold when they're in full ""vampire mode."" (No, that's not what they actually call it.)

Another original aspect is the breed.  The breed are both similar and different than vampires.  A few differences are that the breed don't come with bodies...they have to possess a human.  They also feed off of human energy rather than blood.  Shido has made it his quest to destroy the breed, even though vampires and the breed are usually comrades.  Together with Yayoi, his blood donor and partner, Guni, an urban fairy, and Riho, his young secretary, he sets out to save humans from them.

The best part of the series though, in my opinion, is definitely Cain and his relationship with Shido.  Cain is Shido's sire, and he's deeply in love with him, though Shido doesn't return the feelings.  His quest in life is to get Shido to return to him.  In the second DVD all the characters get remodeled... Cain was rather ugly in the first DVD, but in the second one - wow!  He's simply gorgeous.

The opening is one of the coolest openings I've ever seen in any anime so far.  The song they play is Gessekai, and it's a beautiful song.

If you're bored of the usual in vampire movies and anime, check this one out.  It's definitely refreshing, and the only bad part is that it was too short!  It'll leave you wanting more.",1125619200,9,2305,4.44976076555024
7931570,4,B000055ZFM,"Many many people will tell you that Nightwalker is one of the more clichd Vampire anime's out there. And it is. All the standard vampire rules apply. If you're buying the second disk, then I'd assume you've seen the first and enjoied it so I don't have to talk you into loving it. In this disk you see more of Shido's past and Riho's new life as a vampire is explored.
I'm not sure about other people's experiences, but I found some of the colouring and a couple of other aspects changed as the series progressed. My other big whinge is that there's not enough of it! I could have very happily watched quite a bit more of this one :)",1080950400,5,633,4.239669421487603
