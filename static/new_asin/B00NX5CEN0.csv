6684159,4,B00NX5CEN0,"This is a gift for a person who LOVES Pavarotti.  I have not seen or heard the dvd yet; however, from the list of performers on the cover it should be a great dvd to watch and listen to while relaxing.  I actually meant to purchase the CD, oh well, next time.  It arrived on time without any problems.",1419120000,2,301,4.067796610169491

8680919,3,B00NX5CEN0,"so/so.  Pavarotti had one of the finest lyrics tenor voices of all time.  Too bad he didn't remain as handsome when he was young.  An egotist who decided that he knew better than the composer when to change notes so that he could outshout the soprano, especially in the love duets of La Boheme and Madama Butterly.",1435276800,2,314,4.473684210526316

8680921,4,B00NX5CEN0,"Although, with one exception, I do have all the complete operas from which these duets are excerpted, especially, at this price, it is convenient to have just the big duets all in one fell swoop.
I don't know how often I will have the time to play back the complete operas but every once in a while, it will be so easy to just replay these great passages.
A lovely shortcut to enjoy great Pavarotti moments, not to mention his outstanding partners.",1426204800,5,448,4.475609756097561
8680922,4,B00NX5CEN0,"Some folks exist in the past as far as opera is concerned. While I normally tend to the present ""golden age"" of opera performances, with Hi Def and surround audio, I confess to a fondness to singers long gone, mainly because I saw them perform, and had the chance to meet some of them, one of whom was Luciano Pavarotti.

This disc brings about 90 minutes of Pavoratti singing duets with the likes of Joan Sutherland, Leona Mitchell, and Renata Scotto. The performances are from opera tapes from the 1980s - 1990s. There are obvious issues with the tape to disc transfer, and the sound is a bit less in quality than one is used to today.

But the performances themselves, gentle reader, are well worth the modest price of the disc. Sutherland is well past her prime, but still in marvellous voice. Ditto the other sopranos. Pavarotti is spendidly himself, with an unmistakeable sound. modest acting skills and a great, if hammy stage presence.

Anyone who is interested in Pavarotti should ""run, not walk"" to the keyboard and latch on to this beauty. Modest issues with disc quality take away a five star rating, but it's still a winner!",1422403200,6,1137,4.675
