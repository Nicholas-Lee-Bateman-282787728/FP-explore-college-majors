4990484,5,B006HLBBD6,A Beautiful Soul was absolutely worth my money and my time.  Never lose your Faith.  Well written and it makes you re-evaluate your purpose.  I've watched it several times since I purchased it.  I would definately recommend this movie.  In fact I'll be ordering more for birthday presents.  Enjoy All!!!,1358208000,,303,4.96
4990485,4,B006HLBBD6,"I liked it.....my kids did not, they said it was predictable.  I did not think so....I think it was a relief to see a clean movie that taught a lesson ""Don't gain the whole world and lose your soul""",1357257600,2,198,4.076923076923077
4990486,4,B006HLBBD6,"This movie was pretty decent. It had some great music, and the quality was good as well. The story was somewhat predictable, but now days what movie isn't? I am a movie buff so I pretty much can follow any movie & figure out the plot within the first 10-15 minutes. However, this was a good movie. The acting in it was solid as well as the cast. I give it a 4/5 stars because I did enjoy it.",1356912000,,391,3.962025316455696
4990487,1,B006HLBBD6,"I am a hugh Deitrick Haddon fan. I listen to his music almost non-stop. I ordered this DVD and checked my mailbox everyday in anticipation. It did not take Amazon long to deliver it. This movie sucked. It had a predictable plot- rock star almost dies. Then he goes through the same senario of seeing his life as it could be. He sees the errors of his ways, wake up and is a changed man to live happily ever after with the girl of his dreams. At times it was so hard to understand the parts that people were saying due to poor pronounciation. If I could I would get my money back",1351641600,2,578,4.123893805309734
4990488,4,B006HLBBD6,"This movie was a great reminder of God's power to grant second chances and his reminder that this life is not about us. In the end, it is about what we did in his name that counts and in his name, it's always about LOVE!",1349740800,2,220,3.911111111111111
4990489,3,B006HLBBD6,"I enjoyed the movie because I'm a fan of Deitrick, but the sound was a little muffled.  The picture wasn't totally clear in the beginning, but cleared up towards the end.",1348531200,3,170,4.483870967741935
4990490,5,B006HLBBD6,I just ordered this movie from here and cant wait to see it. I am a HUGE Deitrick Hadden fan my comment is for the one above. I believe everyone is entitled to their opinion but did you really have to give away the movie. You may not like mega church and that is fine. I belong to a mega church and regardless if your church is mega or small we ALL are SUPPOSE to be living for God...I am still going to buy the movie regardless of some people who tried to ruin it for others.,1345939200,4,476,3.917525773195876
4990491,3,B006HLBBD6,"**PLOT SPOILERS**

Dre (Deitrick Haddon) is an entertainer who looks and sounds like a low budget ""Prince."" In this film he is also a player and goes to church on a lost bet to his childhood friend Chris Scott (Robert Ri'chard) who is part of his entourage. While at church he tries to pick up Ariel (Lanisha Cole) and ends up disgusted as this mega-church only reinforces the negative stereotypes.

Once some of the characters are established, Dre gets robbed by his own security people and shot. During this time he has an out of body ""Christmas Carol"" type of experience which leads us to the expected ending.

African-American spirituals are not on my favorite film list. If they are on yours, you might rate this one 4-5 stars. The acting was forced and didn't seem natural, perhaps because of the water downed dialouge. The music was good, what little there was, with Dre lip syncing. He could kiss a member of the audience and not miss a note. There is also the unbelievable aspect...who carries $50,000 in cash to pay an artist? My biggest criticism of the film is that it endorses the mega-church idea, same as the film ""Brother White."" If you like mega-churches (and I don't) then these films are for you.

PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, sex, nudity, or n-words. Deitrick Haddon using pick up lines. Women in bra/panties in bed on the morning after.",1345939200,12,1356,4.684873949579832
4990492,4,B006HLBBD6,"I saw this movie in the theater thinking it would be just like his other movie Blessed and Cursed, but he took things in a different direction.  I think this one was a little better than the aforementioned, whereas the former seemed more like a very long music video that was intended to promote his next CD, this seemed more like a real movie with only one or two VERY LONG music scenes.  Although it did have a small amount of profanity and showed a lot of skin in one of the performance scenes, it didn't feel nearly as compromising as watching a typical Tyler Perry movie.  I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 because if you've seen ""A Christmas Carol"", you've seen this movie. Although the story line is kind of predictable, I'd still say watching this movie is a nice way for Deitrick Haddon and gospel music fans in general to spend the afternoon.",1336176000,7,857,4.4113924050632916

4990499,2,B006HLBBD6,My only real problem with this movie is there was no clear gospel message given in it. How can you have a moving about God and being redeemed but fail to give the gospel?,1395273600,,170,4.029411764705882

4990502,2,B006HLBBD6,Disappointed in the  overall content.  I expected much more than this from Deitrick. Hopefully his next one will be better.,1386201600,,123,5.1

4990507,3,B006HLBBD6,"I like D Haddon, so this movie was alright. The music was much better than the production.  The actors were good, but it was a little cheesy. Overall alright. Would I buy another one of his movies......YES!! I will support him, he's my bro!",1365552000,2,240,4.454545454545454

4990509,5,B006HLBBD6,When I first saw this movie and the title it caught my eye because I had just sent my husband a text message saying that I loved him because he ad a beautiful soul . So when I heard that song a beautiful soul it hit home. Insipring movie,1361664000,,237,3.857142857142857
4990510,3,B006HLBBD6,"This movies closest shot at humility was when his child hood friend kept him (Dre) encouraged, and never took it to heart when he was being put down fellow was the encouragement of the movie for those who were looking a little deeper. The songs were not as good as the ones from ""Blessed & Cursed"" with the exception of ""You Can Call Me King."" I felt like I was on a wanna-b pimp ride most of the time (and maybe that was part of what the producer was trying to show the audience). I couldn't  understand the red Aastro-boy phi sod Detrick Haddon used for this movie (it wasn't hype, it was hyper active).  The things that he said to people when they were really in need was like a family flashback....
I must admit that there was just as much skin stimulation in the praise dancing as there was in the carnal videos. Which spirit can you cause to rise when you swing your hair around wildly, while your entire torso minus breast are open and you are wearing super short-shorts, with a banging young body. I am not hating because I am a woman approaching my winter in life nor, am I interested in the alternative lifestyle. However, the beauty of youth is phenomenal and vivid once it is lost physically as you get older. But it should not be on display to the point you can almost see the color of the panties or the g-string when someone lifts up their legs to praise the lord.... This is not meant to be offensive -just candidly truthful.",1360800000,4,1441,4.333333333333333
