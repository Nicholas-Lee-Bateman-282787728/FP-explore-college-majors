8052694,4,B0007WFUOM,Very neat DVD that really tells a good story about how TV came about.,1490572800,,69,4.0
8052695,2,B0007WFUOM,"This was more of a biography than anything else. I was expecting they would show more evolution of television...from early stages from big boxes and small screens to small screens in small boxes to big flat screens. The BBC had a much better version in the ""The Secret Life of Machines.""",1398038400,,287,4.647058823529412
8052696,5,B0007WFUOM,A very compact and well-done summary of the history of Television. The compactness of the presentation holds the attention span of a general audience.,1397001600,,150,5.291666666666667
8052697,2,B0007WFUOM,"I purchased this to hopefully supplement my teaching of a Broadcast History course at the college where I am a professor.  Sadly this narrative contains not very good video examples and actually has inaccuracies concerning several aspects in the development of television from the mid 1940's into the commercial enterprise it became through the 1970s and 80s.

Empire of the Air and the segments of the PBS specials are much better.

Don't waste your money on this one.",1396051200,,469,4.987179487179487
8052698,5,B0007WFUOM,Very educational.  Contained lots of information and history.  Some of it we already knew but there was also some we didn't know.  We did enjoy it.,1378166400,,147,4.576923076923077
8052699,5,B0007WFUOM,"The fight to make success of the television was one of the most bitter battles in all business history.  The only thing bigger then the potential profits of Television were the EGO's of the men developing the standards and systems that would eventually bring TV to the majority of American homes.  Modern Marvels - Television: Window to the World was fast paced by painfully slow dull History Channel standards.  The early TV footage was really compelling.  The background and voice over was interesting and not dull.  I loved the pictures of the 1939 Worlds Fair always a bonus anytime I get to see Gotham at its very best.  I loved seeing references to the old Dumont Network and something I did not know.  I did not know the Dumont TV system had over 600 lines of resolution compared to the always crappy 480 lines of resolutions the jerks in Washington DC picked as the United States standard for television that lasted till the advent of HDTV!  You can always count on Washington DC cronies to choose the worst standards so long as the fat cats get their pockets lined with tons and tons of smackers!

I also loved how it made the battle for color TV easy to understand and fun to watch.  Again so long as you are not a real techie you would love this Modern Marvels - Television: Window to the World DVD because; it is just good enough to make sense of the birth of TV.  This would be a great thing to watch in a history class focusing on the 20th century.  The 21st century of High Definition TV was not even touched on or hinted at in this DVD so for DVD's chronicling the HDTV battles look elsewhere.  For what Modern Marvels - Television: Window to the World is I think the information is darn good, not great but solid good stuff.  Modern Marvels - Television: Window to the World  earned its FIVE STARS from this AUTISTIC WEREWOLF!",1357257600,2,1843,4.476047904191617
8052700,5,B0007WFUOM,This was a great Modern Marvels episode on Television. It covered more than any other show I've seen on early TV.,1267574400,,113,4.428571428571429
8052701,4,B0007WFUOM,"Modern Marvels - Television: Window to the World has loads of factual information along with amazing archival footage that kept my attention all the way through. The story goes at a rather quick pace although the major names in the development of television are repeated so often that you're sure to pick them up. There is interview footage with Walter Cronkite and a David Sarnoff employee and biographer; and I particularly liked the footage of the first televised signals even if they were crude images that needed much more technological refinement.

The DVD goes straight through the history of the development of television; and we are introduced to inventors and geniuses like Farnsworth who was awarded the patent for inventing television. Amazingly enough, David Sarnoff was quite the businessman and he was eventually able to outmaneuver Farnsworth and political figures to control the better part of television and its broadcasts. It's also great to see how they developed color television using a system partially based on the three colors of red, yellow and blue.

If I have any problem with this DVD it would be that the information does come at you rather quickly and I would have had trouble taking too many notes were I a student in school watching this for a homework assignment. It might also be uninteresting for a younger crowd although I myself enjoyed it. If you are a teacher considering whether or not to use this DVD in class, you may want to look elsewhere as this might not be the best choice for junior high school students or even high school students. This film has a lot of information at an almost rapid fire pace with plenty of important detail.

Overall, while I enjoyed this DVD very much I admit the information comes at you so fast that students might have a hard time taking notes properly to absorb all the pertinent information. It could also be too dry depending on the specific group of students you wish to show this to; but it's very well suited for adults and anyone else who wants an excellent introduction to the history of television and its development over the years.",1251417600,2,2118,4.7972602739726025
8052702,4,B0007WFUOM,"I teach an Introduction to Video Broadcasting class, and I have had trouble figuring out how to introduce the history of Broadcasting without completely boring my high school students. I like this program very much, because it focuses on the important aspects and summarized it for me. (Believe me, I have been searching for materials related to teaching Broadcasting for two years). My textbooks from my undergrad years as a Broadcasting major were way too detailed for the average high school student -- this video is perfect!",1251158400,7,528,5.080459770114943
8052703,1,B0007WFUOM,"The video contains many great facts about the invention of the television, but the delivery of these facts are horrible.  The description does not tell you that the video was created in 1996 and has the pacing of an old documentary.  I'm sure a newer video about the television would be better, but this video is a sleeper.  I could never use it in my classes at school.",1239148800,3,370,4.411764705882353
