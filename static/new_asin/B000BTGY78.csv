2440653,4,B000BTGY78,"For the person who asked about how many episodes you get

on All In The Family Season 5. I think It's 24 shows.

  Hope It Helps!!

2440654,5,B000BTGY78,"I remember watching this series when it was originally broadcast in the early seventies. Forced to watch this series with my dad, who loved this series, I remember the series through faint memories. Together with such other shows as the original Star Trek series and MASH, I never thought one way or the other for these shows until later on.

When MASH, All In The Family and Star Trek were being released by Columbia House back during the eighties, I had thought about getting those subscriptions but thought about it in the long run. Then, when MASH was released in Season Boxed sets I was excited. For too long I passed on purchasing these AITF sxets because of the high price tag which was attached to each set. However, ini the past year we all saw price drops in these sets and Best Buy's recent sale during their ""Buy 1 Get 1 Free"" offer I thought I'd share some tender moments during my viewing of this Season Boxed set. While I've read reviews that were less than mediocre I have to firmly disagree. I have watched through the first half of this set and not only is the picture quality crystal clear but there were no visual defects in any of these episodes.

I've come to revisit my childhood with this series and while Archie Bunker may be controversial as everyone's favourite loudmouth, Carroll O'Connor is in top form as the lead roll in this series. Carroll O'Connor is one of the finest actors in the business and he'll always be remembered for his role in this series. Some of the best comedic one-liners can be found in this series and the writing is even better than the writing on Seinfeld.

This is a highly recommendable TV Set that every fan of the classic TV Show genre. If you're a fan of Gilligan's Island and those earlier TV Shows you need to pick up this series.",1137715200,3,1791,4.487730061349693
2440655,5,B000BTGY78,"Okay, I haven't actually purchased the fifth season of ""All In the Family"", but what I need to know before I do is how many episodes does it contain? Is it the standard 24? This info would really help. Thanks!",1135555200,2,209,4.25
2440656,3,B000BTGY78,"They do not let you change the star rating on edits, so my relief will have to do; this show looks a lot better than Season 4. Gone are those red stripes that make the skin appear purple. Sadly, the transfer still has bit of haze on it but at least the colors remain consistant.

As for the show, even THIS is better than Season 4 (so far!). I actually had my doubts. I had just kind of assumed once a show begins even a slight decline a landslide is not far behind. The writers really seem to have picked it up again. The ""friends and neighbors"" aspect that crippled last season is kept more low key, and while I'm only halfway through, thankfully the Frank Lorenzo character has not been seen (dislike him). The Jeffersons are featured more, which is a good thing, and while I'm somewhat indifferent to Irene she really made a great showing in the Archies Helping Hand episode! I must also point out the Stretch Cunningham character seems like the worst Ed Norton rip-off I've ever seen, thankfully he is kept to a BARE MINIMUM.

I've always seen the packaging for this series as competant but nothing amazing. I like the color scheme here in S5, the ""evergreen"" is nice. The only real downer here is that are really only 23 episodes when you figure the 100th as being a Flashback affair, still this season has rekindled my love affair and has actually made me anxious for Archie Bunkers Place Season 1, which releases Jan 31/06. I would prefer AITF S6, but I'll take Archie any way I can get him.

4.5/5 (My new and improved rating for Season Five)",1130544000,,1551,4.435087719298245
2440657,5,B000BTGY78,"In the 1974-75 season of All In The Family,the fifth,two couples are ""moving on up"". Well,one is. That's Louise(the late Isabel Sanford) and George Jefferson(Sherman Hemsley) with their college student son Lionel(Mike Evans)in tow. Last season,Lionel celebrated his engagement to his longtime girlfriend Jenny Willis. In this season(I incorrectly mentioned this in the season 4 review),there's one episode where Lionel ""moves in with"" the Bunkers after he and George have a heated argument about Jenny. Another is a prelude to the Jeffersons,where only,from the original AITF cast,Edith(Jean Stapleton) is seen. She and Louise are embracing each other minutes before the Jeffersons' big move to Manhattan after George's drycleaning business,Jefferson Cleaners,yielded a financial windfall. We see in that episode,the rest of the Jeffersons cast,Zara Cully as George's mother Olivia ""Mama"" Jefferson,Franklin Cover as Tom Willis,Roxie Roker as Tom's wife Helen,Berlinda Tolbert as Jenny and Paul Benedict as the Jeffersons' English neighbor Harry Bentley(George thought he was weird although he is a ""honky""). ""I picked this place out,I'll conduct the tours."",mentions George to the Willises. Harry's back was acting up and required George's help to ease the pain. So George,rhythmically stands on Harry's back. Clips from this episode are seen in the Jeffersons episode GEORGE & LOUISE IN A BIND from The Jeffersons Complete Fourth Season. So the Jeffersons,moved out the Queens home,previously occupied by Jim Bowman(the late pre-Frank Lorenzo Vincent Gardenia). The Jeffersons moved into Bowman's former home in one first(AITF) season episode. After the Jeffersons left,Archie's(the late Carroll O'Connor) and Edith's ""little goil"" Gloria Stivic(Sally Struthers) and her ""meathead"" husband Michael(Rob Reiner) moved in. Michael was so relieved of the agony of differing with Archie and his(Archie's) demeaning and often infuriating remarks. Being next-door neighbors didn't prevent that from happening again,however. Archie and Edith were regular visitors to the Stivic household. Archie even ""had his own chair"" in the Stivics' house just like he has in his own house. Also,the Stivics' welcomed a son Joey. Joey was delivered by the same doctor who delivered Gloria when she was born. Of course,previously,Gloria had a baby shower. Archie was in costume when he went to the hospital to meet his new grandson. He was in blackface and scared the hell out of another female patient who was a long-haired blonde like Gloria(Archie thought she was Gloria). Also Mike and Archie have a contest to see how long Michael can go without food and how long Archie can go without cigars. The other episodes are awesome. The Jeffersons stayed on for 10 1/2 years after the move from Queens to Manhattan. The spinoff won a multitude of Emmys,one being Sanford's Best Actress Emmy from 1981. After Archie Bunker's Place,another AITF spinoff,got cancelled in 1983,the Jeffersons were still on the air. I think,also this season,the Bunkers' neighbors Irene(Betty Garrett) and Frank Lorenzo were gone.",1130544000,7,3086,5.568085106382979
2440658,5,B000BTGY78,"All right! I've been waiting a LONG time for this one. This is the season where George and Louise Jefferson will ""move on up"" to the dee-luxe apartment in the sky. Those of us who were only 2-1/2 years old when this episode originally aired will now be afforded the opportunity to see it in it's original CBS broadcast entirety! Of course, the pilot for ""The Jeffersons"" is not at all the only good thing that you will get if you buy this season. ""All in the Family"" was still in fine form at this point with all original players intact, fussing and fighting their way through all kinds of situations and keeping you well entertained for hours upon hours!

Hopefully the glitches that plagued the Season 4 set will not be present here, but if they are bear in mind that videotape does NOT age well. With or without the minor imperfections, we should just be grateful to get our hands on this uncut TV classic in a format that will not deteriorate any further than it already has. It definitely beats the hacked-to-pieces versions that TV Land airs! It's nothing short of shameful how much of the show has been removed over the years to make room for so many more commercials than it was meant for! Supporting these box sets will give the studio faith to keep them coming, and eventually those heavily edited syndicated versions will be made obsolete.",1130371200,27,1350,4.555555555555555

2440675,3,B000BTGY78,"Even if I hadn't known some of the background of Archie's absence from nearly 3 entire episodes, I'd still have noticed the sudden dip in the quality of the writing and the pacing of the episodes. I should point out that I saw these episodes during their initial run and repeatedly in reruns and, after a lapse of 15 years or so have started to revisit the seasons on dvd in chronological order- and have been enjoying them SO much. While I can accept that the reason for Archie's ""gone missing"" would have resulted in hastily-rewritten/adjusted scripts and a cast having to make do without a key player, it's painful to watch. Especially Gloria and Mike's bickering during the absence, which suddenly seems forced and awkward. Then there's the introduction of one of the most disappointing recurring guest characters, Stretch Cunningham, coming across like a very UNfunny (even if that's the point, but, this point worked when Archie was quoting the unseen Stretch's jokes) poor man's Ed Norton. To think the powers-that-be were considering killing the Archie character and having Stretch MOVE INTO THE BUNKER HOUSEHOLD? I shudder to even imagine it. However, focusing on the start of the season, it was a very bold move to have three episodes focusing on the impact of inflation on the average family and working person. Where other shows might stop at, say, having Mary Tyler Moore rolling her eyes and she tossed a tray of meat back onto the shelf after seeing the price, AITF really and truly got into it, to the point where watching these now after so many years brought back some pretty bleak memories of my childhood and the effect of inflation on my own parents. There's an ever-so-slight softening of Archie beginning this season. He manages to- begrudgingly- apologize, ask for advice and even declare love within his household more than ever. Edith's occasional standing-her-ground moments ring truer here and aren't accompanied by diminishing references to her erratic bout with menopause. One crucial aspect of AITF which truly shines throughout this season is the writers/producer's ongoing refusal to allow plots about serious issues to be resolved neatly at the end of an episode, or even a multiple-part storyline. For example; Archie's going back to work is overshadowed by the questionable long-term wisdom of the union settlements. But, let's face it, it's entertainment and, at its best, with its usually-deft shifting from disappointment to humor and back again, when it's funny it's laugh-out-loud funny. And, despite the success of Archie-light episodes from previous seasons, it's clear that Archie is ESSENTIAL for that laugh-out-loud quality. Carroll O'Connor- whatever his agonizing over his performances- was a MASTER at delivering a serious reaction with an ironic humorous chaser.",1479772800,,2812,5.155361050328228

2440746,5,B000BTGY78,"The fifth season of ""All in the Family"" was the one in which, in my estimation, the cast really hit its stride. It may be the best season of them all. It's hard to single out any one episode as the best, but here are a few of my favorites:

""Where's Archie?"" and the following two episodes. This three-parter revolves around Archie's leaving for a lodge convention in Upstate New York and never arriving. Meanwhile, Mike and Gloria try to keep the news from Edith as long as possible. When she finds out at the end of the first episode, she bursts into tears. Meanwhile, Mike and Gloria go through a box of Archie's mementoes, figuring that they may contain a clue as to his whereabouts. From what they find, they conclude that Archie has run off with Mildred Turner, a young, attractive blonde who works in the office at the loading dock. This turns out to be a mistaken hypothesis, which becomes evident only after some memorably funny dialog with Ms. Turner. It also leaves the question unsolved as to Archie's whereabouts. Finally, Archie comes back at the end of the third episode, with an unbelievable story (but accurate, as it turns out) as to what happened to him.

""Archie and the Miracle."" Archie ""gets religion"" after he escapes by inches being hit by a large falling object on the loading dock. He vows to attend church every Sunday and help out in the church where he can. Needless to say, his commitment quickly wanes, particularly when the pastor asks him to drive the bus for the elderly.

""The Jeffersons Move up."" This is the episode where the Jeffersons move from the house next door to their luxury apartment in Manhattan and thus are officially spun off to their own show.",1375401600,2,1694,4.602649006622516

2440755,3,B000BTGY78,"This was an interesting season in that it seems to tie up the beginning of the show and pave the way for changes.

While there were a few 2 part episdoes before, this 5th season had a 4 part episdoe (""Archie and Inflation"") and a 3 parter (""Where's Archie?"").

A real gem in this episdoe is ""Archie's Helping Hand."" He's tired of Irene and Edith running around together all the time. So he tries to (under the disguise of trying to help Irene) get her a job as an accountant at the loading docks. But his scheme back fires when she gets a 'fork lift job' working right with Archie.

NO DISRESPECT FOR CARROLL O'CONNOR INTENDED. One of my favorites in Season 5 was the 3 part ""Where's Archie?"" (Though part 3 is called ""The Longest Kiss."") On a trip Archie fails to call from the hotel he was suppose to. And everyone wonders what has happened to him. (Good combination of comedy, suspense, and some honest concern.) And with just a single line at the end of Part 3, Archie commands respect.

Without ruining it, this has an ending that combines comedy and honest joyful sentiment well. Making George Jefferson drunk so he could be nice to Louise and happy about Archie's safe return worked well. See if you can not feel any joy when everyone runs up to hug Archie. (Even George Jefferson)

Another gem is ""Amelia's Divorce."" Edith thinks her friend is so happily married, and she finds out how miserable her friend is, and that she is on the verge of divorce. Ironically, Amelia's 'soon to be x husband' ends up underlining Archie's good and redeeming points.

""Everybody Does It"" is also good. Edith, Michael, and Gloria point out to Archie that it is wrong to take supplies home from work. BUT, Archie shows Mike and Gloria that they aren't so innocent of what they are accusing him of.

Finally, in ""Mike Makes His Move,"" Mike and Gloria decide to move into the Jefferson's old house. (The Jeffersons of course earlier left for their own show.)

SIDE NOTE: While we get the impression that Archie is annoyed that Michael and Gloria will be next door, he does later seem to appreciate that. In Season 7's ""Mike the Pacifist,"" Mike and Gloria want to check out a house in the Bronx. And Archie tells them that they already have a perfectly good house next door.

2440756,5,B000BTGY78,"""All In The Family"" first premiered in 1970 and it managed to break all the rules of television. With a classic cast and scripts that exisited in real time, these weekly televised plays could have won PObies and Tony's on stages in New York. The terms that came out of Archie Bunkers mouth would shock network Cernsors today. Archie Bunker said things that Roseanne's censors would nerver let her say. (""Pitching a trouser tent"" indeed) Norman Lear tackled so many topics that remain current today and he did so using brilliant script writers and the finest actors alive at the time. (Jean Stapeltpon, an acteress with a high IQ, endeared herself to America as the very wise ""dingbat."" Always running, always loving.)

Watching ""All In The Family"" today brings about a whole new line of lessons: primarily that 40 years after the fact the only difference is that New York City is not as filthy as it was. (Mayor Guillianni shipped the homeless to the other four burroughs and mayor Bloomberg has shipped them to Jersey City and Newark)

I think that there's a bit more tolereance within the cities that lie on the coast-  but here in the Finger Lakes of New York there is just as much inbtolerance for ALL minorities as there was when Archie and Edith performed on WSaturday evenings back in the mid 70's.

The fifth season is particularly brilliant, taking on subjects that will cause you to realize that there was less a difference between Archie and Mike than we thought and that it would do us all very well to watch this series again today, given the way our white culture looks upon the ""minoriteis"" (this word doesn't mean what it used to) we could all enjoy and leadrfn froim ""All I n The Family"", one of the finest pieces of art ever made.",1299456000,,1748,4.610932475884244

2440758,5,B000BTGY78,"...the days of inflation and strikes, Lionel moving in, Archie going missing, the series' hundredth episode retrospective, ""fair fighting"", stealing from the workplace, the Jeffersons moving up and Mike finally graduating and he and Gloria making a move of their own. A nice season that still showcases some of the best comedy ever seen on sitcom television. In the fifth season the show was still a fan favorite, riding the wave of popularity it had established in the first season and built heavily on since the critically acclaimed second.

The fifth season contains the following 24 episodes:

The Bunkers and Inflation
Archie and Edith's 26th wedding anniversary coincides with worry that Archie's union will go on strike. Archie and Edith both learn of the strike separately and try to keep it from each other and their party guests.

The Bunkers and Inflation (2)/Archie Underfoot
With his union still on strike Archie is stuck at home trying to keep entertained. Meanwhile as family funds dwindle Edith tries to get the family by on a budget.

The Bunkers and Inflation (3)/Edith the Job Hunter
With Archie still out of work Edith and Mike both search for jobs. When Edith finally gets hired by George Jefferson Archie refuses to take his charity.

The Bunkers and Inflation (4)/Archie's Raise
Archie becomes a homemaker when everyone is working but him and he is at home alone all day. Then the strike is called off when his union gets an increased wage, but is Archie really better off?

Lionel the Live-In
The Jeffersons have been having loud arguments keeping the Bunkers up at night. When Lionel has had enough of George giving him grief about his girlfriend Jenny, who has mixed race parents, he moves in with the Bunkers and it's up to a fed up Archie to fix the relationship between father and son.

Archie's Helping Hand
With Frank Lorenzo so often away on work Irene Lorenzo has been around a lot lately. To get her out of his hair Archie attempts to get her a job as a secretary at his work but his plan backfires when she gets a job as forklift driver right alongside him on the dock.

Gloria's Shock
When Mike and Archie fight once again about national problems it is Gloria who is most shocked when she learns Mike doesn't want to have children.

Where's Archie? (1)
Edith prepares a speech for her first tupperware party while Mike and Gloria try to hide their concern over Archie not showing up at a union convention he is supposedly attending in Buffalo.
*As mentioned by another reviewer (and probably known by most reading this) this entire three parter was written when Carol O'Connor walked off the show. The writer's had a plan to kill off his character and have Stretch Cunningham move in with the family.

Archie is Missing (2)
With Archie still missing the family is concerned. Greater concern arises when Mike believes Archie could have run away with a woman from work named Mildred ""boom-boom"" Turner.

The Longest Kiss (3)
Archie finally sends news of where he has been and that he is coming home. While the family awaits his return (and the writer's kill time) Mike and Gloria try to kiss until he arrives while Edith, Irene, George and Louise end up having an impromtu party.

Archie and the Miracle
After a near death experience on the loading dock Archie has a new lease on life and vows to become a devout churchgoer, but attempting to follow through quickly finds him aggravated.

George and Archie Make a Deal
George has plans for his cleaning store and wants to run for Republican County Commission. When he needs Archie's signature on a petition first to convince other neighbours to sign he and Archie begin their bargaining.

Archie's Contract
Archie gets conned by a man who tells him putting aluminum siding on his house will be beneficial only for Mike and others to help him realize his mistake. Archie tries desperately to get out of the deal but in the end its his friends and family that come through for him.

Mike's Friend
When Mike's friend comes to visit Gloria feels treated as unintelligent when Mike won't include her in their conversations.

The Best of ""All in the Family"":
Henry Fonda hosts a look back at some of the best moments from the first 100 episodes of the series. A hilarious hour long special that showcases soem truly classic moments.

Prisoner in the House
Edith befriends a plumber's assisstant who also happens to be a convict in the work-release program. When Archie finds out about the man he becomes paranoid and feels unsafe leaving Edith or Gloria alone in the house with him.

The Jefferson' Move Up
Edith says goodbye to Louise Jefferson as Louise, George and Lionel all move on up to their deluxe apartment in the sky. Serves as a pilot for The Jeffersons.

All's Fair
Tired of feeling Edith is pushed around by Archie, Gloria convinces Edith to start ""fair fighting"". A process Gloria and Mike have been trying where they vent frustrations with each other respectfully. Things quickly erupt from there.

Amelia's Divorce
Archie's sunday is ruined when Edith's cousin Amelia and her husband Russel come to visit. Edith and Archie soon start to appreciate their relationship when they realize the poor state of Amelia and Russel's.

Everybody Does It
Archie 'borrows' some nails and a drill from work to build an overhang on the porch. He soon becomes the topic of a household debate on the definition of morality and then begins to worry Irene Lorenzo will turn him in to the boss.

Archie and the Quiz
A life expectancy quiz in a magazine has Archie rethinking his bad habits of drinking and smoking when he learns he is supposed to die in only seven years time.

Edith's Friend
Edith attends a family wedding without Archie only to run into an old family friend she was once smitten with.

No Smoking
Archie and Mike begin a competition to see who has more will power. Mike tries to go longer without eating than Archie can without a cigar.

Mike Makes His Move
After finally completing school Mike and Gloria are having trouble finding a suitable nearby apartment. When George Jefferson still needs to sell his house he offers it to Mike and Gloria at a reduced rate just to enrage Archie. After turning down the offer Mike eventually takes it when Archie provokes him.

A great season, though a much more mild one when compared to the previous three. Less actual controversial issues and more tame debates on morality, still hilarious and completely enjoyable though. If you've seen it and enjoy it the dvd is worth it, if for some reason you are new then I suggest you start with the second or third season to get a better feel for the show. The new snapcase sets aren't as nice as the original Sony digipaks but since Sony completely abandoned this property it's great that Shout! has picked it back up. Aside from that many studios now are repackaging their old releases in the new cheaper snapcase packaging (Fox has done so with King of the Hill and Family Guy as well as other properties), so there is no saying that had Sony finished what they started that they wouldn't have switched to this packaging as well.

Despite the snapcase you still get the same artwork and episode listing guide that you would have gotten to view with the digipak release. The audio and video are the same quality as watching the reruns on television, they are obviously old and shot on video but if you are a fan of this series you're likely used to the quality by now and even see it as part of the charm of the show. Five stars for the fifth season from me.

*For those interested in the behind the scenes controversy of All in the Family as showcased by Carol O'Connor's walk off during this season, I suggest the book Archie & Edith, Mike & Gloria: The Tumultuous History of All in the Family, it is a great read and is very informative, exploring how the series came to be through its entire run on television and beyond. Terrific.",1298592000,20,7914,4.6781857451403885
2440759,5,B000BTGY78,"""All In the Family"" continued to be America's highest rated series in the fall of 1974 with over 20,000,000 viewers watching the Bunkers each week. The events that happened off-camera on ""All In the Family"" were just as exciting as any of the scripts as Carroll O'Connor walked off the series, demanding a substantial pay hike. After a well-publicized feud with producer and creator Norman Lear, O'Connor returned to the show becoming the highest-paid actor, at that point, in television history.

 The fifth year began with a four-part episode entitled ""The Bunkers and Inflation"", which dealt with Archie being laid off from the dock plant and facing an unknown financial future. This is also the year the Jeffersons were spun off into their own weekly series. The pilot episode of ""The Jeffersons"" is included in this DVD set called ""The Jeffersons Move On Up"". There is also a wonderful retrospective show included called ""The Best of ""All In the Family"""" hosted by Henry Fonda that features clips from some of the most popular episodes in the series' first four years. The final episode from season five (entitled ""Mile Makes His Move"") deals with Mike and Gloria moving into the Jefferson's old house next door. This plot twist enables the conflict to still exist between Archie and the Meathead for more seasons to come much to the chagrin of Mr. Bunker who thought Mike and Gloria were going to move since Mike finally graduated from college.

 24 episodes are included in this set and like prvious releases no special features are included.",1292803200,2,1549,4.923371647509579
2440760,5,B000BTGY78,I am adding to my dvd library. I loved this show! I like to go back and get some laughs with Archie. Carroll O' Conner was a great actor.

2440761,5,B000BTGY78,"And for good reason.  All In The Family was just so well written and performed.  Issues they fight about are still around and it's interesting to see them discussed almost 40 years ago.  Just finished the one where Mike is explaining to a dumbfounded Gloria how aerosol cans destroy this thing called the ozone and the effects of that - this in defense of his decision not to ""bring children into this world"".  So many fantastic scenarios are played out with the pure soul that is AITF.  And speaking of ""green issues"" I just want to say that I am happy I went with this old edition which has the fold out case with a disc-holder for each disc and not the new single spool holder for all three discs.  This whole ""buy green"" movement by the DVD execs who want to save a few pennies on packaging is a scam.  Good DVD packaging isn't causing environmental pollution - no one throws these things away in the first place.  This is just a total hustle that should be seen through by intelligent buyers.  These so-called ""environmentally friendly"" plastic cases that you're seeing in DVDs these days don't protect the insert artwork as well and they damage a lot quicker than the standard cases which contain all the plastic that they should.  Just my two cents.  I'm so tired of seeing this ""go green"" scam in relation to DVD companies trying to chince out on quality packaging. End of rave.

Back to AITF, this 5th season is a total winner.  The 4th season was noticably weaker I found after having been through seasons 1, 2, and 3.  I was expecting the downhill turn to continue.  Not so.  I don't think the writing has ever been stronger.  Don't hesitate to get Season 5 if you love this show.  The writing is so good.  This is pure ease in television enjoyment.  Long live All In The Family.  I love this show.  And even beyond the comedic value of which there is much, there are almost as many moments of pure poetry - this show knew how to say something even beyond its comedy.

2440767,5,B000BTGY78,"NBC loves to hang the moniker ""greatest ____ ever"" on its TV shows as if saying so makes it so. First, The Cosby Show was the greatest sitcom ever, then Seinfeld, then Friends. Of course, according to NBC, ER is the greatest program in the history of television, so we all have to discuss comedy programs in and of themselves. If NBC spent nearly as much time creating good new shows as it does in shamelessly overhyping their old shows, they probably would still be ahead of CBS in the ratings.

For my money, no sitcom will ever top the great All in the Family in any respect -- acting, writing and overall influence. To get an idea of what dire straits TV comedy was in before All in the Family, take a look at an episode of one of the other sitcoms that was on the air at the time: Family Affair, The Brady Bunch, the last, sad days of Bewitched, The Beverly Hillbillies. The country had grown up, but television sitcoms had stayed rooted in the same dated themes of the 1950's and 1960's: either sterilized white bread families or gimmicky hocus pocus that took the place of the quality writing of classics like I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners and The Dick Van Dyke Show. Subjects like Vietnam, flower children, drugs, poverty, racism, homosexuality and rape were taboos.

Enter Archie, Edith, Mike and Gloria who dealt with all those issues and more head on in every episode. While Carol Brady scolded her children for saying the word ""stinker,"" Archie Bunker held a lengthy dissertation on the phrase ""god damn it."" While Samantha Stevens was still dealing with her wacky witch and morlock relatives, the Bunkers were coming face to face with a transsexual. While the perpetually backwards residents of The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction and Green Acres discussed barn dances and pig raising, the Bunkers talked about the bombing of Cambodia and Watergate.

To be sure, Archie Bunker was a caricature -- a personification of all the old time, outdated prejudiced values that were so out of step in the early 70's. Creator Norman Lear's political perspective is cleary on the side of Mike and Gloria Stivic rather than Archie or Edith. However, Lear, who modeled the character of Archie on his father, wisely gave Archie Bunker a good soul. It's clear that deep down, Archie is a good person who can't deal with the changes in his life and the country without lashing out angrily at them.

The supreme achievement of All in the Family is that it takes all that anger and controversy and makes them funny. In the episode where the Jeffersons move into the neighborhood, for example, Archie's bigoted opposition to letting a black family could have made the situation ugly and very, very unfunny. However, Archie's opposition and fear is lampooned, making the point that discriminating on the basis of race is ridiculous. It's certainly deeper and more meaningful than Soup Nazis or finding out which two members of the Friends ensemble will sleep with each other next.

In addition, the cast is probably the best ever assembled for sitcom with the possible exceptions of The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Carroll O'Connor as Archie, Jean Stapleton as Edith, Rob Reiner as Mike Stivic and Sally Struthers as Gloria are absolute magic together and still manage to convey how much they love each other even while they argue about and disagree about everything. In addition, the supporting cast would later include so many great actors and actresses as so many great characters that All in the Family would spawn five spinoffs. A true measure of how much the characters come to mean to the audience is in the episode ""Gloria's Pregnancy."" When Gloria miscarries, Archie goes to comfort her. Even though he can't find the right words to say, the look that passes between Archie and Gloria is extremely moving and touching. The characters yell and scream the most horrible things at each other, but when push comes to shove, they are a real, loving family.

No matter how much NBC and other networks may hype their sitcoms as being the best ever, All in the Family will always be king. The show made television grow up and meet the issues of the day head on while still making the audience laugh and care.",1167350400,5,4231,4.741847826086956

I don't think that many people really sit down and watch the shows and realize that Archie was a product of the times.  All that he learned was basically learned at home.  Carroll O'Connor was a comic genius and he ""made"" Archie be the success that he was.

2440773,3,B000BTGY78,"Or the age-old argument of ""keeping the toilet seat up"", for that matter?  But who'd expect Mike to drink caramelized fizzy sugar water that rots tooth enamel anyway?!

Season 4 saw some degredation of Mike, though given all the episodes where his point of view was glorified, it's only fair to have him cut down a little.  But Season 5 has less of Mike in general, more Archie (when he's not vanished to someplace else), more in-program product advertising (Tupperware, Coke, Pepsi, Royal Crown?!, and a couple others), a drop from hefty controversial issues into a more schticky sitcom antics...  and some rehashing of some old ideas, which is the most telltale sign of ""creative rot"".  The show has just about jumped the shark by now, yet is still teetering on its edge.  Indeed, Carroll O'Connor walked out from three episodes in a creative control dispute against Norman Lear; which also proved his character was necessary for the show to even work.  (though later seasons prove that without the politics and ensemble piece, the character of Archie is just as lifeless.  The show always had and always needed a motley collection of 'extreme' characters to BE funny.  And the dynamic has already been whittled down...)

Let's go over the better/best episodes first, in chronological order:

1.  Archie's Helping Hand:  Archie gets Irene Lorenzo a job at his plant, but then finds out she'd to work with him.  He then schemes to get her fired via a petition...  An otherwise typical episode, elevated by some anti-sexism philosophy.

2.  Gloria's ShocK:  Easily the BEST EPISODE in season 5 and better than almost everything season 4 came up with.  This one is in my Top 10 episodes also; something no season 4 story could accomplish.  Mike is adamant he does not want children, citing numerous ecological and population problems.  Gloria is just as adamant for wanting one, until she talks with Edith, whose charming viewpoint makes Gloria remember some more important things about herself...  This one is mostly accurate on population statistics and utterly correct on the ecological and population concerns.  (pity Mike changes (or loses) his mind in season 6, but that's another story for another day...)

3.  The Jeffersons Move Up.  More of a pilot for ""The Jeffersons"", it is reasonably entertaining and there's a lot of one-liners that never fail to induce a great laugh.  As for the Jeffersons, George, Louise, and Lionel are well cast - as are the goofy assortment of neighbors they have to deal with; you know right there and then it's going to be a winner of a series.  I'm looking forward to purchasing ""The Jeffersons"" in the near future.  (but I wouldn't mind seeing ""Maude"" come out someday too...  :)  But I digress.)

4.  Archie and the Miracle.  An accident on the loading dock nearly kills Archie, who in turn becomes a devout Christian.  Another solid episode involving a juicy topic.  Mike also chokes at the most opportune time too.  :)

5.  The Best of 'All in the Family'.  Given how this one is a clip show, a type of show I usually and utterly dislike, it gave me far more laughs in its hour than half of season 5's remaining episodes combined (the ones not in my ""best"" list here, that is!)  Indeed, this one being hosted by a cue-card reading Henry Fonda with piped-in applause soundtrack almost dampens the celebratory nature of the piece.  (Henry himself is cool; but the obvious use of applause and laugh tracks for his comments is not.  And his gaze unfortunately looks as if he's reading something just to the left of the camera lens...  :(  Too stagey.)

6.  All's Fair.  Mike and Gloria teach Edith how to demand respect from Archie.  (we've seen Edith demand respect before, but sometimes a rehash is a good thing.)

7.  Everybody Does It.  Rationalizing over nicking a pencil from work was never funnier.  Still, Mike made the argument in a season 2 (or 3) story regarding taking change left in a phone booth.  Still, everybody's in character and it covers an interesting topic.

8.  No Smoking.  Can Archie give up his ciggies longer than Mike can for food?  (I'm a sucker for this sort of plot.)

9.  Lionel the Live-in.  While this one seems a tad far-fetched, Archie and George make some outrageous comments (some of which are the typically funny ones), and Louise gets the best come-back zinger to George after he makes a multi-ethnic slur.  Awesome!!!  Definitely a top-10 moment!

10.  Prisoner in the House.  A surprisingly mature storyline that also deals with the real-life ramifications of having an inmate furlough work program.  Archie was totally out of line and shows how quickly stories become embellished.  Not the best story, but very good indeed and even-handed in its approach.

These episodes ensure this season gets anything more than 1 star, and ""Gloria's Shock"" and that lovely scene in ""Lionel the Live-In"" is how it gets up to 3 stars.

""The Bunkers and Inflation"" must be an in-joke, because it took FOUR parts to tell us that it's harder to live with inflation??  It's a nice idea and has some good set pieces, but by the next story it's as if inflation never existed!

""Where's Archie?"" is a three-part story consisting of nothing but empty pablum, I may as well watch (any given 1970s sitcom) instead.  ""Where's Archie?"" (pt 1) has the big Tupperware bash, complete with lengthy dialogue on how to properly use the containers.  Like Archie would say, 'Oh jeez!!'  Worse is in ""The Longest Kiss"" (pt 3) where it features another rehash; not for blatent product advertising, but re-using an older story's plot piece!  But this time it's not Archie determining if the spoon he's eating his Cocoa Puffs with is his World's Fair spoon or not.  It's if Mike can determine which brand of cola is which.  If product placement comes across naturally, I'm fine.  But this seems so badly shoehorned in... ugh.  Later seasons are more overt, however...

""George and Archie Make a Deal"" just doesn't ring true.

""Archie's Contract"" seems to have a theme regarding ""beware of door-to-door salesmen"", but the plot itself is too narrow and having too much fun insulting Archie (though there's nothing wrong with that, LOL!)

""Mike's Friend"" is another boring escapade; this time Mike is being overbearing and leaving Gloria out of activities he and his friend have.  This seems atypical for Mike; who has often treated Gloria like an intellectual equal in ther past...

""Amelia's Divorce"" is another sitcom episode and as the guy who played Frank left after season 4, they couldn't keep finding excuses for him to be gone.  So they got rid of him.  (Amelia ditches shortly after too...)

""Archie and the Quiz"" is another plot to be found in any sitcom; it may have been more ""controversial"" when it first aired, but it's dated badly.

""Edith's Friend"" vaguely reminds me of ""The Threat"" where Archie's old friend's new fling stops by and Archie ends up getting more on his mind than he should...  But it's not a bad episode.

""Mike Makes His Move"" has Mike and Gloria renting the Jeffersons' old house.  Which is next door, just to ensure we get more arguments and verbal tussles in later seasons.

Season 5, on the whole, isn't anywhere near as poweful as its first three.  There are some clunkers, ""average"" story quality is definitely toned down and more akin to a ""typical sitcom"" but with controvercial bits added.  The few stories that are ""old school"" in their overt nature (especially ""Gloria's Shock"") are easily the high point standouts, but it's clear the show has been - and will be heading - in a direction far different than how it originated, and not in a good way.  The political backbone being replaced with lovey-dovey sitcom pablum, with little bits of political moments thrown in.

Video and compression quality is typical to the other releases.

Sound seems to have more hiss than previous versions had.  Was the audio cleaned up at all?

Not a bad season on the whole, and in ways is preferable to season 4...  and the worst seasons (which oddly contain some of the BEST episodes) are to follow.  Worth the $20 price amazon.com wants.  But not more.",1139443200,21,8126,4.797687861271676
