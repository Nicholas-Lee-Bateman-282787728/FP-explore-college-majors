8311075,5,B001ILDEJY,"Just what can you say about this six hour plus DVD. Eclectic British rock and folk at its best, Medicine Head,Stack Waddy, Tractor/The Way We Live, Bridget St John, Kevin Coyne and Siren. Siren were apparently big favourites of Jac Holzman at Elektra. Tractor became massive on the festival circuit. thiss DVD is a m,ust fior music fans, disjointed and wacky like John Peels shows.",1293494400,,381,4.876923076923077
8311076,4,B001ILDEJY,"First music DVD I've ever had that has an actual duration of six (whew!) hours. I've never even heard of most of these artists although I've always know about the late John Peel and some of his work. Okay, first we get a twelve-minute intro, then the hour long performance of Kevin Coyne (musician, composer, film-maker and poet) with Siren - a bit similar to maybe Robert Wyatt, Kevin Ayers and Richard Thompson - ? - that's my guess. Then, you see Coyne's (R.I.P.) colleague - Dave Clague talking about working with him. Liked the short segment of Gene Vincent, as so the backstage interview with British rhythm & blues band Stack Waddy (gotta love that name) - also has the band in the studio - jamming - great harmonica playing. What do you know? There's even another bit of the duo Tractor, this time it's an indepth interview. Here's one I know I've never remotely heard of - the Principal Edwards Magic Theatre - which is a fourteen-member musical collective of musicians, dancers and poets. Their music is okay - if you're into the 'Fine Arts' scene. To close out this DVD, you get a dose of Bill Oddie, I was sort of taken with his pop tune Ozit had decided to include here on this DVD - as this performer is also considered a naturalist and artist as well (reminded me of maybe like a Joe Cocker wanna-be). Have to admit, Ozit puts out some diverse material on their various artist DVD's. Comes with a full color 14-page DVD booklet.

Forgot to mention the ninety (approx.) minute segment on Medicine Head - you get some of their music, with a decent photo collage + a live performance. I've actually heard of this band before - as they sort of maybe reminded me of Bob Dylan.",1288569600,,1686,4.49185667752443
