2939136,5,B000VEA3G6,My niece and nephew love this DVD series. It's real construction site footage (or whatever the DVD topic is) with voiceover giving the equipment personalities.  ABSOLUTELY GREAT!,1282089600,,178,5.592592592592593

2939139,5,B000VEA3G6,"OUR 5 YEAR OLD NEPHEW LOVES ALL OF THE MIGHTY MACHINE DVD'S. WE HAVE ODERED HIM 6 OF THEM AND HE STILL WANTS MORE . HE WILL SPEND HOURS WATCHING THEM. I NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT TO GIVE HIM AS A GIFT AS LONG AS WE INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE MIGHTY MACHINE DVD THEN HE THINKS EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIS GIFT PACKAGE IS ALSO GREAT.THE PRICE FOR THESE ARE REALLY AFFORDABLE WHICH ALSO ALLOWS US TO GET HIM SOME EVEN FOR NON BIRTHDAY,CHRISTMAS EVENTS ETC.",1237334400,,447,4.149425287356322
2939140,3,B000VEA3G6,"We got the DVD called Diggers & Dozers about tractors and construction from this set first and it was great. If I'd gotten this one first I probably wouldn't have purchased any of the rest of the series. I'm sure a lot has to do with your little ones interests and ours may grow into liking this one as he gets a little older. He was obsessed with tractors when he was tiny (18 mos) and has really enjoyed the tractor one and still asks for it even now at 3 and will continue to enjoy it for a good while. If your kid is into boats, water craft, or rescue this may be the one for them.",1214524800,2,585,3.9661016949152543
2939141,5,B000VEA3G6,"These DVDs are the best.  My kids love them, and they really enjoyed this DVD- the boats were great!

I highly recommend the entire series.",1199232000,2,269,4.680851063829787

2939150,5,B000VEA3G6,"My husband and I have purchased almost all of the ""Mighty Machines"" dvds. And this is just another one to add to the list of his favorites. We love the videos because they teach real stuff and not just show silly cartoon characters. And the dvds have been keeping his attention since he was 2 years old! They are worth every penny!",1305676800,,331,4.354838709677419

8218379,5,B000VEA3G6,"It's so hard to find these.  My son is ASD and our internet connection is not that strong so when we have Mighty Machines playing on youtube and our connection gets lost, it's torture.  I have to say having this and others as a fall safe is greatly appreciated for home and for travelling.  We had these for my other kids, but they were watched so often that eventually they just didn't survive the machine and boy-handling.  I was okay with the price just because sometimes we pay more to avoid a meltdown than we would for ""just another movie"".  I had him select the ones he wanted for his 3rd birthday (today) and they arrived as expected.  They were in great shape and no damage to the DVD.  He put them in and watched them for a few minutes and then switched off.  He's gone through them all and now can select the one he wants to watch.  My other ASD son was so excited to see them as well.  Great gift for that child that loves informational text and all the BIg and mighty machines they see out in the world.",1490054400,,1016,4.217616580310881
