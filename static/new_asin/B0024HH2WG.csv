3846818,3,B0024HH2WG,"This is a nice independent effort.  But it falls short of being a great independent effort.  The young actors make the most of the material.  The Director uses Fitzgerald's premise in an interesting but not fully realized direction.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch an attempt that almost makes the grade, but not quite, and then ask them to point out why.  I find myself unable to fully articulate the failure and I am still entertained and fascinated by the modern setting and actors.  It isn't a waste of money by any means and you may find my assessment wrong anyway.  But that's what independent film making is all about.  Taking the chance that your audience will come out of the studio box and go with you to a new place.  Watch it and tell me if you think they took us there.",1245888000,2,801,4.394557823129252
3846819,4,B0024HH2WG,"Plot: The story centers around a group of friends. Charlie- the quiet intelligent guy, his friend and another acquaintance named Mick who is working class and is known for his rebelliousness and the fights he gets into.

Mick is always getting into trouble and soon a pretty serious incident takes place on a roof in NYC. Mick beats up a couple guys and one ends up dying.

Cops investigate and Charlie isn't sure what to do considering what's on his conscience..

Soon Charlie is off to Vassar. All of a sudden Mick pops up there and he's living the high life with Charlie and his acquaintances.

Mick also starts integrating into high society and dating the girl Charlie is in love with, everything is going okay at first, Charlie and even Mick himself thinks he may just be changing his old ways... But there's a secret that is coming to a head and it's uncertain what Mick will do if he finds out Charlie knows..

Not bad for a directorial debut. I wasn't expecting much considering Fred Durst is the  singer of Limp Bizkit and I never really expected him to make any "" serious"" movies- but I have to say, this was surprisingly well done.

There was something about this movie that I really liked. I don't know if I can say Fred is "" gifted"" as a director but he just may be and this was a good start.

It wasn't perfect but it was a decent first effort and delivered in more ways than one.

The story could have been better but the guy has a gift for directing and setting the mood and ambiance of the scenes- He captured the era the movie was set in.

I have to say I would recommend this yet I can't exactly say why- It was different. It's worth seeing not just because of the story but because of Fred's talent as a director. 4 stars.",1245888000,2,1742,4.315950920245399
3846820,3,B0024HH2WG,"I was impressed by the performances of the core cast, especially Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Ritter, but the dialogue/storyline, while interesting, could've been better. I think the writer was trying be a little too subtle exploring the issues of class, appearance, honor and redemption/forgiveness.

While he's no Hitchcock, Fred Durst did a decent job as a first time director.

I'd recommend this one as a rental, but not one to purchase for repeat viewings.",1245801600,5,459,5.1891891891891895
3846821,5,B0024HH2WG,"Every generation goes through a loss of innocence and comes of age. Fred Durst remembers this time with simplicity, and draws us in. Through tenderness and rage we see a boy become a man.  The Education of Charlie Banks should not be missed.",1239148800,3,241,4.604651162790698
3846822,5,B0024HH2WG,"The Education of Charlie Banks was an excellent film. This independent film surfaces from a sea of mundane dramas. With elements of revenge between Charlie and his childhood bully which reminded me of the 1991 remake of Cape Fear and elements of admiration and chivalry the film is very dynamic. The timeline and set are also very interesting to me, the film starts in the mid seventies and jumps into the mid eighties, with all of the hair styles, clothing and props that bring you back to those time periods. With surprise twists and smart dialogue, it kept me interested and curious. A must see for drama fans.

The cast is great, the acting is top-notch.  There's very moving story, with stunning cinematography. I was touched from beginning to end.  Without revealing too much of the storyline, I will say that this was an thoroughly enjoyable and emotionally satisfying film.

3846824,2,B0024HH2WG,"In all honesty, I bought this movie only because I knew Jesse Eisenberg is in it. Ever since Adventureland, I've been a little obsessed with his subtle quirkiness and hilariously real awkwardness. He gives such a truth to films, like nothing I have seen before. The best way for me to describe it is as though one of my friends scored a starring role in a major motion picture. Tremendous acting job, but I still feel attached to him as an actual human being. Don't get me wrong, it does not take away from his performance by any means. If anything, it adds to it..and this is why you've gotta love him.

If I find him so amazing, why did I only give this movie 2 stars?... Good question.

I was confused by the way things played out (Don't worry- I will not give the ending away). I was just so distracted by something. Now, this may seem strange to some of you...but I really felt this strong sexual tension between Charlie and Mick. The whole film I kept focusing on it, and I was left with the feeling that this huge part of the story was neglected. It bothers me that no attention was paid to that.

And for that, an unforgiving let down - I give it 2 stars.",1282262400,,1163,4.253393665158371
3846825,5,B0024HH2WG,"Wow, talk about a VERY different spin on the typical school bully storyline.

The Education of Charlie Banks is about a skinny and wimpy teenage college student who becomes friends with a guy who constantly beats people up.  Throughout the film, the college student is terrified that he'll end up being the bullies next victim, but the bully actually wants to be friends with the guy instead.

One night the bully takes his anger issues a little too far and completely lays out a couple guys in a parking lot who were starting trouble.

Well it turns out that the person who told the cops about the bully being responsible for the fighting incident is... the skinny, wimpy kid!  Yes that's right- the bullies own friend ratted him out.

The storyline begins here- will the bully ever find out who ratted him out?  If he does, what will the bully do about it?  You'll have to watch the movie to find out.

I swear, the guy who plays the bully looks identical to WWE wrestler John Morrison, haha.  Just a coincidence (unless Morrison is keeping a huge secret about a movie role... doubtful).

What makes the Education of Charlie Banks such a good film is, of course, the bully himself.  The way he just completely flips out and snaps on people is incredible.  Talk about SERIOUS anger issues.

I found myself thoroughly enjoying this movie from beginning to end.  Through friendship and relationship troubles, to the potentially dangerous secrets, this movie offers really good drama.  A must see.",1278633600,2,1495,4.736434108527132

3846827,5,B0024HH2WG,"A real sleeper!  The Education of Charlie Banks marks an interesting directorial debut (I think) for rocker Fred Durst.  We'll have to see what future efforts bring, but this low budget feature packs an enormously satisfying wallop blessed by some intense, yet still understated work by a wonderful young cast headed by an enormously gifted Jason Ritter.

This is the type of ""kids"" film best left to adult viewing.  I know a number of younger kids for whom this pic would seem tailor made, and yet, the majority of them found it stiff and boring - while I found myself riveted, often to every frame.

I think this is a real sleeper/gem of a picture and it will be interesting seeing if this one ever catches on.  As for me, I think it will find true cult status over the ensuing years.  (And I'm always right!)",1261440000,3,811,4.513698630136986
3846828,3,B0024HH2WG,"""What's the point of this movie?"" Honestly, this was the one thought that kept going through my mind. I found it pointless, slow and a bit unfocused.

This is a ""coming of age"" movie that focuses on the relationship between Charlie Banks, a nerdy and sensitive kid, and Mick, a bully and friends with Danny, Charlie's roommate and childhood friend. Mick shows up one day at the university  Charlie and Danny attend ad stays for about a month. Charlie and Mick's relationship is shown to evolve to a sort of friendship albeit always strained.

The story is told from Charlie's point of view, and I could have cared less. I would have preferred Mick's point of view, it would have been more interesting.

This movie is a social study, a character story and a setting study. Mick, a self-proclaimed blue collar character, experiences the differences in social status. The setting is just as much part of the story as the rest of the characters, as it is instrumental in bringing about changes to Mick showing him the possibilities of what could be.

The cinematography was superb but the direction was all over the place. The acting sometimes fell flat, especially for Eva Amurri. Frankly, I was more interested in Gloria Votsis' character (Nia) and would have preferred if she were more central to the story.

Although this is an interesting story with a lot of potential, it could have been better with a little more editing. The featurette is the only extra worth talking about as it explains the basis behind the movie and the motivations of the characters. The rest of the extras are the audio commentary and trailers. Overall, it was ok, and recommend you watch if you like books such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Catcher-in-the-Rye/dp/0316769177/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Catcher in the Rye</a>.

Well, I set aside time to watch it and really didn't grab my attention. It's another ""coming of age"" film and I thought the direction was sloppy and acting just ""okay"".  There are lots of other reviews of the film here so I won't waste your time with a long review. It was a long movie and just didn't stand out in any way.

3846830,5,B0024HH2WG,"I purchased this movie along with GHOST RIDER, WATCHMEN and WITHOUT A PADDLE 2 at the local Wal Mart because 2 actors I like are in this. Jason Ritter and Christopher Marquette are those 2 actors. I saw these guys team up for FREDDY VS. JASON. They were great as their characters. THE EDUCATION OF CHARLIE BANKS is better than I expected but Ritter and Marquette totally steal the show. They were also in JOAN OF ARCADIA along with Amber Tamblyn (SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELLING PANTS) and Michael Welch (TWILIGHT). Great movie about friendship and the consequences of being too close to a friend. Jesse Eisenberg (ADVENTURELAND), Sebastian Stan (RACHEL GETTING MARRIED) and Eva Amurri (SAVED!) deliver great performances as well. Watch it if you get the chance and Jason Ritter is the son of the late actor; John Ritter (THREE'S COMPANY). I give this movie an infinity out of 5 star rating.",1253750400,3,888,4.810457516339869
3846831,5,B0024HH2WG,"A lot of people are going to watch this movie with a preconceived notion that it's bad because Fred Durst directed it. This isn't fair because Durst has matured a lot since his days of jumping up and down screaming about nookie with Limp Bizkit. In fact he actually does a really nice job with this film.

The movie is centered around the relationship between Charlie and Mick. Charlie is a socially awkward kid who witnesses Mick excessively beat up two punks. Charlie calls the police but later refuses to testify against Mick, setting him free. Mick disappears for a few years and Charlie goes to college. Charlie's roommate also knew Mick and one day Mick shows up in Charlie's dorm. Mick then befriends Charlie again and joins his circle of friends and becomes romantically involved with Charlie's love interest. Whether or not Mick knows about what Charlie had done to him years before is left up in the air.

Mick is shown to be a pretty decent guy as he pals around with Charlie's group and he seems to be turning his life around. That is, until the past starts to catch up with him. I'll stop here because this is when the plot starts to get really good.

This movie is an indie and it doesn't really have a big budget. However Jason Ritter and Jesse Eisenberg lead an excellent cast who really eliminate the need for any eye catching special effects. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw Fred Durst made a movie but I have to say this movie is definitely worth watching.",1253404800,3,1483,4.5055762081784385
3846832,2,B0024HH2WG,"I thought this movie was going to be a thriller. Nope. Boring as heck. A lot of talking, hardly any action. So Charlie Banks rats on that Mike kid, who only beat up 2 other boys. Those 2 other boys were trying to be macho and probably would have kicked Mike's butt anyway if he hadn't beat them first. Banks ends up retracting his statement to the cops. Big deal. Mike shows up at Banks' college. I thought things would pick up from there. It got even more boring. Rich kids drinking, smoking, partying, talking...zzzzzzzz.  Only good parts were the beat downs later on in the film.

3846836,2,B0024HH2WG,"I started watching this movie with friends, but we never finished as I found the tension from the Mick character disturbing and decided to watch something else on this evening.

Mick is a slimy bad school kid that reappears in Charlie's life years later in college. He is portrayed as a charmer with the girls, which I found insulting. I did however find the acting very good and I did like the Charlie character and will keep the movie around to perhaps watch on another day.",1249516800,2,476,4.534883720930233
3846837,4,B0024HH2WG,"Watching this film about childhood friends reminded me of my own youth and how sometimes we don't always get to pick who are friends are. 'The Education of Charlie Banks is a story that rings true to life.....or at least life as I know it!

I grew up not so much being a ""tough guy"", but certainly a guy most people didn't want to pick a fight with! I tell you this because even though I was a strong willed person, I have had to deal with people like ""Mick"" on and off for the past 40 years. I didn't see myself so much as one of these characters, but these were people I knew growing up.

This film deals with some very truthful relationships between real friends and people we are forced to associate with. The performances are really solid especially Jason Ritter who gives a scary performance without being scary. I have known people like this and I found his performance to be really dead on.

Watching Ritter you can't help but see his late father John and for some reason in this tough guy performance I saw some Matt Dillon too! He is part evil, he is part victim of circumstance and there are many layers to this troubled youth. The entire cast is very good with natural performances....not over the top in any way.

This is an excellent film and well worth seeing. The DVD has a great transfer and some interesting extras including commentary.",1248566400,3,1354,4.42570281124498
3846838,3,B0024HH2WG,"I liked THE EDUCATION OF CHARLIE BANKS enough to watch it from start to finish. The acting and ambitious story line (the director plays with serious themes) were both solid attempts. Yet the whole enterprise left me rather cold. I think one of the most bothersome things about the film was the choice to set it in the 1970s...not that there's anything wrong with that. But when a film (or a book or a play) is set in a specific time period, I think there should be a reason for it. Otherwise, it's distracting and you ending up watching it and wondering, ""Okay, what is the artist trying to say about that period? How did the period play into the artistic thesis?"" With this film, the question was unanswerable; it could have been set just as easily in current times. This kind of detail is something that should have been thought through before the cameras rolled and is indicative of a desire to impress without thinking first of what one is communicating.",1248220800,3,958,4.575581395348837
3846839,2,B0024HH2WG,"If the acting in ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" had been better, it might have been a decent movie. Not great, but decent. As things stand, however, the combination of a dull, predictable plot and substandard acting make Charlie Banks a big ol' waste of time.

The plot, such as it is, centers around Charlie Banks, played by Jesse Elsenberg who here plays the only kind of role that he ever plays, a nervous, nerdy nice kid perpetually afraid of getting swatted down like an insect. Charlie is enjoying the college life, having philosophical discussions with his friends while drinking beers, chasing women (unsuccessfully), when he and his roommate receive a visit from Mick (Jason Ritter), a charming sociopath that they know from earlier in the film.

The meat of the film is supposed to revolve around Charlie's quasi-friendship with Mick, who is equal parts bully, mentor, and friend to Charlie. I won't ruin the ending but I will tell you that nothing happens that you don't expect. The writer attempts to prepare the audience for this lack of surprise by having the characters discuss The Great Gatsby and how, even the first time you read it, you already know how it's going to end, but that doesn't make it any less brilliant. In fact, they tell us, it makes it even better. It makes the ending seem all the more tragic because it's so inevitable.

Well, Charlie Banks isn't The Great Gatsby and the formulaic ending (Charlie faces his fears, etc.) nicely caps off a film that is rich with stereotypes and cliches.

The biggest problem with Charlie Banks, however, is the performance of Jason Ritter as the bully-friend-mentor, Mick. We are told repeatedly throughout the movie how charismatic Mick is, even though (or, perhaps, precisely because) he's such a violent guy. Jason Ritter doesn't come across as either dangerous or charismatic. Most of the time, he just looks goofy. He does hit people a few times, it's true, but that action does not spring naturally from his character; he simply does it because it's written in the script.

The other lame performance in this movie is the love interest, Eva Amurri. Both Charlie and Mick are completely in love with this woman; I have no idea why. She's not particularly beautiful, she certainly never says or does anything even remotely interesting, and by the end of the film we still have no idea who she is or why she made the choices that she did.

""The Education of Charlie Banks"" is a movie that will pound you over the head with its foreshadowing, symbolism, and attempts at ""deepness"" but ultimately it's just a big ol' bore.",1248048000,3,2596,4.783482142857143
3846840,3,B0024HH2WG,"Initially the only thing that drew me to 'The Education of Charlie Banks' was the presence of Jesse Eisenberg in the title role. I like to think of him as a next generation John Cusack, a nice looking but rather nerdish, awkward male who habitually over analyses and over talks every situation. Especially when there's a girl involved. After viewing the film I'm pleased to say that there's more here than just the usual strong, enjoyable Mr. Eisenberg.

'The Education of Charlie Banks' is an entertaining, thoughtful and surprisingly intelligent journey into the minds, hearts and longtime strained relationship between two very different young men, Charlie and hardcore bully Mick (Jason Ritter). Mick has both frightened and fascinated Charlie since early childhood when Charlie witnessed a brutal beating handed out by the bully to another neighborhood boy. Unfortunately for Charlie his best friend and college room mate was also a friend of Mick's. When Mick shows up in their dorm room out of the blue all of Charlie's fears and anxieties from the past return, embodied in their surprise guest.

Can people change for the better or is Mick still the angry, brutal, dangerous person he's always been. More importantly, will Charlie be able to face his fears and prepare himself for whatever lays ahead?

This ""coming of age"" film will definitely surprise its viewers. The story line takes some nice twists and turns, the performances are impressive and Jason Ritter delivers a performance his Father would have been proud of. The chemistry between Eisenberg and Ritter worked beautifully.

3846841,3,B0024HH2WG,"Fred Durst's directorial debut is a tremendous disappointment, a film with a fatal - but deliberate - flaw that destroys its overall effect.  And that's sad because there are many fine things about ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" to admire ... including an outstanding performance by Jesse Eisenberg in the title role; solid supporting work by cast members Jason Ritter and Eva Amurri; fluid cinematography by Alex Nepomniaschy; and distinguished art direction, set decorations, and costumes that create a captivating sense of time and place (an Ivy League college in the mid-1970's).

Unfortunately, all these considerable plusses are compromised by a morally ambiguous script by Peter Elkoff.  Elkoff introduces us to a bully named Mick (Ritter) whose violent and uncontrollable temper leads him to beat two of Charlie's high school classmates nearly to death.  Charlie, an eyewitness to the assault, at first agrees to help the police, and then backs down.  A couple of years pass and Mick shows up at Charlie's college and insinuates himself into Charlie's crowd of friends, seducing the young woman with whom Charlie is smitten (Amurri).  The stage is now set for a suspenseful clash between Charlie and Mick - and a crisis between Charlie and his own conscience - but instead, Elkoff reveals that Mick has finally gone too far and murdered someone; he then tries to build up audience sympathy for Mick!  At that point, the whole story collapses because Elkoff has already made Mick too much a villain, and he never gives the audience a reason to suddenly embrace this disturbed and unredeemed killer.

Puzzled by this change of tone and theme, I sought answers in one of the DVD's extra features, ""Conversations Behind `The Education of Charlie Banks'"".  That's where I learned, through interviews, that screenwriter Elkoff and director Durst had deliberately diffused the natural arc of the story by shifting the emphasis off of Charlie and on to Mick.  Their intent was to be clever, and to give the audience something unexpected.  They succeeded - but not, unfortunately, in a believable way.  Thus, this offbeat film may be worth a rental, but is not recommended for purchase.",1247529600,3,2187,5.095238095238095
3846842,2,B0024HH2WG,"It's unclear what this movie lacks, but one has a constant feeling that there is something missing. The storyline of a boy growing up and getting over his fear of the local bully seems almost too elaborate for this film. The actors are decent (Jason Ritter and Jesse Eisenberg) to mediocre (the female leads - Eva Amurri and Gloria Votsis), with no standout performances.

It's impossible to say how much Fred Durst (yes, the lead singer of Limp Bizkit) is at fault for the final execution of the film and how much is the screenwriter's fault. Generally, it seems that the storyline, while being cohesive, manges to feel disjointed and some items alluded to throughout the movie wind up not being crucial at its end (perhaps that's the editor's mistake, less than the director's).",1247529600,2,780,4.82089552238806
3846843,2,B0024HH2WG,"This film is cringeworthy for anyone who's been on the receiving end of a bully.  Despite how very elementary those buttons are, this film succeeds in pushing them through Charlie's primary and secondary education, into young adulthood.  The storyline leans toward redemption at times, though never really spills into it.  In that light the pace flags a bit and feels like pertinent bits of the story have been left out.  The acting was well done, it just felt like the story itself couldn't decide where it was going.  By the time it meandered to the end I found I didn't really care how things turned out.  Its messages on bullying, self-esteem and karma are clear, it just doesn't do a very good job of showing them.",1247443200,2,719,4.666666666666667
3846844,4,B0024HH2WG,"This rehashed coming of age story directed by Fred Durst really had my expectations low.  Going in with an open mind however I found an authentic and surprisingly grounded drama with some great performances.  We have all had personalities in our lives, the ones that are bigger than life and seem to survive only out of sheer will.  Here Jason Ritter does an exceptional job portraying one of those types who seem to pass through our lives at impressionable ages.  The antagonist/protagonist roles are blurred a little here as the leads are allowed to show different sides of their personalities.  While the storyline itself doesn't exactly break ground there is an overall feeling of reality that really aids this film.  The music is bit much and is way too loud in the mix, but the film editing and fine performances make up for this oversight.  Really a surprise to find a retro NY growing up story that doesn't exploit the era and its music relentlessly as well.  If you like this film check out Jonathan Lethem's novel FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE as some of the material here feels ""inspired"" by that book.  Recommended for its lack of showy direction, solid performances.",1247443200,,1170,4.81
3846845,3,B0024HH2WG,"I must confess that when I saw that ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" was directed by Fred Durst, my skin began to crawl and I felt the urge to dry heave.  If you couldn't already figure it out, I am not a big fan of Mr. Durst or the band he fronts, ""Limp Bizkit"".  Nevertheless, I have watched many different types of films in my days so I figure I'd give this movie a go.

The plot of this movie is very extensional in nature.  Charlie Banks is played by Jesse Eisenberg (who looks like he could be related to Charles Fleischer, the voice of Roger Rabbit).  The movie basically starts off with Charlie as a high school student in the late 1970s.  One night Charlie is at a party with his friends and witnesses a fight between two jocks and Mick (Jason Ritter).

Mick is your typical loner and/or bad boy.  He came from a rough family background and doesn't take any crap, when there is conflict it is resolved with his fists.  Well during this fight Mick almost kills these two jocks.  Charlie feels conflicted about the matter and then reports it to the police.  However, Charlie doesn't want to seem like a snitch so he decides that he doesn't want to go forward with his confession.  Since Charlie was the only witness who stepped forward, all charges against Mick are dropped.

Now fast forward about three to four years.  We are in the early 1980s and Charlie is going to college.  It appears that Charlie has matured a bit, he appears a bit more seasoned with regards to intelligence, despite the fact he is still rather meek.  He is living in a dorm with Danny (Chris Marquette) who Charlie went to high school with and has a major crush on a girl named Mary (Eva Amurri).

Life seems to be going really well until one day Mick shows back up.  Charlie immediately regresses to his high school years.  Well to make a long story short, Mick starts hanging out with Charlie and his friends, even starts ""seeing"" Mary.  Charlie grapples to let bygones be bygones, knowing the person Mick was and embrace the idea that Mick has changed since Charlie last saw him.

It soon is discovered that Mick hasn't changed his ways too much and has still endorsed havoc since the days of high school.  Charlie is then presented with the notion ""If I had gone through with my confession, none of this would have happened"" with regards to Mick's current path of disorder.

This movie was much better than I expected, it really raises some philosophical and moral issues about cause and effect.  The elemental concept that one event influences another and in life there are no answers only choices. This resulted in a very unique story. The acting was very solid, Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Ritter shined as the two leads.  As for Jason Ritter, in some angles he looks just like his father (the late John Ritter).

In contrast, I felt the movie was very slow and clunky in parts.  I suppose the pace was to aid character development, I feel it made the film lag.  Another dubious factor in this film was Mick living indefinitely on a college campus without being a student.  I didn't attend college in the early 1980s, so who knows.  However, I remember when I went to college, people couldn't just ""hang around"" or just sit randomly in a classroom and make remarks without being enrolled.  Not to mention that Mick wasn't working, so where was he getting money to eat, smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol?  These former factors keep this film from being a four star movie, but it is definitely a solid three stars.

With regards to Fred Durst, I have to tip my hat to him.  For his directorial debut he really did a solid job.  I am not sure if film making is his true calling or not, but this movie definitely overshadows any of the music that he has produced, in my humble opinion.  So if you are in the mood for a coming of age story that is extensional/ philosophical in nature, then get ""educated"" with Charlie Banks.",1247097600,4,3910,4.4886685552407934
3846846,3,B0024HH2WG,"Fred Durst directs this story of Charlie Banks, an average kid, growing up in an average life.  At a party, through a friend of a friend, he is introduced to the violence that can be out there in the ""real world."" Mick is a young tough, with a reputation established even as a young boy.  This reputation is affirmed as Charlie witnesses Mick give a horrible beating to two young men.

Our story fast forwards to the college years for Charlie.  He is doing well at a nice Ivy League school.  He has a good circle of friends, and has a crush on one of them, Mary.  Quite suddenly one day, Mick shows up.  Mick is embraced by Charlie's friends, as they all live a life of priviledge, someone like Mick is a curiosity to them.  Predictably, Mary falls for his ""bad boy"" image.  Despite her clear iterest in Charlie, Mary hooks up with Mick, much to Charlie's consternation.

Again, predictably, Mick doesn't really belong in this world, and this truth eventually comes out.

The questions presented are good ones, trust, honesty and loyalty.  However, I found the story a bit long (maybe 10 more minutes could have been cut), and I found the whole thing to be quite predictable.  It was good, the acting was solid, Charlie's character is compelling, but the overall story simply didn't hold me.

Yet, I doubt that this, for want of a better categorization, ""coming of age"" film by Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, was a major financial hit. Too bad, too. It features fine performances by a pretty interesting cast, including Jesse Eisenberg & Jason Ritter, and a really solid script by Peter Elkoff, that takes the cliches we have come to expect and, if it doesn't exactly turn them on their head, does something even better. It treats the potentially cliche characters as if they were actual HUMAN BEINGS, and when was the last time you saw a movie do that in this day and age. Look, if your idea of a meaningful movie involves talking cars from outer space, you're NOT going to like this. But if you are one of those (sadly, rapidly lessenig)people who think a movie with real people, giving real performances, in a real story, just MAY be worthwhile, I urge you to try this one.",1246579200,,995,4.564245810055866
3846849,2,B0024HH2WG,"THE EDUCATION OF CHARLIE BANKS is a mistitled film considering the protagonist Charlie learns next to nothing in the film's entire 100 minute run time. He starts out a kid who is dominated by fascination and fear of the antagonist, and ends up an older kid dominated by fear and fascination of the antagonist. The plot is stale, lifeless, and doesn't carry the story forward with any momentum at all.

Charlie is a kid from Greenwich Village who grew up equally curious and afraid of bully Mic (who starts beating people senseless at the age of 8 and never looks back). His life is forever changed when he witnesses Mic commit a violent crime and then backs out of testifying against him (out of fear of reprisal), and who later heads off to an elite university, no-one the wiser that it was he who 'ratted' out Mic to the police. The second act begins with Charlie at school with a bunch of rich kids (Charlie himself is not rich).

Charlie's inability to make decisions, act on his own behalf, or contend for the woman he's fallen in love with even as she is stolen away, make him a fairly irritating protagonist that it is very hard to like. His spinelessness is nearly constant throughout the film, and even at the very end when he is forced to act, he does so without any real emotion or energy. This movie watches like a boring version of FIGHT CLUB set at an upscale east coast university where the 'idle rich' do pretty much nothing except drink and get down like a rabbit colony (although that's kept mostly off camera). Charlie is such a painfully awkward biped (think Napoleon Dynamite's brother Kip with a bit of a hunch-back) that watching him shuffle around (much less play basketball!) is brutal. I'm not sure if actor Jesse Eisenberg walks like this in real life or if it was part of the character; regardless it's yet another reason he is very hard to root for.

One of the worst things about the movie is how overblown the props are. Director Durst seems hell-bent on making sure you really, really KNOW that it is the 70s, and then later the 80s. RAGING BULL posters, Atari game systems, bell bottoms, and even the music are layered on with an intensity that treats the viewer like they've got a sub 80 IQ and need a movie strewn with visual ques to realize when the movie is set. What makes this infuriating is that the setting has NOTHING to do with the story; it could have been set in 1940 or 2009 and would not have changed a thing.

There are a few bright spots, including a nice performance by Jason Ritter as Mic. He's got energy and charisma, and given a better character, directing, and dialogue, could potentially become an A-list talent. He's a bit of a one trick pony in the film, but he does that trick quite well. However, his character isn't given enough edge to really be scary, he's more of a charming bad-boy with a serious anger control problem--he says too much, and is treated too sympathetically by the director.

The writing is occasionally interesting and highbrow, including references to Hegel, Deconstructionist Theory, and 'the banality of evil.' There are some subtexts that are not really explored, and might have made the movie that much better if they had been given some space. The implications of the discussion of deconstructionism is that the films serves that role in its exploration of the Mic character. Sadly, there is no real examination, only a facade that reveals nothing complex or rewarding.

An example of this lack of depth & follow through is in the film's 'Checkov' problem. Anton Chekhov is widely recognized as the originator of the paradigm that you can't introduce a conspicuous person, object, or other plot element into a story and then never deliver a follow through (his example was a gun above the mantle piece that is described or shown, but then never fired--Alfred Hitchcock explored this concept ad nauseam in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trouble-with-Harry/dp/B000ECX0S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trouble with Harry</a>). There is a pretty good indication given in the film that Mic might be gay (he is shown surreptitiously smelling a piece of Danny's clothing (Charlie's room-mate and longtime friend of Mic) early in the film. Charlie sees him doing this, and makes a noise to alert Mic of his presence, and Mic turns away and pretends to be doing something else. Couple this with the fact that Mic came to stay at the college in the first place, as well as a conversation between Danny and Mic (both drunk after a school dance) in which Danny offers to dance with Mic, who looks a little too interested, and I'd say this is a major undeveloped plot line that should have been explored. It would certainly have added much more intrigue and depth to the storyline.

An average film at best, THE EDUCATION OF CHARLIE BANKS never really drives any point home. Charlie doesn't seem to learn much of anything. The things he has learned don't count for much, and the viewer is left to puzzle over what the movie wanted to say. Apparently, not a whole lot.

Fascinated by Charlie's privileged lifestyle, Mick quickly wins over Charlie's friends and girlfriend, Mary (Eva Amurri), as he insinuates himself into Charlie's life.  There is an underlying tension throughout the film, based on what we know about Mick, what we suspect, and the forces operating to come into inevitable conflict.  Eisenberg (""Adventureland"") turns in a natural performance complete with downcast eyes, jerky gestures, and awkward gait.  The film is a variation on the coming-of-age movie for which Hollywood has a passion, since it layers on themes of personal responsibility,  loyalty and peer pressure, and doesn't just settle on a first-love melodrama.  Ritter's Mick is especially good as a guy whose charm allows him to fit in and be accepted where he doesn't truly belong.

3846851,4,B0024HH2WG,"Have you ever wondered what happened to your school's class bully?  Watch ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" and you'll learn what may have happened to him.  Meet streetwise, street tough Mick Leary (Jason Ritter of ""Swimfan"" ""Freddy vs. Jason"" and ""The Wicker Man""); he is from the proverbial wrong side of the tracks.  Mick has a following of friends who think he's real cool.  As a child, he mercilessly beat up the other boys on the playground.  Eventually he grows up to assault football jocks at preppy high school parties.

  An adorable nerd, Charlie Banks (Jesse Eisenberg of Wes Craven`s ""Cursed"") is from a caring middle class family; he witnesses Mick nearly kill the two jocks.  Charlie is willing to testify against him in court; however, he learns that his wealthy friend Danny idolizes Mick and he recounts his testimony.  Years later, Danny and Charlie are rooming at an Ivy League university and Mick appears, needing a place to stay.  He tries to assimilate with Danny's wealthy friends, managing to impress them and steal Charlie`s girlfriend Mary during the process.

  ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" is a complex, psychological drama that unnerved me.  Even when Mick and his newfound friends are having fun and enjoying life, I felt tense and nervous.  I kept waiting for Mick to explode, revealing his true inner self.  Eventually, his anger is unleashed and all of Danny's friends become targets of Mick's uncontrollable violence.  The film abruptly turns from ""coming of age"" drama to psychological thriller that borders on horror.  The ending is rather shocking when dark secrets are finally revealed.

  The acting from all the leads is wonderful, the photography is beautiful, and Fred Durst's directorial debut is an excellent one.  The viewer can't help but feel an emotional attachment to the various characters which Durst brings vividly to life in this unique film.  Not only does Charlie receive an education, but the viewer will also - an education in honesty, forgiveness and acceptance.  Most of all, the viewer will learn that one must control his/her anger if one is to keep their friends.

English subtitles have been provided.  There are audio commentary and a ""making of"" featurette titled ""Conversations Behind The Education of Charlie Banks"" which consists of interesting interviews from the cast and crew.

3846852,5,B0024HH2WG,"The Education of Charlie Banks is a highly intelligent drama that examines poignant issues surfaced by the struggle between the haves and have not and how important is to be part of a family, interacting with others and socializing to develop the right set of life skills.

The main characters are played by: Jesse Eisenberg, Jason Ritter, Eva Amurri, Christopher Marquette, Sebastian Stan, and Gloria Votsis. For the most part, we were not familiar with the actors but they render magnificent performances.

Jason Ritter's performance is superb and we felt as though we knew him, so we looked him up and were delighted to realize that he is the son of one of our favorite actors, the late John Ritter who used to play the role of Jack Tripper in ABC's show: Three's Company. So... we were looking at the father... through the son!

This movie is about an introverted child who as he grows, learns to walk through the door of his fears, all in his desire to do the right thing.

Charley and his best friend Danny witness a near murder of some students during a brawl at a party and Charlie goes to the police to tell them what happens, but his friend tells him that to ""rat"" on others is unacceptable behavior, that the person who contacted the police will soon be identified and that he would never rat on him... no matter what.

So, Charlie goes back to the police and withdraws his testimony against Mick, the only thing the police had to get him convicted of nearly killing the two students. Charlie's father owns a book store and tells Charlie that he is sorry to see him choose to let the guilty person go without punishment, that ""Charlie has great ideals, but if he lets wrong go unpunished, then all is useless"" because no one should be able to get away with such violence.

As the years go by, we now see Charlie, brilliantly performed by Eisenberg and Danny, performed by Christopher Marquette, matriculated in an Ivy League college, where super rich students attend classes and are able to afford fancy cars, acquire boats and live life with great ease.

Leo, played by Sebastian Stan, is the epitome of a spoiled young man, who gives away his possessions as if giving out candy and yet is unable to sympathize with the struggle of a young woman who would lose her job if he would not return a key he takes to enter a party through the back door to not have to pay the $20 entrance fee.

Nia, is a Greek heiress played by Gloria Votsis, and Mary, played by Amurri, is a beautiful young woman that Charlie falls in love with.

Charlie is horrified when Mick appears at their college dorm asking to stay for a while. Mick tells Danny he is visiting for just a few days but Charlie suspects that he is there hiding from another episode of violent behavior. One night, while walking back to their room, his fears are aroused as he sees Mick hiding away from a police patrolling car that passes them on the street.

Charlie's love for Mary continues to grow, but as soon as she meets Mick, she gets attracted to his dominant male charisma and soon, these two are involved in a torrid affair.

At some point, while photographing Charlie, Mary confesses to him that her aristocratic senator father always tells her that he does not approve of the men she chooses to date,

As time goes by, Charlie comes to realize that his father was right and that his choice has brought dire consequences to those in his closest circle of friendship.

The dialogue is intense, intelligent, and the characters are developed with a sense of slow precision that keeps us riveted on the performers.

We came to love Charlie, to despise and yet want to protect Mick, to feel contempt for Leo and yet wish we had his fortune. The school grounds are magnificent. The movie is filmed in Providence, Rhode Island on what appears to be the grounds of Brown University.

Without a doubt, this is a magnificent film, a highly intelligent drama that surfaces poignant issues of class difference, growing without limitations on behavior and the consequences of letting evil get away with murder. Don't miss it!",1245974400,3,4087,4.6024759284731775
3846853,4,B0024HH2WG,"When I first heard ""directed by Fred Durst"" in reference to this film, the slightest positive expectation I had for the movie went way down. I'm not a fan of Durst's music nor his celebrity persona, so I didn't have any sort of high expectations at all. I can't say I'd describe the film, now that I've seen it, as a ""tense and compelling drama"" but I'm still surprised by what I just saw.

The movie begins in New York City in the early `70s where two young boys stand in awe of another young boy, who's the toughest kid in town. The first two boys are Charlie Banks and Danny; the tough kid is Mick Leary.

Now, a few years later, Charlie (Jessie Eisenberg) and Danny (Christopher Marquette) run into Mick (Jason Ritter) at a party. Soon, Mick brutally assaults a couple of partygoers and Charlie reports it to the police.

Now, Charlie and Danny are in college living the highlife, when Mick suddenly arrives.

Charlie and Mick are very different characters. Charlie is timid and insecure, while Mick is suave and aggressive. Watching the two characters interact is interesting on it's own terms, but the performances are what really bring them to life.

Ritter (the son of the late John Ritter) completely embodies Mick. He perfectly captures the charismatic, tough-guy element in his performance. I've seen Ritter in a few other independent films and this is a very different character than I've seen him play before, but he nails it. I think there is definitely movie-star potential in Ritter.

Eisenberg is also very good as Charlie. Physically, he fits the role pretty well already. He looks like a shy, timid young man. The difference between Ritter and Eisenberg is that I can't see the latter playing characters very different from this one in future roles.

The script (by Peter Elkoff) is well written. Good characterization, simple and subtle dialogue, etc. His use of voice-over narration by Charlie is scattered, as if he didn't know how to fill the scene with anything else, but other than that...He's written something unique.

The Education of Charlie Banks is not a great film, but it doesn't over-stay it's welcome. It has great characters and a likeable cast and is surprisingly well-made too. Durst seems to be a natural behind the camera and, with that, this is a pretty impressive directorial debut. Anyone who's not a fan of Durst will certainly be surprised by this film, whether they like the film or not. Worth watching...

The film begins off with the secret and I don't spoil it anymore for anybody who plans to still see it.

Three years later, Charlie sees Mick again in his Ivy league college room. He's shocked and stunned. With their friend, Danny, they all hang out together. Mick leaches off of Charlie's life including friends and his crush, Mary. Mick is really in awe of Charlie's college life.

But it all catches up to him in the film, the film is slow at times. Eisenberg and Ritter keep the film flowing though. They do a good job with their characters. Anyway the film has a behind the scenes look at the making of this film.

This film lacks a strong script to begin with and the actors do a terrific job in bringing them to life. Dennis Boutikaris has a small role as Charlie's father which I would have liked to have seen more of in this film. Anyway, the film ends without a bang.

8350652,3,B0024HH2WG,"I saw this movie pretty much because of ""The Social Network"". I thought it would be interesting to see Eisenberg in a pre-Social Network college film. I watched the audio commentary of Social Network and Fincher said he had seen Charlie Banks prior to making Social Network.

I don't know much about Durst but found it funny that he was the director of this. He definitely has ambition and you can tell he put a lot of work into this. The acting is pretty good. I was happy to see John Ritter's son turning in good work. The movie starts out about Charlie but becomes more about the Ritter character. Kind of uneven, and there's not enough story. What's there is fine, but it just seems undeveloped, kind of like its young characters.

So it's an affectionate thumbs down. With a better script, Durst might really surprise us one day.

P.S. (spoiler) There is the threat of violence in a scene that made me cringe. It was really well done. Scorsese would nod his head in approval.

8350654,4,B0024HH2WG,"I have to say that there is a certain balancing of lightheartedness and impending doom that permeates throughout this movie.  The lighthearted side attempts to tell the story of a boy named Charlie and his college experience, the growth of a boy to a man.  With this growth comes all of the pains and suffering of experience.  And sure, some people like that real to life uneasiness that comes from awkward situations, but others do not.  If are one of the ""Nots"" - then this is not going to be your cup of tea... almost guaranteed.

Charlie Banks (Jesse Eisenberg) is a likable character but the cast of associates he hangs around with ultimately causes him the situational problems that occur in this movie.  One of the standout performances of this movie is the one given by Jason Ritter.  I had seen him in Joan of Arcadia and thought he was very good actor and very reminiscent of his late father John Ritter.  But, in this movie Jason Ritter is playing outside of his typical casting and he is amazing.

If I was to get into the philosophy of the college experience or life through chance, then you might understand the plot of this movie.  But, the plot is almost secondary to what is really just a simple story done well.  Though there are characters that tie Charlie to the character of Mick (Ritter) including a well acted love interest (Eva Amurri) and a great part played by Chris Marquette as the best friend.  Those characters only serve to keep the Ritter performance close by.  Ritter's character is almost just a catalyst for the Eisenberg character and vice versa.  Banks as the defensive but goodhearted non-socialite and Ritter as the blue-collared yet likable rough-edged outsider, these are the two sides of the spectrum that play well off of each other - and ultimately make this movie worth watching.

You will never be able to guess how their opposite charged personalities will react from one encounter to the next.  To me, this is the reason to watch this movie... the unsteady tension of these moments.  But in the end, it is like watching a train while standing on the tracks.  Not exactly like watching a train wreck, but you get allure.  You can see it coming from a mile away and you don't want to be standing on the tracks when it arrives.",1283990400,,2272,4.606965174129353
