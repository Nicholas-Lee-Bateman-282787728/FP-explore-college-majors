8509437,4,B0073UJP6A,"This piano book is good for moderate players who want to improve their site reading.

I use scanning of my piano books to have a copy I can write on and not destroy the original copy. This newer edition has a larger sheet compared to older editions of the Suzuki method. Thus it is not ideal for scanning and carrying between rooms if you are carrying several other books. This could cause the ends of the pages to bend. These sheets are approximately 8.5x12, not the traditional 8.5x11.

However this newer edition offers more suggestions for the ornaments of the pieces such as the trills and grace notes. The CD is the main reason why I chose for this newer copy, as I had no means of using a tape player for the older editions.",1359676800,3,731,4.407407407407407
