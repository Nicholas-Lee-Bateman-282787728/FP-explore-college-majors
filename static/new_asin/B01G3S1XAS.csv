8762282,4,B01G3S1XAS,A really enjoyable Scifi Film not Final Fantasy in anyway.....if you enjoyed Starship troopers or any of the Appleseed movies then you will love it....if your watching Because you love Final Fantasy then you will probably throw up.,1476835200,7,231,5.105263157894737

8762284,1,B01G3S1XAS,"I can't say that this was a good movie.  While the concept of a Final Fantasy movie was good, this movie failed to show what made the franchise great.  I was confused when watching this film and should not have been.  There was nothing that suggested the main protagonist was the only one who could resolve the plot and the sacrifice was pointless.  In short, this film did not move me.",1475625600,8,386,4.394366197183099
