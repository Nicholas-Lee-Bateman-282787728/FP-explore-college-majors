8280790,4,B0009WIEMA,"Gene Autry and Roy Rogers ride the range in this impressive set of 27 feature films.  If you're just starting your collection, you can't go wrong with this collection of films from the silver screen's most-prolific singing cowboys.  For those Westerns fans that have a fairly extensive collection, though, there are few films that haven't been distributed widely in other budget compilations.  In fact, this set is merely a repackaging of other Platinum Disc offerings under their TV Classic Westerns and The Great American Western collections.  Another caveat is that many of the films have been edited from their original length to fit in an hour TV time slot.  Although there's been no attempt to remaster the films, all are copied from prints that range from decent to very good quality.  Films included in this set are:
