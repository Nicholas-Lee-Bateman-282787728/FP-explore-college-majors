It's just blatantly dishonest of this company to re-sell these titles with no notation whatsoever on the cover that will tell the unsuspecting buyer that these have already been released once, and are still currently available.

In fact, you'll have no idea that they are the same two DVDs until the plastic is off the package and you see the discs themselves, and VOILA!...too late for a return, and you're out $$$$$$ yet again.",1286928000,3,642,4.732142857142857
