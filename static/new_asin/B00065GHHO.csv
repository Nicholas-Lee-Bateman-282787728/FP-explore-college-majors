8038968,5,B00065GHHO,"Trumpet is not an electric guitar for young angry boys to steam out. Trumpet is an orchestral instrument and you bet you will have to learn every part and inch of it before you play the darn thing.

For those who think exercises are short and blah blah, they better grab a something else.

This DVD will lead you from the basics and its up to you to get the instrument in your hand and start practice. Every 15 sec exercise translates to hours or practice.

If you serious about trumpet, but this DVD, it's a great start.",1257897600,2,521,4.295918367346939
8038969,1,B00065GHHO,"Don't buy this expensive DVD. Get real: do you think anyone could be that genius and teach you everything about trumpet playing in one single DVD? This DVD even wastes time demonstrating what the structure of a trumpet is. It's menu looks quite inclusive, but think about what you can learn about breathing, for example, in fewer than 10 minutes' instruction (it's probably 3 minutes or even shorter, but I don't remember, because I sold it already.)

Go find a real teacher. Practice, practice, and practice!",1207440000,3,509,4.9186046511627906
8038970,5,B00065GHHO,"I am new to Trumpet playing.  This DVD explains everything one needs to know about the Trumpet.  It is like you are sitting in a Trumpet class at one of the best Trumpet schools !  It's divided into different parts and you can go back and forth anytime, like opening a good trumpet reference book.  Even my teacher likes it. If it can only be finetuned, visiting trumpet factory other than Yamaha will help to strengthen this DVD.  I own Bach, Yamaha, and King, and want to know their manufacturing process as well. With all the contents, I would recommend any trumpeters to buy, especially those beginners and intermediaters.",1180656000,7,626,4.706422018348624
8038971,5,B00065GHHO,"I was given this DVD for xmas by a friend. I am very impressed with the sincerity, depth,  and understanding that Mr. Vache, his colleagues and students show. This DVD is an excellent resource for trupet students who are passionate about their music. The trumpet method described by Mr. Vache is straightforward and based on lots of experience. The fingering exercises are excellent. I have been playing trumpet for 1.5yrs",1109289600,12,422,5.0285714285714285
