5382220,5,B00A6B70DS,"A friend of mine talked about how she went to a Hot Hula Class in Las Vegas and how fantastic a workout it was.  I was intrigued and decided to check it out on YouTube.  It looked like lots of fun.  I love to dance, but am a big girl and worry about not being able to handle some of those other video's like hip hop abs or the zumba ones.  I decided to buy them and love, love, love Rita.  She is amazing, has awesome energy and is really supportive throughout the whole video.  I like how she shares her story about gaining a lot of weight when coming to the states and how through working out she really became the happy person she is again.  No lie, I did this video every other day for two weeks and my jeans started to get loose, you can't imagine how excited I was, I'm even started to have a real waist.  If you do this consistently I am convinced you will have a tone bum, thighs and a middle that you can show off to the world.",1323561600,45,936,3.9679144385026737
5382221,4,B00A6B70DS,"I recently purchased this DVD set and am glad that I did.  There are three 60 minute workouts, beginning, intermediate, and advanced.  Each dvd includes a break-down of steps, warmup, choreography, dance, legs, and cool down.  I have done the first two dvds and they are both good workouts with hula-oriented choreography and dance moves.  The instructor is native to New Zealand and is in great shape.  Her 17 year old daughter is part of her dance group, along with several other girls.  The music is a mixture of reggae, rap, and percussion.  If you like to collect dance and workout dvds, you would probably enjoy having this in your collection.  If you are looking for traditional hula, this is not it.  This series is more like the Island Girl dvds, with an instructor that is wilder and plays wilder music on her set.  Also the dvds are filmed in a studio and not out on a beach.  Overall I am happy with my purchase and will include these in my rotation of dvds.",1321315200,31,970,4.517241379310345

5382226,1,B00A6B70DS,"I first heard about Hot Hula on a FB ad for getting certified as an instructor. I jumped for it. I grew up in Hawaii and love Hula! It was fun to take the class lead by Anna- Rita herself and get assimilated to the moves. But by the end of the seven hour class I realized that there are only a small number of moves and a couple of them are not my style at all, the skanky leg for one... not hula! There also isn't room for personal creativity, you learn the dances and teach as is! It truely lacks the feel of expressing the body, jerky moves repeated with an occasional ""Sooooeeee"" from Anna-Rita. Hot hula is a sad attempt to create a modern Hula equivalent to the accessibility and umph of Zumba. I like Zumba and when I go I am invigorated by the constant challenges of new moves and the teacher's personal style. To me I think learning hip hop is as complex as learning Hula choreography, so why the need for a cheap hula? I'll tell you, Hula is already patented and Anna Rita decided to make up her own! She is a savvy business women, poor choreographer. In case you are wondering. I did also buy the DVD at that class, but I ended up passing it onto a thrift store (should have destroyed it) it's even worse than in person! I hope to see the end of Hot Hula soon. Those who love it absolutely love it, but I call blasphemy! It's not just that it's ""impure"", I am fine with hula variations, Hip Hop Buns and Abs is great, Hot Hula is just bad!",1443225600,3,1450,4.127208480565371

5382230,5,B00A6B70DS,"Just received it today and the first workout is awesome and Anita-rita is helpful and mischievous! I do a lot of different workout videos like Jillian and kettle bell dvds, and I was worried that this may be a little too low impact. But I was sweating like a pig within the first 20 minutes and my thighs are very sore(in the best way) right now, along with my core.

5382232,5,B00A6B70DS,"I've done the first dvd a few times and I love it. It's fun and she's adorable. She's not fake, I believe she is showing her true personality. If you don't know have to shake your hips or even dance you will learn from this. It's fun and I plan on doing it m-sat and can't wait to see how my body changes. I'm 34, 5'7 about 160. I put on a lot from 130 since I started working from home at a desk 2.5 yrs ago. I'm wanting to loose weight and build muscle.

Edit: I still like these videos but I get a little frustrated trying to learn the moves which takes away from my workout. I love her leg excersises and will continue to use certain sections of her videos but I am also using leslie Sansone videos and her workouts are even better, easier to follow and use every muscle. I feel like I get a better workout with leslie because it's easier for me to follow And I can feel in my muscles that it's just better",1423872000,5,910,4.0
5382233,3,B00A6B70DS,"I like the idea of this type of workout, it looks like a lot of fun and very easy to follow however, the case came cracked and broken and all 3 of the DVDs looked scratched and they are supposed to be new... I would have preferred an item that at least LOOKS new!!!",1422230400,,265,3.925925925925926
5382234,5,B00A6B70DS,"I really enjoy this workout.  I took Polynesian dance lessons for many years, so it was easier for me to follow than some, but I have shared it with friends who have no experience and they loved it too.  I actually wanted more than what was on these DVD's after doing them for a while. Since there were no classes in my area, I took the training and became an instructor. Now I teach a class once a week.
When I started I was really unfit.  I loved formats like Zumba, but with all of my excess weight could not really keep up.  This workout is very low impact so I was able to keep up with it.  I have lost over 30lbs and nearly 3 years after I started still loving it. Of course I also enjoy other workouts, but this is one I always come back too.",1422057600,3,749,4.0

5382236,5,B00A6B70DS,This is so much fun to do! Anna also does a great job explaining how to perform the moves and she also goes slower than a lot of other tutorials do. It looks easy but does really give a good workout!  I also love how encouraging Anna is! I can imagine though that this would be hard on your knees so if you have knee trouble I would pass...,1418515200,5,340,3.927536231884058

5382239,5,B00A6B70DS,"This is SOO much fun and way easier to follow than zumba. I love zumba, but have some friends who won't do it with me because it's too complicated, but they'll do these dvds with me any time. You move almost slowly for most of it, but if you're really trying to move like Anna-Rita Sloss, you'll be sweating before you get to the run through. That lady has some insane muscles in her legs, and she's super hot even with her stretch marks, and that makes me feel like I could be super hot with my stretch marks, too. She's so fun you'll want to get everybody hooked with you. You'll get an awesome post-workout high and feel a little sexier. There's a thigh work section that reminds me of a traditional dance that my old neighbors who were Samoan did. I don't know what to call that part besides Holy Moly My Thighs Are On Fire. Like I'll actually angrily grunt. But that part's short and worth it if I can get super thigh muscles like hers. I remember reviewers saying her daughter's weird and uncoordinated and distracting, but I didn't get that. I was having fun and she didn't bother me. (I think I'd look weird doing a sexy dance in front of my mom.) The second dvd has a chubbier girl who does all the hip circles double time and I get a little hypnotized by her more so than the thinner girl doing the same thing. My guess is the point of that is anybody can do this and have fun and get a moderate work out. Without shoes. :)",1412208000,6,1433,4.214545454545455

5382245,5,B00A6B70DS,"The four basic moves and the other moves, such as the warrior stance, are Tahitian - which is not Hula but rather an Aparima or Tamure movements.  That being said - I loved Anna-Rita's story and can relate.  Same poundage has been my lot in life since I've stopped dancing the South Pacific culture:  Hawaiian, Tongan, Samoan, Maori, and Tahitian - never learned Fijian cultural dances.  I've been using the DVDs to get my groove on again.  Love the drums - could just listen to the them all day - they take me back to family and my culture.

Each phase of the beginner workout shows the four basic moves, after doing them repeatedly and at different tempos...WOW...  I am sweating and feeling the burn.

If you are on the fence about buying this dvd, JUMP off and buy it!  I HIGHLY recommend it.  I'm so looking forward to the advanced dance workouts.

5382255,4,B00A6B70DS,I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed doing Hot Hula... its fun even if you're just learning the basics ...the music is great and Anna-Rita breaks down the moves at the beginning of the dvd and throughout the workout. I would have given this five stars but the dvd doesn't flow from one section to the next so instead of dancing right through as a continuous workout - you have go back to the main menu to hit the next dance. I would purchase it again - it's definitely a good workout.,1376611200,2,492,4.24468085106383
5382256,5,B00A6B70DS,"My first experience with Hot Hula Fitness was at my dance studio with primarily Zumba classes. They added a Hot Hula class once a week. I gave it a try, liked it, but was terrible at it. My instructor was soooo beautiful, graceful, toned and made this look easy. With a class once a week i felt like i wasn't getting better at this. My instructor said i was, but i wanted to practice at home. I internet searched Hot Hula fitness and found You Tube videos and found out about the Hot Hula videos on Amazon. Ok, there's  videos out there. So i put the video in my Amazon cart. Thank you Amazon for the reminders the video is in my cart. Well the unthinkable  happened my Hot Hula class has been cancelled. Great. So i ordered my video and have been doing my beginner video 2 to 3 times a week for about a month. I'm getting it. My core strength must be getting stronger, because i am doing this! I am going to stick with my beginner video until i am proficient with my work out. I have viewed the intermediate and can't wait to move up. Oh, and the bonus, my clothes are starting to fit different. Waist line, muffin top and back bra line, it's toning! I feel stronger and i love the way the clothes are fitting.",1376611200,6,1211,4.1931330472103

5382260,4,B00A6B70DS,"I'm a beginner, so I like the way Anna-Rita has a segment on just the form of the moves.  She takes extra pains to make sure we understand by showing all sides, back and front with a lot of repetition.

5382261,4,B00A6B70DS,"I was born and raised in Hawaii and competed and performed hula regularly until I left for college in the mainland almost 15 years ago.  I've been wanting to get back in shape but I don't have time to got to a gym or classes so I thought I'd give this a try.  I watched a portion of the beginner and decided to skip it and did the intermediate and advanced both on the first night.  Her daughter dances in the beginner and intermediate and is a little off beat and kind of distracting for me.  If you're looking for traditional hula, this is not it.  It's more of a poly-fusion workout with hiphop.  I do like it better than the island girl videos which I've had for a while.

I do the workout about 4 nights a week and my muscle memory is very good so I can already see a difference after 2 weeks.  If you're new, take it slow and focus more on mastering form.  The real workout comes from doing the moves correctly which forces you to tighten your core (as a child I was always told to think of my upper body as a tree trunk and ground it).  Once you force yourself to use your core, you will see big changes.  I've upped the challenge with hip and wrist weights as well.  Wish there were more variations in workout because of the price, but I do enjoy it.",1363910400,19,1258,4.110655737704918
5382262,5,B00A6B70DS,"I bought this set about a month ago. I have done it approximately once a week since my purchase and I have lost one inch around my waist. I know it doesn't sound like much, but it is a lot to me. I have not been a big fan of exercise nor workout videos. However, I was inspired by Anna-Rita's story, and saw how much she has changed over the years. I understand it is a process and I am looking forward to seeing more changes.

The DVDs are broken into beginner, intermediate and advanced. There are six chapters in each. The first chapter focuses on form. The second is warm up. The third is the moves you learned in the form with percussion. The fourth is the Siva which is the entire choreography put to either a reggae song or hip hop song. The fifth chapter focuses on some traditional legs and abs workouts. The final chapter is the cool down. I initially didn't like that you can't go from one chapter fluidly to another without it going back to the main menu. However, I find that after each chapter when it goes back to the main menu, it allows for a water break and allows time to towel down (because you will sweat).

Anna-Rita is highly motivating and encouraging throughout the DVDs. Her group is also enthusiastic and you will find that everyone keeps up extremely well. There is one young lady in the back I watch when I'm not focusing on Anna-Rita, and I tell myself, ""If she can do this, so can I.""

I got a friend of mine to do the beginner DVD with me once. She enjoyed it, but admitted it was definitely a workout - after the forms and warmup alone, we were sweating... by the end, we were laughing and completely drenched in sweat. I also my little sister to do this workout with me (a classically trained ballerina for over 10 years) and even she concluded it was a challenging leg and abdominal workout. At one point, she stopped and threw herself onto the bed and cried ""No more! This is crazy!"" I laughed because it was only the beginner DVD.

One thing to remember, is when you are watching, the moves seem like they will be a breeze and that you will not benefit from them at all. However when you are doing them, it is challenging and demands a lot from your core and your legs. I am looking forward to getting Hot Hula Sculpt DVD soon so I can tighten up my arms and I hope she releases the Hot Fusion workout soon.

I peaked at the intermediate DVD yesterday, and I will say, I know I am not ready for it yet. I can't wait until I am! I love what Hot Hula has done for me so far! It's fun and challenging, and for once it's a workout I look forward to doing.",1362355200,25,2588,4.199195171026157
