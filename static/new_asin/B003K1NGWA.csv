8398619,3,B003K1NGWA,"OK horror B film.  Based on The Most Dangerous Game, except that this time the madman is after a clutch of teenagers.  The quality of the film is not bad, though the Marengo DVD is better.  The cover art is the original poster, which I prefer,  but not the best quality.  Recommended for fans of this genre.",1379635200,,307,4.315789473684211
