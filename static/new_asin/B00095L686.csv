8291112,3,B00095L686,"This film has three things going for it: Aoi Miyazaki, Kumiko Aso, and a great soundtrack. Miyazaki and Aso are two of Japan's most talented and popular young actresses, and I'm always happy when a director shows good taste in music and uses it well--but the hip and evocative soundtrack used here sometimes seems a bit at odds with the slow paced art-house stylings of the film.

A Blue Automobile is a good looking film, very bleak, all stark and concrete. Indie actor cool dude Arata plays a young man who doesn't enjoy life because of an accident as a child that has left him scarred around the eyes. He plays an introverted danger-punk guy with occasional sunglasses, and we all know that fetching, young, good-hearted women are attracted to that type, so that's what plays out here.

I was intrigued by the characters as discreet units but wasn't able to engage the exposition of the characters' motivations toward one another. It's basically another story about a guy who gets two women. And this time they are sisters, which adds to the oh-so-intense nature of the angst. That there's a big theme of immense suffering lurking in the background all the time doesn't make it much more than that, except it does make it ""alternative"".

The film has many bright moments and solid acting. It's not mainstream fare by a long shot, but fans of any of the three leads should enjoy watching them do their stuff. The film wants to be more than it is but it really doesn't matter. I enjoyed the experience of the film. It's one of those where you give more points to journey than goal.",1357084800,,1582,4.622775800711744
