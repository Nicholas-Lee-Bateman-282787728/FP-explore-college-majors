1896646,5,B00009Y3N1,"This little-known 1983 film must have been shocking in its time.  It's about a young mother in an unhappy marriage to a college professor.  She begins an affair but the twist of this story is that the affair is with a female teacher.  She then has to cope with a broken marriage, the angst of her two children, and a whole new world of the lesbian subculture.  Add to this the fact that the older woman is not as anxious to commit to the relationship.  She doesn't want to be exposed as it would hurt her career and she also has a long-standing relationship with a woman in another state.  The young woman now finds that life is just as difficult for her as it was when she was married to her uncaring spouse.  There's high drama here, but it never turns maudlin.

Linda Griffiths is the young woman and she's great in the role of a woman who is suddenly cast into a lifestyle that is totally new to her.  Jane Hallaren is the older teacher in an excellent performance.  She, too, comes across as a troubled human being.  There are some very tender scenes between the two of them and they are touching and authentic.  I was moved by their dilemma and by their performances.

My highest accolades, however, go to John Sayles who wrote and directed it.  He even cast himself in a small role.  There's an extra feature on the DVD which features him discussing this film which is a perfect complement to the film itself.  Through the years, he has proven his talent for bringing out the many complex layers in seemingly simple situations.  He certainly did a great job with Lianna.  It's a really fine film.  Highly recommended.",1120262400,48,1624,4.462585034013605
1896647,5,B00009Y3N1,A terrific movie and one that any person concerned about relationships would enjoy and appreciate. I'd say that this and Desert Hearts are my two favorite lesbian movies.,1104278400,18,170,5.107142857142857
1896648,5,B00009Y3N1,"'Lianna' is one of the few John Sayles movies I literally had to wait years to see. Virtually buried for decades, all I knew about this film was the very tepid reviews I had read about it. Fortunately when it became affordably available I got to view it for the first time. I was expecting a rampant ""movie-of-the-week"" sentiment, but instead I saw a provocative, insightful film which felt far more like it was made last year, rather than in the early 80's. 'Lianna' is a bold, visionary film that is less about lesbianism per se than it is about the various reactions of the people in her life to her sexual awakening. It is a very passionate film experience which is less polished than Sayles later films, but has more emotion than I've experienced in all of his films combined.",1101168000,42,781,4.546099290780142

1896652,5,B00009Y3N1,"This is my favorite John Sayles film (which, considering how i feel about Lone Star, says a lot). This has much to do with Linda Griffith's wonderful performance as the title character. Sayles says his intention was to explore a situation where husband and wife divorce and the husband gets custody of the kids. This, of course, means something has to be ""wrong"" with the wife. At the same time, he didn't want her problem to be too impairing. Alcoholism and heroin addiction were out, so he made her a lesbian. When you consider the 1983 this is way ahead of its time and holds up well, especially against current films like But I'm a cheerleader. Good stuff.",1066608000,37,660,4.601694915254237
1896653,5,B00009Y3N1,"""Acclaimed writer/director"" John Sayles has been making some of the best films around for the last twenty years. MGM and IFC Films have just released three of his earliest to DVD for the first time, ""RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN"" (Sayles maiden directorial effort), ""THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET"" and this wonderful film, ""LIANNA"". The story of an unhappily married young woman named Lianna (beautifully played by Linda Griffiths)who discovers after eight years of marriage that she is a lesbian. She falls in love with an older woman, a night school teacher, and this leads to a seperation from her doofus of a husband and her two children. Lianna's oddyssey of self-discovery is endlessly fascinating and compelling. This film is a wonderful, witty, and warm human drama! For those of you tired of empty headed Hollywood blockbusters big on CGI effects, explosions, car chases, and cardboard characters, check out this film and some of Mr. Sayles other works. You will not be disappointed. His films are wonderful slices of life populated by believable characters. He is a true artist.
The picture and sound on the new DVD is quite good (the film having been recently restored). The disc features an insightful feature length audio commentary by John Sayles and a 9 minute featurette with on screen inverviews with Sayles and longtime partner producer Maggie Renzi. The trailer for Sayles latest film, ""CASA DE LOS BABYS"" is also included.
Highly recommended! -George Bauch",1063929600,97,1478,5.1115702479338845

1896655,5,B00009Y3N1,"Lianna is truly one of those movies that draws the viewer into the character's life immediately; However, this is at a time when writers of scripts had real raw talent and told stories very well. The movie goes inside of some of the aspects of the lesbian lifestyle and the woman is curious, well curiosity does kill her cat! It shows the inside of a marriage of not being satisfied and experiencing infidelity. Then, the love relationship between the women shows some promise until something happens. One needs a shoulder to cry on. Great movie, and will watch it again. This movie is recommended.",1402704000,3,598,4.759615384615385

""Lianna"" was limited release and I never did get to watch it, but 31 years later I finally saw it thanks to Amazon.  I recommend this movie.  It helped me appreciate how far we have come as a society.  I was touched by the scene where the football coach talks about the African American halfback who is an amazing runner, but who is also gay.  He said that didn't matter to him, he was a great football player.  For that to be written and said in a movie in 1983 is incredible.  The main plot of the movie deals with a woman, her husband and kids, and her new lover, a woman.  It's a believable story and is both happy and sad at different times.

1896667,3,B00009Y3N1,"I really like John Sayles' movies. This one grabbed my attention but the time period was distracting...I don't know if this was how women's bars really were but it seems a sad lot for Lianna's prospects. Also interesting is how the gay culture was so much more repressed. I really couldn't understand how Lianna could just leave her kids, either, even to explore her sexuality. I thought that was a sad choice to have to make, and not very empowering for her ultimately. Her husband got to speak to the kids about what was going on and it seemed to create a rift with the relationship with her daughter. I wish she could have been a stronger representation for taking control of her life and sexuality and maintaining her relationships with her children in a more loving way.

Now what  do I do? First love. The Well of Loneliness?  How to make one's way in a different world?
The search for acceptance. That's the big issue in this movie, the one that won't go away or ever change, which is why I would put this in the classic section of the library. Some things are timeless. Those straight friends who suddenly start to question everything. Some of those friends disappear and that's what hurts the most. As such I would recommend this movie to those close friends who might wonder.
The search for new friends and acceptance of self. The big issues.
For me, the love scenes focus more on the real than fantastic and have a sense of that same acceptance and joy which is nice.",1387929600,,1070,4.4213197969543145

1896673,4,B00009Y3N1,"Others have noted that in many ways, this film isn't about lesbianism. And yet...

In many ways, it really is. I was still in high school when this film came out and frankly, as a naive teen I really didn't know much about sexual relationships at all, never mind those outside the mainstream. So I can't really say for sure that this movie captures the reality of the day.

But I suspect it does. The movie rings true in its consistent presentation of the issues surrounding a housewife discovering that not only does she not love her husband, but that she loves women. We have a long way to go before society is completely non-judgmental about any number of personal lifestyle choices that harm no one, including sexual orientation. But it's reassuring to see just how different times were thirty years ago from today, as it shows things can and do change given enough time.

Sadly, some of what makes this story work (i.e. all the things unrelated to lesbianism) probably still happen all too often today. A philandering spouse, small-town politics and gossip, and of course the difficulty of explaining to one's children why and how their parents could split up and yet still love them every bit as much as they used to.

But at the very least, it's safe to say that if such a scandal occurred today, the fact that the couple was lesbian would have much less impact, and in fact in most communities would be a complete non-issue (at least at that level...of course, there will always be individuals with certain views, but as community standards change, those individuals tend to keep their views more to themselves).

This movie does address and present in detail a number of issues related to the lesbian affair, many of which seem very unfair by todays standards but I'm guessing at the time most people would have much less sympathy for the wife in the story. Even as sympathetically as the movie presents her.

So, while the movie apparently got good reviews even back in 1983, today it's still just as watchable and yet provides more layers of interest, due to the ability to view the story in hindsight. Well worth the time.",1383091200,,2134,4.677333333333333

1896684,4,B00009Y3N1,"John Sayles has had a remarkable career. After writing the ""Piranha"" script for Roger Corman, he turned right around and both wrote and directed ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven."" This must have impressed a lot of people, as Hollywood remade it as ""The Big Chill"" which had a bigger budget, higher priced cast and a much larger return at the box office. Anyway....""Lianna"" was his second effort and it's difficult to imagine a better film being made on the paltry $300,000.00 supporting it.

Here's the scoop. Lianna has married one of her college profs. Now, some years and two children later, things aren't going all that well. Hubby is still in the habit of boinking students and she's ticked. The emotional turmoil is also resurrecting feelings she's had since a young girl for her attraction to other women. This is exacerbated by the fact she's feeling attracted to a teacher she has in a class she's taking. The feeling becomes mutual and the ensuing relationship opens up a can of worms on many fronts.

As in any good/great indy film, this starts with the script. Sayles really seems to get what this is all about. A woman approaching middle age realizes she's lesbian and doesn't know how to handle it. Friends see her differently and she's not certain how open she can be about it due to its social stigma. Her husband's a jerk and will use it as leverage against her with their kids. What will happen to her relationship with her kids? The daughter is confused and the son is quite glib and might be becoming more like his dad. Then there's the feelings of love she has for her new girlfriend but that's upset by her wanting to explore her new found sexuality. Many things come into play and the script handles them very well.

The budget allowed for only the most basic of approaches to getting this puppy in the can but it all still works just fine. The sets, wardrobe, sound and other production values are all good enough to further the plot. The principal actors all do a decent job and all went on to have decent, if not very good, careers. I originally saw this on VHS on a CRT and it was pretty rough. This new version is remastered and, seeing it on an HD set, has given it a really great look. There are minor quibbles one might have about this, that or the other thing, but they are small distractions to a truly outstanding film.",1354147200,,2354,4.52112676056338

Its good to see a movie without the usual lesbian drama. The husband did not make me happy but I don't want to include any spoilers.",1347840000,2,419,4.3164556962025316
1896687,5,B00009Y3N1,"If you are seeking a ""lesbian"" movie, it's probably a safe bet you will be disappointed. But, then, you would be missing the real point of the movie, which is a tale of spiritual (not sexual) repression, and how if you do take a chance and pursue the path you believe you should be on, it can backfire. It's also provides some glimmer of hope when it comes to picking up the pieces ones choices, however well intentioned, change life in unintended ways.

This is an early John Sayles work (he even has a role in the movie), so it's interesting to observe his earlier writing and directing styles. It's also surprising to see that he still uses the main elements of those styles in his storytelling up to this day - and very successfully.

I personally found the characters to be believable, and while the acting was not Oscar material, it got the story across. The scope of the story is relatively narrow compared to Sayles' later work, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lone-Star/dp/B00002E20R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lone Star</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine-State/dp/B00006L926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine State</a>. Considerably so, in fact, but the dialog and pacing are pure John Sayles.

The story itself is one to which I can relate - not within the context of sexual orientation choices, but feeling constrained or diminished by the status quo, seizing what looks like a viable opportunity, only to discover that the manner in which it was seized was more impulsive than rational, and the consequences were not pleasant. I am sure many of us have gone through similar cycles, and the glimmer of hope Lianna saw at the very end when she started pulling things together is a message in itself. So, for me personally, this movie was both entertaining and one that touched a few nerves. Viewed in that context, you may find it to be enjoyable and possibly inspiring. You won't, however, find it salacious.",1335312000,7,2031,5.400630914826499
1896688,1,B00009Y3N1,This is one of the worst films I have ever watched. We actually saw this in a theatre in Boston while on vacation many years ago. We were excited to see a lesbian film. In those days they were rare. Even more so to be played in a mainstream cinema. I wish I had asked for a refund for our tickets. The film Clare de moon is on the top of the worst lesbian films ever made. Back then I guess it was considered acceptable and on the edge as people were still very much in the closet.

There's no dialogue just staring, spacing, zoning, daydreaming, head shaking, pick up phone.....put down phone.....it made me want to yell at my TV set ""quick.....somebody.....anybody throw her a line""! Then there are the trists, the conflicts, and the unconvincing sex scenes.....just awful contrived scenes! I guess if your a hardcore Lesbian then maybe anything with women using crude and vulgar references to sex acts is stimulating to you but for us straight people (yes there are some left) this was just boring on every level. I say dub it in French and show it at a seedy art house in the Village and maybe it will find it's audience.

1896692,4,B00009Y3N1,"I love this movie and am a big admirer of John Sayles. One of the most moving parts of ""Lianna"" is the Otis Redding duet. I can't believe that none of the previous reviews mentioned that particular segment. Usually the films of John Sayles are rather heavy on dialogue. During the Otis Redding duet there is no dialogue but it is a profoundly moving scene. Other than that, I can't think of anything else to add to the comments of previous reviewers. If you like John Sayles you should love ""Lianna.""",1184889600,3,500,4.5054945054945055
1896693,4,B00009Y3N1,"Film is more about personal discovery than a love story, Lianna at first seems frivolous almost selfish but as the film progresses she becomes stronger and gains a peronality. A realistic story of self discovery. The reactions of those around her makes for further depth. Although rather dated I would recommend as the quality makes it fairly timeless",1129420800,14,351,5.068965517241379

7994188,3,B00009Y3N1,"I wondered what the sexually orientation of the writer who wrote this is.  I wonder if this is written by a straight person and their ""new acceptance of lesbians"".  The writer did addressed some misconceptions of homosexuality in this film, but the ending is confusing. The straight friend has the idea that lesbians all walk around and when they come upon a woman they automatically think of them as a sex object. The straight friend begins to remember all the times that she had touch her friend or her friend touch her and begins to analyze the implications of those actions.  The misconception of straight women of lesbians out in the world is that a lesbian can hardly be friends with a straight woman without thinking of the other in terms of sex--therefore a vampire of some sort.  In the ending of the film, it is not made entirely clear what the straight person thinks. The straight woman does say that she is not gay to the lesbian friend but then she is holding her and taking the hair out of her lesbian friend's eyes tenderly.  Why would it be so necessary for the straight friend to declare that she is straight unless she was fearful of catching it so speak. If this was written by a lesbian...hmmmm.",1480204800,,1215,4.555045871559633
