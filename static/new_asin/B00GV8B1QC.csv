6118742,3,B00GV8B1QC,"My daughter has dyslexia and I was interested in this video! The first part about the parents reactions, frustrations, etc. before they learned of the dyslexia issue really hit home for me. This was the EXACT same experience we had with our daughter. This really validated the experience for me. That's why I gave it 3 stars. However, the video really started pushing a certain type of teaching/coaching and it just seemed to me to turn into a commercial. That turned me off and I didn't finish the film after about 5 people had high accolades for this method.  I am using various methods to help her and have a wonderful elementary school she is attending who has put her into the 504 program and is working with her, which has helped. This method may be great, but this is my review of the film - not the method.",1388534400,2,814,4.4630872483221475

6118758,3,B00GV8B1QC,"I think this movie is good first step into dyslexia. I wish it showcased the person overcoming the struggles of dyslexia instead of focusing so much on the parents.

6118759,5,B00GV8B1QC,"I'm dyslexic, dare I say was dyslexic. For parents with children who suffer from dyslexia let me begin by saying there is tons of hope for you're children; I'm proof. As a child early in elementary school I was diagnosed with dyslexia. I am writing this review from my apartment surrounded by literally hundreds of books that I have read.

 If you're child has been diagnosed with dyslexia get that child the scientifically proven instruction as my parents did for me approximately 30 years ago. Do many of the things recommended in this video and you will see dramatic improvements in you're child. I will not state in this review everything I went through except to say that I empathized with everything said in this video especially by those who suffered from the disorder themselves.

I remember crying doing home work as a child. But one little tip that helped me was once the special ed. teachers laid the foundation whereby I could begin to help myself reading comic books as a child helped my reading abilities take flight. There is no need for any child to suffer.",1455494400,2,1073,4.696808510638298

6118772,5,B00GV8B1QC,This is probably the most down-to-earth and well explained video about dyslexia which pertains to current times. I am an educator and the mother of a dyslexic child and this is a great overview for any educator and any parents to watch.,1451174400,,236,4.642857142857143

6118774,4,B00GV8B1QC,"What this film does not go into--it's really a different subject--is that educators are not TRAINED to work with children with dyslexia.  Oh, yes, a school can make accommodations for your child; however, if you want your dyslexic children properly taught, we educators are woefully unqualified.  I find it very frustrating, as an educator, that we are not trained as to what dyslexia is, some ways of recognizing it (so we don't simply write a child off as lazy), and some simple ways we can work with dyslexic children in the classroom.",1443312000,,538,4.836956521739131

6118779,5,B00GV8B1QC,"Embracing Dyslexia is fantastic and informative.  The documentary focuses not only on helping parents and educators understand dyslexia, but it also considers progressive and much needed policy reform.  I highly recommend Embracing Dyslexia to any person interested in advocating for different learners.",1419292800,,303,6.190476190476191

6118801,4,B00GV8B1QC,"Good film that includes many different experts in the field. Great to watch if newly diagnosed. But if you are an experienced dyslexic family, you have already searched out these experts. Still a good reminder.",1409443200,,210,5.0285714285714285
6118802,1,B00GV8B1QC,"If you are looking for information that really explains what Dyslexia is. This doesn't.  The film tells what dyslexia isn't, and then the rest of the film is mostly parents stories of their children.  The documentary does interview professionals, but the information is so vague.  They say that it is important for the child to get intervention with dyslexia educated tutors, and that you will probably need to go outside the school for that help, but no where did the film give any direction of where to go for good testing, or where to go for specialized help.  All it was about is how schools and teachers do not know what dyslexia is and that dyslexic kids are not getting the correct help because of that. Great I understand that, but how about some real direction in getting the correct help. Don't waste your time with this film.",1397260800,10,836,4.628378378378378

6118806,5,B00GV8B1QC,"I think knowing someone who is Dyslexic made me really embrace this film w/ open eyes and an open heart; it's challenging for children and teachers and society as a whole to feel confident if everyone is on a different page (pun intended!) I like that this video offers hope, encourages early testing, embraces the beauty of those w/ this neurological blessing and helps to illustrate that this is just a ""fact"" not a hindering reality.  I think one of the most powerful moment in the film is when an artist talks about living w/ Dyslexia, and how his learning ""stopped"" and when - so sad; I think one of my most favorite parts of the film was when one of the professionals illustrated the common traits of people with Dyslexia.....how they are good at sports and are risk takers - and how they can seriously be ABSOLUTELY anything and how parents helped to uplift their child's self esteem by helping them see how people w/ Dyslexia are living amazing lives......in all walks of life!  My wish is that schools that offer degrees in ""teaching"" help to show this video, and spread it's positive and empowering message to the masses.",1389225600,,1131,4.65

6118808,5,B00GV8B1QC,"This is an excellent resource for parents, teachers, physicians and therapists who either need more information on dyslexia, are not sure why their child has difficulties in school etc. This video should be a must see for teachers and physicians who often are misinformed.",1388793600,,272,5.204545454545454
6118809,5,B00GV8B1QC,"If your son or daughter is having issues with reading and/or spelling, especially if you have concerns about their reading/spelling ability and then beyond especially if they're in 3rd grade or higher and still having issues . . . WATCH THIS documentary.  If your child has been diagnosed with dyslexia, watch this documentary.  If you're a concerned educator K - 12 then you need to watch this documentary, so you can recognize when one of your students may be struggling with dyslexia, which is keeping them from reaching their potential.  And, if you're a politician you need to watch this film to understand the need for legislative changes that need to be made for legal recognition of dyslexia (our state does NOT recognize dyslexia) and in the educational standards for teachers and school psychologists to be trained in the recognition of dyslexia in their students.  My son has dyslexia, but before diagnosis we were told: it's just a phase; he'll get through it; there's nothing wrong with him, some kids just pick up reading sooner than others; he just needs to WORK HARDER at reading; you need to work harder and spend more time with him and his reading; your son is simply being LAZY.  If you've heard ANY of these things, especially WORK HARDER and LAZY, and your child is having issues with reading/spelling WATCH THIS FILM.  Even when we brought up the possibility of dyslexia to his teachers, we were again given these same answers from multiple teachers and unfortunately for years we believed the WORK HARDER advice. This film starts with parents relating their same/similar struggles before their children were diagnosed with dyslexia.  This film shows the opinions, facts, myths, strengths and challenges faced by dyslexic children and the their parents by showing interviews with parents of dyslexic children, adult dyslexics who faced the challenges and dyslexia specialists.  Further, it goes on to talk about the need for changes in legislation, teacher and professional education for greater recognition of dyslexia.  In our initial meeting and interview with the school psychologist who first evaluated our son we brought up the possibility of dyslexia.  After she did her complete evaluation she reported, ""There's nothing wrong with your son, he just NEEDS TO WORK HARDER.""  Further, this same psychologist told us that she had to look up dyslexia on the Internet, because she really didn't know what it was when we came to her mentioning it as a possibility.  After that we ended up talking to one of the professionals that happens to be interviewed in this documentary and she directed us to a psychologist who was also a dyslexia specialist.  After being properly evaluated by a professional that knows the proper testing methods for dyslexia - we found out that our son did indeed have dyslexia.  Armed with that diagnosis we then started taking the proper steps to help him with the challenges of dyslexia AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES once you know what it is and can take steps to help your child with the challenges.  I disagree with the previous reviewer who stated that it was an ad for a particular method (though Orton-Gillingham is discussed and presented by three of the professionals in the ""tutoring"" section of this film as a solution that can help, I feel that that the previous reviewer was incorrect in calling this an ad).  The entire family watched this documentary and my son who has dyslexia stated that he kept waiting to hear from the kids with dyslexia, which never happens.  He said that if the kids had been interviewed that would have made the film perfect for him.  This is a wonderful documentary, not perfect, but as a parent of a dyslexic I highly recommend you WATCH IT NOW.",1388620800,7,3739,4.907936507936508
8627724,1,B00GV8B1QC,"Rented this from my public library. I was hoping that it would help me find better insight into my child's diagnoses, maybe give me ways to help her achieve the high goals that she has for herself. I DO NOT FEEL ANY BETTER! In fact I feel even worse and more hopeless from this documentary. I don't know of it's the claim that children with Dyslexia rarely read past a 3rd grade level, or that artist who makes beautiful work talking about how he would love to design aircraft but lacks the ability to get an education to help him achieve his dream. I want to cry for my child. I'm glad that my child didn't watch the video with me like I had intended her to. The only useful glimmer of hope is the experts mentioning a reading system that has shown some promising results. Over all this documentary was terrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is in fear, or confused about how to help keep their child from falling through the cracks.",1527638400,,943,4.363636363636363
8627725,5,B00GV8B1QC,"This isn't an all encompassing course on dyslexia but it is a wonderful and informative call to arms for teachers and parents.  I found the Orton Gillingham reading method this year for the first time, and for the first time in his life, my almost 14 year old is learning to read.  I think this video is very successful in reaching the goals the creators set. Every teacher...no, every person involved in the education system and every parent of a struggling reader should watch this video and then go on to do more research on dyslexia.  These bright children deserve a chance to learn.",1519084800,,587,4.625
8627726,2,B00GV8B1QC,"Opinionated and had an agenda without actually explaining what dyslexia is.  Repeatedly said that people misunderstand dyslexia without making an effort to clarify.  Left me with far more questions than answers.  The people in the video kept arguing that teachers should have a course in what it is, which is rather impractical.  I agree more time should be spent on it, but an entire course would most certainly be overkill.",1517443200,,425,5.0285714285714285
8627727,1,B00GV8B1QC,"As a Special Education teacher and as a wife to a man with Dyslexia I was excited to see this documentary.  I stopped watching it when the lady said, ""Dyslexia is not a problem with the eyes. Dyslexia cannot be fixed with colored lenses or overlays.""  I wonder if she has lived/worked with a person who has Scotopic Sensitivity Dyslexia.  I can tell you that while it may not be 100% a problem with the eyes, it is real and it does impact people every single day.  I am sorry, but I refuse to watch the rest of this.",1509148800,,516,4.181818181818182
8627728,4,B00GV8B1QC,"This positive primer appears ideal for  parents, educators, policy makers, and any and all folks seeking  a good rudimentary understanding of dyslexia. It also offers considerable guidance for appropriate steps to take once a child is diagnosed. But probably most important is the doc's focus on dyslexia as a different organization of a very good brain and it's recommendation that very positive language be employed in dealing with kids who've often been told they're dumb or lazy. They are not in the least. Individuals with dyslexia are often exceedingly bright and creative and, given the right tools and support early on, are extremely successful in a wide range of professions. Their propensity for healthy risk-taking often leads to entrepreneurial pursuits and achievement; 35 % of entrepreneurs are dyslexic. An interesting informative doc and a valuable resource.",1486080000,,874,5.419117647058823
