8237110,4,B00104XYIU,"I read a booklet called Change of Heart.  They mentioned in the book that they attended a seminar in the Bahamas with Tony Robbins that changed the course of their marriage, and this is what the booklet is about.  I picked this DVD (with CD) up at the library as a result.  I just got done watching it and I LOVED IT!!  The Booklet was good to get to the issues and change the way you deal with your spouse so that love can flow, but seeing this DVD... where the couple who wrote the Change of Heart booklet were right there, experiencing the change before my eyes, was amazing!  I now have useful tools (from the book, cd & this DVD) to change and improve my relationship!  THANK YOU TONY ROBBINS!  It just may save my marriage.",1321747200,6,729,4.239130434782608
