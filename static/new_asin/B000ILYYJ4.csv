8146115,5,B000ILYYJ4,"I hear there is a season three in japan. WE have not gotten the last three discs in season two because Geneon has gone out of business. This series is full of fun and adventure and possible yaoi content. If you love ""traveling from our world to a prallel world"" type stories, like the 12 kingdoms, or Seryou, or even El-Hazard and other such stories, then this is the best series you can watch and buy. Send e-mails to your favorite dvd companies and get them to license the rest of Kyou Kara Maou. God save our King- You the fan can save this series! :D Rent it, purchase it, write letters, beg for Kyou Kara Maou to entertain us again on dvd collections, everywhere!",1209254400,,668,4.352
8146116,4,B000ILYYJ4,In the first volume of the second season things start off quickly.  The questions about what Conrad is doing and why are the first things addressed.  It does bring some resolution but not completely.  Next Yuuri's older brother is finally introduced.  I enjoyed the focus and how it showed Shori's personality and his relationship with Yuuri.  The last episode was a simple stand alone one that focused on one of the lesser-used characters in the series and the power that can actually be wielded by the Demon Tribe.  This volume had everything that made the first season enjoyable and a few new insights that are sure to be developed.,1168300800,7,635,4.779816513761468
