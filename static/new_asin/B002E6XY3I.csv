These films encourage them to stand strong no matter the cost. This is a great film. I not only enjoyed the animation, but also the adult documentary that follows. We highly recommend all of the dvd's in this set.",1338768000,,377,4.7272727272727275
3915657,5,B002E6XY3I,"Although intended for children, adults would greatly benefit from this, also. It is sad that so many of our children and adults know all about the current popular music, movies, athletes, and other entertainers, but know so little about the Bible and Godly men, women, and children throughout history. We should all know about the life and death of Perpetua--an early Christian martyr. Some of the reviews said that this dvd is not for children. I greatly disagree--unless one wants to shield children from the truth of what it means to live for Jesus. If this is the case, one would not want to teach children much of the Bible, either. Our two girls, aged 2 and 4 watched this story of Perpetua with us. While the story made us sad to see Perpetua's persecution, nothing graphic was shown, but what happened was implied and told. We were glad to have the opportunity to explain to our children just what it means to be a Christian, how many have given their lives simply for loving Jesus, and how many today all over the world are still enduring persecution. I recemmend this for all. Those who love Jesus will be drawn closer to Him and appreciate Perpetua. Those lukewarm Christians may realize that they need to count the cost of being a disciple of Jesus and live fully for Him.",1337558400,4,1284,4.611353711790393
3915658,4,B002E6XY3I,"This was an excellent story!  My one complaint is that it didn't specify that Perpetua WAS married,  so it caused some confusion while watching it. That's why I took a star off.  I see no reason not to buy it!",1304380800,,209,4.175
3915659,5,B002E6XY3I,"If you have sensative kids, watch it alone before you share it with them. To be honest, it is probably our responsibility to watch anything we purchase our kids before showing them. Especially when the content is teaching them about Christ.

With that being said, I believe that educating our children on the heros of the faith and the very real persecution that not only exists today, but is fastly growing all over the world, is extremely important. An average of 270 Christians die every day all over the world for their faith. More Christians exist now than in all of Christian history and many nations are making war on Christianity.

If all we share with our kids is a prosperity gospel, how are we preparing them for the realities of following Jesus? Even if they never encounter that kind of persecution, there are other kinds which are easier to endure when you know the body of Christ has endured far worse.

Pray, pre-watch it, and then know that it is a great film.

3915695,5,B002E6XY3I,"This movie is such a powerful gospel movie.  I love how Perpetua showed the strength of her God when she gave up her life in this world, to inherit eternal life with Jesus Christ.  I was deeply moved by this testimony, and encouraged greatly in my faith.  I am 34 years old, and was deeply moved, challenged, inspired, and encouraged by this movie.  I have been telling everyone about this.  I keep thinking about how the pastor, who willingly chose to go with the other christians to face the lions in the coliseum, rather than stay back and keep himself from death.  It was so powerful how they had a beautiful prayer meeting, and God gave them strength to face what was coming ahead.  It is such a comfort to know that even if we are called to lay down our lives at the hands of angry sinners, God will even still be with us in that terrible circumstance if we are abiding in the True and Living God, who is Jesus Christ.  Oh what a wonderful God and what a beautiful display of His work in a person's life.  Even if this was fictional, it would still be an encouragement, but the fact that it is based on a true historical account, makes it even more worthwhile.  Children need to see more movies like this.  There is so much wicked entertainment that parents put into their children's hearts and minds through the TV.  This is a beautiful refreshment, and more parents need to buy movies like this for their children.  This is a MUST SEE!!  It is rated as one of my TOP movies of all time.",1424390400,,1494,4.327338129496403

3915701,5,B002E6XY3I,"Of all the Torchlighters films that I have viewed, The Perpetua Story has been the most intense, and has left me the most thoughtful. Artistically, what I find impressive about this film is how closely it stays to Perpetua's actual prison diary, even drawing lines from the text. With that said, reading the text which was writing in Carthage around 200 AD, I felt the greater emphasis was on being a ""Christian""  rather than on the person of Jesus, Messiah Yeshua. In remaining integris to Perpetua's writing, the film takes the same course.  However, there are times when the characters express joy in sharing in His sufferings, which they endure with great honor.  The honor of martyrdom is one of the primary themes of this film.  Particularly, just before her martyrdom, Perpetua takes a moment to pin up her hair, because she does not want to die as a ""mourner in her time of triumph.""  The narrator describes her as ""radiant"".  Never once does Perpetua, or her small family in the faith complain about their conditions, rather, they praise the Lord through out and thank Him for this privilege.

This film covers topics that might be difficult for some children to understand within God's love.  Perpetua and Felicity, for example, have to chose between denying Christianity for the sake of their nursing babies, or remaining committed to their faith and dying for their beliefs.  The strain between Perpetua and her father is quite evident, as he tries to convince her to renounce her faith in favor of her family.  Perpetua and fellow prisoners are comforted by dreams and visions from the Lord while they are in prison.  Some believers might feel uncomfortable with this mystic sort of content, which has caused some bible scholars to have many discussions over the the theology held by this small group of believers.  The martyrdom they face in the end follows the eyewitness account added to Perpetua's writing.  The characters are tossed and mauled by live animals in a scene that my husband refers to as ""grizzly"".  The text describes Perpetua as awakening from an ""ecstasy in the spirit"", and asking ""When will we be thrown to that Hefer"" after it has already happened.  The animated film depicts this very scene, with Perpetua seeming to come out of a daze, which might bring up questions for some children.  Through out their attack, Perpetua takes time to help others and maintain an upright position, emphasizing honor and courage.  Eventually this brave band of believers each die by the sword.

The content is highly mature and I would seriously recommend previewing this film, then praying about whether or not your child is ready to view and  discuss such topics. If desiring to present this to a group of young students, I would recommend obtaining permission from the parents first.  It is one that I will save until my son is older, but it is also a story that reminds me to walk in honor when I'm persecuted for His namesake.

It is quite a powerful story that needs to be shared, just do so with wisdom and discretion.",1388188800,6,3046,4.796934865900383
3915702,2,B002E6XY3I,"This story was too depressing.... My daughter has others of the same makers, but this one I didn't like too much and neither did my daughter. Also didn't like that it has some biblical errors such as death leading to direct heaven entrance. There is no biblical reference to this happening every time someone dies. As Christians we should all know that when one dies the soul is resting and awaiting the second coming of or Lord Jesus Christ, when ""the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet them in the clouds."" 1 Thess. 4:16-17 What were the dead in Christ doing in their graves if they had already gone directly to heaven after dying? Obviously with the exception of those specific instances that the Bible mentions of God giving that privilege to certain individuals, and the saints that rose after Christ's death which remain unnamed, all others die and await the second coming. There are many many more Biblical references on the subject but the point is that for this reason and others we did not like it much.",1384387200,,1106,4.590909090909091
3915703,5,B002E6XY3I,"i studied Perpetua and Felicitas in college and loved their story. Now, as a church librarian, i am amazed on a weekly basis to see how our younger patrons gravitate toward this DVD. Not a week goes by without one or another of the kids asking me if they can watch this. They have seen it dozens of times, and it never gets old. It is far and away the most popular DVD in our collection, which includes other Torchlighters stories, a ton of VeggieTales, and several of the Max Lucado DVDs. i asked one once why she liked this one so much, and she expressed as a 9-year-old what i felt as a 20-year-old learning about Perpetua for the first time: She's so courageous, and even when she's given opportunities to deny her faith--even though her dad wants her to reject Christ and come home to her baby--she will not give in. i love seeing her joy as she trades her family, social status, and life for Christ and suffering, and i love that the kids are getting this. i cannot recommend this video enough.",1381881600,,1000,4.381720430107527

Yes, sensitive children may be upset, BUT...our 3 children ages 8-13 found it inspiring and we had a great discussion.  Obviously, it makes a difference how they have been exposed to this subject of persecution. We have always openly discussed it since the children were very young.

I do believe it is important for families to step up to the plate and prepare themselves for the very real fact that brothers and sisters around the world do not live in a ""fairy tale Christianity"" and the threat of torture and death is quite real for many.

3915710,5,B002E6XY3I,"My family (which consists of Mom, Dad, and us 3 teenage girls - no little kids among us, just for the record) just watched Torchlighters: The Perpetua Story. They illustrated the story of this martyr powerfully; the story was truly amazing and personally impacting and convicting, and it was very emotional. Don't get it in your head that this is some kiddie cartoon; this is a story about being brutally killed for standing up for Jesus Christ no matter WHAT, and even though they don't graphically portray the hideous bloodshed, they depict the events in a very emotional and well-done manner, so of course it'd be scary for a youngster. Overall, I highly recommend this beautiful portrayal of unfailing faith, and it's not at all kiddie or childish. It's something that even adults can learn a lot from.

Even though I obviously think this is very beautiful story that was portrayed extremely well, I by no means think this DVD is perfect. A few complaints:

- There were a few Narm-y moments (particularily when the Christians were being arrested - the animation just seemed cheap), and for those who don't know, that just means that there were a few moments that were supposed to be dramatic but ended up mildly amusing, usually (for this film) because of bad animation. However, like I clearly stated above, this was overall a very powerful 30-minute cartoon and usually made me feel the appropriate emotions - by the end, I certainly wasn't chuckling as I witnessed amazing faith even unto DEATH. So, overall, Narminess was rare and the film was powerful.

- The animation...well. It's not terrible, but not great, either. I think they used Flash. Problem is, sometimes they didn't draw enough frames and it simply didn't look smooth. (A frequent problem for people who use Flash, as they think ""I'm using Flash, so I can 'skimp' on frames""...sadly, it isn't so.) The animation certainly isn't terrible, but like I just mentioned, its imperfections created a bit of Narminess. But was this a film overwhelmed by Narm? No way, uh-uh, NOT AT ALL.

- Most people couldn't care less about this, but they depicted Jesus in animation for a few minutes in this film; I'm Reformed and don't think that depicting Jesus is a good idea, particularly since Jesus probably doesn't actually look like the pictures that are drawn of Him, and it puts the focus on the wrong thing - an (artificial) picture of what Jesus looks like instead of what we know about Him and what matters about Him: His Sonship, His deity, His humanity, His life, His death, His resurrection, His return. Of course, most people don't care and, while I was bothered, the film was NOT ruined!

Overall? This was a very impactive, emotional film - a beautiful story beautifully told. The animation wasn't perfect, but you know what? Overall, these problems were tiny in comparison to the good of the film. The animation will get better when more attention is paid to these DVDs, which are overall well-done and certainly worth the money (or trip to the library, in our case. :) Seriously, give this DVD a look!
