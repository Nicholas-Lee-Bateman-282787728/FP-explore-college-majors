3691996,4,B001LYRHSM,This product came very quickly and was well packaged. This was a very good follow up to the original Ace Ventura although I would have liked to have seen Jim Carrey in this one as well. I would recommend this seller to everyone.,1364256000,,228,4.325581395348837

3691998,3,B001LYRHSM,"Ace Ventura Jr. (2009) is a semi-sequel to Ace Ventura Pet Detective(1994) and Ace Ventura When Nature Calls(1995). It's the ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" of the series. Jim Carrey and Ace Ventura are only in it ""in spirit"". The film went straight to DVD and straight to the Cartoon Network in the U.S.A. Although, Ace Ventura Jr. did get a theatrical release in the Phillipines! This film received many bad reviews, but I had fun watching it. It's a solid kids film and it was well made with only a $7 million budget. Josh Flitter plays Ace Ventura Jr. Ultra-pretty Emma Lockhart(Batman Begins) plays Laura, Ace's love interest from school. Lockhart gives an earnest performance in a cheesy movie. Austin Rodgers plays a McLovin' look-a like. Ace Ventura Jr. searches for missing animals in the area. The stakes are raised when Ace's mother is framed for stealing a panda. Ace Ventura Jr. tries to emulate his father as the film progesses. Josh Flitter does a decent job playing Ace Ventura's son.
 Ace Ventura Jr. is campy and over the top, but it does have some fun and charm. The humor is a hit and miss affair. This film uses parts of Universal Studios Florida for sets. You can see the Twister Ride and parts of a Jurassic Park set. This film references everything from 300 to Star Trek to A Few Good Men. A mouse in this film is played by a rat! Rats are much larger than mice. David Mickey Evans directed Ace Ventura Jr. He also directed The Sandlot(1993). The last decade has also given us Son of the Mask(2005) and Dumb and Dumberer(2003), sequels and prequels to Jim Carrey movies that did not feature Jim Carrey.
Ace Ventura Jr. could have been a lot worse. Ace Ventura Jr. is ""so bad, it's good"".",1339977600,,1721,4.551612903225807
3691999,2,B001LYRHSM,"This was an ok idea, but done all wrong. If they HAD to make an Ace Ventura movie without Jim Carrey they should have made a prequel! They could have used an actor who resembled Jim (Actually Trevor Moore from ""Miss March"" would be perfect, as he looked and dressed like Ace in that film!). Even this film should have found a kid that looked more like Jim/Ace! This kid would make a better kid version of Seth from ""Superbad"" than the son of Ace Ventura! While not as awful as some have said, this movie isn't worth more than a $1 Redbox rent & rip!",1301529600,,549,4.188679245283019

3692001,1,B001LYRHSM,"Wow, who thought in Hollywood this would be a good idea? The movie ignores Ace Ventura SR for most of this dreadful film, hinting at him briefly. Then out of the blue, it's revealed that he is lost in the Bremuda triangle. The kid playing JR is a bad actor and shouldn't get anther role in Hollywood. The whole movie is just a mess with bad acting, bad camera work, and just a slap in the face to fans of the orignal film. Stay away from this, I saw it for free just to witness the train wreck.",1248739200,9,494,4.051020408163265
3692002,1,B001LYRHSM,"I know this is just a kids movie but that is not a reason for it to stink like this. And yes I actually saw this movie. I was curious to see this movie even though it reeks of a cheap cash-in on the name of Ace Ventura. I just wanted to see if it could stand on its own as a movie. It couldn't.

The movie details Ace Ventura Jr(supposedly the son of Ace Ventura)trying to free his mom from jail with accusation of a stolen panda. Stupidity and non-hilarity ensue.

So many things wrong with this movie but let me break it down this way.

Acting: Cheesy beyond belief. Its like the people in this movie live in an alternate world where Baby Geniuses 1 and 2 , Ed and Master Of Disguise are held in high regard so they use the same type of lame humor that those characters in those movies use and fall on their face just as hard. Joshua Flitter's character is only relegated to mimicking Jim Carrey's mannerisms from the original Ace Ventura movies. No originality there so lets move on.

Humor: When all you can rely on to be funny is pathetic pratfalls and slapstick that any kid has seen millions of times before you know you suck. Never has animals farting and Joshua Flitter bumbling around like some wannabe Leslie Nielson been so boring. I mean the jokes in this movie looks as if they were made up as the movie went along.

Storyline: Weak as hell. Is that the best the writer can come up with? I understand that this is a kids movie but Saturday morning cartoons(past and present) have better plots than that.

Conclusion: Ace Ventura is a certified bust written by idiots that perceive their young audience as idiots with jokes that nobody(kids or adults) would find funny. Somebody should have told the writers of this brainless fiasco that NOBODY LIKES SUPERBABIES, BABY GENIUSES, ED AND MASTER OF DISGUISE!!! Those movies were universally panned(and for a great reason I might add) so using the same type of witless humor will get you nowhere fast. Don't subject your kids to this sludge. There are far better family movies out there that are created by geniuses not hacks that think all kids(as well as their parents) are stupid neanderthals that deserve to be taken advantage of. I still cant believe that the same director that gave us the wonderful The Sandlot is responsible for this garbage. Every dog has its day I guess.",1237939200,13,2340,4.507075471698113
3692003,1,B001LYRHSM,"The original Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a childhood favorite! I love it! Now, they make a 3rd one where some kid tries to act like Jim Carrey! They are just trying to cash in on a franchise by stealing the name. I give this 1 star, and I would NOT recommend ACE VENTURA JR: PET DETECTIVE!!!",1236643200,4,293,4.157894736842105

8320179,5,B001LYRHSM,"I cannot believe that some people are complaining about this performance from this movie. Jim Carrey deserves Oscar for his performance in this poorly written but beautifully acted movie. I watched this move a few times over to see if they make a mistake or Jim isn't 100% IN DA ZONE but no! Single handedly put this movie on his back. Some people say he can't act dramatic roles but after seeing the versitility from him in this role, he's made a believer out of me. He's taken on a whole new attitude,  voice, body shape and even height! Amazing the preparation some people will go through even for straight to dvd, that's why the greats are great, commitment. 5 stars.",1441584000,,671,4.545454545454546

8320184,1,B001LYRHSM,"I saw the trailer and thought. Wow. This is so cheesy with little bit of too corny corn bread dipped in that cheese. That sounds weird, but the actor has no idea what he is doing. When he says ""Alrighty then!"" It has a completely different tone. It didn't make me laugh like it did when Jim Carrey said. In fact, when the kid says it, it doesnt make me laugh. At All. If you want to watch a good movie with good humor, watch Ace Ventura, Pet Detective, the ORIGINAL. The 2nd one is cool too. In all, definetly do NOT waste your time and money on this horrible rip off of Jim Carrey. Sorry Hollywood, but without Carrey, Ace Ventura, does not make me laugh. Good luck making money off of some kid who doesnt know how to act. Jeez, if I could I would give this film a quarter of a star. :-(",1396051200,2,788,4.0576923076923075
