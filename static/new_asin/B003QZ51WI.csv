4172120,5,B003QZ51WI,"As a jazz lover, I enjoy watching jazz concert DVDs; they're even better when the videos aren't in black and white. Roy Hargrove is one of the top contemporary jazz artists, and this DVD is the best jazz concert DVD I have encountered so far. Roy's melodic compositions are top notch. This is truly an album that you can really sit back and enjoy. The music is great, the camerawork is good, and you can tell that the band is really putting a piece of themselves into the performance. I hope it won't be too long until he makes his next concert DVD.",1352246400,6,549,4.339805825242719

8402717,4,B003QZ51WI,"Roy Hargrove and his crew swing hard on this set!  My kids and I really enjoyed this concert.  My kids are very young, but they love traditional jazz and especially Roy Hargrove.  I would give it a 5 star rating if it was a blu-ray.  The video could be better, but it's decent.  The sound quality is good as well.  I like the 2 channel audio better than the 5.1 option on my system.  Great concert and I would like to see more traditional jazz artist make concert dvd's.",1401235200,,470,4.213483146067416
8402718,5,B003QZ51WI,"Roy Hargrove is the most brilliant jazz trumpeter since Clifford Brown.  His tone can be warm or fierce.  His timing is impeccable, whether it be post- bop, afro- Cuban or a gentle ballad.  This DVD, recorded at the New Morning club in Paris, is a fine introduction to Mr. Hargrove's considerable skills.  As with all New Morning productions, the sound and visuals are excellent.",1399248000,,379,4.875
