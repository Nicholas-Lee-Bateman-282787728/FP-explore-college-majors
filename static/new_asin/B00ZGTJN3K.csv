7282806,4,B00ZGTJN3K,A thought provoking movie and another fine performance by Marcia Gay Harden.,1440374400,,76,5.416666666666667
7282807,3,B00ZGTJN3K,"The best of the movie is Costa Rica. The beauty of its nature and places. Marcia Gay Harden delivers a fair performance of a unconvincing and stereotypical character of a librerian that decides to take her life in a beautiful location. After watching the movie one asks oneself,  how could an Oscar-winer actress accept to play such a poor role of such a poor script?",1440201600,4,367,4.6461538461538465
7282808,5,B00ZGTJN3K,"Is sooooo loved this film!  Marcia Gay Harden gave a spectacular performance.  So believable.  I felt for her... so sad, so lost and so complicated until she takes the trip of a lifetime to Costa Rica.  Fell in love with Costa Rica, the characters and story... I would highly recommend AFTER WORDS!",1440115200,2,298,4.673076923076923
7282809,5,B00ZGTJN3K,"AFTER WORDS is a very well made and enjoyable film with terrific performances by Marcia Gay Harden, Oscar Jaenada, Jenna Ortega and the rest of the cast!  I recently caught a preview screening and was very impressed. Solid writing, direction, cinematography and great music.  The beautiful scenery of Costa Rica not only provides a perfect backdrop for the story, it inspires the viewer to break away from life's dull routines & grab the next flight to the tropics! Or at least get outside, see some fresh scenery, try something new and enjoy what life has to offer -- as they say in the film...Pura Vida!!",1439856000,11,606,4.761904761904762
7282810,5,B00ZGTJN3K,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I began to watch this movie, but I like Marcia & her acting a lot.  And that was enough reason.

But, when it came to watching - it brought up a lot of emotions for me.  And similarities.  Years ago, I went through a period of just 'bad stuff happening' all the time.  A car accident, a separation to divorce, another car wreck due to some A-holes being on the phone, Caretaking my mother, de-hoarding her house, and the added financial burdens.  Basically, Life went to crap - and I feel like I began to retreat from all the stress...and the fact that after she passed away, I was left with living in her home, in an area that I hate.  A quiet town, in the middle of nowhere worth mentioning.
NOT a place I would ever consider retiring.  And after 5 years...it seems that THAT is all I could expect.  I'm 65, not ready to throw in the towel.

I have had this amazing life, of travelling and moving to places on my own...and after all I went through, I have lost my sense of adventure :-( But not the Desire.  Only at times, it has been replaced with Fear of the unknown because of all I went through.  Before, I never gave changes a thought...but the past few years were never expected to be so bad, and I find myself more cautious.  And yes, almost considered suicide as the only ending.  Hard to think of that, when I have had so many wonderful exciting experiences.  AND those Experiences IS what has kept me wanting to LIVE.

This movie - for the lack of anything else...has offered me the courage to Get Out THERE, and try again.  I may not get a romance out of this, which would be lovely (I've been alone for 5 years after my divorce)...and in my mind, there's very lean pickings to finding an attractive man with some good sense and stability, at my age.  So I'm safer on my own.

And I've been smart enough to take care of myself in many ways.  But, IF I was to say anything in the end of all of my share - I'm going to take a trip by the end of the year.  Get my finances in order, and Hit the Road.  Find that woman who used to try everything, and see anything...and go out and get that Courage for Life again.

Thank you for making this movie - It really HIT Home for ME... emphasis on ME.",1477094400,3,2236,4.148837209302326

I would have liked to have seen more of what happens at the end but I think it is based on a book so there's only so much they can do there.

7282840,3,B00ZGTJN3K,"I give After Words 3 stars only because it is a great travel film about Costa Rica, showing off Costa Rica's beautiful Pacific coastline at Manuel Antonio and surrounding regions, and the gorgeous Caribbean coastline at Puerto Viejo. The alleged trip to Arenal Volcano was actually filmed in the Manuel Antonio area, so never mind that.
Other than being a lovely travel film, the story-line is terrible and the acting is very mediocre and wanting -- for which I would actually give this movie 1 star. A woman decides to kill herself over getting let go from her library job. Seriously? And decides to die in Costa Rica? I would think that if this woman was so distraught over losing her job she would just end it all in her own apartment and forget the vacation to die. And as for the male co-star, there are many very good Costa Rican actors, so why did the production choose Oscar Jaenada, who is terribly unbelievable and stilted in his acting, and trying to play off a Costa Rican accent when he's a Spaniard? The idea that a tour guide needs to be a prostitute to pay for his daughter's private school is lame. First off, tour guides in Manuel Antonio can easily make $300 in one day in high season, so paying $500 every 3 months for tuition would not be a big deal. There are some tour guides who like to womanize, but they are just womanizers, not gigolos.
To me, this film is incredibly demeaning to the very professional and knowledgeable tour guides who work in Costa Rica, most of whom are dedicated to conservation and protecting nature and wildlife in Costa Rica. They raise families just fine by being dedicated and working hard and providing tourists with memories of a lifetime, and without drinking beer at every opportunity and picking up single women.
Honestly, I think whoever wrote this script and the producers of this movie just wanted a paid trip to Costa Rica. They could have done a much better travel film and left out the ridiculous soap opera story.",1463443200,,1978,4.606232294617564

7282879,5,B00ZGTJN3K,"While viewing this film, I enjoyed the story of Jane (Marcia Gay Harden) as she is sent from the library where she was very comfortable in her work environment even being severely repressed and alone working in Los Angeles. She desires a vacant glimpse of what it is like to live for only a scant while in colorful surroundings to spark her interest. Jane wishes to find the flavor of a life with her eyes beyond the words she has always filled them with. When her job goes, so does she, off to Costa Rica with a horrible numbing depression to battle but a will to at least try to see this beauty if only for a bit of time.

When she arrives, she meets a young male tour guide who at first impression may seem the type that would do anything for money although this man has a more noble reason to try and make as much money as he can. Juan (Oscar Jaenada) is raising his daughter, Anna (Jenna Ortega), but mainly keeps her out of the picture for the most part as he is the guide hired by any tourists that come while he enjoys spreading enthusiasm, friendly conversation and has a genuine delight in this lovely place. This, he is excellent at and at taking a particularly committed along with a protective care of Jane who is anxious, quite nervous and obviously standoffish. His special interest in her grows because of her expansive mind of words, books and what intrigues him personally. Juan finds these traits fascinating making for a generous blend of the two very different personalities. A first extremely apprehensive Jane will have to slowly go along with Juan to see all of the loveliness she has only read about and now is wanting to view before all is 'said and done'.

Two of the reasons that this story pulled so much at me emotionally is because of the age of Jane and the predicament of Jane. She dismally accounts for her loneliness by saying, ""It's as if I received a shot that forever numbed me, only I gave myself that shot"". I immediately could understand and empathize with this sad woman who had given her whole life entirely to her work and neglected herself and primarily her own pleasure. Living alone (except for her cat), never going out, she lives the stereotypical life while holding herself back while remaining overly frightened of her own life stretched out in front of her.

It is in this way I could very much sympathize with Jane and understand her abundantly slow awakening to the lush beauty of Costa Rica. From the smog-ridden city where the stars at night are not even closely in view and the musty boredom of the library during her day in California, Jane finds the new country so vividly colorful all over and in every secluded corner, it is almost too much to take in at times. This slower paced and brightly atmospheric film was written and directed by Juan Feldman focusing greatly on the birth and awakening of a depressed and secluded woman's spirit. This also takes into view the middle age of a woman at the right place and at the right time along with the gentle coaxing and true friendship she is afforded.",1449273600,9,3059,4.518050541516246

7282898,2,B00ZGTJN3K,"The very talented Marcia Gay Harden is diminished by this role of Jane. It's the movie. It's very predictable, the plot uninspired-- Take the severely depressed lonely woman to Costa Rica to give her a new lease on life. It's a bit of My Fair Lady redux; rein in the hair, smarten the clothes, perk up the makeup.  She does enjoy the companionship of Juan but as this is also his job, we can't know for how long. Oscar Jaenada (Juan) does a good and credible job as the enthusiast, desirous of bringing pleasure into Jane's life.  Great scenery.  It just misses the mark.",1446249600,3,571,4.471153846153846

7282902,5,B00ZGTJN3K,"This movie was a surprise.  I didn't really know what to expect, so I got it on Netflix before ordering a copy.  It was a charming little movie, with a really good soundtrack and at the end, I found myself smiling, which means it was a nice cinematic escape.  The copy I had from Netflix had sound issues - the music was great, but the dialogue was so soft, I couldn't hear it.  The disc had subtitles, so I was able to read what the characters were saying, though I'm hoping the disc I order does not have that issue, because I'm sure it's even better when audible dialogue to go with the good background music.  Still giving it 5 stars for the charm factor...I enjoyed it.",1446076800,,674,4.275590551181103

7282908,4,B00ZGTJN3K,Thought this film was a beautiful take on the idea of a fresh start. Jane is a librarian struggling with depression. Afterwords handles the sensitive subjects of depression and suicide very elegantly yet accurately.
