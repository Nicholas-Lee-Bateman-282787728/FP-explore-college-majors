8247296,5,B0012Q72WK,"Best 3D film I ever, ever saw. Beyond belief. I saw this 9 times!!!

This needs to come to blu-ray and I would easily pay $100 for it. Hands-down here's my card!",1423785600,2,161,4.03125
8247297,5,B0012Q72WK,"For me the moment that really made me feel I was there was a camera pan around Larry Mullen, Jr. applying his trade at the drum set.  The camera moved in to the hidden little comfort table behind him.  An ice tea in a glass I could almost reach out and touch was ""dancing"".. vibrating resonating circles riveting outward to the shake of Larry's foot applied to the bass drum kick.

I have a 3D TV and would pay like $100 for this disc in 3D Bluray..

Let's go IMAX/U2.. do a deal!  I'm not getting any younger here!",1305590400,12,515,4.161616161616162
