7959849,1,B000063URA,"NOTE # 1:  Rick Wakeman DOES appear in the movie as a night receptionist at the hospital.

ALONE is another one of those ""artsy"" thrillers that insults the viewer's intelligence with overwrought bizarre visual images, a noisy soundtrack, and worst of all, it doesn't end.  That's right, the movie ends and you say WHAT?  You're not going to tell us who this wacko is???  What a rip!  And as in many other movies, this climax takes place in a hospital.  We see only one nurse, one orderly; no patients, no other staff.  Having spent time in hospitals, I know that at night they aren't as quiet as these movies make us believe.  There's always a lot of yapping with the nursing and housekeeping staff; the assistants.  But writers insult our intelligence by giving us these blatantly empty hospitals and expect us to swallow it.  That's just another factor in this really disappointing piece of garbage.",1111968000,5,901,4.748387096774193
