8317192,1,B001L4L9MW,I thought this was a waste of money. The quality is poor and boring. I got much more info from Vasant Lad's book Ayurvedic Home Remedies. I found it misleading in that it was going to show you how to make decotions and it does not. It is a woman giving a talk at a library that looks like her mother may have filmed it with her 1963 vintage VCR movie camera. As yoga teachers and Ayurvedic practicioners my husband and I were very disappointed!,1258934400,5,444,4.235294117647059
