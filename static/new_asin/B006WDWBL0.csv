8505581,4,B006WDWBL0,"The plot of the series is that Sherlock Holmes, who was thought to be dead, is brought back to life after spending years being preserved in honey, which never rots, because of the increase of crimes are related to the 19 century criminal mind, Moriarty. Holmes teams up with the young Inspector Beth Lestrade, and assisted by a cyborg, who is using a program based on Holmes' old sidekick, Dr. John Watson. The cyborg is a dead ringer for Watson's personality and by the second episode, with the help of the 22nd century science, takes Watson's appearance as well. At first Holmes believes that criminal is a copycat, as Moriarty is dead. Or is he? Holmes quickly learns that his old nemesis has been cloned. Now Holmes has a new mission - to capture the new Moriarty.

The premise is inspired of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, or should I say ripoff. Most of the episodes were based/inspired by the original stories and books written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I like the idea that Holmes stayed alive by being preserved in honey, but he was old when that happened, and now somehow he is a 25 year-old. It was a great idea to have Dr. John Watson as a Cyborg and for having Moriarty cloned. I was surprised the series was made thirteen years ago. Overall, I liked watching the series. I recommend it to both children and adults. This is a great way to introduce kids to the great Sherlock Holmes.",1337731200,,1399,4.5078740157480315
8505582,4,B006WDWBL0,This is a fine example of an interesting premise - return the greatest of detectives back to deal with the greatest villian he ever faced.  Now it may be a stretch to believe Moriarity could become a computer hacking genus but for the most part the attempts of the future society to deal with criminals was pretty well thought out and the characters proved interesting. I was sorry the serries ended so quickly.,1335139200,,411,4.63013698630137
