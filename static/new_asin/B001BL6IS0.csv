8283508,5,B001BL6IS0,"My wife and I have been playing golf for 1 1/2 years.  I am right around 100 now and she, hitting from the men's white tees, is clocking in in the low 100s.  We have had only two group golf lessons.  We've learned everything else by looking at instructional DVDs.

This DVD is the best darn golf instruction video that we have seen.  It is clear, the teachers know how to teach, and the results speak for themselves.

We both expect to consistently hit in the 90s by the summer . . . and this DVD will be one of the reasons.

Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1235260800,6,560,4.12962962962963
