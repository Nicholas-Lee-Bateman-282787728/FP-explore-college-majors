8161470,3,B000LC4CBK,I like Amy Bento in step aerobics but this work out was not for me.  Definitely would buy another of her step work outs but not another boot camp.,1352505600,,146,4.0344827586206895
8161471,5,B000LC4CBK,"I think this is a great interval workout. If you need/want to get a good interval workout in, so you have cardio and weights within one relatively challenging workout, this one is great. I'm not going to say it's the hardest workout I've ever done. If you want a true but kicking, go to a boot camp/cross training gym, like I went to before it closed. If you want a good workout you can follow in your living room, this one is for you. You can push yourself as hard as you want and increase the weight, so there is no reason you can't control the intensity of the workout to your level. If you're not into hi-lo dancey areobics or ZUMBA, this is perfect. If you like challenging choreography, you will want one of Amy's hi-lo workout or advanced step dvds.",1254528000,,756,4.330985915492958
8161472,1,B000LC4CBK,"I have Hi/Low extreme from her and it kicks my butt every time.  I was looking forward to this DVD.  I must say it was terrible.  Well, I should say, you can tell she was  younger and just starting out in this video.  I hardly broke a sweat to the end.  This is definitely a beginner workout and for those who have other tapes of hers you know there is nothing ""beginner"" about her recent dvd's.  Overall, did this workout  once and won't ever do it again.  Sorry I got it.",1247529600,,473,4.1098901098901095
8161473,5,B000LC4CBK,"I read where one reviewer stated that the boot camp workouts she has tried in the past were too man-oriented.  I've had the opposite problem.  I've tried many workouts that purported to be ""Boot Camp"" experiences, and were laughably simplistic and not at all a cardio or muscular challenge.  This one was both but not to a difficult extreme.  The cardio moves will leave you gasping by the end but not ready to crawl under the table, the bursts are just long enough.  The muscle moves are not complex but provide a great burn.  This is a really fun program for anyone and would be a great introduction to Amy Bento workouts for someone interested in sampling her products without jumping into the Xtreme workouts quite yet.",1226016000,5,723,4.653543307086614
8161474,5,B000LC4CBK,I love this workout.  The cardio is intense and the strenth and ab work just makes this a very well rounded workout.  I always feel it the next day which means it really works!,1221004800,,176,4.147058823529412
8161475,5,B000LC4CBK,"If you like the overall worked-out feeling, hit all your muscle groups and get your heart rate up in about an hour, this one is for you. Amy is friendly yet looks cool and fit which I find very inspiring. I feel so good after this workout, it's challenging but doable and wastes no time. Sometimes, workouts that are called Boot Camp are too 'manly', tough, or just too much work and no fun.  That's not the case with this one. I own all of her workouts and this one is at the top of the list.",1209513600,5,493,4.082474226804123
8161476,5,B000LC4CBK,"Amy does such a great job getting you into shape with this video.  Alternating high intensity moves with weights and abdominal work really gets the heart pumping.  The high intensity moves can be quite challenging, definitely for the advanced excerciser.",1207267200,3,254,5.325
8161477,5,B000LC4CBK,an amazing workout program...Amy Bento is tops in her field and great to look at. :) get it...you wont' be sorry!,1193616000,,113,4.428571428571429
