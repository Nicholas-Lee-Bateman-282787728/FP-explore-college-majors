1) looks exactly like a software demo from a guest lecturer, but is crafted to go really badly

2) the auditorium of college students isn't told that it's fake

That description doesn't give you the full picture though.  My favortie play is Glengarry Glen Ross, about the desperate office guys trying to sell real estate over the phone.  If you can picture what it would be like to do Glengarry Glen Ross in a real office filled with other employees and not tell those other employees that you are faking, that's what this is like.  Like the other reviewer said, that hoax part makes it like Borat and Bruno so if you like those you might also like this.  The writing here is better, IMO.  Don't get me wrong, the guy who does Borat is an amazing actor.  This is much more of a dramatic hoax.  Like a long bank heist, done for real.  I agree that nothing else is similar.  If the creator of GRRF ever reads this, dude, your puppet videos rock, keep doing more bizarre Dobo stuff.  People doing puppet videos these days either take them too seriously or make them annoyingly stupid.  You have got the gift of being both hilarious and serious with a puppet at the same time.",1245542400,,1426,4.426923076923077
