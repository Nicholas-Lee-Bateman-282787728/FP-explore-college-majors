1089273,5,6305828075,"Cameras were placed in the cockpit, under wheel wells, inside gun bays, behind armor plates, and between the pilots' legs to capture some of the best color footage of air combat and P-47 ground strike missions ever released to the public.  This documentary was made during the war and captures a lot of the flavor of the combat and the men that worked the machines.  You'll feel like you've gone back in time to join a P-47 Thunderbolt squadron during Operation Strangle, the conquest of Italy when Patton's push north stalled in the mountains of northern Italy.  Old Blood N Guts couldn't move forward because of terrain and the well-trained German army, so the Thunderbolts were sent in to bomb the bridges, railroads, truck convoys, and shipping to weaken the German war effort.  Great color footage of combat and life behind the lines.  I just wish it was longer!",989971200,2,867,4.791946308724833

1089624,4,6305828075,"Although this movie has fantasy elements in it, I accepted that from the beginning and enjoyed the movie for what it is: a beautifully filmed, fairly well acted movie with a number of familiar Japanese faces. The tengu are among the creepiest creatures I've encountered in film. The scenes, particularly the final seppuku scene with its bright sun and cherry blossoms, are spectacular. I thought it would be more fantasy-based and it wasn't, so I enjoyed the slant on the 47 ronin story, though I am more traditionally biased with respect to chambara.",1522281600,,551,4.935483870967742

In regard to this edition, the sound track is often misaligned with the action.  For example, the will pull a trigger and you won't here the gun shot for a second!  This actually ads to the humor at times.  It will be impossible to be pulled into the ill conceived story, however, there is still something to be enjoyed from noticing all the absurd choices they did make and the multitude of often misplaced special effects.",1513555200,,614,4.446428571428571

Well in a story about samurai honor we can make the samurai from the story kind of inept, and then bring in a white dude in this story that's important to Japanese history and make him far more competent than the samurai. Even without the source material this movie isn't very good, with its super insulting.  Here's an idea watch Ronin with Robert Dinero and Jean Reno.

The movie plays up the supernatural but the story of the honor. courage. commitment, and sacrifice is what is most important. Overall. this is a very entertaining and well directed movie. The lead role goes to Keanu Reeves, as ""Kai"", who was from the original story. The true hero of the story is the Samurai, Oishi. However, this is Hollywood's spin.

1090284,4,6305828075,"I have mixed feelings about recommending this movie...

This movie has been coming up in my personal recommendation lists for some time and the trailer looked good.

But... but when I finally bought it, I was surprised that is was not the movie that the trailer would lead you to believe.

It is beautifully shot and has a compelling story (a VERY liberal interpretation of ""Ako Incident"" from 18th century Japan), but the trailer makes it out to be something that it isn't.  It looks like a wild, sword and sorcery -type of  movie set in Japan, but nearly every supernatural scene or character in the entire movie is in the trailer... yes...  ALL of them.  Meaning: that it is maybe 10 percent ""cool effects and characters"" and 90 percent ""a standard samurai story"".  Which doesn't make it a bad movie as much as a ""bait and switch"" marketing ploy.

I still give it 4 stars though... it is a very well done movie and I'm sure most folks will like it, but DON'T expect it to be what the trailer (or even the movie poster) leads you to believe it is.

Go ahead and rent it first, because you may love it or end up scratching your head in confusion as the end credits roll... it is that kind of movie.

I hope this review was helpful for you, have a great day!",1505952000,3,1258,4.333333333333333

1090743,1,6305828075,"My son and I both agreed that this is one of the worst movies we've seen in recent memory.  They took a very moving story about loyalty, honor and justice at great personal cost, that is an actual Japanese historical event, and ruined it with weird monsters, witchcraft and bad CGI tree people.  The worst thing is that these odd elements they added to the story are not even remotely based on historical Japanese monsters.  For example (spoiler alert), the evil witch turns into a dragon during the climactic fight scene, and dragons are a Chinese thing, not a Japanese creation.  The tree people look like Voldemort and are an extremely strange plot twist - they appear to have no relation to the story, to Japanese history, or to - really - anything.  They pop up randomly for 10 minutes in the middle of the movie, as if someone at the studio had a ""great idea"" and wouldn't let the editor give it a mercy killing.  While they were accurate about the low status of half-castes in Japan, the whole plot line about the Daimyo's daughter falling for the half-caste is completely ridiculous if you know anything about Japanese history.  Fine ladies would not have been let out their chaperones' sights, much less out of the castle at night to go romance a low-class man, heart of gold or not.  Plus, they show her running through the woods in a kimono - if you'd ever tried to run anywhere in a real kimono, you'd realize that's laughable.  The only redeeming qualities of this movie are that it's pretty and captures the Japanese aesthetic decently, and that they actually used Japanese actors, instead of the usual mishmosh of Koreans and Chinese that Hollywood tries to pass off.  Plus, Keanu Reeves is actually half-Japanese, I believe, so there's some realism there.  But, really, don't waste your time on this tripe.  Put on your big boy pants and watch the original film in Japanese with subtitles - there is no comparison.",1492300800,,1930,4.677514792899408

1091127,2,6305828075,"This is to the writers and director, why did Keanu Reeves have to spend most of the movie being hated? Being called a halfbreed about a hundred times and beaten senseless or threatened with decapitation for every small offence must wear on a guy who can movie faster than a speeding bullet on command and swing a around a blade that deflects magical dragon fire. Also, if Keanu can give all of the ronin magical swords, who needs all of the planning, subterfuge, and self sacrifice? Oh yeah, because the film is loosely based on historical facts. But wait, if they have magical swords and a man who moves like he's in The Matrix, why don't they just take over all of medieval Japan?

Anyways, this film took too long to develop its cumbersome, hole filled plot and goes off on tangents and distractions that have nothing to do with samurai or bushido or the original story of the 47 ronin. And to top it off, Hollywood gave it a half-hearted Hollywood ending - I won't ruin the ending for anyone but suffice to say it made the movie more politically correct and acceptable to today's PG-13 audiences.

So, two stars for the special effects (seriously, a lightsaber Katana that deflects dragon fire) and the accurate recreation of medieval Japanese costumes and scenery. But otherwise everything else about this movie was terrible.

P.S. This is to the Hollywood writers: Samurai don't bow every five minutes to everyone they meet. Seriously, that bamboo armor is not made for kneeling. Please stop smoking whatever it is you are smoking and pick up a history book.",1484784000,,1564,4.721611721611722

I'm betting a lot of people will find it offensive because of the variations but I found it to be relevant if escapist, but also reverent. The ending is as honorable and hard to watch as the original tale's resulting act of honor, which is rare in such fantastic fare.

1091558,5,6305828075,"This must be the best film ever made that describes Japanese culture. It takes place during the medieval period of Japanese history, which officially lasted until 1867.  But Japan was psychologically in the medieval period until 1945, when Imperial Japan was defeated in World War II.  The film probably gives a much more accurate picture of the medieval period than more recent remakes as Japan was then much closer to this period.  It was made in two parts in 1941 and 1942 during World War II.

Physically the film takes you into an alien world where there is constant bowing, sitting on the floor for long periods and then suddenly getting up without any noticeable effort, and both men and women wearing robes which restrict free movement and make them take small steps.  Psychologically the film concentrates on the traits of loyalty and duty which were the foremost samurai duties of the medieval period.

The plot begins with a samurai lord attacking another samurai lord at a gathering at the Shogun's palace.  This is considered such a breach of protocol that the samurai was ordered to commit hara-kiri the next day. Everyone including the samurai accepts this as proper, except one official whose protestations are ignored.  With the samurai dead by suicide, his subordinate samurai are now classified as ronin, meaning samurai who no longer have a supporting master.

The ronin plan to demonstrate their loyalty to their lord by killing the lord who caused the attack.  But protocol demands that they first submit a petition to the Shogun asking that their lord be officially rehabilitated.  They expect a quick negative reply which would allow them to proceed with their plan but the response takes over a year.  The response eventually comes and the lack of a full pardon gives them moral authority to proceed with the attack.  Meanwhile other protocol complications create further delays.

Finally the time is right and the ronin attack and kill the lord.  They know this breach of decorum against the Shogun means hara-kiri for them and they willingly accept that.  But the lead ronin decides to wait for an official order.  The official order eventually comes and they are ordered to kill themselves.  The ronin readily accept this and the leader expresses great satisfaction that they have this opportunity to perform their duty under the samurai code instead of being hanged or beheaded. The final hara-kiri acts are performed in front of an audience where both sides are proud to participate in what is the epitome of the samurai code.

Meanwhile, a young woman had sneaked into the samurai area to see the ronin to whom she was engaged.  He had failed to show up for the wedding because he was involved in the attack.  She ends up killing herself to bring honor to their relationship.

This story of samurai loyalty to one's master and duty to the Shogun are undoubtedly exaggerated here to prepare the Japanese for their role in World War II.  Nevertheless, the Japanese do have a strong sense of duty as was demonstrated in World War II.  It has since been demonstrated in the modern post-war era where the Japanese with their discipline have made Japan an economic superpower despite their lack of natural resources.  This film thus gives a good account of Japanese culture even though the extreme sense of duty in the film no longer exists.",1474502400,,3366,4.883802816901408

He soon becomes the Samurais' greatest weapon against evil witches and enemies galore. However, there is something more to this Ronin. MUCH more than what anyone then knew; he was trained by a demon in both magic and martial arts! You get the idea. Rated PG-13 for violence and spooky imagery.",1458950400,,695,4.704918032786885

While the movie had a fantasy element, the core of the story was based on true events and is a truly remarkable story of courage and loyalty. The story was very well told, from beginning to end, although I will admit I wish it would have ended a little differently. If it had, though, it would have detracted from the beautiful story of loyalty, courage, and grace. There is an element of fantasy to the story that was beautifully handled and helped move the plot along without being unrealistic and it added to the over all plot line. The fighting sequences were beautifully choreographed and we're almost dance like in nature. It was apparent that the actors had trained extensively for their roles and all of their hard work paid off. It is a beautiful example of the richness and beauty found in other cultures and other times. When the movie ended I was left with a yearning to learn more about the 47 Ronin, and I'm so happy I took the time and effort to do the research. It is a remarkable story, and a beautifully made movie.",1452729600,8,1137,4.393364928909953

1093837,5,6305828075,"For most people they will either love this movie or hate it, depending on three things.  The first is the cinematography.  The movie creates grand vista of background and highly detailed and ornate scenes for the action to take place, like at the palace.  If you love movies where every scene could be a painting of its own, you'll love this movie.  The second is how well you know the legend and if you have seen previous versions of the story.  If you are a big fan of feudal Japan and the Samurai, you will not be disappointed.  There are many details, some as simple as how the Samurai sign their names to the pledge, which flesh out what the Samurai Code entailed.  This is not your typical Samurai movie with lengthy and massive sword fighting scenes.  The action is there, but kept to a reasonable and maybe minimal amount to make the point.  The third is whether or not you understand this is a redemption movie.  A lot of people I met who hated the movie went to it thinking it was a battle filled tale of revenge, and they clearly did not understand the ending.  If you see how the characters are paying in this life for their sins as away of redeeming their honor in the next life, you will love this movie.",1444348800,2,1218,4.345132743362832

1093843,4,6305828075,"Here is what you have to understand to enjoy this movie: it is not the Chushingura.

The Chushingura is one of the bedrock stories of Japan; a story of honor and obedience, of duty beyond death.  It is the story of retainers who valued their lord so highly that they waited to avenge him until their vengeance would no longer affect the lord's domain and its people, but who whetted their hate until they could serve their enemy the dish best served cold.  The 1962 film is a marvelous telling of *that* tale.

So what is 47 Ronin?  Well, it's what you might get if you played a game of D&D Oriental Adventures that had been *inspired* by the Chushingura.  The elements of the beloved lord who is forced to commit ritual suicide, the now-masterless warriors who bide their time to avenge him, and the vengeance itself are all still there... but so are ogres, Ki-rin, fox witches, and more magic than you can shake a stick at.

It's a fun and enjoyable movie... as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking it's something it isn't.",1443916800,,1035,4.473404255319149

1093977,3,6305828075,"I am really puzzled why this one got so much thrashing. Ok, nothing really new, and the story is set more in mythical China than historic Japan, but this is a straight forward fantasy action flick, and as such it actually works well enough. It's filmed well, and there is enough motivation for the action to happen. It even has a nice little twist. It definitely has nothing in common with a good old classic it is based off, and it will inevitably fail if compered to Kurosawa's masterpiece, so try to see it without the comparison, and as a light fair it is. You might find some enjoyment in beautiful sets, well choreographed action and a fantasy land it inhabits.
While Keanu is good here, he is definitely not of the right age for the character he plays, but then again, actors in their fifties are often paired with actresses in their twenties to thirties as love interests, and we are expected to believe they are of the same age.",1443225600,2,937,4.485380116959064

1094352,2,6305828075,"Unfortunately, this rating is not so much a critique of the feature (Which is decent for it's genre).  This is about the actual 3D Blu Ray disc itself.  This was the WORST programming I have encountered for a BDR .... ever.  It constantly wants to deploy BD-Live features that hang up my BD player (Panasonic machine - 3 years old). Even with the latest software, I cannot get the movie to play in my machine unless I turn off internet access.  Than I get this nagging screen which says, BD-Live cannot get access please enable internet access, 10 seconds of every minute while the movie plays.  This is just the kind of junk that Studios probably think is a good idea (and it's NOT),.... in this case it was executed extremely BADLY.  This is the kind of thing that would have someone would stop buying discs and buy online ... if it wasn't for the fact I cannot get the 3D version as streaming.  This disc is JUNK.

Other than that, the movie looks great otherwise.  The 3D spatially looks very nice.  I cannot tell if this is a conversion (probably is), but what is have seen is enjoyable.  What I can see behind the nagging internet access pop-op.  ridiculous.",1438560000,,1164,4.4904761904761905

This is a very quality production; the budget shows in its beauty. The landscapes, costumes, special effects and the choreography of the fight scenes are memorable. Keanu is probably the most truly swashbuckling that you'll see in any film of his--he fights and rides like a god and the scene where he escapes slavery to a Dutchman, all his fight scenes really, are absolutely exhilarating. And his acting is on point too, so there.

Now, did adding supernatural elements to a very traditional Japanese revenge tale add anything? I dunno. And, ultimately, of course, the real downer is the crappy ending, which they were not at liberty to change for American tastes.

If you are going for just Japanese ""The Loyal 47 Ronin"" tells the tale without the American/ fantasy spin on it. If you are looking for a more Hollywood version of the tale, watch The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings, for epic fantasy action; But if you are familiar with Japanese samurai and want a spectacular take on it, with great special effects and a decent acting job by Keanu Reeves, more of a LOTR style take on a classic Japanese tale, then this takes the cake. This was a masterful mix of action, CGI, brillant set pieces and costumes and great performances by the almost all Japanese cast. It was a great balance of east meets west, and reminds me more of a Chinese fantasy tale than anything I've seen from Japan. If you are a fan of Chinese/Japanese fantasy, with more of a Hollywood film, then I think you won't be disappointed. But hey I bought the DVD, so I have to defend that purchase, right?

This is supposedly,  a true story.  Tis about some samurai whose boss is honor bound to commit ritual suicide, cuz he(under the influence of a conniving witch) attacked a guest in his house, which is apparently a no-no!

Then, the samurai (47 of them) have to go into exile by order of the Head Shoganate, or something like that, and they end up wandering around the country until they decide that it's time for some PAYBACK!

Actually, I'm not doing justice to the film, cuz it's a little more complicated than what I mentioned.

BUT, it' a great movie about Japan, back in the day and I really enjoyed watching it.  The photography, the scenery, the actors and the story itself kept me interested all the way through.

It's in my video library, so I can watch it anytime. I watched it twice, so far!

1095223,4,6305828075,"It was a good movie, but there was one main issue that made it a four star instead of five.  It is a film that is based in Japan, or at least the lore is.  All of the actors, except for Keanu, are Asian, and the whole movie is in English.  The problem is that their accents make it seem like they are just reading the lines, but their accents seem to be getting in the way of keeping me in the movie.  The movie would have been better if it was in Japanese and they then dubbed it. Still has some good action.",1429488000,,509,3.8653846153846154

1095225,4,6305828075,"Interestingly done..............in the ""Special Features"" you hear that that most of the sets were truly physical with CG used only in the background. That alone gives it more of a Reality than many action films who rely heavily on computer generation to carry the films. It did not hold my attention as other films have but there was an under-current that kept me with it. It was the unity and continuity between the cast members. The costuming stood out to me as well..its ""crispness"" if you will. I own the film and will watch it again.",1429228800,,539,4.625

1095512,3,6305828075,"47 Ronin is an enjoyable movie but it has its flaws. I did like it but I thought it was going to be different and to be honest a bit better. Two things that really stuck out to me was the guy with the skull tattoo and the sorceress. The guy with the skull tattoo on his head is prominent on the cover and shown in the trailers. He had one or two lines and maybe 10 seconds of screen time in the whole movie. I think it was a waste of an interesting looking character. As for the sorceress, after she turns into a dragon, Keanu's character impales her forehead with his katana. There is no blood, no wound... nothing on either her dragon form or after she morphs back to human form. She just lays down and dies. It made the climax look like unfinished CGI, destroying the believability of the scene. Otherwise, I did get a few laughs from the moments of comedy in the movie and the drama and action was good.",1427155200,,907,4.159090909090909

1095912,5,6305828075,"I ran a feudal Japan newsletter for ten years and own quite a number of Japanese DVDs including several versions of the Chushingura (47 Ronin) story. I was very hesitant to watch this version, worried that it would have become Hollywoodized with everyone riding happily off into the sunset. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they created a watchable, interesting, modern take on the classic tale.

Sure, they added in witches and demons, along with a half-breed. That's all right. Romeo and Juliet got moved into New York City while maintaining the essence of the story. I'm all for reinterpreting stories so that modern audiences can relate to it. If this is a version that resonates with a new group of people, that's fine.

There are all sorts of things addressed here. The way the Japanese society viewed outsiders. The various levels of caste. Notions of honor and bravery. What one does for love. You might agree or disagree with whether some of these things are ""right"" - but the idea here is that we have a window into a specific culture. We're viewing how people acted within that society's confines.

The dialogue got a bit campy at times, and some scenes seemed clear imitations of scenes from Lord of the Rings and, heck, Pirates of the Caribbean. Still, the overall effect was well done. I'm all for any movie which brings the beauty and stately grace of some of those Japanese classics to the modern big screen.

Well done.",1425254400,,1443,4.7370517928286855

1095917,5,6305828075,"I was quite amazed 47 Ronin was a good a movie as it turned out.  My first thought was that it might have been a movie in Japanese with subtitles.  A foreign language movie with subtitles is hard enough to follow trying to read the words and watch the movie.  Dumb me, I probably could have found out much earlier that it was an English speaking movie.

The acting was quite good.  I found that Reeves, oft times an actor of the same type of delivery, played a very good part and didn't speak in his ""Matrix"" voice.  The rest of the cast, and there were many I recognized from a variety of other movies, were well cast and did a fine job.  Not knowing the background story, I cannot say how close to the author's story this was.  I can only say, I enjoy the movie immensely.",1425081600,,774,4.1824324324324325

I have lived and worked in Japan, and I collect Japanese movies with a specific interest in the jidaigeki genre.

I'm also a big fan of Keanu Reeves, heck I usually even enjoy his ""stinkers"", (ie ""Johnny Mnemonic"").

So when I read the reviews of this movie I just could not believe that this movie could be that bad.

It's not, unfortunately, it's WORSE.

I'll start with the absurd premiss that any ""half breed""/gaijin could ever even be part the 47 Ronin? That basic premiss, if you know anything about the Japanese, is simply unbelievable. I could not suspend my disbelief of this basic thematic fact. In fact I felt almost as insulted by this absurd premiss as I'm sure the Japanese are at the idea.

Second, imo the production design is worse than AWFUL. It seems to be a  mix of whatever hollyweird gaijins  think of as ""Asian"" designs and motifs used in very sloppy un-Japanese ways. The costumes and sets were not anywhere near authentic Japanese and even their uses were wrong, (i.e. Warriors of rank in full armor standing around as mere guards). It's so bad that it is insulting to the Japanese, (or anybody else for that matter), who cherishes the Chushingura.

The Japanese are NOT some random mix of ""asian"" influences. They are JAPANESE and EVERY detail of EVERY aspect of their lives at that time were specifically done in JAPANESE detail. EVERY detail of life was important and mattered to them.

This is like taking some cherished American story and putting all of the actors into kilts. That would be  stupid, inaccurate and disrespectful.

That reminds me of another total failure, unlike the actual people and places in the real Chushingura the production design had absolutely zero attention to details. Even the so called ""formal"" rites and formations were loose and sloppy.

The characters also acted in completely un Japanese ways with almost zero formality between each other.

Then there were the absurd caricatures of the so called Dutch on ""Dutch island"".

All in all I consider this film a lazy disrespectful insult of the Japanese and of their most cherished tale.

OK so given it's a work of fiction, and even excusing all of the stupidity and laziness of the production design can we call this a decent/good fiction?

IMO, NO.

In fact I consider this to be the worst movie Keanu Reeves has ever been in, and I admit that even as a fan of his work in general that's really saying something.

I had to try three times before I could watch it all the way through.

Knowing this movie as I do now, in retrospect, I would not waste my time on this  movie even if was free.",1421971200,8,2631,4.651515151515151

The movie is based on the story of the real 47 Ronin who put justice and loyalty to their lord

In my opinion, the Western mind-set is unable to grasp the culture of Japan, or for that matter
any of the Eastern Nations [China, Korea, etc]. The culture of Japan, then, not sure about now,
is discipline one, with respect for elders and family values (which most Western countries; albeit, the USA
do not have or have lost).

While in Japan he got a taste for Samurai movies and I grew up watching Hiroshi Inagaki's spectacular movie Chushingura and the samurai trilogy (the story of Miyamoto Musashi). So I didn't rush out to see this version of the tale of the 47 Ronin. Casting Keanu Reeves seemed questionable. And really, why was a westerner in the story at all?

This version of the 47 Ronin is much better than I expected. Sure there are some strange plot twists, with magic, demon beasts and Tengu (Japanese demons). But the sets are fantastic. Great care was taken in creating the armor and the buildings. The cinematography is excellent. So I found it easy to pass over the excesses of the US remake.  The movie would have been better if they had left Keanu Reeves out of the movie and stuck with an Asian cast.

A bias portrayed may be only a way to indicate an enemy, an adversary, a danger in a more cultured polite (diplomatic) way.
Whether it is ultimately PC (politically correct) or not depends entirely on your point of view of course.
It does give rise to hugely entertaining stories, paintings, movies.
Artists have made fortunes catering to all the mythologies (yes that includes religions).
So, this movie is very beautiful at times. Including the beasties.
The story is an old legend as you probably know. A few tweaks wink at our biases (however old) such as adding a ""half breed"" and calling him demon. Subtle, but only slightly.
The fighting is very good as is the CGI. CGI has matured now. When done well it is impossible to justify the negative aspects of huge sets or trucking big casts around the world. So much pollution creating activities are really mostly unnecessary anymore. That's a huge plus for the planet.
The Bluray video quality was as it should be, not like a knock off.
The extra features were pretty good at times also. ""Meeting"" the real 7'7"" guy who has to learn some martial arts such as kendo is fun. It also reminds me that Bruce Lees' favorite weapon was not a katana, shuriken, etc. It was a .357 Magnum.

1097226,3,6305828075,"Most times I go to see a flick and I want to like it, so I might let it slide on some of its weaker points just to increase my enjoyment. Then there those films where I have no emotional investment so I can remain objective. 47 Ronin is one of those films.

Here's the scoop. Kai (Keanu Reeves) is found, as a young man, nearly dead in the woods. He is a half breed and some suspect he might be a demon. The shogun of the local town takes him in and raises him. He's never considered equal to those around him, but his skills come into play when another shogun makes a witch assisted power grab for Kai's town.

This is a very middle-of-the-road endeavor. The writing offers few surprises, even in the dialogue. I don't like it when I can guess the next words out of a particular character's mouth. The directing is the same. Given the scope of the story this needed much greater visual impact. This was as plain as paper. The fight scenes were well choreographed for the most part and the effects were okay. Reeves does a decent enough job I suppose. He's not the greatest actor and he has only a few lines here. Much of what he does here needs to be expressed physically. I liked Rinko Kikuchi pretty much in ""Pacific Rim"" and she was okay here. I just needed a bit more from her. Many of the other main actors present I have seen in other films. All do a decent enough job.

As I mentioned, this is just okay. It needed more on every front though. With a reported budget of $175,000,000.00 it seems the producers should have chosen a director with more history than Carl Rinsch. He only had 3 short films under his belt prior to this. A better director would have beat up the writer for some better lines and the actors for some better portrayals.

This doesn't hurt to watch but I wouldn't put it at the top of my 'to see' list either.",1419811200,,1839,4.2457142857142856

It's just super disappointing that someone along the way didn't stop this train wreck and say ""this could be such a cool movie if only we didn't do it this way"".

1097626,2,6305828075,"Though the movie ""47 Ronin"" is set to release in the US on Christmas Day, the film has already been playing in Japanese theaters for the past week. Despite numerous well-known Japanese actors and actresses in the cast list, the movie has underperformed in the Japanese box office. In retrospect, the film's lukewarm reception comes of little surprise; after all, the tale of the 47 Ronin, known as Ch'shingura, is one of the most well-known historical tales in Japan. There are countless adaptations that feature a more accurate and respectful portrayal of the original story than what the American film version offers.

The most obvious change is the inclusion of Keanu Reeves's character, the half-Japanese and half-British outcast Kai who serves as the film's protagonist. The decision to cast a white actor as the lead in a decidedly Japanese story ostensibly has financial motives: the American entertainment industry has long been reluctant to cast Asian actors in starring roles, fearing that American audiences would be unwilling to watch a movie or television show with a lead character who isn't white. However, decisions such as these might carry more insidious implications.

Movies such as ""47 Ronin"" and 2003's ""Last Samurai"" play into the fantasy of white people assimilating and being accepted into a foreign culture while still being viewed as ""special"" within that culture, someone who stands head and shoulders above all the rest. Case in point, Tom Cruise's character in ""Last Samurai"" did not simply narrate the story; he was the most central and most impressive character within that story. In many instances, he was depicted as being a better samurai than most of the samurai themselves. Put bluntly, movies such as these express the continued desire for white people to lead people of color, but not in a way that is overtly hostile or imperialistic.

Thus it is clear why ""47 Ronin"" did not resonate with Japanese audiences. Despite the source material and supporting cast, it is ultimately a movie made for white people. It is yet another story in which a white character is depicted as superior to people of color, and regardless of the intentions of the filmmakers, movies such as these are wholly exploitative and disrespectful to the cultures they are trying to portray.

 How would others feel if stories from Northern and Eastern Europe had asian and africans constantly cast as the main protagonist in each movie which portrays events from the ancient history of their lands? That is how absurd this is.",1418601600,,2536,5.057416267942584
1097627,4,6305828075,"A superb fantasy reimagining of an epic tale of duty, honor, racism and revenge.

No. It is not on the level of ""The Kings Speech"", ""Pride and Prejudice"" (2005),  ""42"", ""Michael Clayton"" ""Conspiracy (HBO)"", ""The Proposition"", ""Tristan & Isolde"", ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" (2002) or ""Kingdom Of Heaven (Director's Cut)"" which I consider to be examples of perfect modern movies. Is ""47 Ronin"" well made with a great story, competent direction, excellent sets, a superb caste, a perfect soundtrack, exhilarating action sequences and exemplary special effects? Absolutely! Was the original screenplay mercilessly edited so that a potentially fantastic story is severely diminished? Unquestionably! Despite its shortcomings 47 Ronin is a richly entertaining and almost satisfying cinematic experience! This is a very good bitter sweet fantasy drama that could have been much much better if it hadn't been butchered in the editing studio!
Recently I read the Joan D Vinge novelization of the original screenplay by Chris Morgan and Hossin Amini. What a revelation! The theatrical release is a shadow of what it could have been. Boo to the decision makers that butchered the original screenplay in favor of what was released theatrically!

1097635,5,6305828075,"I absolutely loved this film.  What a fine visual mythological Samurai epic, and action adventure masterpiece.

  The special effects are right up there with the Hobbit, and Star Wars, as are the very detailed costume and set design pieces. The martial arts sword adventure elements are also quite equal with other classics like ""Enter the Ninja"", ""Conan the Barbarian"", & ""The Highlander"".

 Keanu Reeves is cast, in my opinion, very well in this role playing the non-Asian outcast in an ancient Japanese society.  His back story is very much a mystery through out the film, even when we find out he was trained by the mythological creatures who first trained the first Ninja warriors.  This is NOT a copy of Tom Cruise's earlier film, that was more of an historical US Civil War era Japanese Samurai adventure about real historical events.  This story takes the real history and adds in, just like 300 & 300 Rise of an Empire, some artistically added fantasy mythological creatures. The film does not suffer from the addition of the fantasy elements.

 The Samurai outcasts (the 47 Ronin) work well as a brotherhood of heroes out to avenge the wrongful death of their grandmaster at the hands of an evil warlord.

  One disappointment was the lack of combat time given to the giant silver Samurai fighter, but in total this movie does not disappoint. A +  & two thumbs up for this one, too bad modern Hollywood critics and American audiences alike did not give this film the respect it deserved.",1417996800,,1497,4.79296875

It seems to me that the style of this movie was almost that of Chinese or Korean culture. To make matters worse, the story of this movie was not about samurais with samurai spirit but about specters or monsters.

The basic premise of the story of the 47 Ronin is there, just fleshed out & elaborated on. The movie piqued my curiosity about Samurai warriors & their code of Bushido & Seppuku. Quite enlightening.

Why they chose to add an American, and one that can't even act is beyond me. 'Can't Act' Reeves' character makes absolutely no sense in a movie that takes place in a time when any contact with westerners had never even occurred.

This version of a classic film sacrificed story for CG graphics and jumping from action scene to action scene. Like a big, dumb comic book for young kids and teenagers. It sacrifices historical facts for a silly fairy tell that we tell little children around a camp fire to scare them. Gone is the beauty of samurai movies that bring to the mind questions about what the Japanese became during the 'age of peace,' and the loss of their humanity in the process. Those movies make us question our own selves and our own morality. This film makes you forget everything. Perhaps that's why some like it I don't know. All I can say is that for my part, as an aficionado of Japanese cinema, and especially samurai movies, I wished I hadn't bothered to have wasted my time watching it. Order at your own risk.

1098656,3,6305828075,"I know this story from when I lived in Japan and learned martial arts since 1968. The story is very serious and describes how Master less Samurai are classified as ""Ronin"" and usually transfer over to another master or DIE with their own. Since it is such a great loss, the background is not explained very well to people not raised in the Japanese culture. Ritual suicide is done as an ""Honor"" when it is accepted as an option in certain circumstances.
The Shogun in this movie was regarded as a very uncaring, unfeeling,vicious and cruel ruler.
The Shogun could have accepted the Ronin(47) into his own ranks, but wasted these brave men's lives. Instead, he treated them as prisoners of war. Times were demanding and the Samurai had ultimate power as they were the only ""enforcers"" of the ruling Shogun. I highly recommend seeing the movie ""Shogun"" by James Clavell to get a better background of the culture.
The Love story was not well explained and left too much room for assumptions. Very sad...
Even Keaneau Reeves is an excellent actor, but this part is was still not developed well and even disappeared at some point for some reason and reappeared. No continuity.
I think this movie left too many unanswered questions even to a martial artist or a Japanese raised in Japan.",1412899200,,1281,4.723214285714286

But still, looking at the Blu-Ray cover art. . .it's featuring some skeleton-painted dude who's in the movie for 30 seconds, and says one line. Why are they featuring this nearly insignificant character in trailers, posters, and cover-art? There is some grown up emotion and even depth of character here, but they seemed to be marketing it to 17 year old boys.

1099043,3,6305828075,"The pacing of this good looking fantasy epic and its humorless approach are why this movie gets docked a star.  The trailers purposely played off a feel for ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" type of movie which whet our appetite for another fun, cheeky action adventure flick but ""47 Ronin"" keeps its dour tongue firmly set straight in mouth as it holds to a Japanese background complete with a particular Japanese ethos of austerity coming out of their past feudal structures and elevation of honor and class positions within society, though to this historical backdrop the film adds a lot of fantasy and mysticism to doll up the adventure.  So any humor we were expecting isn't there and that's disappointment number 1.

Disappointment number 2 is a minor quibble, though it affects the feeling for the film.  The pacing is slow, trekking carefully and deliberately up to a final showdown where the outcome is never truly in doubt.  Because of the slow pacing the adventure feels less than rousing.

So you'd think that by my review so far I don't like this movie.  Not true.  I know this is one of those movies that I had a certain expectation going into it and it wasn't met.  I'll watch this again sometime, knowing what to expect, and I'll very likely have a very different experience of the movie (probably come back here and give it 4 stars).  After all this movie has many elements that I like: Japanese feudal society; samurai; big dudes in scary suits of armor; a pony tailed Keanu Reeves; monsters; actor Hiroyuki Sanada; the lovely (and freaky-eyed) Rinko Kikuchi (Mako Mori in Pacific Rim); good special effects; exotic locales; swordcraft; and the distinctly Japanese sensibilities of honor/ shame as character motivations and class restrictions.  So there are a lot of things to recommend this movie.  I'd just caution the potential viewer to check their expectations at the door prior to watching.",1411257600,,1911,4.864197530864198

As in cooking it doesnt work and in film it doesnt either. Keanu should have been canned for  a rougher scrappier guy, like Russell Crowe or  a younger version of him.  Also the fact that killing onse self as an act of ""honor"" is celebrated in movies but we have laws in 48 states that prohibit the elderly and  very sick from doing the same without prosecution! Has society gone insane!  You mean we can accept today, right now, that  a husband and father of 3 children comes back from battle and because of whatever minor transgressiion he did or maybe just losing the battle for his shogun/Lord, he must now do the honerable thing and kill himself? And we don't vomit at the millions of wives, children and parents whose lives have been swept under the rug by this ONE act of lunacy in a supposedly sane society? We freak out when 2 groups of teenagers kill eaqch other over gang turf in East LA.......and cant believe how law enforcement tolerates it or is at best ineffective to stop it, but that this was actually  a way of life in much of Japan for centuries doesnt freak people out. Yuh think the widowed wife in those times  didn't starve along with he children, and if taken in by the husbands family, they were probably worked to death and treated like dirt as is usually the case in these things. Especially if most of the children are girls.

I think the ending was horrible and there was no point to it at all. Either all should have lived or none should have lived. (not  a  spoiler, don't worry. lol)  The fact that in the ending these men were still so subservient to the honor code  made me really think how many Japanese women over the centuries lost husbands for absolutely nothing.  And as well....why don't we make movies about the Lords who run the ronin and samurai? Those are the men I'd want to be  friends with.

1099333,3,6305828075,"This is a film made for 3D effects. Those effects are more important than anything else in the film. This particular product has the film in normal Blu-ray Disc for those who are not equipped or for those who do not care for the 3D effects because they obliterate your critical vision.

That is just the point. The film as for its content is very limited. In the Samurai times of Japan two rival local rulers get into some kind of strife because the younger ruler uses the services of a witch to reach his target and that target is to get the older ruler from next door eliminated and his daughter bound to marry him. At the same time the Samurais of the older ruler are banned and forbidden to take revenge.

A half-breed, Kai, half European, half Japanese, rejected by all, has been trained by some special and sort of supernatural Buddhist order and as such has developed some super power, essentially extreme speed in reactions and unexpected attack from the side negotiating the direct central attack.

The banned Samurais get him out of his slavery as a prize fighter on some ship in some harbor to provide them with his special powers and his contact with his original order to get weapons. Thats how they end up 47 Samurais against the younger ruler on the day when he is going to be married to the daughter of the older ruler.

The rest is only special effects and the end is banal.

The supreme ruler of Japan imposes the normal end to the disobedient Samurais: death by their own hands, seppuku or ritual disembowelment (dont worry you only see the shoulders of the Samurais: no bowels are visible: note that kind of death is a slow death). Only one is saved: the son of the leading Samurai. An ending showing the honor code of these Samurais who are eliminated though they only asked for justice and since it was not given to them they just took justice in their own hands and worked it out by themselves. When a system reaches such a point of absurdity it is bound to end very badly. And it did in 1945.

The story of the 47 Ronin, based on true events has been written about and made into numerous movies. I watch lots of Japanese movies, have read several Japanese based novels, fiction and non-fiction and yes I've been to Japan and loved it. This fantasy version tells the basic historical thread of events but clothed in a mythic and magical setting. Often Ninja are seen this way, as being able fly or even walk on water. The action is well done and beautifully shot. The art, costumes and sets are wonderful.

1099889,3,6305828075,"47 Ronin is based on a true tale about samurai who went  to insane lengths to exact their revenge when their daimyo was disgraced. Masterless, they pretended they were drunkards and craftsmen, all in a bid to avenge their masters honor.  When the plan did go into effect, all but one of the samurai died, judged too young by the Emperor to commit seppuku. 47 Ronin is very, very, very loosely based on the original tale, and features far more monsters, magic, Zombie Boys, and Keanu Reeves than the original source material.

The shame of it all is that the original 47 Ronin tale is an engaging story of fatalistic honor without any embellishment.  But this is Hollywood after all, who associates Keanu with all things Asian  in the same way Tom Cruise somehow ended up being The Last Samurai, Reeves is thrust into Japanese folklore.  The scriptwriters at least worked hard to make him fit with the cultural aspects of a mythical Japan  he was trained by the Tengu, the long-nosed bird people who supposedly taught martial arts in the mountains.  Folklorists have sometimes associated Tengu with Westerners who may have settled in the mountains in Japan, so it makes as much sense as any other explanation that Reeves character hails from there.

The story hews loosely to the original tale, except that the bad guy has a witch at his disposal (who is actually a shapeshifter), and supernatural foes abound: animated suits of armor, the aforementioned tengu swordsmen, and of course oriental dragons. You get the sense that this film was meant to be an Asian version of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and at least when it comes to special effects it succeeds.

But its not a film about Keanu Reeves.  American audiences aren't likely to be happy with what amounts to an ancient Japanese form of suicide-by-cop, in which our collective 47 ronin willingly go to their deaths by flouting authority with the sole purpose of avenging their masters honor. This is a beautiful film, but its not an upbeat one.

Also, Zombie Boy speaks a handful of words and appears for less than 30 seconds in the movie. His inclusion is cynical marketing at its finest, which is perhaps part of why audiences punished 47 Ronin so severely.  Its a film marketed all wrong trying too hard to gloss over a strong story at its core.  Wrong audience, wrong approach, but still a visually engaging film.",1407456000,,2367,4.741463414634146

Fight choreography is so-so but you'd probably be better served watching Ip Man for better fight sequences with heavy handed historical drama thrown in the mix or even Red Cliff, and for fantastical martial arts go check out House of Flying Daggers or Good Bad and the Weird.

1100173,3,6305828075,"Big budget ($170 million) and dropped on Christmas Day along with other blockbusters and cerebral potential Oscar nominees.  Pretty brave for Universal and various affiliates.  But yet this IS a big picture in terms of story and scope.  Keep in mind that I'm reviewing this film having no knowledge of the real events or even of the earlier film versions.  I've not read any books about this group of leaderless Samurai nor am I familiar with any anime, comic books or video games that may be associated with the story.  I am familiar with Keanu Reeves and several of the Asian actors that play key roles however.

Reeves plays Kai called ""half-breed"" by most of his adopted clan.  He is the byproduct of an English sailor and a low level Japanese woman.  Abandon at an early age in the forest, he was taken in by some magical inhabitants until he decides to see the outside world as a young teen.  He will eventually return to his original adaptive parents in order to secure swords with mystical powers.  Kai finds the outside world is difficult but is eventually adopted by yet another family, led by Lord Asano (Min Tanaka).  The rest of Asano's followers aren't too happy to incorporate Kai into their ranks.  Other than Asano's beautiful daughter Mika (Ko Shibasaki) who takes a shine to the hunky half-breed.

When Asano is visited by the Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), along with his second in command, Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano), potential romance between Kai and Mika becomes unlikely.  Kira has his eyes on Mica too.  Kira, an evil-doer, has a witch (Rinko Kikuchi) working for him.  She casts a spell on Lord Asano which temporarily clouds his mind (and his eyes) which causes him to make a half-hearted attempt on Kira's life.

Asano is sentenced to death but is given the option of seppuku, an honorable way to die on the condition that Mica will marry Kira after a one-year morning period.  Kira now in charge of the village, places Asano's second in command, Oishi (Hiroyki Sanada), in a deep hole for the year and banishes the other leaderless Samurai, now known as Ronin.  Upon his release, Oishi finds Kai who had been sold to slavers and together they reassemble the other Ronin to take back their honor and that of Asano.

While the film looks majestic in many respects, it tends to bog down much too often.  The romance between Kai and Mica is essentially non-existent except for longing goo-goo eyes.  The film seems to play like a soap opera at times.  Some of the fantasy scenes are very cool.  I would have liked to have seen more.  I would have preferred a Japanese language dialog rather than English as well.  Some of the actors clearly struggled with English.  So much so that I almost turned on subtitles just to understand what they were saying.  This is a film with a terrific story, some good actors and a huge budget.  Yet it disappoints in many ways.

The Blu ray disc on the other hand is near perfect.  The video is in 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  For the most part the film is beautifully shot and it shows up well on Blu ray.  Beautiful earthy tones, along with accurate colors and excellent black levels.  Grain levels are consistent and well preserved.  Even better is the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  Once I got the volume settings right that is.  I was struggling early on to hear some of the dialog, what with Reeves low level mumbles and the Japanese actor's English struggles.  I had to crank my amp up higher than normal by several clicks.  This can cause problems later on in action sequences when the amp senses too much surge and shuts down briefly.  But this never happened, even with some of the high frequency sword fighting.  The surrounds are active much of the time and the LFE channel kept the subs hopping.  Terrific sound.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Extras include some deleted scenes, a brief featurette, Reeves and director Carl Rinsch talk about the character Kai, a sword training piece and some info on the development of the mythical creatures in the film.",1407110400,2,4093,4.69620253164557

I love this genre and let me start by saying I think poor Mr. Reeves is a much better actor than he gets credit for.  I think many of us from the ""Bill & Ted"" generation just can't stop seeing him as ""Ted"".  I've seen him in a few independent films where he really surprised me by how much he's seemed to mature as an actor.  That being said, I really enjoyed watching this version.  I try not to take my movies too seriously and enjoy them for their entertainment value.  This movie has nice imagery and effects.

I understand one very small part of the blasting and that is the typical wooden performance of Keanu Reeves, but we expect that of him so no big surprise...he does what needs to be done for this film.

What a beautiful move, visually stunning! The costumes and the settings are breathtaking. The fight scenes are terrific and the performances of all  others concerned is moving and stunning. it is fictionalized but hauntingly beautiful.

Might also be that a lot of seams might have ended up on the cutting room floor. If so I apologize because I have enjoyed Keanu in the past. The director seam to have been more interested to stick in as many special effects as he could instead of focusing on developing the characters. This should have been a character driven story not action and CGI.

1100855,3,6305828075,"Historical inaccuracy are common in Hollywood. I personally view the ones in 47 Ronin to be no more reprehensible then the ones committed in superheroes films. Yes, I am comparing changes made to characters from Batman, X-Men, Spiderman and Iron Man's cannon to this historical tale of the 47 Ronin. Deal with it, they're just stories after all. We really have no way to know it there really wasn't a half breed character, do we? After all, history is told by the winners, and often inaccurately.

With a 2 hour run time, it did feel a bit slow to start, setting the stage for the second and third act. Once it gets going tho, it moved rather nicely. I didn't find myself checking my watch every 10 minutes wondering when it would end like another holiday release I won't mention. If the trailer interests you then you could probably do worst at the box office this holiday season. I enjoyed it, but that's just my opinion. I give it as a 3/5",1405728000,,942,4.476744186046512

The concept is less intricate but the pacing, the colors and the rituals are akin if not identical. The most riveting event in this film is the mass suicide by 47 Samurai warriors who lost their social standing when their Lord committed regicide. Kurosawa films adapted the European classics with aplomb and set a trend in ''The Outrage""...the American version of three interpretations by three witnesses of the event: the rapist, the victim and the husband of the victim. Kurosawa is quintessential Japanese tradition, which is no longer prevalent today...a lost art. Ronin [a UK- European concoction] and 47 Ronin are the last two i have seen so far.

3D looks good.

It's not as slow as a lot of people suggested, and I don't get the hate on the Tengu. They don't look like the modern incarnation with a huge nose, but they actually do fit the way they were described in the more ancient myths about them.

Rinko has fun with her role and it's interesting to see her playing a villain.

This is worth a rental. Don't expect a happy movie, but it's like a B-movie samurai film with better special effects and an out of place white guy in the lead.

1101282,2,6305828075,"This film quietly sneaked into the theaters, and quickly and quietly was kicked out when it debuted on the 25th of last December. '47 Ronin' bombed so badly it was laughable. I think it made more money here than in its own native country, where it also flopped. The film was rejected from everywhere. Not to mention its massive amount of production trouble which resulted in three release date shifts, the film finally was released after a tally of a whole year later after the film's original set release date (November 2012). As well as the budget growing higher and higher and fights over the cut of the film between the studio and director. This was a disaster making 150 million on a budget of 225 million. Most people hated the film, and I have to agree. My review of '47 Ronin'.

 '47 Ronin' is the tale of the 47 Ronin, who after watching their master kill himself honorably due to a spell being cast on himself, decide to take revenge on the man that did it. Among them is the master's second in command, Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) a man sentenced to a year by Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) in a pit to break his spirit, just in case he may want to seek revenge on his master's unjust execution. A year later he teams up with Kai (Keanu Reeves) a half breed, who was disgraced among the other samurais. Together the two along with the 45 other discharged samurais, seek revenge of Lord Kira, and to rescue the princess, Mika (Kou Shibasaki) who after her father's death, was forced to marry Lord Kira.

You don't even know how hard it was for me to explain the story. I typed, and then retyped this thing 4 times, before settling on this one. Honestly, when you actually watch the film, it's a pretty by the numbers samurai tale. Just with mystical beasts, and witches, and cyclops...

I'm not kidding when I tell you his one was filled to the brim with every possible visual effect you could imagine. It was god-awful. The first scene we watch with Keanu Reeves involves him and other samurais hunting down some gigantic, poorly animated CGI dog beast thing. I can't even describe it, as i9 had no clue what the hell it was at all. I go in thinking I'm going to see a samurai film, and I get a CGI dog thingy??? What the heck, that's what I thought.

Not to mention the lackluster scripting which was over stuffed with characters and drawn out action sequences, oh and walking. Lots and lots of walking. The script could have been condensed into a light 90 minute popcorn flick, but instead we get this overlong, surprisingly dull flick that ticks in at about120 minutes. It didn't feel like 2 hours, it felt like 3. The scripting scimp's on characters to instead include a scene with a witch who turns into a dragon... The script didn't know what to do with itself. I mean, nobody stands out here at all. Keanu Reeves character is in about 15 minutes of the film, and is almost just as one dimensional as it gets. The witch is your stereotypical, freaky, goth girl with no style or substance given to her. I'm not even going to start on you with that dialogue. Just the most out right cringe worthy thing ever. I mean, when going for realistic you don't want to sound like a bunch of characters off of some old soap opera. When the words come out of the actor's mouth I just can't help but think 'What the hell? Did he seriously just say that?'.

The editing is beyond bad. The film's editing is what kept the film from its original November 2012 release date with struggles over who gets the editing rights, the director or the studio and in the end, the film becomes lost between the fight. The editing cuts back in forth between fight scene, CGI galore, random close-up of Keanu Reeves just so you know he's there, and a few stupid pieces of dialogue about destiny and redemption thrown in for good measure.

I'm not going to lie; I did find the production values quiet pleasant. The film was good to look at; I'm not going to lie. The scenery was beyond gorgeous, and the costumes were well designed. Japan was well represented in set designs and wardrobe. The film looked so lavish and pleasing to the eye.

The actors gave it their all. 'Keanu Reeves' had surprisingly little screen time despite being billed the lead (Of course, it's Hollywood) and I couldn't call him more than a supporting character in spite of a few random un-necessary scene's made to try to make him a lead, even if his character wasn't. But in the few pieces of him that I actually found appropriate in the film, he did well. The Japanese native actors were pretty decent. Some of the actors spoke English with ease, while others not-so much and it didn't help that what they were saying was so badly written. 'Hiroyuki Sanada' whom played the real lead character, was outstandingly convincing in his role as an arrogant, yet loyal and brave leader of the Ronin. He slipped into his role with ease. Other highlights include Min Tanaka as Lord Asana the master, who was bewitched and later sentenced to death 40 minutes into the film. He was very good, and made for the role.

All and all '47 Ronin' is a poorly scripted, shamefully edited, dull, CGI stuffed samurai film who's production values and well assembled cast are left betrayed by a lack of any character development. D 5/7/14

'47 Ronin' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence, some disturbing images and thematic elements. It's appropriate for 14 and up.",1404691200,,5421,4.52808988764045

There are two perfectly good movies in here, but they don't go historical enough or fantasy-ish enough for any of it to work right. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. Does this hinder my enjoyment of the film? No.

The performances are decent enough and the effects work ranges from very good to passable. The story itself is mostly enjoyable if a bit slow and inconsistent.

From opening frame to closing credits I was spellbound. The writing, cinematography, music and acting were all excellent. Of course Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves. If you absolutely hate his ""acting"" you're probably not going to like this film.

I came to it not knowing anything about the legend, story, or myth. I just wanted to be entertained. And I certainly was. Obviously a movie like this is pure fantasy and if not made in a way that allows the viewer to suspend their disbelief, it will be an epic failure. Well, it allowed me to suspend my disbelief through the entire film, and the excellent use of 3D contributed to that immensely.",1404691200,,790,4.5174825174825175

PLUS!

Keanu seems to have gone to a voice coach and gotten rid of the whole surfer dude thing.  I think he did really well for the material given.

Basic concept, Ancient Japan, treachery, someone's master gets killed, these guys have no master anymore (thus they are ronin), and though ordered to not seek revenge, they do a bang up job of attempting just that.

Keanu is a sort of outcast adopted son of sorts and gets involved in the shenanigans.

You have spooky mystical guys in the woods, magical weapons, tons of locales that are pretty disparate yet very detailed and well done.  Excellent mystical fight scenes (martial arts fight scenes, not so much).

The story....  Based on a ""true"" story from Japanese history, and from what I hear they are true to that.  Which is really where this thing falls down.

To me, the ending on this thing really blows and is why it got my rating.

I would suggest if you're going to watch it, enjoy, then turn it off before you see the last 10 minutes or so.

Spoilers

Really bad spoilers, don't read further if you don't like big reveals.

They all swear that after they are done with the whole vengeance thing they are going to commit ritual suicide for not following the Emperor's orders.

You're left hoping for something better, but nope, they all sit on mats and do themselves in.

The other thing here, is Keanu, lord love him does very well, but comes across as fairly European / detached from the culture, and yet he totally buys into the whole suicide pact thing even though he's found his one ""true love"".

So, it fails (to me, personal opinion), on a lot of levels.",1404604800,,1840,4.541033434650456

Contrary to what critics had to say, I thought the movie was pretty good.  It was nice to watch, visually.  The story moved along crisply.  The action scenes were good.  Critics thought the dialogue was stilted, the CGI was intrusive, Keanu Reeves was flat, and the story was a downer.  I would say this, the story is not a downer, but it's not an American superhero movie in which Superman saves Lois Lane at the end.  It's concerned with concepts of fidelity and honor, and the ending does a good job of celebrating these virtues, albeit not in a manner realistically fitting to modern life. Its dialogue and story line are much better than what you'll get from Thor, Iron Man, etc.  The CGI contributes to an ethereal milieu that provides a suitable context for this type of story (and, frankly, I don't understand why anyone would select this movie as the place to begin voicing CGI criticisms).  I would expect that people will enjoy it more than they would most of the Superhero/Legend/Fairy tale movies that are being cranked out these days.  It has more substance and a lot fewer empty calories.  Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves.  Not that he lacks range, because he's at least as dynamic as most robots not named C3PO or R2D2.  But I had no problem with him in this movie.  I understand the criticism, but I think it's a hangover from the last two Matrix movies, and the House on the Lake, and, come to think of it, pretty much every other movie he has made.  In this movie, and in this role, it actually works to his benefit.  If you're looking for an entertaining legend/epic/action movie with fewer empty calories, you won't regret renting or buying this one.  I liked the Last Spiderman movie.  Didn't like the last Thor movie.  Was 50/50 on the last Superman movie.  Fell asleep during the last Hunger Games movie. I liked this movie.

1102012,3,6305828075,"Review: 47 Ronin (2013)

47 Ronin might be the last nail in the coffin of the career of Keanu Reeves.  In some ways the films box office failure is not fair because the movie itself, although not great, certainly has its serviceable moments (certainly worse films have been box office smashes).  The filmmakers were banking on the idea that Asian audiences would flock to this picturewhich didn't happen.  Part of the problem is that apparently the guys with expensive suits and fancy degrees couldn't anticipate that foreign audiences wouldnt respond to seeing Keanu Reeves in a Hollywood version of a sacred cultural story.

From the beginning, 47 Ronin doesnt play things exactly straight.  There is a scene early on where Reeves kills this mythical dragon beast thing (I don't know what it is or what its supposed to be).  There are also some cool battles with wizards and some extremely fast moving warrior-monk types.  It is during these scenes that I believe my ignorance (or perhaps I should say cursory awareness) of the true 47 Ronin tale saved me from becoming furious at the film.  Obviously this is a story with some inherent power since it has been handed down for centuries...why some idiot thought that fundamental core should be de-emphasized in favor of CGI pseudo-mythical beasts is...well, its why everybody is always terrorized when Hollywood announces they're going to do a screen treatment of some important tale.

47 Ronin is a tale about honor, but Im going to be honest and say its a type of honor I don't understand [Spoilers coming].  Its the story of a group of rogue Samurai who want to avenge their masters death only for the privilege ofget thiscommitting honorable suicide at the end of the film.  Thats their prize.  I contend that most Westerners do not understand this, and that many of the ones that say they do understand aren't being entirely truthful.  I, for example, can give lip service to the Samurai code, but its just words to me.  My heart does not soar at the end of the film as the brave 47 Ronin prepare to take their own lives in a beautiful ceremony of death.  My fundamental thinking at the very core of my being lines up more with Robert De Niros character in Ronin, who, when hes told about the sacrifice of the 47 Ronin, says simply, they chose wrong.

Please feel free to try to explain this cultural disconnect to mealthough I hesitate to believe a few paragraphs can bridge the substantial gap.  Also, despite the fact that Westerners apparently answered a questionnaire in which they checked yes next to do you want to see an Americanized 47 Ronin film? the true responsejudging from the box office receipts of the moviewas that they did not.

If the filmmakers of 47 Ronin wanted to make an interesting Samurai film that appeals to both the East and the West starring a mixed-race protagonist, they should have done a screen adaptation of Gonji by T.C. Rypel.  Then they would have been free to add all the CGI flourishes that they wanted to without risking offending an entire culture (in the same line of thought, Peter Jackson should be making Drizzt DoUrden films instead inserting elves where they don't belong in The Hobbit).

I don't hate this film, I found it entertaining.  My biggest fear is that the incompetent idiots responsible for the grand miscalculations that doomed 47 Ronin from the start will come to the incorrect conclusion that Samurai movies are not viable.  I like Samurai movies, I want to see more Samurai movies.  Heck, Ill even go see some more films with Keanu Reeves.  But if you want to make a goofy adventure flick, don't try to say you're doing a treatment of a culturally significant story.  There are plenty of good books out there for adaptation that don't come prepackaged with impossible-to-achieve cultural expectations.

This movie has beautiful scenery and great special effects. Keanu Reeves acting is always good regardless of what character he plays.
47 Ronin could have been a great movie comparable to Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai"" if it was not for its witchcraft and detour from historical facts. It is a movie worth its price tag for a person who is looking to forget stress and daily frustrations by watching somebody else's imagination depicted in a movie.
That being said, 47 Ronin fails to capture the taste of the true Samurai movie. It does not have all of the facts related to those warriors who sacrificed their lives for a cause they believed in. It these warriors were alive now days, they would probably want to commit seppuku again after watching this twisted version of their history. I give this movie 3 stars. I would have giving it five if it was not for the witchcraft it depicted which I am not sure existed (if it did) in that country's period.",1400976000,,1022,4.5

He's a half and half, who's Dad had serious drug issues, and there went the family ties. Does being half make him Japanese? No, it doesn't. What's with all the special effects and Hollywood garbage, anyway? The biggest mistake made was making into an American movie for the brain dead ""sheeple"" to be further programmed by, and I think it is a complete dishonor to the historical value of the story of 47 brave men-sans Keanu stinking Reeves, that were willing to risk their lives to restore honor to their master, who was set up to humiliate himself by this jerk, forced to commit seppuku, at a time when Bushido still ruled. How does Reeves even fit into this equation? Like ""hang ten dude!"", let's smoke one before we decide to raid the castle, and do it up righteously."" He, alone made me not take it seriously. I guess I am a stiff, traditionalist when it comes to these type of movies, and I hate to see someone's Magnum Opus (Watanabe) turned to a C flick by  1) having hollyweird reproduce it with their Illuminati brainwashing symbols, and 2) putting some American assctor as the main character in this very dignified, and heroic story. To me, ""Toshiro Mifune Junior"" should have kept it really real.

As a westerner (American), the concept of seppuku is extremely foreign: westerners will bravely fight the enemy to the end even in the face of overwhelming odds, but will most likely not even consider committing suicide in honor and in obedience to their shogun. It was very interesting to try and put myself in the place of the samurai. In the end, as a westerner trying to comprehend the Japanese system of honor and obedience, I am awed, impressed, and saddened. I feel a very deep respect and admiration for the Japanese samurai, and a great sadness for the people who loved them.",1400544000,2,664,4.782608695652174
1102280,4,6305828075,"I remember when this movie was released that I wanted to see it. For whatever reason, I did not get a chance to. So when it became available to rent, I jumped on it. I personally think that Keanu Reeves is one of those actors that is underappreciated (is that a word?) but usually gives a decent performance. I was not disappointed. His portrayal of the half-breed Kai was great. He always seems to immerse himself into the role, the character, and the storyline.  And no matter what Reeves stars in, you find yourself empathizing or sympathizing with him. He is usually the underdog, the champion, and the quiet hero.  And his role in ""47 Ronin"" is no exception.  Kai (Reeves) is the mistreated and neglected half-breed (a half demon) who has found love, and in a sense salvation with the ruler's daughter, he hopes to one day find freedom and respect.  The only thing standing in his way is a very ambitious ruler, who will stop at nothing to get power including aligning himself with a witch/demon and betraying those close to him. While the greedy ruler takes steps to take over the throne, those determined to right a wrong are prepared to make the supreme sacrifice. And the only thing that can stop this pervasive evil is the steadfast determination of 47 honorable samauri who are willing to lay down their lives for what is right (Hiroyuki Sanada (of Helix), does a wonderful job portraying the Samurai leader).

In conclusion, 47 Ronin was entertaining and exciting to watch. While not perfect, it was a delight to the senses. The cinematography (not too dark but not too bright either), costumes (seemed authentic) and special effects were eye catching, and the plot decent. Basically, this film offered everything that you would want in a sci fi/action adventure film that included a touch of the martial arts and mysticism. It was a decent story of love, demons, redemption, betrayal, sacrifice and vengeance. And while the ending was bitter sweet, it was honest and fitting. I enjoyed 47 Ronin and would recommend it.

I know he can't act and needs special effects to cover that up but come on. I can see why many people say it's a movie to watch once. Its long and boring. Even the effects are not anything special. In my belief, if they would have kept the original story and not added the new charter for Reeves the movie would have done better than it did in the box office and have had staying power for multiple viewings.

 1. I have read the book 47 Ronin, visited the gravesite several times in Minato-ku, and my main hobby is Japanese culture.
 2. Hiroyuki Sanada is one of my favorite actors working today.
 3. Keanu Reeves, well, no.

When I heard a few years ago that Reeves was going to make this a movie, failure was my first thought.  I kept reading about delays, then no news, then more delays.  A premier date was finally set and I told a couple of my friends to keep that date open.  I also warned them it was going to suck.  When the date arrived, it didn't even show anywhere in my area.  Another bad sign.

Fast forward to a release date on 3D Blu-ray and I placed my order.  I have to say that its not the greatest movie by a longshot, but I didn't think it was horrible be any means. It looks very good in 3D and that is its strongest point.  Not stunning, but good.

Some of the acting is a little flat.  Its always hard to watch Japanese actors who are not native English speakers tackle the language difference.  Sanada-san does well but it seemed a little stretched for the other cast members, some of whom are big stars in Japan.

My big fear was that the much loved in Japan story of the 47 Ronin was going to get butchered right to the bone.  This is a fantasy movie and I was surprised that they were able to apply the main points of the story to the movie.  Of course there is the required for a movie love story, but surprisingly it doesn't get in the way of what this movie is about.

Its not the best but I think if you like fantasy movies its worth giving it a watch.  I'd give 2  stars instead of 3 but that option isn't available.  Watch it in Blu-ray if at all possible, 3D really makes it better.",1400284800,4,1746,4.115727002967359

Trying to get accepted by the other locals proves to be a challenge for Kai because of his outsider status.  However, he is eventually unintentionally thrust into a role requiring his fighting abilities after his adopted father dies. There is much more to this movie than what I wrote.  It is listed that the character of Kai was written into 47 Ronin. However, the end of the movie implies that 47 Ronin is partly inspired by real life events that took place. I say partly because obviously many of the events portrayed in the film such as: supernatural/fantasy elements centered around a magical shape shifting witch(played by Rinko KiKuchi) (contained in the film) obviously did not take place.",1400025600,,834,4.744827586206896

1102464,2,6305828075,"The tale of the 47 Ronin is one of the most famous legends in Japanese culture, but this retelling does it a real disservice on several levels. First and foremost, the most egregious failing is also it's most unavoidable: casting a white, English-speaking protagonist to lead an otherwise all-Japanese cast. We all know why this is done, and it's awful, but let's not dwell on that right now. Keanu Reeves, while not being a great actor, would be totally fine in this kind of film, if his character weren't simply slapped on top of the existing story almost as an afterthought. He really plays no vital role in the tale of the samurai, and every element of his story could be removed without changing the trajectory of the plot. This does not make for a compelling or engaging main character.

Not coincidentally, all of the supernatural elements added revolve around Reeves, and also feel like they exist in a vacuum. This doesn't feel like a magical world, and the characters don't behave like it is either. However, when they randomly encounter a mythical beast, cave filled with demon monks, or giant dragon, they act like it's no big deal. It's all very disjointed. The film would have been better served completely overhauling the original legend and going for full fledged fantasy, or staying far truer to the source material than they did. This muddled middle of the road approach fails two masters at the same time, creating a filmic ronin all its own.

All this being said, the film is nowhere near as bad as most large scale action films these days, there's just so many wasted opportunities that you'll spend more time thinking about what could have been than what exists on the screen before you.",1399852800,5,1709,4.750841750841751

I was entertained for my two hours and didn't even notice when the popcorn ran out. I liked the dark scenery and contrasted colors, some of the shots were beautifully done and the storyline, although not exact to the true story, was very engaging. It's an adaptation (not an exact depiction) of a famous story, the movie even puts up this information at the end. This isn't that unusual, and I really didn't care. If I wanted to watch history I wouldn't be watching a movie made for entertainment.
The acting was good except for the token fat funny guy-I guess he needed to be highly discernible in order to generate some interest and emotional investment in his character and his two jokes weren't bad but they felt unnecessary-as was the need to display his lack of definition in his abs. I was rooting for the bad guy to lose and was appropriately not happy with the ending (trying not to give any spoilers.)
My biggest complaint would be that some of the editing could have improved the movie significantly. Some parts could have been extended-like the fight with Kai's master and others omitted-like the horrible cgi beast and spider. One obvious dose of cgi with the witch could have held the movie and maybe allowed them to make that fight scene with her better. Otherwise this movie did it's job. Well done, count me entertained.

1. No Japanese language in either verbal dialogue or in subtitles, but lots of Western languages were offered. I guess the producers forgot about historical accuracy per  the subject matter and location.
2. All the characters were very Westernized in their behavior.
3. Cheap CGI of the beast appearing in the beginning of the film. Anatomically as incorrect as a movie made beast can be. All the spider like eyes were laughable as well as the pair of drop down horns. Hollywood imagination gone wild (must have spent too many hours doodling in science classes and not paying attention).
4. The only other CGI of a flowing robe becoming a person or snake was artful but became tiresomely cutesy & redundant after being shown excessively over and over.
5. Clothes, props and sets were Hollywood cheap; very synthetic plastic/polyester looking.
6. Not up to the grandeur of Asian film with immense numbers of cast and authentic period pieces - very low budget.
7. Emotions also were more Westernized such as the overly emphasized - jealousy. The producers, director and script writers must have been banking on American/European audiences to pay the bills thus the Western emphasis.
8. Acting was robotic; especially the Reeves character with the constant stiff bowing and weak emulation of old TV samurai style shows.
9. So cheap was this film that they didn't even budget in either prosthetics or CGI of Seppuku acts by our characters. The emotional highlight of the story.
10. It was rated as one of the top box office bombs - ever. I see why. Another reason to be wary of the honesty & motives of five star reviewers.

1102546,3,6305828075,"But somewhat lacking on ""Plot"".  (Pesky adults tend to like a small dose of ""plot"" with their movies...  Especially in a movie that is supposed to be based on history...?)

Keanu (aka Neo in ""Matrix"") Reeves does OK, but there is not much believable dialogue or character development.  Basically, he is an outsider allowed to serve the local group of Samurai - who in turn serve the local feudal lord.  Keanu turns out to be a Bad-A and can fight, kick, jump, and slay large wild critters better than the real Samurai.  Some Samurai are resentful and hate him for this.

Along the way, the local Samurai are banned from their homeland, scatter to the local villages, and hide.  Then they are reunited (under Keanu) and come back to kick out the bad guys.

Definitely overshadowed by either ""Samurai lore "" or ""Hollywood Plot Gaps"".

Not a chick flick.  Nohow, no way...

1102550,5,6305828075,"I've read a few of the negative reviews, and it definitely seems to me that those reviewers understand neither the intent nor the genre of this version.  Just as with Kara Dalkey's ""Genpei,"" or the Japanese films ""Gojoe"" and ""Ashura,"" this remake of the historic epic brings a mythical quality to the tale, moving it into the realm of fantasy and making no attempt to adhere rigidly to the factual details.  When versions like this one are made, it is assumed that the viewers will already be familiar with previous renditions, and be capable of appreciating a remake that is nuanced very differently.

Unfortunately, film-makers sometimes forget that there are movie-going fundamentalists who are fully prepared to take offense at the least deviation from their expectations.  Thus we see other reviewers trashing the film for not being a carbon-copy clone of previous versions, or for introducing the element of ""the white savior"" ~ a ridiculous complaint, as the protagonist's abilities are due to his having been trained as an outcaste youth by tengu, the famous mountain warrior demons of Japanese lore; his being an illegitimate half-breed is the reason for his rejection and has nothing to do with his abilities.

Those who allow such trifles to spoil their enjoyment of the beautiful cinematography and CGI effects are unfortunate indeed, as this film gives its Japanese cousins an excellent run for their money.  If one is willing to overlook the fact that Keanu Reeves has only one acting style that he brings to ""Ronin"" just as he did to ""Matrix,"" ""Little Buddha,"" etc., it might be difficult to find any real (as opposed to imagined) fault with this offering.

(though alittle more complicated, this error is analogous to making homemade chicken soup and omitting the salt.)]

Kai (Keanu Reeves) is a mixed race outcast child found by a high ranking gentleman in the woods and kindly taken in to be fed and live on the outskirts of society. loved by the official's only child Kai, though disrespected by society, seems generally okay with the status quo as he loves the child, later young woman, and is content to be near her. he is also appreciative and grateful to the kindly official for allowing him to live amongst them. he earns his keep by serving the official and the official's samurai as a first class tracker and actively and modestly works to be of use to them, for which the official graciously thanks him, though the official's samurai treat him distainfully, apparently because he is of mixed race and apparently because the part of the forest in which he is found is rumored to be controlled by demons and when he is initially found he has markings on his head which they say are marks of a demon. to us the marks appear to be healed wounds someone has inflicted on the child. Kai, though clearly intelligent, initially displays almost no supernatural abilities (he smells that something is wrong with the beast but it is unclear whether he knows this because he knows how the animal is supposed to smell from previous tracking, or he knows this because of magic - as he smells a leaf and then makes his statement, his comment is vague enough that we can attribute it to his tracking expertise). as a preeminent tracker he is able to slay the monstrous beast single-handedly. he achieves this feat through bravery and a willingness to risk his life for the villagers but though successful, credit for this accomplishment is given to another.

He experiences a lot of really nasty racism (almost getting murdered by a samurai as a reward for saving the samurai's life) and is frequently contemptuously called half breed by the other characters (which humorously and inappropriately kept bringing to mind Cher's old song of the same name).

an ambitious competitor comes to visit bringing his witch and basically kills the kindly official and takes his daughter and lands.  the official's samurai vow revenge, though they are ordered not to by an even higher official (shogun). ignoring the shogun they kill the interloper and are punished with death.

story's main strengths: Kai is a very sympathetic character. he is uncomplaining even when treated poorly. He's able to remain stoic because of the decency of the official and the kindness and love of the official's daughter, Mika. these three characters are the heart of the story and are well written, but it is not really believable that an outcast who has been accepted by the dominant male and female in a group would continue to be so poorly treated by the official's employees, the samurai.

human nature i.e., a desire and need to please their master who they are financially dependent upon, would have had the samurai treat Kai with at least surface politeness because he is accepted by the most wealthy and successful official in the province. the samurai's mistreatment would've been an insult to their lord, and I just don't see them behaving this way, given their position in life. a very rough modern analogy would be office workers in a small company: say all the secretaries who, for whatever reason, dislike one of the female office clerks. the female company owner who works in the office daily however likes the clerk and shows this by thanking her for her work ethic. do you really think the secretaries would ostrisize, harass and abuse the clerk, knowing the owner likes her? no, they would not, especially in a small firm where group harassment and abuse would be known by all. a secretary or two might try sneaky and snide attacks, but all the secretaries working en mass would not do so because they would fear the consequences, i.e., possible job loss.

an audience may not think of this specific comparison, but they would know intuitively that something is off about this group harassment dynamic, given the dominant male's (who is essentially their ruler on the local level) acceptance of Kai. a fact not fully appreciated by most filmmakers is that audiences are experts on human behavior having interacted with other humans since birth. filmmakers therefore are pitching their stories to Ph. D.'s in human behavior (not human nature though: audiences generally do not know human nature, as we're a species who, in my opinion, are still, unfortunately, largely ignorant of ourselves. but we are experts in recognizing human behavior within a framework, be it fictitious or otherwise). an audience can easily differentiate between authentic and fake behavior and simply will not respond positively to nonsensical human interactions in a story. they may not know what's wrong specifically, but they will know something is false. instead of recommending a film to friends/family they'll say ""it's okay"" or ""worth a watch but I wouldn't buy it,"" when the filmmakers want them to say ""worth standing in line for,"" or ""loved it, buy immediately.""

story's main weakness: villains aren't impressive enough and need to do more damage to more characters; they are greedy, ambitious, spiteful and cruel, rather than evil. and they are dumb: what evil villain worth her/his salt would throw the lead samurai into a hole for nearly a year, only to let him out right before the forced marriage of the murdered official's daughter. of course the ex-samurai is going to gather his forces for revenge and rescue. dumb villains are not scary. even little kids just being exposed to fairy tales know that. difficult then to fear a villain who fails Villainy 101, no matter how impressive the visuals.

also the following is unbelievable: a man is imprisoned in a dank hole for a year, barely surviving, is freed and can hardly walk, is incoherent and confused when found by his son and wife in the street. yet after one modest meal, exchanging a hug with his loving wife, and instructing his son, he's off on a rescue mission. this character is not magical and so his sudden recovery is not believable. a scene or two of him getting his strength back, perhaps his wife nursing him, maybe a little light exercise before hopping on a horse for what looks like miles long galloping across open countryside, would've made his physical abilities believable. I know he got out of prison a week before the official's daughter was to be married and so time was of the essence, but the way the writer/filmmakers wrote/filmed/edited his physical abilities, so soon after his weakened imprisoned state, does not work. in a sequence or so later, with no physical rehabilitation or strength conditioning, he's in a fight for his life with the Keanu Reeves character, who he's trying to rescue, and in the fight he acquits himself too well for a man who's been nearly starved for a year and who has been without exercise. story needs some work here.

the main villain I suppose is Kira, but he spends too much of the film smirking (literally, this is what he does in his character's introduction into the story, which was not a good call by the filmmakers). he also indulges his taste for cruelty to those of lower rank than himself, which makes him a bully, rather than evil. he seems weak and spoiled, rather than frightening. his witch is his secret weapon, and though she has her witch skill set, she is spiteful rather than frightening. neither is impressive enough individually or together to inspire alarm. also, by having them go after this one official, the storyteller doesn't make them big enough, their interests are too narrow: they are focused on this one official, his daughter and property, and are not a threat to the larger society or country. the filmmakers don't understand the role of the villain. villains need to be a metastasizing cancer, in my opinion. in this story the villains are pre-cancerous: the twosome are a nasty piece of work for sure but little more than opportunistic bullies with a touch of black magic provided by the witch.

an effective villain is much more than a mere bully. an effective villain is, and must be shown to be in the story, willing to do whatever it takes to get their way. their value system is totally skewed: they do not consider the lives of anyone other than themselves to be of any consequence if those lives restrict them from attaining their goals. and they must be intelligent. their entire crew needn't be smart, but the mastermind(s) must be bright; it is a requirement, as a dumb villain is not scary. had the filmmakers/writers understood villainy the lead samurai would've been killed rather than thrown in a hole; the entire village would've been razed to the ground, and that would've been only the beginning. villains don't play nice and they don't care. they are rabid dogs (who on the outside look normal) and the job of the writer is to demonstrate their utter ruthlessness and narcissism, thereby giving the hero/heroine work to do by destroying them. these villains are villain-lites therefore the story is weakened.

Too many fantasy elements and extraneous storylines were added (romantic involvement between the ""half-breed"" Kai and Mika Asano, the proverbial dragon lady, and the demon monks) which detract from a tale of sacrifice, honor and duty.

On Technical & Visuals of this film: I saw this movie in theaters in 3D and in 2D. This movie was stunning to watch, & the soundtrack stood out and is hard to get out of your heart/mind. I think I will have to get the soundtrack cd too. I loved the beauty of where it was filmed, the sets, the digital recreations of the countryside, the costumes, makeup. It is very apparent to me that the people that were in this film, put a lot of effort into it, and really tried to respect the culture, but also wanted to make it open to be shared with the world, in this fantastical version of the story of the 47 Ronin. I just want to not that if you are looking for an exact recreation of the true accounts of the 47 Ronin, then this is not what you will see, because it was not intended to do this. The Director and the wonderful Japanese cast wanted to bring this version so they could bring some of the beauty of the culture to the world, and respect the original story by not claiming to imply that this was exactly the way it happened.

FIRST OFF I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT BIG PROPS TO THE JAPANESE CAST TO HAVE TO SAY THEIR LINES IN ENGLISH a language that they are not fluent in. Although I think they did a great job, under the circumstances.....I think they should have done it in Japanese with English subtitles.  NOTE They did film it both in Japanese and English, but this disc set does not have it in spoken Japanese. So I have to be honest that I also bought the Japanese Bluray to watch it in spoken Japanese, too. But that is just my preference. I still enjoy it in English, too.
On the Stars of the movie - In the order of who plays in it and their importance in the film:
Hiroyuki Sanada is the main focus on the film and does an excellent job at playing Oishi. He really has a way to show emotion in his facial expressions, and his voice too, is very expressive. He shows both his soft side, anger, toughness. His fighting skills are exceptional. His years of training from when he was a young man have paid off, and was a valued resource in the making of the film, including spending time with Keanu Reeves to perfect his sword (Kantana) moves. They have since gained a friendship and respect for what Keanu has done in working so hard on it.
Keanu Reeves - plays Kai - I have to start with, Keanu was very impressive with this sword skills and fighting scenes. If you don't appreciate it, you have never taken classes on how difficult it is to use a katana. I have and it hurts like heck to get good at it.
Keanu Reeves plays a very humble, reserved, who was taken in by Lord Asano to live in his land, after he fled from Demon monks who raised him from infancy, and taught him some ways to use special powers /fighting skills, after he was abandoned by his English sailor father & left there by Japanese mother (or so he was told by the Demon monk leader). Although many critic say Keanu showed no emotion, I feel that it fit his roll. Keanu played Kai like he did to show his respect for Asano and his samurai, as well as for his forbidden love, princess Mika (played by the gorgeous singer/actress Ko Shibasaki) . I would have loved to see more of Kai & Princess Mika being more romantic with each other but I know that that would not make sense with respecting the fact that they could not ever be together, because if status issues. It is just the romantic in me that would love that. Part of me would have loved if the ""deleted scenes"" were not cut. I think they would have been better if they weren't cut.
Tatanobu Asano - Lord Kira - Pure power hungry evil evil man...OMG! He also did a great job in making you hate him. Great actor, makes you believe him. Awesome! He is also really great in fighting scenes as well as the scenes he is in. Interactions with the witch, the way he torments the princess & confrontation with Oishi were really good.
Rinko Kikuchi - She looked so awesome as the evil, heartless sexy witch. Excellent job IMO. Made it easy to be creepy, & hate her as well. She is crucial to this movie. I loved her in past films she has been in and a great addition to this wonder Japanese cast members.
Jin Akanishi -played Chikara (son of Oishi) - He is a popular singer in Japan, but I really loved his acting skills. He is very attractive young man with many fans in his music and acting career. I think I would love to see more of his films, now. Jin was great in his scenes and did well in both action and emotional ones.
Ko Shibasaki - the beautiful Princess Mika that is in love with Kai but knows they are never to be together in this lifetime-  I enjoyed her portrayal of her. I wish they did not cut he deleted scenes, either. They could have at least kept the one with Lord Kira an the child playing shamise (Japanese guitar). Some criticized her for not being more powerful but I saw the character as being strong. She kept strong to all the terrible things done against those she cared for, and fought back when she could.
Min Tanaka - Lord Asano (leader of Ako) I thought he played this part very well.
I could go on about more of the cast but these stuck out in my mind as affecting me.",1399075200,,6082,4.203767123287672
1102859,2,6305828075,"Our hero, sort of a cross between Conan and Samurai Jack, takes his friends on a fanciful adventure through countryside that looks more Chinese than Japanese, and after much hollering and screaming and swordplay, kills a computer-generated monster and gets the girl. The local chieftain promptly spoils an otherwise promising conflict resolution by ordering everybody to kill themselves.

I have seen movies wrap with lousy endings that fizzle and frustrate, but this is the only one that does it by wiping everybody out and leaving a creepy little control freak in charge. Reviewers rationalise it as a depiction of historical values. We're supposed to appreciate blind obedience?

I imagine a sequel where the hero survives somehow to return and kick the little chieftain's posterior.",1399075200,2,786,5.330645161290323

I love on amazon how when you scroll over each star it says 1-i hate it, 2-i don't like it, 3-it's ok, 4-i like it, and 5 I love it. THis film was a little bit better than ok. I liked it. It still had that sense of Japanese quality of beauty, honor and respect that we all love from foreign films along with action, love, intrigue, the mystic sense of the spiritual/sci fi world, as well as the usual sword play and hero vs bad guys. The movie had good flow, decent dialogue, good acting, nice special effects and ok action scenes. I felt it was missing that extra umph that would have made it a blockbuster. I also feel maybe Keanu wasn't the best choice for kai. In Hollywood I feel like they are getting worse with casting and better with special effects. Maybe it would have worked better with someone who actually is a skilled in swordplay. All in all not a  bad choice to kill some late nights with movie picks. Should you pay? I wouldn't wait for it to come out on hbo or get it on redbox. Thanks Godbless

And, while some of the effects, filming, etc are ""new"" in style, the story stays true to the basic principles of honor, budo, and the original story.

Suggestion:
Don't let the flash trailers deter you from watching this as more of a modern remake of a classic (with a few different spins on the tale if you've seen any of the Japanese versions).",1398988800,,512,4.565217391304348
1102862,3,6305828075,"47 Ronin tells the fictional tale of a band of samurai set out to avenge the death and dishonor of their master at the hands of a ruthless shogun.

Having not really watched the previews of the movie, I kind of expected something a bit different and maybe more true to the real tale of the 47 Ronin.  Not that the movie is bad as it does have a decent fantasy tale that has demons and witches along with ancient samurai battling it out but truly not enough of it.  It also seems that there are some things missing in the story as if left on the cutting room floor and unfortunately parts of the story that seem to drag along and keeps going on and on.  For me, the ending was a prime example of that, you think it is the last scene and nope, there is another and another and another and detracted from the movie a bit.  Reeves channels his inner Matrix as unfortunately it seems that's the only character type he can play with the monotone voice lack of emotion type character.  I liked Reeves in Matrix and even Constantine to a lesser extent, but he can't seem to do any other way of acting.

One thing I will give credit to the movie though, the scenery was beautiful and the sets and effects well done.  It was actually of the things that kept me watching.

1102973,3,6305828075,"I've been waiting 2 *years*  for this movie...almost three years, actually. When Sanada Hiroyuki was cast as Oishi Kuranosuke, I had great hopes. I was excited and very pleased to hear that a big Hollywood production company would actually embrace one of the most inspiring (foreign) tales in human history; a story about the terrible cost of justice, brought about by honor, character, and loyalty; with determination, perseverance and suffering- not even considering the deaths of the 47 ronin ([46, actually] and historically, at least two of their mothers and other acquaintances).

I'm very traditional and ""old-fashioned"". I've been to Sengaku-ji several times; I know the extreme reverence that Japanese society has for these ronin. I know enough about the actual story to know where the director's ""theatrical license"" warped and muddied the Japanese behavior, character, and story line in his effort to make the story more universally appealing. I was appalled to hear that the story of ""The 47 Ronin"" was going to involve ghosts, spirits and specters. And Keanu Reeves (or any other ""white"" [American]. Not that I have anything against whites or Americans; but this tale, if portrayed accurately, only involves a pure Japanese society [in its' own time- 1701 to 1703]).

I've also been a huge Sanada fan, back to his teenage years in the JAC. I liked Keanu Reeves all the way back to his ""whooaa"" in 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'. So I decided to grit my teeth and watched this movie. It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. I was lucky to understand before I viewed it that it was going to be a Hollywood fantasy. I really had no expectations--I didn't know how H'wood would incorporate the 47 ronin into a 'ghost story', but I knew going in beforehand, that H'wood had yet again disparaged and vilified another hallowed foreign sanctuary.

For all it's faults- and there are lots of other reviewers who'll detail what they see as poor script, story, and acting qualities- this movie holds one singular appeal for me. I've seen the 'ugly American(s)' conduct themselves in Japan (in my presence, and sometimes, ignorant of my observation). Even in the majority of the 5-star reviews, there's an almost universal self-congratulatory condescension (that the writers unknowingly author) praising the film for it's connection to historical relevance- when it's obvious that most of the reviewers' knowledge of the Ako vendetta is at the very best, superficial, and in many cases, only linked through each writer's ""authoritative"" knowledge by chanbara movies and video games.

This movie is an abomination; the mistitle, ""47 Ronin"", is as badly misleading as McDonald Hamburger's claim is, that their offerings approximate nutritious ground-beef ""burgers"", et. al.

However, if the movie is watched for entertainment only, it's passable- and as the movie 'Copying Beethoven' might have made people curious about Beethoven's works- this movie might encourage the viewer to be curious enough to do some research on the actual historical event, ""Chushingura"" (a Japanese word used to describe all written, acted, and filmed portrayals surrounding the Ako Vendetta).

If you're interested in the 47 ronin as treated in film, there are three versions that are roundly praised as better movies- ""Chushingura [1962]"" by Inagaki, ""The 47 Ronin"" by Mizoguchi, and NET's ""Dai Chushingura"", a 52-episodic TV serial.",1398902400,,3415,5.198181818181818

Just a lot of CGI.  It turned out to be a lot like what I imagined.  The settings were very non-descript and I never really got a feeling that it was taking place in Japan.  A lot of it looked like Middle Earth and I'm not sure where it was filmed but if I had to guess I would say New Zealand.  While watching the final scene of the heroine standing on a bridge I couldn't help but think the rest of the movie should have had that kind of scenery.

The action was muddled and actually pretty rare.  I don't like mindless action films that are relentless but with not much interesting going on the lack of action was more pronounced.  There is a scene set at night with a field on fire that was so poorly lit it was hard to tell what was going on.  The final set piece was pretty well choreographed.

It was odd that the fights were completely bloodless to get the PG-13 rating yet there were several beheadings.

The acting was good; I especially liked the actress that played the Witch.  God bless Keanu Reeve but his acting is so wooden.  I've noticed in his later movies he tends to play the silent type, I don't know if that's coincidental or by design.  Despite his lack of acting chops I like him for some reason.

Keanu Reeves plays a support role to the main hero in the story who is a samuri avenging his master's lost honor. Woven into the story is a bit of Japanese mythology and lore around witchcraft and demons. When you finally see the witch transform into a dragon, the dragon face itself is one of the best done that i have seen in film.  The CG on it was wonderful.

1104023,3,6305828075,"IT SHOULD HAVE been better.

My niece and I were anxious to catch 47 Ronin after watching the previews at our local cineplex. We like Keanu Reeves, and the wonderful dragon that appears at movies finale captured our fangirl hearts. Gotta admit, too, I like co-star Hiroyuki Sanada of Syfys Helix. Actually, the film is packed with good actors and Reeves seems perfectly happy to be playing his part and working with them as seen in the extra Keanu and Kai. Its as if hes working on a completely different movie.

That might be true. The script comes from Chris Morgan, who penned two Fast and Furious flicks, and Hossein Amini of the radically uneven Snow White and the Huntsman. Carl Rinsch, with only a few video shorts under his belt, was picked to direct. Rumor has it Universal Studios continually tweaked the costly production, firing Rinsch during the edit when his original cut came in at three hours; the show now runs around two. The end result leaves us with a lot of big, lush scenes, but little opportunity for character development and unforgivably lousy pacing.

The original story is simple  yet complex in the unique way of Asian culture. Good Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) is forced to commit ritual suicide after being framed by the evil Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano). The makes the 47 men of Asanos samurai guard ronin. Tradition would have them also commit seppuku, but the men first clear their masters name and avenge him before following Lord Asano in death. This new version blends historical events with magic and mythological creatures, including a witchy fox spirit in cahoots with Kira. Rinko Kikuchi gives her a slinky-evil lan not seen since Disneys animated Maleficent. Reeves Kai is a foundling, raised and trained by supernatural beings; he is discovered and sheltered by Lord Asano, becoming the key to dealing with the storys mystical mayhem.

Argh! This should have been one good, rollicking adventure!

The 2-D Blu-ray has a 1080p picture that seems a bit flat compared to others of its ilk; detail is sharp, however, and color is rich. Lighting is imaginative and energetic, and close-ups show good skin tones. The 3-D visuals are another story, losing opportunities to create a genuine, three-dimensional world, although several fight sequences and a snow scene look very good. Even so, a head prop looks so fake, it belongs in a high school production. CGI effects sometimes appear flat and take us out of the moment.

Sound is another matter, with a 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack that creates a terrific surround experience.

HD bonus features are short and of the PR variety. Obviously, theres no directors commentary, but Rinsch appears in the making-of feature, Re-forging the Legend. We learn that everything  from armor and weapons to sets and costumes  was manufactured for the movie.

Costume designer Penny Rose says, They wanted a very glamorous and quite strong look to it. Costumes and make-up blend period and contemporary styles. It works most of the time. When it doesn't, it fails badly as in the high-collared kimonos worn by Asanos daughter, and Asanos gray, page-boy hairstyle. (Shades of Prince Valiant!)

Myths, Magic & Monsters: The FX of 47 Ronin and Steel Fury: The Fights of 47 Ronin are self-explanatory.

Bottom line, 47 Ronin is a flawed movie. Its not the first time a film was sacrificed to a committee and it won't be the last. A re-edit could salvage it, creating the vision Reeves and Rinsch hoped for.

It seems the only role he was ever able to do well naturally is the ""surfer dude.""

1104203,5,6305828075,"I cannot imagine a better movie to acquaint westerners with this Japanese story that is so key to their culture. I have seen an earlier Japanese version and I failed to connect with its outdated cinematic techniques. With 47 Ronin I really got the feel of bushido and the way of the warrior samurai. These intentions are universal but the 1700's

are not within popular western cultural interests, usually, so bringing in a well known actor (Keanu Reeves) brought focus and believability to the scenes of battle and impossible love. No one pulls off demon fighting and magical elements like Reeves. And no one is better at being repressed, abused, and stigmatized and still coming round to everyone's aid like Reeves does.

He is a hero within an ensemble group of heroes. I enjoyed getting more familiar with the Japanese actors. The female characters were not weaklings. Universal themes of cowardice and deception for personal gain were clear. I felt the movie was very well done from start to finish. I believe they accomplished what they set out to do. Exciting battle scenes and quiet dramatic scenes were well balanced throughout the movie. Exquisite cinematography throughout. Costumes looked authentic to me. Hair and makeup not overdone to make it all the more believable. I loved the minimalist dialogue and some of it has a familiar ring to it. The fantasy elements were second to none. The 3D was an added dimension but I feel this movie will be equally as good in 2D. You cannot see a more culturally enlightening story with more fantasy elements woven within it. I can fully recommend this movie.",1397606400,2,1611,4.875912408759124

This film has a great sense of Japanese culture and Samurai adventure. The only drawbacks for me were the amount of CG used in the film, I bleieve there was too much of it. Lastly, everything seems so clean from the environments to the clothing of all the cast members that it seems superficial at times. I also wish that the Japanese actors would have spoke in Japanese with english subtitles, I mean here is this incredible story that takes place in Japan yet everyone speaks only in english.

I'm still wondering why he was trying to be Japanese in the first place? Why not just find a Japanese actor?! I have no idea WHY Rick Genest was in it either.

One of the few things that disappointed me was that no where in the movie did Keanu Reeves say ( I know Kung Fu ). I really think that this should be his catch phase as much as he has been crucified over it. Sure it would have been stupid for the sake of the movie, however it could have been an iconic classical cult classic laugh that I personally would have found endearing.

Underlying tones of racism and oppression, with very nice graphics that didn't make things look cheesy at all.

A niggling point is that I would have preferred to have had the actor's all speaking Japanese with subtitles. I understand this was a film meant for Western audiences, but it's a story of Japanese history and cultural identity so pandering to an audience by dumbing (or dubbing) down the material just seems wrong.

The acting is particularly good on the part of many of the supporting characters and Keanu Reeves delivers his part well without diversifying much from the roles we've already seen him do.

The action and special effects are quite good. I recommend renting this title on HD.",1397088000,,720,4.744

The boy learns of the ways of a samurai as he lives among them, but because of his roots (Kai) he's not acknowledged by other samurai and is known as ""half-breed""...

1104857,5,6305828075,"I had always figured Reeves as a fluff actor. He didn't seem capable of more than a few facial expressions and his faith in efficacy of his expression of emotion through body language was, shall we say, unfounded. But after watching 47 Ronin, I have been forced to reassess my opinion. He is absolutely fantastic in this film. I could break down the reasons for this change into descriptive, exacting analysis of the wonderful job of acting he pulled off, but the important thing, the essence of it, is this: I believed him. Instead of watching the movie thinking, ""There's Keanu Reeves acting like such-and-such a character,"" I forgot it was Keanu Reeves. That is high praise for any actor. When you watch an actor, even your favorite actor, portraying a role and you forget it's your favorite actor and believe that he is the character he is portraying, then you know the actor has done a good job. Reeves not only does a good job here, he excels. I am now looking forward to seeing more of his work rather than just feeling a yawning state of acceptance if an interesting movie comes along that happens to have him in it. I don't know what he's done to effect this change in his acting, but whatever it was, it worked.",1397088000,2,1221,4.529411764705882

This is not what I consider Oscar worthy but it is a still a great movie. I will buy it and watch it again and again because I enjoy the story and the entire cast of characters, not to mention the beautiful places it was shot. So get a grip, folks. Just because Keanu Reeves is IN a movie, he doesn't and shouldn't be expected to carry the whole load. He shined SHARING the stage with these other wonderful actors.

For one, the skeleton guy that was prominent in the poster and advertising had a 45 second spot, then that's it.  His character could have been better developed. It also was a cross between historical and mythical- like lord of the rings, Japanese style. It doesn't hold a candle to the last samurai, even with Tom Cruise.",1397088000,,441,4.378048780487805

The trailers show segments of the action, with fantastic creatures and abilities, but those are added on to what is suppose to be a story based on true events. I feel the two ideas conflict with each other, as the fantasy elements while interesting are not a part of the historical events. Also I was disappointed that the 45 other Ronin did very little. The movie focuses on two characters and doesn't give the other Ronin much to do or development.  In the classic 7 Samaria, each character was unique and brought something to the story,  I know it would be impossible to do that for 47 characters, but I also think it could have been expanded to at least a top 10 or 12 guys.  This is not a bad movie but I think it has an identity crisis, trying to be several things at once and kind of falling short at everything it is trying.",1397088000,,918,4.325581395348837

Maybe the reviewers were overreacting.  The story was pretty much your standard Asian action fare.  The special effects weren't memorably bad.  This was totally watchable.

While the special effects are competent, the CGI scenery well imagined and the costumes fairly well done, with the exception of the early '70s astronaut suit worn by the evil lord in his introductory scene, nothing else rises above the level of an average World of Warcraft fan script.

Keanu has populated his world with giant monsters, witches, killer mutant monks, bizarrely tattooed Portuguese, magic swords and mutants, but refuses to explore any of them in favor of showing his bland, expressionless face over and over again.  His character advances through the plot tediously and without a hint of the deep personal conflicts and ethical questions that the 47 ronin actually faced, nor with any real physical challenge to his character's skill or intelligence.  The ending is so swift and easy that the movie misses it and plods on for another 15 minutes.  The only notable thing is the actor who plays the Shogun is the same who played the villain in the first Mortal Kombat movie.  My friends and I spent the whole time yelling out ""Your soul is MINE!"" while he scowled on screen for no reason.

A far better film, that fully explores the same basic plot is 13 Assassins or any of the Lone Wolf and Cub series.  Save yourself the 6$ and go elsewhere.",1396828800,3,1463,4.68359375

Enter an evil Samurai that uses a witch to disgrace the good Samurais clan so that he can wed the clan leaders daughter.  They are outcast and become Ronin.

1105689,3,6305828075,"47 Ronin is entertaining enough, but I'd question whether it's worth the $15 price tag. Personally I'd say don't expect too much - the movie isn't some deep narrative or good historical fiction. Special effects are all good and well, but they are just tools and more often than not they fail to adequately compensate for weak plot.

Originally, 47 Ronin looked to me like it was going to be some obscenely shallow, fantasy Japanese version of 300 (tattooed samurai & giant metal samurai-knights), but in the end it turned out to be average if a bit dull. The story is fairly standard - low-born outcast proves his worth in a classic ""rescue the princess from the treacherous, greedy bad guy story"". Honestly, I would have preferred a movie about the actual 47 Ronin - or a modern version of something like ""the 7 Samurai"". It's fine to stick to tried & true narrative lines, but it needs good character development to work which I didn't really see in the movie - there's just too much quick exposition of character relationships rather than natural demonstration of bonds.

I'd like for there to be a samurai movie that didn't need a white protagonist to save the helpless Japanese people, though the rise of an outcast foreigner could work well if done right. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to happen in this movie. Most of the characters are just so painfully static.

 Keanu Reeves plays a dutiful, skilled, humble & decent guy - & that's all he ever really is throughout the entire movie (he gets a little bit more assertive). There just isn't a real sense of adversity, loss, or change in his character - he more or less stoically toughs through everything. He escapes the fighting pit with no injuries or casualties. He easily out-duels the mystical Tengu to get swords & the his companions apparently come back to life or something. He drops his sword, but gets it back just in time to kill the charging villain - gosh, never seen that before. He's never really wounded & never really in the position of making a no-win decision. Compared to something like Katsumoto's last stand in ""the Last Samurai"", or all of Wallace's trials in ""Braveheart"", the ""adversities"" in 47 Ronin is pretty much filler until a dull action scene comes up - I just didn't care because everything was so shallow & predictable.

And the other characters aren't really any better developed either. The other 46 samurai are the ""I misjudged you"" guys (& mostly unidentifiable). The princess is the damsel in distress who loves an outcast. The greedy, rival lord is the greedy, rival lord. The sorceress is twisted side-kick. etc. None of the main good guys actually die (I don't even think any of the 47 samurai died) in any of the fight scenes - no real stakes, no real excitement/tragedy/joy. Granted, pretty much all of the good guys die at the end from seppuku, but it feels kind of tacked on - & again there is a limited amount of connection to the samurai committing suicide because you only kind of know two of them.

So all in all, not a terrible movie, but not exactly the thriller or masterpiece on Japanese culture some people seem to think it is.",1396483200,5,3142,4.662454873646209

I am really into different genres and i do love the wushu type fantasy funfu samurai movies but this one is a no no. I will gladly give it 1 star but knowing the director wasted 175M to produce the movie i will give it a 2 star.

The director wants us to believe that there is an intimate relationship between Reaves and the princess. Well he didn't do a good job in persuading me. Half breed name was used way too much. So the samurais are racist?

The second insult is that the actors talk English, broken English at that. IF Reeves was a great actor and took his form seriously why not learn Japanese and speak Japanese or better yet Dutch and Japanese like his character?

Here. I'll analyze it so you don't have to. Now you can sit back and enjoy it.

I wondered why. It has a high budget feel, kudos on the cinematography, very good effects, strong storyline, the days of Keanu not being able to act are over, so what was it?

Ah.
The story has been 'westernized'. Its not overacted, precisely, just modern western gestures and attitudes layered over ancient Japan. It had to kind of explain why what was happening was an issue. That's what was off.

The true gestures and attitudes of the time period would have been almost imperceptible. The daughter would never have shamed herself with such obvious gestures and defiance. The thick emotional telegraphing amongst the players/people/samurai would have been political and literal suicide.

On the other hand, how would you explain the nuances/moral of 'little red riding hood' to someone who didn't grow up with the story?

Now, having said all that, once I finished deconstructing it, I was able to suspend my belief and get into the movie. It should have gotten more marketing.

I'll cut to the chase. Keanu Reeves is good during action scenes, but his voice and lines really doesn't help the movie. It lacks strength and conviction to fulfill his movie role, especially when we're referring to the main protagonist. The movie flow is choppy and continuously disconnects me from any possible emersion.

The end enemy as seen in the trailer is a dragon. Compare that to the much earlier (and much more interesting) beast seen in the movie and it is boring and obviously overdone (restraining myself from releasing spoilers). Asians and dragons? Who would've known?

The story is ridiculously overdone and straightforward. No surprises whatsoever, no twist, nothing unique, creativity of any sort was busy taking a number 2.

The move has a strong plot and a story line that continuously keeps you guessing. The movie is a strong blend of adventure and science fiction, and fans of either genre will enjoy this film.

Do I know the real story? Yes I do. Was I offended or disappointed they decided to add a little sci-fi fantasy to it? Not really. Seems like most people have a quarrel with that. Could they have made it more historically accurate? Yes they could have. I do wish however it would have been in Japanese. For what it is though I enjoyed it immensely. I could be a little biased seeing how I am a huge Keanu Reeves fan. He's not every ones cup of tea. On the bright side more Americans will learn about the story. Keanu plays a big role (his character was created for the film), but the story focuses more on Hiroyuki Sanada's role. Sanada owns his character and is an outstanding actor. I will definitely be looking up some of his other films. You want lots of sword action with a story about honor & respect? Look no further.

1106214,4,6305828075,"This film does not deserve five stars, but it is so much better than most of the major reviewers have said. Having seen and read various interpretations of this story, this was by far not the worst. Visually it is very engaging, the acting is good, they maintain many elements of the original story, and intertwined a variety of magical elements, which I think were not only for visual appeal, but also to move the focus away from the court culture of the Shogunate, and simplify the storytelling. The best feature, in my opinion, has to be Oishi, played by Hiroyuki Sawada. He fills the role incredibly well and I basically think he carries much of the film. So there, I really liked it.

But its only four stars. Though I do not consider myself a Japanese film aficionado, I think it would have been greatly improved by having the dialogue in Japanese and subtitle it in English. I know that a large part of the American audience has a serious aversion to subtitled films, but that would have given the already talented actors more free reign to work with. And Keanu Reeves... what can I say? He is not as bad as most say, and he does a fine job in the movie, but it is lame that his character was created to carry the film to western audiences. Still, he is not that bad, and he does not make it a bad film. And I did enjoy the fact that (SPOILER ALERT... well, at least for the first five minutes) that the only way they could bring him to the level of the otherwise awesome samurai is to give him supernatural abilities.

1106422,4,6305828075,"First I would like to say that I give the director props for not completely Americanizing the story of the 47 Ronin. For those of you that don't know the ronin were real people and the events they went through were also real however this movie brings their history in and mixes it Japanese mythology in by bringing in demons and magic. I did like how Keanu Reeves's character was seen as a dirty inbred because in that era it was extremely taboo to be mixed race and that is how many were treated. By the way, Keanu is mixed himself. He's English, Native Hawaiian, Chinese, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry so he's not really ""white"" he's mixed.

The actors were great in their roles and were all grade-A Japanese actors in Japan. I mainly watched this movie for Jin Akanishi who plays Oishi's son Chikara but I knew the rest of Japanese actors from previous dramas and movies I've watched in the past.

The reason why I give this a 4 is because the movie tended to drag in certain areas and I found some of Keanu's lines kind of corny sounding which I think is because they are lines better said in Japanese than English. The other reason I give this movie a 4 is because of the promotion and the way the product itself is held. I found the cover and even the special features a bit racist/prejudice for the reason being that they don't focus on any other characters in the film except the ""white"" dude. The guy with the skeleton face paint is only in the movie for 1 minute so I don't even know why he's on the cover it should be Oishi and his son like the Japanese cover. The whole movie is about Kai and Oishi's friendship along with their relationships between the rest of the ronin and how the unite while looking passed prejudice of Kai being different and defeating the witch that is creating havoc while restoring their honor and revenge for their slain master. The cover doesn't show any of that just a bunch of white looking people and one evil asian woman. This is why I decided to buy the imported bluray instead of the american version.

Other than that small issue I have with the promotational part of the product I do think people should give it a shot and watch it. It's def not the best version of the 47 ronin but it's really good for those that don't like to read subtitles.",1395619200,4,2293,4.377934272300469

1106424,5,6305828075,"Not only does this movie retell the legend of the 47 Ronin with respect, but it does so in a fantastical way that adds an entertaining depth.  The tale is retold with vivid creativity.  The effects are excellent.  The action is superb.  Solid writing alongside skillful acting really brings these characters to life.

Don't listen to other reviewers who trash Keanu's part.  Keanu in fact DOES play one of the main characters, not a peripheral or throwaway character designed to get you to watch the movie.  His character, Kai, is extremely important.  Linked to the demonic Tengu and the main love story in the plot.  Remove Kai and you have no story.

This movie does everything well.  The plot twists, asks a lot of the characters, and never feels too linear or designed for our heroes to win.  In fact, they often go up against some really challenging predicaments and barely come out on top, through interesting and thrilling action, subterfuge, and magic.

The only flaw?  Why is that tattooed guy on the cover?  He has the smallest part and is definitely under-used.

The monsters are done well.  The action is exciting.  You cannot go wrong here.  BUY IT.  Especially if you are a fantasy or action lover.",1395619200,3,1213,4.740384615384615

Having said this, the acting and story itself was done very well and really got into the details of the dogma of the time. Keanu Reeves character may be looked upon as dry or poor acting by some standards but I believe that he played the part of a house guest turned servant very well, and I hope that everyone understands that there is no main character in this film, it is a culmination of its moving parts.

Though I still feel that he's not an actor with a ton of depth, roles like this really suit his style and abilities.  The story line stays on track with the actual story of the 47 Ronin.  They gave their all to be true to their lord and to live their lives with the honor.  Sad as the story is, it's one worth hearing again.  This world we live in now could learn more than a thing or two from their example.",1395619200,5,643,4.088

The plot was predictable and the fight scenes were a little above average. If I was going to compare it to some of the great Japanese culture films such as Seven Samurai and 13 Assassins it would rate a B. If I would compare it to Chinese culture films such as IP Man, Fearless, Hero, Shaolin, Red Cliff, Saving General Yang, Little Big Soldier, and True Legend I would give it a C+ to B-.

If you enjoyed any or all the films I just listed, this movie merits a purchase/rental and a watch. Some other films to help compare the genre are War of Arrows, Legend of the First, Detective Dee Mystery of the Phantom Flame, Wu Dang, Dororo, The Warriors Way, and Bunraku.

I will say that I absolutely loved the weight of the drama in this film.  It was as strong an element to the film as the action sequences showcasing the samurais swordsmanship which I really enjoyed.
The strong emphasis on Feudal Japans class system and how Keanus character was treated subhuman really felt accurately portrayed for the time period.  To my relief, Keanu wasn't the focus of this film, the centerpiece was the drama which unfolded with the samurai.  And it really felt like a great deal of respect was being paid to the original source material and the overall time period.  My only gripe about this film and I found myself saying this the entire movie, was I wish they were speaking in Japanese so I couldve put on the subtitles.  It wouldve made it feel far more authentic.  BUT a small gripe for a superb film.
Lastly, my recommendation to anyone who watched this film and enjoyed it, grab Rorouni Kenshin The Movie.  I own it on Blu-ray in Japanese, if you liked this movie youll like Kenshin.",1395532800,5,1190,4.502325581395349

The action was weak, the characters were flat and two-dimensional, and even what little story there was seemed to be handled by people unwilling to truly grasp the concept of the 47 Ronin, instead choosing to appease a limited Western audience (teenagers and children). The only people who would like this movie are those that are not looking for actual plot or storyline, and only watch films for the special effects (the Michael Bay set).

He's being called a half breed, but is never explained why. There are so many supernatural forces it becomes hardly credible, from beasts, to witches, to demons in the forest to magic. None of the fight scenes are amazing. There's supposed to be some sort of love interest but I don't know who'd buy it. The special effects were cheap. The cinematography in the beginning was going for an artsy feel but just felt choppy and unnecessary. It does get better towards the end. Everyone dies in the end. Not sure if I was supposed to be saddened by the story or happy the movie ended. It wasn't that feel good type either. Not really sure what they were going for. A documentary from the history channel would have been more interesting and exciting. Definitely lost some hours of my life watching this movie.

Keanu Reeves stars in an otherwise mostly authentic Asian cast in this samurai/fantasy movie about a group of (you guessed it) 47 Ronin who set out to avenge a plot by a rival clan which resulted in the death of their master.  The story is quite simple and easy to follow.  The one actress that stands out is Rinko Kikuchi as Mizuki the Witch who brings a nice sense of nastiness to the role.  Reeves plays a wildly miscast half-Japanese, half British outcast who was raised in a forest by demons and has some magical powers as well as being a bad-ass fighter.  Reeves delivers his customary performance in the role which is razzie-worthy to say the least.  He also seems to be getting a little flabby in his middle age.  There's a number of fantasy sequences involving magical dragons, demons and forest creatures (that look like Avatar rejects) which feature decent to mediocre CGI effects.  Probably the poison spider bit works the best and is genuinely creepy.

Ronin defined as being a Samurai without a master, normally a very low rank, only slightly better then a cutthroat or mercenary.

I'd already seen and enjoyed the numerous versions which would all be considered more traditional. Knowing this I also predicted that there was no modern audience especially in America that would shell out their hard earned cash to see a movie filled with nothing but Samurai in Feudal Japan. Thankfully I wasn't greeted by A two hour long explosion, Big Breasted Women, Ewoks, Smurfs or Slapstick Humor. HollyWeird doesn't exactly have a great track record for doing the right thing. This story is incredible and deserves to be done right and though this is indeed a HollyWeird Blockbuster it retains the Heart and Soul that is the Legend of the Honorable 47 Ronin.

1106660,5,6305828075,"Gorgeously shot, vividly imagined, heavy and heartfelt - this movie should not be skipped by true fantasy-adventure fans.

I can see why mainstream America and the media misunderstood it - Asian protagonists, brooding tone, tragic romance, a plot driven by foreign ideals like ""honor"" and ""shame."" People with no exposure to a traditional Japanese world might scratch their head at the notion of seppuku, or leaving your wife to avenge lost honor, but if you are worldly enough to embrace different cultures and values, you will be rewarded by this richly imagined film.

Thematically, this movie is smart. First, the film is refreshingly devoid of any irony or post-modern humor that can weaken the modern blockbuster, which always seems to try to be all things to all people. So while the plot may be simple, it is still told in surprising ways. One can never entirely predict the next thing to happen throughout the movie, another novel way the movie is better than expected.

And the execution of this revenge yarn is layered with heavier topics like class, morality, equality and freedom. One of the two main protagonists is a low-class ""half-breed"" (actually half-demon) while the rest are pure Japanese. This intriguing character faithfully serves his masters while tolerating their cruelty, finally proving by the end to be transcendentally superior to all of their humiliation and ignominy. With a movie about slavery likely to take home Best Picture for 2013, it's a shame that this particular genre film is so easily dismissed by critics although it also delves into the difficult subject with an insightful and intelligent perspective. But again, the average member of the audience is probably a little taken aback by their hero grovelling for mercy to a holy emperor, when the typical American badass hero would simply shoot first.

The film is also a triumph on the technical end. If the wild monsters, ghosts, demons and witches don't appeal to you visually - all rendered in sleek new ways heretofore unseen in an American film - then perhaps the lush backgrounds and intricate costumes will entertain you in even the slowest scenes. Score, cinematography, editing, sound, acting - the movie is exquisitely made and best enjoyed on the biggest screen.

So despite being oddly pro-suicide, the movie is simply astounding. It is a genuine cinematic masterpiece, especially for its unique historical Japanese backdrop. To the right pallet, there are few movies better at what they do than this.",1391385600,246,2507,5.090024330900243

The main theme is loyalty which is a good idea. However, the acting and directing make it boring. I am not touched by the perseverance of the samurais in avenging their master's death. I do not care for them.

The special effects look fake most of the time, especially the beast in the first scene and the dragon in the later. I cannot understand why the movie costs 175 million dollars but the effects are so bad.

The sword fighting scenes look dull compared to other Asian-made fantasy movies such as some of good Chinese-made ones. There is no excitement, no suspense, and no entertainment. Keanu Reeves's talent has been wasted here. I prefer him in the Matrix.

Production Budget: $175 million
Domestic:  $38,049,000
+ Foreign:  $83,700,000
= Worldwide:  $121,749,000

So, it is a big flop in North America. It lost more than 130 million dollars. Worldwide, it took in more than 121 million. That is a huge amount. However, it still lost more than 50 million due to its outrageous cost of 175 million. It is a staggering loss.",1390521600,8,1223,4.758293838862559

The evil martial artists named, the fox, in crouching tiger and hidden dragon was more suspenseful and action oriented.  The intensity was better.

1106737,4,6305828075,"47 Ronin is based on the legend of the 47 ronin who avenged the death of their master at the hands of Lord Kira, but in this film, the addition of fantasy elements and massive scale help make the film more memorable. When the 47's master is killed and the 47 become scattered, Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) tracks down Kai (Keanu Reeves), a half-Japanese half-British warrior to help bring the 47 back together to fight Lord Kira and his army before all of Japan is lost.

47 Ronin is actually a fantastic movie that got very poor reviews from critics because, well, it shares a lot with other movies like 300 and Immortals in terms of plot elements, but the film is much more intriguing, and has better action if you ask me. The script was good, but not anywhere near as good as it could have been. I'm just hoping they release an extended cut on disc because, well, they could easily add 15-20 minutes to the movie, as character development for the Witch (Rinko Kikuchi) was almost entirely absent. The directing was great, but with the editing, there were a few too many cut-away scenes. The acting was superb, especially from the two leads (Sanada and Reeves), with Sanada stealing the show in a few scenes. The visual effects were top notch, and some of the best of the year (It better get the Oscar nomination for Art Direction and/or Visual Effects). Then, the musical score. This is the best thing the theatrical version of the film has to offer, being an epic mix of action-adventure and emotion-charged cues. I'm really mad at movie-goers for not seeing this film at the theaters, and i don't really know why it did poorly. Are people just not interested in adventure films anymore? Because this is one of the best adventure movies of all time, easily, even if the characters aren't original. Oh and also, at the end of the film it does state it is ""inspired by the true story,"" not that it was a fully based-on or accurate portrayal of events, as some people had thought this film was supposed to be. And i personally think the fantastical elements helped make the film stand out as a good adaptation of this incredible story, because at that time in Japan, mystery and myth were a part of their daily lives.

4/5 Stars****

*UPDATE* It didn't get a single nomination at the Oscars or Globes. Kind of pathetic, especially when the CG in this was better than that of Iron Man 3, the musical score was better than Philomena and Her, and had better costume designs than American Hustle.",1389744000,3,2488,4.56152125279642
1106738,3,6305828075,"I went into 47 Ronin wanting to geek out on some samurai action. As a
practitioner of Iaido, I like to see sword play done right. I'm also a
big fan of fantasy, and based on the trailer, I did expect that element
to be strong. Sure, this portrayal of the 47 Ronin is only loosely
related to the traditional story, but I'm cool with that. It's almost a
shame that the screen writers tethered their cart to a well known tale,
because I think the world could use more fantasy epics adorned with the
rich cultural trappings of feudal Japan. A story liberated from the
traditional structure entirely might have spread its wings a little
more. If The Lord of the Rings can put magic and monsters in a world
inspired by a version of Medieval Britain, then why not give the same
treatment to the knights and dragons of the East?

Overall I was entertained. The mash up of witchcraft, demon monks,
monsters, and the samurai code of honor is a chemistry that mostly
works, and the film is beautiful to look at. The costumes are
gorgeous*, the sets, cinematography and effects all feel cohesive and
immersive, and the pace is brisk. Clocking in at just over two hours,
it might have been a little too brisk, because where 47 Ronin falls
flat for me is in the acting and character development.

The shape-shifting witch, (the true villain of the story) has some of
the coolest effects, and could have been a thrilling character. Her
concept and design were great. But I couldn't take the character
seriously, as she was totally undermined by bad casting and weak
acting. And Kai, the mysterious half-breed sort-of-central hero played
by Keanu Reeves, suffers from a similar lack of depth and development.
He feels grafted onto the story as a plot device, a cynical way to give
Western audiences a Caucasian to relate to.

The canvas may be 3D, but most of the dialog felt 2D to me. I read in
Variety that the lines for the Japanese actors were simplified because
they had to read the English phonetically, but at times it feels like
they did the same thing for Keanu.

Hiroyuki Sanada makes up for a lot of this in the role of Oishi,
arguably the main character, even though you won't find his face on the
posters. I've enjoyed his acting in everything I've seen him in so far
(check out The Twilight Samurai for something more authentic) and he
really carries this version of 47 Ronin on his back. The story of his
quest for revenge feels like it has some weight. The risk and cost to
his family actually resonates, but isn't given enough time at center
stage because we're distracted by a forbidden love subplot between Kai
and the daimyo's daughter Mika. This love story is an element that ends
up lacking that same resonance, in spite of overwrought attempts to
invoke passion simply by viewing the relationship through a lens tinted
with the beauty and poetry of old Japan.

Forgive my harping on the comparison, but if the Hobbit movies are too
long (and I think they are, much as I loved the LOTR trilogy) then 47
Ronin may well be too short. Other unfulfilled potentials included the
story of how Kai trains and acquires his sword skills on the Dutch
island of Djema where we get a brief look at a cool character tattooed
with a skull face. Unfortunately, this guy is just another element that
teases us in the poster and trailer, but gets little screen time.

After reading the awesome novel, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob DeZoet
by David Mitchell, I was hungry to see more of Djema, and hoping that
the filmmakers might exploit the potential for bringing out some of
Kai's backstory there, or at least digging into the rich juxtaposition
of cultures offered by the Dutch island, but no. Didn't happen. By the
way, if you want a story that blends samurai culture and Japanese
history with subtle sorcery, do yourself a favor and read that book. It
does a much better job in the romance department as well.

By the end of the film Kai's character is as much of an enigma as when
we first met him crashing out of the forest with claw scars on his
head. An unsatisfying journey to be sure. But I do have to give the
filmmakers some credit for keeping to the traditional ending, and
guaranteeing that there won't be a sequel.

Unlike another reviewer who chose to discuss and judge the values of that time rather than the movie itself, those values must be respected as an historical accuracy.  That review would be much like giving ""Gone With the Wind"" one star for the South's reliance on slavery.

Keanu Reeves plays the ""half-breed"" (sorry, but it is the term they use in the movie.)  Keanu grew up with a different group, where he learned a different way of life/survival actually.  He was found by the ruler of an area and brought to live with his people.  The Samauri warriors did not like Keanu, even though he did everything he could to please, honor, and respect them.  Although Keanu was an extremely skilled warrior, he was not one of them--not of their blood--no matter what he did.

1106846,5,6305828075,"This movie tells the historical story of the 47 ronin with a magical, mythical, fun aspect added to it.

It is very exciting and moving. The loyalty of the ronin to their fallen lord is inspiring.

The love story between two of the characters was touching as well without being overbearing, it did not hijack the plot which happens in many films. They also stayed true to feudal japanese societal rules to a greater degree than many movies.

For example some movies set in feudal japan will have a peasant ""half breed"" (keanu reeves character) somehow have status and respect from samurai which is highly unlikely bordering on absurd. In this film the half breed is considered much lower than the samurai and he accepts this. Its not until they become ronin that they get closer to equals and then the half breed starts talking back instead of just quietly accepting his lower status. This is much more reasonable, helps plot development, and is smart of the writer/director to understand the feel of feudal japan.

The special effects and mythical elements are very well done! There is a magical witch and a few spirits and creatures from classical japanese mythology.

The fight scenes are really well done and well choreographed.

I have nothing bad to say about this movie other than it could have been longer! Its already two hours but could have used another to give background on the samurai's lives and the elements of japanese mythology.

I already knew these things going in so hearing the name of a japanese mythological entity or when a person is asked to be anothers ""second"" for sepukku, i was primed for what came next. However the person who saw it with me had no idea what these things were and is in fact the one who gave the critique that it could have been longer to give more detail on these points.

Overall amazing film. Its now on my top ten list!",1388361600,110,1871,4.6314199395770395
1106847,2,6305828075,"Nine Things about 47 Ronin

1. This Keanu Reeves fantasy action movie was misnamed. Instead of 47 Ronin, it should have been called 47 Things Wrong With This Movie.

2. Spoiler alert: The biggest problem with the movie is that it's a trick. While its supposed to be about 47 renegade warriors on a mission of vengeance, they only appear in like the last 10 minutes.

3. To be fair, its not complete crap. Its visually stylish and has great special effects. But thats about it.

4. The 47 Ronin actually did exist in real life. But I don't think they fought witch dragons or magical swordsmen.

5. This big-budget movie was entrusted to a brand new director, and he is clearly out of his depth. This movie is inconsistent in every way possible. The pacing is terrible. And while its interesting visually, the style seems to compete with itself, like two different movies were being made.

6. The whole movie feels like its on fast forward. It rushes through the plot, so that you don't have time to learn or care about the characters. Then it suddenly slows down for some stupid love story or discussion about honor.

7. For a movie about rage, vengeance, and doomed love, there is surprisingly little emotion in the film. Its fairly cold and one-dimensional. Its also not all that violent.

8. Sometimes the characters speak Japanese. Sometimes they speak English with a Japanese accent. Sometimes they speak English with a British accent. Keanu Reeves just sounds like Keanu Reeves.

9. The movie was supposed to have been released Christmas 2012. But they kept pushing it back so they could re-do parts of it. That's always a bad sign, and the results are right on the screen. Its a nice try, but it ends up collapsing under its own weight.",1388361600,11,1742,4.648208469055374
1106848,5,6305828075,"Enjoyed the movie, a must see in 3 D.

Beautiful Story , SFX and the display of the Japanese / Samurai code of Honor and the rules that they lived by. BUSHIDO.

I was surprised and intrigued to know that the 47 Ronins actually existed and every December 14th In Japan they have a ceremony in their honor.",1388275200,8,304,4.224137931034483
1106849,3,6305828075,"In 47 Ronin Keanu Reeves plays Kai, a half-human or an outcast with formidable fighting skills and supernatural powers, adopted by Lord Asano of Akou domain. Set in the fictional 18th-century feudal Japan, (where sword-wielding samurai fight a demonic creature and shape-shifting sorceress), the film looks like a curious mixture of jidaigeki (or Japanese period drama) and CGI-filled epic fantasy.

The story is loosely based on a popular kabuki play Chushingura (and countless Japanese movie and TV-show versions that followed, including Kenji Mizoguchis 1941 classic drama The 47 Ronin), about forty-seven ronin, or samurai without master, avenging the disgrace and death of their revered master Lord Asano (Min Tanaka). For Japanese, this story, which was inspired by real-life incidents that happened 1701-03, has been a famous one for more than four hundred years.

Hiroyuki Sanada (The Last Samurai The Wolverine) plays Oishi, a samurai faithful to Lord Asano. Tadanobu Asano (Battleship Thor) is Lord Kira, the villain of the story that secretly plans to take over Asanos fiefdom. Kou Shibasaki is Asanos daughter Mika and Rinko Kikuchi (Babel) is a mysterious woman using witchcraft.

The gorgeous sets and beautiful costumes are worth watching, and bearded, sword-fighting Keanu Reeves is pretty good, if a bit wooden, as the protagonist Kai, though Hiroyuki Sanada steals every scene he is in, as Kuranosuke Oishi, charismatic leader of the masterless samurai. Rinko Kikuchis performance as a witch almost becomes campy fun, whether intentionally or not.

For the new version of Chushingura Universal Studio hired writers Chris Morgan (responsible for the third and subsequent installments of The Fast and the Furious franchise) and Hossein Amini (Oscar nominated for The Wings of the Dove). Director is first-timer Carl Rinsch, who seems to be striving for artistic and entertainment values at the same time, but with limited success. More problematic is the disappointing visual effects and choppy editing that sometimes ruins the action part.

To me, the film seems not to know what it wants to be. At the center of the film is bushidou or samurai code of honor, which is overshadowed by fantasy elements. As a fantasy movie, action is few and far between. As a drama, the relationship between Keanu Reeves (fictional) character and the band of (real-life) ronin is not fully explored, and Kou Shibasakis character, love interest for Kai, is underdeveloped.

This is not to say that 47 Ronin is a bad movie. It is mildly entertaining big-budget movie that defies genre, an interesting blend of period piece and action fantasy (part inspired by Hayao Miyazakis Princess Mononoke), but I think the film would have been much better with a more focused approach to the subject matter.",1388102400,7,2794,5.2674157303370785
1106910,5,6305828075,I rated this movie high because I loved it. The story line was engaging the acting was top notch and the cinematography was beautiful. This movie is loosely based on a true story of 47 samurai who sacrificed their lives avenging the honor of their lord who they felt was unjustly killed. This story also has a tragic love story as a subplot. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie and me and my wife both cried during several scenes during this movie. Going into this movie one must understand that the actions of the characters are based on the cultural values that existed at that time in Japans history. Therefore the actions of the characters will be far different than people living in our current time and society.,1388102400,4,730,4.666666666666667
1106911,1,6305828075,"I'm sure none of you missed the racism in the opening, so there is no need to comment on that.

After the first action sequence, the hero allows an ""honorable"" samurai to lie about who killed the beast. There is nothing honorable about lying or permitting others to lie. Suicide is also an abomination, which must not be permitted or honored, as this film would have us believe.

When the Ronin go to a sect of alien Buddhists, their leader is required to watch his friends all be killed in front of him, without drawing his sword to help them, as a condition for being given weapons to hunt their enemies. Does no one else see how corrupt that idea is? How many of your friends would you see killed to obtain power?

The Ronin succeed in overthrowing the witches and demons, and they are honored by winning the right to kill themselves. No man has the righteous power to order another man to kill himself. King David's prayer to God for all nations is that their corrupt leaders be overthrown to remind them that they are men, not gods. Those Ronin should have overthrown and killed that presumptuous Shogun too, and the god-emperor as well. Then they would have been true heroes, worthy of honor, and we Japan would not have been a terror to its neighbors in WWII.

Do not make the mistake of buying into the Buddhist hokum and suicide cult of that disgraced nation, or we will have to crush them again.",1388016000,13,1405,4.4765625

1106913,4,6305828075,"When I saw the short trailer, I was worried that the film might be too campy or, worse, a twisted adaptation of a classic tale to create a vehicle for Keanu Reeves  la 'The Last Samurai'.  I needn't have worried.  Keanu's presence as Kai, a half-Japanese boy found and reared by a kind lord, is woven in seamlessly, and the other excellent actors, including Hiroyuki Sanada and Asano Tadanobu, are given equal opportunities to shine and show their chops.  And kudos to the director for respecting the story and ending on an appropriate note instead of the usual Hollywood finale (i.e happily ever after for everyone).

1106919,5,6305828075,"Although classified as a ""samurai movie"", Kenji Mizoguchi's brooding take on the tale of the forty-seven warriors who choose to commit hara-kiri rather than succumb to the disgrace of losing their clan title is anything but all-action. Although instructed by the military to make an aggressive warlike film, the master director opts for an awe-inspiring display of pure cinema, replete with classy, ultra-long takes and an air of slow-burning doom probably unmatched in cinema history.

It is indeed the way the story is filmed that is most breathtaking. Never has a film so perfectly paired up its thematic concerns with the style in which these themes are presented. The scenes in the film are rarely under five minutes each, with the camera relentlessly prowling around via tracking and boom shots. Furthermore, it says so much about its director that the long spaces between cuts are not obvious because of their unobtrusive nature. Instead, we are drawn into the story of the honourable ronin, who inhabit a world totally different from out own. Japanese audiences in 1941 found the film a little too different from their own world, as reflected in the poor performance at the box office.

The film forms part of a trilogy of totalitarian films about sacrifice, along with Eisenstein's ""Alenander Nevsky (1938) and the Nazi film ""Kolberg"" (1945): but in reality the ""47 Ronin"" is head and shoulders above both of these. Indeed, ""47 Ronin"" is one of the great masterpieces of world cinema, and awaits rediscovery.

DVD notes: Not a great transfer on this Korean DVD, but the film is in its intact (three hours forty-one minutes) form, and has full English subtitles.",1203724800,41,1670,5.021660649819495
