8171522,5,B000MRP3X0,"Watched the movie when it came out almost a decade ago, absolutely loved it. Watched it again today and felt the same. It's not a propaganda movie. The director used to be a reporter and documentary film maker. He travelled to many war zones in the world, including Afghanistan. He wrote a human story and tried to highlight various issues behind the never ending war in Afghanistan and it's current state. The movie also showed how reality is so different from what we have seen or known all along.",1520640000,,499,4.617977528089888

8171524,1,B000MRP3X0,This is propaganda film by India to discredit and malign Pakistan. Indian forces have used Afghanistan to promote their distorted version of the ground reality and demonize Pakistan. It is a one sided story by the powerful anti Pakistan machinery of India.,1477958400,,256,5.119047619047619

8171526,3,B000MRP3X0,"A bit heavy-handed ie lacking in subtlety, even by Bollywood standards it's a bit caricature-ish.  But still worthwhile.",1462492800,,120,5.666666666666667
8171527,5,B000MRP3X0,"This movie is a study on prejudices, cultural differences, loyalties and duty.  Very well done and gives some insight into the politics in Afghanistan following 9/11. As the story develops, the hated Taliban acquires a human face and becomes understood by his enemy. The end is fatalistic as in many asian movies.  Must use captions for English speaking audience.",1462060800,,363,5.135593220338983
8171528,5,B000MRP3X0,Love this movie. I suprisingly ended up liking the villain as they did in the movie.  I watched it twice in one day.,1451260800,,116,4.043478260869565
8171529,5,B000MRP3X0,"I know the story was suppose to be serious but the humor is just too much to ignore for me LOL. Great acting(from my fantasy boyfriend, John Abraham), great story and plot!",1395964800,,172,4.40625
8171530,5,B000MRP3X0,This is one the best movies ever made.  It is a must see for everyone.,1227571200,,70,3.6666666666666665
