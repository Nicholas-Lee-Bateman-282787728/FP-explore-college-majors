5087078,5,B007HOQ5FQ,THE BEST CRIME DOCUMENTART I'VE SEEN TO DATE!  I was raised uptown D.C and this was a typical day in the life.  I could relate to every aspect of this film.  However the ending was to abrupt...left me needing closure.,1344038400,3,217,4.375
5087079,4,B007HOQ5FQ,"I watched the movie and felt uneasy seeing that this was on film because this lifestyle does relate to many ""real ni**as"" who do what they do for survival, and growth but I kept on watching. This is raw and interesting footage, and it does leaves viewers questioning its validity.

The Bluff may be a project that is rough for folks from Atlanta but me being from Miami, this film felt real light. After watching it twice over, I did realize that a lot of it was fictional, but it was done extremely well. I hope that there is a superior motive for the release of this film and that Curtis may handle the forthcoming successes with a strategic plan to better himself and his community.

I gave the film 5 stars because it relates to me, and my community. I wish the best for Curtis Snow.

5087080,5,B007HOQ5FQ,"Snow On Tha Bluff is a crime/drama that plays out as a documentary (think ""found footage"" with a twist). The story follows Curtis Snow's life as a drug dealer after he steals a camera from some naive college kids. I highly recommend Snow On Tha Bluff.

What did I like? I enjoy the innovation this film brings to the found footage genre. It really feels like a realistic crime/drama film. It's a gritty and authentic portrayal of their lives. It's only an hour and 20 minutes, but it packs so much and it goes by fast; we see drug deals, robberies, and murders. It's has some powerful moments as well, like when Curtis Snow explains how the drugs have been in his family for a very long time and how his 2 year old son is in the same position as him. It's a controversial film because of how realistic it feels, so the actors did an amazing job.

What did i dislike? The ending was a little unfulfilling and abrupt. Some actions and dialogue felt off/forced.

Overall, it's a powerful and fast movie. It gives you a deep, authentic look into this lifestyle. As of 7/19/12, Snow on tha Bluff is available on Netflix Streaming you're still unsure, but it's definitely worth purchasing.

This movie has realistic violence and blood, excessive drug use and references, strong language, and brief nudity.",1342656000,8,1299,4.6103896103896105
5087081,5,B007HOQ5FQ,"This is how it is in the TRAP and the streets of the Dirty South

A jolt of, uh, dope into the veins of the micro-indie/found footage scene, ""Snow On Tha Bluff"" is a wildly kinetic tour through one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the United States; an endlessly entertaining and captivating portrait of a ""robbery boy"" and crack dealer. Filmmaker Damon Russel completely disappears, letting subject Curtis Snow carry the entire film, resulting in gritty, authentic document of the culture and lifestyle in Atlanta's favorite little quarters.
Starting with an audience surrogate of sorts, a group of nervous college kids head to the Bluff (a crime ridden area in Atlanta) in hopes of scoring some drugs. The male in charge shotgun tapes the entire experience, likely to show to his buddies the ""insane shit"" they had done that day. Well, he gets more than what he bargains for once he meets the dealer Snow -- after encouraging them to taxi him to his home, he brandishes a gun and the camera abruptly shuts off. When it resumes filming the Bluffian passes it off to a friend, situating himself in front of the camera to detail his various exploits. From then on the movie operates in cinma vrit style (with only a few passing acknowledgements to the presence of the camera), legitimately feeling like an amateur shooting his pals as opposed to an experienced cinematographer faking it.

While there is very little narrative to cling to, you won't care -- most of the interest is experiencing the undiluted way of living with someone very nestled into the lifestyle. It's nice to see the residents of the neighborhood with a non-judgmental eye, outside of the usual exploitative television program or issues doc. Our protagonist, talking a mile a minute, is a fascinating personality: we're with him as he throws parties, slings drugs, visits his baby and ""baby momma,"" and engages in drug-related robberies. He's more or less the king of the hill, and it's only a matter of time before someone attempts to dethrone him -- after a few compassionate sequences involving a tour of make-shift monuments to the deceased and a visit to his grandmother's house (where she suggests he get a good job), the subject gets shot off-camera by an unknown party. The police get involved and manage to arrest him on some vague charges, and the film picks up some time later after a brief stint in prison. Following the reunion festivities, Snow wastes no time in vocalizing his vengeful appetite, ignoring the fact that it's probably a bad idea considering he just got out of jail. Still, a move needs to be made and he quickly organizes a drive-by, thus setting into motion a nasty tug of war with severe consequences.

Given the style and the bookend framing device, there's an obvious ""found-footage"" conceit going on that's fooled quite a few people -- apparently, there were riots at the Atlanta Film Festival and Atlanta Police contacted the filmmakers because of the home invasions -- but honestly, it's not too hard to tell that it's a fictional narrative with enough collaboration and realism to make it feel true. However, given the strength of the filmmaking and its use of real locations and people, you're not likely to care one way or the other. There's a furious, untamed energy pulsating through the movie, and that's part of what makes it such a joy to watch despite some of the more disturbing moments. The more sensitive audience members might not be able to take things like the bizarre car ride where women freely strip, nor will they stomach a child wandering amidst a table full of crack cocaine. But these are some of the realities of the culture shown with a resolute eye: it's not meant to look cool, nor is it berating. It presents this world as it is, and leaves it for the viewer to mark with their own eye.

And with that train of thought, it's a relief that the filmmaker doesn't tack on a schmaltzy moral at the end of the story and though the finale is a bit brief and disappointing, it offers some optimism in an interesting way. The film retains its lyrical rawness, feeling like the next step in neo-realism. Immediate and unrelenting, ""Snow On Tha Bluff"" is unlike anything you'll see this year... unless, of course, you live in the Bluff.",1340928000,4,4267,4.762162162162162
5087082,5,B007HOQ5FQ,"This movie came across as a hard pill to swallow. I've lived in Atlanta for the past 15 years and the reality of it is, there are places like that, and people like these. The film goes into the life of a young man by the name of Curtis. He's a product of his environment and runs with his crew of young brothers. I have to point out, that while Curtis seems to be at least 27 in this movie, he's seldom found around kids 10 years younger than him. Basically he leads his team of misfits ass they run around the hood and pull licks (thefts) and celebrate with the team. The actions are usually reckless and leave you wondering if these guys are ignorant or just not afraid of jail- or death for that matter. However, the display of karma in the movie is well placed and recognized throughout the entire film. Curtis does suffer the repercussions for his actions. But with a lack of resources to even begin to straiten up, plus drug addiction fueled by emotional aggressive whims, we learn that our main character is stuck in his ways. With all this said the movie is true to the core. This is a superb depiction of the ignorant realities (especially in Atlanta) of when societies corner certain people and communities to the point where the need to survive outweighs the compassion for others. By cornering I mean societal, economical, and cultural neglect by the powers that be.",1339718400,25,1378,4.49402390438247

It's funny, it's interesting, it's sad, it's scary. I know neighborhoods like this, I know people who act/talk/dress/live like this, but minus all the fairly high street level drug dealing and robberies, etc.
These people are so real- and what's sad is that there's people trapped in these places and this lifestyle all over the country.

The level of realism was shocking to me and that's probably why I couldn't stop watching... wondering is this real??  I kept thinking no way.... this can't be real footage...

Very surprisingly I found myself actually caring about Curtis Snow by the end of the movie.  During the armed robbery in the beginning of the movie I about got sick to my stomach because it was very similar to something that happened to me years ago and it brought back all those old memories of rage and hate toward the ones who did it to me.  I HATED Curtis Snow and everything he stood for.  I felt all that old hatred come flooding back and nearly stopped watching... but I couldn't.  As the movie progressed, the interaction between Curtis and his child, the love I know he felt for that little baby was touching.  I felt my hate towards him start to melt, despite the horrible things he did in the movie.  Maybe it's because he never actually hurt anyone he was robbing, it was all a scare tactic to do the only thing he knew to survive.  The ghetto is an ugly place and I felt in myself a realization that Curtis really isn't the heartless f**k I at first believed him to be.  He's a product of his environment.

Absolutely gripping, intense and so, so, good.  Yes the movie has it's flaws, and there are scenes I could do without.  And sometimes there's a little too much shaky cam and night-vision blur for the sake of ""realism,"" in my opinion. But overall I highly recommend it -- if you can handle it.",1350691200,2,425,4.626666666666667

5087189,5,B007HOQ5FQ,"This was a very interesting movie. Curtis Snow is something else. We all either know someone like this or have someone like this in our family and that's real. I purchased this for my fiancee based on someone else's recommendation. It was crazy and it gives you an inside look at the life-style of someone who just cannot let go of the streets. The movie itself has some parts in it where the recording volume is low but those parts weren't all that interesting but I still would have loved to hear everything that was going on. The quality in some parts could be better. The part that was just heartbreaking is when someone else paid the price for what he did in the street. It's crazy because things like that happen all of the time. There was a time where no matter what you did in the street or what you did being a part of ""that life"" was never brought to the doorstep of your family's home. There was just a code that men honored but unfortunately Curtis didn't abide by any rules of the street. Whatever he wanted to do, it went down in that order. No respect, no love. There were times in the movie where I was thinking, is this for real? But some parts of it just could not have been faked. I felt for the young men in the movie because it seemed like they were phychologically trapped within themselves. The sad part is out of all the young men that were a part of this film, somebody is not going to live to see 30 (and I'm pushing it with 30). Other than that, it keep me interested. I'm sure things have gotten better financially for him with the sale of this movie that's if he stopped getting high and drinking and focuses his attention to raising his son.

Thirty minutes into the movie the disc scipped 10 chapters to the last two scenes of the movie. I was very dissapointed. Ive tried to watch the movie in three different dvd players and It scratches each time, at the same part in the movie. GREAT MOVIE, but i will never order another movie from amazon.
