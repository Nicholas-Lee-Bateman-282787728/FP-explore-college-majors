8588024,4,B001LWBM8U,"Overall, this is a great DVD to watch and own. Don Ross is the featured musician and performs very well live. Michael Manring performs second and provides a bazaar but very interesting set on the bass guitar. I've never seen a bass guitar solo act like this before.

Then comes Andy Mckee. His performance is the highlight of this DVD. Ross and Manring display wonderful talent, but Mckee finds a way to blend talent and masterful songwriting. If you haven't seen or heard of Andy Mckee, get on it.

I would have given this DVD a 5-star rating if it featured more Andy Mckee songs.",1375056000,,581,4.523809523809524
