2231619,3,B0007QS31A,"""Dastardly & Muttley In Their Flying Machines"" was no work of genius as was classic Road Runner cartoons (considering Mike Maltese was a writer for both entities), but given the climate of Saturday morning cartoons in 1969, it was acceptable. A spin-off of the previous year's ""Wacky Races,"" ""Dastardly & Muttley"" still possessed the audacity to try to be funny in the old-fashioned cartoon sense, and not script-driven teenage sleuth shows that would follow (D&M went straight from outline to storyboard). TV budgets that Hanna-Barbera worked with certainly wouldn't allow D&M to be as funny as classic WB cartoons, but it would be unfair to compare it unfavorably to them. It harkens back to a time way before grossouts, toilet humor and double entendres became cartoon standards.",1168300800,5,782,5.165354330708661

2231621,4,B0007QS31A,"Fasten your seatbelts and prepare for take off! Strap yourself in and fly along with Dick Dastardly and the vulture squadron in this classic Hanna Barbera spin-off. Join Dick Dastardly and his hilarious canine sidekick Muttley as they try to stop Yankee Doodle Pigeon from delivering his message. This wonderful 3 single sided disc set contains all 17 episodes from the show plus bonus features as well as a replica collectible animation cell suitable for framing.

The video transfer quality is really good and better than I expected, considering the show was made in 1969. The sound is in Dolby Digital 2.0 and I've noticed it's louder in some segments than others, but it's not a big deal. All the characters are voiced by two actors Paul Winchell and Don Messick and once again they're great. The disc packaging and disc artwork are comparable to the other Hanna Barbera sets released and in my opinion the set is well done. Overall the quality is very good and I'm happy to add this Hanna Barbera classic to my expanding animation collection. Join Dick Dastardly, Muttley and Klunk as they try to stop Yankee Doodle Pigeon once and for all.

Your mission should you buy this set is to, Stop That Pigeon!

2231622,4,B0007QS31A,"Dastardly and Muttley crash into your TV screen once again in this DVD set, the second offspring of Hanna-Barbera's much-loved WACKY RACES.  The triptych of WACKY RACES, DASTARDLY AND MUTTLEY IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES and THE PERILS OF PENELOPE PITSTOP were heralds of Hanna-Barbera's return to zany slapstick comedy in the Sixties.

This show began life as STOP THAT PIGEON, a series about a kooky flying squadron whose mission is to stop a carrier pigeon.  Dastardly and Muttley were brought into this series due to their popularity from WACKY RACES, and the final product makes it easy to see why this villainous duo command such a loyal fan base.  Although Dastardly and Muttley are not particularly nice people, one gets the sense that they are not really evil either: as the designated Bad Guys of WACKY RACES, D&M cheated, plotted, schemed, double-crossed and booby-trapped simply because it was their job.

Dick Dastardly (voiced by Paul Winchell, one of only two voices for every character in this series) is now the commander of a World-War-I-era flying force known as the Vulture Squadron, consisting of Muttley (growled, snickered and cursed by Don Messick), whose job in this series is mainly to rescue Dastardly from crashing to the ground (though not without the promise of a medal), maniacal inventor Klunk, who dreams up and builds various absurd-looking planes and speaks in sound effects, and craven coward Zilly, who translates for Klunk and tries repeatedly to sneak off at crucial points (such as the beginning of a flight).  Their mission, ordered by an unseen General, is to catch the fearless patriotic flyer Yankee Doodle Pigeon (who, compared to his colorful enemies, seems rather boring). Meager though this premise is by today's standards of cartoons, it launched literally hundreds of deranged schemes and crazed inventions that ended in disaster.  Those who decry the predictable outcomes are missing the point: the fun of this cartoon is not derived from watching the Vulture Squadron screw up, but watching HOW they do it.

The planes, designed by animator Jerry Eisenberg (who provides commentary on one episode and insights into the origins of D&MITFM on a featurette in this set), are practically Goldbergian in scope, and become more complicated, outrageous and even surrealistic as each episode progresses.  If there is such a thing as a triumph of inefficiency, these creations nail it again and again.

The cartoons are relatively good transfers, with each episode consisting of two D&M cartoons, ""Wing Dings"" or various vaudeville-type gags featuring the characters, and ""Magnificent Muttley,"" showcasing Dastardly's disloyal companion in a sort of Walter-Mitty role, imagining himself as a hero getting the best of his villainous partner in various situations, places, and times.  Two featurettes are also included, showcasing ""the Vulture Squadron's Greatest Misses"" and the origins of the series (which, incidentally, is also on the WACKY RACES DVD set, along with the Penelope Pitstop featurette).  Each episode seems to be as aired, though the music in ""Wing Dings"" occasionally seems mixed louder than the dialogue.

This is a nice set, and a good companion piece to the WR and PENELOPE PITSTOP sets if you have them.  Nab it, tab it, grab it and ram it into the DVD player for a wild cartoon flight... especially since it's much easier to catch than Yankee Doodle Pigeon.",1146441600,32,3418,5.157323688969258

Together with the cowardly Zilly & the unintelligible Klunk & his wacky inventions, they try to STOP THE PIGEON! TRIVIA: Only TWO PEOPLE did the voices for this cartoon! Paul Winchel & Don Messick",1115856000,8,341,4.796610169491525
2231625,4,B0007QS31A,"This classic cartoon, commonly known as ""Stop That Pigeon"" among young viewers over the years, first debuted on September 13, 1969 on CBS and subsequently aired on and off in syndication over the years.  I first saw the series growing up in the 80s.

The stars of the series are Dick Dastardly and his snickering canine sidekick Muttley (who always muttered his signature ""rassuh-frazza-pazza).  The duo was first introduced in 1968 as part of the ensemble cast of Wacky Races (which received a similar dvd treatment from Warner Bros. Home Video last year).  Along with the rest of the Vulture Squadron (fellow dimwitted pilots Zilly and Klunk), they use WWI aircraft in an attempt to follow the orders of ""The General.""  Those orders being: STOP THAT PIGEON!

The show is somewhat reminiscent of Road Runner, with the Vulture Squadron filling the Wile E. Coyote role.  The outcome is similar too, with Dastardly and co. failing spectacularly in each episode to stop the pigeon.

Dastardly's voice, and that of The General, were done by Paul Winchell, whose other roles include Winnie the Pooh's friend Tigger, Zummi Gummi and Marmaduke. The legendary Don Messick (famous for his work as the voice of Scooby-Doo), did Muttley as well as the other members of The Vulture Squadron.

The half-hour show originally consisted of two Dastardly/Muttley adventures, a brief segment in which Muttley daydreamed about adventures of his own, and a few quick, unrelated gags. All 17 episodes are included in this set.

Bonus features on the DVD include:

Coyote in the ""Road Runner"" cartoons, it is because master cartoon gag writer Michael Maltese wrote for both Hanna-Barbera and Warner Brothers and worked on both cartoon series.  He had the touch.

Paul Winchell (Dick Dastardly and The General) and Don Messick (Muttley, Klunk, Zilly, and Yankee Doodle Pigeon) comprised the entire voice cast for the half hour D&M series as a testament to their voice acting versatility.  Dick Dastardly's suffering the brunt of the cartoon violence was the main comedy....and Muttley's snickering after witnessing said violence was the exclamation point!

2231706,5,B0007QS31A,"Fresh from Wacky Races, Dick Dastardly and his dog, Muttley are now taking to the skies. Their mission, to stop Yankee Doodle Pigeon from delivering his messages. With cowardly Zilly and incomprehensible-but-inventive Klunk in tow, one would think this mission's in the bag, right? Wrong. Watch as Dastardly and his Vulture Squadron concoct elaborate planes and plans to 'Stop that pigeon' and fail with disastrous, yet hilarious results.

With this as the premise of 'Dastardly and Muttley in their Flying Machines,' Hanna-Barbara continues the simple formula of basic plot (the Vulture Squadron's attempts to stop the pigeon and failing), slapstick gags in self-contained episodes. Added to the mix are side stories and gags in the form of ""Wing-dings,"" self-contained shorts of gags and jokes, and ""Magnificent Muttley,"" a series of companion shorts that focuses on Muttley daydreaming he's a hero, getting the better of Dastardly.

The quality of the episodes are clean and crisp. The dvd menu has a funny little sideshow of the Vulture Squadron chasing the pigeon back and forth. There are are number of bonus features including:

The Vulture Squadron's Greatest Misses: A series of highlight reels of the squadron members in their more hilarious blunders, quips and epic fails to catch Yankee Doodle Pigeon.

Dastardly & Muttley Spinoffs: What Wacky Races Wrought: A retrospective with animation veterans Iwa Takamoto and Jerry Eisenberg(designers for this series) and Scott Jeralds (of Warner Bros.

2231732,4,B0007QS31A,"Brings back memories of my childhood when my only worry was getting that second  bowl of Sugar Frosted Flakes  . I loved the cartoon  then, and I love it still.  I can't help but  laugh when Don Messick does the famous Muttley wheezy snicker . Also amazing to think that he and the great Paul "" Tigger Mahoney "" Winchell were the only voices in the cartoon .
Maybe I am an old fart , but I think the H-B cartoons are still the best
compared even to today's computer  generated shows.",1184889600,12,483,4.195652173913044
2231733,5,B0007QS31A,"""Don't expect a medal for catching me on the bounce"" - I laughed until I was crying!

This show is funnier watching it as an adult than it was when I was a kid.  And my kids (7 and 5) think they're great too.

Buy it - you will not be disappointed.",1182816000,2,248,3.730769230769231
