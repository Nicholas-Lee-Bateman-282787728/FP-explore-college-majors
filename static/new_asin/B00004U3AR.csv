8363478,4,B00004U3AR,"Keeping in line with the tradition of other low-budget, cheesy horror films, Nuke 'Em High leaves the viewer satisfied that he or she has successfully wasted two full hours of their life with nothing to show for it.
The movie begins when an overweight manager at a nuclear powerplant attempts to cover up a radioactive spill that contaminates the local water supply. Nuke 'Em High, a highschool located near the plant begins to show the effects of the spill. The preppy kids become mutant degenerants reminicsent of Mad Max. They terrorize all of the other kids and faculty and also begin selling contaminated weed from the power plant to other kids at school. This inadvertantly creates an angry, superhuman jock who spits acid and begins to seek revenge on the mutants. After that scene I sort of lost track of what was going on in the movie. Either I was too intoxicated or too distracted to pay close attention to the plot. The brilliance of this movie is that you don't need to pay close attention to still understand what is going on. In fact I would reccomend not trying to follow the story since it would probably only cause further confusion and frustration.
The ending was great and there was, of course, some good nudity scenes as well. I would highly reccomend this movie to anyone who appreciates this sort of genre or just wants to see a mindless, gory movie.",1000252800,2,1373,4.677685950413223
