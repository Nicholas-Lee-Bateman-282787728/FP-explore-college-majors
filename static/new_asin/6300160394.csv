3520250,5,6300160394,"I bought this video back in 1989 for a niece, who loved it and watched it repeatedly.  It has since been passed around to each new baby in the family.  In ten years, not one baby, boy or girl, hasn't been captavated  and entertained by this wonderful tape.  It is now back at our house and my  15 month old son loves it.  Nothing else has held his attention like this.  It's really a must have!",942969600,13,394,4.105263157894737

8290050,5,6300160394,My daughter was excited when she received this for Christmas.  She loved it as a child and loves it still today.  I hope she'll share it with her kids someday.,1360022400,,159,4.266666666666667

8290052,5,6300160394,"Bought my first ""More Baby Songs"" when my now 25 yo son was a toddler.  Both my kids loved it.  When my granddaughter came along, I played it for her ... and it is once again a hit!  Wish I could find the original More Baby Songs on DVD. There is a DVD version, but it is not the same as the original.  The original version includes ""Crazy Monster"" and ""Watch a Witchy Whiz"" -- both favorites and would not want to replace them.  So we bought a 2nd original VHS copy (ours was looking pretty tattered) as a backup and will keep at least one VHS player available just for this.  It's worth it!",1323475200,,592,4.104347826086957
8290053,3,6300160394,"Years ago, I purchased 5 Baby Songs videos for granddaughter #1.  She loved them all.  When granddaughter #2 began watching them, she immediately loved them.  Recently I checked to see if we owned all that were available and I found More Baby Songs.  I bought it for her but it was quite disappointing considering what we had come to expect from Baby Songs.  Primarily, the monsters bother her.  I wonder why monsters were ever included in a video for young toddlers?",1320624000,,467,4.703703703703703
8290054,5,6300160394,"i used to watch these videos when i was a little girl and i could never get over them...now 17 years later i have gone back searching for all the baby songs videos,but just the classics. ""more baby songs"" and ""baby blues"" i believe are the best... for all mother's of toddler's these help your kids  grow and learn through singing and dancing and even acting...u will not regret it.i know i didn't!",1185235200,,398,4.4520547945205475
8290055,5,6300160394,"This is an excellent video for children.  While not traditional songs, it introduces children to different words and rhythms.  The child, though ""Family Harmony"" learns the names of all the instruments.  I was a little concerned about the witch and monster songs, but I preview all videos and then watch them with the children.  Those songs didn't turn out to be a problem.  We talk about the songs and the characters, which is what we did with ""Sitting In A High Chair"".  We talk about the naughty monkey and how we don't throw food.  Even an 18 mo old can understand that.  Our almost 2 yr old granddaughter asks for these songs by name and loves watching them.  I find myself singing the songs too.  Highly recommend!",1138752000,,720,4.5984251968503935
8290056,3,6300160394,"I love baby song original, and 'more baby songs' is still more of the good stuff. What let's it down for me  is the 'monster' and 'Witch' songs. I don't like the scary songs for little children. Keep the good, bin the bad.",1018828800,2,222,4.162790697674419
