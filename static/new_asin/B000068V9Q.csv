1730263,5,B000068V9Q,"My two-year-old was a Thomas the Tank Engine fanatic, and I was bored silly and wanted to get him to watch something else. I bought this video, and Thomas is now forgotten. At least 10 times a day my son asks for ""Bob bob bob"" (though I don't indulge him every time he asks!). The videos are fun, the characters are funny, and they sneak in a little educational stuff too.",1084233600,5,372,4.253521126760563

1730337,5,B000068V9Q,"Thia video is very educational and teaches team work, cooperation and friendship is a very gentle and interesting way. Quite a breath of fresh air from our kid's old favorite ""Thomas the Train"" that has a lot of angry attitudes. Highly recommend it as a gift for a 2-5 year old.",1166227200,,278,4.470588235294118
1730338,5,B000068V9Q,"When I need to keep my little one busy, BOY OH BOY...can Bob do it?  Yes, he can.  It's amazing how much my son enjoys the video, sings the theme song & plays with his trucks right along with it.  I approve of the content, I appreciate the clear use of language (my son is speech delayed) and the interaction with others. I was very happy with this purchase and with other Bob the Builder videos.",1128816000,3,396,4.184210526315789
1730339,5,B000068V9Q,"This BBC children's show featuring ""stop-motion claymation"" animation has been voiced over for US audiences. ""Constructive"" and enjoyable, with plenty of great, engaging characters.  It's my 2-year-old son's favorite show after ""Blue's Clues"" and ""Kipper.""  For adults, it's fun to hunt for the UK references - coats of arms, European road signs, etc.  Trivia Note: According to its distributors, ""Bob the Builder"" is also the #1 preschool show in Germany, Japan, and Australia.",1111104000,4,478,5.52054794520548
1730340,5,B000068V9Q,"Bob the Builder: Bob Saves the Day is a great addition to the library of children's dvds and videos that we have begun to collect (and slowly drown in, lol!).  This is maybe four episodes' worth of Bob the Builder and his adventures during a day hard at work.  The cheery contractor and his talking machines always show respect and care for each other, but then watch as they use their construction savvy to help even the little animals. They rescue birds, mice, etc. from various predicaments.

As usual, Bob and the gang manage to get the job done through teamwork, all the while showing pride in their workmanship.  I think this installment --as well as the entire series --sends valuable messages to kids about the importance of hard work and cooperation. You could tell kids about these ideas until you are blue in the face but they'll identify even better with the trucks and tractors in this delightful show.  You just can't miss with Bob!

And now a word to the producers:  While I can appreciate that you had to change a few things for the American audience, it was not necessary to change what was obviously a family of hedgehogs into ""porcupines"".  Kids aren't dumb - in fact, they usually learn much faster than adults.  You do a disservice to them by ""dumbing down"" the vocabulary.  But that was really a very minor quibble and I still heartily recommend Bob and friends to all parents of toddlers.

7965073,4,B000068V9Q,"As an adult, it's atrocious. Why do they talk? Why don't the ""humans"" ride in the vehicles? So many, many, questions. My child loves it! They cannot get enough of it. So, if you need a few minutes without a toddler clinging to you put this on and they'll be preoccupied for a while.",1481500800,,282,4.2407407407407405
