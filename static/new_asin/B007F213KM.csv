5080309,5,B007F213KM,I'm always tempted by the various Something Weird DVD's. I can't afford all of them. I wish I could! I HAVE bought Monsters Crash the Pajama Party (!) and Kiss Me Quick. Great stuff. It's wonderful that somebody is SAVING this priceless trash. This sampler is nice way to get a dose of this infectious stew. And the price is RIGHT.,1065916800,3,331,4.442622950819672

5080311,3,B007F213KM,"Ok, at first glance, I understood this to be a ""sampler"" of strange films.  It is just that.  It's basically trailors of strange films, grindhouse classics, and classic horror films that I have in my collection presently.  If the return time hadn't already expired by the time I viewed this DVD, I would have returned it quickly!  It wasn't even worth the $6.00 that I paid for it.  But if you are looking to pass the time away, with absolutely nothing else to watch, then here you go.  I will say this, the DVD did draw my attention to other films that I never seen before, and would like in my collection like grindhouse classics, as well as other classic horrors, however, I was very turned off my the rape clips.  It was a let down to say the least.  Definitely something wierd, and I don't know what to do with it now. I guess I can give it to someone.",1288656000,,857,4.279503105590062

5080316,5,B007F213KM,"A few weeks ago, I bought a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/42nd-Street-Forever-Vol-1/dp/B000BLI5PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">42nd Street Forever, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;and reviewed  it on amazon. You see I loved drive_in movies. I rememeber watching some of the best of the worst  at the Laurel drive in in the 70's and 80's. It was a special era that will never come again.

A friend who read my review suggested I pick up this dvd collection.  He said it was a better collection than 42nd Street. So I ordered it. It is more of the grindhouse film with a stronger T & A action films. DAMN he was RIGHT! I may never hear the end of this

These trailers are a drive-in movie  fans's  dream. Know some of these are in color, most in glorious Black & White. It still is fun to watch!

Many trailers are the schlock B shock horror films I grew up on. There are a lot in this collection.  Films  like Blood Feast and Wizard of Gore&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizard-Of-Gore-Special-Edition/dp/B00004S89C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizard Of Gore (Special Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Feast/dp/B00004KDER/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Feast</a>&nbsp;are showcased here.

 Also there are stripper film trailers that seem to have been sold for Stag parties of the 1950's and 1960's. A few have such strippers like Blaze Starr, Tempest Storm and Bette Page. Fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notorious-Bettie-Page/dp/B000GB5M42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notorious Bettie Page</a>&nbsp;will love these trailers of Page.

Something Weird Video is the DVD capital of schlock videos on DVD. These  over 8o trailers are not really star ladden movie trailers (well there is one trailer--The Veil  with Boris Karloff!). but if you are a fan of drive-in cinema, grindhouse films or schlock SF, this collection is for you. I will say this, these trailers are on very clean masters. Each trailer can be viewed separately, It does have a nice DVD transfer

The one thing that is missing is the Kung fu, chop socky films of the 1970...well that can be on another collection

These films trailers are not for kids...There are NO DISNEY FILMS here, unless you think the Erotic Adventures of Zorro is for children (IT ISNT!). However It is filled with many nude actors and actreees doing soft porn, monsters, buckets of gore...and VERY BAD ACTING!

As I watched this DVD, I had only one thought in my mind. ""GAWD, I wish there was a drive-in playing some of these films tonight""

5080317,2,B007F213KM,"If this is the best sampler of what Something Weird Video has to offer, they must have a very tame concept of ""weird."" Plus it doesn't make much sense to advertise ""over 100 movies"" and have the selection menu very clearly end BEFORE 100; you don't even have to count 'em to find the false advertising.

I know that these have a much different appeal to me as a modern day viewer. I often laughed at the absurdity of the content. But I really enjoyed myself as I watched them! That's the important part. Especially when your investment is all of five bucks.",1187049600,3,482,4.604651162790698

There's plenty of fake blood and real nudity - so watch out if you are sensitive to such things.  Otherwise, these film trailers are so bad that they defy explaination...it's one of those things you have to see for yourself.

What is truly amazing to me is: how was Hollywood able to 'change' all in one day, from harmless 60's beach movies to incredible gore and complete nudity.  You can see the evolution (or perhaps 'revolution') by watching this sampler.

The best thing under $6 you will ever buy at Amazon.com!",1120003200,4,613,4.5181818181818185
5080321,1,B007F213KM,"This would have been a great disc, but all the trailers are ruined by the presence of ""SWV"" in the bottom-right in blockly letters.  My eyes hurt after watching the entire thing in one sitting, then I broke the disc and gouged my eyes out with it.

I've got a few other Something Weird discs that include some trailers and other neat stuff, but those too are ruined in the same way.  The main movies on the discs are presented clean, but I still can't support a company that does this.  Broadcast TV has become unwatchable in the same way, do we really want to tell home video companies that this practice is acceptable?

Shame on Image for agreeing to distribute material that is desecrated in this manner.",1112227200,21,707,4.4921875
5080322,5,B007F213KM,"Stumbling upon this masterpiece, hidden beneath the Bargain Display at the local Best Buy, is for me the cinematic equivalent of discovering King Tut's Tomb and The Dead Sea Scrolls - combined.

Outstanding entries include ""Goliath and The Dragon"", ""Godmonster of Indian Flats"" and ""The Erotic Adventures of Zorro.""

Sure, you could spend a fortune at NYU studying film appreciation or you could just plunk down a few bucks for this DVD and receive a truly uncensored education.",1111276800,10,478,5.115384615384615
5080323,5,B007F213KM,"If you are a fan of B-Movies, or just want to become a bit more familiar with the genre, this DVD is an absolute steal! I bought this ""Something Weird Sampler"" because of the low price, but my expectations were not high. I say with a grin ""How wrong I was!""
A combination of theater trailers and 5-10 minutes snipets of flicks, The Sampler is an absolute video feast. What makes this budget buy so valuable is that a good portion of these films are unwatchable as full length films, but a sampling of the film or its trailer is priceless.
A few of the films like ""Confessions of a Psycho-Cat"" and ""Swamp Girl"" are low budget gems I enjoy on their entirety. The trailers for both these movies are included, and are every bit as awesome as the films themselves (by the way, the man being gored to death by the ""Lady Matador Psycho-Cat"" is none other than Jake LaMotta!).
And if you are one of those fans of 1960s nudie & cheesecake movies, this trailer compilation has nudity galore in  many of these previews, including ""Wham-Bam Thank You Spaceman,"" ""Nude on the Moon,"" and ""Kiss Me Quick.""
Other truly hep trailers include ""Kidnapped Co-Ed,"" ""Two Thousand Maniacs,"" ""Mantis In Lace"" (late 1960s classic about a stripper who, under the influence of LSD, becomes a killing machine!), ""Johnny Firecloud,"" ""For The Hell Of It,"" and LOTS MORE!
I truly hope there is a sequel to this Sampler. It would be great to see other trailers and samplings that Something Weird Video does have in their library like ""Pot, Parents and Police,"" ""The Psychedelic Priest,"" and ""The Adventures of Lucky Pierre.""",1090108800,66,1591,4.661921708185053
5080324,4,B007F213KM,"This is a collection of trailers from Something Weird, and they really are something weird. Of course all these movies are fiction, but it is hard to believe the truth that any of these were actually made. The subjects vary, but generally run in the Joe Bob Briggs genre. I thought these were mostly tremendously amusing, although I think a few of them are in inexcusably bad taste (and here I am thinking of the entire Herschell Gordon Lewis catalog), which is why I am only giving this four stars.
Most of the trailers are independently hilarious, particularly the trailer for ""Kiss Me Quick"", which I haven't seen, but plan to, as it looks intoxicatingly bad. Also noteworthy are the trailers for the Chesty Morgan movies, which must be seen to be believed. You may also spot some movies that became MST3K episodes (""Horrors of Spider Island"", anyone?)
Overall this is a good package which lost its star for excess tasteless slasher movie trailers. I realize that those are grade-Z movies, but they seem a bit over represented here. This DVD will appeal to anyone who likes to laugh at preposterously poorly made movies, and the price can't be beat.",1090022400,3,1152,4.765

They're worse than the worst I've ever seen, which is Dwayne Esper's Maniac!  At least they look like the worst, although trailers usually contain the best a movie has to offer.

5080326,4,B007F213KM,"Do you like movie trailers?  I sure do...do you like sick, twisted,  disgusting, depraved, twisted sleezefest-o-ramas with lots of gratuitous nudity covered in buckets of blood?  I sure...don't...but never mind that.  Image entertainment and Something Weird Video (SWV) bring us over 100 trailers from some of the sleaziest movies ever made.  And for under five bucks!

Basically this is sort of an advertisement for SWV to showcase all the films (cough, cough) they've released onto DVD.  Some of the highlights (or lowlights, depending on your point of view) are Two Thousand Maniacs (1964), House on Bare Mountain (1962), Basket Case (1982), The Mighty Gorga (1969), Johnny Firecloud (1975), The Gore, Gore Girls (1972), Deadly Weapons (1973), Fiend of Dope Island (1961), The Curious Dr. Humpp (1971), and Blood Feast (1963).  Believe me, these are some of the most truly awful exploitation movies ever made, but at least I was able to preview them here instead of blindly buying them individually at a much higher price.

The DVD does provide an alphabetical listing and chapter stops for each movie trailer, so you have the option to choose to only watch the ones you want or you can choose to have them play one after another and watch them all nonstop.  I was only able to view a small quantity at a time, as some got pretty revolting.  The one thing I didn't like about this presentation was Something Weird Video decided they needed to put the letters 'SWV' on the bottom, right hand corner of the screen throughout, I suppose as a means to protect their property.  It became a bit annoying, even though they obviously tried to make it unobtrusive by 'blending' the logo in a little, making the letters semi-transparent.  Do they do this on their individual releases of movies on DVD?  I hope not...

I do own many of these trailers on a couple of Sinister Cinema VHS releases, and I was slightly disappointed in that SWV didn't include some nifty theater spots that are included on the Sinister Cinema videos between some of the trailers, like that one that has dancing concession food singing to you to go to the lobby and buy delicious hot dogs, popcorn, sodas and various candies.  That would have made this over the top for me.  Other than that, this was a lot of fun, but avoid this disc if you have a weak stomach or an aversion to seeing a whole lot of flabby nekkid women.

Every aspect and timeframe of grindhouse cinema is in here from roughies to spoof porn.  All I have to say is that I hope S.W. does another one of those real soon.

While my best friend was working in the music section at Borders Books and Music.  They were given several boxes full of copies of this DVD, and instructed to give a free copy out with any music or movie purchase.

It wasn't long before upset old people and parents of under-aged teens and kids came in totally raging mad because of all of the violence and nudity on here.
In other words... Borders accidentally gave softcore porn out to a bunch of minors and old people for free.

He was instructed to throw away any copies the store had left.  So he took home a box of them and handed them out to all of his friends.

On a serious note.
These trailers are all hilariously terrible and entertaining.

Having been a fan of this type of genre, I found it odd that I have only seen a half dozen or so of these movies. Perhaps, it is because when they first came out they only played in theaters for one week before another ""gem"" came to town. The trailers include the scare warnings, ""Don't look if you are squeamish""  and ""take your children to the lobby"" in the age before ratings.

Early exploitation films of the 1950's boast of being filmed in Eastman color. Some of the movie trailers were extremely comical as the monsters they used were so fake looking, one would wonder why they even bothered to make the film. Some of the movies look like low budget versions of later films, or perhaps they were rip offs. I couldn't help think about ""King Kong vs Godzilla"" when I saw the ape battling T. Rex in ""The Mighty Gorga.""

The movie trailers are shown alphabetically, skipping some titles on the list. Then it returns and shows the titles it skips. There is nudity, some full frontal as well as simulated sex and rape. Some of the nudity was 1950's style which always had a leg strategically placed. Some of the trailers were their own plot spoilers as they show the main character getting killed.
