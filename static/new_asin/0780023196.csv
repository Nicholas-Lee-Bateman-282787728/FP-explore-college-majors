30694,5,0780023196,"This movie defies any easy description of it. What makes it so great is the way it transcends the confines of normal film narrative. And Pink Floyd does deserve a lot credit for that transcendant feel. The cinematographer and the great locations also have a lot to do with the feel of this picture. The actual plot is somewhat pedestrian. Two youths dropping out further and further. Both however are played by very appealing actors and Mimsy Farmer is especially interesting. She plays her role with a cool and naturalness making her seem like the very incarnation of the sixties spirit both the creative and destructive side of it. The male lead has less star appeal but he is solid. Its her movie though. Hers and the blue seas, and the soundtrack. Barbet Schroeder is not serving any script, rather he is capturing a mood, the story is incidental to the music.",1022976000,18,864,4.690789473684211

Against his friends warning, Stefan falls for Estelle, but doesn't find out until later that she has been addicted to heroin. Stefan soon gives into temptation and trys the dangerous drug. But, basically he just wants to be loved by Estelle, you'll find out for yourself if the needle brings them closer or not. I have to say that the music in this film, all by Pink Floyd fits the atmosphere tremendously, and flows with the movie. This film is NOT in the vein as other traditional ""drug adiction films"". MORE stands alone! Great photography too of the in's and out's of Europe.",1016755200,3,638,4.654867256637168
30696,5,0780023196,"I first heard of this film in 1984 when I first started to get into Pink Floyd. The soundtrack album, though still one of my favorites, seemed to be an echo of something bigger, yet out of reach. Because of this, the film (to me, anyway) was something I had to be in search of. I found a copy at Lechmere in the mid 90's and was psyched. Almost a 'music video' to the soundtrack album, it aslo features songs not heard on the soundtrack album (most notably the never-released ""Seabirds"") and some cuts with different mixes (like ""Cymbaline"" with Waters on lead vocals).
For these reasons alone, the film is a must for any avid Floyd fan. Apart from that, I've seen very few films that document the free-spiritedness of the era. Made in 1969 and set in the same present, it chronicles Stephan - a German math student's travels through Europe, where he meets Estelle, an American Heroin user.
Soon Stephan is using everyday and quickly becomes addicted. You'll have to watch it to find out what happens to Stephan, I won't spoil it here. Suffice it to say that this is one of the bleakest, darkest and most truthful depictions of hard drug addiction. The letterbox version offers little more landscape than the original home video release, but it does have a really cool trailer (in french) at the end. Also the original release had no subtitles and the widescreen version does (""...so THAT's what they were saying""). All in all it's a great film but much better if you are an avid Pink Floyd fan.
If you love Floyd, this film is a MUST!
If you love heroin, this film may change your view.
Either way, you'll have some kind of reaction.",1000166400,28,1634,4.523648648648648
30697,5,0780023196,"Dont listen to the naysayers below, MORE is a fantastic example of 60s counterculture cinema. The main reason, of course, is the classic soundtrack music by Pink Floyd (possibly their most underrated and overlooked album), but the film has a cool, laid-back late 60s European attitude that is very appropriate for the subject matter. The Paris scenes are great, but the real magic of the film happens on the island of Ibiza (where Nico would die in a bicycle fall during the 80s). It's a magical place that gives the cinematography of the film (by Nestor Alamendros) an almost mystical look at times. The German actor Klaus Grunberg plays the naive hero, Stefan, with a slightly campish quality that makes him rather endearing. And, of course, Mimsy Farmer is great to look at, especially in the many nude scenes that were edited out of the original 1969 American release. The 2000 rerelease of the film is fantastic, a beautifully remastered print with great sound, and letterboxed too! Light the sacred herb, and let the film draw you in slowly. It might take a couple of viewings to appreciate its more subtle points, but for Pink Floyd fans (and for Barbet Schroeder fans), this and it's companion film, LA VALLEE, are essential to your collections. And for $... each, how can you go wrong? FIVE STARS one of my alltime faves! check it out :)",998697600,13,1346,4.756410256410256

The problem is that none of that made  the movie interesting.  Almost all of the character scenes were plain  straight on shots.  Even the dramatic landscapes that comprise much of the  films setting seem muted by the lack of life and genuine emotion from the  actors. The Monkees TV show had better camera work.

30758,4,0780023196,"Most fishing videos on the market are pretty basic - find structure... find fish, and this one is no exception.  It takes you fishing with several different people and the scenery is pretty nice.  You get to see these guys catch lots of fish.  If you've ever been crappie fishing, you already know that the color lure you use can make a difference.  That, too, is basic on this video; however, what I disliked is that you don't get to see the difference in action.  Everybody is always catching fish and nobody is sitting around not catching anything and then suddenly they change something and bang, now they are getting hits.  I also would like to have seen more on the use of fish finders to locate crappie hideouts.  I enjoyed watching the video and seeing some folks talk about running the dozers that created the reservoirs.  That's the reason I gave it 4 stars.  Just didn't learn much from it.

The tension is between the idealism of a young, nave guy and the manipulation of the girl he idealizes -- who is in turn a slave of addiction.  The 60s Euro drug culture is the empty soul of this film that is so beautifully photographed by Nestor Almendros.  It is a product of its time as well as a timely warning about heading off to paradise and shooting up.

30770,5,0780023196,"In 1969, ""More"" prompted many young urbanites to move to Ibiza, to live the utopian dream. The Pink Floyd is a favorite among the expatriate veterans who still live on the island. English is the proper language for this movie, for, not only it facilitated its commercialization, but actually is the lingua franca among these expressive expatriates.

Though a tad disappointing as a movie production, ""More"" historically embodies the Spirit of a time. The acting is quite ludicrous at the beginning, but it gradually improves, as the narrative unfolds and the actors get into their roles. In any case, More is definitely a cult of the counterculture, thematizing the challenges and shortcomings of transpersonal utopia. Reflecting the anti-heroine stance (drug which ultimately throws hippies down from bliss to destruction), the movie resonates with autobiographies, such as Cleo Odzer's ""Goa Freaks"", and it can be better understood by the anthropological book by Anthony D'Andrea, ""Global Nomads"" about Ibiza and Goa/India.

If you experienced the counterculture, and/or were in Ibiza (its alternative world, not tourism...), or like chaotic romances in exotic yet real situations, then you will love the movie.

I can understand that the movie can be boaring and seems to be unprofessional,famous only because of the Pink Floyd music.
Some dialoges are really out of time and the timing: ok its the late 60s! See ""man who fell to earth"" or ""rosemarys baby""Movies were slower at this time.
But I want to tell something about the place Ibiza. As I live here for 5 years(I`m german,not spanish)I think,I can say,that there is another way of feeling this movie knowing this very special place. From the late 60s to now Ibiza has a ""strange atraction"" to people,who want to change their life. Esoterical interested,drugusers,drop outs,for them Ibiza is a dream. Matter of fact we call it ""Magic island"" and speak about the ""Spirit of Ibiza"".Now the old hippie lifestyle has changed,but every summer the best DJs offer us high quality settings in techno and house(Sven Vth,Carl Cox,John Acquaviva etc)
So Ibiza is really what you see in the movie and the movie let me with a very strange bad feeling,because for this german guy the dream broke and the bad power of heroin won at least.
We have not so many heroin problems here,as one could think,but it is really amazing,that a place,which can give pure pleasure without taking any drugs has a big drug market.
To see ""More"" as a portrait from Ibiza is a way to understand it,a broken dream for some of us,but see also the beautines.
By the way,I didn`t like the way,the germans were presented,cause at this time the neonazi or old nazi problems were not as obvious and no woman or girl would bear the way this german macho treated her longer than 5 minutes.
I liked the movie because it made an echoe in my soul for some days,not a good feeling,but better than no feeling.
And its a portrait of a time.

The Veggie portion was great as always. The comedy between Bob and Larry is the funniest. I must admit though, I never heard of Twippo until I watched the video. My 3 yr old loved it! She is now saying,""Mommy, I want to watch my new Veggie."" We cannot wait until we get to see the movie.",1030924800,,459,4.287356321839081
30802,1,0780023196,"I'm sorry.  This movie has to rate as one of the worst movies ever made.  I picked it up for the Pink Floyd score, of course.  I knew I was in trouble from the opening credits;  ""Music by The Pink Floyd"".  Roger, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Pink Floyd was ever known as ""The"" Pink Floyd.
  I give one star and that is only for the music.  There are actually a few interesting musical elements that don't show up on the soundtrack.  And what happened to ""Cirrus Minor"".  I certainly hope the song wasn't cut to make room for more dreadful acting or laughable dialogue.  There was plenty of that to go around.",1030665600,7,622,4.230769230769231
30803,5,0780023196,"I chose to buy this video because I can't wait to take my girls to see the movie, ""Jonah - a VeggieTales Movie,"" which opens in theaters on October 4th, 2002!!  I wanted to catch a glimpse of what was to come, for myself, but more importantly, for my two daughters, whom I have never taken into a movie theater. (I think Disney movies are too scary and sad, but anywhooo...) I also thought it would be great to know some of the new Veggie songs *before* seeing the movie, to help my girls feel more comfortable with the newness of the whole theater experience.
As for the new songs, I have to say the ones chosen for this video are *AWESOME*!  My kids crack up over the ""Billy Jo McGuffrey"" tune!  During the song, the video footage shows some real-life kids, acting out the silly words on a school stage.  It's really cute, and very funny!  I have recently ordered the cd, so we can sing this in the car!  The ""Belly of a Whale"" song is by far, my favorite, maybe because the footage is similar to a music video, in that the ""real"" group is seen performing, in between scenes from the movie. A re-mix of the older, ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"" is positively hilarious!  The Veggie pirates are seen on the deck of a pirate ship, just hanging around in their rock-a-loungers.  I just about choked on my diet Coke watching that for the first time...so a warning to you diet Coke drinkers! :)
The only drawback I can think of, to be fair, is that the video is too short for my liking.  I WANT too much of a GOOD thing!! :) Anyway, we have watched it several times in a row, just to get our fill of the Veggies (and it never gets boring.) Overall, this video is an *AWESOME* 30 minute preview of what's to come in the ""Jonah"" movie!  If you are a Veggie fan...you really ought to get this one!!  And if you are new to the Veggies, this is a great intro to their music, which you probably should become familiar with, anyway...as the Veggies are *coming*!!!

7789400,4,0780023196,"A good story from the late 1960s about relationships falling in love, hippies and drug use. The musical score is good with great early Pink Floyd psychedelic music. The story's protagonist is a handsome German man in his twenties who says that he is particularly interested in mathematics without telling us whether he is a graduate student or some kind of a math teacher. He goes on a prolonged vacation and falls in love with a drug user and eventually becomes addicted to heroine, with that hard drug being his total downfall. One of the morals of the story is just not to mess around with heroine because it can be fatal. The rest of the storyline involves his relationship to an attractive young woman and it's ups and downs. Relationships are often complicated, and therein lies the most interesting part of the movie. The scenery is nice and relaxing, but trouble and complications ensue.",1512172800,,895,4.780645161290322

I'd really like my payment back for this since the link is broken and they are scamming people into buying something they really didn't want.

It was a revelation to finally be able to see it, and it fits in perfectly with other great Barbet Schroeder films like Barfly and Single White Female.

I think it is a classic about drug addiction and the '60s.",1479686400,5,425,4.120481927710843
