8062014,3,B0009JQ380,"This is a typical anthology from SOMETHING WEIRD Video.  It contains:
-- promos for cheesy coming attractions and spook shows
-- various local ads run by merchants for Christmas, or general ""please visit our sponsors"" promos
-- public service films hosted by stars -- John Wayne for a hospital, Eddie Fisher or Gary Cooper for War Bonds, etc
-- several-minutes-long promos for various exploitation road-show films
-- promos for the theatre's or drive-in's snack bar

Most of these are fun or interesting, but THE DOWN SIDE:  Most of this footage is scratched, cut, and jerky.  Hardly any of it is complete without a few feet of footage having been obviously trimmed from the beginning or end.

So if you don't mind watching scratchy multi-generational promos from the 1940s to the 1960s, you will like this show fine.  It will bring back memories of your childhood drive-in or movie-going experiences.",1459468800,,901,5.0134228187919465
