7990918,3,B00009EPB6,"This Rigoletto is a disappointed for any Verdi lover or connaisseur of Rigoletto.  It's probably OK for someone not particularly interested in the actual voice drama.

What I want to praise here is the seller.  No sooner did I express my disappoint with the item, than he immediately wrote me and arranged for a complete refund.

I was unlucky with this DVD, but I would certainly buy from the seller again.",1362096000,3,407,4.690140845070423
7990919,3,B00009EPB6,"This film is an old film, dubbed with English.  Unfortunately, it doesn't contain as much of the music of the opera as I had expected, but what is included is very good.",1361318400,,169,4.28125
7990920,2,B00009EPB6,"Mario Del Monaco and Tito Gobbi do perform in this piece... However,this is a film for those who does not really like opera and out of curiosity, just to find out the story, would not mind to sit down and listen to one or two tiny little pieces of the opera along with it. All the beautiful music of Verdi stays in the background, and all the captivating arias, duettos, etc. are simply left out and even The Quartet! You can forget about it, THERE IS NO QUARTET! just a ""headline"" of it. My 2 stars are not intended to the opera performance, but to the director of the film.",1182556800,15,575,4.236363636363636
7990921,2,B00009EPB6,"This is not close to an opera. We are given only a few arias and snatches of orchestral passages. The story is nearly left to stand on its own as a movie--which it does not do very well. It falls flat. If you have ever--seeing Shakespeare's OTHELLO--felt the need of Verdi's OTELLO music, you will have a similar, but much stronger, feeling here. The voices are excellent--what little we hear of them. Was orchestral sound no better than this in 1946?",1073865600,7,451,4.580246913580247
