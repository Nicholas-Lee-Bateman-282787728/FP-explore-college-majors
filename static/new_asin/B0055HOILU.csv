4578215,3,B0055HOILU,"I agree that the main character in this movie is really vile and unlovable for a good portion of the movie, but for anyone who has ever visited a nursing facility, these characters do really exist.  People get angry and frustrated when they are dependent upon others for their care, and sometimes their polite filters get turned off and they say things that are surprising.  That said, I thought there was real growth and a working through of his issues over the course of the movie.  The caregivers played by Alfre Woodard and LeVar Burton (who also directed the movie) are caring in spite of the unloveliness of some of the patients they have to deal with day in and day out.  The love story between the young roommate and his girlfriend is so moving and eventually the vile old man starts to turn back into a human being as he realizes that he doesn't have it nearly as bad as he thought.  This young man is dying before he really got to live his life.  I spent a good deal of time with my mother in a nursing home the last two years of her life, and while I think the sex talk could have been toned down in this movie, it is not unbelievable, and it certainly made me cry.  There is also hopefulness at the end of the movie.",1319068800,2,1228,4.267241379310345
4578216,1,B0055HOILU,"I am so disappointed with LeVar Burton for creating this film.  I'd come to expect only the best from him over the years.  What this film wants to be is a serious film about dying and living your life to the fullest in the meantime.  The entire film takes place in a hospice facility.  The elderly main character is dying (presumably from cancer).  After his roommate dies, he gets a new one, this time a young man who too is dying from cancer.  The young man's girl friend is a frequent visitor.  It is obvious that they are deeply in love and want to spend what time he has left as fully as possible.  This storyline is inspiring and beautiful.  I only hope I can face death so gracefully.  Unfortunately, this touching storyline cannot triumph over the filth and smut emanating from the language and thoughts of the elderly main character.

This film is disgusting.  The language is filthy and the main character, Alvin, thinks and talks only of sex.  I did not keep a tally, but I would guess that there were at least 10 F-bombs and a couple dozen G-D-I's in this film.  As another reviewer mentioned, when the film begins, there are sexual images on the TV in the hospital room.  There are also graphic talk and gestures about sex throughout the film.  The main character has frequent visits and conversations with a ghost/vision of his late wife, who died young. These conversations often revolve around sex as well, including one particularly graphic conversation concerning their wedding night. When his young roommate's girl friend helps the roommate reattach a tube late at night, this is shown through the drawn hospital room curtain as though it were a sexual act.  When the main character finally decides that it is time to stop feeling sorry for himself and fully live what time he has left, it's just not believable.  He develops an interest in another dying patient, played by Adrienne Barbeau. I'm sure that we are supposed to find the relationship genuine and refreshing, but unfortunately, the relationship seems to be built on Alvin's desire for sex.  For instance, I was hopeful when Alvin acted chivalrous and graciously opened the door of the tub room for Adrienne and her aide to enter.  But Alvin couldn't stop at just being chivalrous, he had to reopen the door to get a peek at naked Adrienne - and so do we.  This is an upper, frontal nude shot of her - granted she was minus a breast due to a mastectomy. The film is unrated but would definitely have been given an R if it had been rated.  As I do not view R-rated movies as a rule, I will not make the mistake of getting an unrated film again.  I wish I would have listened to my better judgement and turned the thing off.  Don't make the same mistake.  Do yourself a favor and do not buy or borrow this film.  Really bad film, LeVar :(",1318377600,,2816,4.526732673267326
4578217,1,B0055HOILU,"I bought this movie with the assumption the story line would lend itself to an enjoyable film.
Was I surprised!!!!!  The film is not rated and should be :  R.

Within the first 5 minutes of the film you were exposed to :
2 elderly men in hospital beds getting bathed by 2 young women,  seemingly teenagers.  The girls dress was not in scrubs.  Instead they had on snug fitting sweaters and very short skirts.
The lead character began to talk about sex and grabbed the one young womans rear.
Then the camera pans the the tv in the room,  where you are exposed to a sex tv ad
 The woman on the tv is dressed in a very tiny bikini that barely covers her very developed body. Then the lead character begins to talk about the woman on the tv and vividly describing her and what he would like to do.  At this point I could not believe the filfthy language. I took out the dvd,  cut it up and threw into the trash.

I would rate this as a tripple 0.

The movie was a deception and should be rated R.....",1316217600,2,996,4.103626943005182
8458332,5,B0055HOILU,"Listen, this film isn't a ""filthy"" film like some have commented. Yes, there is some language and scenes that are suggestive but getting past those, this is a modern day film whose characters are dealing with LIFE as it is, in a stage where there's not much left to do but wait. The main character is cantankerous and often day dreams about the past, so we see current day in his hospital room and then times when he drifts back to have conversations with his wife who is dressed in about late 40s garb. His room mate is a young 20 something who is in even worse shape than he is and whose pretty young wife (Lacey Chaubert) comes to visit. The actors are well known and the scenes beautifully acted. Anyone who has dealt with terminal illness in their family or who've worked in the field will recognize authenticity when they see it. This film is bittersweet but the topic is timeless and Levar Burton depicted it --as it is IS, in the real world. I only hope if any of us face our elder years or a situation like the characters have in the film, that we would be lucky enough to have loving and humane caregivers to help make the journey a little better. I loved Alfre Woodard's character and it was so great to see the beautiful Adrienne Barbeau in this film too. We need more films like this. It was very realistic.",1527379200,,1320,4.348178137651822

for those who are in their  lives. There's alway's hope and thing to look forward to.",1409097600,,296,4.103448275862069

8458338,4,B0055HOILU,"Is it worth an Oscar? No.... An Emmy, maybe. None the less, it is an acceptable film with some very good acting and directing (WTG, LeVar!!) It's also quite sad in spots, but heart-warming in others.",1395878400,,199,4.555555555555555
8458339,5,B0055HOILU,"I could do without the sex talk/visuals, but with that said...this movie was HONEST and beautiful!  The only thing I'd change is that there was no chaplain in the film (as often seems to happen, both in movies and too often in real life)!  Loved it!",1343088000,4,249,4.391304347826087
8458340,5,B0055HOILU,"Having run nursing homes for several years, I have seen love blossom under grace, with dignity, in the face of hostile families and terminal illnesses.  This movie shows, with humor, grace and dignity, how love persists in spite of all adversity. The staff sneaking a smoke in the back, knowing how bad it is for them, the nurse who goes against the rules to push two beds together for the sake of love, and the flashbacks to the wife who comes back as a ghost, or voice, to inspire, help to make this a movie to remember.  As the patient who has endured two mastectomies, Adrienne Barbeau's character stands proudly to show that, yes, she is altered, but no less a woman because of her scars.  I have waited impatiently the last few years for this to get to dvd, and I will purchase it with joy.  If I get a home to run again, this will be featured on movie night. Watch with an open heart, and enjoy!!",1339459200,9,903,4.325443786982248
8458341,5,B0055HOILU,"""Reach For Me"" is really what a movie should be ... it reminds us what is most precious ... our human nature ... our ability to live, to laugh and to love.  What an extraordinary concept ... a grumpy, terminally ill old man falling in love and laughing in his final days.  This is a feel good movie that really changes how we perceive our own life.  We learn from people in their last days of what is most important ... the love and friendships of others and our human ability to express our emotions.

The writing is extraordinary ... one of the best written films of all time in my opinion with real life dialogue.  The cast is superb and each character is believable and invoking.  The production is first class and a film to be modeled.

Back to ""what a movie should be""  .... I feel that we have lost the romance of movies in the past couple decades.  Now most films are high budget movies where the only thing interesting are the newest graphics and explosions.  Today's films are violent, hateful and do not support family values.  ""Reach For Me"" is heartfelt and a life changing reminder of our own human nature.

Out of a hundred or so movies I have seen this year, this film is hands down my favorite.  Highly recommend.",1325116800,6,1230,4.389380530973451
