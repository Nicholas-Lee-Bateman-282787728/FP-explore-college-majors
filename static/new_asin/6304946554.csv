If you are intrigued on the subject, Trinity and Beyond is worth having in your collection.

940685,1,6304946554,"Beware:  this is a  propaganda film made to advance proponents of the bomb.  Chief among these is the reviled Edward Teller, a major player in pushing the arms race, and in branding Robert Oppenheimer a security risk and destroying his life.  Typically, Teller can't stop talking about how brilliant he is.  Even the idiot Admiral Blandy who pushed the lethal Operation Crossroads against the vehement objections of  the scientists at Los Alamos is made to look credible.

Perhaps most egregious, this film perpetuates the myth of the government's wise governance during this period and hides the atrocities it committed against its own citizens.

Not only does the film distort, mislead and gets its facts wrong, it is an amateurish hodge-podge of archival footage sometimes shown out of sequence, with phony graphics and sound effects, and with the most melodramatic over-the-top sound track you can imagine.

I'm shocked the reviews posted don't mention any of these points and are instead taken in by this hopelessly out of date bulls***--shame on you.  Thank goodness the truth about this dark period in our history has been out for decades, so in another sense this film is laughable.

See the film The Bomb if you want an accurate historical--and political--account of what actually happened, or better yet  read The Making of the Atomic Bomb, by Richard Rhodes, which won the Pulitzer Prize.",1464825600,2,1399,5.087719298245614

My guilty admission is that I am awed and terrified by the mushroom clouds of nuclear explosions.

Archival material as important as the Zapruder film.
The ""Greatest Generation"" at work - and at play.
In retrospect, it was a stroke of genius to have the Moscow Symphony Orchestra perform this soundtrack:
foreboding, vast, indomitable, inexorable, just like The State (universal as it proves to be!), to which we are all subject and fated to.

Documentation of historical fact that is thankfully agenda and bias free.
Fascinating and horrifying logic that results in ever greater demands for ""more knowledge"":
from a fraction of a kiloton to tens of megatons worth!

Assuming this is all the worthwhile footage assembled, I think it is overdue for another iteration of computer enhancement:
numerous artifacts remain frequently evident.

Other offerings from the same Kuran team are equally interesting, though less fully realized and compelling.

940846,4,6304946554,"Good history, way too much filler and over dramatic music.
Trinity and Beyond has some great history that is largely unknown but the editors failed. The film compiles a staggering amount of history related to the testing of atomic bombs by the U.S. after WWII. This information is interesting to students of the early Cold War period and this film provides one of the most comprehensive reviews of that aspect of the Cold War. However, the film contains an excessive amount of ""filler"" and could stand a great deal of editing. The overly dramatic musical score adds to the tone of the film at first but quickly becomes distracting. The music is way over done. If you can get past those shortfalls, the film offers a look into that pat of American history that has little coverage. Where it not for the interesting history buried within all of the filler, I would have rated it with 2 stars. If the editing had been better this was easily a a five star film.",1428451200,,957,4.569767441860465

940903,5,6304946554,"Although this documentary was made prior to my birth, I found it quite impressive. Admittedly, I knew relatively little about the testing done after WW II. I thought this was presented in a clear and informative manner. Of course, this led to many questions surrounding present day. After writing this review, I intend to seek more info. IMO, that's an important quality or ""benchmark"" pertaining to well-made documentaries.

I found the video footage very impressive. I've seen many clips in popular Hollywood movies throughout the years. The testing also stirs the emotions. I realize regardless of the year produced, this subject matter will continue in controversy.

This little side note is only my perspective. I'm sure it's been said countless times. Throughout, I often wondered ""what if?"" I KNOW! .. SEXIST ! .. I once was engaged to a nuclear scientist. I asked, ""what it is with 'little boys' always wanting to blow-up everything? Want peace? Let women lead..at the very least, we will talk... talk.... talk.... then talk more peace before remotely considering WMD!"" Of course, his reply was the usual non-verbal nod of understanding.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this educational documentary. My apologies for my un-politically correct side note. The film did stir some feelings of frustration & anger toward the destructive nature of mankind and the repercussions already known and/or conceivably worst unknown repercussions for generations to come.",1419379200,,1464,5.329004329004329

The latter was followed by a series of tremors felt far from the detonation site.  But hey, the Russkies were evil, so what's Anchorage by comparison?  Interesting question they might have answered if I thought of it at the time: The test was in 1968, the infamous Good Friday earthquake was in 1968.  Which came first?  Just asking, mind you.  Otherwise, nothing earthshaking here (heh, heh).  Would benefit from more investigative reporting in addition to the bare history.

I was probably most impressed by the bikini atoll underwater test where a small vertical dark mark on the side of the mushroom column is actually a large ship set up on it's end and completely vertical. And that was a relatively small nuclear detonation.

This movie is a must-see for people who didn't live in the cold-war era. It brings the awesome and terrible power of nuclear weapons to a very real and tangible place and presents the terrible progression of their horrible yet beautiful power.

Shatner does an excellent job with the narration on this amazing collection of historical footage.

This is more of a series of old films of the time. No secrets or details are exposed. This is a good movie and never promised too may technical details.

There is just as much left out as left in to get through the subject in 93 minutes to describe U.S. detonated 331 atomic devices.

It is however a fairly complete historical documentary without a log of sound bites presentations. I personally did not notice the background music (Preformed by The Moscow Symphony Orchestra) as we get this noise with just about every production now days. However it seems to have been just as much a character as the narrator in defending the mood of the viewer. However towards the end we did get a good clip from ""Where the Boys Are"" sung by Connie Francis.

If you do not recognize the narrator's voice it is of William Shatner.
We get some food footage of a young and an old Edward Teller (1908-2003). Along with this is footage of other people significant to the story.

The price they are asking for non-US customers is around $166, not including shipping. That is ridiculous. This sort of price gouging is all too common, and us non-US cutomers are becoming very angry about it.

The documentary though is excellent. It has some superb footage, good naration and a brilliant music score. It is absolutely riveting stuff, and more than a little bit chilling. (The 5 stars are based on the quality of the movie, allowing for the fact that my copy is on VHS.)

941072,5,6304946554,"Prepare to be blown away! The history of the development of mankind's most fearsome weapon is fascinating. This movie is the best on the subject. Peter Kuran (ex Star Wars special-effects director) cannot be praised enough for his monumental work in restoring previously classified footage of the US's series of atomic tests from 1946 to 1962. Realising the importance of these films and the threat of continued deterioration due to age, he has saved and given us all an eyewitness view of some truly biblical scale events:  the underwater shot, Baker, creating a two kilometer tall water column exploding from the ocean. Ivy Mike, the first ever full scale test of a Hydrogen device & shot in time lapse... the mushroom cloud billowing through the Stratosphere into Space, stretching one hundred kilometers in width! Castle Bravo(15Mt & the largest US test ever)captured on film reaching fireball diameter of 5KM in a split second...the ensuing mushroom cloud glowing, churning, crowned with condensation caps and encircled with giant rings up in the Stratosphere. I have watched tons on documentaries and other productions that have borrowed/used footage from this film as the quality is unsurpassed. The people who actually saw these things witnessed events on a scale that is truly astounding. Legendary William Shatner takes you through this fascinating period of mankind's history with understated intensity. Profound un-edited (he insisted) interviews with Edward Teller. Bonus material includes commentary by Kuran with loads of extra information & insights. A remarkably well made, and award winning, film!",1362787200,3,1615,5.408730158730159
941073,3,6304946554,"Narrated by William Shatner, this 1995 presentation laboriously documents with military archival footage, the development of the atomic and nuclear bombs produced by the United States.  While the footage is  certainly interesting and often quite impressive, this presentation could have (should have?) been edited down in the interest of time.  Shatner narrates a segment, and then a somewhat lengthy collage of films are displayed, accompanied by rousing orchestral music (the score is quite good).  The presentation is laborious because far too much time is devoted to watching the bombs go off rather than learning how an atomic weapon works, how it differs from a nuclear weapon, opinions of scientists, weapon experts, social activists, etc.  Personally, I'd rather learn a bit more about the bombs themselves than watch them detonate (although the explosion is quite powerful viewing).  The film documents the development of the two bombs used on Japan in 1945, and chronicles the atomic and nuclear tests conducted by the USA from 1946 to the Kennedy Administration.  The development of the bomb by the Soviet Union is also documented.  The number of atmospheric  nuclear bomb tests is quite astounding, considering the radioactive fallout that occurred after each detonation.  While aware of the fallout problem, both the USSR and USA continued a mad rush to test weapons of mass destruction in an attempt to gain superiority.  Nothing is documented about the Pacific Island native peoples and Russian natives who were exposed to radioactive fallout. There were test bans signed by both countries and both violated the treaties.  Once confined to two countries, nuclear weapons were also developed by Great Britain, who did their own extensive testing.  The documentary ends with the menacing test of a huge nuclear weapon by the Red Chinese.  Nothing is mentioned about Mutually Assured Destruction, the locations and numbers of nuclear missile sites in the USSR and USA, nor is anything mentioned about the other countries that are part of the nuclear bomb community (India, Pakistan, France).

Overly long with archival footage, and somewhat short on detailed and practical information, this documentary is still quite entertaining and informative.  However, it could have been so much better with more narration, and this is where the film falls short in my view.  I still give it 3 stars out of 5.

941078,1,6304946554,"I expected something much better after the universal chorus of praise for this interesting but disappointing movie. First, very little of the film consists of film of the bomb tests. Nearly all of it, and I mean more than 90%, is a rather stale rehash of the history and politics surrounding the bomb tests. This is overly familiar to most of us, and it should have been greatly condensed. This film is advertised in terms of bomb tests, not imitations of newsreels. Secondly, in terms of present technology, the bomb tests are not given the best treatment. With modern digital film techniques, creating slow-motion versious of the tests would make them much more impressive. I'd like to see the H-bomb tests at one tenth actual speed, or even slower. This would be the best way to reveal the true power of these bombs. The idea that all action on the screen must be as fast as possible was borrowed from kiddie cartoons and is not appropriate for adults. I'll also add a word about the music. The musical score of this film consists entirely of an extended and enthusiastic plagiarism of Carmina Burana, complete witn extensive choral shouting and howling. This rapidly becomes predictable and boring. I'd greatly prefer excerpts from Bruckner symphonies, because these tests were very solemn occasions, not pop music festivals. And why was so much time given to Edward Teller? Is this a bomb test movie or an Edward Teller movie? So much extraneous material was dragged into this movie that I was left wondering if some of the most interest bomb test footage had to be left out. I'll also add that the most horrific parts of the tests, namely the helpless animals that were burned to a crisp, was almost totally censored. Were the film makers scared of a boycott by PETA? There's no room for squeamishness in a movie of this kind. IMHO this film should be remade with much, MUCH more time given to the actual bomb tests, and zero time given to Dr. Strangelove Teller who was a very small flea on a very big elephant in terms of the bomb development work. Teller spent so much of his time complaining about how badly he was mistreated that he barely had time to rush to Washington to stab Oppenheiner in the back, let alone do very much significant research.

With lots of videos and pictures, I was amazed (and a bit horrified) by the number of nuclear tests that were conducted by the USA after World War II.  One begins to wonder if it was all necessary and what long term effects it had on the planet - some of this is discussed, but the mindset of the scientists and people in government as to their reasons for doing this testing is provided.  Perhaps applicable at the time, it would never fly now.

Great movie - I've watched it several times and William Shatner is an excellent narrator.

Almost as fascinating as the constant barrage of blooming orange mushroom clouds on the screen is the realization of just how recklessly fascinated our leaders actually were with this technology. It's a boys' world (or, at least, it was at the time) and so it's not entirely surprising that the men at the top of the food chain would want the biggest toy in the yard to parade around with. Still, it's tough to imagine anyone - even a selfish little brat - being so carefree with such volatile powers. The process almost parodies itself; when the US woefully underestimated the strength of ""Castle,"" a blast twice as powerful as expected that accidentally irradiated sailors and villagers alike, they barely stopped to brush themselves off before launching additional blasts below the surface of the ocean, deep under the ground and in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. The latter of which, inadvertently, introduced us to the far-reaching powers of an EMP. The historical footage dug up for this documentary is riveting and amazing, fantastic fodder for fireball-lovers, but I couldn't stop wondering how we got through it all in one piece. These guys only thought they knew what they were doing, or had at best a vague idea, and in a lot of ways that's worse than just lighting the fuse and standing around with a clipboard and a pair of safety goggles.",1335830400,,1564,4.883458646616542

941113,3,6304946554,"First off, its great to watch the explosions, although sometimes you wish you could see an entire scene at once without hectic cuts. Its still wonderfull to watch it on a big screen if you like this sort of things.

On the other hand we run into a problem the moment we classify this as ""historical correct"". Its not, its of course US biased as its told from that perspective. If you have no historic background you may get false impressions from this.

The most prominent example of this is when they talk about the ""Tsar Bomb"" (or monster bomb):

- we know today it was not secretly developed over 2 years, but build in a few weeks with off the shelve components when the muratorium was about to end anyways and the US would not prolong it. As the UDSSR could not build precise bombs, it had to build large bombs to destroy the target even when not hitting it directly.

- the movie tells the viewer the bomb was to be delivered by plane. Thats only half the truth. It could, in fact, not be fitted inside the bomb bay, thus you see it under the plane. The plane was extremely slow because of that. So, it was in fact unpractical and done only to show off at the time as the US didn't think the UDSSR could build anything larger then 10MT.

- it was one of the CLEANEST BOMBS EVER to be detonated, because the uranium shell was replaced with lead (thus it had only 50MT, not 57MT as portraied in the movie, instead of the possible 100MT). Now, they leave the UN-propaganda speech in without commenting it, and thats a NOGO for a documentary, as it gives everyone a totally FALSE impression. Why this information is left out is a mistery and looks really bad.

The US did alot more tests the UDSSR ever did, and ending the movie with the impression the Chinese are now the ""bad boy"" is also very dubious. We are not in the cold war anymore, but this movie is from 1995, we know better then this. Looks bad again.

So, don't take the movie too seriously from a historical perspective (they also left out things like the nuclear rifle wich would make the US look bad but is still an interesting piece of nuclear hardware worth mentioning), just take it for the nice pictures.",1312502400,,2174,4.353086419753087

 With a mixture of interviews, filmed recordings and occaisonal CGI, the impact of the decision to approve the tests and destructive force of the weapons is brought home.
The HD transfer is superb, particularly the better preserved film footage. The colour pallete and contrast really shows the explosions in a truly terrifying light, making one thankful they were used only once in anger - a fact not ignored in the film.

941206,3,6304946554,"First know that I love footage of explosions, BUT... they need to be shown in their entirety.

I think this film exists for two purposes: as a documentary, and for its visual fascination. As a documentary, it's fine. But I must admit, I bought it to see explosions.

Think for a moment about modern film editing. Action scenes are usually made of very short clips, cutting as fast as 1/4 of a second. The MTV generation of kids is used to this style. It gives a sense of motion and action, but it also cheats the viewer of seeing something in its entirety and in context. In some movies (such as ""Children of Men""), action scenes are very long. I find this infinitely more satisfying. I also think that live plays or shows are more satisfying than movies because I can see the whole space. No film editor is manipulating my attention.

The TV show ""Mythbusters"" frequently shows explosions. The editor apparently thinks they are more impressive as brief clips, changing from perspective to perspective. That annoys me. An explosion should be seen in its entirety from a single camera point-of-view with no cutting.

Unfortunately, ""Trinity and Beyond"" adopts the same style as ""Mythbusters."" The never show an entire explosion. They cut through different perspectives. Someday I want to see an entire nuclear explosion from the dark sky at the beginning, through the initial fireball, all the way to the moment when the fireball fades and the mushroom cloud is breaking apart. This movie doesn't provide that.

They also add fake sound effects. Hint: when you are filming an explosion from 25 miles away, you won't hear the sound for several minutes. When there is a cheesy explosion noise the instant of the fireball, you know it's fake.",1280448000,,1738,4.818791946308725
941207,5,6304946554,"This documentary follows the entire evolution of the atomic bomb, from the first scaling test at Trinity, to the last moments of the cold war.  Almost all the footage comes from de-classified military films of the experiments and tests.  Most of the rest consists of news real footage from the time.  The movie consists of a sequence of natural milestones in the history of the nuclear weapons development:  e.g. this was the first simple uranium bomb, this was the first thermonuclear device, this was the first tritium accelerator bomb, this was the first H-Bomb, etc.  Each stage of development is capped with a successful test explosion, which is usually above ground, and in our natural environment.

When you stop to consider that the Hiroshima was destroyed by a simple 15 kiloton bomb, and both the Russians and we American's detonated many scores of devices vastly more powerful than that, you are amazed that the world is still here, and that we still live.  The Russians blew up a 5 megaton device above ground in Siberia, for God's sake! That is the equivalent of 333.333 Hiroshimas.

It is no wonder that so many people in 1960s through 1980s developed cancer.  It was understood, as early as the 1950s, that radio active fallout was entering our food supply by binding with the calcium in cow's milk.  Of course, there are many active pathways, but this particular one was understood early on.  This documentary will scare the hell out of you, and it will make you question the current research that indicates most cancer is a product of virus activity in the human body.

This documentary is presented in a very calm, cool, matter-of-fact fashion.  The director and writers do not make firebrand political speeches during the course of this documentary.  They just present the sequence of events using archive footage, and a minimum number of interviews with folks like Edward Teller.

While this approach will not please the young (and exceeding stupid) Berkeley political firebrand, this is by far the most effective technique for communicating the dangers of nuclear weapons, weapons development, and nuclear testing.  I noticed that several no-nuke Greenies posted reviews that expressed some dismay at the detached nature of the documentary.  They should not be dismayed.  The tone is the key to this documentaries success. The directors are to be congratulated for this.",1279411200,,2391,5.025380710659898
941208,4,6304946554,"This movie is truly informative and, at times, breathtaking. The destructive power of the nuclear bomb both fascinates and haunts us. Whenever I think of atomic weaponry, I like to recall one great quote by the late Richard Feynman (a Nobel Prize winning physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project when he was younger), who described his emotions after returning home from the Manhattan Project thusly:

""I returned to civilization shortly after that and went to Cornell to teach, and my first impression was a very strange one. I can't understand it any more, but I felt very strongly then. I sat in a restaurant in New York, for example, and I looked out at the buildings and I began to think, you know, about how much the radius of the Hiroshima bomb damage was and so forth... How far from here was 34th street?... All those buildings, all smashed -- and so on. And I would see people building a bridge, or they'd be making a new road, and I thought, they're crazy, they just don't understand, they don't understand. Why are they making new things? It's so useless. But, fortunately, it's been useless for almost forty years now, hasn't it? So I've been wrong about it being useless making bridges and I'm glad those other people had the sense to go ahead.""

The one question I kept pondering long after I finished viewing the documentary is this: How is it that we have not yet destroyed ourselves, 65 years after first obtaining the knowledge and the means to do so?  The answer I get is always the same: God's grace and mercy will continue to extend to the human race until HE decides it is time for the final judgment.  At that time, all the weapons of mass destruction ever used, tested, stockpiled, dismantled, conceived or theorized since the beginning of the atomic age, even if detonated all at once, will seem as insignificant as one single, solitary pin drop.",1273449600,,786,4.835820895522388

Appearance by Edward Teller. This man DID NOT do interviews; yet the director was able to coax a couple of precise minutes from the Father of the H-Bomb. Both the interview and the commentary about it are fascinating.

Appearance by Frank Shelton. Another rare appearance---to hear his voice describe aspects of the various bombs that were tested, while sitting there with an as-of-matter-of-fact tone, is mesmerizing.

William Shatner. When I first heard his voice, I thought it a bit comedic; however, I was easily won over. He does a terrific job here.

The film. The director's attempt to clean up these old films was a dead on success. Some of them are unusually good given the era from which they were filmed. Buffs might find having these in their collection is worth the price by itself.

What other term but ""cult classic"" could one use for a film that is wholly unforgettable and awe-inspiring?",1202601600,3,1234,4.797169811320755

941357,4,6304946554,"The Atomic Bomb Movie conveys more about the ""progress"" (if that word can be used in this context) of the nuclear arms race than it perhaps means to. Even as it shows glamorous-looking nuclear footage, it unintentionally conveys a strong anti-nuclear message.  As we move sequentially from the detonation of 100 tons of conventional explosives to the initial 10,000-ton (10 kiloton, or 10-kT) Trinity explosion in New Mexico, to Hiroshima and Nagasaki (likewise 10-20 kT yields), and then on to 10-to-60 million-ton (10-60 MT) explosions (jumping not by a factor of two but by a factor of 1000 in explosive yield as we go!), we are witnesses to a spectacular example of psychological desensitization. (And believe me, the footage shown in this film is spectacular, if that's the right word, beyond belief.)

This theme of desensitization is borne out by the interviews with two atomic weaponeers, Frank Shelton and Edward Teller. Shelton is a regular-guy engineer, and seems highly accomplished in his trade. But it's Teller who is truly revealing (and revealed), as he disingenuously claims that he only wanted to ""gain knowledge that would deter Stalin"" militarily when he sought to build the real doomsday weapon, the hydrogen bomb, in the 1950s. (Teller doesn't get around to explaining that, unlike Hiroshima-type fission weapons that can only be built up to a size of tens of kilotons, which is quite enough to establish a deterrent force, fusion-powered hydrogen bombs can reach unlimited yields--tens to hundreds of megatons--limited only by the weight-carrying capacity of delivery systems.) Teller sounds quite proud when he describes how he pushed Truman very hard to build those things, and he looks and sounds immensely and smugly self-satisfied when he says that Truman ""made the right choice"" to develop those Strangelovian things.

In the movie, we see H-bomb shots that reach tens of millions of tons of TNT-equivalent yield, the unholy children of Edward Teller and his co-inventor (and even smarter innovator) Stan Ulam. (Teller, by the way, barely credits Ulam as the co-inventor of the H-bomb, right under his breath. Talk about a display of megalomania--Teller doesn't even want to share the credit for inventing the doomsday device that can end civilization.) What we see happening throughout The Atomic Bomb Movie, despite the efforts of the people who were making these weapons to make us believe otherwise, is the normalization of horrific power into a stockpile of devices that these people apparently believed could be used and controlled as if they were nothing more than oversized artillery shells. (We do see an atomic cannon being fired--WOW, would that have ever been fun, I've got to admit!!) They seem to think of them as merely oversized flash bulbs.

They weren't (and aren't) flash bulbs, and the film footage in this movie demonstrates exactly why they simply cannot ever be used in any meaningful sense. After you have seen this film you may be able to begin to understand why only a few dozen of the smallest types, with Hiroshima-Nagasaki types of yields, will always be enough to deter any country from attacking another--and why they are utterly useless as military weapons. Concomitant with that understanding is the realization that the interview claims made by Teller (who eventually talked Reagan into thinking that atomic-bomb-powered Star Wars systems could actually be built and would be effective) are so disingenuous as to amount to lies. This movie clearly demonstrates the futility of pursuing the development of atomic weapons by --any-- country.

This DVD does not tell the story of science run amok; science as an enterprise of the human spirit has practically nothing to do with any of the shots that appear in this film. What could have ever been the ""scientific"" point of subjecting humans and animals to the ghastly ""test shot"" effects that we see portrayed in this movie, white-coated field technicians who examine post-shot, dead and dying animals notwithstanding? There's that desensitization thing again.

No, it wasn't for science that this work was done. This movie demonstrates that it was for the sake of hubris, of satisfying a misguided demand for ""power"" that these shots were fired, and that humans and animals (both the ones near the bombs and the ""downwinders"" across the United States and around the world) were treated as if they were irrelevant or worse. The situation regarding human subjects becomes simply ludicrous when we see a little old lady from some Podunk Junction hometown, a real-life Ma Kettle, being interviewed while sitting in a slit trench in pre-dawn darkness, awaiting an atomic-test-range bomb blast while wearing her oversized Civil Defense hard hat. OMG. Apparently the US government wanted to get some film footage of her to reassure ""regular"" people that, in the event of an actual atomic war, we would all just ride out a blast or two and then go on with our lives--an example of desensitization taken to the tenth power. Never mind that by the time that footage was composed, the bomb arsenals of the US and USSR were large enough to obliterate the entire world's civilization several times over, or that, as Winston Churchill said, all the nuclear powers were managing to do was to ensure that they could ""make the rubble bounce"".

In another example of desensitization, this time with respect to fiscal responsibility, The Atomic Bomb Movie shows how the governments of the US and USSR became accustomed to spending unlimited sums of money to pursue increasingly bizarre and useless engineering feats (namely the building and firing of increasingly larger and increasingly irrelevant bombs) toward no useful end. For some reason, there never was (and apparently still isn't) enough money available in either country to pay for nutrition or health care for people who are poor, but the US and USSR clearly never lacked the money to fund even the weirdest enterprises that people like Teller could devise. This movie documents the firing of hundreds of bombs that each cost hundreds of thousands to millions (and in some cases billions) of dollars apiece. And what have we now got to show for all of that, given that we had a secure deterrent force when we had built the first few hundred Hiroshima-size bombs by about 1950? What have now got to show for all of the money that was spent for the last six decades on developing and building more and more of these things?  Just a lot of wasted effort that could have been gone into more productive pursuits, if this movie gives us any indication at all.

This movie confirms the conclusion of President Eisenhower (himself no stranger to war and certainly no softie on defense issues) when he bemoaned the unholy alliance that he saw developing between hubristic military leaders who wanted unlimited power, of American industries that profited handsomely from bomb production and bomb testing (we see, for example, how Western Electric found that early atomic bombs were hand-crafted oddities and then turned A-bomb production into an efficient, mass-production operation employing tens of thousands of assembly-line workers including lots of women who look like our mothers), and of political people who thought they could buy ""security"" and ""credibility"" if only they could build a big enough atomic stockpile--which turned out to never be big enough to make us secure at all. We see all of them working together to expend uncountable sums of money on utterly useless and destructive weapons.

The Atomic Bomb Movie's unintentional messages make it a must-see DVD. By looking like pro-atomic propaganda, it (apparently unwittingly) becomes the best anti-atomic piece that you can find. It has a more effective anti-atomic message than any intentionally anti-atomic movie could have ever achieved. I would like to think that the people who made it understood this--and perhaps they did; they're clearly pretty smart cookies. The movie is ably produced and narrated by Messrs. Kuran and Shatner, respectively. The only reason that I have given it four stars instead of five is that I think it substantially underplays the ghastly effects of atomic bombs on humans, animals, and the Earth's environment. But I do understand why it had to be made this way: If the full extent of atomic effects had been documented in this film, it would have probably been essentially unsellable. No thinking, non-desensitized human being would be able to watch that kind of show for more than a few seconds. So as this genre goes, The Atomic Bomb Movie is as good as you're going to get.",1197158400,8,8623,5.079040225829217

Nuclear weapons are not just big bombs, they have a major impact which goes beyond the initial blast.

While it's interesting to watch the size of the weapons get bigger and bigger, the movie barely touches on the repercussions of detonanting nuclear weapons even in a test. There was little acknowledgement of radiation disease, the after-effects of the bombing on Japan, nor the current lasting effects of the USA bombing it's own territories for nuclear testing.

A nice sub-sub-title might be ""5000 explosions and a supernova"" (to steal a title from Arthur).

For the rest of us who, for whatever reason, want to believe that world peace and unconditional love are possible, have a bottle of Advil ready if you watch this DVD because it will make your head hurt.  It will make you want to crawl beneath a rock and weep, or find a spaceship to take you far, far away from this planet.

This film is a brilliant achievement.  It successfully balances itself between presenting ""big science"" in action and shining a spotlight on human madness.  Those viewers who are a part of this madness won't see anything unusual in the (extensive) footage that doesn't involve actual explosions; those who abhor it will only be able to shake their heads in wonder at the poker-faced insanity of it all.

More than a film about atomic weapons, this is a film about mankind's apparently limitless capacity for ""normalizing"" almost anything; even suicidal, mutual mass incineration.  I believe that the counter-culture revolution that began in the mid-60's was in large part a reaction to a society that was trying to ""normalize"" the idea of Grandma keeping her gas mask and radiation suit close at hand in the kitchen cabinet, right between the steak sauce and the cake flour.

A nuclear explosion is just a release of energy.  After the fourth or fifth one, they all start looking the same.  But there is no end to the fascination offered by scenes of people making attempts to ""live with"" the reality of impending nuclear war.  That's something so outlandish and so incomprehensible that it bears watching again and again.

My only complaint about this film, (and the reason for my withholding the fifth star,) is that the director and co. are far too squeamish.  We get one brief scene of pigs running in panic as their skins are broiled off, before the blast wave hits them.  We get another momentary glimpse of a severely burned pig, apparently still alive, being ""observed"" by white-suited scientists who apparently find agony and death-throes very interesting and fascinating.

But what we don't see, is what radiation sickness really looks like.  We don't see the frozen figures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, arms raised against the last light they would ever see, standing amidst the wreckage as steaming statues of flesh ash.  We don't get to see the burned children, writhing and weeping in agony because somebody decided to drop a bomb on their city while they were playing.

But I suppose if we'd seen all that, then the film might not have sold as many copies.  As it is, for anyone who is alive from the neck up, it will leave you slack jawed.",1105920000,14,2751,4.739495798319328
941467,5,6304946554,"""The Atomic Bomb Movie"" is the most impressive, visually stunning and well-assembled film ever made on the history of the nuclear bomb and the various tests that followed after the end of World War 2. It is a documentary made with real passion for the subject, the information and visual records. This is obviously Peter Kuran's baby (listen to the commentary track where he speaks about the awakening of his interest in nuclear testing and the eventual production of this film with the awe and wonder of discovery), every aspect of his dedication to the project is evident in how much information he gives us, the detail in the assembly and most of all, in the painstaking restoration of old military footage documentating numerous tests. Visually this is one of the most incredible films you will ever see. One can only watch in astonishment at the size and destruction and yet beauty we find in the shots of tests ranging from Bikini island to even outer space. For many a lot of what the movie shows will be shockingly new (for me the biggest surprise was indeed the information about nuclear bombs being detonated in space). Kuran takes inside of the effects of a nuclear blast, so much as to show us exactly what an attack scenario would be like if you were inside your home and a bomb was dropped. And all this is done with incredible clarity, a lot of the old footage has been lovingly polished to a gloss and rarely do any images look old or scratchy. All this is framed with William Stromberg's rich, epic score that marches and pulses with great gusto. ""The Atomic Bomb Movie"" is that special kind of documentary that is perfect for classroom exhibition but also an awesome experience for normal home viewing. Kuran has done a service by assembling this film because it is important to preserve this information for future generations. In his commentary Kuran stresses the importance of not letting people forget about the history of nuclear testing, so it doesn't repeat itself.

The three Squaw submarines were built there and later I was told two of them were destroyed in the test.  But nothing was ever said in the papers about it.  Well, it was only about 500 miles from San Diego, or 600 from Long Beach. However the Operation Crossroads films were the best I had seen of Major Woodrow Swancutt who flew the B-29 that dropped the bomb in Test Able.  ""Woody"" was a cousin of mine and we listened to his bomb drop on the radio back in 1946.
But what really made me sit up and pay attention was the tests done later and with more and more powerful devices.  Our first Hydrogen Bomb didn't even look like a bomb, but more like a refinery building in Wilmington.  Then the USSR built a super-duper 50 megaton bomb that was air transportable and the film of it dropping from a bomber was very sobering.  I don't know how the producers got a hold of that film, but I found myself on the edge of my seat.
But even more sobering are the last scenes showing China's nuclear test and how they would follow up with cavalry (horses wearing gas masks no less).

The ""documentary"" consists of an obvious, superficial history with no intellectual or analytical distinction.  Most bothersome is my suspicion that some of the footage has been colorized (black and white frames digitally duotoned, for instance) and accentuated (increased saturation, etc.).  Make no mistake- the footage looks fabulous, and the film is an almost irresistable purchase.  But don't expect it to tell you much, and don't trust its integrity.",1000252800,10,755,5.372881355932203
941523,5,6304946554,"Forget hollywood special effects, This movie has the most powerful images that i've ever seen. I never realized the full extent of the horrific testing that was done by the U.S. and other nations. This really is a historical documentary of the development of nuclear weapons, so don't expect much scientific analysis or explanation. But it is a very well-made documentary with comprehensive footage of the various military nuclear projects, interviews with the nuclear scientists, historical newsreels, and of course tons of footage of A-Bombs and H-Bombs being detonated all over the place (in the upper atmosphere, underground, underwater, shot out of a canon, etc.) I really can't say enough about this interesting and visually striking movie. The images are enough to put anyone in awe and fear. The soundtrack is also great, and it accompanies the horrific images very nicely.
 Also, this DVD has some other nice features. The best is the short 3D movie, which explores one specific Nevada test site. I really liked this feature, It has some really cool footage which is even more striking in 3D. The photo slide show was also cool. The unedited bomb explosion wasn't that great, but it was alright. The total presentation of the DVD is certainly very nice, and the movie itself is simply amazing. I would highly recommend this product. 5 STARS!",989020800,60,1350,5.026785714285714
941524,5,6304946554,"I would just like to start off by saying that this is BY FAR the best documentary I have ever seen and probably ever will see.  I ordered the DVD (You should too!!) right after I saw it.  One thing to remember...no matter how much of an A-bomb maniac you might be, no matter the dozens of documentaries you've seen, YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FOOTAGE.  One and only declassified images and videos from dozens of nuclear research and detonations.  The score mixes seemlessly with the images to take your breath away at the sight of the huge, towering, yet beautiful behemoth of the mushroom cloud.  Includes surface, underground, low atmospheric, undersea, and high altitude detonations, including the one that disrupted radio communications for 8 hours and damaged electrical circuits with it's Electromagnetic Pulse.  This film is not too scientific for ANYONE!!  Buy it, watch it, and memorize it, but for heavens sake, learn from it too!!  Don't ever forget it!!  But then again, you won't want to!!!",986515200,29,999,4.898809523809524
941565,5,6304946554,"Definately the best documentary I've seen on nuclear weapons so far. From Trinity to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, this superb film touches on just about everything. I have to praise it for being one of the few documentaries with an un-biased approach to nuclear weapons that I've seen, leaving the viewer to their own opionins and conclusions. The terrifying yet strangely beautiful footage set to a wonderful and dramaitc score provides the viewer with a memorable history lesson.",984355200,3,481,5.10126582278481

This movie will show you just what could be in store for us should some jerk push the button. Like some of the other reviewers, I would have like a more insighful and technical story, but I accept this movie for what it is. The incredible number of tests shown are something else. I also learned how many tests the USA conducted, eliminating entire atolls, and how we even accelerated our testing in anticipation of a test ban. No wonder the Russians were afraid of us.  Not a movie for everyone, but a great reminder of what is possible in our world. Let's hope not.",981504000,,686,4.4015748031496065
941568,3,6304946554,"It is quite hard to rate this documentary.  On the one hand the footage is cleaned up so well and the sound quality so fantastic.  On the other hand  the narration leaves you with so many unanswered questions.  The movie is  so matter of fact yet the issues, in reality, go to the very core of every  human life.
I enjoyed watching the stunning visual display but would have  liked less music to get a more real, and life like, feel of what it is like  to be near an atomic blast.
Some of the unanswered, and unasked,  questions would be what is currently known of the effects of all those  tests, under water, under ground, high in the stratosphere, and just above  ground?  What kinds of radiation was released and how long does it last and  how can it effect life today?
I am giving this documentary three stars  but I still suggest it.  I suggest it along with some other documentaries  to fill in the gaps that this one leaves.  The Atomic Cafe is a good place  to start.  No one beats the technical skill of this documentary however.",967420800,16,1039,4.345549738219895
941569,5,6304946554,"The footage will leave you stunned and jaw dropped.  The music, ironically performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, is excellent.  The film doesn't  worry about getting into the technical nitty-gritty and so will be  appealing to a wide audience, although hard-core nuke-geeks might get a  little miffed.  The movie clearly places its emphasis on visuals rather  than a lot of narration, but the historical information and what little  narration there is is both well timed and educational.  One thing to watch  for is the interviews with former scientists that worked on some of the  nuclear projects.  It's unsettling (although understandable given their  task) that people should talk about such devices so flatly and  unemotionally.  This is a film that everyone should see because it puts the  unimaginable power and horror of atomic weapons in clear perspective.",967161600,5,871,5.294117647058823

941571,4,6304946554,"The power with which mankind has set forth upon the world with the simple goal of killing their fellow man.  As each generation builds upon the last,  it is the technological advances of military power which seep their way  downward toward the eventual ""peaceful"" societal use.  However,  as is evident in the contents of this DVD, never before has such a weapon  been produced that so many wish could be  ""uninvented.""
""Trinity and Beyond"" is not a  glorification of the Cold War and the arms race that ensued from it.  Rather, it is a harsh criticism of the game of brinksmanship  that led us  closer and closer to crossing the line toward mutually assured destruction.  The footage is fascinating, Shatner's narration superb, yet the only word  capable of describing this documentary is...  unsettling.  As the power of  these bombs increases as movie goes on, the sweat will begin to bead on  your forehead as it slowly dawns on you that for half a century, nuclear  technology ruled us.
This is not a political documentary.  It does not  explain the causes of nuclear proliferation, nor does it set blame.  It  merely shows the power of God in the hands of mere mortals, and makes you  think about whether or not we are evolved enopugh to handle that which we  have set forth upon the Earth.",965692800,3,1296,4.683035714285714

941615,4,6304946554,"All around this is a very good DVD. The main feature (narrated by William Shatner) is by far the best documentary that I have seen about all of the nuclear weapon testing that was done in the 40s-60s.  I am not really  ""into"" nukes, per se, so I didn't think the footage was  particularly awesome.  The truth about the footage is that it is old and  grainy and a lot of it is B&W.  Also, while I am on the negatives, the  '3D' footage and the 'actual sounds of an explosion' in 5.1 surround sound  were a little bit of a let down - and I have a plenty good surround sound  system.
But I have to give the DVD 4 stars for being a really enjoyable  documentary from which I learned a lot about the United States' nuclear  weapons testing.  For example, I had NO idea that we blew off so many  'devices' and experimented with so many different delivery systems.

941616,5,6304946554,"If you are a Cold War history buff, or if you can still remember the days when you participated in those  drop and cover bomb drills while going to school, then you must see ""Trinity and Beyond"" on DVD.  Filmmaker  Peter Kuran has meticulously weaved together previously classified  government footage of the numerous atomic bomb tests which were conducted  at the height of the Cold War.  Many of these secret films were  painstakingly restored to level fully compatable with the DVD format.  The  images of the bomb blasts exhibit a stark and shocking beauty as  superheated gases and fallout expand into the atmosphere.  Another  unsettling segment shows a mannikin ""Ozzie and Harriet"" family in  their home.  They are completely decimated during a bomb test to determine  the effects of nuclear warfare on the civilian population.
This  documentary has a magnificent score performed by the Moscow Symphony  Orchestra and is perfectly in-sync with the awe, beauty and destructive  power of the atomic bomb blasts.  The DVD version boasts a wealth of extra  features for even the most die-hard DVD connoiseur.  These extras include a  fully interactive menu, a photo slide show, a separate CD track of the  orchestral score, and even a 3D segment of an atomic explosion with 3D  glasses included.  After viewing the 3D segment, you may feel like taking a  de-con shower!
The narration by William Shatner is both informational and  unbiased.  Despite the interviews with Dr. Edward Teller (Father of the  H-bomb) and others, ""Trinity and Beyond"" leaves it to the viewers  to decide the ingenius foresight or the foolish arrogance of the scientists  and soldiers who have harnessed the energy of the atom.  This movie is also  a powerful reminder of our past history.  How ironic it would be to repeat  this chapter again, especially in light of recent allegations that China  has stolen America's most secret nuclear weapon designs.
""Trinity  and Beyond"" is not just another dry documentary.  If you have invested  a small fortune into your home theater system and DVD player, then rest  assured.  This DVD version of ""Trinity and Beyond"" will make your  investment pay-off handsomely.  Get this DVD now...and prepare to RUN, DUCK  and COVER!",935798400,99,2243,5.043956043956044

Got this amazing Blu Ray for Christmas, and was stunned to find out it was a 2015 restoration that Peter Kuran has put together with the help of a Kickstarter campaign to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the first nuclear test and subsequent deployment in Japan.

As I was watching the film I started getting a bit lost.  Was I seeing old scenes I had simply forgotten about?  Nope, it was previously unreleased material that had been edited out of the original film and added in glorious high definition.  Sound effects, and even new music accompany these scenes.  Extends some of the interviews the nuclear scientists give as well.

Had I known of this Kickstarter campaign in 2015, I might have broken the bank to donate enough for the executive producer credit on this edition.  I love the film that much!
