5985871,5,B00FEXL3OA,"The DVD sound and picture are perfect!  As for the show itself?  Absolutely incredible.  It starts off super dark and angry.  By the second and third number they're wielding guns with blood spattering on the screen.  It's ferocious, but don't let that turn you off as there is a point.  The whole show takes on a journey from dark to light as she transforms on stage.  There are about five separate sections within the show and by the second section Madonna appears as a cheerleader with a bright light extravaganza that is almost like a hot pep rally.  By the end of the show and the last section, she's transformed into a spiritual guru celebrating the power of life and spirit.

It's mind blowing to watch this hard working woman on the stage.  Her showmanship is present in every frame.  Just watching her is motivating in itself.  Madonna's body looks incredible and even better than those in their 20's.  It's amazing to watch someone with so much energy and stamina.  She dominates the stage and shines the greatest when she's performing.  She's one of the final major entertainers left on the scene.  Michael Jackson was the other one and now he's gone.  When she was going on tour, I knew that I had to go see her regardless if she was going to be performing songs from an album that I found to be less than stellar.  She did not disappoint.

If there are any negatives with this show, it's that the bulk of songs performed are from her MDNA album which wasn't the most popular or her best musically.  However, her performances on the stage are so fantastic that you quickly forget about the song and are mesmerized by all of the sets, the lights, the messages within the technically choreographed numbers.  That was another thing.  I've seen a lot of live shows and nothing compares to these dancers on the stage - including her.  She is a trained dancer first and foremost so its no surprise that she dominates that arena.  She does perform some old stuff including Papa Don't Preach, Hung Up, Express Yourself, Vogue, Like a Prayer, Open Your Heart, Like a Virgin.  Although a couple of those like Open Your Heart and Like a Virgin have a different musical arrangement that takes away the original flavor of the hit.  Still as I said, the performance on stage is top notch that you find yourself not caring that the song has been altered.  Highly recommend this show for those who want to be entertained and uplifted.",1383609600,19,2429,4.588372093023255

5985886,2,B00FEXL3OA,"The last hour is the best.  The first hour is pretty creepy.  One song is about killing her lover.  It goes on forever!  If I had known the first part was so bad, I wouldn't have bought it and I love Madonna!",1454544000,,208,3.880952380952381
5985887,2,B00FEXL3OA,"Been a huge fan of madonnas for some time now. Like since 'Borderline' came out. So i guess my expectations and criticisms are higher than most. Her previous tour 'sticky and sweet ', was electrifying with fun,high energy, colorful sets that appeals to all her fans new and not so new. It was choreographed to just be a really good time, and it was! So that being said, this go-around has a different vibe to it. Of course its grand production alone is enough to marvel at.
Its still Madonna and the hits are their its just begins really dark and kinda cold. And she doesnt seem to have that fun connection with her dancers, well,except for one. And her recent tour,well thats clearly a demonic trip through hell. I don't even know if I'll buy rebel dvd or not. MDNA is a great show, and i recommended the purchase.",1454284800,3,815,4.44
5985888,1,B00FEXL3OA,"Concert was dope, but the sound quality is terrible when you stream it via Amazon video. I'm assuming they uploaded a rip from the defective video that came out at first. I'm severally disappointed. Amazon, please fix this issue. The concert is already two years old, and your selling this crappy stream to your costumers? Disgusting.",1451433600,,334,4.982142857142857

5985890,5,B00FEXL3OA,"This is surprisingly a mostly excellent DVD. Visually it's amazing and you can tell Madonna busted her rear end to put on a stunning show for her audience. I personally love the set list, but casual fans would probably have liked more of her iconic hits performed. Just approach watching the concert with an open mind!",1440460800,,318,4.696428571428571
5985891,4,B00FEXL3OA,"Great show, love Madonna, filming of the show is a little more...... let's go with ""artistic"" then I would have liked it to be, but that all her. Definitely a must have.",1439510400,,169,4.3125
5985912,5,B00FEXL3OA,"What else can be said about the Queen of Pop. Let me see hmmmmm, she is the greatest female entertainer. Has sold over 200 million albums, #1 in concert female artist in the world.....and her recent CD went number#1, again, on a global scale. Just buy it, enjoy it, have fun...because in the end Madonna aims high when it comes to her performances....and she always has fun on the stage...",1439337600,,389,4.571428571428571

5985915,3,B00FEXL3OA,"Huge Madonna fan here, it is really hard to honestly give anything of hers a less than five star rating, because in comparison to all her competition even her lower quality work is still top notch. So keep in mind I'm comparing it to her other work, not the entire industry. I am giving it three stars because out of all her tours, I would not place it in the top three (I would put Confessions, Blonde Ambition and either Drowned World or Girlie Show in that spot) ...... Perhaps fourth (maybe). The video is actually over two hours long and I stopped it at one hour and plan on watching the rest later .... You know it's not her best work when you're not on the edge of your seat the whole time. I saw Confessions live so I guess the bar is set pretty high for me. I am looking forward to Rebel Heart but no longer sad that I missed this one. I shudder to imagine what Sticky Sweet was like (based on the album, not ticket sales; wondering how that even happened), but I'll probably rent it next because I'm a total junkie for her. I recently got the right electronics to do rentals like this so I'm catching up. Altogether I'm glad I got the chance to see it, but if you are going to only watch one of her tours I'd pick one of the top three I mentioned first.",1437264000,,1263,4.138211382113822

5985942,3,B00FEXL3OA,"Saw this live and didn't like it. However since I own all the other Madonna concerts on DVD I decided to purchase this one and give it another shot on my TV. I still didn't like it. lol  Some songs are really good, most are boring and couldn't keep my attention. Favorite is Open Your Heart - amazing rendition of this song! Makes me like it better than the original. Like A Virgin wanted to make me hang myself (you'll see). As usual Madonna concerts are not shot for the epileptic at heart, so if constant flipping frames aren't your thing, don't bother with this. Some said the Blu Ray was a disaster with picture and sound quality, so I stuck with the regular DVD and it's fine. All in all, it's a very dark concert and it's just okay.",1395964800,,739,4.2785714285714285

Madonna still the best innovator out their, Have heard that people think that she on the decline and young  singers  will pick up the reigns and take over.  Watch out...Madonna not done yet can't wait to see and hear more music from her new and exciting.  Seeing this DvD concert of hers amazing concept and visualy stunning work.

5985949,5,B00FEXL3OA,"I am so happy that a new pressing of this great concert was re-issued! No more audio or video issues! It's a great experience!!

The concert itself is amazing! Madonna is truly a great entertainer and performer and what shocks me more than anything is that she can do all of this at her age and she looks great! Truly inspiring and amazing performance. The constant editing takes getting used to but it actually makes for great repeat plays where as a conventionally shot concert does not. The songs from MDNA aren't as exciting as her back catalog but that's only because they are new and I suspect in time some will become beloved classics. Truly a great concert experience! ;)",1387065600,,679,4.6115702479338845

8615024,4,B00FEXL3OA,"Being her second highest grossing tour of all time right after her Sticky & Sweet tour, it was pretty well structured. The themes, choreography, set up and tracks (somewhat) fulfilled all expectations. It was the top grossing tour of 2012 afterall! The book could have been better showing moments from different themes of the tour throughout and the CD could have had a better artwork. The recording angles and style was slightly different than from her previous tours but it was, in a way, better. My only concern was that the audio CD and DVD are sold separately unlike before so I had to buy this DVD as well to complete my collection. Overall, I really did enjoy this release.",1475539200,,680,4.675

8615027,5,B00FEXL3OA,"This tour, more than anything, is art. If you know she grew up here in NYC around the likes of Basquiat, Warhol, and Haring, and if you know that 'Material Girl' is ironic, social critique and are prepared for art and not entertainment's pandering, this is your show. I say it is her best, and I could discuss it endlessly. Brutal, tender, complex and multi-faceted. Approach it as theatre, and open your mind (and heart.)",1470614400,2,422,4.64
