4857785,5,B005Q12ZG0,"Brother Janks has done it again. With the same relatable, uncomfortable, relevant, and piercing approach as his previous DVD's (What Black Men Think, Men to Boys, He Hates You, et al) Social activist and documentarian Janks Morton strikes a nerve with DEAR DADDY. He shines a searing hot spotlight and uncovers the often under-represented and unattractive under-belly of fatherlessness and its long term effects on the daughters in our communities. He embeds himself in a community and invites young women this time to talk openly and very candidly about their fathers OR lack thereof. By listening and not talking Janks facilitates and opens a remarkable deluge of inner personal thoughts, tears, open denial, anger, hatred, need for love, and gratitude as these young woman unselfishly bear their souls on camera. They experience a cathartic freedom by releasing these shut down and shut out feeling coming face-to-face with feeling may have not acknowledged since they were very young about their fathers....and mothers. My only complaint is that Janks doesn't put a disclaimer about not providing any Kleenex or handkerchiefs with he purchase of the DVD!!

But Janks doesn't just ""drop an weapon of mass destruction"" and then leave the room, he opens up the door for forgiveness, accountability and indeed reconciliation by encouraging the development of dialogue, and healing centers in local communities to start partnering with clinical, civic, faith-based and social work professionals to start this reconciliation process.  It was so refreshing to see these young women in many cases have the burden of carrying all of these dysfunctional feelings inside of them be able to release it. This is a step in the right course correction and direction in preparation for these women choosing their own future mates and becoming parents themselves. This will invariably help to ""break this vicious cycle"" that we have observed in our communities and seemingly come to embrace as ""THE NORM"" when as Ras Baraka; (son of the Poet Laureate Amiri Baraka), Principle of Central H.S. in Newark, NJ and Newark City Councilman says ""YOU THINK THIS IS NORMAL....WELL IT AIN'T NORMAL, IT'S ABNORMAL""

Finally, Janks casts a new charge in the arena of the dire need now to start educating MALES on the repatriation back into their families and not only bonding naturally with sons but learning more clearly the role that they play in the lives of their daughters. There is a void in this area that needs to be served and Janks has boldy walked in it. Once you see DEAR DADDY, you will dare I say heed the same charge and start doing your part to fill the void in your family and community ALSO.

MEN & WOMEN.....do yourself a favor.......get this DVD.",1320105600,4,2741,5.044150110375276
4857786,4,B005Q12ZG0,Its a must see!! The family system is struggling in America today & I believe this documentary will open the eyes of many people. This documentary is based on several women from the Washington DC area who grew up without their fathers. They talk about how it has effected them.,1320105600,,277,4.56
4857787,5,B005Q12ZG0,I just watched this film last night and I was compelled to comment.  Every young lady who did not grow up with a father NEEDS to see this.  Many young ladies have unsettled emotions that THEY DON'T understand.  This film puts it in perspective.  Janks Morton's previous films were very good as well but this is the first one for young ladies and it is long overdue.  Thanks Mr. Morton for putting the spotlight on this issue that so many women don't acknowledge.  I cannot wait to see the next installment as I think resolution tactics are essential.,1319500800,3,550,4.561224489795919
4857788,5,B005Q12ZG0,"Janks helps us to face head-on the impact of the absent father. This is another great effort of a man gifted for purpose! Not only should those directly impacted (fatherless or the abesent father) watch, but society as a whole because this issue actually impacts cross-culturally. Thanks, Janks for another work that uproots and serves as prevention and to strengthen families!

4857789,2,B005Q12ZG0,"I am pleased with the content, style and purpose of this documentary and effort of Mr. Morton. I can utilize this film in my profession of Counseling African American males in the Criminal Justice System. I would classify this effort as a ""Victim Impact"" awareness film. I hope Vol II has more substance with respect to more in-depth interviews with women and girls who continue to struggle in their relationships even though they are no longer dependent on their mothers or guardians for support. How this issue has affected them in other areas of life and interpersonal skills. This is a great film to just get the dialogue started which is much needed in the Black Community. Looking forward to volume II.

4857790,4,B005Q12ZG0,If you've had the misfortune of growing up without a father. You can relate the gambit of emotions expressed by the young ladies in this documentary.,1368144000,,149,4.769230769230769
4857791,5,B005Q12ZG0,This movie is a real eye-opener. It should be required viewing for every single mom & daughter.  Part 2 needs to include tips for reconciliation.,1366848000,,145,4.8
4857792,5,B005Q12ZG0,"all of my siblings have different fathers...all of which are just sperm donors who have done nothing in our lives.

This film triggered emotions in my sister and i that I didn't know I had buried for so many years. This film is real, raw, uncut, and pure emotions. Lots of women are broken hearted because of fatherlessness.

Watch this documentary with a group of girl friends, or formerly abused women and have group discussions about this. Also, read the book Whatever Happened to Daddy's Little Girl by Jonetta Harris. It is definitely life changing.",1359676800,,554,4.821052631578947
4857793,4,B005Q12ZG0,"Serendipity of timing!!  At age 45, I finally sat down and wrote my father a letter about our shaky relationship.  He has yet to respond--except to share the letter with my brother who then, in solidarity with my father, is giving me the silent treatment. Strange that I had to write a letter because over the years, my father outright refused and often attacked us daughters for daring to speak anything other than praise about him. The 3 of us daughters face the possibility that the situation is hopeless. He refuses to hear, only preach in self defense because he feels entitled to automatic honor and respect.

No matter what becomes of my letter, I can testify that having written it and knowing that he read it has changed my life. I spoke my truth and released the burden of those words I had never before been allowed to articulate. I feel like I finally made my life ""real"" because paper and pen allowed me to speak.

If there is a part 2 of this project, I would be so grateful if the issue of communication between parents and children was addressed.  Like me, several of the girls on the film have given up on fathers because the fathers won't SEE them and the refuse to HEAR them. While I am not sure of what will happen in my situation, these young women deserve a far better prospect than I.

Like a woman on the film stated, it isn't about blame.  Still, for angry, guilt-ridden fathers, they cannot trust such assertion.  They know they are wrong, but hearing such means they have to own it and so they do whatever they can to silence dialogue.  How can this gap be filled?  How can we support fathers in the process of showing them the significance of ""seeing"" and ""hearing"" their daughters?",1357344000,,1710,4.487096774193549
4857794,5,B005Q12ZG0,I was a little disappointed at the film but it is a good beginning to a dialogue that needs to happen.,1353715200,,102,3.9047619047619047
4857795,5,B005Q12ZG0,"this documentary was trult inspirational and needed to be done, so that other girls can see what others go through. Many people out there are truly blessed to at least have their fathers there for them sometimes, but when girls do not have them, you can feel and see the hurt and I can relate.
Thanks for such a good topic for me to share with my students.",1339977600,,356,4.25
4857796,5,B005Q12ZG0,"This documentary caused me to drop many tears, and to understand many of my personal issues. This documentary has helped me to find closure and to build enough courage and initiative to reconcile a relationship with my father. I eagerly await the release of  Volume 2.

mother and father? Is the war with black men and black women, or do we rise above the
ignorance to heal our children. WATCH THE FILM, Mr. Morton has a talent that brings

4857798,4,B005Q12ZG0,"Wo[...] growing up as a fatherless child, I related so much to these broken young women. This documentary has moved me in ways I can't even begin to explain. I cried because I felt the pain that we share as that little girl living without a male to teach us what a real man is suppose to be. Amazing work Janks, I will definitely tell my friends about this.",1322352000,,357,4.188405797101449
4857799,5,B005Q12ZG0,"This dvd touches on so many issues and exposes topics that have been swept under the rug within the African American culture. Janks has a gift, and the only way to see it, is to view this dvd and watch how he gets each and every participant to open up and express innermost feelings. This is a must see!",1321401600,3,303,4.1525423728813555
8482834,3,B005Q12ZG0,"I appreciate the film maker for taking the time to address such a serious issue and I do like the documentary as it is an eye opener for some. I would love to see this more in depth and truly soul searching. This documentary stayed above the surface and was packaged well enough to say ok.

Finding the true grit of the heartache of fatherless daughters really had lots of facets that again can be expound upon, although I don't think that was the aim here.",1521590400,,457,4.313953488372093
