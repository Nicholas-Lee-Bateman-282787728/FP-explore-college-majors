7976186,3,B00007G1X0,"There are three qualities I rate in a documentary:

A. Quality of the Host/interviewees....3 stars

B. Quality of Graphics...4 stars

C. Quality of Information...2 stars

Some of the material seemed dumbed down, not terribly probing or well delivered. Some of the topics that I had some knowledge about, I felt like somebody was telling me a joke, but leaving off the punchline, like the whole discussion about the presence of Helium-3 on the moon, which constitutes a future fuel source...but why? They could have spent 5 minutes explaining the future of nuclear fusion (if there really is one)...not just saying Helium-3 is a future energy source. Overall, the documentary was somewhat broad, but quite shallow, sort of Mars for Star Trek fans. I did like it, but might buy something else if I had a do-over.",1172275200,,810,4.9338235294117645
