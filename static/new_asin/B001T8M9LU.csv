3788572,3,B001T8M9LU,"So back in 2007 I bought the Original ""Unsolved Mysteries: Ghosts"" DVD Set ( 4 Discs, 6 Hours ). Since Disc 2 of my set had flaws ( a little predictable, after 5 long years and numerous hours spent in a DVD player ), I decided to buy this Set containing only Disc 1 and 2 of the original Set. Even if this set only contains 2 discs instead of 4 I have to admit that this is a very good collection of ghost stories. On this 2-Disc collection you'll find some very interesting segments: ""Queen Mary Ghost"", ""The Entity"", ""Resurrection Mary"", the case of Theresita Basa, ""Ghost Lights"", ""Civil War Ghosts"", ""Ghost Blimp"", and many others. So for less than 15$ I was satisfied, and since the original 4-Disc collection is difficult to find I think this set is a very good buy. After all UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is one of the greatest TV shows ever produced.

Here's the problem: I have read that they won't release a Volume 2. This is really disappointing. They did the same thing with the Boxset about Bizarre murders, they only released Volume 1 and they won't release Volume 2.
I am aware that In late 2010, First Look Studios ceased operations and declared bankruptcy. However the new owner, Millenium Entertainment, can't release new Boxsets !? The most frustrating part of all this is the fact they, the producers or whoever made the DVDs, have decided they won't release any other Unsolved Mysteries Boxset in the near future. Unsolved Mysteries recorded more than 250 episodes, there's hundreds and hundreds of fascinating Murder cases that will never be released on DVD, they could have released at least six or seven 4 discs Boxset about murder cases. Or what about a Boxset about Missing people ?? Sadly there's enough segments to release a 6 hours DVD set, it would have been amazing, without a doubt a must-own. Thank god for Youtube, where you can find most of the episodes.",1349740800,3,1879,4.642642642642643
3788573,5,B001T8M9LU,"Okay let me first start by saying if you do not remember Unsolved Mysteries then maybe you're too young or weren't born yet;either way now is your chance to see some really strange things happening. Now the Unsolved Mysteries ghost edition (2 cd's) is a segment of many from what the television show broadcasted. Simply,this ghost edition is just creepy to watch and not to mention the background music along with host Robert Stack voice gives it a scarier feeling. So overall, this is a great dvd to watch with friends,family etc.",1345161600,6,531,4.782608695652174
3788574,5,B001T8M9LU,"The selections of ""Unsolved Mysteries Scariest Ghost Stories"" are just as enjoyable today as they were when they first aired on TV. Robert Stack was a good MC and really brought the stories back to life.",1330300800,5,203,4.666666666666667
3788575,5,B001T8M9LU,"Loved it! These episodes were more interesting than expected. Very convincing stories, yet as usual they are also cross examined by Robert Stack. Loved it!!",1323043200,6,156,5.28
3788576,5,B001T8M9LU,"This set is the same as the previous release of Ghost but just two dvds instead of four. Why? The people at Unsolved Mysteries should get there head out of there butts and released Best of Ghost Volume 2. They have plenty of material with over 16 seasons on tv, it'd be easy to make at more ghost story dvds. I enjoyed the original set but it wasn't scary as they claimed.",1254009600,15,372,4.180555555555555
3788577,5,B001T8M9LU,I love the unsolved mystery's collection of Ghosts and others. Only thing I will say is if you already have the unsolved mystery's ghost collection that was a four disc set this is two of those four disc's they are not new or different.,1252886400,27,236,4.386363636363637

3788582,3,B001T8M9LU,"I can remember 3 compelling ghost stories that did not make the set (for some reason), yet the set includes two segments that have nothing to do with ghosts:  Ghost Blimp and Ghost Lights.  This looks like some quick-and-dirty money-making scheme.  And I mean quick!  Like someone typed ""ghost"" in the Unsolved Mysteries database and blindly threw in every segment with ghost in the title.",1374537600,3,389,4.938461538461539

3788585,5,B001T8M9LU,"No other true story show comes close to the original Unsolved Mysteries with Robert Stack.  As soon as the creepy theme song started, I could feel the goose bumps start. Such a well-produced series, and guaranteed to convince you there are forces out there we know very little about.  Fascinating and addictive to watch.  Highly recommended.",1361404800,6,341,5.053571428571429

8340814,5,B001T8M9LU,"I was a huge fan of the Robert Stack ""Unsolved Mysteries"" episodes when I was younger. I was absolutely thrilled to find these episodes on DVD and couldn't wait to get them all. I remembered many of the episodes from my youth and others were new to me. These are great for binge watching or reminiscing. There were a few episodes that I really wish they'd included, but maybe there will be more to come!  I'd highly recommend this set to any fan of the paranormal or maybe someone who liked this show as much as I did!",1445904000,,518,4.285714285714286
