the story is not overtly complex, but it is just nice.
I like it.
it is gentle and simple- and good for the whole family.

and it is like an hour long!

it doesn't really teach anything specific, except maybe not to be grumpy at the holidays, and to always believe.. but either way, it is just nice.

OH, and there are bonus episodes on the disc- including the OTHER christmas episode + more.

My 2 3/4 year old daughter loves it.  I can watch it with her and enjoy it.  This, in my opinion, is not quite as good as Franklin and The Green Knight (which contains songs that the characters sing) but it is really sweet and worth purchasing.",1368662400,,398,4.197368421052632

7972716,5,B00006RJDJ,"This is my lil guys favorite 'Franklin' show by far! And a holiday favorite we watch every year now! We discovered this when my son was 3 yrs old, and he really enjoyed it, even though we didn't know the Franklin show or characters very well then. He was captured by the sweet, calm storyline. Now at 6 yrs old, he still enjoys seeing it, and as a mom I've enjoyed it a lot too. It's about working together as a family, loving your siblings and the fun, magical parts of Christmas! The colorful, soft, good ol' cartoon animation (not computer generated) gives it an even warmer holiday feel. The story is perfect for any age, boys or girls, with no scary parts or scary characters. It will quickly become a holiday favorite your family can watch year after year together!",1439856000,,771,4.475177304964539
