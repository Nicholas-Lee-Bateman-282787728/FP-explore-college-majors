8604354,1,B00EDVMQZO,"Extremely disappointed in my purchase. My fourteen month old loves the shapes and colors songs and I was initially going to purchases that DVD however, I found the season one option and figured the shapes and colors would be on the DVD. The description was vague and uninformative and so I assumed shapes and colors would be on it. The description for the Season 1 DVD says six 30 minute episodes but there is no breakdown of what the episodes are. Upon reviewing the DVD I am extremely disappointed to find that colors and shapes are not featured.",1449878400,12,548,4.6020408163265305

8604356,4,B00EDVMQZO,"This documentary, seems to have several different names it could be known buy depending on the source you find it at. The standard name is ""Racing Green"", however there is another DVD with that name also. The front of the DVD case has the description that say ""Alaska to Argentina: Racing Green, The First Electric Car to Drive the Pan-American Highway - A World Record"". However the project itself and the movies official website call it ""Racing Green Endurance"". Racing Green, itself is a challenge by a UK college for builders to come up with zero emission race cars. This documentary was originally shown on BBC television in eight parts. Each part has the same opening and closing scenes, and then it tells what happened on the pervious episode. The car was followed by a support van and motorcycles, that filmed the documentary, as well as camera on the car, and interviews at various stops along the journey.

In the first episode, a group students from Imperial College in London, begin to convert a gasoline racing car into a prototype electric car, with a range of over 500 kilometers. It follows the graduate students in the early stages of converting the car, and preparations they go through to get the car running. Because of the car's low ground clearance the first issue they have to deal with is a two inch gutter, coming out of the garage. After which they find the car won't accelerate properly. They discover it is magnetic interference with all the electrical bits working at the same time. Next they have a software problem while on a test track. They then go for their road certification, and with a few adjustments of the breaks they manage to pass the tests. After that they test the cars range by driving from London to Paris. Six of the teams members then fly off to Chena Hot Springs Resort, Alaska to begin the drive down to Argentina. They power the car here by the Geothermal generators that are turned by the hot springs. After leaving the hot springs their next challenge becomes heavy rain for the open topped race car.

The second episode starts with the team driving through the rain, for which they aren't sure if it is safe to be in the car. They then find out the next night that the car hasn't been charged properly and they try to figure out why this happened. Finding that the power source relies on how many other things are, or aren't, plugged in at the trailer park. Here a new motorcycle support driver joins the convoy. They then enter Canada, shortly afterward the new guy needs to leave. That night two of their three battery chargers breakdown, they try to fix them but are unsuccessful. To make their deadline of a press event, they decide to have the car towed to charge it faster. They then return to where they were on the route, so they can drive the complete Pan-American highway with the car solo. They also get pulled over by the police for the first time, and have their legal paperwork checked. They then find the tow charging has caused one of their fuses to blowout. Shortly after the press event in Vancouver, they get pulled over again, which becomes a running theme through much of the film. This time the brake lights weren't working but they fake it by turning on the headlights, which gets them out of the scrape. They then get a new support vehicle. The new parts for the broken chargers arrives but end up causing a short, permanently breaking the chargers. They crossover into the USA and find a charging spot at a five star hotel.

The third episode starts with the crew waking up in a car park, while their car is being charged at a five star hotel. At Wilsonville, Oregon they are lent two new power supplies that will help them charge their car. Once in California they get to test out some electric Zero Motorcycles. And allow a skateboarder to ride along by holding onto the tail fin of the car, in a 'Back to the Future' type moment. They then examine the undercarriage of the car, as the 'new guy' support motorcyclist returns from Hawaii. They next stop to check out some elephant seals on the beech. Another police investigation takes place at night, and they give one of the officers a ride. Shortly after getting into Las Vegas, the support motorcycle gets hit from behind while waiting at a stoplight. But nobody gets injured. They find a hotel/casino to charge the car while they then go out for a night of sight seeing. When they get to Austin Texas, three of the team members give a lecture for one of their sponsors. The next day, the 'new guy', and another team member leave the convoy to return to their families. They talk with a family from Mexico that warns of the violence and criminal organizations that will be just over the boarder. And then shortly before reaching the USA/Mexico boarder one of the car's vibration dampeners breaks.

Episode four begins with the team at a local garage trying to find a way to fix their broken shock absorber. They find someone that cuts off the broken bit, and reattaches the remaining bit, and get it back into working order. They enter Mexico through Eagle Pass, and are almost immediately pulled over by a news crew, and the police. The other shock absorber shortly afterwards decides to break also. They find a trailer towing service and get the car to the nearest local town. They get the absorber repaired, and then meet two new motorcycle support members of the team that came from Montana. On their way to Mexico City they also blow a fuse, but they make it to their press event on time. While in Mexico City they experience their first tropical rain storm, and get themselves two new shock absorbers. Just outside of the town of Oaxaca they run into a road that is blocked by a bus worker's strike. The only place they can find to plug in at in this town is at a local power station. There is another rain storm, before they finally arrive at a wind power generating farm. Two of the team members get to go up inside the wind generators, and get to see the view from top of a generator. They pass into Guatemala, and learn a bit about its history with the USA.

Episode five begins with the team in Guatemala, they give a talk in a small parking area, then get a police escort to its capital city, over a lot of speed bumps. They arrive at Guatemala City, and give a press conference, then it begins to rain. They try to water proof the car as much as possible, as they drive the entire journey to El Salvador in the rain. They stop for a short time, and then get another police escort. They then pass through Honduras, Nicaragua, without anything eventful happening. They then visit a Geothermal power plant in Costa Rica. On their way to Panama they come across a overturned fuel truck on the side of the road. Later they hit a bump, and their crash sensor gets triggered and it shuts off the power to the car. They then get a police escort into Panama City. Once there they get to charge the car from the hydropower of the Panama Canal. They have some more press event, and then have troubles getting the car shipped to South America, as there are no roads to Colombia through the dense jungle ahead. They stop at the police station, and then hurry to the shipping yards, to get the car into a shipping container. The car's shipping is delayed a week. When the ship arrived they have difficulties getting it back, and there is something wrong with the car and it has a fire.

Episode six starts with the team getting the car out of Colombian customs, then finding out that a pin connection and sea water caused the fire. They stop at a local college and repair the car so they can ""drive every inch of the Pan-American highway"". After six days they get it fixed. And get more police escorts. They pass another semi truck that was over turned, and pass by a place in the road that have washed away. Next they have several mountains that the car must climb, all done on one charge. Along the way they see a bicyclist hanging on the the back of a semi's trailer while going down the road. They stop at Bogota as they plan their journey over the remaining mountains, another press event, and more working on the car to get it's brake lights working again. Before leaving their they think their small battery charger has failed, but instead they find it had a bad wire, then a fuse has blown, and they find the car's body work has been rubbing up against another wire. They show off the car in Pasto and then head into Ecuador where a police escort are waiting. They then stop along the side of the road, and the police let them try their weapons.

Episode seven begins with the team at a race track. After a wipeout they allow a Formula 3 driver to test the car at top speed. While in Quito they give a talk at a college, and in a demonstration they have a crash. It is later hinted at, that there had been some drinking before the event, ""this time we'll drink after the press event and not before"", and that they had learned their lesson. In about six days they get the crash box, nose cone, left front suspension, and fiberglass pieces repaired. They then enter Peru, and stop at the town of Piura and help out a volunteer group with teaching some children, and see the poverty of the town. They pass the deserts of the coast and stop at Lima where they have a small accident, and manage to get the car fixed before a press event there. At a town of Ica they stop and try to find why the car is using to much energy.

Episode eight starts with the team finding their energy loss problem. They find it was a fault in the battery management system, and they find another problem while the car is in the desert. They find that they missed putting a cable on earlier. They next pass into Chile where they stop at the European Southern Observatory. A place where some scenes from the movie Quantum of Solace where filmed. They then get a tour of the observatory. They next stop at Santiago and have a gasoline powered go-kart race. They later enter Argentina as they pass through rain and snow, and skid off the road while trying to avoid a hole in the road. From this, they find that they have broken two shock absorbers, and ripped the diffuser. Their next stop is Comodoro where they repair the car. Shortly after that they have to travel along a gravel road. After a short stay in Rio Grande and checking the car for vibration damage, they continue to Ushuaia their last stop, on a journey that took them 70 driving days, in an electric car.
