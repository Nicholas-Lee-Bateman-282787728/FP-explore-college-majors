8349813,5,B0023R322G,I almost don't miss Paul Weller if I just close my eyes and listen.  I actually do like the more solid and mature musicianship on this that the Jam  didn't always produce in their live gigs.  Id does miss some raw energy of the old JAM but then these aren't the young lads who could go all night non stop :)  I listen to this often!,1513814400,,332,3.984848484848485

8349815,5,B0023R322G,"All I have to say is Mr Russell Hastings you have made a very happy man feel a little old!  The Jam was the first band I ever saw live at the age of 15, and 32 years later that memory is still vivid, and I still listen to and play Jam numbers.  Well Mr Hastings thank you for being a part of this and in my humble opinion you blow away a certain Mr Weller.

And on a final note is there any chance of you guys visiting Central Florida?!?!?!",1424908800,,440,3.8131868131868134
8349816,5,B0023R322G,"Simply amazing.  I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this.  As a devote follower of the Jam, I was a bit skeptical (the Jam without Weller?) But the albums is great. When listening to Ghosts, I actually thought ""this song is so much better when song by someone who can actually sing"".",1403568000,,284,4.339622641509434
8349817,5,B0023R322G,"Stack this release square against Dig The New Breed and the ton of other bootleg albums from back in the day and nearly any fan would have to declare, vocally and musicianship wise, From The Jam blows 'em all away.  Makes me wish these cats would have covered the entire catalog by The Jam, live... Russell Hastings does an impressive job at managing the lead vocals, almost making you say -  ""Paul Who...""",1384819200,,406,4.5479452054794525
8349818,5,B0023R322G,"I saw F.T.J. when they played Portland in 2007... As a huge fan of The Jam I wasn't sure what to expect from a reunion without Paul Weller. I had waited 25 years to see them and this would ""have to do"", or so I thought... Well, from the moment the band started playing, my jaw hit the floor and stayed there for the next 90 minutes. They were tight, energetic and the Foxton/Buckler rhythm section(one of the best ever in my opinion) was as solid as a rock. Russell Hastings manages to pull off the impossible(replacing PW) and exceeds any and all expectations. He had big shoes to fill - he did - and now owns them. He plays and sings so much like Weller it's astounding... if your eyes were closed you might not even be able to tell the difference.
  Now about this double dvd set - disc one is a sold-out London show and is extremely well done. The sound is especially good, with Bruce's bass coming through like it should. The video is great too, thankfully lacking that all too prevalent ""short attention span"" quick cutting that has marred too many live dvds, such as the last SLF dvd. Great set choice, although I really would have loved to see ""Funeral Pyre"" included. Disc two contains interviews, and while I have not watched all of them, It's good to see the sincere love and respect expressed from all involved for The Jam's music, legacy, and fans... especially in light of the somewhat dismissive tone Weller tends to take regarding the band that made him famous. Gorgeous packaging as well, including a full color booklet of photos. I cannot recommend this dvd enough... for Jam fans it's absolutely mandatory.",1260057600,5,1625,4.5426621160409555
