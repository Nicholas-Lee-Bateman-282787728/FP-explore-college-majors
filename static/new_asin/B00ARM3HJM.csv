The program is really entertaining in the fact that it's completely CGI, and is almost one single shot, and gives new information about the inside of our planet.",1470182400,,288,4.666666666666667

My son noticed right away. Took a while to find a Dvd of it even from Nat Geo,but I did finally find it at Amazon,once again Amazon comes thru. Thank you.",1361577600,,545,4.3431372549019605
