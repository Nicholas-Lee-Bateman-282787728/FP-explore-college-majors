3033866,5,B000YPUFAQ,"I found watching Resident Evil trilogy on Blu-ray was very enjoyable. You don't need to be a big fan of the games to enjoy the movies. The films had enough of the right stuff to make it worthwhile buying this boxset. The only downside is when watching blu-wizard I believe that when it switches to a special feature you lose a bit of the film, for the length of the extra you just watched.",1204502400,,389,4.27027027027027
3033867,5,B000YPUFAQ,"I enjoyed all three parts of the resident evil trilogy. every one is superb in sound. the experience of all the sounddetails is phenomenal. the blu ray picture is best in the second part.
the only bad thing: why did they ""soften"" milla jovovich's face in the third part???

have fun and enjoy - a brilliant rollercoaster ride with zombies!",1203638400,,339,4.65

3033870,5,B000YPUFAQ,"I have the first two on DVD but when i saw a box set of all three, I had to have it. The BLU-ray disks are the best, picture and sound great on my EPSON EMP TW700 LCD projecter with 120"" screen, it was better than the movies exept for the popcorn. After watching the 3rd movie for the 5th time I had to watch all of them again followed by all of Milla Jovovich's SIFI movies",1201392000,,374,3.8701298701298703
3033871,5,B000YPUFAQ,"I will not type in terms of reviewing the movies, as many have done.  I will say that from watching the regular DVD versions to these Blu Ray ones, BLOWN AWAY is the best way to describe this trilogy in terms of visual/audio difference.  I can honestly say that I feel I can grab the T-virus vaccines in the beginning of the first movie.  The sound, wow, is simply awesome.  From the booming explosions to the ""tink"" of gun shells hitting the floor, it is incredible.  The downside...I will be spending a lot of money upgrading to Blu ray versions some select DVDs in my collection :) .",1200700800,,586,4.388888888888889
3033872,4,B000YPUFAQ,"I remember back in 2002 when Resident Evil came out how skeptical I was about a video game transfer to the big screen. But you gotta hand it to Writer/Director Paul Anderson on that one; he made a great, Action- Horror film.

Then along came Resident Evil: Apocalypse (RE2) in 2004. Anderson wrote the script, but turned the directing reins over to noob Alexander Witt...and you see Witt's inexperience all over the movie. RE2 added an amateurish hokeyness that wasn't present in the original.

In 2007 the series returns to straight-up Action - Horror with Resident Evil: Extinction (RE3). RE3 is not as dark and creepy as RE1, but it's a lot better than RE2. Anderson again wrote the script, but relied on vet Russ Mulcahy (remember the cult 80s hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B00005RYL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>?) to direct. For RE3, Mulcahy went back to a lot of the basics that made the original so good.

RE1 and RE3 have good old fashion scares, tons of action and stories that never get boring. RE2 was entertaining and had its own share of action, but the story and the 'horror' lacked compared to 1 & 3.

The story is pretty consistent throughout all three movies. The deadly T-Virus is accidentally (or not) released by the Umbrella Corporation, and it's up to Milla Jovovich to save the world from its effects: zombies, unthinkable mutations (man and animal alike) and the psychotic minds of the Umbrella Corp.

It's certainly not necessary to watch all three to understand what's going on in the individual releases. In fact, you don't even need to watch them chronologically. But if you're into the Action - Horror genre, and you haven't seen the first two, I recommend just starting from the beginning and enjoy the ride.",1200614400,5,1815,5.138983050847457

3033905,5,B000YPUFAQ,"I'm embarrassed by how much I enjoy these moves. The first and third are fantastic, the second one is good. I bought the trilogy because though I already owned all three movies, one of them was missing it's case, and I am OCD like that.",1467936000,,236,4.266666666666667
3033906,5,B000YPUFAQ,"This is the box set of the three original Resident Evil Movies.  There is another set that have the 4th and 5th movies called The Resident Evil Collection.  Just be aware that the other is out there, and if you are looking for that, this is not it.

Resident Evil really started the resurgence in Zombie movies/TV shows.  When the original came out there had not really been anything in the genre for a fairly long while.  And while I would not say any of the movies are as good as The Walking Dead, or even IZombie, if you accept them for what they are, and what they are not, they are enjoyable action packed movies.

Of course, the series is based on the video game of the same name.  The first movie is actually a prequel to the events of the original game, where we learn exactly how the T-Virus that causes the zombie epidemic is released.  The second movie is set shortly after the events of the game and really center on the effort to control the outbreak, and the third movie, Extinction, is set many years after the outbreak when the epidemic has spread.

The main character of the films is Alice, played by Milla Jovovich.  The other films have rotated supporting cast and characters, but hers is the constant, and she is essentially superhuman after being exposed to the virus.  She is intent on taking down the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus, and the various levels of bad guys.  You really do not need to know much about the plot from there, aside from the fact that it involves evading zombies that are becoming more and more powerful.  I have never played the games, so I am not sure how much they differ or how much people who are hardcore fans of the game would be upset by what has been changed, but like I said earlier if you accept that it is an action movie based on killing zombies, and will never win any awards for acting, directing or writing, although for the genre I think all are fine in the movies, you can enjoy them.

The movies look and sound great on Blu-Ray.  The special features are very similar for each movie.  At least 1 commentary track on the movies, deleted scenes and a lot of behind the scenes and making of features.  If you like listening to the commentary tracks, the ones Milla Jovovich does are pretty hilarious.  She totally does not take herself seriously, but you can tell she was very into the movies and what she was doing.  All in all you get a good hour plus of bonus features for each movie.  If you are a fan of action/horror movies they are worth checking out.",1461110400,5,2535,4.399141630901288

These films are action packed and really fun to watch if you like zombie apocolypse movies.

3034050,5,B000YPUFAQ,"Actually, at the time of this writing, five of the six films in this enjoyable series have been released; the sixth and final film is currently in production and is scheduled for release in 2015. I will definitely add the sixth film to my DVD collection that already contains the first five.

As a published horror author myself, one who has little tolerance for zombie stories/films, I have to admit these films are an exception. Much of the credit goes to Milla Jovovich as Alice, the lead in all six films. The zombies are always there, but the acting is excellent and the storyline intriguing. The supporting actors are nearly all great too. Sorry Oded didn't make it to the fourth film as there seemed to be a budding love interest between him and Alice.

As to this trilogy of the first three films, the first is not in the same widescreen as the other two, but I didn't notice any difference, thus I don't regret getting the three as a set. The extras are all included for each film as well. Not to mention it's cheaper to buy the three DVDs together than separately.

This is a good deal and the movies are worth watching again, despite parts being familiar. I enjoy this series and hate to see it end. I'm sure Milla will do more good stuff, however. She is amazing! The only film she starred in that I really disliked was the Joan of Arc ""bio""; Milla's acting was great, but the film is depressing, ugly, dark and miserable to sit through (not Milla's fault, however!).",1395014400,,1479,4.4907063197026025

However as the sequels come out, it just seems like the story line is repeating itself.  The directors, writers, and producers have a so;lid foundation with this story, maybe they should start thinking up better story lines rather than just repeating: Alice finds herself in trouble, impossibly gets out using some very cool martial arts, which is impossible for mere mortals, and then faces a stronger, faster, and uglier monster.

If you love Resident Evil ""so much"", then you'll probably love it to bits (and think i am a moron). If you are looking for great Blu Ray footage then there is so much more to choose from now, buying something else is probably a good idea (i bought this years ago when there was far less BluRay available).",1367366400,,556,4.138888888888889

3034088,5,B000YPUFAQ,"Follow Alice through her ordeal of the Umbrella Corporation's demise. Watch her grow from a meek and mild girly girl into the mean lean fighting machine that she was meant to be. Watch her friends come and go and come again (not always in the live way either).

Although these movies are ""loosely"" based on the Game series by Capcom, and notice that I say ""loosely""!, they are far enough removed to be enjoyed by both fans of the Resident Evil series and non fans alike. there is just enough references to the game to keep the viewer interested and looking saying ""did you see that from the game?""

This may not be the best zombie series out there on the market but I will keep going back for more of that Kick Ass action from Milla as long as she is willing to keep making Resident Evil movies.

The only thing I want to make a negative comment about is that they should wait till they finish making the series before they bring out box sets, but this is not just an issue for the Resident evil Series, that goes for all series!",1360540800,,1029,4.293814432989691

Creepily close the to the rumored events happening a few years ago at the secret Darpa facilities.  To be viewed as a war plans scenario of what is coming.",1358035200,,362,4.343283582089552

I'm not going to write a blow by blow description about these films.  That defeats the purpose of buying & watching it.  That's why they include the synopsis with the particulars of the film.

So on the first rainy Saturday after I received the Resident Evil Trilogy on blu-ray, there we all were plopped down on the sofa waiting for the blu-ray player to begin the movie.  When the movie started it was almost like seeing it for the first time.  Rather than hearing moans and groans from the kids about how they were bored I was hearing ew, gross, did you see that?  I have to admit I felt like I was seeing the zombies for the first time and they were very detailed and gross!  The sounds were much more ""alive"" if you could say that.  Everything sounded and looked more ewwy and gooey.  8 (3 kids and mine) thumbs up!",1340323200,,835,4.2075471698113205

The more blood and guts there are in a movie, the more entertaining it is for me. The storyline isn't horrible either. All in all, I rate it 5 stars b/c I like the blood, guts and action present in the movies. The third (Extinction) seems to be less dark than the first, to me, but I thoroughly enjoyed the addition of the infected foul.

3034207,4,B000YPUFAQ,"My girlfriend and I like 3d movies and wanted to see the latest installment of this ongoing story in 3d. She had never seen the first three so I ordered the trilogy set so we could watch them together before seeing the fourth one. Surprisingly she loved them as much as I did and is now a fan of Alice. Alice being the main character in the series.
This is one of the few times where the sequels keep evolving with the players. We both felt the stories and performances get better with each film, and although this review is for just the trilogy set, after seeing the fourth one I will be ordering it soon. If you are a Jovovich fan, an action fan or just a fan of the ""Resident Evil"" movies, I recommend adding this set to your collection.

Movie wise, there is alot to  be desired. The first's SFX are laughable, a great argument for practical vs CGI effects, anyday of the week. Though its not as bad with the other movies
The story is pretty nonexistent. Luckily, after the first one they dropped and character development, focused on fighting, sfx and one liners to add to the cheese factor. and stretched out the 25 minutes worth of story to about 100 minutes. Amazingly, by doing this the movies improve, and a march more enjoyable to watch. Running Dialogue with friends is required.  I got the boxset when it was 25 bucks deal of the day. And don't feel too ripped off about it.  36 bucks I don't know know though... that might be pushing it....

Resident Evil Apocalypse, however, is just horrible. It is great to see Jill Valentine stepping in but the movie is comparable to watching paint dry.

3034245,5,B000YPUFAQ,"Even though the Amazon listing says there are 4 discs mine only had 3 and the packaging is designed to hold only 3 discs. The box even says 3 disc set on the side. Which is fine it has what you want the 3 movies. I did submit to Amazon that they change the listing.

I almost didn't buy this set because of an other review saying that one of the movies was full screen, which I hate, having all widescreen TV's, but the Apocalypse DVD has both wide and full screen on it, so I was a happy camper. All 3 are anamorphic widescreen. The first movie is 1.85:1 so it will fill a widescreen TV. Apocalypse and Extinction are both 2.40:1 so you will still get black bars on the top and bottom even on a widescreen TV.

If you're like me and own a Sony 400 disc or Pioneer 301 disc DVD changer you'll like that it does have title text and a jacket picture on all 3 discs, so you won't have to type in the name or make a backup just so you can add the name to the disc.

3034249,2,B000YPUFAQ,"I ordered this boxed set of DVDs for my husband's birthday.  I heard a rattle when I unpacked it, and checked on the discs.  The whole package is cheaply made, thin paper cardboard.  It was almost impossible to open without causing damage to the paper box.  I don't usually have to use a steak knife to open a DVD package.

One DVD is on the first side of the plastic box, and the other 2 are layered over each other on the second side, very poor design.  The disc on the top layer was loose. It wouldn't stay in place at all.

Then, I noticed as I was logging the movies (we own about 1000 DVDs, so I keep a list or we'd own about 1500 due to duplications), was that 2 of the discs are widescreen, and 1 is full screen!  Not my husband's preference, and now it's too late to order something else.

The only reason I didn't give this a 1 star review was:

1) I managed to get the overlapping disc to stay in place, finally.

2) A preview disc for movie 4 was included, as a ""bonus"".  Of course, movie 4 was released 12/2008, so that's not really a big deal anymore.",1238803200,9,1065,4.091787439613527

3034259,3,B000YPUFAQ,"I watched all 3 Blu-Rays in order in one night. My review deals primarily with the third movie as it closes the trilogy (for now).

The first film is an exciting, scary movie that's somewhat similar to the games but different from most zombie movies. Zombie humans, zombie dogs, and a computer-generated Licker all threaten the heroes, who are investigating a viral outbreak in an underground research lab. The movie introduces butt-kicking Alice (played by Milla Jovovich), who is not in the games. She ends up being the glue that holds this trilogy together as each film is quite different from the others.

2 remains my favorite because it's just the most fun. The comic relief is appreciated and I like some of the situations that occur, like the tense church scene. It's also the closest to the games out of the 3 movies. However the writing is dumb at times, such as the graveyard sequence and the climactic battle between Alice and Nemesis. The Nemesis monster as portrayed here is not a frightening villain. He just fights with guns and other weapons and his costume fails to impress. Still, look at this movie as a simple sci-fi action flick instead of horror and you'll probably enjoy it.

3 was a huge disappointment... Failing to explain the absence of two key characters from part 2 is really unsatisfying. The only possible conclusion within the logic of the movie's world is that they died, which is no fun at all. Then the post-apocalyptic setting - which would be fine for a zombie movie in general - doesn't work in the Resident Evil universe at all. So already it's just not Resident Evil any more. Throwing in the tyrant and the crows was a cool idea but it's too little too late. RE fans know those have been around since the timeline of RE1, so their introduction just further separates the continuity of the films and games.

The movie also commits the crime of killing off every likable character, leaving the audience with no one to attach themselves to. Videogame protagonist Claire Redfield is wasted in this movie, and Alice has become so alien that it's hard to worry about her.

And finally, Extinction's zombies look terrible. I know they were going for a sundrenched effect, but they still look like vomit. As I recall they also abandoned the CG-enhancement of the zombies (giving them transparent parts and such) that looked so cool in 1 & 2. Then the super zombies.... Oh man. Those fake eyebrows didn't look good in Buffy and Angel and they look even worse on brown zombies.

As a whole, this box-set represents a good value. The movies are so different, it's hard to give a strong thumbs up or down (hence my 3-star rating). The picture quality and sound are awesome. The extras are fairly significant, with deleted scenes, alternate endings, and loads of featurettes. If you're really into the Resident Evil movies this box is a great and affordable way to show off your HDTV and Blu-Ray player.",1216425600,,2932,4.716796875

I won't go into any further detail because whether you like a movie or not is subjective.  I'm sure you know what type of movies these are if you are considering purchasing them, and I would recommend them if you like horror/sci-fi/action adventure films.  I think the most important thing I could share with you is the picture quality of these blu-ray discs which is fantastic. They look great on a big screen hi-def tv and I would highly recommend them if that is what is most important to you.",1206316800,,590,4.394495412844036
3034265,5,B000YPUFAQ,"As a fan of the games since the first amazing one burst on to the scene,  seeing the first movie was an essential. It was very good, although at times I  was hoping it would stick to more of the game - but this is a different medium, and I  got used to it, and grew to love the movie - especially with the magical and inspired casting of MIlla Jovovich in the lead role !
Second film ' Apocalypse ' was initially disappointing - but having now seen it in Blu-ray Hi-Def. it seems like a different movie !
Compellingly watchable, it grabs hold of your attention from the start - and never let's go.
Having received the Blu-ray Trilogy from Amazon here, I  waited to see how film 3  would be....
And - just have to say that it's  the  BEST  yet !
New director, Russell Mulcahy - takes the post-apocalyptic theme with strong resonances of the second Mad Max movie - and injects amazing new inspiration into the story, the camera-work, special effects, make-up, costumes  etc
I  haven't enjoyed a movie as much for ages !
Obviously, there will be a sequel - and what's wrong with that ?
The Trilogy of films are  ALL  different - the first, essentially filmed indoors in dark and natural light; the second, filmed outside, mainly in the dark, and the third - filmed in Mexico in high heat and broad daylight. And - the zombies have moved on to a more advanced evolution -they're fast - and even more nasty and ugly-looking - amazing make-up !
And - as well as the gorgeous Milla who appears in 2  different forms - a  few other honeyz to excite the attention.
ALL round - highly impressive !
Now, I  just can't wait for the  4th !
Highly recommended.",1205193600,2,1646,4.330065359477124

It's not jaw-droppingly good like Spiderman 3, but they are definitely some of the better looking blus I own.  I'm particularly impressed with the details that comes out in the dark sequences in RE1 (which is a lot of the movie).  The special features are kind of thin, IMO, but it's better than some (Fifth Element, Black Hawk Down and Kingdom of Heaven, I'm looking at you!).

I will say that from watching the regular DVD versions to these Blu Ray ones, BLOWN AWAY is the best way to describe this trilogy in terms of visual/audio difference.  I can honestly say that I feel I can grab the T-virus vaccines in the beginning of the first movie.  The sound, wow, is simply awesome.  From the booming explosions to the ""tink"" of gun shells hitting the floor, it is incredible.

3268369,4,B000YPUFAQ,"I remember back in 2002 when Resident Evil came out how skeptical I was about a video game transfer to the big screen. But you gotta hand it to Writer/Director Paul Anderson on that one; he made a great, Action- Horror film.

Then along came Resident Evil: Apocalypse (RE2) in 2004. Anderson wrote the script, but turned the directing reins over to noob Alexander Witt...and you see Witt's inexperience all over the movie. RE2 added an amateurish hokeyness that wasn't present in the original.

In 2007 the series returns to straight-up Action - Horror with Resident Evil: Extinction (RE3). RE3 is not as dark and creepy as RE1, but it's a lot better than RE2. Anderson again wrote the script, but relied on vet Russ Mulcahy (remember the cult 80s hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B00005RYL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>?) to direct. For RE3, Mulcahy went back to a lot of the basics that made the original so good.

RE1 and RE3 have good old fashion scares, tons of action and stories that never get boring. RE2 was entertaining and had its own share of action, but the story and the 'horror' lacked compared to 1 & 3.

The story is pretty consistent throughout all three movies. The deadly T-Virus is accidentally (or not) released by the Umbrella Corporation, and it's up to Milla Jovovich to save the world from its effects: zombies, unthinkable mutations (man and animal alike) and the psychotic minds of the Umbrella Corp.

It's certainly not necessary to watch all three to understand what's going on in the individual releases. In fact, you don't even need to watch them chronologically. But if you're into the Action - Horror genre, and you haven't seen the first two, I recommend just starting from the beginning and enjoy the ride.",1200614400,5,1815,5.138983050847457

3268402,5,B000YPUFAQ,"I'm embarrassed by how much I enjoy these moves. The first and third are fantastic, the second one is good. I bought the trilogy because though I already owned all three movies, one of them was missing it's case, and I am OCD like that.",1467936000,,236,4.266666666666667
3268403,5,B000YPUFAQ,"This is the box set of the three original Resident Evil Movies.  There is another set that have the 4th and 5th movies called The Resident Evil Collection.  Just be aware that the other is out there, and if you are looking for that, this is not it.

Resident Evil really started the resurgence in Zombie movies/TV shows.  When the original came out there had not really been anything in the genre for a fairly long while.  And while I would not say any of the movies are as good as The Walking Dead, or even IZombie, if you accept them for what they are, and what they are not, they are enjoyable action packed movies.

Of course, the series is based on the video game of the same name.  The first movie is actually a prequel to the events of the original game, where we learn exactly how the T-Virus that causes the zombie epidemic is released.  The second movie is set shortly after the events of the game and really center on the effort to control the outbreak, and the third movie, Extinction, is set many years after the outbreak when the epidemic has spread.

The main character of the films is Alice, played by Milla Jovovich.  The other films have rotated supporting cast and characters, but hers is the constant, and she is essentially superhuman after being exposed to the virus.  She is intent on taking down the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus, and the various levels of bad guys.  You really do not need to know much about the plot from there, aside from the fact that it involves evading zombies that are becoming more and more powerful.  I have never played the games, so I am not sure how much they differ or how much people who are hardcore fans of the game would be upset by what has been changed, but like I said earlier if you accept that it is an action movie based on killing zombies, and will never win any awards for acting, directing or writing, although for the genre I think all are fine in the movies, you can enjoy them.

The movies look and sound great on Blu-Ray.  The special features are very similar for each movie.  At least 1 commentary track on the movies, deleted scenes and a lot of behind the scenes and making of features.  If you like listening to the commentary tracks, the ones Milla Jovovich does are pretty hilarious.  She totally does not take herself seriously, but you can tell she was very into the movies and what she was doing.  All in all you get a good hour plus of bonus features for each movie.  If you are a fan of action/horror movies they are worth checking out.",1461110400,5,2535,4.399141630901288

3268547,5,B000YPUFAQ,"Actually, at the time of this writing, five of the six films in this enjoyable series have been released; the sixth and final film is currently in production and is scheduled for release in 2015. I will definitely add the sixth film to my DVD collection that already contains the first five.

As a published horror author myself, one who has little tolerance for zombie stories/films, I have to admit these films are an exception. Much of the credit goes to Milla Jovovich as Alice, the lead in all six films. The zombies are always there, but the acting is excellent and the storyline intriguing. The supporting actors are nearly all great too. Sorry Oded didn't make it to the fourth film as there seemed to be a budding love interest between him and Alice.

As to this trilogy of the first three films, the first is not in the same widescreen as the other two, but I didn't notice any difference, thus I don't regret getting the three as a set. The extras are all included for each film as well. Not to mention it's cheaper to buy the three DVDs together than separately.

This is a good deal and the movies are worth watching again, despite parts being familiar. I enjoy this series and hate to see it end. I'm sure Milla will do more good stuff, however. She is amazing! The only film she starred in that I really disliked was the Joan of Arc ""bio""; Milla's acting was great, but the film is depressing, ugly, dark and miserable to sit through (not Milla's fault, however!).",1395014400,,1479,4.4907063197026025

3268564,4,B000YPUFAQ,"Great trilogy.  I loved the video game and I think the movies have added so much more depth to the story.  However as the sequels come out, it just seems like the story line is repeating itself.  The directors, writers, and producers have a so;lid foundation with this story, maybe they should start thinking up better story lines rather than just repeating: Alice finds herself in trouble, impossibly gets out using some very cool martial arts, which is impossible for mere mortals, and then faces a stronger, faster, and uglier monster.

3268578,3,B000YPUFAQ,"Really stunning Blu Ray footage, probably this is why  wanted to get it.... the movies are ok, but if you saw 1, you have seem them all. I literally can not tell which disc is in, if one is randomly inserted and skipped to 1/2 way through the movie.

If you love Resident Evil ""so much"", then you'll probably love it to bits (and think i am a moron). If you are looking for great Blu Ray footage then there is so much more to choose from now, buying something else is probably a good idea (i bought this years ago when there was far less BluRay available).",1367366400,,556,4.138888888888889

3268585,5,B000YPUFAQ,"Follow Alice through her ordeal of the Umbrella Corporation's demise. Watch her grow from a meek and mild girly girl into the mean lean fighting machine that she was meant to be. Watch her friends come and go and come again (not always in the live way either).

Although these movies are ""loosely"" based on the Game series by Capcom, and notice that I say ""loosely""!, they are far enough removed to be enjoyed by both fans of the Resident Evil series and non fans alike. there is just enough references to the game to keep the viewer interested and looking saying ""did you see that from the game?""

This may not be the best zombie series out there on the market but I will keep going back for more of that Kick Ass action from Milla as long as she is willing to keep making Resident Evil movies.

The only thing I want to make a negative comment about is that they should wait till they finish making the series before they bring out box sets, but this is not just an issue for the Resident evil Series, that goes for all series!",1360540800,,1029,4.293814432989691

Keep in mind that this series is a depiction of what the ""think tanks"" in the Pentagon view what is on the horizon.  Creepily close the to the rumored events happening a few years ago at the secret Darpa facilities.  To be viewed as a war plans scenario of what is coming.",1358035200,,362,4.343283582089552

I'm not going to write a blow by blow description about these films.  That defeats the purpose of buying & watching it.  That's why they include the synopsis with the particulars of the film.

So on the first rainy Saturday after I received the Resident Evil Trilogy on blu-ray, there we all were plopped down on the sofa waiting for the blu-ray player to begin the movie.  When the movie started it was almost like seeing it for the first time.  Rather than hearing moans and groans from the kids about how they were bored I was hearing ew, gross, did you see that?  I have to admit I felt like I was seeing the zombies for the first time and they were very detailed and gross!  The sounds were much more ""alive"" if you could say that.  Everything sounded and looked more ewwy and gooey.  8 (3 kids and mine) thumbs up!",1340323200,,835,4.2075471698113205

This is one of the few times where the sequels keep evolving with the players.

Movie wise, there is alot to  be desired. The first's SFX are laughable, a great argument for practical vs CGI effects, anyday of the week. Though its not as bad with the other movies
The story is pretty nonexistent. Luckily, after the first one they dropped and character development, focused on fighting, sfx and one liners to add to the cheese factor. and stretched out the 25 minutes worth of story to about 100 minutes. Amazingly, by doing this the movies improve, and a march more enjoyable to watch. Running Dialogue with friends is required.  I got the boxset when it was 25 bucks deal of the day. And don't feel too ripped off about it.  36 bucks I don't know know though... that might be pushing it....

Resident Evil Apocalypse, however, is just horrible. It is great to see Jill Valentine stepping in but the movie is comparable to watching paint dry.

3268742,5,B000YPUFAQ,"Even though the Amazon listing says there are 4 discs mine only had 3 and the packaging is designed to hold only 3 discs. The box even says 3 disc set on the side. Which is fine it has what you want the 3 movies. I did submit to Amazon that they change the listing.

I almost didn't buy this set because of an other review saying that one of the movies was full screen, which I hate, having all widescreen TV's, but the Apocalypse DVD has both wide and full screen on it, so I was a happy camper. All 3 are anamorphic widescreen. The first movie is 1.85:1 so it will fill a widescreen TV. Apocalypse and Extinction are both 2.40:1 so you will still get black bars on the top and bottom even on a widescreen TV.

If you're like me and own a Sony 400 disc or Pioneer 301 disc DVD changer you'll like that it does have title text and a jacket picture on all 3 discs, so you won't have to type in the name or make a backup just so you can add the name to the disc.

3268746,2,B000YPUFAQ,"I ordered this boxed set of DVDs for my husband's birthday.  I heard a rattle when I unpacked it, and checked on the discs.  The whole package is cheaply made, thin paper cardboard.  It was almost impossible to open without causing damage to the paper box.  I don't usually have to use a steak knife to open a DVD package.

One DVD is on the first side of the plastic box, and the other 2 are layered over each other on the second side, very poor design.  The disc on the top layer was loose. It wouldn't stay in place at all.

Then, I noticed as I was logging the movies (we own about 1000 DVDs, so I keep a list or we'd own about 1500 due to duplications), was that 2 of the discs are widescreen, and 1 is full screen!  Not my husband's preference, and now it's too late to order something else.

The only reason I didn't give this a 1 star review was:

1) I managed to get the overlapping disc to stay in place, finally.

2) A preview disc for movie 4 was included, as a ""bonus"".  Of course, movie 4 was released 12/2008, so that's not really a big deal anymore.",1238803200,9,1065,4.091787439613527

3268756,3,B000YPUFAQ,"I watched all 3 Blu-Rays in order in one night. My review deals primarily with the third movie as it closes the trilogy (for now).

The first film is an exciting, scary movie that's somewhat similar to the games but different from most zombie movies. Zombie humans, zombie dogs, and a computer-generated Licker all threaten the heroes, who are investigating a viral outbreak in an underground research lab. The movie introduces butt-kicking Alice (played by Milla Jovovich), who is not in the games. She ends up being the glue that holds this trilogy together as each film is quite different from the others.

2 remains my favorite because it's just the most fun. The comic relief is appreciated and I like some of the situations that occur, like the tense church scene. It's also the closest to the games out of the 3 movies. However the writing is dumb at times, such as the graveyard sequence and the climactic battle between Alice and Nemesis. The Nemesis monster as portrayed here is not a frightening villain. He just fights with guns and other weapons and his costume fails to impress. Still, look at this movie as a simple sci-fi action flick instead of horror and you'll probably enjoy it.

3 was a huge disappointment... Failing to explain the absence of two key characters from part 2 is really unsatisfying. The only possible conclusion within the logic of the movie's world is that they died, which is no fun at all. Then the post-apocalyptic setting - which would be fine for a zombie movie in general - doesn't work in the Resident Evil universe at all. So already it's just not Resident Evil any more. Throwing in the tyrant and the crows was a cool idea but it's too little too late. RE fans know those have been around since the timeline of RE1, so their introduction just further separates the continuity of the films and games.

The movie also commits the crime of killing off every likable character, leaving the audience with no one to attach themselves to. Videogame protagonist Claire Redfield is wasted in this movie, and Alice has become so alien that it's hard to worry about her.

And finally, Extinction's zombies look terrible. I know they were going for a sundrenched effect, but they still look like vomit. As I recall they also abandoned the CG-enhancement of the zombies (giving them transparent parts and such) that looked so cool in 1 & 2. Then the super zombies.... Oh man. Those fake eyebrows didn't look good in Buffy and Angel and they look even worse on brown zombies.

As a whole, this box-set represents a good value. The movies are so different, it's hard to give a strong thumbs up or down (hence my 3-star rating). The picture quality and sound are awesome. The extras are fairly significant, with deleted scenes, alternate endings, and loads of featurettes. If you're really into the Resident Evil movies this box is a great and affordable way to show off your HDTV and Blu-Ray player.",1216425600,,2932,4.716796875
3268757,4,B000YPUFAQ,"I think it's a good series of movies.  Not really scary, but more sci-fi thriller, maybe.  Great action, and of course Milla Jovovich is just hot!!",1212019200,,147,4.615384615384615

3268760,4,B000YPUFAQ,"Rather than buying the three movies separate, why not save some money & buy all three (even though the last one isn't really worth watching).  The picture is superb & the sound is awesome...worth the purchase if you liked the 1st & 2nd installments of this ""video game gone movie"".",1206403200,,281,4.62
3268761,4,B000YPUFAQ,"As far as the movies go I really liked the first one and thought the other two were alright.  I won't go into any further detail because whether you like a movie or not is subjective.  I'm sure you know what type of movies these are if you are considering purchasing them, and I would recommend them if you like horror/sci-fi/action adventure films.  I think the most important thing I could share with you is the picture quality of these blu-ray discs which is fantastic. They look great on a big screen hi-def tv and I would highly recommend them if that is what is most important to you.",1206316800,,590,4.394495412844036
3268762,5,B000YPUFAQ,"As a fan of the games since the first amazing one burst on to the scene,  seeing the first movie was an essential. It was very good, although at times I  was hoping it would stick to more of the game - but this is a different medium, and I  got used to it, and grew to love the movie - especially with the magical and inspired casting of MIlla Jovovich in the lead role !
Second film ' Apocalypse ' was initially disappointing - but having now seen it in Blu-ray Hi-Def. it seems like a different movie !
Compellingly watchable, it grabs hold of your attention from the start - and never let's go.
Having received the Blu-ray Trilogy from Amazon here, I  waited to see how film 3  would be....
And - just have to say that it's  the  BEST  yet !
New director, Russell Mulcahy - takes the post-apocalyptic theme with strong resonances of the second Mad Max movie - and injects amazing new inspiration into the story, the camera-work, special effects, make-up, costumes  etc
I  haven't enjoyed a movie as much for ages !
Obviously, there will be a sequel - and what's wrong with that ?
The Trilogy of films are  ALL  different - the first, essentially filmed indoors in dark and natural light; the second, filmed outside, mainly in the dark, and the third - filmed in Mexico in high heat and broad daylight. And - the zombies have moved on to a more advanced evolution -they're fast - and even more nasty and ugly-looking - amazing make-up !
And - as well as the gorgeous Milla who appears in 2  different forms - a  few other honeyz to excite the attention.
ALL round - highly impressive !
Now, I  just can't wait for the  4th !
Highly recommended.",1205193600,2,1646,4.330065359477124
3268763,4,B000YPUFAQ,"I haven't watched RE:Extinction yet, but I am quite happy with the picture quality of the blu-ray transfers for RE1 and 2.  It's not jaw-droppingly good like Spiderman 3, but they are definitely some of the better looking blus I own.  I'm particularly impressed with the details that comes out in the dark sequences in RE1 (which is a lot of the movie).  The special features are kind of thin, IMO, but it's better than some (Fifth Element, Black Hawk Down and Kingdom of Heaven, I'm looking at you!).  Overall a solid buy, especially given the less than $50 price tag for all three films.",1205020800,,589,4.580952380952381
