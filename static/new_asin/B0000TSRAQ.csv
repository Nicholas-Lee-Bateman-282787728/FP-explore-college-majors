1945703,1,B0000TSRAQ,"Ok, just to set the record straigth: I love Steve Vai, I think he's an amazing musician, just saw him at the G3, wonderful showman... just love the guy. That being said, I am sorry to tell that this is probably one of the worst live DVDs I ever seen in my life! I had great expectations for this DVD. Maybe too much! I have been eagerly waiting for it to come out for the last 2 months and when I got it yesterday I could not wait to put it in the player: my enthusiam went down as fast as Steve can play and my anger grew as big as his technic... Where... did they get these cameramen?! This is a DVD for people who love the guitar and cannot wait to see the maestro perfom and admire his technic... Well nothing of that in this DVD. I have never seen something as badly and poorly shot as this video. The guy seems not to be able to focus on Steve's hands (when you actually get to see both of them, which is rare), or gives close ups that are so close that the only thing you get to see his the back of Steve right hand, that is completely blocking the view of Steve's right hand. You get to see huge close-ups of Steve's face, flying hair, back, bottom of his guitar, sometimes you don't have anybody in the shot at all, sometimes you have special FX like in a video clip... I gave it 35mn before I could not stand it anymore and just stop watching... too painful and frustrating... I will probably never watch that thing again (let me know if you want it, I'll put it on ebay) and will only use it to record a live of Steve on my MiniDisc.  I am actually thinking of sending it back to Favoured Nations altogether. Don't care about the $18. I just feel like I have been cheated. If you really like Steve, just don't buy this stuff. Go get Satch Live in San Francisco, now THAT's a DVD  for guitar lovers!! Well that's it for me. Going back to pratice my chords and scales.",1071014400,3,1877,4.084010840108401

1945709,5,B0000TSRAQ,I can't get enough of Vai.  He's in my top 5 for guitarists.  I wish he had more dvds out.  If you know him you know he's extraordinary.  And knowing that you know you'll enjoy this.,1395532800,2,182,3.9722222222222223
1945710,5,B0000TSRAQ,"This performance is terrific, absolutely stunning.  Vai has perfected what Hendrix pioneered and delivers it with absolute joy and showmanship.  This is a man who has mastered his craft.  Didn't like the organ solo much but that wasn't Vai and its easy to skip!",1382313600,2,261,4.886363636363637

1945712,4,B0000TSRAQ,"What an awesome performance. Steve and Billy dueling it up was so much fun to watch. Them opening with Shyboy was a great choice, remenancing of those David Lee Roth days.

Virgil Donati's drum solo was powerful, exciting, and flashy. A great lineup to be caught on DVD.

The sound was great and the performance of each individual was amazing. You can really feel the energy of the show.
The only downside was the constant swirling and cutting to different angles ever 2 seconds, which was annoying, but the awesomeness of the music made up for it. It just would have been so much better if it was kept simple.

Overall, great DVD.",1358553600,,631,4.566371681415929
1945713,5,B0000TSRAQ,"1.  Rock, Hard Rock, Heavy Metal... whatever you want to call it has the reputation of being basic music, performed by... unsophisticated ""rock stars"".  The bottomline is that incredible artists exists in a variety of genres and disciplines and Steve Vai is truly a guitar genius.  This DVD concert is a musician's dream;  no compromises, total 100% performances by a band that is truly top notch (amazing amazing band).  In this day of vanilla music, I'm truly grateful that there are still a few hardcore musical titans to keep me inspired.
2.  This DVD is highly recommended.",1336089600,,578,4.907216494845361
1945714,5,B0000TSRAQ,"4.5 stars

Hadn't listened to Vai in many a moon and threw this on last night with the video off, audio only, while doing some work. A Revelation! I'd seen and enjoyed it a few times when it came out but found the cheeeezy video effects too annoying to merit frequent viewings. But all told they are merely a distraction from the real deal here, Steve's typically ridiculously flawless technique and execution, married to one of his more musical evenings.

He's clearly a total ham, as years with Francesco would do to any semi-sane man, and his banter is often entertaining. But when he shuts up and plays his guitar and unleashes his endless chops, boy howdy! I was reminded why he's right up there with Jimi, Eddie and El Becko for sheer guitaristic genius: Vai, while lacking their looser, funkier feel, has a level of precision and intensity that is all his own.

Check out the blues workout on The Animal and then jump to For The Love Of God, both from his classic Passion And Warfare. Nobody else has reached that level of execution on e-git, not Gilbert, Satch, Yngwie, etc etc.. Not all of the phrases are gems, but enough of them astound to send any guitar-loving listener over the moon and back. ""Completely WAILING!"" barely covers it. And almost all of the concert is at that level. Nutty. I once saw Prince do a killer show at the Astoria and never imagined I'd see even wilder and crisper guitar playing on that stage, yet here it is, a true master class for any electric guitarist. I saw Vai in '86, '95 and '03, and while those shows were excellent, this one is as good as Vai can play, I'd say. And that's purty good.

Plus this has got to be his best band: two other killer git players who most guys would be scared witless to play with, especially the ever-underrated Mr. McAlpine. Sheehan and Weiner nail their parts and Donati is a real battery; Vai clearly drives all of them to the edge of their abilities. One real minus for my ears is the comparatively very weak singing, though there's not much of it; the voices here are quite simply not at the level of the instruments accompanying them. But it's ultimately an intensely fun workout for all concerned, including the listener---this many notes and ideas at this speed is exhilarating, which is why so many of us progheads love this stuff. Overload my brain, please!

Just do your ears and eyes a favor: turn the screen off and the volume way up.",1313625600,,2422,4.52054794520548
1945715,4,B0000TSRAQ,Vai is on fire in this performance. Totally awesome. I could write hundreds of words praising his otherworldly artistic abilities. There is some irritating camera work but this DVD is still a must-have for any Vai fan or anyone at all serious about music let alone guitar. I hope Vai lives forever.,1307232000,,298,4.75
1945716,5,B0000TSRAQ,"This is the only Vai DVD I own, and I'm glad I made this choice.  I don't own much of the music he's produced since this show, so it showcases the songs of which I'm a fan.  Steve always seems to be at his best with Sheehan there in support, and adding MacAlpine to the mix...the harmonized solos are just INCREDIBLE to watch.  Sheehan's cover of ""Shy Boy"" (which he wrote) is a nice touch, and in fact the version of ""Chameleon"" here actually turned me on to some of his solo stuff.  For me the standouts are ""Erotic Nightmares,"" ""Bad Horsie"" (love the lasers) and of course ""For The Love Of God,"" but every song is fun to watch.  Having only seen Vai live when he toured with Whitesnake back in '90 or so, it's really cool to see his personality emerge here, where he's leading the show.",1269734400,,789,4.268456375838926
1945717,5,B0000TSRAQ,i recomend it if you are taking guitar classes or studying any stringed instrument . it's very educational into what performing music with great musicians like the ones playing with vai.

1945719,5,B0000TSRAQ,After all these years a friend just turned me on to Steve Vai and what better way than watching him work on DVD?  He and his band are something that I don't even have words to describe!  Besides hot!  I'm hooked on Vai-agra!,1243814400,,224,4.162790697674419
1945720,5,B0000TSRAQ,"This is on of the BEST live DVD of Steve Vai, it give you a true feeling of Steve Vai talents of his guitar playing, he is one of the best live performer a very entertaining on the stage, his fellow bands members give a true FULL band experience

1945721,5,B0000TSRAQ,"After watching these DVD's several times, you begin to realize that you are sharing an amazing moment in time. For me, it feels like this is more than a DVD. More like a living entity who is fed by it's task to whisk you away from whatever else is going on in your life. This is a magic carpet ride on the strings of Steve's JEM, and what a trip it is. His band, ""The Breed"" is nothing short of magical, and every player is the perfect host to Mister Vai's incredible voyage around the universe and beyond. Thanks are in order to Steve for listening to his audience, and giving us a glimpse of what it must seem like to be around him at one of his most spectacular performances. This is what God wanted when giving the order for music to be created, and sharing this moment of Vai-consciousness exists, (if for no other reason) so that we can embark on a truly spiritual journey for a moment indeed too short.",1211241600,,909,4.2601156069364166

Can learn a lot from watching carefully!",1172620800,,114,5.333333333333333
1945726,5,B0000TSRAQ,"I have been a Steve Vai fan for 20 years but the only times I saw him playing were in video clips, which cannot represent well what a musician like him is capable of.

I bought this DVD and before having a chance to watching it, I read all the comments here. It has scared me the comments about bad edits, as I thought they would be as bad as the ones made by Mike Portnoy for the ""Scenes From A Memory"" DVD.

However, this is not the fact. The camera does not focus totally on the Steve's fingers but we can see most of his playing well enough.

Despite the critics that might be applied to the edition, we have a super group playing live. This single fact would make the DVD interesting, but Billy Sheehan, MacAlpine and Donnati just add their own light to the Steves songs. I personally liked how Sheehan played the songs from ""Passion And Warfare"" ( which had Stuart Hamm originally on bass ) and the incredible and insanne shredding from MacAlpine as well as the three guitar parts and the bass and guitar doubles.

Of course I miss a few songs, but overall this is a must for Steve Vai fans. Be aware that if you dislike shredding and soloing this might not appeal to you as this is present here in the huge doses. In fact, this is a great piece of art if that is what you are looking for.",1169510400,2,1295,4.188755020080321
1945727,3,B0000TSRAQ,"I would like to state that Steve Vai in my opinion is one of the greatest guitar players I've seen, also it is a shame how bad he skills when it comes to creating music. For the love of God (included on this DVD), Tender surrender (not included) and I would love to (not included) are the only songs I actually like to hear.

Anyway this DVD is not such a good purchase not because Steve's performance but because of the annoying effects. The camera is moving all the time switching between the drums, bass, keyboard and Steve. It was more like watching my young kid playing with a video camera instead of a professional recording.

I give it 3 stars because I really like seeing Steve playing guitars but for the rest it is not worth it.",1167609600,2,738,4.340579710144928
1945728,5,B0000TSRAQ,"This DVD is for guitar players.  If you need inspiration...if you need to know what the guitar is capable of...this is the DVD for you.  If you like showmanship in a live performance...this is the DVD for you.

If you are a pop music fan that does not consider a piece of music to be real music if there is no lead singer...skip this DVD.  If you believe there is never any reason to become a vituoso guitar player...or if you think playing the same 3 cords over and over while repeating the same tired blues licks makes you a virtuoso...skip this DVD.  If you think a guitarist like Clapton standing in one spot for an entire show is the way to go...skip this DVD.

Vai is one-of-a-kind.  Most can't say that.  He moves, he grooves...and he still plays things that mortals cannot play.

I have an appreciation for showmanship in rock music.  You could make the case that's what rock music is all about.  Give me Hendrix burning his guitar, Elvis moving his pelvis, Pete Townsend smashing his guitar, KISS...doing all that stuff they do, Stevie Ray playing behind his back...and Steve Vai changing costumes and having a fan blow his hair. (Every band wears ""costumes""...some just don't call it that.)  This is rock and roll...not church music.  You'd better be willing to put on a show.  I'll buy your CD and sit home if you offer me no reason to watch you play.  And don't just hire 20 dancers to run through the same dance routines I've seen a thousand times either.  Show me what you are really feeling out there.

I had no idea the camera work was so bad until I read these reviews.  What's the problem?  True, there are a couple of times I wanted to see what Steve was doing...but geez...it's over 2 hours...I get to see him plenty.

This is the one concert DVD I own that I will watch over and over.  Inspiration is cheap with this one.",1158278400,5,1842,4.4226190476190474
1945729,3,B0000TSRAQ,Whoever is resopnsible for the visual production of this DVD should be banned from ever going near a video camera again. EVER. Totally ruins what is otherwise a great concert. The world would be better place if this was just an audio CD.,1154649600,2,237,4.534883720930233
1945730,2,B0000TSRAQ,"Like ""I. MUNOZ"" said ""contaminated"" with video effects.

Some 15 year old must have just gotten his first video editing equipment, and felt the need to use every single effect, almost all the freekin' time.

Sound and selection of material is fine, but I buy DVDs because they include VIDEO, so if the video sux, the DVD sux. This sux.",1153008000,,335,4.566666666666666
1945731,5,B0000TSRAQ,"The perfermance is monstrous.  Perhaps some feel that writing a less than stellar review elevates themselves to relevance.  I've been playing guitar seriously for many years; not only do you get top quality material, but you get a lot of top quality material, like practice sessions and back stage scenes.  I'm not sure there is a better value anywhere.",1146268800,4,353,4.9491525423728815
1945732,3,B0000TSRAQ,"well torture would be too extreme, but I find that when I've put the video in on occasion, I can't watch it long without the video effects killing me. My advice, don't bother with the dvd and just buy the cd. The sound quality also sounds better on the cd.

1945733,4,B0000TSRAQ,"I would have gladly given five stars to this DVD if it wouldn't include a second DVD with really poor and badly-planned additional material. I have no doubt that Steve is one of the greatest Rock guitar players, and this DVD is a must for those who really appreciate his creativity and virtuosity. The hunch that I have is how poorly the additional features were planned and executed. I really hope Steve put to work his staff to come up with more creative and interesting material for his fans and for those who want to learn a couple of guitar tricks from the master, in future productions.",1137456000,,592,4.542056074766355
1945734,5,B0000TSRAQ,"This isn't a guy on stage doing guitar...he is other-worldly!  I have had the opportunity to see him perform twice on G3 and he has no equal.  His performance here on the DVD is a small taste of how authentic and passionate a  musician can be on stage.  This DVD is really great and to those who poo-poo the technical DVD splicing and mastery, oh well, get a grip.  The 2nd disc gives a great insight into the band atmosphere, interviews done mostly with Dave Weiner. I was bummed there were no personal Steve interviews.  The DVD concert commentary with Vai and the rest of the band regarding the show is fairly interesting and Vai even comments at how random a thought it was to do this DVD ( I believe he decided like two weeks before the show) so considering that, I don't think this is all that bad.  But the playing is phenomenal!! Billy Sheehan tears it up and the harmonic dualing with Tony and Dave is so mind-blowing, you have to get this DVD!! It is a great price for all you get. Whispering a Prayer and Bad Horsie are my favorites!!  I definetely recommend seeing him live but this is a wonderful alternative.",1134518400,8,1122,4.386473429951691
1945735,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Steve Vai does what he does and does it well. Another reviewer here was complaining about over the top Egocentric behavior, ruining this DVD for him, well obviously he is not familar with Mr. Vai. This is what he is all about, and I love it. His ecentric and egocentric riffs are beyond defination. He has a style that is all it's own. Hypnotic, mesmerising come to mind. That really does not capture it, it's over the top yes, but thats what makes it. His hands seem to defy gravity, and leave you speechless. Now about this DVD, it's a great show case for Mr. Vai. The sound, camera work and set list are all perfect. I have seem Steve Vai 3 times, once with Frank Zappa, once with G 3 and Joe Satriani and once on his own. This show rivals any of those shows seen in person. This man is a modern day Rock hero, because hes not afraid to be different, he suceeds on every level. It's refreshing to hear a new style that no one else uses, it could almost be called Ballad hard rock without the cheesy vocals mostly. If you have any interest in this type of music with amazing guitar at blazing speed but fully under control you have to see this concert. if you like it, it might give you a feeling of uforia or make you cry with feeling. It reminds me of being high, its intoxicating. Some hate it, I love it. I think you will too.",1127606400,8,1332,4.186770428015564
1945736,5,B0000TSRAQ,"I actually went to this show, and bought the DVD as soon as it came out -- and I was not at all disappointed.  Masterful guitar work, superb tones and effects use, awesome songwriting -- it is flawless in my opinion.  Every musician on the stage gets a chance to demonstrate his skill on an individual level as well as in the band situation - and Vais expression and naturally perfect note choices continue to amaze me as the years pass.

I would HIGHLY recommend this dvd to anyone who can appreciate good songwriting and great musicianship.",1127520000,5,542,4.56701030927835
1945737,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Dont listen to the haters. This sounds Awesome and not only do you get Steve but you get to hear the others as well. I agree about the 2nd dvd being useless because it is but the musicianship is Top notch.

Not quite Joe Satriani - Live in San Francisco but it's close. It's a little more laid back.",1127433600,,299,4.067796610169491
1945738,5,B0000TSRAQ,"I bought this DVD for my 16 year old son, who loves rock music, and is driving me crazy cause he's playing it over and over every day.  He likes the close-up on the electric guitar, which  moves him to try to play along and the image is excellent.

So, thumbs up for this DVD that was one of the birthday gifts he received and treasures.",1126224000,2,337,4.075757575757576
1945739,4,B0000TSRAQ,"Maybe there's a battle going on in this man: ego and spirit, both in full dragon-bloom, seem to be twisting and tormenting and writhing deep within. Sometimes his beaming countenance seems incongruous with the wickedness of his delivery, and other times his playing raises goose-bumps, which means he's touching deep places, places where only spirits are allowed. Which will win remains to be heard. But after watching this DVD, I think Vai is actually very restrained. The ecstasy with which he plays belongs high atop an enormous cultic pyramid during some mass sacrificial ritual, replete with slick red stairs and hooded priests reaping hearts, lightning flashes, blinding tempests, and the swirling souls of the recently taken faithful passing into and out of Master Vai. But, alas, this is the 21st century, with legitimate authorities and little breathing room for radical mystics. What do these quick thoughts have to do with his DVD? For me, everything. This DVD is only a concert because concerts are the only legal venue for this man. He's surpassed the guitar. It's an excuse. He doesn't play it; he possesses it, or it him. Flo is like Stormbringer and Vai is Elric. (See Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone.) I've always liked Vai, since I first discovered the floppy record of the Attitude Song in a guitar magazine in the 1980's. And I still do. He's just not a guitar player anymore. The world needs more Vais. I'm interested in finding out what happens, so I'll be waiting for the next addition, but I'm not going anywhere near that pyramid...! (I write this with a light heart and a tongue in cheek! Vai is a guitar god, and I tremble at his virtuosity. Bless you, Steve Vai!!!)

OR.... he's playing around: a little Tinsel Town rebellion, Vai style. But enough pyschocinematic analysis. Steve Vai is an amazing musician, and even though, per criticism of another reviewer, much of what he does couldn't be done on Stevie Ray Vaughan's guitar, this reviewer is thoroughly impressed. Come on!!! I'm sure Vai could make SRV's guitar do some pretty fantastic stuff, but why should he? He's Vai not Vaughan: so if he wants to play 9 or 10 guage strings on a guitar that would confound most, then the more power to him. This review submitted for Vai and the Vai faithful.

As for the cinematography... yes, it's loopy. Maybe a little too much, but the camera operators were in the moment... Can't blame them!",1108771200,2,2416,4.833333333333333

1945741,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Great DVD. Many of the bad reviews find silly reasons to give the DVD a bad rating. I personally bought it for the music and the performance. I agree the camera work is a little rough. Steve Vai is an amazing virtuoso who can play better than 99.9% of the guitar playing population. (with the exception of maybe Satch and Petrucci) Steve's stage antics are downright hilarious. May I suggest that the outfits thing and the wind in the face is not his ego showing, but him making a mockery of the whole rockstar image thing? maybe....",1106611200,2,533,4.505154639175258

 as far as this dvd is concerned it is an atrocity really: REALLY BAD VIDEO EFECTS

TERRIBLE GUITAR TONE AND EFFECTS

CRAPPY SONG WRITING

BAD SEQUENCING-but how do you tastefully sequence a whole slew of mediocre or just plain terrible songs??

Yes, everybody have their own personal opinion and our millenium batch says his great and of course there are still those dim witted jealous & envious people who seem not fitted for being a critic as obviously, their ears are defective. Steve Vai is a musical genius and a grammy award proves that he is in fact worthy. Another thing he is also in the so called heavy G3 trio and those other guys who jam with him seems to be enjoying his company.

But no players have come across since with such apogee and influenced as many.  Steve Vai actually makes the guitar a boring instrument to listen to.  There isn't anything exciting in his play.  The songs are dull and their composition is outdated.  Vai is till churning out the old Frank Zappa type of play, and to be 'frank' it's dead.  His only audience must be the over 40s.",1092355200,3,520,4.711111111111111

that is an act of love for his work.  We all can marvel at his ability but his drive and passion has created the player that is expressed.

Dave Weiner as an new guitarist is nothing special.  Not a Paul Gilbert, Jason Becker or Ritchie Kotzen, if you know whata mean.  Tony Macalpine has opted to forget his solo career and now work as a background monkey for Vai and play the keyboards whilst Vai does the show as the grinder.  Billy Sheen looks like he;s aged 30 years since the DLR days and sucks.  The extra disc to this concert is crap.  Overall this pile of trash is absolute and utter crap.  Avoid!",1091577600,2,626,4.327586206896552
1945749,2,B0000TSRAQ,"I bought this DVD in consolation of not being able to afford his forthcoming live tour 'downunder', which makes this review even more keenly felt.
I agree with all the reviews about the video editing!
Tragic- i don't know if i can ever watch this DVD again.
I have ALL Vai's CD's and a G3 VHS but this one leaves me cold.
I commend Vai's attempts at presenting an entertaining show but i'm surprised that the music has even left me nonchalant.
For the first time ever i thought i was watching a gratuitous display of 'chops'.Maybe the visuals put me in a less receptive mood.
Surely he didn't watch this before it was released.
Mr. Vai can do MUCH better than this.

1945750,5,B0000TSRAQ,"This was the first time I'd ever seen Steve Vai in concert, and I was thoroughly impressed. As many know, this man is one of the best, and his performance here just solidifies his ""rock god"" status. The performance is completely exhausting, but in a good way. It's just one relentless guitar riff after another, neverending solos, and nonstop energy.
There are a lot of complaints about the visual aspect of this DVD. Yes, the camerawork is far from ""professional,"" but it seemed more than appropriate for this type of concert. Yes, Steve Vai is a bit silly in his stage antics. But to say he's childish and needs to grow up in order to be respected as a musician? His guitar playing, what he's paid to do, is far from childish, my friend. This is Steve Vai being Steve Vai, and if you want to see Joe Satriani, watch him instead.
If you're going to be put off easily by the visuals of a music DVD, I might advise not getting it. Personally, I didn't even notice anything was ""wrong,"" because I was enjoying the show too much. For the price and the healthy amount of interesting extras on this 2 disc DVD, I would HIGHLY recommend this purchase to anyone who wants to see a master at work.",1087344000,5,1189,4.409090909090909
1945751,3,B0000TSRAQ,"I'm loathe to write a ""me too"" review, but I felt my opinion might help drive home the important points. I agree with the comments given by Sarah Nelson and Tim Merriman. Those are good summaries. Vai's performance is awesome, but the video is highly annoying, especially for us guitar players.  As others have mentioned, too often the video will cut to Steve's back (or some equally annoying shot) at the same moment Steve plays some riff that the guitar players want to see. They need to have a few guitar players in the editing booth.
The video is too busy in any case, and the effects are excessive and annoying. Don't buy this DVD in order to catch your favorite riffs. It is likely that the shot will be of something else. The G3 Live in Denver is much more watchable.
The basic stereo audio is good, I will give it that. (I cannot speak for the surround sound since I don't use it).",1086134400,,889,4.387878787878788
1945752,1,B0000TSRAQ,"Anyone who's seen the concert video of Yessongs will be all too familiar with what ruins this dvd.  Horrible video editing and camera work.  Let's face it.  95% of people interested in this dvd are guitar players fascinated by the lightning guitar work of Steve Vai.  We want to see clear, consistent shots of his hands blazing up and down the fretboard and his various right-hand technique.  That's it.
While there is some of this, waaaaaaaay too often during his blistering solo passages, the camera shot is of the back of Billy Sheehan, or the drummer.  In other words, what you don't want to see.  It's so frustrating, you want to kick your tv.  I swear there's an intentionally blurry five minute shot of of the butt of his guitar instead of his hands.  There's also more quick camera angle switches than an episode of MTV's Cribs.  And the weirdest thing of all??? Inexplicable slow-motion shots of some emotionless woman standing in the front row.  Who is this woman?  She looks like she's at the wrong concert.
The music still holds a lot of value, but it is not enhanced at all by the visuals of Steve's fan-blown hair, curiously numerous wardrobe changes, and stage moves from the eighties, all mashed together by some high school Audio\Visual club.",1085356800,5,1259,4.724770642201835

1945754,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Long-time fans already know what Steve is capable of, and this DVD should serve as a shining example to new listeners (and new guitarists, of course) of the kind of expression possible with an electric guitar when it is in the hands of a master.  Aside from obviously high quality, non-formulaic songwriting and dazzling technical skills, the thing that has always impressed me the most about Steve is that every note he plays, even in very rapid passages, is articulated like a word in a sentence.  That is, there are no notes that are merely ""played,"" but rather are ""spoken"" in terms of phrasing, rhythm, dynamics, attack, tone, etc.  As a guitarist of 20+ years, I can tell you that it is exhausting to play even a slow passage of Steve Vai music because of this.  Each note must be worked individually.  Of course the DVD also shows us again what a great entertainer and showman Vai can be.  Highly recommended.",1083542400,3,916,4.658385093167702

I eagerly anticipated this DVD, when I got it, I literally wanted to stop it after the 3rd song. There are a lot of comments here about the bad camera work..the comments are more than correct, the camera work is horrible, the editing is just as bad. The editor uses the effects package like a high school sophmore editing his first project..REALLY cheesy video transitions. The 2nd DVD is a complete waste of time that I will never get back. Nothing worth watching at all.
Having said all this, any Vai fan will love the music, that goes without saying. Whoever was responsible should have hired a professional video company to shoot and edit this. It really is a disaster, I will never watch it again. Best thing is to rip the audio to a CD and listen to it without the horrible camera work. My only hope is that Vai tries this again on his next tour with a real camera crew, and a real editor.

1945758,3,B0000TSRAQ,"Steve's really not the best when Dvd time comes. Do you remember the disappointing ""Alien love secrets""? From a DVD technical standpoint this is probably worst. I'm talking strictly about the realization of this single product, I'm not talking about Steve or about this music. It is self explanatory that if I did buy this Dvd I appreciate the guy and his music. Obviousy. I'm saying that this Dvd is NO good. This package comprehend two discs. The first is the concert and I'll say what I think later. The second cd is terrible, meaningless gags. I mean it is irritating really. Why lose an apportunity so big to let fans see something interesting and musically important? No, Steve probably thinks at his fans as totally fools. An hour or more of gags and stupid stuff. Pure garbage. There are few minutes of rehearsals which are the only minutes that deserves to be seen, but just once. The quality of the camera works are incredibly low. The concert. The stage is embarassing. The worst stage I have ever seen in a Dvd. Steve, look at Satriani's San Francisco stage. And learn. That one is a professional stage, lights and so on. Your stage is a garage band stage. The track list is not that fantastic. Sex and religion material is completly out of this concert and this disappoint me. The things, dress and moves and stuff Steve did on stage to entertain people are clownesque things that I personally don't like at all. The camera work is histeric, the post production effects are really cheap.... and in the end, just to tell the perfect truth, and it hurts me to say this, Steve is playing the same old licks. Be honest. He stopped evolving many years ago. I mean that tapping thing on the pentatonic scale, the other tapping thing with the two fingers of his right hand on the full fretboard .. that lydian mode. It is somewhat boring, the same old stuff. I really didn't think I have to say these things about Steve and about this live that I awaited for so long, but this is the truth. This is not what I was expected. It is a lot less. Last. A great line up. Steve, Sheehan, Donati, Macalpine and ,.... well, ""the other guy"" I can't remember his name sorry, three stars only for the guys playing here. And for some of the old Passion and Warfare tracks. That's it.",1080691200,5,2276,4.5

1945761,3,B0000TSRAQ,"This should have been the DVD release of the year. Vai is brilliant. Sheehan is brilliant. I saw the G3 tour that went out before this solo tour, and it was AWESOME. 2 things kill this DVD though. The first, as nearly everyone has mentioned, is the camera work. To call it annoying is an understatement. It has the potential to send Japanese school children into seizures in spots.
The second, and most discouraging, is the poor 5.1 audio mix. I know, there's a disclamer when you select it about ""checking your equipment"", but I have a state of the art home theatre, and this DVD sounded like crap through it. As has been the case with a lot of concert DVD's, the artists tries to do too much with the surround channels and it ends up sounding hollow. The only thing coming though in my center channel was the snare drum. Now, when you go to a concert, is that what's front and center? No. Poor sound imaging. Fortunately, the PCM Stereo mix is decent. Not enough bass for my taste, but that was a problem at the actual show I saw with this band as well. I compensated by using the ""6 Channel Stereo"" DSP effect on my receiver. This gave me the best sound.
I was actually going to give this DVD a 2 star rating, but now that I think about it, I'll give it a 3. I'd recommend buying it, just don't bother with the 5.1 mix.",1078444800,2,1322,4.25
1945762,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Enough with these FOOLISH comments regarding this video. This is simply one of the finest DVDs of its kind! If you like Steve Vai or this type of instrumental guitar rock this is THE DVD to own!! For those commenting on the effects or camera angles all I can say is GO WATCH AUSTIN CITY LIMITS if all you want is BLAND,STRAIGHT FORWARD,PBS VIDEO. Steve Vai is a CREATIVE GENIUS. Do you expect HIS PROJECT to be VANILLA?? If you do then you know NOTHING of the man or his music and I wonder why you would buy this anyway. Steve admits in the commentary that he wishes he'd had a pre production meeting with the camera ops before the shows...he didn't and the result is more shots of his face and reaction type shots than he would have liked. Other than that there really isn't ANYTHING to be critical of on this project. You get what you pay for...STEVE VAI MUSIC...being played at its FINEST! The video is digital and the clarity is outstanding. The sound is also above average,compared to other recent live DVDs like Rush in Rio.
All in all,this is a MUST HAVE for any VAI fan. Not only do you get one of the premiere guitar players in the world in SV but you get the legendary BILLY SHEEHAN on bass and TONY MCALPINE on keys/guitar. The other players in the band are also total pros and the result is a super tight show. Dont even hesitate if you like this kind of music...click on PURCHASE...NOW!!

And what a band!  Vai and bassist Billy Sheehan play some blazing extended unison tapping licks so perfect it sounds like one person with an octave divider.  Any band that has Tony MacAlpine playing backup guitar and keyboards, you know has to be so technically amazing its ridiculous!  A good value too, as the concert disk 1 had over 2 hours of performance with a second backstage disk thrown in.",1077580800,4,571,4.495145631067961

It looks like people are complaining about the camera work of the video, since Vai himself produced it.  Something should be said about seeing his performance the way he intended us to see it.  Would you honestly want to watch his hands and technique the whole time?  No, man.  This is not a guitar lesson.  If you just watch the guitar the whole time, you're missing half of the show.  Vai is one of the most animated performers you'll ever see, and this DVD will prove that.  The special effects only complement the already superb performance.
This DVD is mandatory for any fan of Steve Vai and is highly recommended for aspiring guitarists.",1077148800,3,844,4.5364238410596025
1945765,4,B0000TSRAQ,"Vai's stage performances are legendary, and it's about time one came out on DVD.  The camera work is fantastic, though the effects are overdone in quite a few places.  This is certainly not to say that it completely ruins the impression - the editing is average, for I've seen a lot worse.  For example, to my tastes, this DVD is miles above Satriani's Live in San Francisco, in terms of camera angles and camera movement.  Also, some of the effects are, in fact appropriate.
I'm not a real big fan of Vai's music.  I like this DVD mainly because I like the way Steve's shows are orchestrated and planned out.  The song selection is decent, from Vai's repertoire.  They also do a couple of Hendrix covers and a song from Billy Sheehan's album.  Dave gets a solo spot; Tony gets several on both guitar and keyboards.  Virgil's drum solo is thrown in towards the end.
Yes, Vai overdresses for the occassion.  As a matter of fact, he overdoes just about everything he does on stage.  And if I were as good with a guitar as he is, I'd expect no one to give me a hard time about overdoing whatever it is I want to overdo when I'm on stage.  I'd also feel entitled to say whatever I wanted to - those without a sense of humor (see reviews below) needn't apply.
Overall, quality release, something to be watched from beginning to end on an occasion, rather than bits and pieces.  4 stars due to the shortcomings of the video itself - I'd give 4.5 if I could, since I can ignore the effects for the most part.",1076976000,4,1501,4.356115107913669

if the camera work had been great, i would watch this dvd atleast 5 times a day. since it's so awful, i'll just watch it by listening a few times a month or whenever i feel like listening to steve.
one thing i notice, it's hard to listen to steve's song if you're not really listening to it with a critical ear. It's not the type of music where you pop it into the cd player and just bug out, you have to really sit and listen to the difficulty and style to really enjoy it. it's not the type of music for cars or outdoor. it has to be you and the cd player, in your room, alone, turn it up really loud, and just let it amaze you.",1076716800,,850,3.947674418604651

Vai goes WAY over the top with his theatrics and makes some stupid speeches throughout the concert. I often wish he would focus more on the music and less on the theatrical aspect. Yes, it is entertaining, but only to a point. Vai always seems to go past that point. However, the playing is excellent throughout and is worth buying if you are a Vai fan. Particularly impressive is the performance of 'Whispering a Prayer'. Great piece.",1076716800,2,583,4.782178217821782

1945769,4,B0000TSRAQ,"I'm kinda old school... 80's old school and graduated in 85. I had heard of Vai, listened to him with David Lee Roth. That was the last time I listened to him. Never really was a fan. After watching this DVD, I regret not following him. I was blown away at his talent. Just watched and listened in pure awe. Everyone in that band for that matter. Good lord, Billy can make that bass sing. I had no idea he was such a great basest.
I know some people say Steve needs to grow up and stop acting like a teen... C'mon. It's rock and roll. So what if he's mid 40's and still jumping around like he was 20. More power to him.  It's called entertainment. Who wants to watch a bunch of guys just standing around. Where's the fun in that?  That would be boring.
As far as the production goes?
=================================
Audio is outstanding. I have a very nice home theater and this concert DVD sounded as though I was there. It helps that my speakers are very lively in the first place.
Video production is so-so.  They don't hold a shot for very long, they use these zoom in and zoom out effects way to much. There were times my eyes actually started to get fatigued. Too much giggling around with the camera shots.
Steve, next time get a better video crew. They are the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars.",1076544000,8,1310,4.295546558704453
1945770,4,B0000TSRAQ,"Well, I don't want to bash a product that actually showcases the best of one of the most attractive and colorful personalities in the music industry today. Quirky, wacky, freaky, whatever... Steve Vai is a musician that irradiates so much energy, brainpower, passion and fun that you finally jump with him into his magical world, even if this world is presented through a not-so-good item, such as this DVD itself.
What really surprises me is that Vai is a perfectionist, a guy that respects his work over everything else in the world. And shamefully this DVD is far from being perfect. But let's start by talking about the good things on it:
First of all, the tracklist couldn't be better. Nothing essential was left out. From the opening ""Shy Boy"" (with those amazing tapping duettos with Billy Sheehan!) to the closing ""The Attitude Song"" (with everybody jamming around like a bunch of crazy witches), almost all what you expect to be there, is there: ""Giant Balls of Gold"", ""Bad Horsie"", ""Whispering a Prayer"", ""Jibboon"", ""For the love of God""... and much much much more! I'm no less than EXTREMELY happy with the tracklist, really -well, don't tell me that you wanted to listen to ""Fire Garden Suite"". Of course that one is NOT there :-).
Secondly, the performers are more than amazing. Their live playing is close to perfection without scarifying a dime in attitude. How good they are was captured and proudly packaged into this DVD. Not only Steve Vai himself shines, but also Virgil Donati (what a drum solo! -what a DRUMMER!), Tony MacAlpine (guys, I've never understood why he never got the fame he deserves so well!), Billy Sheehan (the perfect skillful bass player to match Vai on stage) and Dave Weiner (the low-profile dwarf that does everything well and plays the guitar like a god); them all really excel!
Now, the bad things: the synchronization between the video and the music sometimes is lost, and the sound is a tad thin in my opinion; but the worst of everything are those annoying video transitions (so cheap and cheesy!) and those absurd camera moves -which almost ruin the entire production and won't let you see what you really want to see more than once!
In few words, this release contains a lot of good tracks and I still consider it a gem in my collection, but it could have been far better. I just hope that the G3 DVD, produced (I hope) by Sony, will be top-quality and won't leave any bitter taste in my mouth -like ""Live at the Astoria London"" did, though slightly.
So, music and performance: five stars. Image and sound: four stars. Video editing and production: better not say. :-)",1076198400,31,2617,4.728665207877461
1945771,5,B0000TSRAQ,"This is a great expo of Steve Vai and his incredible talent. I've watched this DVD over and over and love it. His playing in incredible. His stage antics are fun, entertaining and moving (you can see he's been influenced by Zappa, DLR and knows how to perform visually). It truly shows off Steve Vai's talent and personality. I was recently at a Guitar Play Magazine party for their advertisers hosted by Steve Vai and truly think he's not only an incredible guitarist but simply radiates life and music.
The DVD itself leaves you in awe. Steve is incredible on his studio recordings but you think: ""how is he going to pull this off live""? Well, he does perfectly. It is like watching Michael Jordan in his prime. Musically, he does a tremendous job of weaving very interesting melodies and layers of sound together. It is not just fast paying here. There are great dynamics at work in his compositions. The guitar is simply his vehicle for creating music. He's not held back at all by the guitar but effortlessly can make any sound he imagines.
Steve's music isn't for everyone. My wife just doesn't get it. It is very complex and takes a truly serious music fan to appreciate. If you're music tastes are limited to the pop flavor of the week, you may not like Vai. If you have an open minded and are looking for something musically on the level of John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Frank Zappa, Beethoven or Bach, then Vai will blow you away.",1076025600,14,1441,4.5675675675675675
1945772,1,B0000TSRAQ,"No doubt, Vai is blessed with ability. Mind blowing speed and tricks out the wazoo. But that doesn't equal music. These songs SUCK. He's a forty something playing and acting like a teenager..I felt embarressed for him and the boys most of the time...
Go buy some Robert Fripp dvd's or Stevie Ray...they're better for your teeth...",1076025600,3,330,4.807017543859649
1945773,3,B0000TSRAQ,"I thought I would review the DVD in terms of ""watchability"" rather than the music.
Clearly, I would not be watching the DVD unless I was a huge Steve Vai fan, and the music is uniformly superb. However, that said, I really feel that Steve is in danger of alienating the older audience with his, there is no other word for it, childish antics.
Stupid sexual parodies, ridiculous costume changes ( who are you really,?  Britney ? ), laughable face pulling, whirling around like an idiot, and general embarrassing behaviour. Old f..t, I hear you say !! Well possibly, but at 50 I have rarely felt so embarrassed for one of my ""heros"" and I actual squirm in my seat watching this DVD. Dave Weiner, Billy Sheehan and Tony MacAlpine don't ""need"" to do it ... why, oh why, does Steve ?
Don't you appreciate that a large portion of your audience has been around the rock scene for years, grown up (ha!) with you, and recognise you as a phenomenal player? YOU DON'T NEED TO SHOWBOAT through every song ... you don't need to embarrass us with your attempts at moon walking, or daft stories about ""I could have been a pop star""!!
I was quite prepared, from the reviews, NOT to like this DVD for the amateur camera work.. Believe me, it is fine, and is not the reason this DVD is difficult to watch.
When I saw Steve last, I was pretty near the front, but I don't remember him making me squirm in the same way this DVD does. Was he trying too hard to ""entertain""? .. Well Steve,  I love you for your brilliance, but take a leaf out of Joe and Steve M's book, and play for us ... that is TRULY more than we can wish for ... and leave the posing and pouting to the 90% of talentless ""pop stars"" that you say you could have been.
You are NOT, thank goodness. Please look at this DVD and put it down as a learning experience. I will listen to it full blast, but that is about all !",1075852800,3,1865,4.235955056179775
1945774,4,B0000TSRAQ,"STEVE VAI LIVE AT THE ASTORIA is a best of Steve Vai on DVD. Yes, it's production values aren't amazing, but if you want cinematography and direction I advise you rent American Beauty, the Godfather or see Lost in Translation. This is a concert video and it should be all about the music. Vai is a creative virtuoso guitarist and all of his best music from the last 2 decades are on this DVD. Included are SHYBOY, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, BLUE POWDER, WHISPERING A PRAYER and many more. Vai has released some discs that I am not a fan of but none of those tunes are on here. There are also a couple of Jimi Hendrix covers. There isn't a Vai favorite missing and no bad songs from his catalog.
Joining Steve for this concert are Dave Weiner on guitar, Virgil Donati on Drums, Tony Macalpine replaces Mike Keneally on Guitar/keyboards and does a commendable job, and rounding out the band is the amazing Billy Sheehan on bass.(The greatest bassist in the rock genre) Each musician is given an opportunity to show his stuff through a solo piece or exchanging fours with Vai. There are even moments of triple unison lines and the use of 3 guitarists recreates multitrack studio songs live without anything missing. This band is one of the greatest collections of talents in a rock band that I've ever seen. Vai has some unreal interplay with Sheehan and it seems as if he never stopped playing with Billy since David Lee Roth. Steve also has some moments of pure insanity with Macalpine and throughout the show Vai displays why he is the inheritor of the Jimi Hendrix/Stevie Ray Vaughn 'school of cool moves' throne. As one of my friends said, 'It is like watching a magic act.'
If you are a Steve Vai fan then you should run out and get this NOW. If you're a guitarist that likes virtuosos and don't own any Vai yet; then this might be the only Vai release that you need. One of the best concert DVD's because the song selection is great. Vai's seemingly unlimited talents are finally brought out in full force.",1075420800,,2004,4.493150684931507
1945775,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Let me start by saying this, if you don't like Steve don't buy it.  It appears many aren't smart enought to get that.  Having said that, this video is perfect for true fans.  You have a true master of his instrument surrounded with what may be the best backup band (if you can call them that) ever.  This video I think goes a long way towards putting Vai in a very elite group of players all time (Hendrix, Vaughan, Satch, Malmsteen, etc.)  He is a showman.  I have Satch's live at San Fran and it has many great songs (I believe Satch may have better melodies in his music) but Vai adds a level of entertainment that rivals Stevie Ray at the El Macambo or any Jimi videos.  I was relieved to determine he wasn't playing Shy Boy blindfolded thougth.  I almost gave up the intrument when I thought he could do that without looking at all.",1075248000,4,837,4.286624203821656
1945776,3,B0000TSRAQ,"I've been listening to vai for 14 years. I guess no one can judge his talent. He has written songs that can blow your head. So There is nothing to say about him and his music.
Well,about The DVD,there is too much to mention.
1.the 5.1 mixing of the DVD is a diseaster,first I thought that there was something wrong with my amplifier settings. You can barely hear vai's guitar at low volumes. You should choose the 2 Channel option and spread the sound to all 5 speakers manually.
2. The effects just spoil your mood.
3. The song list is not so well chosen. Most of the songs are covers from jimi and billy,only a few steve vai's originals.
4. Virgil Donati's drum solo is astonishing. At the end he just sends a message to portnoy saying ""Wanna battle?""
shortly;
The DVD is O.K. but not so superb like satriani's Live in san francisco.",1074988800,3,835,4.393548387096774
1945777,3,B0000TSRAQ,"I was so excited to see this DVD... what guitar enthusiast could pass up 2+ hours of Steve Vai?  I've heard him live, heard him with other artists, heard him by himself, and was amped to hear and see him in my very own home.
The music was simply wonderful, a good variety of songs were chosen, and Vai's energy really comes through to the viewer.  However, I have to mention the nauseating overkill of visual effects used.
As a one-time film/video production student, I learned one thing you NEVER do is mess with the stock footage.  But consistently throughout the DVD you see weird angles, lightning fast zooms, and oh the spinning...
Then there's the post-production debacle.  First of all, it is a bad idea to change subject size or shooting angle so drastically.  It was hard to keep up with what I was watching.  Next, star wipes, swirl wipes, etc. are best left for high school video classes.
Granted, these effects and transitions were often proportional to the tempo and energy of the music at that time, but were very distracting nonetheless.
If the seizure-inducing distractions from the editing and footage were toned down or eliminated, I would have given this five stars.  As it is, I could not in good conscience recommend this to anyone without a thorough warning.
Mr. Vai, please keep doing what you do best... and let the camera operators and editors do what they do best.",1074902400,14,1390,4.695473251028806

1945780,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Famous/imfamous dead music critic Lester Bangs said it ALL when he once said of John McLauglin's 1st solo album ""Extrapolation"" but the quote easily fits Vai today:
""EASILY THE BEST F*#KING GUITARIST I'VE EVER HEARD!""

 This fit's Vai to a T, & the dbl dvd as well!
 I guess you have to be MY AGE to get it? Didn't anyone see Steve Vai when he was with the greatest composer of the past 50 years(Frank Zappa whom coined a new phrase just for Vai, ""Stunt Guitarist"" because Vai could do 'anything' w/a guitar!)FZ, BUT ME? Get over it! Vai's showmanship is not an act! he's been playing that way for over 23 years! This IS how he plays & I find it more refreshing & much harder to do what Vai does, & play how he plays than say an Alan Holdsworth, a great guitarist to listen to, but nothing to veiw!
 As far as the band goes, Vai NEVER had a finer drummer(which Vai basically admits to in the commentary track which is great! Plus every other band member, other than Donati whom was playing has their commentary heard, which is great. Plus MacAlpine has been playing w/Donati in the best, heavy progressive band around ""Planet X"", for 4 years so he should know all about Virg!)than the incredible VIRGIL DONATI! Add the finest bass player in music today, Billy Sheehan, take out the great Mike Kenealy & put in virtouso master TONY MACALPINE on unreal guitar & keys, & throw in a 24 yr old Dave Weiner, on guitar too, & you've got the greatest band playing! WOW! A MUST SEE!!
 I've had these dvd's since the day they were released, & have watched the performance over & over, & I still find myself TOO BUSY enjoying what i'm hearing & seeing to burn 'negitive energy'
on nit picking at any minor flaws on the dvd production or the filming of the event! Hands down this is the greatest guitar or music dvd ever & if you call yourself a guitarist and won't own up to the fact that VAI IS THE BEST, then maybe you'd better rethink your 'status' as a musician or someone whom professes to LOVE electric guitar music.(I've been a professional musician for 34 years, & this is what 'performing' is ALL ABOUT!
 So don't listen to this other crap, it's being spewed by people not smart enough to know real talent, & BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY as you'll love these 2 dvd's! INCREDIBLE!
Btw the performance itself is 2 & 1/2 hrs long! Plus you get a commentary track which is great & informative & funny, plus rehearsals, & lots of other extras! It's just a shame that people outside the U.S. & Canada cannot(at the time of this writing) veiw the dvd's as only NTSC versions have been released! It's also a damned shame that this dvd's general release took 24 months from the day(s) the shows were filmed(Dec. 6th & 7th 2001)at the Astoria until Dec. 04! I feel for ya Paul, cause you've been waiting since you saw these shows(actually 3!)LIVE & still don't have the dvd ready for you to purchase!)

1945781,4,B0000TSRAQ,"When Metallica's S&M Dvd came out, I was amazed with the feature of watching one member in the band at a time.  This continued on with another great buy (albeit only on 3 songs) Rush in Rio.  Steve Vai is an amazing guitar player.  The editing is downright annoying most of the time, seeing Steve's facial expressions more often than his fluid and amazing finger work on the guitar.  Most guitarists will enjoy this more than most people because hey, it's Steve Vai.  Being a bassist, the few tauntings of watching Billy Sheehan are also greatly worth the effort, as he has some amazing solo spots as well.  All in all, Steve's crazy antics are amusing, and its well worth it to see Steve play some of his greatests.  Although, would love to have a camera selector for some of the songs as the DVD's above.  That's what a concert's really about, focusing on one person at a time (especially when we're talking about musician super groups like Steve's band).  Not to drive a point to death but some of the camera angles, and camera angle changes, would send some epileptics into a seizure.  Oh well, great music.",1074384000,2,1111,4.565656565656566

I read people complaining on the net about the camera work and it is a definitely valid complaint (even Steve will admit so), but I don't think it takes away from the show at all.  Others complain you don't get enough shots of both of Steve's Hands at the same time.  Well, for those expecting some kind of instructional video, that's prbably right but I didn't buy it for that reason.  It's a concert video.
The 5.1 audio sounds absolutely fantastic.  DVD highlights for me are Shyboy, Fire, Whispering a Prayer and Jibboom.
Highly recommended if you are Vai and aren't looking for an instructional video but a great audio experience.",1074384000,,717,4.741935483870968

I agree with a couple of other reviewers who were distracted be the horrible editing, bad transitions and wipes.  If you can get past that, then you should enjoy 90 percent of this DVD.  Steve and his band are amazing.  Great players with great stage presence, but of course, Steve goes a little too far with some of his onstage antics, some personality is great, but gyrating with your guitar between your legs is too much!

1945788,3,B0000TSRAQ,"I'm not a huge Vai fan, but I've followed his career since the ""Crossroads"" movie.  I own a few of his albums and have also seen him live on G3.  The latter was my main reason to own this DVD, as the band setup is the same.  In a nutshell, the audio on this album is awesome (if you don't count the vocals), but everything else is a  bit disappointing.
As stated many times, the visuals are amateurish at best.  The camera is jumpy and often focuses on the wrong thing.  There are a few cheesy effects thrown in, and it even intentionally blurs a few times (I picture Homer Simpson with his home ""Star Wipe"" editing system).  Steve himself also is quite hammy.  He's got a face full of sparkle glitter, and frequently hustles offstage for funky costume changes (including cyborg-laser man).  He also does several Hendrix-esque feedback odysseys which aren't really my cup of tea.  Give me the simple straight forward attitude of the G3 concert any day.  I also find Disc 2 on the disappointing side.  It contains some decent stuff (rehearsals), but is primarily filled with silly little interviews where everyone's trying to be a comedian.
While nowhere near the quality of Satriani's live DVD, this is still probably a must-have for serious Vai fans.  For casual fans and guitar aficionados like myself, it's more of a close call.  Despite its shortcomings, it gets one thing right - fantastic audio.",1073433600,5,1401,4.688524590163935
1945789,5,B0000TSRAQ,"This DVD is amazing. It is one of the best I have ever seen. Steve Vai is the best guitarist I have ever heard. I used to think it was Satriani,but after watching this,I changed my mind. The band on here is incredible. It was a similar band to when I saw him at G3 last year. The only difference is that Jeremy Colson played drums instead of Virgil Donati. They are both equally good. The highlight of this 2 and 1/2 hour performance is the extended version of ""The Attitude Song"".All of his guitarists and Billy Sheehan,with special guest Eric Sardinas,get a solo. My only complaint is that it is too long. It is 1 hour shorter than the whole G3 show. Plus,why do they give Tony a keyboard solo instead of a guitar solo?He is a great keyboard player,but guitar is his main thing. Anyway,if you like good guitar playing,buy this DVD,plus check the new G3 DVD and CD,which comes out in February",1073433600,3,893,4.418181818181818
1945790,1,B0000TSRAQ,"I saw Steve Vai live for the first time at the Greek Theater in Hollywood during the 2003 G3 Tour and became instantly aware of his talents. Steve clearly has put in a life time of sweat, dedication and artistic consciousness into is craft, as was obvious from the reaction and outright appreciation from everyone that was present at the concert that night. Steve surrounds himself with like-talented musicians and technicians who no doubt have been selected from a list of thousands of personalities. My point for this opening commentary is to point out that Steve clearly did not surround himself with anyone remotely talented in the videography and/or DVD production industry for the making of this DVD. I find it incredibly ironic that the production team of choice would have little to no experience and yet, find a way to still be associated with Steve Vai's prestigious team.
This DVD has all the appearances of a bad 1st year high school video project; complete with 1st time videographers who think it's cool to perform special effects during actual taping, rather than afterwards during post production. Then, it seems, these same 1st year videography students took their already destroyed raw footage to the student post production/editing team. This genius team furthered their special effects training by performing everything the video editing software had to offer. Every transition, special effect, massive zoom, twists and swirls, etc., they did it all. (didn't want the videographers to have all the glory). This production reminded me of the Saturday Night Live  - Wayne's World skit when Wayne stops the progress of his show by requesting, ""unnecessary zoom, unnecessary zoom!!""... The camera would zoom in and out in rapid succession, close enough to see the skin pores on Wayne's forehead. Clearly, the zoom-in/tight shots for this concert were designed to produce the same effect. I now know more about the fine hairs on Steve Vai's knuckles than his actual guitar playing.
If there's any consolation to this experimental release, the DD 5.1 sound track is pretty good (clear, nice overall mix), and if you close your eyes, you'll actually enjoy the concert. Too bad this production is so poor. If I had not had the privilege of seeing him live, I would think Steve Vai was just another startup band operating on a shoe-string budget, trying to make it. Steve needs to rethink the talent behind his video production team. I can only hope that there's some salvageable footage left on those video tape reels that might allow a REAL production team the opportunity to re-release this concert.",1073088000,2,2613,5.034642032332563
1945791,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Wow!! What an awesome DVD! This is an unbelievable show and a must-have for any Vai fan. Over 2 hours of Steve Vai...what more is there to say?
 On the 'Alive In An Ultra World' cd's, it was great to hear his new stuff, but now to see him play many of the best tunes from that cd is even greater...""Giant Balls Of Gold"", ""Blood And Glory"", Whispering A Prayer"" and ""Incantation"". As great as those songs are, the highest point for me on this DVD was ""The Crying Machine"" and ""The Animal"". Awesome tracks on the studio cd, but mind altering live. Every song on this DVD is altered with extended guitar work and Billy Sheehan showing why he is accompanying Mr. Vai.
 The only thing I would change is a couple of songs I didn't care for, for one reason or another...""Shyboy"" with Billy Sheehan singing? Could've done without that, but an appropriate opener, I guess. Tony Macalpine's keyboard solo bored me and made me feel like I was watching a funeral. I also did not care for ""Chameleon"", a song from Sheehan's solo album...music is good on this song, but would trade for most any other Vai tune. I would've like to have seen any of these replaced by ""Touching Tongues"", ""Blowfish"" or even better ""Juice"".
 Those moments are few and far between, though. I give this DVD 5 stars and highly recommend it. I extracted the audio from the DVD and burned it on 2 audio cd's to listen to in my car.",1072915200,,1391,4.404669260700389

1945793,3,B0000TSRAQ,"I decided to hold off on writing this review until I could fully digest the material.  From a performance standpoint, the band are nothing short of brilliant.  Having never seen Vai in concert, this was jaw dropping.  Every member of this band really pulls his weight.  Vai of course is stellar not just as a musician but as an entertainer as well.  To me the choice of material didn't really matter, because they played their hearts out on every single piece.
Alas this dvd is not without its flaws.  As a videographer I can appreciate the blood that the crew sweats to come up with a final product.  Having said that, I found some of the editorial decisions made in piecing this together questionable.  For starters the transitions from frame to frame are often ""childish"" - that is to say 'effects used for the sake of eye candy'. It gets a little tiresome after a while and one begins to wonder whether the editor was discovering these effects for the first time.  Secondly, I was not too happy with the 'shot selection' itself.  During 'Little Wing' was there any need to include a shot (for the vast majority of the song, I might add) of a fretboard closeup, that is totally OUT OF FOCUS?  Shots that are blurry are useless to all (esp the guitarists) who scrutinise this footage.  The same can be said of shots where Vai's back is to the camera for relatively long durations (esp during a solo!)
Finally, I would have preferred Dave Weiner's guitar actual output sound to have been higher.  He can barely be heard!  This is more of an issue with the people in charge of sound on the night though.
Vai fans should pick up this dvd not as a tribute to the footage itself, but as a salute to the 5 musicians who graced the Astoria and brought the roof down!  I only wish I could have seen this is person.",1072742400,3,1808,4.4363636363636365
1945794,5,B0000TSRAQ,"well, i was expecting this dvd like my pay check, and it was AWESOME. i've seen vai a few times before, and his showmanship (and playing, i think, but im in no place to judge him) has gotten ever better. the concert was possibly one of the most amazing things ever. Billy Sheehan is sick! SICK! SICK!! Tony kickass! when i first saw him i had the impression that he wasn't as good as kennelly, until Tony had his solo...it was kind of dissappointing that they didn't play many songs with piano/guitar duet. anywho, dave wiener was just as amazing, i've never see a three part guitar harmony that was played that fast (tapping at top speed), and i've never heard a tap harmonic on a bass guitar played that clearly before. ok, enough about the concert, cuz the previous guys covered it pretty well, its really the production of the DVD that some of the previous guys have bumps with. i agree that the camera was rather shaky, some of the shots weren't as well taken as they should've been. many people also compared it to Satriani's live in san francisco. well, my justification for the camera crew was that....as we all know, steve jumps around on stage like NUTS and we love him for it, unlike satch who just stand there and play. but sometimes, that makes it a little harder for the cameraman to get a special, steady shot of his playing hand, understandable? i think yes. that only pick i have about the DVD is the excess special effects. i think it would've been fine without some of the twisting and skewing. other than that, this DVD is perfect....i watched....well, over and over",1072396800,3,1586,4.529616724738676
1945795,3,B0000TSRAQ,"Greg Bradelle's review was pretty much on the money. As a fan of Steve Vai, I was looking forward to an entire DVD devoted to his performance. Unfortunately, nobody told the camera crew that it was not THEIR show. I'm sure the poor slobs who filmed the Cream's Farewell Concert didn't realize they were butchering historical concert footage either, but time has proven them wrong. The performance by Steve and crew was plenty exciting without the addition of all this photographic chicanery.
The experience of TRYING to watch the concert was an exercise in futility and frustration.
At one point in the concert, Steve playfully takes a camera away from one of the ""photographers.""
Too bad, he gave it back.",1072396800,,706,4.891666666666667
1945796,5,B0000TSRAQ,"I saw Steve and Billy the first time when I was about 10 or 11 back around...86? when they toured with David Lee Roth. I've also seen Billy with Mr Big and Steve with Whitesnake. They were great then and they're great now. Steve also has Tony Mcalpine in the band as well as his ever faithful sidekick Dave Wiener(spelling?). Not to mention Virgil Donanti on drums.
 I've seen the G3 tours and of course one can't help but be impressed. I truely dig the fact that Steve gives all his other bandmates some of the spotlight. And really lates them shine. This is the one area that I think is superior to the Satriani DVD which is also very good but he didn't really let his banmates have the same oppertunity as Steve did his. The Showmanship is first rate while the musicianship is also first rate. Usually bands have to sacrifice one for the other but Steve and his bandmates seem to be able to have thier cake and eat it too. I guess my only gripe about this DVD(and believe me this is very small) is that on the bonus DVD they didn't have an interview with Steve himself. That having been said, there's still ample bonus material and of course a great show on the main dvd which is well worth the price itself. The concert is full of astounding musicianship, humor, and showmanship we have all come to expect and love of Mr Vai. He does not come up short this this. If you are a Steve Vai fan, you need this. You will not be disapointed.",1072396800,,1438,4.286764705882353

Everything on this DVD was perfect, and I dunno what that other guy was talking about, the camera situation was fine, plenty of Vai hand shots.
All the players on this DVD are all VERY talented in what they do. I was surprised by Tony MacAlpine and Dave Weiner, as I'd never heard of them before; they are just awesome.
For the usual Vai antics, this is definitely the DVD of choice, I saw some things on here I'd never seen done before, totally jaw dropping..

1945798,5,B0000TSRAQ,"You know, It takes a lot to get those ""excitement chills"" running down my spine...watching this video has me in pain because it is JUST SO GOOD! I saw Steve Vai live on this past Oct's G3 Tour. I remember it like it was yesterday, and this DVD brought me right back to it. The way the Steve Plays, there is just something about him that is surreal. I am thoroughly convinced he is not a creation from this world. The way he has a bond with everyone in his band is incredible. He's not a ham though, he lets everyone have their 15 minutes of fame...and WHAT a 15 Minutes! There is so much talent in this band, it's not funny. Virgil has to be one of the best drummers I have ever seen (and I have seen a LOT of drummers), Billy Sheenan is an incredible bassist, one of my favorites besides the uber-talented Danny Lohner from Nine Inch Nails, McAlpine is a smoooth keyboardist, I would second him to DT's Derek Sherinian. Dave Weiner, what's not to love about him? Talented on a seven string and a sitar, very cool.
Enough about the band. Im sure if you are checking this out, you already know how amazing this band is...
The DVD is a great deal. The full set including a feature-length commentary by the band (most of it is entertaining, if not entertaining). The camera work is great, but I think Mr. Vai needs some more lessons on Final Cut Pro (not that Im knocking it, Im a video editor, Im as picky about films as anything), but his special effects aren't too annoying or anything. If I had to have one complaint, I would say that I wish they had actual interviews with the guys instead of text. Text is boring! Other than that, incredible deal.
Cliff Notes Version:
God-like Guitarist and Amazing Band rock your socks off for a few hours. Lots of extra features and great quality. A Must Have for all rock music lovers. Doesn't matter what kind, as they have their own style.
Here's hoping for the G3 DVD early next year. Merry Christmas.",1072310400,,1944,4.358126721763085

Highly recommend!",1071878400,,133,5.090909090909091
1945800,5,B0000TSRAQ,"I loved this DVD!!  As for the review here from the guy who thought he was buying a guitar instructional video, yes I would like to see more full guitar shots but this is not anywhere near as bad as he put it!!!!!!!!!  Again he must have thought he was getting an instructional video!  The song choices were cool enough and the extras rocked too!  It sounds nice and live and loud! Do yourself a favor and get this to put right next to your Satch and Dream Theater DVDS.",1071705600,,470,4.188888888888889
1945801,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Bottom Line: Buy DVD and enjoy.  Can't think of many other better ways of spending my time or $.
Saxophone - John Coltrane; Basketball - Michael Jordan; Slide guitar - Duane Allman; Fretted guitar - Steve Vai.  My point is that Steve is arguably one of the best guitarists of all-time.  Although Steve Vai might NOT be better than Hendrix, or Stevie Ray Vaughan, or Andres Segovia, or Charlie Christian.  I strongly doubt that the aforementioned guitarists are better than Steve.
Similar to the people (not just guitarists) that I've mentioned, Steve has the technical skills & passion for his art.  Equally important is his quest to explore.
In closing, Steve is a wonderful human being, an honest and imaginative musician, and a FREAKING ANIMAL (that is, he's both a freak and an animal....)",1071187200,,793,4.888059701492537
1945802,5,B0000TSRAQ,"Not to diminish the rest of the band who play beyond human ability but Steve Vai & Billy Sheehan has the on-stage charisma that today's MTV pop stars would sell their souls for (that is the label doesn't already own their souls).
This DVD is THE best concert DVD I have ever seen. I find most concert DVD's to be kind of boring. Especially of this guitar virtusos genre. It takes so much talent and concentration to pay this type of difficult guitar music; one has to limit his stage antics so as to not screw up. Ever see Pat Metheny or King Crimson do anything other than stand in one place and play a song that involved 5 different time signatures, 3 different keys for a duration more than 10 minutes?
What I really enjoyed was Steve allowing the rest of the band to show off their chops. There is a temptation for the front man to steal the spotlight. Here, Steve shares the show with each individual member. Though Steve's stage antics are rather silly and over the top and I could have done without Tony MacAlpine's dreadful keyboard solo. Why not let him solo on guitar? One other item - sorry Steve but you cannot play blues. I love ya and you are incredible but blues is not your specialty.
I've seen Steve three times, twice solo and once with Zappa (back when he was in his early twenties) and have always left his concerts with the feeling that I've seen the best. This DVD captures the intensity, excitement and musicianship of a Steve Vai show. If you're friends shake their heads when you go on about Steve Vai, let them see this DVD and they will know why he is the top man of the rock guitar virtuoso genre. They may not become a rabid Vai fan, but they will see why Steve Vai is able to make a living without the aid of MTV, radio play or slick commercialism and marketing - which is a tough thing to do these days.
His guitar, his music and his writing speaks for itself.",1071014400,7,1891,4.314606741573034

8002808,5,B0000TSRAQ,"I loved it. Completely original.  Unlike anything that I've ever seen or heard.  The drummer put on an awesome drum solo but Steve Vai is so spontaneous that it kind of seems like that some of the concert was unrehearsed and the drummer seemed to be stuck with consistant 2/4, 4/4,1/3,and few 6/8 counts and seemed monotonous.  Maybe the drummer was hired for the tour and didn't have time to really prepare.  And it seemed like the drummer had very few drum fill rolls or originality and appeared to desperately cover it up by bombarding his cymbals with what should have been drum filled rolls on his toms and syncopation with the cymbals. overall, the show was awesome and I recommend it. Steve Vai is hard to follow, I'm sure any drummer will agree.",1479081600,,753,4.597014925373134

I am really speechless ... just watching his virtuosity, his profound sense of musicianship, leaves me without words. I totally love this guy and his playing. I do admit Vai is not for everyone, nor even for any occasion. I am now in a place where I dig it, although in the past I was not that much interested. But if you are attracted to this, this has to be the top of the mountain where only a very few can climb.",1452470400,,502,3.9313725490196076
