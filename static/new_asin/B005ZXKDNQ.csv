8490059,5,B005ZXKDNQ,"A nice short low-budget film that excellently depicts reasons why a woman may engage in a polygamous relationship and reasons for her leaving. Great insight on the emotions of the women involved, with some humorous tidbits throughout make this film about secret  lives irresistible to watch. Having heard general ideas on polygamy when I was younger, this was the first film I had ever seen that actually talked about what polygamy was like, before the big hype of polygamous shows like Big Love or those reality TV shows were ever made.",1391990400,,537,4.9010989010989015
8490060,5,B005ZXKDNQ,"This indie film has a lot of information in a small space. The movie is not long, a great deal of emotion is conveyed in the performances.  Rather then focusing on the fundamentals and the religious nature of the religious sect, the film centers on the emotional turmoil that one person experienced in her journey. The film supports the universal need for love and the need for acceptance. There is a lack of judgment on the religious aspect and instead the viewers experience one woman's journey and her own decisions in life. The only drawback is that the movie is too short and there seems to be more ""behind the scenes"" that the viewer is missing, On the other hand, the film allows is an emotional expression of a lifestyle. The film accomplishes its goal-to peek inside and experience a journey and there is a sense of overcoming that ends the film successfully.",1391731200,3,868,4.673202614379085
8490061,3,B005ZXKDNQ,"I found this look ""behind the scenes"" of what living in polygamy is like to be fascinating. It's a short film, though, so would have loved some more in depth. Liked the personal insight from someone who had done this and revelations about the politics in a house with multiple wives that didn't dwell just on the physical relationships.",1391644800,4,336,4.711864406779661
