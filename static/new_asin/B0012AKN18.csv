8244936,5,B0012AKN18,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this reading and have learned many significant things from the video and associated workbook regarding the group therapeutic experience.  This was the required materials for graduate level group counseling theory course in counseling psychology. A partial list of topics that were explored in the video/workbook by Corey et. al., are: group ethics; stages of the group and specific exercises and techniques that can be used in each of different stages; specific characteristics and skills of a positive group leader;  I also learned about potential challenges to foresee or expect in a group experience as well as problem behaviors, problematic situations; as well as numerous, additional interesting topics.

Additionally, what follows are some of the video/workbook topics that stood out with particular significance for me.  I would say that I have enjoyed this video and workbook as much as any or perhaps even more than others I have used. I truly enjoyed witnessing the authentic emotions, feelings, and experiences of individuals working together in the group exercises in the video.  I think that group work can be extremely difficult, yet at the same time also highly fulfilling and satisfying.  The use of the group counseling video proved to me that online education and the use of technology - although not equal - can come close to replicating real life group counseling interactions, yet through a web-based or technological medium.

The core learning topics that you will learn with this video and workbook are:

1. The power of a well-led group.

I learned this from the powerful experiences viewing the video, from observing individuals in the Corey group disclose personal, oftentimes intimate information.  You will most likely be impacted by the emotional and change-provoking situations that participants encounter.  I was impressed by how both Marianne and Gerald Corey (the workbook authors and group therapy leaders in the video) interacted with the group and how they operated.  They have a specific methodology and theoretical orientation (which are outlined in their texts) that I feel are quite powerful for cultivating collaborative self-work.

2. Results producing group leaders have certain identifiable characteristics and qualities that encourage change.

You will learn that effective group leaders are observant, attentive, good listeners, compassionate and have a certain sense and sensitivity to be able to know when to say just enough to coax discussion without being overbearing, intrusive or authoritarian.  This workbook and video serve as a good beginning for learning how to become an effective therapeutic group leader.

3.  A group takes on certain defined characteristics, even a certain ""power,"" that also is described as ""therapeutic force.""

In Western psychological terms it has been described as collective consciousness; in Eastern philosophy and healing it has been described as collective Ch'i or lifeforce.  In other words the whole of the group experience can become larger than the sum of its parts.

To reiterate,  I had a great experience using the group counseling video and workbook and believe it would be beneficial for anyone's future endeavors in the counseling field.  I certainly recommend the workbook and video as reference works in the field.",1242691200,,3338,5.415860735009671
