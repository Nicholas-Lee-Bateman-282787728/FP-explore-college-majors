3838044,2,B0021L8UHQ,"Ads and trailers for ""12 Rounds"" the new action film starring wrestler John Cena proudly proclaim ""from the director of 'Die Hard 2'"". I think that in the very near future, we will witness some ads for television shows proudly proclaiming ""from the director of 'Die Hard 2'"". ""12 Rounds"" makes ""Die Hard 2"" look like Shakespeare.

Police officers Danny Fisher (Cena) and Hank Carver (Brian White) are out on patrol when they get word that the FBI is tracking international terrorist, Miles Jackson (Aiden Gillen, HBO's ""The Wire"", the British version of ""Queer as Folk"") through the French Quarter. Danny is a little out of it as he and his girlfriend, Molly (Ashley Scott) have just moved into a place, together, living together for the first time, and she is already talking about marriage. Driving through the Ninth Ward, they come to a red light next to a BMW driven by a beautiful woman. Danny quickly realizes he has seen this woman in surveillance footage of Miles, she is Miles' girlfriend, and they pursue the car. One thing leads to another and these two officers, but more so Danny, have arrested Miles and his girlfriend is dead. A year later, Danny and Hank have been promoted to Detective and still work together trying to keep the streets of New Orleans safe. As Danny leaves his house, he gets a phone call from Miles. Miles has escaped from prison and wants to play a little game. If Danny follows the instructions and is successful, he will get Molly back. Miles wants to take away the thing Danny loves most in retaliation for the death of his girlfriend. As Danny listens to this message, he realizes he has no choice and begins racing through the streets of New Orleans, trying to keep up with the madman's requests. Along the way, he gets Hank involved and the FBI agents who botched the original arrest, hard as nails Special Agent George Aiken (Steve Harris, TV's ""The Practice"") and his more compassionate partner Special Agent Ray Santiago (Gonzalvo Menendez) insist on becoming involved. But what is Miles really after?

Directed by Renny Harlin (""Die Hard II"", ""Cliffhanger"", ""Cutthroat Island"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight""), the new film certainly has all of the action elements that made Harlin's good films so memorable. But ""12 Rounds"" also has all of the bad elements that made Harlin's bad films so very, very terrible.

But let's start with Cena. This is his second film and the wrestler is being groomed to become a movie star. But from the first moment he appears on screen, you immediately realize he has to have been a wrestler; he is massive and looks like an oak tree, so it will be difficult for him to play a variety of roles. But I don't say this simply because of his physical stature. I say this because of his lack of screen charisma. He is always so serious, so dour, so intent, so joyless I don't expect he will ever be able to cross over to dramas or romance or comedies. He may get typecast in action roles, the type of films where he is always a detective, always in the army (special ops) or always someone out to get the bad guys. I suspect he may become the next Sylvester Stallone. When he has one hit film, his career will be made from countless sequels.

Cena certainly appears earnest in his attempted portrayal of Danny. But he never really seems to have any chemistry with Molly, the love of his life. In fact, he simply looks scared every time they appear together on screen. Maybe this is the wrestler's subconscious signifying his fear of actually portraying love, but he simply seems awkward.

In ""12 Rounds"", he isn't given the opportunity to do anything over than look serious or worry about something. Maybe this was a smart choice by the filmmakers. In the beginning, he and Hank are chasing Miles and his girlfriend. When Miles has been arrested, we flash forward a year and Miles begins pulling the strings attached to Danny, working him like the puppet the terrorist wants him to be. So, for almost two hours, Danny is chasing something, or trying to put out a fire, while careening through the streets of New Orleans. He is never given the chance to change emotions, to smile, to laugh, to try to be romantic. Maybe the filmmakers realized he doesn't have the ability to show these finer acting skills. Yep. Definitely the next Stallone.

Aiden Gillen walks through the film like a maniacal puppet master. He always appears bemused and he has every right to; everyone is doing exactly what he wants, how he wants, when he wants. His plan is working perfectly. Actually, too perfectly. Miles Jackson clearly spent the year in prison working out every detail of this complex plan. Gillen gives Jackson the right touch of laissez fair, the right tone to be a villain. I could almost enjoy Gillen's performance (the villains are always the most interesting characters anyway) if it weren't so textbook. I can imagine Gillen looking up the definition of ""arch villain"" in the dictionary and pulling all of his character's traits from that brief definition. But at least he appears to be having fun. That puts him a couple of steps ahead of the rest of the group.

Because his plan is going so perfectly, it robs ""Rounds"" of some suspense. If everything is too easy, why do we care? The best action films present some moments of danger to both the hero and villain, giving each of them a temporary leg up on the other.

From the beginning, when we see the completely inept FBI agents botch Jackson's arrest, we quickly see the two agents each have one personality trait and Steve Harris (who was on TV's ""Boston Legal"") has a hard time making that one work. But Harris' FBI agent is on a mission and seems to have a personal vendetta against Jackson (both commonly accepted traits for FBI agents to have in motion pictures) and doesn't seem to care how much collateral damage he leaves in the wake of his quest. The performance is pretty textbook and pretty laughable. How many people will the FBI let get injured or killed in their quest?

You've heard the term 'everything old is new again'? It's pretty common. But in the case of ""12 Rounds"", everything old is still old. And if something is just too much of a stretch to be believable, Harlin goes with it anyway and simply expects us to go along for the ride. This is generally the case with action films, but it's generally a good idea for the filmmakers to earn our belief, to make these moments at least semi-believable. Harlin doesn't do that in this film.

Danny and Santiago have to stop a runaway streetcar before it hits an outdoor celebration and a little girl standing directly in the way. The way they stop the streetcar? Laughable. At least they refrained from naming the streetcar Desire.

And Harlin seems to have borrowed every trick in the book for this routine action film. It has all the elements you would suspect from a high-octane thrill ride; improbable stunts, quick cutting, over the top danger and credibility stretching situations. But again, everything feels like it is created from a textbook. In fact, Harlin seems to have adopted, stolen, and borrowed from Tony Scott's frantic directing style. ""12 Rounds"" looks remarkably like Scott's ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"", which was also filmed in New Orleans, both post-Katrina. Both films make use of the ferry crossing from Algiers to the Big Easy, both films use the Ninth Ward, both films use Scott's trademark 2-second rule; if a shot lasts for more than two seconds, its too long and you need to cut. In many instances, these cuts are to another angle of the same scene, or to the same shot, just a few seconds later or pushed slightly forward. Scott's camera is always moving and so is Harlin's never sitting on a single subject for long, keeping our attention moving to a new place all the time. This is annoying when Tony Scott does it, and Scott is a better director.

Harlin needs to create another original action film like he did in ""Cliffhanger"", perhaps the one truly memorable film on his resume. To do that, he needs to conceive an idea and figure out a way to blow our minds, to create something new and exciting. He also needs to shy away from projects produced by people trying to create something out of nothing. WWE Studios, the people behind Wrestle mania and all of the pay per view wrestling matches produce ""12 Rounds"". Cena is a former 'title holder'. WWE thinks Cena can become a movie star, so they have produced his first two films. Harlin needs to find someone with talent, a statement I find strange to make considering his most memorable film stars Sylvester Stallone.

If he doesn't, we'll soon see his name attached to an action series premiering on Fox. Soon. Very soon.",1239753600,9,8696,4.672109732201176

Danny Fisher is thrust into a deadly game a year after he arrested an arms dealer named Miles Jackson. Miles kidnaps his girlfriend, and gives Danny 12 things to do. He must solve terrible puzzles, race against time, make sacrifices to save Molly. I love when he drove around in the fire truck, because my dad used to be a Fireman, until he retired.

3838577,3,B0021L8UHQ,"Action movies are one of my many weaknesses. I love a good adrenaline-packed thriller as much as the next person. 12 Rounds is nothing spectacular and has even been accused of having the same plot as the third Die Hard film, with minor changes. That may be true, but it is also tremendously entertaining.

Miles Jackson (Gillen) is one of the most desirable international terrorists in the market. Ruthless and almost untraceable due to his extensive intelligence and unlimited resources, he runs amuck of local authorities while attempting to evade federal custody. In the chaos that follows, his lover is killed and as he is taken away, he warns the officer indirectly responsible that he will pay for his actions. Haunted by this, Detective Danny Fisher (Cena) attempts to resume his normal life but a year later, Jackson escapes from prison. Planting a bomb in the detective's house and snatching his girlfriend, he informs Fisher that they are going to play a little game... he must complete twelve rounds in order to save his girlfriend's life.

While racing from one destination to the next and attempting to unravel the complicated threads the terrorist has left for him, Danny is determined not only to rescue Molly (Scott) but also bring Jackson down. For the most part, this film has its predictable moments in the sense that it follows a familiar formula popular in the director's previous works, but there is also some originality in how the characters are played. Cena is not a professional actor but isn't bad -- I didn't know until afterward that he's actually a pro-wrestler, which explains some of his incredible feats of strength. He has nice chemistry with the leading lady and the supporting cast is quite good, but the real gem of the production is Gillen. His character is arrogant but playful, ruthless and without a conscience but demanding of an apology for past wrongs. He bounces and sneers his way through the part and my only complaint is that we don't see enough of him.

Admittedly, this movie borrows heavily from other productions but does have a decent twist ending and good special effects. One hair-raising scene atop a runaway trolley is particularly intense. There is quite a lot of violence but no blood. Explosions destroy buildings and elevator shafts, sometimes with people in them. A woman is hit by a car (impact unseen, but we see her bloodied form afterward). Policemen and security guards are shot and killed; two men are stabbed. There is a knock-down, drag-out fight. Profanity is less than expected but does contain one muffled abuse of Jesus' name and four uses of GD. There is some mild innuendo. Danny and Molly are unmarried but share a house. We see a few women in bikinis at a hotel. Jackson is unconcerned by collateral damage and innocent civilians often become casualties. Danny attempts to save whomever he can but also endangers lives through recklessness.

I have one further complaint to offer -- I did not like the filming style at all. Shaky camera work takes me out of a film rather than forces me into it, and there are such extreme close-ups and movement in some of the key action sequences that it's difficult to see what is happening. It actually made one person I saw it with motion sick. It seemed a case of creativity infringing on storytelling abilities and while some of the camera work was neat, and the editing was excellent in transitioning between scenes, it seemed to detract from the plot. That aside, it was not an especially intelligent film (although does have a fun twist toward the end, and the ""game"" Jackson sets up for Danny is constantly mentally manipulative) but it was a lot of fun. I enjoy putting aside intense scrutiny for a couple of hours and engaging in an adrenaline ride. Especially with a cocky Irish villain pulling the strings.",1363824000,,3832,4.828006088280061

However, this one was significantly more entertaining than that unremarkable bore.  They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; if that's the case, Bruce Willis and Jeremy Irons should take this film as a compliment.  It's obvious that this movie is very similar to ""Die Hard with a Vengeance,"" but if the filmmakers were going to copy something, at least they picked a stellar action movie to mimic.  The plot concerns a brilliant sociopath seeking revenge on a New Orleans police officer by leading him on a deadly game of puzzles and traps around the city.  Like its spiritual predecessor, ""12 Rounds"" has some spectacular scenes of action and destruction.  Stuff goes boom, guns are fired, vehicles chase each other while narrowly avoiding horrific crashes, and sometimes all three happen simultaneously.  If you're a fan of slam-bang action movies, check it out.",1308700800,,1004,5.085365853658536
3838592,4,B0021L8UHQ,"If you shuffled together the scripts for Speed and Die Hard 3, and split it in two you'd have Daniel Kunka's script for 12 Rounds. The similarities are striking, and too numerous to list. But as a crash-and-burn action film it is very entertaining, has many exiting scenes, and features a charismatic villain. Unfortunately, John Cena, as the troubled hero, is about as emotive as a draft excluder (one of those long, stuffed snakes...remember those?). Cena is likeable, but he's very, very, very far from being an accomplished actor.

One year after busting an international terrorist, New Orleans cop Danny Fisher is thrown into an impossible gauntlet when the criminal breaks out of jail. He must survive twelve rounds of increasingly difficult challenges in order to save his kidnapped girlfriend. The crook himself is Miles Jackson (played nicely by Aidan Gillen), a criminal mastermind who plays the deadly game fast and loose. As I said, he's a great villain, and one that you might partially side with after the accidental death of his girlfriend during the opening.

Renny Harlin has been slumming it for a while now. Ever since Cutthroat Island tanked he's had a hard time keeping his career afloat. When one watches all of his movies from different eras it becomes clear that the man has no style of his own and simply emulates whatever the current trend happens to be. His effort in 12 rounds is merely a pastiche of all the usual CSI/Michael Bay moves. The camera never sits still, regardless of whether or not it's appropriate to the scene. Trevor Rabin provides a rather generic score, but has a couple of nice, repeating themes that bring more emotion to the scenes than Cena is able to show.

12 Rounds will never win awards or even earn itself any particular distinction among action movies, but when you're having this much fun, who cares?

I am glad I did not read the other reviews before I watched the movie.
Yes, the movie has its faults, but it was as I expected by looking at the cover: lots of fast-paced action. I do not know anything about John Cena or WWE, and I saw nothing that detracted from the movie relating to wrestling.

What I hate about the disc is the heavy-handededness of the disc producer/manufacturer. I was FORCED to watch the previews... I could not go directly to the menu, I could not fast forward through them, and I could not skip to the next chapter. This is the first disc I have come across where this is the case, and I will not keep it in my collection. I actually turned off my TV and waited for the previews to finish before I turned it back on. I think I am going to return it to the studio that produced it, and this review is my way of letting them know my displeasure. It is unfair to give the movie itself a poor rating for the software used to cram ads down our throats, but perhaps if all discs that are encoded like that are given bad reviews...

3838619,2,B0021L8UHQ,"John Cena is a New Orleans police detective Danny Fisher, whose girlfriend Molly Porter (Ashley Scott) is abducted by Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen), a sadistic criminal he arrested exactly one year before. Miles forces Danny to take part in his ""12-round game"" that involves a series of fast-paced, life-or-death situations, and the detective must succeed in completing all the challenges from the kidnapper on the other side of the phone.

The premise of Renny Harlin-directed film sounds very familiar for those who have seen the much superior 1995 action film: ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance."" Also, the material of each ""round"" seems ripped off from another action film ""Speed"": elevator shaft, explosive devices, vehicles that cannot stop, the hero's partner, and so on. I know originality is hard to come by, and rehashing old ideas is not a bad thing at all, but things went too far in ""12 Rounds.""

But what really disappointed me is something else, like, acting from some of the players. (no, not John Cena, but Ashley Scott in the climax scene); shaky camera that doesn't know when to stop moving around; and action direction by Renny Harlin, who, despite some nice works from the stunt team, just doesn't know how to build up tension. His hectic camera often fails to show what is happening to the cardboard characters we don't really care. This is disappointing as I still like Renny Harlin's earlier films such as ""Long Kiss Good Night.""

""12 Rounds"" is based on a story and action set-pieces as ridiculous as those of the Geena Davis / Samuel L. Jackson action film, but with much less chemistry between the characters. Watching Jackson and Davis together (or Jackson and Bruce Willis in the third ""Die Hard"" film for that matter) was such fun, and that is what is missing here.",1283817600,,1788,4.855737704918033

A tour de force movie with chases, crashed cars, out of control tramway. A well made thriller directed by the talented Renny Harlin (Die hard and Cliffhanger).

3838621,3,B0021L8UHQ,"In his film debut, The Marine (2005), John Cena played a character trying to save his abducted wife from danger.  A similar theme is the driving force in his second film, 12 Rounds (2009), where Cena is a cop trying to keep his girlfriend alive, by completing a series of harrowing tasks.  Set in New Orleans, and directed by noted action specialist Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), the film features some solidly executed action sequences, tied together fairly well, by an elaborate storyline.

At a routine traffic stop, officer Danny Fisher (Cena) and his partner Hank Carver (Brian J. White) cross paths with Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen), a big time jewel thief, and murderer, and his girlfriend Erica (Taylor Cole).  Fisher runs down Jackson, and makes an arrest, but in the process, Erica is hit by a truck and killed.

Approaching the one year anniversary of Erica's death, Jackson abducts Fisher's girlfriend Molly (Ashley Scott), and blows up the house she shares with Fisher.  In order to save her life, Danny must complete twelve rounds of challenging tasks.  Taking place within a single day, the tasks build up in intensity.  In one round, Fisher drives a fire engine through heavy traffic, crushing anything in the way.  But Fisher does not always succeed, as in another round, a man falls to his death, before Fisher can pull him off the top of an elevator car.  Also actively involved in the pursuit of Jackson, are FBI special agents George Aiken (Steve Harris) and Ray Santiago (Gonzalo Menendez), who have been tracking him for some time.

The game appears to be nearing a tragic conclusion, when a lead that Carver was following, causes Fisher to reexamine the day's events.  Like a magician, Jackson has been using misdirection, while setting in place the pieces of a grand scheme, where Molly's skills as a pilot, will play a key part.  These events unfold very quickly, and feel somewhat rushed.  The final action sequence involving a helicopter, features Cena's only real fight scene, and with a dizzying number of quick cuts, it does not play that well.  After being a prisoner for most of the movie, when given a chance to shine, Molly doesn't exactly impress with her flying skills.  The ending lacks realism, and puts a goofy topping on what was a film with a generally serious tone.

Although there are certainly weak points, the storyline has some clever aspects, that with a little more polish, and better pacing, could have resulted in a much stronger film.  Rushing things at the end, and not giving the audience a chance to appreciate what Miles Jackson was trying to do, seems like a wasted opportunity.

Some may feel that John Cena should stick with wrestling, but the man definitely has a future in films.  His screen presence stronger, and his acting is much improved, and working with Renny Harlin, was a big step up.  If Cena can land a role with more variety, it might be interesting to see what he can do.  A commentary track by Harlin, and a second with writer Daniel Kunka and Cena, provide an abundance of information about the production of the film, and such things as Cena's favorite beer, and fear of heights.

3838655,2,B0021L8UHQ,"""12 Rounds"" is the latest unsuccessful attempt to transform a professional wrestler into an action hero superstar.  In this case, it's WWE's John Cena who portrays Danny Fisher, a conscientious New Orleans detective who helps to bring a terrorist named Miles Jackson, (well played by Aiden Gillen of ""The Wire"" fame), to justice.  The problem is that Jackson holds Danny responsible for the accidental death of his girlfriend at the time of the arrest.  A year later, Jackson has masterminded a daring escape from prison and is now back to exact his revenge on Danny.  This he does by kidnapping Danny`s girlfriend, then having Danny race around town from one booby-trapped clue to another - 12 in all - in an attempt to rescue her.

It`s safe to say that ""12 Rounds"" features one of the most preposterously elaborate and least plausible cat-and-mouse scenarios to have come our way in quite some time.  Add to that a combination of flat dialogue, wooden acting (especially by Cena), and three of the most laughable actions scenes - one involving a racing fire engine, one involving a runaway cable car, and one involving an out-of-control helicopter - in recent memory, and you have a movie well worth taking a pass on.

1 Disc Extreme Cut Rated & Unrated Widescreen Edition (2009)

12 Rounds directed by Renny Harlin, the same guy who directed Die Hard 2, is the story of how Detective Danny Fisher inadvertently set events into motion that resulted in the death of a criminal, Miles Jackson's girlfriend and the game of revenge Jackson enacts on him a year later by kidnapping Fisher's girlfriend, Molly. Fisher has to complete impossible action & explosion filled missions in a series of ""rounds"" to win his woman back.

This movie had a few good ideas in its conception, after all, it sounds like Die Hard 3, right? We all remember the story of the bad guy asking Bruce Willis to complete all these riddles and tasks by certain time frames running all over town as a diversion for him stealing a bunch of money, right? Complete with a team of people willing to help you and a team of people willing to feed the action hero to the wolves? Well, this movie is the same thing, but without the jokes or fun. Don't get me wrong, destruction in an action movie is always fun, but without some smart quip at the end of it, I felt like something was missing. For one, it takes the characters until almost the end of the movie to put two and two together about Davis's real objective. It takes itself far too seriously!

John Cena as Detective Fisher has the physical role down with appearance and looks fully able to perform all the stunts and be the maverick tearing down the street and top speed or boosting himself out of an elevator about to fall or jumping from a building. The parts that are more difficult are the quiet moments where he is interacting with people one on one. The director made a choice to show flashes of him thinking about Molly being tied up from time to time, but instead of motivating our hero and spurring him on to do better, work faster, bring her home!.......he gets more hopeless and weary and looks like he's about to give up. Heroes don't give up! She's your woman, it doesn't matter what the odds are, it's not over till the fat lady sings buddy. That's the heart of the action movie and why we love to watch them. Watching this movie, I thought of Peter Pan and wondered if I was supposed to start clapping to show John Cena that yes, I do believe in fairies to give him the proper kick in the butt to get moving.

CenaI have to say that in the beginning of the movie and the end of the movie, he was given a couple funny lines to say and he delivered them well enough to get me to laugh out loud. I am a WWE fan (more rare for girls I know) and I think he is a very charismatic guy, unfortunately an unsure actor. I think if this had been more of a Bruce Willis type of movie with more comedy laced in instead of being such a downer in between explosions, he could have carried it off a bit better. He seemed capable of delivering a funnier role given the chance.

I had some problems with Aidan Gillen who played Miles Jackson. For an actual Irishman, his accent was so all over the place I had difficulty believing his heritage. Once in a great while he'd throw in a heavy ""Danny-boy"" but then have no accent whatsoever or having it sound southern! Now I know some people with accents don't have them consistently, but they kept going on and on about him being Irish so I thought a through-line there would have been better. Screw Miles Jackson. What we really needed was some Samuel L. Jackson. That is a man who knows how to yell and be a crazy villain. ""They called me Mr. Glass.....""

This movie is worth one watching. Watch the action. Try to forgive Cena. They needed a better script and to LIGHTEN UP!

DVD Extras:

There is commentary featuring John Cena and the writer, Daniel Kunka. You'll hear rousing stories of how there came to be a pug named Shorty in this movie and Cena's fear of heights. From the commentary, you really get the impression that Cena's a nice guy and really just wants to do his best and he probably knows deep down that he isn't much of an actor yet but wants to improve. In one scene the writer even remarked, ""Hey, you do some real acting here!"" Yikes, shouldn't that happen in every scene?  There is also a commentary with the director, Renny Harlin.

There is a stunts featurette that covers Cena learning to drive as a stunt driver and his love of cards and really goes into detail of his fear of heights which really humanizes him I think. There are two alternate endings with commentaries. The alternate endings have very minor differences in dialogue. The gag reel isn't bloopers so much as vodka, push-ups, and fun on the set.",1267401600,3,4605,4.388042203985932
3838660,5,B0021L8UHQ,"The last time I watched a WWE movie starring John Cena... let's just say, I love my action hot and heavy and ended up VERY satisfied, haha.

So it's absolutely NO surprise to me that 12 Rounds is a classic.

So many things to admire about a movie like this... of course you can't take the good without the bad. The first 15 minutes were some of the most predictable and generic cheesiness I have ever seen in my life.

I was almost ready to turn the movie off after those horrible 15 minutes, but then... John Cena began the chase, and when the storyline finally kicked in, this movie completely blew me away.

Everything from car crashes to explosions to shootings... 12 Rounds does it all.

I can't imagine how difficult it was to film something like this. I can't imagine how much money it cost to waste all those vehicles! Actually the same thought comes to mind with ANY action movie. It must cost a fortune.

John Cena proves why he was chosen for this role- his acting skills are almost as good as his performance in the ring. He truly has a career as a movie star when his wrestling career is over.

The storyline is about John Cena's character accidentally killing a woman. To make a long story short, he goes to arrest a bad man, the wife/girlfriend of this man happens to be hit by a car right in front of them, so the guy takes it personally and, one year later when he mysteriously gets out of jail, he decides to take his revenge against Cena.

His revenge happens to be a carefully orchestrated and elaborate set of rounds that Cena MUST follow, or else his wife dies.

This movie is highly recommended for those who love movies such as Speed. GREAT edge of your seat action.",1264809600,12,1690,4.373801916932908
3838661,2,B0021L8UHQ,"""12 Rounds"" starring John Cena is a blatent copy of ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"". The terrorist in ""12 Rounds"" said that the hotel man Willie was at the ""wrong place at the wrong time"" (a reference to the DIE HARD series). I recommend that action fans watch Die Hard 3 instead of this because Bruce Willis' acting skills are 100 times better than John Cena.

The only difference between Die Hard 3 & ""12 Rounds"" is that in 12 Rounds, The hero kills the terrorist's girlfriend (in Die Hard 3 - the hero killed the terrorist's brother).

John McClane's wife/x-wife is named Holly

John Cena's girlfriend/wife is named Molly

coincidence?

Also, if you have seen Die Hard 4, when the FBI agent tells Bowman ""It's above your pay grade"" ... In ""12 Rounds"" (in the hotel lobby) the black FBI agent tells the other one ""don't be a hero; it's not in your pay grade"".

The climax or finale of ""12 Rounds"" is a combination of bites from DIE HARD & DIE HARD 3. Think about it ...

Danny Fisher - ""It's not about revenge, it's about money"" which is the same thing that Hans' brother Simon does. He distracts everyone into thinking that he wants revenge, when in reality he has planned a major heist to steal gold.

In ""12 Rounds"" - after the trolly crashes, they turn the power off in the area - which allows the terrorist to attempt his robbery (DIE HARD 1).

2 stars for ""12 Rounds"" a.k.a. Die Hard 3 remake.

3838695,3,B0021L8UHQ,"Finished watching ""12 Rounds"" a Fox Atomic/WWE Studios production. It's a simple minded, bare bones action flick starring current WWE superstar John Cena as Detective Danny Fisher, who in the beginning of the film is pursuing a brutal terroist with a constant slipping Canadian accent named Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen). In the first 20 mins of the film Fisher pursues Jackson and Jackson's girlfirend (his incredibly hot girlfriend I might add) gets killed in an accident that he blames Fisher for.

One year later Fisher has a good life with his girlfriend Molly (Ashley Scott, T.V.'s Birds of Prey, ""Walking Tall"") but all that changes when Jackson kidnaps Molly and forces him to play a game called 12 Rounds (gasp just like the title) where he must complete each task Jackson puts in front of him within the time limit (Die Hard with a Vengeance anyone?). If Fisher wins he gets Molly back but if he loses then she dies.

The movie becomes one action sequence after another each one more elaborate and more ridiculous than the other. Like having to speed through a crowded New Orleans in a fire truck within 7 mins to disarm a bomb or stopping a streetcar with no brakes.

The writing is basic and of course atrocious, and the acting is well about what you expect from a no nonsense action flick. The action is fast and furious, and at times fun, but it feels all too familiar.

12 Rounds is a step above Cena's first film ""The Marine"" but that still only makes it a passable film at best and the conclusion of the movie is so silly as they try to tie everything together for a predictable explaination. 2 out of 4 stars.",1253664000,4,1626,4.577319587628866

3838701,4,B0021L8UHQ,"In his earlier movie, John Cena was The Marine, which was not very well received. In 12 Rounds, he stars as Detective Danny Fischer of New Orleans Police Department. This movie is definitely a step up from The Marine as Cena has developed his acting and action skills further. The story is interesting and the action sequences are spectacular but one gets the feeling of having seen it all somewhere before. The bus bomb sequence is ripped from Speed - the bus number here is 5050, in Speed it is 2525. The blowing up of Cena's partner is another scene that takes me back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Blu-ray/dp/B000ICLRHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed [Blu-ray</a>]. The streetcar sequence is somewhat similar to the train sequence in Spider-Man 2, but the action is more `human' than superhuman, so to speak. Others remind me of the various Die Hard movies.
Nevertheless, the director and the writers deserve credit for integrating all these sequences into a seamless whole so that it does not feel contrived or even impossible (we know it is). Aiden Gillen is superb as the villain of the piece, terrorist Miles Jackson. For once, the hero in this movie does not try to do everything on his own - he reluctantly agrees to FBI cooperation.
It is also great to see New Orleans being used as a locale for an action film. We are quite used to seeing L.A., New York and Chicago as a backdrop for action movies, but this was a revelation. The city looks stunning on blu-ray and even the many night scenes are well done. The film makers have gone to great lengths to use authentic settings, though I do not know the extent to which they used FX and CGI. The ending of the film was never in doubt, but it was a fitting finale. I have not yet seen the alternative endings, though.  One word about the Digital Copy - it suffers from too many artifacts in some fast moving scenes, but the overall presentation is good.
Cena's acting career is just starting to take off and this is a much better outing than The Marine. The future can only be brighter. This film can heartily be recommended for all action lovers.",1250812800,9,2162,4.811827956989247
3838702,1,B0021L8UHQ,"It is the newest thing for hollywood directors to give you the moving camera action shot.  To my knowledge the new James Bond Series does it most...and best.  However there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed..sadly 12 rounds is one of them.  The moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action, or an actual by stander to it..and does work sometimes.  The problem with 12 rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film.  This film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie.  Instead of feeling like you are at the scene of the action, the busy camera is distracting and diminishes from what might have been a better film in the hands of a more competent director....and Mr. Cena..doesn't help..he's not the greatest lead...and needs better support in front of and behind the camera if he is going to shine.",1249948800,4,961,4.526011560693641

I'm not sure if it was a matter of contract, wishful thinking by Lion's Gate, or blind insistence on Vince McMahon's part to turn his number one superstar into an action hero, but the latter of those two aforementioned fates have come to pass, and the resulting blockbuster is indeed better than ""The Marine""...but let's face it: that's not saying much at all. Cena's sophomore outing makes some minor adjustments to the fail-sure formula that caused his first film to flop as dramatically as it did, but only time will tell whether this one is headed for the same fate.

The story: Hank Carver (Cena) is a New Orleans police officer whose efforts resulted in the capture of international terrorist and mastermind Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire/dp/B001FA1P1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire</a>), as well as the death of Jackson's girlfriend. One year following his initiation of hero status, Carver finds himself thrown into a deadly game of the newly-escaped Jackson, who's captured Carver's girlfriend (Ashley Scott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jericho/dp/B001715A92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jericho</a>) to make sure the policeman will be forced to play the twelve ""rounds"" of his maniacal scheme to terrorize both him and the entire city.

I should point out that while ""The Marine"" was directed by a first-timer with no history in Hollywood at all, ""12 Rounds"" was wrangled by Renny Harlin, who knows a thing or two about action considering his work on films like Bruce Willis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard-2-Die-Harder/dp/B000O77SRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard 2 - Die Harder</a>&nbsp;and Stallone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cliffhanger/dp/0800177355/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cliffhanger</a>. With that said, you'd still be hard-pressed to considered this an action spectacle: there are meager shootouts, next to no hand-to-hand fights, and only a couple of chase scenes to further the story along. The film's advertising campaign made a big deal about the film's stuntwork, but with due respect towards the stuntmen, I saw nothing that would put anybody else to shame (least of all Jackie Chan, whom the advertisers were comparing Cena to). There is one definitively cool scene in which Cena surfs a runaway streetcar, but overall, the film relies more on the action ""feeling"" than actual action.

On the bright side, the film's acting content eclipses that of pretty much any movie that the WWE has produced. Nobody's about to win any awards, but as far as action films go, Cena, Gillen, and Scott are on the upper cusp, along with Brian J. White (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-O-A-Dead-or-Alive/dp/B000I0RNXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D.O.A. - Dead or Alive</a>) as Carver's partner and buddy and Steve Harris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001MVYUR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>) as a Special Forces agent determined to take down Miles Jackson at any cost. Also, gone are the vain attempts at pop humor introduced in ""The Marine"" - ""12 Rounds"" tries hard to be fun, but doesn't really bother itself with trying to make you laugh. What is does try to be, however, is smart, but since these instances of the antagonist's brilliance are limited to short little bursts and are frequently pepper with illogic, it's largely a moot point.

Cena's character is pretty much given free rein to destroy the city at will (with cars, bombs, and public transportation) on his mission to save his wife, and he does so to the point that his demolition spree is easily the most fun part of the movie. However, in a world populated by increasingly creative actioneers, this ""Die Hard"" ripoff looks appallingly toothless and isn't about to stand up to fellow action debutees like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Origins-Wolverine/dp/B001GCUO1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a>&nbsp;or ""G.I. Joe"". Nevertheless, while ""The Marine"" was positively unarmed when it came out, at least ""12 Rounds"" is packing some form of heat...even if it's only a peashooter. When an action film can't even fulfill the necessities of its genre, no amount of frills can save it from a step beyond obscurity, and this is the case for the film that doomed FOX's Atomic department.",1249603200,,5030,6.2020057306590255

My personal experience while (small and brief) was not like that, and I have always understood that it is crazy hard to even be accepted by the academy, but who knows. It just seems like TV and movie directors seem to have some axe to grind with the FBI and this film continued the trend.

John Cena is an entertaining fella regardless of what some would have you believe and is a very charismatic guy. In the ring on the mic or in a movie he is an appealing enough guy [especially for the ladies I guess because my girl is into him] to keep most people entertained. Now I will be the first guy to tell you that is not going to win any Oscars for his acting [yet] and neither will this film since it is pretty much a rip off of ""Die Hard 3"" but it is interesting none the less. Is it better than his last film ""The Marine"" you may ask, well in some ways yes and in others no. To be honest I think ""The Marine"" is more fun as it is over the top kinda in a cartoonish kinda way, but this one is good as well.

Danny Fisher is just your average street cop trying to make detective as is his partner Hank Carver and on one fateful night the just might get their wish. But to do that they must find Miles Jackson a bad guy on the FBI's most wanted list and he was spotted in the area. Cena, I mean Danny has a good eye because he notices Miles's girlfriend driving, off a hunch or feeling he and his partner pull her over only to be under gun fire from Miles once the car has stopped. I guess it was a good guess or just a good eye but they caught on to these two on the run.

After a short chase on foot Danny catches up to them only to witness the woman get killed after trying to escape and getting hit by a car. This is actually one of my favorite scenes in the film but at this point Miles sets in with his revenge kick as he wants to know his name. Fast forward a couple of years and Miles has escaped and not only that but when Danny is out one day he gets a call, from Miles. He has Danny's wife and wants Danny to play a little game with him, a city wide game lasting over 12 rounds if Danny can make it that long. So the race is on to save his wife and catch this guy one more time.

This is an obvious rip off of Die Hard 3 but it is a fun one to be honest and is just meant to be straight up action. This film has plenty of that from fights to shoot outs to explosions to fast cars, you get it all on this Renny Harlin helmed film. One part in particular is very entertaining and it involves a tram, a car, a little carnival, and two very brave men in that one car. I won't ruin it but it is one of the highlights of the film. Still there is plenty of action else were like a nice fire truck scene and plenty of things going boom.

As for the games he has to play they are interesting as well such as the one involving the elevator, which is a favorite of mine. But every one time up in the end much like another movie like this one did, can you guess what it is? Director Renny Harlin who directed the second film in the Die Hard series does a good job with the action and stuff but only decent with every thing else. Daniel Kunka did a good enough job with his first script but it is basically well you know what film it is, not entirely but the idea is basically the same.

John Cena as usual is a charismatic guy and has good screen presence but he is never given enough to work with other than the action. Like I have said before Cena has the potential to be a really good actor, maybe not as good as The Rock but definitely better than Hogan [every body is though really]. Aidan Gillen steals the show as the lead villain and is basically the best thing about the film on every level, he needs more villain roles. Every one in the film does a good job but this movie is not about the acting it is about the action. If that is what you are looking for than this film is for you.

Not sure which of his films I like better because both out do one another in some way, I don't know that is your call. This is a good enough film for a rental at the very least and would be wonderful for a Saturday afternoon or something. So sit back and enjoy if this is your thing, I liked it.",1247616000,2,3908,3.889724310776942
3838740,3,B0021L8UHQ,"If nothing else one has to give credit to the WWE for attempting to spread out further than the squared circle. While their attempt at a new football franchise failed, their diving into the world of film has done well for them. Some movies hit highs and some drop to lows but they're almost always entertaining. They also provide a jumping board for the careers of their wrestlers. Such is the case with John Cena.

Cena has starred in one film already, the well received THE MARINE. An action film seemed a natural leap for him and he did a fine job handling acting and action chores both with ease. The next step was finding a follow up vehicle and that came about with the new release 12 ROUNDS.

Cena stars as New Orleans policeman Danny Fisher who winds up by circumstance in the middle of an FBI hunt to track down a terrorist named Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen). A chase follows and after he stops the terrorist, Jackson tells his girlfriend to run before he takes the time to notice an oncoming truck in her path. Blaming Fisher for her death, he swears they'll meet again.

Fast forward one year later and Danny is now a detective. He heads to work only to get a phone call. It's Jackson and he informs Danny that he's taken Danny's girlfriend Molly (Ashley Scott) hostage. Just to let him know he's serious, Jackson blows up Danny and Molly's house while Danny watches. He then tells him they're going to play a game with the life of Molly hanging in the balance. All Danny has to do is win the majority of the 12 rounds Jackson has planned for him.

Danny contacts his partner on the force for assistance and then heads out to take on the first round. Each one sets him up for a life or death situation for either himself or some innocent person who finds themselves involved in helping him. While he rejoices at the wins, he begins to feel guilty over the losses as they involve the death or injury of someone else.

Along the way the FBI become involved since they've been watching all along. Of course Danny's not to keen to work with them since they failed to notify him earlier of the prison break involving Jackson. Unlikely allies begin to work together to try and take down this mad man while saving Molly at the same time.

Steve Harris stars as Special Agent George Aiken, the main agent in charge of catching Jackson from the start. His concerns focus more on the recapture than on saving Molly. Of course this results in head to head conflict with Danny and his goal of saving the woman he loves. Agent Aiken has a personal reason for wanting Jackson caught as well but eventually realizes he may have put his personal interests above the life of this woman.

The clock is ticking and with only so many hours allotted for Danny to complete all of his tasks, he struggles to find a way to beat Jackson at his own game. Beaten down, battered along the way, the final showdown approaches. Only then will we discover who wins and who loses the game of 12 rounds.

Cena does a fine job here with only one problem. He's never given much chance to act. Perhaps that's the intention, giving him just enough moments to convince people of his sincerity but for the most part just jumping, running and fighting to reach the films conclusion. Cena can do a decent job of acting but unless he's given the opportunity, his chances of a long term career in film dwindles.

While the film does offer the requisite amount of action with minimal amount of plot, the twists and turns Jackson puts Danny through are original for the most part. But as I was watching this film I kept thinking I'd seen it before. It was only after I was reminded by a friend that I put it all together and realized that Bruce Willis was pretty much put through the paces of games that kept him running in DIE HARD 3. While this film is not an exact copy, the overall feeling creeps in at times.

That being said, it remains a fine piece of entertainment. The production values are well done and all the money spent to make the picture shows on the screen. Rarely has New Orleans looked this good and with the bad press of Katrina, it's nice to see the locale used once again.

All in all you won't do wrong by renting this film to watch. And for Cena fans, you'll want to add it to your collection. But let's hope that he gets the chance to stretch himself a little further in his next film. Only then can he hope to achieve greater stardom rather than find himself in the straight to DVD category.",1247356800,30,4482,4.400966183574879
3838741,5,B0021L8UHQ,"John Cena's follow-up to ""The Marine"" is another great action vehicle for him. This time,he's a New Orleans detective trying to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend from the clutches of a vengeful escaped convict out to avenge his lover's death,which happened when the detcetive arrested him a year earlier. The story may be nonsense,but thanks to writer Daniel Kunka and director Renny Harlin,it works. Kunka loads the script with sharp dialogue,solid charcaters,and humor,while Harlin keeps the whole thing moving at a fast pace and whips up a lot of suspense. They are well-backed by strong work from a top crew,and good performances from a great cast.
Ashley Scott is appealing as the girlfriend,while Aidan Quillen nearly steals the film as its bad guy. But this is John Cena's film all the way

3838742,2,B0021L8UHQ,"John Cena does his share of ridiculous stunts in this one, but nothing as ludicrous as the I'm an invincible, tear down a building with my forehead, bulletproof machine that he did in THE MARINE. Not to mention, with all the acting experience he has from wrestling, you'd think he'd be able to muster up some kind of emotion as his wife is being used as a doggie treat, dangled in front of him throughout 12 ROUNDS.

Ultimately though, 12 ROUNDS isn't all that bad. It has lots of twists and some good action scenes. It's certainly never boring, just frequently bad, for all sorts of reasons.

The main thing that put me off from the beginning is that really, all it is, is a combination of DIE HARD WITH A VENGENCE (the simon says one) and THE MARINE (cause he has to chase after his wife again).

There are actually some pretty cool puzzles to figure out as the escaped convict Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen), returns to revenge the death of his girlfriend. The problem is, there was too much of it and he figures them out way too fast.

I don't care that he's John Cena and doesn't look like your typical brainiac, but he walks into an art gallery and in less than a minute figures out that a certain painting has the next clue on it. Have some fun with it! The audience wants to play along. Have some tact. When the director and writer don't include you in the fun, it's just like watching a commercial. ""Oh, that was neat. Hey! Is this a new Maxim?""

3838754,4,B0021L8UHQ,"The World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) returns with another action-packed film starring one of their more popular wrestlers, John Cena.

The film is directed by Renny Harlin (""Cliffhanger"", ""Deep Blue Sea"", ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" and ""Cleaner""), a screenplay by Daniel Kunka, music composed by Trevor Rabin (""Race to Witch Mountain"", ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" and ""Get Smart"") and cinematography by David Boyd (Director of Photography for television series ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Without A Trace"" and ""Firefly"").

The film would star John Cena (""The Marine"") as Det. Danny Fisher; Aidan Gillen (""The Wire"", ""Shanghai Knights"" and ""Blackout"") as the main antagonist Miles Jackson, Ashley Scott (""Walking Tall"", ""Into the Blue"" and ""The Kingdom"") as Danny's girlfriend, Molly Porter; Steve Harris (""Quarantine"", ""Minority Report"" and ""The Practice"") as Special Agent George Aiken; Brian White (""The Shield"") as Danny's partner Det. Hank Carver and Gonzalo Mendez (""Cane"" and ""Fracture"") as Special Agent Ray Santiago.

""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" comes with both the original theatrical version and the extreme cut (an extra minute).  The Blu-ray release includes a second disc which is a digital copy of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

I have to say that Twentieth Century Fox has been doing an excellent job with many of their new releases on Blu-ray.  ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 2:35:1), AVC@26MBPS and delivers amazing picture quality.  The detail of the film, may it be night or day time scenes are just fantastic.

The film is just filled with action sequences, explosions and every detail from the explosions to the skin pores on the face of John Cena can be seen clearly via High Definition.  The colors are vibrant and overall, flesh tones and blacks are solid.  You can see the detail throughout the film and overall, ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" delivers in picture quality.

As for audio, the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack is amazing.  For an action film that is going to have tons of explosions, automobile crashes and such, I expected nothing less than spectacular.  I literally felt the audio coming from all around and great use of directional panning of rear surrounds, the musical score from Trevor Rabin shining through the front speakers, audio coming clearly through the center channel and LFE utilizing the booms of the explosions and utilizing your subwoofer.  Again, ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" delivers in the audio department.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in Spanish, Cantonese, Korean, Mandarin and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" comes with the following special features:

  * Audio Commentary by Director Renny Harlin - The more technical commentary as Director Renny Harlin sets up a scene and talks about the shots he wanted to get.  Harlin also talks about working with the talent and filming in Louisiana post-Katrina.  A really informative commentary.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that I was impressed by the level of action in this film.  Typically, I expect action from a WWE-related film and often at times, the films have been more action than storyline based and performance by the WEE talent tends to be average or less than average.

""12 Rounds"" is a film with mindless action and John Cena shows that he can be just as big of an action star as former WWE star, Dwayne (formerly ""The Rock) Johnson.

For the most part, the film was enjoyable because there is so much action and there is a coherent storyline involved. The game of ""12 rounds"" between the protagonist Det. Danny Fisher and the terrorist Miles Jackson was quite interesting, especially learning the true reason of why the ""12 rounds"" was being played at the end.

I did feel it was quite a stretch when we see the character Molly Porter (Ashley Scott) piloting a helicopter and I definitely didn't see that one coming.  And acting performances from the other talents were average at best.  But it's already a given, WWE-related films are not films to watch for Academy Award level performances, it's about the action and what the WWE superstar can deliver.

And seeing so many bad action films starring WWE superstars, ""12 Rounds"" is definitely one of those rare gems that I felt delivered in terms of action and enjoyability.

I really was entertained and it helps that Twentieth Century Fox delivered with its High Definition transfer and showcased awesome picture and audio quality because it definitely made this film much more enjoyable.  If you are going to have that many explosions and automobile destruction, I want to hear that lossless soundtrack to be magnificent.  And I'm confident to say that WWE fans and fans of mindless action-based films will truly enjoy the HD transfer of ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"".

Overall, if you are looking for an enjoyable action film this Summer on Blu-ray, ""12 Rounds - Extreme Cut"" is definitely worth checking out!",1246665600,2,7615,4.978622327790974

  The director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2, Deep Blue Sea) certainly does a better job with action movies than the bad directors who were hired to do big summer movies this year. But this movie doesn't give us much of anything new. It is Speed meets Die Hard with a Vengeance, meets Blown Away.

My ultimate conclusion is that this is a great film. It's not perfect. Then again no action film ever truly is.

It takes the related plot of Die Hard 3, of a villain using games to seek revenge, and EXPANDS on it. The action was constant. It was intense.  John Cena deserves much praise, one that I HOPE most movie goers (and WWE fans) come around to. :)",1246320000,2,681,4.143939393939394
3838760,4,B0021L8UHQ,"A great deal of hate out there about his film, but once again the Blu product outshines the film and provides for an adequate package whether you rent it or purchase it. Our story of John Cena playing a superhuman cop in New Orleans is just that - cut and dry. I have read 10-15 paragraph reviews here about the plot, but I feel one sentence takes care of it - you know what to expect. Now for the fun stuff.

The picture quality was outstanding at times, average in others, but with the amount of CGI clean-up, action, explosions, and camera jitters I feel the only way to sufficiently see the details is in high definition. The sound is what makes this though. They mixed the bass heavily to the front channels, so even when I tested the DTS without the sub on - it still sounded excellent. I would almost have to say it is an excellent test for your subwoofer over the other films this year. I could not find any real faults in the DTS throughout, so finally a great mix on a no-brainer action film.

The special features are what give this 2.5 star film a 4.5 though. Yes, some (at times most) of the material is very egocentric and all about Cena - but I figure one would not be watching this otherwise. I will try to separate them in case one does not have the hours to invest in surfing through all that is offered here.

Cena-centric:
* The commentary on the unrated version with Cena and the writer (Kunka) is almost comical with how it is all about John, and nowhere near as informative unless you want to hear John talk about John.
* The Viral Videos, Hands and Helicopter; short spoofs where John tries to partake in comedic skits that are truly painful to watch.
* Round and Round; played on TV and other WWE products about John and Harlin mock interviewing each other.
* Crash Course (stunts); probably the most worthwhile featurette of this batch that contains the story behind the driving stunts and how awesome John's abilities are, with some bits on his personal collection of cool cars.
* Cena Gag-reel; John hamming it up on set.

Regular Featurettes:
* 12 Rounds; probably the one to watch if you want the overall feel of production logistics, interviews and such. Totals 20 minutes and grabs footage and various stuff from all of the other material.
* Streetcar crossing; my favorite. Had everything about the work it took to make the streetcar scene happen, filled with plenty of kudos to the New Orleans PD and everyone else who made a very difficult sequence happen in the busiest part of the city.
* Keeping score; for a select few that like the music info for action films.

The alternate endings were thankfully cut out (both total less than a minute and add/subtract a line or character). The unrated cut is only 2:45 minutes longer and had no earth-shattering differences.

Overall, a worthy package for his fans to buy and maybe a rental for those wanting to test their sound system, hope you enjoy.",1245974400,7,2930,4.508474576271187
3838761,5,B0021L8UHQ,"I thought 12 Rounds was a fantastic movie. It's so much better then John's first theatrical outing, The Marine. And I'm not being mean when I say that, because I liked The Marine. It's just that 12 Rounds is infinitely better.

Now, I'm a huge John Cena fan. I'm what you could call a ""fangirl."" But don't let that dissuade you from reading my review or taking it seriously, I'm looking at this movie as a movie, not just because John is in it.

First off, let's look at the storyline. If you've read the other reviews, you'll know the plot. Here, the 'girlfriend gets kidnapped' story arc is much better then in The Marine - in that movie John's character was just aimlessly running around looking for her, in 12 Rounds, Danny has to follow clues and solve problems to get Molly back. The clues are well thought out and interesting, and the problems Danny gets into are exciting and thrilling.

Next, the characters. The characters in 12 Rounds are much better rounded (no pun intended) then in The Marine. The villain is an evil character who just wants revenge - instead of just kidnapping Molly and demanding ransom, he kidnaps her and makes Danny play his twisted games. I like Miles Jackson as the villain, he's smart and evil, without being too over the top. John's character Danny is also a lot better this time around, he has more of a past. He's a policeman, and lives with his girlfriend Molly and their dog Shorty. Molly doesn't get much screentime, but she's not a damsel in distress - she tries to outwit Miles in scenes, and helps Danny if she can. The other secondary characters such as Danny's friend, and the FBI agents who help Danny follow Miles are also likeable.

The stunts are also amazing - I especially like the part where Danny has to stop an out of control tram. I also like the bit where Danny has to get out of a building by rapelling down the side - that scene was hard for John to film as he's scared of heights, but you wouldn't think so watching it. The explosions aren't over the top, and everything is believable.

12 Rounds is an enjoyable time, and I saw it the day it opened in NZ. I think lots of different people could enjoy this movie, as it has nothing to do with wrestling outside of John. Anybody who likes action movies with lots of cool stunts would like it. A big drawing point is the 12 rounds game that Miles makes Danny play, that would interest a lot of people as it's an unique plot point.

Overall, I do recommend this movie, and it's one of the best movies I've seen in 2009 to date (the other is The Wrestler). A definite 5 stars, and I can't wait for the DVD to be released!",1245024000,8,2631,4.370143149284254
3838762,3,B0021L8UHQ,"Does World Wrestling Entertainment have any business producing a cop thriller? They have already tried their hand at horror with 2006's ""See No Evil,"" and we all know how that turned out. On the basis of that and their newest film, ""12 Rounds,"" maybe they should leave movies alone and just stick to what they know best (then again, pro wrestling is about as staged as anything done by a movie studio). Had they not been involved, I think it's safe to say that John Cena wouldn't have been cast, that director Renny Harlin would have been allowed to audition actors capable of projecting credibility. It would be too harsh to say that Cena's performance was bad, but he definitely didn't convince me that he was a cop, or even that he was trying to be a cop. He only convinced me that a pro wrestler was cast to play a cop in a movie. It could be worse, I suppose--at least he didn't turn to the camera and shout, ""The champ is here!""

Of course, some of the blame has to go to Harlin, who seems more invested in clever camera angles and action sequences than in story. Some of the visuals are decent enough, but the very concept is implausible from the word go, and it only gets more implausible with every scene. Taking place in New Orleans, the story begins in 2007, when a wanted Irish weapons dealer named Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen) is finally caught. His girlfriend is killed that same night, and he blames Officer Danny Fisher (Cena), who responded to the call for backup. As he's being handcuffed, Jackson vows revenge, saying to Fisher, ""I'll remember you.""

Flash forward one year. Fisher has been promoted to the rank of Detective, and he's in a committed relationship with his girlfriend, Molly (Ashley Scott). Through a series of unlikely events, Jackson escapes from prison and returns to New Orleans on the anniversary of his girlfriend's death. He then kidnaps Molly and forces Fisher to participate in a game consisting of twelve rounds, each designed to be physically and ethically challenging. Each round brings Fisher to a new location in the city, where a strategically placed clue has been left behind. I won't get into a detailed description of every challenge; needless to say, they get more and more elaborate in their plotting and execution, which means they get less and less plausible with every passing scene. If Fisher manages to pass all twelve rounds, Molly will be set free.

Fisher and Jackson keep in touch via constant cell phone calls, and somehow or another, Jackson is always able to cover his tracks. This is especially frustrating to George Aiken (Steve Harris), a special agent for the FBI; for personal reasons, he too is after Jackson, and no one, not even a cop like Danny Fisher, is going to stop him. This subplot might have worked had the tension between New Orleans police and the FBI not been so forced and predictable. Aiken is the proverbial Man on a Mission, and to hell with Fisher and his kidnapped girlfriend. Of course, there inevitably comes a point at which everything depends solely on Fisher, which is to say that even the driven George Aiken will have to step aside and let things happen the way they're supposed to happen.

While not a wholly engaging or even original story, it still seems interesting enough on first glance. But as the film progresses, it quickly becomes clear that the filmmakers are grabbing at straws, desperate to make some kind of connection with the audience. By the end, I got the sense that nothing of significance occurred, that I wasn't seeing a story unfold so much as I was watching a series of images pass before my eyes. Much like a paint-by-numbers kit, this movie is manufactured and artless, every colorful nuance predetermined and placed only where they're supposed to be placed. Not even the more exciting sections--such as when Fisher has to stop a runaway cable car from plowing through a crowd--were all that surprising or entertaining.

And then there's the dialogue, which is really nothing more than a collection of shallow one-liners and clich cop statements. Pretty much all of the latter is heard between Fisher and his partner, Detective Hank Carver (Brian White), who seems less like a developed character and more like a plot convenience.

But the real failure of ""12 Rounds"" is the involvement of World Wrestling Entertainment, who saw fit to cast a man incapable of playing a cop. John Cena may be a gifted performer in a wrestling ring, but when it comes to movies--many of which require a sense of depth and complexity--there's a lot to be desired. The same can be said for the story, which is so uninteresting that I eventually stopped caring whether or not Molly would survive her ordeal. When I searched for cast and crew information on IMDb.com, I became aware of a twenty-minute film that also goes by the title ""12 Rounds."" It tells the story of a bisexual boxer who struggles with his sexual orientation. This got me thinking: What if Renny Harlin's ""12 Rounds"" were about a bisexual cop torn between his kidnapped girlfriend and his detective partner? Or better yet, what he finds himself falling for his girlfriend's kidnapper? Now that's what I call an interesting story.",1239926400,2,5200,4.753045404208195
