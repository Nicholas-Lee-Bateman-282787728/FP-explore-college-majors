He often come across as blunt on the web, but he is a New Yorker.  Regardless, he had trained in Chinese martial arts for over two (maybe three) decades, trained with many of its best teachers, and crossed trained in bjj, judo, etc.  So, regardless how you might feel about his bluntness, he has always been informative in his writings and really know his stuffs, the art of fighting.

The san da training system dvd series is his vision of how to adapting Chinese martial arts for the modern living style.  Or how you can train in a short amount of time and still learn a useful set of combative skill.  This series of dvd is informative and highly useful for anyone who have an interest in martial arts or sport fighting.  He uses the competitive sport format of san da to teach how to fight.  He does explain his fighting strategy in terms of CMA fighting principles.  So, for those of you who have trained in CMA before, you will be familiar with these principle.  His explanation are straightforward, so even if you don't have any CMA background, you will understand what he is saying easily as well.

His methodology is ring tested, he has trained several national san da champions, muay thai champion and his students have a winning record in MMA competitions.  His gym has a resident bjj black belt trainer, so he is open to all form of combat.  He tries to develop his students so they are able to handle to threats from the skill sets of modern day fighters who have training in bjj, muay thai, etc.
