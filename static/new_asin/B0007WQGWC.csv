8052988,5,B0007WQGWC,"If you have bought the Wim Wenders collection, there is only one as of 2014. The movies listed are the firest and only volume. There is no 2!",1416009600,,141,4.071428571428571
8052989,5,B0007WQGWC,"This box set is worth it just for ""The American Friend"".  That you get most of Wenders's other films as well makes it a huge bargain.  ""The American Friend"" is easily the best film that Dennis Hopper ever starred in outside of ""Easy Rider"" (""Apocalypse Now"" supplants both but his role amounted to an extended cameo more than anything else.)  An amazing and virtually forgotten classic.",1366329600,,386,4.818181818181818
8052990,5,B0007WQGWC,"Great value for a few really great films and occasional lesser works from Wenders.  Although labelled as ""Vol. 2,"" this is really the one and only volume available.  ""Volume 1"" was an old Anchor Bay set that only included three of the films that reappear here: FRIEND, LIGHTNING, and NOTEBOOK.

So, collectors: forget about the ""Volume 2"" moniker and enjoy this Wenders set!",1243036800,20,374,4.904761904761905
8052991,5,B0007WQGWC,"A fantastic collection from a master filmmaker, comprising some of his best known as well as his less well known works.  Denis Hopper in An American Friend, the work of Ozu and his cinematographer in Tokyo Ga are particular stand outs.",1171152000,7,235,4.7317073170731705
