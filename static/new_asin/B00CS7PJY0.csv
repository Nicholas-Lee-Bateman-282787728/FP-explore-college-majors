5737548,1,B00CS7PJY0,"So disappointed with this match listing. Why have all these PPV matches? I had hoped that they would stick to mainly house shows and unreleased footage. There are a few gems on this, so maybe if it gets down to 9.99 or so I'd pick this up.

I think they missed the boat big time with this.",1376870400,6,289,4.0701754385964914
5737549,1,B00CS7PJY0,"I was looking really forward to this set when I first heard about it. Of course, I expected it to be a bunch of unreleased MSG house shows that most people outside of the NY market have never seen. Wishful thinking. That's about ten percent of this set, all pre-Hogan era stuff. The rest of the set is stuff that has been mostly released elsewhere on DVD. Not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. I got 2 words for you: DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!",1375920000,15,447,4.270588235294118
5737550,2,B00CS7PJY0,"The lack of Sammartino bouts alone kills the concept.
I agree with everyone on here about the repeat matches from previous DVD's.  Come on, WWE...
That vault is full of so much unreleased footage and we all know it.

Any MSG matches from the 60's, 70's and early 80's and even into the first 2 years of Hogan's first title run would be a goldmine.  And, there are tons of matches that never even made it to their Coliseum videos in the 80's.  Bob Backlund's title reign lasted almost 6 years and he defended the belt at MSG every month - that's almost 72 matches right there.  Don't get me started about Bruno...

To the comment about 70's matches being boring - we've been around and around about the style, etc., of old school matches and how the product was presented back then.  I understand and am not here to bash anyone for their opinion.  But remember, we didn't get star vs. star matches on Saturday morning.  You had to go to the arena for that.  And, you never saw a WWWF/WWF title defense on TV.  For new school fans like this, WWE should include at least a 60-second vignette of any confrontations or interviews from the Allen Town/Hamburg TV tapings that led to each match, giving the newer fans a little background on the stars and the feud if there was one.

Sammartino, Chief Jay Strongbow, Spiros Arion, Andre the Giant, George Steele (with the riot police leading him to the ring - the good old days!), Masked Superstar, Snuka, Superstar Graham, Backlund, Pedro Morales (all over the 70's and early 80's), Don Muraco, the Valiants, Don Leo Jonathan, Blackjack Mulligan, Big John Studd, THE GRAND WIZARD, Killer Kowalksi,the list goes on and on.

The one thing I love about watching the old school matches - as boring as they may be to some - is that rabid MSG crowd.  Even Hogan's big night against the Iron Sheik - watch the audience.  No pyro, no stage with video packages - just ""22,000 plus on their feet..."" as Gorilla Monsoon would say.  A different yet wild era, the likes of which we'll never experience again.

Can't please everyone?  Then how about for all these years, WWE include an extra disc or more easter eggs with these classic bouts.  They were doing the easter eggs for a bit around 2002-2004 on their DVD's.  But, that vault is full of unreleased footage.  And, don't forget about the Philly Spectrum, the Shea Stadium cards and the Boston Garden.  Open it already.",1375920000,28,2404,4.567757009345795
5737551,4,B00CS7PJY0,I think that this will be a classic dvd but where is Don Muraco? Why wasn't he on this dvd. He not only had great matches at the Garden but he also main evented at msg and the ic champ.,1375660800,,185,3.65
5737552,1,B00CS7PJY0,"The Best of Madison Square Garden -- when I think of the Garden I think of the dimly-lit building where the WWF's best stars fought and bled to entertain fans and build the foundation for which this great company is built; we don't need another DVD with the ladder match (I think that's on four DVDs already -- NOT INCLUDING THE WRESTLEMANIA X DVD) or Austin stunning McMahon or JOHN CENA.

Fans want the old-school stuff from the 70s and 80s and the early EARLY 90s, not stuff we've already seen (and seen and seen). I want to see the crazy main events from the house shows; not the first WrestleMania main event that's already on Hogan's DVD (and Piper's DVD and the WrestleMania DVD).

This one is going to be a tough sell for me to buy. I'm tired of seeing the same matches on the new DVDs.",1374796800,11,794,4.322147651006712
5737553,1,B00CS7PJY0,This could have been an incredible set but once again wwe chose to ignore virtually everything pre-Hogan. Only 4 matches from years prior. I cant believe how much they continually ignore us old school fans and keep shoving World Wrestling Entertainment down our throats. I will not be wasting my money on this.,1373328000,6,310,4.867924528301887
5737554,2,B00CS7PJY0,I CAN NOT BELIEVE THE MAN WHO SOLD OUT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN OVER 200 TIMES IN A ROW IS ON THIS IN ONLY 1 MATCH.SO WHY IS HE ON THE COVER.LOOK PEOPLE WANT BRUNO ! SO Y NOT MAKE A SET ALL WITH BRUNO MATCHES.WHEN I SAW MSG I REALLY EXPECTED AT LEAST 5 OR MORE BRUNO MATCHES.THAT WAS AND IS HIS HOUSE.,1373328000,7,298,3.746031746031746
5737555,1,B00CS7PJY0,WWE really just doesn't care about the fans this release could have been pure Gold a release to remember one that everybody should own but instead it's mostly matches that have been released on other DVD sets.  Give us unreleased matches and you will sell more.  I don't recommend this there are a few good old ones but it's basically double dip matches.,1373241600,10,354,4.603174603174603

I am disappointed with the match listing, while the unreleased matches are great, there is a bunch of repeats and why bother putting the Bob Backlund vs Diesel match that only lasted 5 seconds? I am going to cancel my pre-order and ask this for my birthday which is in September so I do not have to pay out of my pocket for this disappointing set",1373241600,15,3558,5.02065404475043

5737564,1,B00CS7PJY0,The best match ever( Snuka v. Morroco) wasn't included! What a rip-off. Details should be stated in the description. It would affect my opinion of a worthy buy or not.,1388707200,,167,4.6
5737565,3,B00CS7PJY0,"WWE really missed the boat on this release. This set has tons of good matches but it's matches we've seen dozens of times. MSG use to tape shows in the 80's & 90's & show them on there network & I wish they would have released some of those unseen gems rather then matches we've seen dozens of times. Another small gripe is there is no Jimmy Snuka. His leap from the cage at MSG inspiried many wrestlers like RVD & Mick Foley. For them too put Hogan-Sheik title match & ladder match from WrestleMania 10 instead of this legendary moment is mind boggling. Again, a few unseen matches but far too many matches that everyone has already seen. If they released a set called Best of MSG: Unreleased then I could forgive WWE but for lack of new material & the Jimmy Snuka snub is unforgivable.",1388620800,3,787,4.360544217687075

5737567,2,B00CS7PJY0,"Quite simply, not good enough considering the rich history WWE shares with Madison Square Garden. Unlike with the recent 50 year dvd about the History of WWE, this was the perfect showcase for rareties from WWE. Tons of footage that could have been used in this release and way too much of this has been released before. Only hope is maybe a volume 2 will come out with a better selection than this edition has.",1386028800,3,411,4.493333333333333
5737568,1,B00CS7PJY0,"The WWE has a big problem with DVD releases. It's always the same. Either cheap matches or repeats. The same old blabla !

You want something that will sell good; how about a DVD with Bruno's best matches, why not a 3 DVD set.

It's time to open the vaults if you want a bestseller.

Don't waste your time with this one. I won't even buy it.",1381881600,3,341,4.059701492537314
5737569,3,B00CS7PJY0,"There are many historical landmarks where no matter where you live, you know where that place is & what it's all about. Madison Square Garden is one of those places & it's been the ""home"" to WWE dating back decades leading to so many historical moments & memories from the building which WWE attempts to recap here. Matt Striker not only host this set as he gives us a tour a WWE acknowledgements throughout the arena such as the wall dedicated to the first WrestleMania along with hearing from others throughout the presentation such as Ivan Koloff on how Pedro Morales ""stole"" the WWE Championship, Bruno Sammartino on how MSG made him an international star, Bob Backlund on the importance of MSG, Harley Race on his debut in the building, Iron Sheik's story of the offer given to him by Verne Gagne for his WWE Title defense against Hulk Hogan, Vince McMahon on how he coined the phrase ""sports entertainment"" due to the first WrestleMania & the importance of Steve Austin giving him the stunner, Bob Eucker on meeting Andre The Giant, The Miz's memory as a child of the Ultimate Warrior, how Bret Hart felt that ""the Garden fans are the truest fans"", Howard Finkel on WrestleMania X, Kevin Nash's story of how him winning the WWE Title started by him sleeping on Vince's couch, The Rock on his debut, Mick Foley on how he didn't know about Cactus Jack's WWE debut at first, Jim Ross' memory of the tag team table match, Daniel Bryan's expectation of what he debut reaction would be & what he ended up receiving, what made Booker T so nervous on his MSG debut, how the reaction from his return almost made Triple H break character, how Big Show felt his match with John Cena was comparable to Hogan vs. Andre, Trish Status' connection not only to MSG but the New York area, John Cena on how there is only one ""Garden"", and Shawn Michaels memory of finally ""selling out"" the building. Along with the matches on this set are additional moments such as Steve Austin's first Stone Cold Stunner on Vince McMahon, Booker T's debut as part of the WCW invasion, and Triple H's return from his quad injury.

Normally I'll leave my summary for the end of my review but just based off the other heavily negative reviews alone, I'll just leave it here. WWE put themselves in a ""no-win"" situation here because it's impossible to list every single memorable moment (and even that is subjective) since that building has been WWE's ""home"" for around 50 years dating back to when Vince Sr. ran the World WIDE Wrestling Federation & moments from EACH ERA of WWE had to be included on this set to appeal to a variety of audiences with this being a ""Best Of"" set. Anyone who's read my previous reviews know I don't like a heavy amount of repeats from previous sets when there is so much material that is still unreleased that would have been a suitable replacement but this is not ""Madison Square Garden: UNRELEASED"" but a ""Best Of"" meaning some moments that have been previously released either through other sets or anthologies have to be on here because of the importance that match had on not just WWE but the industry itself which happened in that building (Shawn/Razor, first WrestleMania main event, Sheik/Hogan, Perfect/Hart). Now my personal criticisms were that there is no excuse for not having a Bruno Sammartino WWE Title defense when he sold out the building more than anyone else, seemed like WWE made it a priority to make sure members of their recent Hall Of Fame class (also held in MSG) had a match or moment included on here when they weren't of any major value past a personal memory & could have just been easily talked about or shown in highlights, and some of the matches chosen weren't of any importance to the building or classic quality to be justified here.

Matches Include:
WWE Champion Ivan Koloff vs. Pedro Morales - Jim Ross does the commentary on this match that started out with Ivan Koloff stalling in the beginning before Pedro gained the advantage showing his superior quickness causing Ivan to ground him with a chinlock & various kicks to the face keeping the momentum slow working over Pedro's back with a bear hug to the point where Pedro's back gave out on him during a second slam but Pedro kept fighting back to the point taking advantage of where he was in the ring.
Feb. '71
[History Of The WWE Championship]

WWE Champion Billy Graham vs. Bruno Sammartino - We got a classic Superstar Graham promo before the match as Bruno started out with strong strikes & kicks that kept knocking Graham out of the ring before he was able to gain an advantage using the full nelson to ware him down only for Bruno to use his power & apply the same move to Graham who had to use a different method to break the hold as they traded momentum with throat chops & strikes to the point where the brawling got so out of control that the referee ended up getting caught in the middle of the action.
June '77

Texas Death Match: WWE Champion Bob Backlund vs. Ken Patera - A rare occurrence back then as this was a ""Champion vs. Champion"" match as Patera was also the Intercontinental Champion as this match started out with some brief brawling on the floor as Patera took control working over the head with a double arm chinlock & front facelock while using his strength in a bearhug & full nelson but Backlund fought back with an impactful atomic drop that sent Patera out of the ring followed by a leaping piledriver only for Patera to then shift his focus on the throat area with chops & chokes followed by resorting to tactics like using the title belt & guardrail that caused Backlund to bleed with Backlund fighting back using the ring post making Patera bleed while both men used a chair against each other. This started out as a normal wrestling match but built into a physical brawl.
May '80

WWE Champion Bob Backlund vs. NWA Champion Harley Race - Matt Striker did the commentary for this match while this was Harley Race's debut in the building as Bob took control with multiple slams & headlock takeover throughout the first half of the match as Harley was heavily on defense with Backlund quickly stopping any momentum Harley tried to build wearing him down with holds like the abdominal stretch & german suplex before Race was finally able to get out of the box with a piledriver & while dropping headbutts & knees to his face only for Backlund to fight back hitting big moves like a piledriver of his own & double arm suplex. This match wasn't much past a draw of it being a unification title match & Harley's MSG debut as he was heavily on the defense for a majority of the match making it an offensive exhibition for Backlund instead of it being a competitive encounter.
Sept. '80

Iron Sheik vs. Hulk Hogan - Honestly, I can try to summarize this match but what can't be said about it that hasn't been said about it for over 20 years as it was pretty short & sweet with Gorilla Monsoon summarizing it perfectly, ""Hulkamania Is Here!""

Boot Camp Match: Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Sheik - Slaughter started out attacking Sheik with his metal helmet from the start & continued to attack with headbutts before Sheik was able to whip Slaughter into the corner with such force that it sent him over the top rope & whipping him with a belt as both men traded hard hits with Slaughter bleeding & Sheik focusing on the cut with biting & punches only for Slaughter to return busting open Sheik with his steel toe boot & punching the cut followed by both men attempting to get their hands on Sheik's loaded boot. This was one of the most famous matches in the history of MSG as it was one of the most violent bloody brawls that has stood the test of time to this day.
June '84

Hulk Hogan & Mr. T vs. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff - The main event of the very first WrestleMania with Bob Orton & Jimmy Sunka in the corner for their teams, Liberace as the guest timekeeper, baseball personality Billy Martin as the ring announcer, Pat Patterson as the inside referee, and boxing legend Muhammad Ali was the outside enforcer. Mr. T & Roddy Piper started off trading slaps with T getting some amateur wrestling moves in before all six men would eventually end up in the ring brawling causing Ali to get in the ring to take control. Hogan was singled out getting worked over both in the ring with double teaming in the corner & on the outside with Piper using a chair before focusing on T keeping him down putting all of their weight on him before eventually all hell broke loose again with the corner men getting involved & eventually being the deciding factor in the match resulting in what was a fun tag match for it's time.
As a side note, Jesse Ventura's commentary is removed from this match.

[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; Born To Controversy: The Roddy Piper Story; True Story Of WrestleMania]

Andre The Giant & Paul Orndorff vs. Roddy Piper & Bob Orton - All four men started brawling in the ring with Piper being in the middle of a slap fight between Andre & Orton with Orton not helping the situation accidentally hitting Piper with his cast which all of this happening within the opening minute as Andre was dominate against both men individually & both at the same time while focusing directly on Orton's cast ripping it apart & trying to break it off. This tag match was pretty short but very entertaining from start to finish.

Intercontinental Champion Mr. Perfect vs. Bret Hart - Stu & Helen Hart were in the crowd for this match as Bret took control in the early moments hip tossing Perfect onto his out of the ring right away & grounding him with a side headlock takedown as Perfect kept trying tactics to mount offense such as pulling Bret's hair only for Bret to either counter or do it right back to him to the point where Perfect attempted to just walk away only for Bret to throw him back in ripping his singlet in the process. Perfect resorted to dirty tactics in order to finally gain some momentum pushing Bret off the apron into the guardrail & working over his neck with moves like the snap neckbreaker while being able to counter Bret's own crucifix into a samoan drop before Bret started fighting back including tossing Perfect into the corner in such a way that he crotched the post with both men exchanging close near falls on each other. This is a pure wrestling fans dream here and tons of credit here goes to Mr. Perfect for putting on this type of performance with a back injury that would keep him out of the ring for over a year as this was the match that put Bret Hart on the map as a solo star along with the debut of the Sharpshooter.

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ring post. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him ""making an ass"" of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, ""He Is Superman!""

[nWo: Back In Black (shown during documentary)]

Elimination Match: Rocky Maivia, Marc Mero, The Stalker, Jake Roberts vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Crush, Goldust, Jerry Lawler - It should be noted that Sunny joined Jim Ross & Vince McMahon on commentary here that resulted in some bickering between her & Ross while Jake Roberts replaced an injured Mark Henry (the first of many injures in his career). The main story of this match was the debut of the man we now know as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson but here, he was Rocky Maivia & built as WWE's first 3rd generation athlete taking the combining the names of his grandfather & dad...and it's also ironic that there are 3 other generational wrestlers in this match as well. This was one of those matches that told various stories such as Hunter avoiding Mero throughout the contest & the issues between Jake Roberts & Jerry Lawler but this was ultimately a showcase for Rocky but a solid encounter overall.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Hunter Hearst Helsmley - This was originally scheduled to be Dude Love participating but thanks to an entertaining video the ""3 Faces Of Foley"", we saw the WWE debut of Cactus Jack & started the match with a bang by nailing Hunter in the head with the trash can followed by a neckbreaker on the concrete floor. Both men fought backstage & back to the ring with Chyna making her presence known while Cactus used the fire extinguisher & even breaking the guardrail before missing a move that caused him to land on the metal trash can. Hunter showed he was no stranger to dishing out the offense himself as he used a mop handle, chair, snow shovel, and trash can while suplexing Cactus on the metal ramp but it was when they made their way to the top of the entrance where a piledriver was given that you can to see to believe. Definitely one of the wildest brawls in RAW history.

[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses; Falls Count Anywhere]

Tables Match: Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz - This was the first ever Tables Match in WWE history & the Hardys knew that it was going to be so dangerous that they forbid Terri to be at ringside as both teams started brawling in the isleway with Jeff on the receiving end of a full nelson powerbomb in the opening seconds before the tables were brought into play right away such as Jeff having a table thrown at him in mid-air only for the Hardys to counter by bringing out ladders & chairs resulting in some stiff chairshots by both teams & Hardys connecting with a double leg drop off the top rope & ladder. Both teams had the tables work in their favor & against them such as both Hardys missing their high risk offense going through tables on the outside, a powerbomb through a table that was setup on the steel steps, one man falling through stacked tables, and Jeff Hardy being the highlight reel he is sacrificing himself with a swanton bomb to put one of the Dudleys through a table. Tables matches today are a stable & cliche in WWE but this was the very first one & both teams did what they did in the later T.L.C. series & set the bar pretty high for others to follow.

Chris Jericho vs. Triple H vs. Kurt Angle - The Rock did guest commentary as the winner of this match would face him for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam. Jericho worked over both men at the same time ramming their heads together & springboard dropkicking one off the apron onto the other followed by an over the top rope dive onto both men while Angle & HHH just couldn't get past each other to focus on the match itself as they kept fighting over who gets to beat up Jericho while shoving each other out of the way whenever one had the advantage over him allowing Jericho to keep getting an advantage as he used one man against the other like drop toeholding one into the other & delivering a Lionsault onto both men. This wasn't much past telling the story of Angle & Triple H's conflict with each other throughout the entire match.
""RAW"" Aug. '00

United States Champion Big Show vs. John Cena - The opening match to the 20th WrestleMania started out with Cena attempting offense to almost no effect as Show easily tossed Cena to the outside & kept catching him when attempting offense such as coming off the top rope into a slam or coming off the ropes with a clothesline followed by either moves like a slam & vertical suplex or just punishing him using his size by standing on his back or standing legdrop but Cena kept coming back trying to break Show down by going to his knees before having to resort to some ""thuganomics"" tactics. The match itself was definitely the best match they ever had (which isn't saying much) but was more about the future top guy in WWE winning his first championship in his first WrestleMania match at Madison Square Garden.
WrestleMania XX

Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James - Both women started out trading momentum with Trish taking Mickie down with an Oklahoma Roll while Trish came back with a Thesz Press before Mickie was able to block Trish's trademark head scissors takeover executing her own double clothesline & low dropkick followed by Trish able to catch Mickie more than once with head scissors takeovers. This match didn't go long & wasn't the quality they've had in the past but was competitive for what it was as this was more about Trish's final performance on RAW before her retirement match later in the week.

(Blu-Ray) Steel Cage Match: Bruno Sammartino & Tito Santana vs. Randy Savage & Adrian Adonis - Both Savage & Adonis attacked Tito & Bruno when they entered the cage & still wearing their wrestling gear resulting in a four way brawl with either Savage or Adonis trying to escape whenever possible either through the door or over the top rope as there as the brawling continued with all four men leading to two on one situations, people being thrown into the cage at one point & bleeding including Tito hitting it like a battery ram, and Adrian taking some very bad falls off the cage resulting in him either being crotched on the ropes or hitting the mat & even falling off the cage onto Savage.  This was just a brawl from start to finish with it having significance of being Bruno's final match in the building.

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart vs. Ted DiBiase - Both men started out trying up & feeling each other out with Dibiase not breaking clean in the corner taking cheap shots getting under Bret's skin to the point where he went to the outside after him with punches & even got his hands of Sherri at ringside on the outside while grounding Dibiase with various side headlock takedowns whenever he went for offense but Dibiase was able to get control using Bret's own momentum against him focusing on the throat while Sherri got involved to the point where she accidently allowed an opening where Bret was able to come back against Dibiase with a heavy amount of offense that not only worked over Dibiase's back & neck but also ended up having Sherri taking a couple of hits as well.  Dibiase said before this match that him & Bret had been around each other in different territories for years but never faced each other a very limited amount of times before this match as they showed they had some chemistry but wasn't one of their best encounters.

(Blu-Ray) WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. C.M. Punk - C.M. Punk brought out his own personal ring announcer in Hall Of Famer Howard Finkel while The MSG crowd once again was very vocal as they chanted things in favor of Punk such as ""We Want Ice Cream"" & ""Colt Cabana."" Punk was in control during the first half of the match working over Del Rio's arm & even doing a suicide dive onto the outside at one point before Ricardo Rodriquez got involved for Del Rio to get the advantage & worked over Punk's arm with various armbars. Both men wrestled hard & were able to keep countering & kicking out of each others signature moves like the G.T.S. into a backstabber & Del Rio later doing the same move to Punk's arm, Rio kicking out of Punk's savage elbow drop, Punk going for the G.T.S. another time only for it to be reversed into the cross arm breaker. This was the match of the night & stole the show.
Survivor Series '11

Blu-Ray includes extra comments from Gerald Briscoe & Ted Dibiase & Alberto Del Rio along with extra stories from Trish Stratus recalling her street fight with Victoria, Ken Patera on selling out the arena with Bruno Sammartino, Mr. Fuji's memories, how Road Warrior Animal feels that wrestling in that building makes you a top guy, Barry Windham's WrestleMania memory & who he met for the first time at that event, Koko B. Ware on a funny incident with Frankie, how Ricky Steamboat was able to work The Garden for the first time while working for Jim Crockett, Sika's ideas on how you had to work harder for that audience than anywhere else, Rocky Johnson on his first match in MSG, Edge's thoughts of Hulk Hogan's first title win, how the Brooklyn Brawler was able to wrestle in The Garden then watch his match on the MSG Network at home the same night, and the MSG Walk Of Fame induction of Vince McMahon.

Normally I would have given this set four stars for the performance quality but the heavy amount of repeats along with some of the matches being poor match quality or unimportant to the history of WWE in the building in favor of others that would have been better selections for that reason bring it down a star so overall this is a ""mixed bad"" so I would only recommend this if you don't have many of these matches in your previous DVD collection.",1380240000,12,23369,4.537841043890866
5737570,1,B00CS7PJY0,"Sometimes I honestly don't know what goes through the minds of the people who makes these DVD's.  The WWE had a golden opportunity here to put out a classic DVD set with never before seen footage, awesome contests, etc.  Instead, they dropped the ball.

The first match is Ivan Koloff taking on Pedro Morales for the world title.  Very slow and plodding match.  I think this match has been released before and honestly, this is not the best way in the world to start a DVD of this importance.

The second match is Bruno Sammartino taking on Superstar Billy Graham for the world title.  Another slow match but at least it's with two of the best in the company for the time period.  Good match but Bruno had far better one's than this one.

Up next is a great match for the world title in a Texas Death Match.  It pitted Bob Backlund taking on Ken Patera.  Great match.  Bob would be one of the reasons that I would get this set and this is a perfect match to put on here.  Some people actually said this match was the match of the year for 1980 and other's disagreed.  I think it was.  Really good match.

The next match is another great contest, this time between Bob Backlund and Harley Race for the NWA and WWE world titles.  This was like one of the first attempts to unify the titles and boy what a match this was.  I actually just saw this one a few months ago and it had me on the edge of my seat even though I knew there was no defining winner.  This is a great match between 2 of the best the business has ever seen.  Really worth checking out.

Up next we get the match with Iron Sheik taking on Hulk Hogan for the title.  How many times is this match going to be released?!!  It should be retired for the love of God!  Hogan had so many great moments in MSG and they pick this one!  He should have like 6 matches devoted to him alone.  If you haven't seen this one before then you must have been living under a rock for the past few years.

The next match features Iron Sheik again as he takes on Sgt. Slaughter in a Boot Camp match.  Few people remember just how brutal and physical of a battle these two men had.  They had a feud for the ages and this is probably one of if not the best battle they had.  Great match and worth checking out.

With disc 2 we get the main event of the first Wrestlemania as Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff take on Hulk Hogan and Mr. T.  Again, how many times do we have to see this match.  Why not pick another match from that show instead of the same old same old?  This is a great match but I've seen it so many times honestly I'm sick of it.  Why not pick the women's title match from that card or the Andre match?

The next match is Andre the Giant and Paul Orndorff taking on Roddy Piper and Bob Orton.  This was a pretty good match and actually one that hasn't been released before but it's just okay.  There's nothing all that exciting about this one.

The next match is a real head scratcher as we have Honky Tonk Man taking on Ultimate Warrior at Summerslam 1988 for the IC title.  Why is this one on here?  The match only goes 25 seconds.  What in the world?  Why not pick the tag title match from Summerslam to include on this or another match from that show.  No, instead we get a 25 second classic!

Up next is the Summerslam 1991 match for the IC title with Bret Hart taking on Mr. Perfect.  Again, this match has been released many times as well.  They really could have chosen another match from that card as well to include on the set.  Don't get me wrong this is a classic match and I love watching both of these guys, but I've seen this match.  I want to see stuff that I've never seen or haven't seen in a while.

The next match once again should be retired as we have Razor Ramon taking on Shawn Michaels for the IC title in the ladder match at Wrestlemania X.  Once again, this is a great match but I've seen it so many times I'm sick of it.  Why not pick another match from that show or just another match in general?

The last match on disc 2 is another head scratcher.  We get Diesel taking on Bob Backlund for the world title and it lasts a whole 9 seconds.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have another classic.  Really, why is this match on here?  Why was this match even considered?

Disc 3 starts with a survivor match from Survivor Series 1996.  It's basically known for the Rock being the survivor and starting his big run to immortality.  Again, it's been released a few times before.

After that we get to Steve Austin stun Vince for the 1,000th time.  Again, how many times do we have to see that clip?

From there, once again, another repeat as Triple H takes on Cactus Jack in a Falls Count Anywhere match on Raw.  This is another match that should be retired to the vaults.  God, what is up with all the repeats?  It was a good match but pick something else for God's sake.

The next match is from Royal Rumble 2000 and is a tables match with Dudley Boys taking on the Hardy Boyz.  I won't complain too much about this one because it hasn't been released too much.  This is a good match but again, I think the fans wanted to see more classic matches.

Next is Triple H taking on Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle in a #1 contender's match.  This is a good match and to the best of my knowledge hasn't been released before.  Finally!

The next segment is Booker T attacking Vince McMahon.  Just a waste of time if you ask me.

After that we get a segment where Triple H returns from his first quad injury.  Again another waste of time.

After that we get John Cena taking on Big Show for the US title at Wrestlemania 20.  This match is a good one but could have picked an even better one from that show.  I know they don't want to show Benoit anymore but for the love of God he could have saved this part of the show because his match with Triple H and Shawn Michaels that night was just classic.  Cena and Show were good but not that great.

After that we Mickie James taking on Trish from Raw.  This was a great match.  These two always worked well with each other and this is just another example of that.

Next we get John Cena returning to win the Royal Rumble match in 2008 when he drew number 30.  Yawn!!  Once again, what the hell were they thinking?  Who cares?

Lastly, we get D-X taking on Chris Jericho and Big show taking on John Cena and Undertaker.  This is a good match but it's too little too late to save this piece of crap set.

I love the last segment which is entitled, ""Great moments happen here.""  Well why in the world didn't you show any of them?

For the Blu-Ray bonus matches you get, first up a cage match with Bruno Sammartino and Tito Santana taking on Randy Savage and Adrain Adonis.  Great match.  A lot of good work in the ring and just all around a joy to watch.  Why is this not on the regular set?

The next BR bonus match is for the IC title between Bret Hart and Ted DiBiase.  Holy crap, another great match.  Again why is this not on the main set?  This was a back and forth classic that went to a 20 min time limit draw.  Very good match and is worth seeing if you get the BR set.

Lastly, we get the Survivor Series match between CM Punk and Alberto del Rio for the world title that started Punk's year long reign as the Best in the World.  This is another good match but I'm glad it's a bonus match.

Wow, what a blown opportunity.  So many great contests still collecting dust somewhere in the WWE vaults and instead we get this little bit of joy!  I mean there is literally only a handful of matches on here that are worth buying, otherwise it's scrap!  You know there were a few DVD sets that for a while the WWE were letting the fans choose which matches would be on the set.  I really think they should go back to that.  We know what we want to see and we don't care about who's friends with who and politics and all of that.  We want to see good solid classic matches.  We also want to see matches that aren't constantly released month after month.  Wake up WWE and start releasing what we want to see not what you guys want to see.",1379721600,12,8051,4.139805825242719
5737571,4,B00CS7PJY0,I wasn't going to buy this based on the reviews but I decided to anyway. And I am glad I did because while it does have some flaws I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was nice to see wrestlers I have not seen on releases before such as Ivan Koloff and for the first time ever matches with Bruno Sammartino. One of the flaws is the repeat matches from other dvds but I chose to look at the good stuff.,1378771200,,392,3.9746835443037973
5737572,3,B00CS7PJY0,"While most of the written reviews are true in their point, I would give the DVD 3 STARS, totally based on the 1st disc ALONE: Koloff vs Morales, Graham vs Sammartino, Backlund vs Patera in a Death match, same with  Slaughter vs Iron Shiek, Hogan vs Iron Shiek (though we have seen many times, still is good from historical perspective), Backlund vs Race (world title vs world title) and from disc 2: Andre/Orndorff vs Piper/Orton.
I believe with some that between Sammartino and Backlund, both whom I think deserve their OWN DVD set, they both held the title for over 10 years and definitely have great matches, and should have been listed. Disc 1 though - should get. I will be interesting how they do the The History of the WWE.",1378771200,,730,4.572519083969466
5737573,2,B00CS7PJY0,"great idea, lousy execution..no way is this DVD representative of the BEST of madison square garden wrestling...let me list some evidence...no gorilla monsoon matches, no valient brothers, no black and white matches from the glorious 1960's...only one sammartino defense, no pedro morales defenses, no freddie blassie matches, and worst of all, even though you had the parade of performers telling us how special MSG was and is, you get no real feeling on the DVD of why...bad job here",1378598400,7,485,5.151898734177215
5737574,2,B00CS7PJY0,"The WWE comes out with a release selectively for us WWF nerds out there, and then tells us to go F ourselves, because we can't make any money off of you, so let's release this random listing of two new matches and then pepper it with the same old shit we always hype.  And then when it bombs, we can blame it on the new matches, not the same old HHH-HBK-Cena-Orton that we get year after year after year.  We want new old stuff. Not the stuff we DVR'd and didn't care about in the first place.  Seriously, the Best of WWF in MSG is a pretty limited audience anyway, so why not give us what we want, which is basically any match from 1970-1990.",1378598400,5,643,4.128
5737575,1,B00CS7PJY0,"Nothing and I mean nothing that John Cena does should merit ANY ""best of"" or ""greatest ever"" list.  I still to this day haven't seen a great match from this guy. The 70s you had Ric Flair, the 80s you had Hulk Hogan, the 90s / early 00s you had Stone Cold, HBK, the Rock and the Hitman....now you've got John Cena. Such a downgrade.  If you grew up a wrestling fan you should feel cheated.

A lot of the material on here can be found on so many other WWE DVD sets....the HBK ladder match is a prime example of this. Don't waste your money.",1378080000,5,539,4.066037735849057
5737576,2,B00CS7PJY0,"I bought the Blu Ray , it's not a TERRIBLE release but not at all what I expected. I assumed from the title that this was to be a collection of great matches the house shows from MSG in the WWF days. I quickly discovered that its merely matches from the garden from the early days all the way up to today...mostly more recent matches. They clearly missed the boat on this one as the WWF used to televise house shows weekly back in the early 80s on there MSG channel..I LOVED THOSE SHOWS! I really hoped this was a nod to those days and it absolutely isn't. Oh well,,on the shelf it goes",1377734400,21,586,4.149122807017544
5737577,3,B00CS7PJY0,The WWE has had such a long history with MSG that it's impossible to do it justice with just one three disc set.  I'm wondering if this one sells well perhaps there will be more volumes of WWE at MSG Blu Ray/DVDs.  I'm not surprised that certain matches we've seen on several other released are featured yet again.  I think WWE was considering the historical significance.  But is there any documentary about WWE and the Garden?  That's what would really make the set for me.  Have at least a two hour documentary with clips from various different eras.,1377561600,,553,4.591836734693878
