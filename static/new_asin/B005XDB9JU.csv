8488596,3,B005XDB9JU,Demons never die is an okay British slasher flick. I don't think it's as good as some other British horror flicks like Dog Soldiers or The Descent.,1395446400,,147,4.481481481481482
8488597,4,B005XDB9JU,"Amber Johnson (Tulisa Contostavlos) kills herself because she is pregnant. This inspires some of her classmates to form a suicide pact. Kenny (Jason Maza) is the lead in the group. He just doesn't want to die by taking pills, but wants a glorious death people will remember. He brings on a photographer to record the events. Meanwhile Arch (Robert Sheehan) falls in love with Jasmine (Jennie Jacques) and they become lovers. Both of these individuals have major issues. They are a few more in the gang, but they are minor players.

After a week goes by, the suicide club decides to disband as they have gotten over their teen problems and opt to live instead to the dismay of Kenny. The movie turns into a slasher who-dun-it, with everyone in the story carrying a knife.

I love Jennie Jacques. She was become the new ""it"" girl for me. I love any movie she is in. I enjoyed the film, but my main problem is that if you are going to have a who-dun-it, you really need to drop a clue from time to time about who the real killer is, as well as the head fake. This movie failed in one area. It also only developed two characters, Arch and Jasmine, which they did well, but I would have liked to of gotten to known some of the other characters with subsequent clues and head fakes. I guess you can only do so much in 90 minutes, which means they needed to cut characters (pun intended).

F-bombs, c-word, sex, near nudity- Jennie you tease.",1336262400,4,1435,4.428030303030303
8488598,4,B005XDB9JU,"A group of `virtual' friends, have one of their number commit suicide, she is depressed after having an abortion. This was Amber played by `singer' Tulisa Contostavalos - only on screen a couple of minutes though. The others link up in a web cam chat and quite quickly come to the conclusion that they should all commit suicide as life is a load of cack and ergo not worth living. The not so charismatic Kenny (played by Jason Maza, who I really like, but seriously we can see your bald spot so playing a teenager was one your agent should have turned down) says it all has to be at the same time. This is a date of a party they are all to attend. In order to gain world wide notoriety, he enlists the aid of a hapless journo wannabe to film, mostly him, in the run up to the big show.

Enter two of London's seemingly most inept cops, who warn of copy cat suicides and that they are there for them. Despite a healthy mistrust of `the feds' they still get invited to the party- yeah right.

Then we get to find out why they are all so keen on meeting God early, one has mother murder issues, one is fat, one bulimic, one father issues, one an hereditary mental mum and one is not only black but also fancies....men! So death it is then, but plucky Archie (Robert Sheehan of `Killing Bono' fame where he sadly, failed to live up to the promise in the title) has a soft spot for head case potential candidate Jasmine (Jennie Jacques). As the big day gets closer they all start to find reasons to live, but just as they change their minds, someone has already decided to give them a hand.

So is it any good? Well I actually really liked it as a casual entertainer, I did not find it very `horrific', except some of the musical score put my teeth on edge, all urban stuff that I am sure the 'homies' would like, but not scary. We are left to keep guessing what the motive of the killer is let alone who they might be. There is also a singular lack of anyone being able to turn on a light switch the moment it gets even slightly dark, which is always a bit tedious, horror can be well lit you know.

The acting is all well above board, the locations aint bad and the music is ok (begrudgingly) but the script is a bit questionable, but if you want a Brit London teen horroresque then this is quite good to while away an hour and a half, but you will definitely not want to see again. The ending may not be to everyones liking, but all films have to end somewhere, even if it is Badscriptsville,and it is only just 4 stars.
