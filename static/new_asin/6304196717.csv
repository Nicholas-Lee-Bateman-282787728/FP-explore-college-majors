811416,5,6304196717,"This is a must own for all Pee Wee fans!  I have had these videos for a few years now  and I must admit I do watch them from time to time.  Not only are these aimed at teaching kids about fire vol. 7,learning about  Hawaii vol. 6, dental hygiene vol. 4 or just plain ol' pee wee fun but the  adult hidden humor is hysterical. I love these tapes.  Where are vol 9-16  tho?  I have 9 and never bought 10-16.  Help !",945129600,7,413,3.8214285714285716
811417,5,6304196717,"We bought the entire Pee Wee collections (all 32 episodes) so that my 3 year old could enjoy Pee Wee w/o commercial interruption.  Yeah, right.  Guilty pleasure and all, I bought them for me.  A Pee Wee fan at 40?  A Pee  Wee fan forever!
Pee Wee's Playhouse is a healthy antidote for kids  immersed in Pokemon and other touchy-feely, Japanese wide-eyed animated  swill.  If you can't get the Road Runner or Pepe Le Pew, then Pee Wee can  put a smile on your face without explosions, bad guys or pandering to  political correctness.
Long live Pee Wee Herman.",928972800,24,558,4.545454545454546

811479,5,6304196717,"My little nephew loved Pee Wee.  He made sure I had it on every Saturday when I baby sat him. I have children of my own now  and bought a couple of VHS for my daughter when she was in Pre-School and she loved it, then my son came along and he is really nuts about Pee Wee, so I went ahead and bought the boxed set.  I hope it doesn't wear out soon.
I can understand the appeal of Pee Wee's Playhouse.  It is bright, funny and very stimulating for young minds.(I don't exactly know its appeal to the older ""kids"") I also like the fact that Paul Rubens doesn't underestimate the intelligence of his target audience.  He can disscuss complicated subjects like the metamorphosis of a butterfly and to funner topics like preparing ours d'eoursves, parfaits and how to throw a great party for your friends.  There are also loads of characters that drop in on a regular basis like Miss Yvonne and Cowboy Curtiss (Laurence Fishburne), the late Phil Hartman, King of Cartoons, Penny Cartoon and Reba the mail lady. And there's even a special where the Del Rubio Tripplets sing ""These boots were made for walking."" My personal favorite.  Certainly this is not all about learning your ABC's and 123's, it's  about learning how to have fun and letting your creativity guide you.
I just hope it comes out on DVD soon. So here's the secret word of the day ""Fun"" You know what to do when you hear the secret word, right??",1070841600,4,1406,4.443579766536965
811480,5,6304196717,I think that this series is fantastic. Pee-Wee is so funny. I have all 16 volumes. I got them for Christmas. I have seen all of the episodes. If you have not seen Pee-Wee's Playhouse I strongly recomend watching this series.,1044921600,3,224,4.487804878048781
811481,5,6304196717,"I just viewed the Pee-Wee's Playhouse videos again after finding them in the back of the closet. WHAT A HOOT!!! Paul
Reubens may be in trouble with the vice squad again but he's a genius at children's (and big kids') entertainment. I laughed so hard at the giant underpants episode that I think I wore the tape out.  He teaches gentle lessons on kindness, sharing and civility without being condescending. . . and he's so funny! All the characters are terrific as is the set.  No wonder the show won so many children's TV awards. These videos are classics.  By the way, I'm in my late 40's and my husband and I have no children.",1038960000,6,628,4.443478260869565
811482,5,6304196717,"I have loved the movie ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" for over ten years. So I decided to give ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse"" a try, since I loved ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" so much. I watched ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse"" for the first time a year ago. ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse"" is a great show. I'm glad that I gave it a try.  All of the characters in the playhouse are cute. I really like the Magic Screen and Globey. Don't forgot to scream when you hear the ""secret"" word!!",1032134400,,450,4.555555555555555

811484,5,6304196717,"Avant Guarde Childrens' television with ""secret"" adult content for the rest of us.  Paul Reubens manchild charactor is given full reign in the best kids show ever.  It pays tribute to 50's and 60's TV and yet stays modern with music by Devo, Residents, Danny Elfman, & Todd Rundgren.  Leasons are learned in a fun way.  Look for Cowboy Curtis giving Pee-Wee tips on dating,  Reba the Mail lady playing Dr. with Pee-Wee, Slam dance lessons and more fun. If you have not seen it since you were a kid.  See what you missed the first time around. Watch for NEW Pee-Wee movies. I love you Pee-Wee!",995241600,5,592,4.485981308411215

7865215,5,6304196717,"Whether he is checking on his ant farm or on his dinosaur family, Pee Wee always remains true to his funny and creative self. Each of his shows wakes up child imagination and offers solutions to everyday problems.
Recommend to children ages 3 and up, those who can talk and appreciate Prr Wee's humor.",1219536000,,301,4.592592592592593
7865216,5,6304196717,"My six year-old son and I both enjoy Pee-Wee's clever fantasy land. The playhouse in puppetland is a child's fantasy of fun characters: some are human visitors to the playhouse, like the King of Cartoons who flambouantly introduces a classic cartoon. Others are objects come to life with puppetry, like Chairy, Globy, Magic Screen, Conky the Robot, even Floory speaks. There are several regular animated film features, like the ant farm, claymation Penny cartoon, and the refrigerator food surprising us each time Pee Wee opens the 'fridge door. Each show has a theme and a gentle lesson. Pee Wee himself is funny and friendly. He is acted by a grown up who talks and thinks like a child, and encourages everyone to ""scream real loud"" every time the secret word of the day is spoken. The interactiveness makes you feel a part of the playhouse fun, for 30 minutes or so.",1127952000,2,869,4.76158940397351
7865217,4,6304196717,"I grew up on this stuff; it's great! I showed it to my little step-siblings and they can't get enough (ages 7 and 10). Gotta love Pee-Wee Herman and his silly genius. I only gave it four out of five stars because in this particular volume he doesn't jump into Magic Screen and sing the ""Connect the Dots"" song, but it's still definitely a worthwhile buy as far as secret words, an awesome theme song, and incredible guest stars.",1091145600,,428,4.430379746835443
