1408655,5,B000059PPR,"Directed by italian director Damiano Damiani in 1967, A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL is a pure marvel released now in the DVD standard by Anchor Bay. Just two trailers as extra features but imperial sound and images justify a must-buy status for this movie.
Now for the actors. Gian-Maria Volont is exceptional in the role of El Chuncho, a rather likeable outlaw who considers that the mexican revolution is a good opportunity to make money by selling rifles to the revolutionaries. His brother Klaus Kinski, as blonde as El Chuncho is black, is more disturbing as a priest convinced that social justice must be brought into this world by all possible means, preferably with the help of explosives and machine-guns. El Nio, the character played by the colombian born actor Lou Castel, is even more intriguing with his attitude  la Clint Eastwood. He's the meanest of all but nonetheless develops a strange friendship for his alter ego Volont.
Four years before Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE, A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL is already visiting the mexican revolution but with an engaged point of view that doesn't leave unharm politicians, working-class people, wealthy ranchers, pistoleros, revolutionaries or americans. Great fun with food for the mind, what more can you expect from cinema ?

1408656,5,B000059PPR,"It's simply marvellous. A brillant cast, first of all Gian Maria Volont in his best performance ever, a well-elaborated and surprising story, magnificently composed pictures, a great deal of humor, realistic violence and political criticism. This movie has it all. To my opinion, ""Quien sabe?"", or ""A bullet for the General"" in the US market, is the best Mexico Western ever made. It easily surpasses Leone's ""Duck you, sucker!"" and Corbucci's ""Companeros"". Definitely a must-have for every fan of the genre.",1014940800,4,508,5.283950617283951
1408657,3,B000059PPR,"Quite good for it's genre. Though director Damiani is not renowned for Westerns. The movie's strong political undertones and theme of budding friendship leading to betrayal is an intersesting one. The fine performances by the two male leads add something special,especially Volonte who is always Good, as is Klaus Kinski in a supporting role. The late Volonte had often said he personally preferred his work on the more political Euro - Westerns of the Sixties than his Leone-Western villians. Movies dealing with the Mexican Revolution have often been used as a backdrop to the Euro Western genre,obviously because of the broad political canvass,aswell as the location of Almeria,Spain. I am happy to see that Anchor Bay DVD have now released the DVD version. They done a brilliant job with Companeros (Corbucci).No extras on disc worth mentioning,but for trailers. Picture and sound are great and film is presented in it's original 2:35:1 (Technoscope). A worthwhile purchase for Spaghetti Western fans.",1005350400,3,1005,5.327044025157233
1408698,5,B000059PPR,"A Bullet for the General is a great example of a Zapata western, a western set in Mexico during the revolution. It is pretty much the opposite of Duck You Sucker.

1408700,2,B000059PPR,"A Bullet for the General is a Spaghetti Western that neither looks nor sounds like the things that have distinguished the sub-genre. There is no suspenseful pacing (part of what makes the Leone Westerns excellent) the overall story isn't very memorable, it isn't really spectacularly shot, the music doesn't stand out and there aren't really any interesting or likable characters (like the Man with No Name).

These are essentially all the components that make up a great Spaghetti Western. Cinematography, score, characters, pacing and story, to an extent. While it isn't a bad movie, it isn't a particularly great one either, and when you have such excellent movies in this sub-genre like the Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West, it's hard to look at this one and see much more. The ending seems odd and perplexing, almost entirely unfitting of the whole rest of the film.",1397606400,3,887,4.913333333333333
1408701,5,B000059PPR,"QUIEN SABE! Aka A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL (ITALY-SPAIN 1967) directed by DAMIANO DAMIANI starring Gian Maria-Volante, Lou Castel and Klaus Kinski is a well structured political Spaghetti Western. It has some strange undertones and an excellent allegory of class structure. The BluRay is top notch and the picture and audio have never sounded better. The film is quite violent and there's a not so subtle closeness between the leads but that is up to the viewers own interpretation. A magnificent score by Luis-Enrique Bacalov. Highly recommended.",1395360000,,545,5.275862068965517
1408702,5,B000059PPR,"Damiano Damiani had one of his exceptional successes with 1966's ""A Bullet for the General"" (AKA: ""El Chucho, Quien Sabe?"").  The director of ""The Empty Canvas"" had just directed ""The Witch in Love,"" another film that could not be categorized as a horror film, although Sinister Cinema has a copy of the film out also as simply ""The Witch"" which is misleading.  Both titles of this Blue Underground release on (DVD and) Blu-ray are valid and are included in the first disc of the two disc collector's edition as the U.S. release and the slightly longer international version.  There are trailers and an interview with director Damiani, who is very much politically motivated when telling a story and it is clearly evident with ""A Bullet for the General"" as he says he didn't want to make a traditional western by an Italian but like Leone before him (the film's star Gian Maria Volonte as ""El Chucho"" (quite a memorable character for this chameleon-like actor was actually a leading actor in Sergio Leone's first spaghetti western ""A Fistful of Dollars"" although that film was not the actual ""first"" of that genre but brought it into popularity) was more interested in satirizing the American western and as is always the case with a Damiano Damiani film, he revolutionizes the genres he is working in to make something unique.  Even his pre-quel in the ""Amityville"" franchise becomes a totally unique ""sequel"" that tests boundaries throughout.  (See:  ""Amityville 2:  The Possession"").  There is a lot of humor in the film but it is not a standard ""spaghetti western"" and has a lot to say about the way of the peasants and working class which seems to become its major treatise.  The second disc is DVD documentary about actor ""Gian Maria Volonte: Un Attore Contro"" which is often presenting blurry excerpts from the actor's films until his death rather recently.  Although it is interesting, it is a bit disappointing as the package of a two disc set makes you think there are loads of extras about ""A Bullet for the General"" and the interview with Damiani is only a few minutes long on Disc One, the Blu-ray, but actually I am glad to know much more about Volonte as he always seems different in each film as he is at playing each character differently and hearing how he worked with other actors, writers, producers and directors.  Top-billed opposite Volonte on the cover packaging is Klaus Kinski as ""El Chucho's"" half-brother who has less to do than Lou Castel as the villainous ""gringo"" and Martine Beswick is on hand with a tad too much dark make-up as a Mexican revolutionary female. Castel's make-up at times is a bit too heavy.  The film is great, but not for the western or ""Spaghetti Western"" genre but for a film set in the American West that has clashes with people getting rich on the poor and their treatment like in Mexico or across the Atlantic and the Mediterranean in Italy and Sicily.  Divergent and effective.  Story and screenplay by Salvatore Laurani with adaptation by Franco Solinas and music by Luis E. Bacalov which was supervised by Ennio Morricone.  Much thanks to Blue Underground for treating it so well.",1389484800,,3138,4.795918367346939
1408703,4,B000059PPR,"I like spaghetti westerns. That being said, I know they certainly aren't for everyone. The genre is marked with exploitation and tongue in cheek humor that can really get over the top at some times. A bullet for the General has some of these elements but never strays from being a movie that can be enjoyed by even those who can find the genre off putting. The story wanders about but the action keeps you interested until the thought provoking ending. Volonte's performance adds an extra star with his impassioned  portrayal of a revolutionary trying to sort out the moral murkiness he finds himself in.",1371945600,,604,4.752380952380952
1408704,4,B000059PPR,"Beginning in the 1960s, and even into the 1970s, many westerns were filmed near Almeria, Spain.  Because most were directed by and often acted by Italians, they came to be known as ""spaghetti"" westerns.  These films were not like the traditional vision embodied in most American westerns in which, for example, Gary Cooper hardly ever perspired or had his clothes soiled.  Of course, this is a bit of an exaggeration, but clearly, the Euro-western presentation of the Old West simply had much more sweat, obviously poor oral hygiene, and suffered from a dearth of washing machines.  The odor of the characters almost steams through the screen. These movies represented what appeared to be a more realistic depiction of the basic griminess of the human condition.  At the same time, most of these films had ridiculous, completely unrealistic,  gun play.  Nothing like saving a guy from the hangman's noose by shooting the rope from 500 feet away (see The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly).  These movies were very successful, as approximately 600 of them were made.  In my view, the trend started with Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars.""  The titles of these movies could often induce an irresistible impulse to get to the movie theater ASAP.

""A Bullet for the General"" is one of the better macaroni westerns.  Gian Maria Volante, who turned in a great performance in ""For A Few Dollars More,"" stars as a bandit who robs trains and supports the Mexican revolution.  I surmise that there's supposed to be a level of nobility as this cut-throat outlaw favors the cause of the starving peasants.  Lou Castel plays an American, sort of an early 20th century CIA operative, who is employed by the Mexican government to infiltrate Volante's group, which he does quite effectively.  Without delving into the entire plot (many others have already reviewed this movie), what I found most striking was not the political aspect but the film's visuals.  The region in which this was filmed is very, very dry. So, if you are a devotee of these westerns, you might consider having a bottle of water nearby when viewing.  And, don't forget the pizza.",1364601600,,2133,4.8805555555555555
1408705,5,B000059PPR,"A Great Western if unusual. It's really a film in 3 parts and any attempt to talk about the film might give away the plot. Suffice to say if you're a fan of this film, this is the best it's ever looked. Enjoy.",1341360000,,209,3.883720930232558
1408706,5,B000059PPR,"Blue Underground's disc contains both the US and the 3-minute longer International versions of the film A Bullet for the General. These are separate 1080P transfers and NOT seamlessly branched - sharing the same Blu-ray disc.  There may be some very slight differences in the image quality between the two versions but it won't be a lot - if any at all. I've made a couple of comparison captures below. The transfer seems a little inconsistent with some sequences showing that nice sheen of grain we often see with Blue Underground but there are a few spots that look waxy - as if DNR were the culprit. This wasn't at all egregious and I'd say that overall the visuals are extremely impressive with great detail in close-ups and depth being displayed. Colors are bright with true skin tones. The 2.35:1 widescreen is used in a slick fashion and the the video comes across pleasing throughout most of the presentation. The US version offers a healthy DTS-HD Master 2.0 channel at 1906 kbps that is comparable to the DUB on the International version that also has the option of lossless Italian at equally as robust a transfer. Gunshots are piercing and the aggressive pats of the soundtrack seems easily handled by the uncompressed audio. The flatness is expected. We have an original score by Luis Bacalov and the iconic Ennio Morricone that supports the 'Spaghetti' aspects very well. There are optional subtitles - both English (SDH) and English - for the Italian version - as well as French and Spanish. Region Free too.

Extras :

There isn't much more on the Blu-ray disc which is fairly filled with the two films but we still get a A Bullet for the Director - Interview with Director Damiano Damiani running 50 minutes in Italian with English subtitles, plus some trailers and a stills and poster gallery. What is a significant supplement is a bonus DVD - Gian Maria Volonte: Un Attore Contro running just shy of a whopping 2 hours. It has plenty of the actor/writer and fans of the genre will definitely want to indulge. This is a very nice documentary addition - in Italian with English subtitles.

1408707,4,B000059PPR,"Although I'm confident it's a minority opinion, I always felt that Gian Maria Volonte was the best part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Fistful-of-Dollars/dp/B00000K0DM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Fistful of Dollars</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/For-a-Few-Dollars-More/dp/B000IZXHQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">For a Few Dollars More</a>, though not in the same league as Eli Wallach would be in the classic finale of the trilogy.  (Who is?)  In 'A Bullet for the General', Volonte takes the lead in a better than average ensemble cast as El Chuncho, a bandit leader whose childish infatuation with the sainted General Elias makes him the perfect patsy when American Bill Tate (Lou Castel) is hired to send a bullet to the general.

First of all, if you are not already a fan of Italian westerns - or at least look favorably on them - then 'Bullet' is probably not going to change your mind.  Hallmarks of the genre - poor dubbing, convoluted storylines, gratuitous violence and over-emotive acting styles - are all present and accounted for here, though to my mind, this film keeps the more grating elements in check.  What we end up with, underneath it all, is a neat little psychological study that adds just enough flavoring to the excitement to push this film past average and make it a minor classic of the genre.

The dandy American, Tate, worms his way into El Chuncho's bandit gang, and it will be immediately apparent to all but the most obtuse that he has designs on something much larger than banditry and running guns for the Mexican Revolution.  Once he is invited into the gang, he meets El Chuncho's half-mad half-brother El Santo (Klaus Kinski), Adelita (Martine Beswick), and the others, and is accepted more or less at face value after telling them that the train they have just raided was taking him to prison.  From then on, Tate keeps pushing to see Gen. Elias - a revolutionary leader hidden up in the mountains for whom El Chuncho is stealing guns.

Throughout the film, El Chuncho's fondness for Tate, whom he calls 'El Nino', causes him to sacrifice members of his original group until only these two are left to deliver the load of guns to Elias.  Without giving away too many spoilers, in the end Tate both saves El Chuncho and at the same time betrays everything in which the bandit leader believes.

Subtlety is not a word that springs to mind when thinking about the action styles of Volonte or Kinski, and even though their actions remain over the top, both these two and Martine Beswick manage to imbue their roles with the hint of something more than two-dimensions.  I'm trying not to over-praise here - in the context of a basic action/western, they manage to convey more complexity than usual for this type of film, which I think really puts the entire effort on a higher plane.  Lou Castel, as the american Tate, is, unfortunately, the odd-man out here.  By design of the director or no, his acting style never resonated with me, or else it stood out at odds so distinctly from the others that it appeared out of place.  His presence is the single most distracting element of the picture.

There is a very anti-American allegorical layer to this film - those who expect to be offended by that may want to pass it by.  El Chuncho, for all his violent, criminal savvy, is politically naive, and easily manipulated by Tate.  Tate, on the other hand, represents the idea that any action is blessed as long there is a tall enough dollar sign behind it.  When El Chuncho is placed between nationless greed and belonging to his people, though, he makes a choice that speaks for the entire film.  I won't say that director Damiano Damiani completely avoids ham-fisted sentimentality - this is an Italian western after all - but within the context of the genre, I think it's excellently done, whether I agree with the subtext or not.  Easily within the top ten of Italian Westerns that I've seen.

This Blue Underground release was nicely done - not pristine, but nice.  Both sound and picture were entirely serviceable, though the only extras included were trailers and a filmography of Damiano Damiani.",1313193600,5,4239,5.041547277936963
1408728,3,B000059PPR,"This ambitious Zapata Western has a lot going for it but is ultimately undercut by the performance of Gian Maria Volonte in the lead role. Volonte is Chuncho, a swaggering, loudmouthed Mexican rebel, who teams up with a mysterious young American (Lou Castel as El Nino) to steal guns to aid the rebel cause. The two lead their gang through numerous adventures on the way to meet the rebel leader (the ""General"" of the title). The Chuncho character is meant to be a profane, wily sort much like Eli Wallach's Tuco or, later, Rod Steiger's Juan; however, Volonte is not up to the task. His brooding, drooling take on Chuncho does not endear him to the audience, and we have no cause to root for him to achieve his goals. He is totally annoying; and is not helped by the exaggerated, cartoonish Mexican accent provided by his dubbing artist. Castel, for his part, is a fine foil to Chuncho and invokes real empathy from the viewer even as we are not really sure where his loyalties lie. The film has an epic, sweeping feel to it and is by no means a failure. The story is engaging and appropriately melodramatic; I would call it a minor classic but for the lead performance.",1267574400,5,1171,4.528301886792453
1408729,5,B000059PPR,"This title ranks among the best spaghetti westerns, and it is in my personal top 10 spaghettis. Gian-Maria Volonte is great as usual and the movie fits to his political views. Too bad he abandoned the western genre after 'Face To Face' in 1967. I wish he'd made for westerns as it is a great pleasure to watch him either he plays the hero or the villain. He played in 4 westerns all of which are considered to be in top 10 or at least top 20. Also check for 'Sacco&Vanzetti' (not a western though)to see how talented he is.",1257379200,3,523,4.24
1408730,4,B000059PPR,"Following with the unlikely alliance of an opportunistic American (Lou Castel) and a Mexican bandit (Gian Maria Volonte) who sells arms to the rebels, the first half hour or so of Damiano Damiani's cult classic is more than a bit ropey. The director has difficulty establishing the relationship between the two leads and resorts to a succession of shoot-em-ups. Thankfully, these are better handled than the drawn out opening attack on the train carrying Castel's enigmatic gringo, in which too many of the ideas are in the script and too few in the execution.

If the first half is the usual running with the rebels territory, the film becomes more complex as it progresses. It is clear from the beginning that the gringo is working to his own agenda, and throughout the course of the film he steers the group towards it. Not interested in women, he professes to be interested only in money, yet at one point kills a rebel paymaster and throws away his cash. Yet even after his objective and the bandito's part in it become clear, the film manages to take the characters even further in an intriguing epilogue.

Both may be mercenary, but finally choose their own executioners, although in very different ways. Castel inadvertently because, despite ruthlessly killing those on both sides to achieve his end, he is ultimately not ruthless enough, Volonte voluntarily, passing judgement on himself when he realises the consequences of his actions.

Castel is a fairly anonymous lead as the 'ugly American', a potential flaw which the director manages to turn to the film's advantage. A moral void, he has no ideals and no scruples but is instead a remorseless pragmatist. The real undercurrents in their relationship are brought out by Volonte; his bandito, first seen literally banging his own drum, manages to avoid caricature. His growing politicisation is convincing, as is his spellbound look of (largely sexual) confusion at the gringo during a confrontation with a landowner. The audience's sympathies are never directly engaged, our involvement with the character more covert and accidental en route.

Hailed as the best of the political spaghetti westerns, A Bullet For the General doesn't quite live up to the epithet but is still a remarkable example of the genre. Co-writer Franco Solinas also wrote Battle of Algiers and Quiemada, and his revolutionary fervour is very visible in the film's parallels with America's covert overseas operations and the presence of a militant priest throwing hand grenades in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost (a less wired than usual Klaus Kinski as Volante's half-mad half-brother). The film even ends with a call to arms -""Don't buy bread, buy dynamite!""",1199404800,15,2709,5.053691275167785

1408733,4,B000059PPR,"ABFTG of my favorite westerns - blistering, hot, authentic looking people, costumes, locals and lots of action and 99% all outdoors.

There is another European version of ABFTG other then the Anchor Bay and the Blue Underground versions.  I own it. This one has a much much better English dub (although occasionally out of sink)  The dialogue and voices in this version greatly improve the film.  Kinsky's voice is much more natural - and closely resembles his real voice, only with a Mexican accent. Volente no longer comes across as upstaging the other actors with a loud cliched Mexican accent and his acting style now seems more measured and professional. The film ends up having better pacing and a much more even quality with the improved dub. This is the version to look for and purchase - but only if you have an all region DVD player. One complaint about this version - at times the voices are completely out of sink with the actors yhat are speaking English.  This issue to often plagues the reproduction of these films on DVD. A similar thing occurred in the American DVD version of Sabata by Sony and The Grand Duel.

My review is for the the Blue underground and the Anchor Bay DVD version of ABFTG. The two version are near identical with Blue underground slightly beating anchor Bay in video quality. Unfortunately I am reviewing the film with the lack-luster English dub version.

The Bad:

The sound quality on the DVD is flat and lacking dynamics and the sound seems out of sync.
The film opens with an inappropriate ""Untouchables style"" narration that devastates a good opening sequence and annoyingly hangs over the beginning of the film.
Most dubbing actors emote with voices that are too loud. (Will dubbing actors ever learn to talk softly?)
Gian Maria Volente dubbing actor overacts and upstages just about everyone and causes a very uneven performance for Volente. Klaus Kinski seems to miscast in an non-essential role as a Mexican bandit as he is dubbed with a ludicrous and cavalier voice that totally ruins his performance.
Shooting deaths sometimes do not appear credible.
Characters make too many illogical decisions.
There is sometimes a feeling of hurriedness or sloppiness in the film-making.
Mexicans are portrayed as one of five familiar stereotypes: lackey solders, addle-brained peasants, murdering bandits, corrupt officials or overly-idealized revolutionaries.
The film is uneven as it jumps from political allegory to action film.
The writer and director ruin almost every scene that could contain credible moving drama by instead choosing to bludgeon us with one-sided and sophomoric political and social metaphors.

The Good:

Many parts of the film are very re-watchable.
The film print is very very good if a bit soft.
Like many spaghetti westerns ABFTG boosts a really great music score that perfectly fits the locations and action.
There are a multitude of similarities to the Wild Bunch just begging for comparisons.
The film is full of great western costumes props, backdrops and landscapes.
There is great atmosphere - especially arid deserts and extreme heat.
There are two very good action scenes - bandits attacking a train and a gunfight in the desert with an old machine gun.
One truly great vignette - a Mexican commander is chained to the train track crucifixion style, as bandits pick off the train occupants one by one. Watching the helpless and doomed lieutenant and his soldiers is one of the most memorable and atmospheric scenes of any western.
Two very good performances - Martine Beswick although dubbed with some bad dialogue is otherwise excellent as the female member of the Mexican bandits. She is absolutely beautiful to boot.
Lou Castel is perfectly cast as a resourceful, courageous but cold-blooded hitman. Castel's ""Nino"", looking like a very young twenties-style-ganster, riding with bandits, all the while orchestrating an assassination is the most compelling aspect of the film. Castel is very convincing in that his calculated innocent voice and facial expressions could con anyone. Unfortunately the film-makers choice of forcing Castel to go out of character as an artless dandy in a sloppy political metaphor ending almost ruins Castel's otherwise perfect performance.
Its a shame that the film makers did not chose Beswick and Castel for the center of the film - they would have had something very special.

Recommendation

I recommend this film to all spaghetti western fans even though it does not resemble Leone films. Fans of the American western may enjoy the film for it more closely resembles the American Western style along the lines of the Wild Bunch or The Treasure of Sierra Madre. But understand the film is uneven, sometimes illogical, tragically dubbed and like most veiled propaganda films this one's silly, and one sided political metaphors get in the way of the entertainment.

Note:

The best Spaghetti westerns are known for their terrific music and sounds effects. There is great music here by none other then Luis Bacalov and Ennio Morricone. But the great music and ambiance are really hurt by the flat sound quality on the DVD. A sweetened soundtrack would have added immensely to ABFTG. Anchor Bay cleaned up one minute of music for the main menu - that minute is beautiful, and full of potential.",1133654400,5,5304,5.039954337899544
1408734,5,B000059PPR,"Spaghetti westerns are, in my opinion, generally the best fictional films about the American West. You can argue that John Wayne made a bunch of great movies about life in the Old West, and you would be right to say so, but for some reason the Italians captured perfectly the specific elements of the era that made their movies seem more realistic. The frontier was a dirty, violent place full of unsavory types trying to get rich quick. Italian westerns capture this mood expertly whereas American films portray characters whose outfits look like they just came back from the dry cleaners. Hollywood films also tend to apply a black and white dichotomy onto their characters, the old ""good guys wear white, bad guys wear black"" philosophy that obscures the reality of the time and place. Not so in Italian films, where even the good guys often have distinctly unsavory traits. It's too bad spaghetti westerns went the way of the dinosaurs a few decades back; I never tire of watching these films even though I am not an expert on the genre. ""A Bullet for the General,"" part of the larger Anchor Bay ""Once Upon a Time in Italy"" spaghetti western box set, serves as an excellent example of how powerful the genre once was.

If you enjoy spag westerns, you're going to love ""A Bullet for the General.""  Like many other spaghettis, the film takes place in Mexico during the raucous revolutions of the early twentieth century. Bandits roam the countryside robbing and killing under the guise of revolutionary armies seeking social change. One band, led by a scruffy looking Mexican named El Chuncho (Gian Maria Volonte), earns their living by stealing weapons and selling them to a powerful warlord named General Elias (Jaime Fernandez). El Chuncho's band preys on federal army patrols, trains, and any thing else that allows them to realize their goals. Along with his holier than thou former priest turned revolutionary brother El Santo (Klaus Kinski) and a beautiful woman named Adelita (Martine Beswick), El Chuncho and his thugs make a good living at what they do. When the group happens to rob a train loaded with armaments, they run smack dab into a dapper gringo named Bill Tate (Lou Castel), a mysterious man who initially poses as a prisoner so he can get into the good graces of El Chuncho's army. Amused by the American and thankful for his help in stopping the train, the group decides to take him on as a fellow bandit and revolutionary. Chuncho even nicknames him ""El Nino"" in the process because of his baby-faced good looks.

Tate's hidden agenda remains hidden for most of the movie, but in the meantime he earnestly joins the guerilla war in Mexico. El Chuncho's band takes the rifles off the train and holes up in a poor village until it's safe to transport the arms to Elias's headquarters in the mountains. Regrettably, the local villagers convince the desperados to dispatch the brutal local landowner, a truly revolutionary action leading to land redistribution amongst the poor. Since the federal government opposes such actions, the village is certain to encounter an invasion force of substantial size. Suddenly, and probably due more to the pretty local women than any altruistic reasons, El Chuncho and El Santo take an interest in protecting the village from annihilation. The rest of the gang decides money is more important than a heroic stand, and heads off to Elias's fortress with the weapons. The now former bandit leader cannot stand to miss out on any of the action (or the money), and before too long is off riding after Tate, Adelita, and the rest of his compatriots. The conclusion to the movie, with Tate's true mission in Mexico revealed and the subsequent bloodbath that follows, is classic spaghetti western grit. Until the very end, you're just not sure what's ultimately going to happen.

""A Bullet for the General"" is most notable for its strident political themes. All spaghetti westerns engage in the old good versus evil debate, but by the late 1960s the directors and writers of the films in this genre began inserting left wing rhetoric and pro-socialist situations into the pictures, thus turning the Old West into a mirror image of the turbulent social movements of the 1960s. Whereas in earlier movies you might see good guys and bad guys battling over money, in films like ""A Bullet for the General"" you see the good guys protecting the poor from money-grubbing big business interests such as railroads, oil companies, and landowners. El Chuncho's conversion from a greedy bandit to a socially conscious revolutionary symbolizes the transformation the New Left hoped most members of society would eventually undergo in the real world. Even the Church takes a shot on the chin in the movie, as El Santo becomes more authentic when he rejects the passivity of the pulpit in lieu of a socially active gospel requiring violent action against the propertied classes.

Unfortunately, a few problems plague ""A Bullet for the General."" First, the filmmakers failed to utilize the full potential of the volcanic Klaus Kinski. There is an intriguing scene where we see El Santo roaring biblical quotations from a rampart while tossing grenades into a mass of troops, but for most of the movie his character simply disappears. Second, the dubbing is awful--truly, ear achingly awful. But the good outweighs the bad. Anchor Bay performed miracles with the pristine picture transfer, the story is intriguing, and there's plenty of good shoot 'em up action. The DVD unfortunately only contains two trailers as extras, but the movie's good enough that you won't miss the behind the scenes stuff and interviews usually included on most discs. ""A Bullet for the General"" is must see viewing for spaghetti western aficionados, and a good introduction to the genre for the beginner.",1092441600,5,5816,4.930612244897959
1408735,3,B000059PPR,"... the General will be dead.
 I'm starting to get it, I think.  The gig with spaghetti westerns, that is.  Capitalism stinks, the Establishment is corrupt and everybody over thirty in clean clothes is likely to be shot.  The good guys are greasy, sweaty, and rude.  They talk when their mouths are stuffed with chicken stolen off the plate of the corrupt property holder.  The good guys are a mescal induced nightmare of the progeny of hippies and Hell's Angels - a peculiarly sixties vision of a union of the odious with the sociopath.
 The Hippie Creed is announced on the international trailer to A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL: ""They gambled their lives for absolute freedom to do as they please.""  Right on, man.
  None of this makes A BULLET an unpleasant viewing experience, but I didn't really much care who was going to be shot next, which was a good thing considering the body count in this one.  Gian Maria Volonte plays El Chuncho, the leader of a band of marauders who loves The People.  Klaus Kinski plays El Santo,  El Chuncho's brother and a man who loves God.  Lou Castel plays the gringo Bill Tate, dubbed ""Nino"" by El Chuncho, a man who loves Money.  Castel is on a secret mission (he's carrying a golden bullet in his valise.  Hint, hint) and to blend in with the banditos he's dresses up like a bank teller throughout the movie.  How did he keep he shirt so clean and his collar so starched?
  At one point El Chuncho tries to explain it to the uncomprehending Nino.  While bear hugging a peasant he says ""He's poor and filthy but he's a human being.  Man the same as you.  Do you understand?""  Right on, man.  Where was that little speech when you were murdering the land owner and ravishing his wife?
  A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL is alright, but it might be a tough ride if you're like me and want someone to root for.",1087603200,14,1834,4.4324324324324325
1408736,2,B000059PPR,"I ordered this with the hope of re-living the atmospheric and operatic triumpsh of Leone (Eastwood Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West).
Honestly, I'm not a true critic, but I was nevertheless let down with the movie.  Knowing Klaus Kinsky and Gian Maria Volont were starring in the movie made want to buy it.  But alas, the Volonte' character of Indio we came to admire for his acting skills and on stage persona, was NOT the same here.  Primarily due to the dubbing.  In For a Few Dollars more and Fist Full of Dollars, we heard the dubbed voice reflected a resonance and depth that is not represented in this film - a different dubbing voice was given... it almost made me laugh.
Buy this if you want, but I was sadly let down.
Bottom line, not in the best Leone spirit and poor dubbing.
save your money and put it towards ""The Great Silence""... it's not Leone but has Morricone for the soundtrack, which is wonderful.",1065571200,3,926,4.429411764705883
1408737,5,B000059PPR,"Franco Solinas' heavily ironic political allegory is perhaps the best screenplay ever written for a spaghetti western.  An Oscar-winning writer, Solinas turned briefly to the genre in the late 1960's, drafting the story for four oustanding entries: ""La Resa dei conti,"" ""Tepepa... Viva la revolucin,"" ""Il Mercenario,"" and ""Quien sabe?""--known in the US as ""A Bullet for the General.""  He reportedly also highly influenced two more of Sollimas' films-- ""Corri, uomo, corri"" and ""Faccia a faccia.""  But Solinas' work is never more topically biting than in ""Quien sabe?""  Lou Castel (in a wonderfully opaque performance) plays a mysterious Gringo who sets up a happenstantial meeting with Gian Maria Volonte's ""El Chuncho""--an idealistic but sometimes naive bandit turned revolutionary.  Gradually, Chuncho comes to realize that the Gringo is an even ""purer"" form of the character Eastwood made popular a few years earlier: an American with ""not much heart but a lot of money.""  Indeed, money is ALL the Gringo EVER cares about in this film.  The conclusion is both cynical and revolutionary--and perhaps one of the most damning portraits of American imperialism (Solinas claimed that the Gringo is a symbol of CIA involvement in Latin America) ever put to film.  Damiano Damiani's direction is at times both inspired and inspiring: the opening of the film is near-brilliant (demonstrating the lengths both the Mexican military and Chuncho will go to achieve their goals) and Volonte delivers his greatest performance next to ""Faccia a faccia.""  Luis Enrquez Bacalov's scoring and Antonio Secchi's exquisite panoramic photography (his one great work) lend the film a style to match its substance.  A movie as engaging politically as it is entertaining, it puts to shame the ""professional westerns"" made by American directors during the same period and is matched aesthetically only by Peckinpah's ""Wild Bunch.""  Perhaps not a masterpiece, but easily worth the highest of general ratings and a must-see for those who enjoy leftist entertainment.",1032998400,12,2041,5.366771159874608
7933945,4,B000059PPR,"RELEASED IN 1967 (but not till 1968 in the USA) and directed by Damiano Damiani, A Bullet for the General (aka El Chuncho) takes place during the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s and involves a gang of gunrunners led by El Chuncho (Gian Maria Volont&egrave;) and enlisted by a revolutionary general (Jaime Fern&aacute;ndez). They allow a taciturn American gringo into their band (Lou Castel), oblivious to his objectives. Klaus Kinski plays the semi-crazy priest of the bandits (I mean revolutionaries) while Martine Beswick is on hand as the babe of the bunch.

This is a decent Spaghetti Western focusing on Mexican bandits. The tone is serious and the cast, costumes, dirt and sweat lend to the gritty realism. The opening sequence where a munitions train is forced to stop due to a crucified army captain blocking the tracks is notable. The script respects the intelligence of the viewer and doesnt spell everything else, even while everything is obvious if you read between the lines. Volont&egrave;, who plays the filthy, but amicable Mexican protagonist, is best known for his roles with Clint Eastwood in A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and For a Few Dollars More (1965).

The score by Luis Bacalov is quite good and was supervised by the inimitable Ennio Morricone.

THE FILM RUNS 115 minutes and was shot in Almer&iacute;a & Guadix, Spain, with indoor sequences done in Rome. WRITERS: Salvatore Laurani and Franco Solinas.

A bullet for the General is a great albeit sordid tale starring Gian Maria Volonte, the prolific Italian actor who helped to make A Fistful of Dollars and A For a Few Dollars More so great as a villain.  This time around he's playing an anti-hero, revolutionary Mexican bandito, who, despite all his faults, you can't help but like.  Lots of action, machine-gunning, and all the other good stuff we've come to expect out of this genre.

On the Prime Instant video, Volonte and Castel are much better voiced than on this dvd they sold me. (I think the Prime version is actually Volonte and Castel doing their own voices; at least Volonte has the same wonderful low-pitched gravelly voice he had in Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More. In this dvd, his voice is high and whiny. Castel has a great detached icy voice in the Prime video, but in the dvd it's a much less effective earnest chatty voice.)

7933953,4,B000059PPR,"'Bullet For The General' is typical of the material that was screened during the 'Spahetti-Western' era during the late
60's into the early 70's.
Many of the faces seen in the film were frequent throughout the series.......
The film is set during the Mexican-Revolution telling of bandit / gunrunner 'El Chucho' (Gian Maria Volonte) who with
his men attack the Presidents Soldiers to acquire weapons they have and indeed guard to sell to the revolutionaries,
not out of patriotism.
When attacking a train to steal weapons 'El Chucho' comes across an American Bill 'nino' Tate' (Lou Castel) who
claims to be a wanted man in the U.S making himself an acceptable addition to his number.
'Tate' brings an added dimension to the group with his own brand of bloody violence...but, why is he so eager to
be a part of 'El Chucho's' bandits, he plays his cards close to his chest.
They attack the small town of 'San Miguel' which is occupied by a company of the presidents soldiers, they capture much
ammunition along with a gold-machine-gun....most of the group just want to take the weapons to the Revolutions
General to collect payment, 'El Chucho' gets an attack of conscience knowing the town will be attacked by soldiers and
it's vulnerable and down-trodden residents slaughtered, he offers to stay and fight, but most of his followers along with
his new best friend 'Tate' but his brother 'El Santo' (Klaus Kinski) with a few others stay to help, however when 'El Chucho'
realizes the others have the prized 'golden-machine-gun with them, he gives chase promising to return....however money
proves to be his master and he and 'Tate set off to sell the captured weapons to the General.
The film does have some good action sequences typical of the 'Spaghetti' film series, however in my view it does lack the
polish and indeed humour associated with films such as the 'Eastwood' trilogy and indeed the Stieger/ Coburn offering.
The disc has both the U.S and International versions on-board with Audio for Italian and sub-titles also for French and Spanish.
There is a bonus disc with the Special-Edition with insights into both the films director and 'Gian Maria Volonte'
The Blu-ray upgrade is good.

7933954,4,B000059PPR,"According to his director, Damiano Damiani, A bullet for the General (1966; aka: Yo soy la revolucin) did not mean to be truly a Western, nor even a Sergio Leone Spaghetti western. Some of the previous reviewers refer to this movie as a Zapata Western, because it takes place in Mexico, with Mexican characters, and with the Mexican revolutionary struggle as the historical background. On top of that, you have an entertaining story, packed with action, and underlined by two very contrasting but interesting perspectives  of political contingency played by Chucho (Gian Mara Volont) and Bill 'Nio' Tate (Lou Castel). So, if you are open to a Mexican rather than a US for Western, the movie would please you. Instead, if you are looking for a rather conventional western, or even a Spaghetti western dealing with personal revenge stories, I suggest you to avoid this one. By the way, as in other Spaguetti or Italian westerns , you have Klaus Kinski playing a secondary role, always a plus to me.

Technically, a very nice HD transfer presented in nice Widescreen format. The movie runs for 118 min (international version) or 115 min (US version). According to International Movie Data Base though, the original movie would run for 135 min. Audio for the International version comes in English and Italian, with English subtitles. The US version comes with Spanish and French subtitles. Extras include the US and International trailers, poster and other photo gallery. Most interesting, a short interview with Italian Director Damiano Damiani. In case someone from Europe cares, the Blu Ray claims to be region free, something I cannot test.",1414281600,2,1641,5.051660516605166
