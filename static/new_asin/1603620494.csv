7800180,3,1603620494,"I am able to recline in my chair and read on screen and listen at the same time. That's great.
The reader does read very fast, though.  I had the NIV Bible on DVD and I preferred that but it is not being sold anymore.
However, for someone who has problem with vision seeing this on the wide screen tv is good.",1360195200,,309,3.9838709677419355
7800181,3,1603620494,"This product was purchased from Amazon.com.  There was a defect in the disc, but I was unaware until months after my initial purchase, then it was too late to send back and request a refund. So far there has only been one problem and I'll try to describe it. After loading disc #1, then selecting the OT or NT ""after"" inserting disc, everything is fine. But when I selected The Book of Daniel ""before"" ever selecting a chapter, instead of getting The Book of Daniel the disc jumps to a 52 week Bible Study Plan, which is ""supposed"" to be on the 2nd disc. I've just not had the time to check out both disc's to see if the Book of Daniel might be on the 2nd disc where the Bible Study Plan is ""supposed"" to be, so I haven't unraveled  that mystery as of yet. I love listening to this version, especially when retiring for the night. I own several translations on DVD so I've had the chance to experience a variety of narrators and their personal styles. All in all the NLT is wonderful version, and I'd give it 5 stars if the wasn't for the obvious problem, not being able to listen to the Book of Daniel. Alpha recordings just aren't the best of the best. I hope that I will find the NLT recorded by someone other than Alpa someday. When I do, I plan on buying it. It's just the mechanics that causes my restraint in giving a lesser rating. I love the translation as well as the translator, those deserve a 5 star rating.",1332028800,3,1420,4.2555555555555555
7800182,4,1603620494,"The audio and video on this DVD are very good.  My only problem is limitations on access.  You can only select by chapter.  I realize that this is a DVD and not an interactive CD, but you have to watch/listen a long time in the long chapters to get to the specific verses you are interested in.  It is really not a good tool to use for specific verse review and reference.",1237766400,4,372,4.125
