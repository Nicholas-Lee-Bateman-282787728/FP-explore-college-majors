8699698,4,B00SXAD4CK,"I can confirm that the only available languages are English and Italian. The only subtitles are Italian. The boxset itself holds three discs, one for each film (""Him"", ""Her"" and ""Them""). Oddly, on my copy, the ""Him"" disc had the ""Her"" label and vice versa. No big deal since the films are there, but for a moment I was afraid I had receveid a wrong set. I cannot tell if this is just my copy or if this affects all the discs.",1437696000,,425,4.195121951219512
