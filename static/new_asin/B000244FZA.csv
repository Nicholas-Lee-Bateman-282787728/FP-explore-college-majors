8021712,5,B000244FZA,"This DVD is from the show, Intimate Portrait, which was formerly shown on the Lifetime channel. It discusses the accomplishments of Caroline Kennedy, Maria Shriver, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, and Kerry Kennedy Cuomo. There are great video footages from when they were younger, playing at Hyannis Port and at Hickory Hill. I especially like the interviews with Kerry Kennedy and how she is helping to uphold her father's (RFK's) visions for a better world through her work in international human rights. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in the Kennedy family, especially since there is not much out there about the 3rd generation Kennedy women.",1262563200,,658,5.276190476190476
8021713,5,B000244FZA,"This movie gave excellent information on the next generation of the Kennedy Woman. It showed so much in this documentry, that it has shown the world the Love, and Family bonds with all the cousins, sisters and brothers that they had for each other. Mrs. Rose Kennedy, brought so much in her children, and her grand children hadn't forgotten the good and happy upbringing the have inherited. Excellent film. I have enjoyed watching it with my neighbor. She herself enjoyed it too.  I recall, the 4 major points in the Kennedy Families that they hold till this day.

Honor God and Family
Education
Love within the bond of Families ties
To be a Winner always

This showed it all. The family was completely united in prayer, in love, and holding up for one another even when their brothers had died. I give each of them credit and they are a  remarkable family.

The Kenndey Woman are surely teaching their children to keep what is learn in the family from generation to the next. Its wonderful to know that the family carries on forward with family values and truth.",1199059200,,1063,4.632978723404255
8021714,4,B000244FZA,"Near the end of this disc, a spokeswoman for the Kennedy family says, ""Yes, they have been given countless privileges, but there are many people with the same privileges who only ride yachts and do nothing else.""  This is very on point.

This Lifetime channel works show that Kennedy women have overcome the adversity of death.  They truly are a united family.  It will be empowering for many viewers to see such accomplished and giving women.  This documentary may be inspirational for many young girls.  Most of the Kennedy women use hyphenated last names.  This will feel feminist to some and elitist/snotty to others.

This documentary was made in 1996.  It really needs an update. This does not talk about JFK Jr.'s plane crash nor the recent electoral defeat of one of the interviewed women.  It doesn't talk about infamous male relatives:  one was accused of rape, another was accused of murder.

Like most documentaries, I wish this one had foreign language subtitles.  I am positive that many people who do not speak English would benefit from being able to understand and see this work.",1115337600,10,1096,4.859459459459459
