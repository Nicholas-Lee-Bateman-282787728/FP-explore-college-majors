7554216,4,B018R8MRNY,"Four and 1/2 stars, really. The acting was second to none in the modern gangster film genre. The washing machine scene brought me to tears. The evil gangster was among the best villains in film history. I wish he had more scenes! Don't expect a fast-paced thriller like Menace II Society or Juice, but do expect the fierce authenticity of those same said flicks.",1485475200,,362,4.671875

7554223,5,B018R8MRNY,"If you are alive and well it's never to late to rewrite your story, and while your at it help some other characters rewrite theirs. I could only imagine the amount of single mothers out in the world, who need a Marcus to overlook her mistakes and flaws to help her build a better future. It's not really about the adults it's more about creating opportunity for the babies.",1484524800,,373,4.420289855072464

7554244,4,B018R8MRNY,"Marcus Carothers wrote, directed, produced, and starred as Marcus Carothers in what is meant to look like an autobiographical film. (I have no idea what is fact or fiction.)  Marcus spent 7 1/2 years in prison and gets out on parole where he finds it hard to stay straight even with the help of God. He gets encouragement from his dad, junkie mom, prostitute girlfriend and gay hair dresser.

The film also looks at his gang/ former gang who run ""Vulture City."" Acting could have gone up a notch. Carothers was supposed to be a poet, but we heard very little of it. (Not that I like poetry or anything.) Film is most meaningful to those who most likely won't see it.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Brief butt nudity.",1451692800,,709,4.48062015503876
7554245,5,B018R8MRNY,"Ex-Offender Stigma is one of the most difficult challenges any felon has trying to return to society. City of Vultures demonstrates the not only the challenge of trying to do the next right thing but overcoming all the triggers, people, places and things that can lead a Lifestyle Addict back into his or her old ways. Excellent film for encouragement. I sincerely hope it is not Mr. Carothers only venture into film making as his English instructor mentioned, he has a gift. More films demonstrating change IS possible would be a welcome venue over the street films glorifying the lifestyle. Good work!!!!",1451606400,4,606,4.950980392156863
7554246,5,B018R8MRNY,In all honesty one of the best Indie movies of 2015. Very Real. It is just as good as Vulture City part 1. Once again good job Marcus Carothers!,1451174400,,144,4.0
7554247,2,B018R8MRNY,"The movie is very low budget and shows some typical black crime with very very bad acting. This thing is more like a high school play and I definitely would not spend money on it as I saw it for free. Movies like "" Lean on Me"" are much better. If you want to watch black foolishness, you can see as much as you want on you tube and skip this. I estimate the budget was probably a couple of grand to make this.",1450137600,4,409,3.880952380952381
