8330838,4,B001OMT62G,"Japan's major TV network NHK over the years has produced a series of fine arts programs for broadcast, using their own concert halls. As recently as a few decades ago American radio and TV networks had their own performance halls and even orchestras. Dynamic has licensed some of the NHK series and produced a series of DVDs.
Renata Scotto (b. 1934) is one of the great Italian sopranos of the 20th century having had a major career in Italy and the US. She had a long contract at the MET (although sometimes contentious) and was one of the first singers to gain a wide following thru the medium of television.
This recital from 1984 was given toward the end of her active career. It is focused mainly on rarely encountered songs by Italian classical composers as well as a few arias by Verdi, ""Tu che le vanita"" and Puccini, ""Vissi d'arte"" and ""Tu, Tu! Piccolo Iddio"".
Throughout, she is in good voice and despite being over 30 years into her career she has good 'piano' singing. Once she gets past 'forte' there is a tendency toward some wobble. She doesn't really need to sing that loudly because she controls her resonance well and the hall is sympathetic - and so is the audience. She has the voice and pacing to allowing her a longer recital, 84 minutes here.
And one of the big bonuses of this recital which is easily missed because it's not on the same program as the recital itself you have to go back to the menu and select extras, is a mad scene from Lucia that Was recorded in Tokyo in 1967 as part of the famous MET tour of Japan in 1967. I hed not seen this being otherwise available as a video although it may be.
In any case here you're able to get the Mad Scene, itself, in color, featuring Scotto. And that is very good illustrative as you get to hear the voice at its peak, which serves to illustrate 'then and now'. It also shows how much weight she lost, she claims because she was self-conscious due to TV.
When I listen to the Carelli and Tebaldi video recitals in the same series, I was wishing that viewers had a way to reference how their voices sounded 15 years earlier. If you don't have the earlier voice still in your ear it's easy to focus too much on the parts of the voice that may be a little bit short these days.
You'll get to hear some charming Italian songs and a few arias for which she was famous.",1413763200,2,2337,4.337899543378995
