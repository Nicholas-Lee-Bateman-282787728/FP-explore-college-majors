8514994,2,B007DIQBN2,"This was a good flick, by 1918 standards, and well acted.  However, is this is the best print available, it is truly a shame.  It looks like it has been duplicated a half a dozen times and a good many of the titles are washed out in the middle.  Enough remains, however, to piece together the story, and enjoy an hour of early 20th Century movie making.  The background music is almost acceptable as well, recordings of tunes from the 1920s and classical music such as Dvorak's New World Symphony and others, and I think I heard some Mozart in there.  Unfortunately, not much apparent attempt was made to try to coordinate the music to the action on the screen.  The fairly low rating I give it is because of the lack of print quality and inappropriate background music, not the movie itself.",1359158400,2,792,4.503496503496503
