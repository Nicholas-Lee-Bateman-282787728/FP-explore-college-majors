8576428,2,B00C2A3BSE,I am hoping my son will give this another try (homeschooling) as he found the speaker very boring :(,1440633600,,100,4.315789473684211
8576429,5,B00C2A3BSE,"I have always been a fan of classical Western Civilzation and am an experienced post-education student.  Life is busy and I just don't have the time to sit down, curled up to a good book.  For years I have listened to lectures on CD/DVD from different teaching companies and I must say that this DVD is a first rate production.  The lecturer is clever, witty, knowledgeable, and has an engaging style that will hold your interest from beginning to end.  It will excede your expectations.",1393977600,5,487,4.694117647058824
8576430,5,B00C2A3BSE,"This has to be the best curriculum we have found for studying the great classics!  We've been homeschooling for about 15 years and have not found anything like this.  Mr. Callihan is knowledgeable, engaging, and entertaining.  He speaks to the students as if he is right there with them.  Not only have they chosen excellent books but all the information that he shares with the student makes this a perfect Literature and Social Studies course. On top of that, they have included a booklet with some of the most beautiful artwork to accompany the course.  It's like walking through a museum.

Frequently, my son shares a story at the dinner table about what Mr. Callihan said.  We all get to enjoy his stories.  It also lets me know he's ""getting it.""

I would highly recommend this to any family interested in a Classical Christian education.  You will not be disappointed with Old Western Culture or Roman Roads Media.",1391644800,5,921,4.772151898734177
