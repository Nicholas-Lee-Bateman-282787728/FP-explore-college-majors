8247697,5,B0012TBIPO,"This is a quirky cartoon featuring a silent bunny that is always doing something interesting.  This bunny is often referred to as ""he"" but engages in a number of activities where ""he"" may dress as a female.  It is similar to Bugs Bunny who is known for cross-dressing.  It is also a family-friendly cartoon.  It always makes me laugh!  I like seeing what the bunny gets up to in these episodes.

I wish there were more of the cartoons on each disc (season 1, then 2 instead of volumes), but it worth the purchase.",1368576000,,513,4.404255319148936
