8500043,5,B006K4ZHVC,"We set out to do this video because we where in India for our foundation The Tibetan Photo Project. I could never and would never represent I know ANYTHING about India. We are not a travel channel special, and as some one else pointed out ""we also don't try to be experts, we are just people that went to India. If you are looking for an authority, keep looking.. but its good.""  We shared the beautiful, amazing things we saw and that touched up. I look very forward to returning and experiencing more of this vibrant amazing county.",1472947200,,534,4.448979591836735

Read the description. This ain't no travel channel special.

They also don't try to be experts, they are just people that went to India. If you are looking for an authority, keep looking.. but its good. and cheap. Worth it.",1455667200,2,431,4.571428571428571
8500046,1,B006K4ZHVC,"I feel very sad for the two people who produced this video, which is beneath home video quality.  The don't seem know bad what they are doing is. Sazzy know almost little about India. There is no story or structure. They have so little footage they recycle shots multiple times. The person shooting it (Mickey)  awkwardly zooms in and out while shaking the camera. They are clearly using a non-image stabilizing movie camera. There is one good moment with a bright 11 year old who speaks English.  He sees no future for himself when he gets to old to quit begging as a the charming kid he is.",1418860800,,592,4.462962962962963
8500047,5,B006K4ZHVC,"Any good traveler is going to do research before going to India. This film puts you on the ground and in situations. We made this film with much of what the guide books told us both right and wrong... We worked to show it as it is for the traveler and in part to a response to what the guidebooks just don't get right.

If you love India, you will love the visuals... it will take you back...

Following the end credits there are nearly an hour of raw uncut extras...

Enjoy this and all our films on Amazon
Visually and respectfully Yours, The Story of The Tibetan Photo Project
Voices in Exile
Save Tibet...Why?
and this one... India 101 hosted by Sazzy Varga

thanks for looking in.",1336780800,,685,4.328125
