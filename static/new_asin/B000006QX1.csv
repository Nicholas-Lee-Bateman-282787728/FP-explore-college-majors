The second hour, however, paints Christians in a stereotypical negative way as being against all educational efforts. It was way over the top and showed a complete lack of understanding for the historical complexities and nuances of the period. For this reason, I rated the video overall as being 3 stars. I do hope they will release it as a DVD.",1137715200,,615,4.590909090909091
