8082510,2,B000B6N5Z0,"Handel was german originally, so it is quite normal for Arnold Ostman to conduct Agrippina in the best and heaviest German style of thirty years ago. I just wonder what the London Baroque Players are doing in that boat that is a pure 19th century martial version of this opera.

First the three male soprano and altos have been replaced by two tenors and one baritone. That destroys an enormous proportion of Handel's art. It is bad enough when they use female sopranos where Mozart must have used castratos. But to recompose the work to eliminate the castratos and the musical range they represented is not a distortion: it is a cultural crime. Apparently that was done in the 19th century for simple enough reasons. But why and how could that be still done in 1983-85 in Germany with the London Baroque Players?

Richard Strauss for example managed the problem by using female sopranos for the young boys and young men he wanted on the stage. The Rosenkavalier is a female soprano for one example, which could today be repaired and sung by a male soprano or a male alto. But Richard Strauss did not have any choice in Germany in his time. But it is no longer the case in England or in Germany in the last quarter of the 20th century. This is an unacceptable mutilation of a work of art that can be performed properly and it could in 1980+.

The second remark is the extremely bad quality of the actors for the parts. Nero is 17 when he becomes emperor and his mother is 39. And all the others are in that bracket between 17, or maybe even younger for Poppea, and 35 with one exception: Claudius who was 64 when Nero became emperor. Agrippina is a more than mature woman with a corpulence that has nothing to do with what she was. Ottone is too old and his behaviour is not that of a young man in love, far from it, who is maybe slightly shy and timid in front of the emperor and women. Narciso is in no way the obese character that is put on the stage with his tenor voice instead of that of a male soprano. Claudio in that gallery of people too old for their parts seems to be too young since he is supposed to be 25 years older than Agrippina and he is far from being that on the stage. In Handel's time they were well obliged to respect these age ranges because life expectancy was not that long, even for opera singers. It would have seemed incredible in Handel's time to have a singer on a stage that could be over 50 and all singers tio be between 35 and 60.

The music is also played with modern instruments and a lot too powerfully and systematically trying to homogenize the various instruments of the orchestra into one single mash, which is definitely going against Handel's art. The music is too heavy and at times on the verge of umpapa brass band rendition.

On the other hand the plot is so well emphasized, cut up and set up that we have no difficulty following the fake letter, the fake succession, the surprise arrival of Claudius, etc. In fact the plot is made too rigid and there is no possible variation or hesitation or blurred situations. That is deadly for characters like Nero who is a childish pubertal capricious little pest, or Ottone who is a shy, hesitant and unsure lover and politician as well as military officer, probably, except if he compensates his shyness in his military occupation by too much authority. And I will not speak of poor Agrippina who is improvising a strategy that runs amok all the time and the pitiful Poppea who is fooling around with any male in sight to the point she nearly got her wings scorched.

The costumes were borrowed from David's paintings of Napoleon I's imperial fashion with high waistlines for women and all kinds of coats and hats for men. In Handel's time the opera singers were dressed in the court fashion of their time not in that 19th century French style.

This version of this opera is not worth much and I am surprised it came out at all.

Me, I'd have no hesitation; I'd go for the musical values and grit my teeth at the fright wigs. In fact, I've already done so; you can read my review of the French production starring Veronique Gens and Philippe Jarrousky -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Handel-Agrippina/dp/B0002KPIKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Handel: Agrippina</a>&nbsp;- right here on amazon.

This production at the Schwetzingen Opera Festival was filmed in 1985, with Arnold stman conducting the London Baroque Players. The colors are a bit dingy, suggesting that it was filmed for TV, but the sound recording is quite good, better in fact than most opera films of that era. Unfortunately, that high fidelity serves mostly to expose the singers' shortcomings, particularly their rather inconsistent tuning. Barbara Daniels has the largest role, as Agrippina, and she doesn't come close to the vocal virtuosity of Veronique Gens in that other production. Baritone David Kuebler sings the role of Nerone an octave lower than Handel would have expected, since the music was composed for a castrato. Philippe Jaroussky, the premiere male soprano of our times, sings Nerone in the other production, and yes, his is the fright wig even I have to sneer at, but his singing is luscious. Kuebler wears a smirk on his face throughout that evokes the malformed character of Nero quite aptly, but his singing is too blunt an instrument for Handelian arias. Gens and Jaroussky are so much better musically than their counterparts that I'd recommend taking off your glasses or dimming your TV screen to hear them if you simply can't bear their costumes.

Comparing these two productions is quite a clear revelation of how much higher the standard of vocal technique in baroque operas has become over the last 25 years.",1321920000,4,1991,5.461038961038961
8082512,5,B000B6N5Z0,"Handel - Agrippina / Daniels, Kuebler, Hall, von Kannen, Ostman, Schwetzingen Opera Festival is a 1985 production staged by Michael Hampe. Swedish conductor Arnold stman leads the London Baroque Players. stman conducts beautifully and his pace is right on the mark.  The stage design by Mauro Pagano is very traditional and being a traditionalist this absolutely my cup of tea. The sound quality is superb. I also love the costumes. A very enjoyable and stunning production not to be missed. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.",1319932800,2,523,5.226190476190476
8082513,5,B000B6N5Z0,"I've not seen the two competitive DVD's of this opera currently listed by Amazon so make no comparative judgments.
This is a fine production in every respect: song, scenery, acting, costumes. Not being purist in that regard, even were I to have found the director straying from the original, it would not bother me so long as the result is entertaining. This was quite entertaining with the humor delivered without blatant clowning and the arias sung engagingly and to good effect. Certainly one is able to grasp each of the central characters and take pleasure in their devious maneuvering to obtain their objectives. If you are the average viewer, I am confident that you will be gratified by this offering.
And, oh that Handel music!",1233964800,5,736,4.896
8082514,3,B000B6N5Z0,"While this 1985 performance by the Koln Opera at the Schwetzingen Opera Festival shares a few of the faults of its only other DVD competition, most notably in the transposition of roles, the direction by Michael Hampe is unobtrusively enjoyable and, as usual with his productions, boasts breathtakingly beautiful sets and costumes by Maruo Pagano. The orchestra and conductor are exemplary period performers and are a delight to listen to and while none of the rest of the cast can match Barbara Daniels' high level of dramatic and vocal delivery it is, by and large, a most enjoyable experience. I'd have been quite happy to sit through this performance in the theatre and, until a better recording comes along, will be content revisiting this DVD.",1218240000,12,749,5.0
8082515,5,B000B6N5Z0,"This is a comedy with a ridiculous plot (modeled after Roman History).  The music direction and orchestra are very good as you would expect of Ostmann and the Schwetzingen festival orchestra.  The sound is good and the four principal singers are good to excellent.  The music is good Handel.  The plot is the machinations of Agrippina (Barbara Daniels) in order to put her son Nerone (David Kuebler) on the throne or as her husband's (Claudio, Gunther von Kannen) successor.  At the same time, Poppea (Janice Hall) is learning from Agrippina and trying to become a major power behind the throne or empress by the methods of Agrippina.  Poppea was a mistress of the miserable Ottone who is cut out of the succession during the action, and is juggling both Claudio and Nerone as lovers currently.  The emperor Claudio is a bore with inflated ideas about his sexual attractiveness and generally not too bright.  Agripinna is a hypocritical manipulator who pulls out all the stops a middle aged woman can to get her husband to do what she wants.  Nerone is a silly self-centered kid who also isn't very smart and seems to be handled by his mother.  All the same, he has a suitably sinister air when he isn't at the center of the action.  Poppea is the brightest star of the group with really superb singing as an amoral courtesan who will do whatever it takes and be as hypocritical as she needs to be to get to her goals.  The acting that conveys this is excellent in a broad comic way.  Poppea's singing is outstanding and she is the one we want to here about.  The remaining principals also sing well, especially Claudio who manages to sing accurately while carrying out the role as a bufoon.  The only complaint I have about this production is the singing of Ottone who has several arias.  His baritone is wobbly and terribly inaccurate.  The only real remedy is to fast forward through these and realize it doesn't mar the action.",1000684800,14,1931,4.648967551622419
