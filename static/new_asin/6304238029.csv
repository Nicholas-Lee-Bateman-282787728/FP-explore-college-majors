811861,4,6304238029,"Jade, 1995 film

It begins by showing Oriental treasures in a wealthy home. A mans voice screams! The next scene is a society ballroom with music from the 1940's. A man leaves, he got a telephone call about a murder at that wealthy home. The police take fingerprints and collect evidence. Photos show famous politicians. ADA Corelli meets a woman for a private conversation about Kyle. Later he visits a Chinese social club to ask about the evidence. That symbol means jade (a precious stone). Medfords finances (the victim) show an $8 million loss. They find a picture of the Governor with a hooker. Corelli visits the Governor to show him that picture. Whos Jerry Brown? Was there blackmail? A psychologist speaks to company executives about people who act aggressively at work. [Ever have a manager like that?] The Governors aide made a call, will Corelli be off the case? No!

They identify the girl in the picture (she has a record). They visit another house on that cliff; a neighbor identified a girl. The police go to her place of business, she runs away until she is caught and taken in for questioning. Will she call a lawyer? She tells about her work, and about Jade. Later something happened to Corellis car brakes! His car crashes, somebody cut the brake line. The fingerprints on the axe handle were identified. Her picture was identified by that neighbor. Corellis lawyer friend talks about his client. There is an unidentified blood sample. Corelli and the police question Mrs. Gavin. She visited Medford the day of the murder, and answers their questions. A recovered videotape was restored and played; it has a clue. When Jade goes to meet Corelli she is hit by a black automobile! Corelli jumps into his sedan to chase it through San Franciscos hilly streets. A parade in Chinatown slows them down.

The angry crowd attacks the cars! [No seatbelt?] That black car disappeared on a dock! Then it zooms out of a warehouse to push Corellis car into the water! Corelli asks about that cufflink. Mr. Green is questioned about this visit to Medfords ocean house. He paid $100,000 for the pictures (but there was a copy). Mrs. Gavin is brought in for questioning. Is Katrina on that tape? What is the Governors man doing at the police station? They find that black car, it was reported stolen a week ago. Corelli looks at an album of old pictures. Katrina visits Corelli to tell him more about her past activities.

She is afraid, she knows too much! Others have been killed. There is another murder. [Note the black clotted blood from the hour-old victim.] Katrina returns to an empty home at night. She is attacked by a man with an axe! Will the police arrive in time? One man is shot. Another attacks Corelli, but he is shot too. The Governor blames it on overzealous supporters who went bad. [Theyre not alive to contradict him.] Corelli asks him to leave Katrina alone. What if something happens to Corelli? At home Matt talks to Katrina. Their talk is recorded! Corelli walks to their house. [The rest is left to the viewer.] We learn who lost that cufflink!

Was this inspired by actual events? A rich friend and advisor to a Governor had a teenage girlfriend who sued him for promised payments. She claimed to have a videotape of a sex party with famous people in it. After she was murdered the tape disappeared. Did it exist? Could she be murdered to silence her in the national interest? Well never know what happened. Some claim a famous movie actress was killed in August 1962 because she knew too much and threatened to talk. The book Beautiful Bad Girl provides one true crime case. The actor who played the Governor later played him as President. The automobiles used show product placement.",1471824000,,3718,4.713846153846154

I bought the dvd expecting something well done erotic-thriller movie.
None of them was there.
I didn't liked the actress at all. She has no charm.
David Caruso was ok, he is always good in any movie.
But that's all.
The story is dull. It tries to show some of Asia's fantasy- beauty and eroticism but totally failed.
Some of the buyer mentioned that not showing a lot of nudity actually helped this movie to be a good one.
Totally disagree.
Since the story is so dull, I only expected nudity.
I don't understand why a good director like him made this kind of stupid film.
Just listen to me and don't waste your time. Don't see this film.

812048,2,6304238029,"At this point it's genuinely hard to believe that Joe Eszterhas was actually the hottest screenwriter in Hollywood for a while in the 90's.  Director William Friedkin very likely made the best movie that was possible out of this screenplay without demanding serious rewrites--but in the 90's William Friedkin made a bunch of for-hire films at Paramount when his wife ran the studio to show that he could be a good soldier and make movies on budget with no off-screen drama so a major rewrite was never in the cards.

Friedkin films everything handsomely and manages to stage a pretty nifty car chase that includes a slow-motion detour through a Chinatown parade.  He gets fine performances from his leads, even the poorly regarded David Caruso.  He keeps everything moving fast enough that Jade never becomes torture to sit through like Sliver and Showgirls--but even with all that the movie is still crap overflowing with crass dialogue and lazy plotting that all the craft in the world can't hide.

If you're in the mood for what is essentially a Shannon Tweed late night cable movie with a big budget and wildly overqualified cast and director then I suppose Jade is exactly what you are looking for--otherwise this is a 90's artifact best left in the past along with Creed albums and Beanie Babies.",1433980800,,1302,4.846846846846847

812204,3,6304238029,"I can't believe William Friedkin directed this film. William Friedkin directed some great films such as THE FRENCH CONNECTION and SORCERER, but JADE seems to be a disaster of sorts. I think the problem is the editing and continuity. JADE grabs your interest in parts and then seems to leave you dangling. Many reviewers seemed to blame David Caruso's performance. I disagree and think that Caruso's performance was spot on. David Caruso is not an action hero or flamboyant leading man. David Caruso is the pensive, thinking man and that is his strength. Putting Caruso in a seemingly endless and fruitless car chase that was frustrating to watch and poorly edited is just one of the things wrong with the film. There was a good premise to this film's plot and a strong cast that included Linda Fiorentino, Chazz Palminteri, Richard Crenna and Michael Biehn, but the sum of all talents seem wasted as the film loses focus several times during the narrative.

Good things about Jade:
1. Gratuitous use of Loreena McKennitt
.
.
.

Okay, I'll try to be fair. Things that SHOULD have been good about Jade:
1. William Friedkin. What the hell was he thinking?
2. David Caruso, if he hadn't been trying to sound exactly like Russell Crowe
3. Chazz Palminteri, if he hadn't been trying to be Joe Mantegna
4. Richard Crenna attempting to use the F-word in a serious conversation, had Friedkin been filming it for laughs

I mean, this guy directed The Exorcist! He's won Oscars! He's good at what he does! Honest! But the whole responsibility for this exceptionally boring film can't lie on the head of scriptwriter Joe Eszterhaswho really hasn't written a decent script in thirteen years nowalone. Some directors are capable of taking mediocre scripts and turning them into fantastic films. Hell, Friedkin did it earlier this year with Rules of Engagement, to an extent.

So what happened here? I don't know. Perhaps Friedkin was as bored with the movie as I was. An old, rather powerful man gets killed in a way that suggests a sexual killing. Over time, the lead investigator (Caruso) uncovers what looks like a very high-class prostitution ring. Hmmmm. Law and Order and NYPD Blue hadn't been doing that sort of thing on television for five years already. No, not at all. Aside from a little more nudity than you'll find on NYPD Blue (and to be fair, Linda Fiorentino is a lot easier to look at than Dennis Franz!) and a little more profanity than you'll find on any police drama, there's nothing here you won't find on prime time.

812499,5,6304238029,"In 1995 I and my buddy Sean must have been the only people to have seen this movie in the theatres. I enjoyed it. Like Body of Evidence and Basic Instinct, it reveled in the sexual depravity that exists among those of the upper classes; and like one of the leads says, ""money, power and sex are what men crave more than anything."" That is a paraphrase. My quotes will come later.

Jade is a movie that could have been better, but still packs a punch. Gene Siskel said it was the worst movie of 1995. He seemed offended about the freaky sex that was exhibited in the movie (Never Mind That There Are People Like That In The World Who Live Douyble Lives. We Don't Live In Afghanistan). Ironically, his cohost Roger Ebert, while giving it a thumbs down, did not think it was as bad as Siskel described. Leonard Maltin gave it Two Stars out of Four.

After a millionaire named Kyle Medford is murdured, suspicion falls on Katrina Gavin, wife of a powerful defense attorney named Matt Gavin. Her fingerprints were found on the hatchett murder weapon. In the ensuing investigation, it is discovered that Medford had incriminating photographs of the governor having sex with a prostitute named Patrice Jacincto (Played By The Gorgeous Angie Everhart). The governor, played by Richard Crenna, is aghast at the pictures and demands them from David Corelli. Corelli refuses, and there is subsequently an attempt made on his life. The attempt fails, but Corelli gets closer to solving the puzzle when a partially destroyed mini-DV tape is fished out of the late Kyle Medford's summer home. The tape shows Katrina Gavin having wild sex with Kyle Medford!! Shortly after this revelation, Patrice Jacincto is slain by a hit and run driver, who David Corelli attempts to pursue, but loses after he himself is again in a car accident, this time thrown over a pier. Again he barely escapes with his life.

When confronted with the evidence, a visibly shaken Katrina admits to the affair but denies involvement with the murder. The movie culminates with a fight and shootout at the Gavin home where two dirty cops are slain and the shifty governor's aid barely escapes capture himself. In the very end of the movie Corelli meets with the governor and leverages Katrina's safety with the photographs he has of the governor sexing with a prostitute. Presumably it was these cops who slew Patrice Jacincto, (Under Orders From Governor Edwards?) yet there is an interesting plot twist at the very end of the movie that worked quite well for me. I will not reveal it here.

This movie, like Body Double, Body of Evidence and Basic Instinct was controversial at the time of its release. Despite the controversy, I quite liked the movie. The sex did not bother me and even then there was very little of it. One of my favorite scenes is where the governor is confronting David Corelli. The governor says: ""If you drag me into this business, David... if my name even shows up on the periphery of this David, you better get the f*#! out of the state of California, because you'll have as much of a future here as Jerry Brown!"" To which David Corelli responds: ""Who's Jerry Brown?"" The irony of ironies is that Jerry Brown's future was nothing but hopeless! He was elected to two terms as mayor of Oakland and (As Of This Writing) a third term as governor of California in 2010! Governor Edwards in must have himself gone down after only one term. His lack of precognition and stupidity for being caught with a hooker shows how out of touch the man was.

Another funny quote is when the mini-DV tape is being reconstructed and run. There we have the three investigators saying: ""At least it's not the governor again."" ""Or the president,"" Hargrove (Biehn) says. ""Oh thank God, I can still believe in a place called hope!"" the overweight cop says this with flippancy. Yet of course his rhetorical statement would in real life become true irony, as President Clinton would become embroiled in his own sex scandal. These quotes give Jade a realism that makes it relevant to today's audience. Unfortunately it is a movie that has largely been forgotten.

I'm so glad to see that it has been reissued in limited print on DVD. As of last year this time the prices were sky high going at $49.99 per DVD. The new reissued DVDs have lowered the prices on Amazon which means I will buy the movie for the first time on DVD. Unfortunately the unrated copy has not been issued on DVD. Why I don't know. According to Wikipedia it is because of poor sales of the VHS that was released. So on last year I bought a brand new copy of Jade on VHS (More Reason Why You Should Hang On To Your VCRs!). I have yet to view it, as what I'm reviewing here is the version I taped from cable in the 1990s. I believe that's the theatrical version that was broadcast on cable. As a result, I will have to view the actual VHS tape I bought to compare notes while the movie is still fresh in my mind.

I give this film Four and a Half Stars. If you liked Sliver or Basic Instinct or Body of Evidence or Body Double or Body Heat, you may very well like this movie. True, there are a few plotholes in the movie (Like Who Killed The Nosy Nighbor Justin Henderson?) that can be presumed from common sense, but only the astute and intelligent will figure this out (The Movie Makes You Think); otherwise, as I said, if you like this type of genre you will be pleased. Buy it and find out if you like it. The price is now more than affordable. I'm the 23rd person to give it a Five Star rate and the 56th person overall to rate it.

812545,5,6304238029,"You CANNOT go wrong with a William Friedkin movie.  I repeat:  You CANNOT go wrong with a William Friedkin movie.  I'm amazed by his body of work.  There are not a lot of films, and I have not seen all of them due to limited availability but the total variety of what he accomplishes is staggering.  And the man is FASCINATING to listen to, more than any other director that I have observed in DVD special features.  Even if you do not watch his movies, you will get an education and a lot of satisfaction just by listening to his interviews.

Jade has received some negative criticism and yet this could be my favorite Friedkin movie.  I watched it 3x in a span of six days.  Jade is only available used at this point.  I first obtained the double-feature set, paired with ""Bless The Child"" (which is also excellent).  But I had to own the real Jade as a single Paramount DVD and I received a wonderful like-new product from a local Amazon merchant.

Both DVD's are fine, but with the single version you will have Chapter stops and a menu.  I don't need those necessarily, but sometimes I get a muscle twitch and advance the film by mistake.  Those 10-minutes stops on 'no menu' DVD's are not helpful if you press the wrong button.  I know... it is disappointing that Jade is presented in full-screen only.

But I can assure you that the picture is very good; the sound is excellent for 1995 - - oh, and by the way I also purchased the soundtrack from Screen Archives I loved this film so much.

Yes, I hope that Mr. Friedkin will supervise and release a widescreen version soon.  I will be one of the first to sign up for it, if so!

Normally I only comment on the quality of picture and sound and leave the plot summaries to others.  We need to apply appropriate pressure wherever necessary to encourage a widescreen version of this film be made that will more represent the vision of this superior film director.

812551,5,6304238029,"Five stars for William Friedkin's JADE, a masterful thriller that is gorgeous to look at but presented in an underwhelming edition by Lionsgate.  The disc has a fair amount of grain all over it that descends into little more than digital noise in a couple of scenes, most notably the scene in the morgue and the climatic night/fight scene.
These scenes turn outrageously snowy/grainy and there is no excuse for this kind of a shoddy transfer.  Making matters more sad, the rest of the disc looks pretty good and there are several scenes that are as beautiful as anything out on bluray (except AVATAR of course).  It is a shame there is no consistancy in the picture quality of this disc.  Also noteworthy is the excellent new 5.1 DTS-HD audio that really packs a lot of punch and puts you right in the middle of the action. Rear speakers blast during the spectacular car chase sequence. The disc retains the classic artwork that has appeared on every edition and movie poster for the film.  The only extra on the disc is a poorly presented theatrical trailer.

It should be noted that this edition includes ONLY the THEATRICAL CUT of the film and not the much longer (and more explicit) directors cut.  With all the much hyped superior storage capacity of bluray it seems ridiculous that studios are consistently failing to put multiple cuts of a film on a disc.

JADE has never been a popular film and has not even developed a cult following so I'm surprised that it has made its way onto bluray at all.  I'm very glad it did but I wish it had been handled with a bit more care. This entire presentation is a bit slapdash.  Still, I only paid $10 for it at Walmart so I can't complain too much.  The overall quality is a step up from the DVD edition and well worth the price at Walmart, although I would think twice about paying much more than $10 for it.",1272585600,,1856,4.4777448071216615

What is the deal!  Blu-rays can store more data on them, so again, there is absolutely no reason (in the case where there is both an R-rated version and an Unrated version) that we should not be offered BOTH versions on the one disc.  You have the room for it--put them on there studios.  A couple more duds like these and I will be through buying Blu-rays.  And a heads up for the studios--please don't have the audacity to offer only one of the versions of Last of the Mohicans when it comes out.

812553,3,6304238029,"I had no expectations as Paramount typically does some kind of DNR thingy with their 80s/90s titles, so I was just hoping to see a nice preservation of some Bay Area locales. By the time the credits rolled on this theatrical BD cut, I wasn't disappointed, it just had some serious issues.

Admittedly, I enjoyed watching this Basic Instinct clone (at last count there were 28 identical/similar characters, scenes, etc.), so between the sights, characters and score I felt sure Michael Douglas was going to cameo any second, but Loreena Mckennitt's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummers-Dance/dp/B0000062TT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummers' Dance</a>&nbsp;version of Mystic's Dream adds a nice feel throughout (although misplaced in half the scenes). The end result is laughable, but I figure one is reading this to hear about the BD.

The picture quality is vastly improved over the other products available; The colors have been enriched, the majority of artifact has been removed, the flesh tones have been glorified and depending on the camera being used - the views of the Bay Area show a decent time capsule preservation from 94/95. The cons: The resulting edge fuzz is prevalent, there is TONS of grain on most of the interiors, and the intermittent artifact/film fade pops up in some irritating spots. Overall - a decent upgrade but there is still plenty to pick apart.

The sound is a mixed bag. The DTS felt like it was forced as the outer channels were getting used heavily, even in the smallest of scenes, to the point where is was mixed incorrectly a few times. The vocals were drowned out in some of the louder sequences by outer channel garbage, and there were a couple of scenes where the post-production must have missed the timing (lips clearly not matching the words). The score sounds clear though, and any time Mckennitt sings you almost wish for a music-only track.

The only special feature is the original trailer which shows how bad the film looked (with a few brief clips of what must be in the Director's Cut). Region coded A.

812632,3,6304238029,"David Caruso, no relation to the famous opera singer Enrico Caruso, looks like an angry leprechaun. As Lt. Horatio Caine on TV's ""CSI: Miami"" his acting ""style"" consists of delivering droll one liners that he seems to think are pithy, pausing mid-sentence to put on his dark sunglasses, and milking every pregnant pause for what he perceives as dramatic effect. He is one -- big -- box (I pause to don my shades) of very, very, very unlucky -- charms. William Shatner would be proud.

""Jade"" was supposed to be Caruso's big screen break through. He made a name for himself on two gritty TV shows, first as Shamrock Leader Tommy Mann (8 episodes, 1981-1983) on ""Hill Street Blues;"" and then as Detective John Kelly (26 episodes, 1993-1994) on ""NYPD Blue."" He dropped out of ""NYPD Blue"" convinced that he was going to be a major movie star. """"NYPD Blue"" will not be successful when I leave,"" sang Caruso -- a brash prediction that turned out to be oh so wrong.

""NYPD Blue"" was a success without Caruso, but ""Jade"" was a flop with him. As much as I'd like to indulge in a little schadenfreud over his precipitous fall, Caruso wasn't the worst thing about ""Jade.""  The fault in ""Jade"" lies more with the ill-conceived script by schlockmeister Joe Eszterhas and the egregious direction of William Friedkin. Both writer and director are capable of good work, as evidenced by Eszterhas' ""Basic Instinct,"" and Friedkin's ""The French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist;"" but then there is ""Show Girls,"" and ""Sliver,"" for Eszterhas, and ""Cruising"" for Friedkin. By 1995 both the writer and the director are much too jaded.

Nothing succeeds like excess, except when it crosses the line. In ""Jade"" the line that is crossed repeatedly is the line separating a well crafted story that makes sense -- when the final mystery is revealed, all the pieces fall into place -- and a story that makes no sense whatsoever: car chases, explosions, kinkiness, anything to shore up the viewer's flagging interest. All totally gratuitous and inserted into the narrative merely for cheap thrills and titillation.

------------------------------
Bob Hargrove: You ever take it like that, Corelli?
David Corelli: Is that an offer, Inspector?
Bob Hargrove: You wish.
===========================================

I have nothing against cheap thrills and titillation per se, but can't there be at least a thin veneer of intelligence for it to hide behind? If the story is not entirely plausible, can't it at least be possible according to the laws of physics? In ""Jade"" there is a car chase that begins in Washington Square, and then suddenly, as if you went through a wormhole in the time-space continuum, you emerge in Chinatown. Sure, that isn't as bad as the impossible topography of ""Bullitt"" but what really sticks in my craw about this car chase is that when they take that Chinatown detour, they drive through the Lunar New Year Parade -- two cars plowing through the crowds, slaying dragons and onlookers alike -- yet no police join the chase, the two vehicles are left to their own devices. There are no repercussions, no consequences. The whole unfortunate mess causes barely a ripple. A hit and run with that many witnesses and victims would have been reported, and there would be a massive police response. This is but one example of the many gaps in logic and common sense on display in ""Jade.""

Chazz Palminteri was superb as Phil in ""Hurlyburly"" a sociopath who threw his date out of a moving car on the way to a Jack in the Box, but do I buy him as a high priced attorney? No, he never could have passed the bar exam. Linda Fiorentino is supposed to be a femme fatale, but the evidence, like in the John Wayne Bobbitt and Lorena Bobbitt case, just doesn't stand up in court. Fiorentino may have been hotter than July in ""The Last Seduction"" but ""Jade"" falls in another month altogether.

""Jade"" was a muddled mess, but it would be fun to watch in a Mystery Science Theater 3000 context where you could mock and make fun of the movie as it unfolded. It is not so bad it's good, like ""Show Girls,"" but it is bad enough to mock.

812633,2,6304238029,"This movie came out when I was in middle school and a virgin, so needless to say my parents refused to let me see it and with good reason. I finally (at 27) got my hands on it,and I don't blame my parents anymore... The movie focuses on  Katrina Gavin a psychologist who is the prime suspect in a very pathetic little murder- sex- mystery. The film pins her ( pun included) against her cheating husband, a defense attorney and a hot shot district attorney ( yes, brace yourself David Caruso). What ensues is  a world of high class hookers, totally not enticing sex scenes ( Im sorry but I've seen better ;), and the governor caught with his pants down! Before you wonder who could come up with such a brilliant script, its none other than Joe Esterhouse, who only reached his one and only ""prime"" with Basic instinct. The story isn't awful , but its not decent either, coupled with it also dragging on for what seems like hours. The soundtrack is ok, but the story could have been better, kinda glad I was too young for it when it came out.",1249776000,,1040,4.355670103092783
812634,5,6304238029,"Better than the theatrical version.  The extra scenes added more depth and development for each of the characters.  Better than what the critics would have you believe.  Also another spectacular car chase filmed by the director who created car chases with ""The French Connection"" and ""To Live and Die in L.A.""  Excellent thriller i give it a 7.5 out of 10.  I wish the film was successful.  Oh well.....",1249430400,,403,4.768115942028985

812637,4,6304238029,"Jade is a brilliant film. William Fredkin has a done wonderful job with this sexually charged thriller. The cinematography during the car chase is awe insprining and the sex scenes are kinky and tastefully done. Linda Forentiono and Angie Everhart who both have great bodies make the film even better. The reason I like this movie is because of David Caurso he displays some of his best acting on screen, very similiar to the NYPD Blue days.",1221955200,,441,4.740259740259741
812638,4,6304238029,"Make no mistake: (1) this IS a sordid crime story and (2) is is FAR better than the national critics would have you believe. I have found it fascinating the three times I've watched it and look forward to seeing it again. It surprises me each time, being better than I remembered. It's nicely photographed, too. Why I can't get a widescreen DVD of this, I don't know, but all that seems to be available is full screen.

William Friedkin directed this which usually means (1) a riveting story; (2) stylish cinematography. That's the case here. I rate this movie so high mainly because it's so entertaining. And it doesn't overstay it's welcome at a short hour-and-a- half.

It's a crude story at times (there was a NC-version available of this, as well), but it's very interesting start-to-finish, has some memorable scenes, nice San Francisco scenery and a nice soundtrack from Celtic singer Loreena McKennitt.",1189987200,,910,4.864516129032258
812721,1,6304238029,"This film nearly buried the careers of all involved.  Nuff said.  It is truly terrible, pointless, and I really like Linda Fiorentino, but she couldn't save this stinker.  An utter waste.  Idiotic.  And the car ""chase"" is a joke.",1187654400,,229,4.769230769230769
812722,4,6304238029,"David Curuso is a great ""tv"" actor. Like William Shatner before him, he over acts his (big screen) roles. I would have loved if they could of inserted Michael Douglas or maybe even a Travolta to pull this one off. I gave it four stars because I'm in love with Linda Fiorentino. Besides that, it was O.K. Just couldn't get that altitude that BASIC INSTINCT got a few years earlier, but it was all right.",1178409600,,402,4.373333333333333
812723,5,6304238029,Excellent movie! Linda is sexy as ever. the story line in dark but the more you watch this movie the better it gets. You will see it different each time. I highly recommend this movie.,1178323200,,184,4.285714285714286
812724,5,6304238029,"This movie is a great crime thriller.  It keeps you guessing until the end.  I would recommend it to any David Caruso fan, as well as anyone who likes a good crime story.",1163203200,,170,4.121212121212121
812725,2,6304238029,"I rented this movie mostly because they goof on it in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin."" I like Caruso on CSI Miami, but I have begun to see that Caruso always plays David Caruso. Yet, here he plays an even less cheerful cop. What fun. His character in Jade is so stoic that he makes Dirty Harry look like a neurotic. Sadly, this is one of those erotic thrillers that is neither thrilling nor erotic. It's better than your usual Shannon Tweed erotic thriller twaddle, mostly because you get Chaz Palminteri as a supporting character rather than, say, William Katt. The plot makes no sense, however, and the sex scenes are boring. If you want good-looking sex, rent some porn. If you want a good thriller, rent Rear Window.",1146614400,,713,4.534883720930233
812726,3,6304238029,I REALLY ENJOYED THE CAR CHASE IN THIS MOVIE. SUCH AN ADRENALINE RUSH. I ALWAYS ENJOY CHAZ PALMATERI MOVIES.,1126051200,,108,4.7368421052631575
812727,4,6304238029,"The use of Le Sacre du prientemps of Igor Stravinsky was a magnificent device to describe the brutal murderer in the first shot of this sordid thriller where Palmitieri as the chess mind and Fiorentino as the sexiest femme fatale after Sharon Stone (Basic instints ) and Madeleine Stowe (China Moon) makes of this film a watchable work . The car chase in San Francisco is a sincere tribute to Bullit but the raising promising script falls down and lacks of real punch at the end .

But luckily the craft of Friedkin saves this film of a worst destiny . Still we expect much more of that veteran director . He is very close related with that scope typical of that master film maker who was John Frankenheimer .

And that is the sin of that movie ; its lack of perspective . It remains just in the anechdotical episode .",1094515200,,818,4.375
812728,4,6304238029,"Suspensful,Seductive,Excellent Movie!! Another great role for Chazz Palmenteri. No matter what movie he's in or what role hes given he always takes charge! I Love HIM!! The movie is based on a murder in the begining and David Curoso is the investigator and he has to figure out who killed ""him"". His best friend is married to his ex girl who you can tell is still in love with. Im sorry that wife of Matt Gavins (Chazz Palmenteri) is a hoe! David has to find out who ""Jade"" is because that will link to the murderer. The Ending is so unexpected and Suprising! I recommend this movie to everyone! Its Great~ but i must say Chazz Palmenteri shows his characters more as a gangster like in ""Bronx Tale"" You Should Be more in those movies Chazz, your the big boss man who takes over every movie i've seen him in! You go Boy!~",1059436800,,821,4.372549019607843
812729,3,6304238029,"A corporate man is found murdered and a D.A. (David Caruso) investigates the gruesome crime. He thinks it's his ex-girlfriend, psychologist (Linda Fiorentino) who did it. Ok, there goes the rest of the movie. Better storylines develop on ""As the World Turns."" All this movie needed was 'small people' with magical powers. But ""Jade"" isn't a typical movie that deals with 'the dark side.' I mean this woman was icy cold (who I might add is gorgeous)! She made Darth Vader look like an amateur. A huge car chase in Chinatown highlights the movie and the direction by William Friedkin is fine. Ok movie.",1044057600,,600,4.778846153846154
812730,4,6304238029,"Basic Instinct screenwriter Joe Esterhas' wicked knowledge of the trangsgressions of the rich and the powerful are deftly exposed by director William Friedkin and Linda Fiorentino. She is perfectly cast as the psychologist and as the illicit liason Jade. Chazz Palminteri, her husband, and David Caruso, a tad young for the role, makes for an interesting storyline. The graphic sexuality exhibited is for adults only but the movie delivers the seedy underbelly of politics and power and illustrates how a woman scorned can enter into a circle from which she has no escape. Unlike the Last Seduction, Fiorentino is the victim and not the temptress yearning for the love she doesn't have. Unfortunately, her husband isn't it either. With Loreena McKennitt's soulful sounds and Linda's great performance, she eventually gets under your skin as a woman looking for love in all the wrong places. Maybe that was the moral rather than Joe Esterhas's preoccupation with all the women he couldn't have in high school (as one critic wrote). Deftly directed, superbly acted, and well-executed. Jade is worth a watch only because of Linda Fiorentino's emotional resonance and convincing performance. Chazz is as excellent as ever. -Felecia Constance Rowe",1033862400,,1242,5.277777777777778
812811,2,6304238029,"The technical elements and the production values in 'Jade' are first-rate - fine photography, a creepy James Horner score and lavish, elegant sets. If you are studying production design or film music, this is a good movie to see.
The problem is that the script is trash. It's not much more than a 'Basic Instinct' clone with elements, such as ones set in Chinatown, that lead nowhere at all. They just fill the skimpy story out to a feature length running time. Of course, if you are studying script writing, you get some ideas of what not to do.
The marvelous cast is wasted because this is one of those movies where the characters do what they do only because the script says they must. AS a result, Caruso, Fiorentino and  Palmenteri can do nothing more than give a little color to their cardboard characters.",1017187200,,812,4.6
812812,3,6304238029,"Not a bad film to pass an evening's time with.  A murder mystery with elements of surprise.  This film will stretch you neither intellectually nor artistically, but it features some sumptuous interiors and locales (e.g., the real Sheraton Palace Hotel Garden Court done up as a ballroom), and persons familiar with San Francisco will enjoy that and other location shots.  Excellent cinematography, interesting music that's not overdone, and so-so acting, but the yarn is at least followable.  I've seen a lot worse.  Nil extras on the DVD, though, a disappointment.",1015632000,,565,5.233333333333333
812813,3,6304238029,"Yes, it maybe sordid but this movie is worth getting out for a rainy Saturday night.  Friedkin plays with color in this movie extensively and the results are luscious.  The editing and direction is top notch given that the subject is difficult to explore.  Friedkin achieves a successful disconnect from the subject matter by exploring the story from a neutral POV. This neutral POV is underlined by the film's lack of a clear hero/heroine and the constant use of abstract camera angles.  If you sort of lick this get To Live and Die In LA!!!",992649600,,542,4.673684210526316

812815,5,6304238029,"It's a nice movie. If you liked BASIC INSTINCTS,BOUND,EYES WIDE SHUT(which are better),you might like this one. I love it! Basically the plot is : there are millionaires taking part in orgies,and having sex like most of us would like to but are afraid of,and there's someone blackmailing them,and a mysterious dishy lady called Jade who is not afraid of exploring sex,who may (not) be involved in the murder/blackmail cases. There's a great car chase-one of the best I have ever seen,and the story is very interesting. But I warn you : If you get easily shocked or offended you will hate it !If you like me,love to watch  movies for fun you'll like it a lot. It's still a whole much better than any porn movie that usually bores the heck out of you after 5 minutes. This one will not. And it's not porno !",988588800,,805,4.476190476190476
812816,2,6304238029,"This film is supposedly an erotic thriller but it turns out to be only a mess. Linda Fiorentino lacks the presence and sex appeal of Sharon Stone or even Nicole Kidman. Chaz Palmentari is cadaver-like and David ""Who Needs NYPD Blue"" Caruso in no leading man. And the cast is just the beginning of the problems. The plot and script are silly though Director William Freidkan tries in vain to raise the suspense. There are some unintentional momemts of humor: the blackmail photos of Richard Crenna have obviously been doctored to give him a seemingly buffed body and the ""erotic"" scene with Fiorentino, a stranger, and some panty hose is so poorly staged it's a riot.",978912000,,666,4.75

I always seem to find a  good amount of adreneline in these movies, even where most people only see  uneventful and boring elements.  In fact those scenes, which can be seen  with amazing clarity in ""Jade"", have a subtle emotional intensity  that brings out a sense of sophistication, and fulfills a lot of reality  within these situations.  It's wonderful how strong this film was in all  departments: plot, performance, action, emotion, atmosphere, and ability to  make a strong mark in the thriller genre.  You will also enjoy Caruso's  performance, as he does that kind of character well, but you won't be able  to forget Linda Fiorentino's and Palminteri's great performances.  It has  it's share of good ol' American film noir intrigue: infidelity, paranoia,  political corruption, and a few car chases, but all of those things are  accomplished extremely well in this film, setting a standard for those  elements, I'm sure.
