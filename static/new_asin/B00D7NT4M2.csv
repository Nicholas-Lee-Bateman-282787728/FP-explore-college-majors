8590430,5,B00D7NT4M2,"Why not delving into Clint Eastwood's personal life, this documentary does cover his career as an actor and director with sheer elegance.  Nothing was given to Clint.  He had to work his butt off and take chances to become the success he is today.  Many of his films are now classics, both as an actor and a director.  I do wish he'd done one more ""Dirty Harry"" movie so that the character was closed for good.  Still, at his age, he has managed to direct one good movie after another, bringing them in on time and staying within the budget, unless many directors.  His movies often win awards as does the actors in them.  Clint is the type of director who believes in one-to-two takes, unlike many who do up to twenty takes, hoping for something unusual or different from the actor being filmed.  Clint feels that if the actors do their job, there's no reason to spend money and time doing countless takes.  Highly recommended.",1438387200,4,928,4.542168674698795
