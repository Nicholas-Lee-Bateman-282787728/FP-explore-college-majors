8701802,5,B00THX0TMK,"This is a very nice collection. Many of these inexpensive sets use poor copies that are often fuzzy with poor sound. While these aren't digital restorations, they are clear pictures with clear sound. I recommend the set if, for nothing else, ""British Intelligence"" starring Boris Karloff.",1527379200,,288,5.282608695652174
8701803,5,B00THX0TMK,"The ten films in the three discs in this package is a great buy. It rounds out to less than ninety cents a film. The ten are described by Amazon above. Six of the ten are only about an hour in length, the longest of the six is 75 minutes, the remaining four are 89, 94, 103, and 104 minutes. One of the ten was produced in 1939, the one that is my favorite, about Mr. Moto, starring Peter Lorre.  Six are from the 1940s including my second favorite Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone, who many consider the best actor to play the role, as Sherlock. Two are from the 1950s and one, starring Peter O'Toole, is the only color film and is dated 1976.  Other actors in the films include Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, James Cagney, Glenn Ford, and Lloyd Bridges. This is a great collection.",1512259200,,784,4.326530612244898

8701807,2,B00THX0TMK,"I really like old movies and spy type movies.  That said, I did not much care for this collection, primarily because the transfer to DVD was not the greatest.  The images are not real sharp and the movies themselves do not have the best story lines.",1450137600,,249,4.391304347826087
8701808,5,B00THX0TMK,"Absolutely excellent collection of classic/black&white spy movies!

See some of your favorite actors from the Golden Age of Cinema in superbly told and shot stories of espionage!

I highly recommend this collection!

Just a few caveats ... the films are black&white, and there are no subtitles.  Also, a couple of the films are shaky.  (I thought about running the videos through one of my film editors to stabilize them, but it is not bad enough to take the time.)",1445126400,2,465,4.8354430379746836

8701810,5,B00THX0TMK,"I strongly recommend this three DVD set only for fans of: Boris Karloff or/and Robert Donat, or/and interesting spy movies made during WW2.  I am confident all 10 movies in the set can be viewed for free at youTube, but with much lower visual quality, which for me is very unsatisfying.
On the first DVD of the three I found the best quality edition I have yet to find for ""British Intelligence"" and I was pleasantly surprised just how good it is, as is it is entertaining for a Hollywood ""quickly"" B flick.  I was equally surprised by the video quality for ""The Adventures of Tartu"" found on the second DVD.  The last DVD I gave to my library.  The copy of ""British Intelligence"" will replace in my library an Alpha DVD, (with greatly inferior video quality), and the  copy of ""Tartu"" will be added to my library.  I would like to mention for a film made in Britain during the war ""Tartu"" adds to the good writing and acting rather good sets, especially of the chemical factory.  While not as bad as I expected for a set of 10 movies on 3 DVD's, none of the remaining 8 are of ""good"" quality and none were added to my library.  Aside from the Mr. Moto film in the set, (my favorite one of the series which I have in high quality from the 20th Century box set, Volume 2 so I did not even view the film on the first DVD of this set), I can not recommend any of the remaining films.  For me they are just not quite good enough to add to my library or/and the video quality left much to be desired.
Great price for two movies in perhaps the highest quality currently available on any disc.",1434931200,7,1586,4.2425249169435215
