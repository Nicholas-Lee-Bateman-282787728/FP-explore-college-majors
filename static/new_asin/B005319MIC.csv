8454929,5,B005319MIC,"Should anybody like their dramedy Korean, I just finished watching a movie called 'Going by the Book' and it was a very, very good time. While it is a light-hearted drama that starts with an innovative idea by the new Chief of Police who wants to stop a rash of bank robberies, there are moments of tension where everything might go very wrong. Jae-yeong Jeong, the leading man, reminds me of an Asian Michael Shannon with some Aspergers' characteristics. It's not one bit boring, the pacing is great and the chuckles are well-timed. You won't regret this one!",1375488000,,560,4.724489795918367

Here's the scoop. A new police chief has been assigned to a small-ish town in South Korea. He looks at it as a six month stepping stone to something better. Said town has experienced a string of bank robberies, so this chief is going to stage a phony bank robbery to quell the populace and show how well the police can respond. A problem arises when a traffic cop, given the role of the robber, fulfills the role better than anyone would have expected, and the whole thing blooms into a media circus. This traffic cop, as it turns out, was a detective who was demoted after trying to take down a corrupt official.

This is one nifty flick. It's clever, fresh and peppered with a whole bunch of great characters. The ""robber"" has done a good job thinking everything through and keeps the police on their toes. He has outsmarted them and causes them to actually think through the situation. He is somewhat weary and, though there is a lightness to the proceedings, a certain gravity develops as things progress. And, as the movie begins on a nice, crisp day, that turns into a rainy, dreary night, the viewer cannot help but wonder how this will all play out.

The characters, acting and directing are all great. It has a very interesting music score as well. The score alone lends a lot of personality to the film. There were certain aspects of the script that strain credulity, and there may have been too much concern in wrapping everything up at the end, but these are minor quibbles compared to the overall joy of watching this movie. Movies such as this just don't come around often enough.

This was released in 2007 and I'm surprised it hasn't already been remade in Hollywood. If you at all like Korean cinema, or merely clever plotting, this should be a fine night out for you.",1327881600,3,1851,4.5
8454931,5,B005319MIC,"I am rapidly becoming a fan of South Korean movies.

In this one, a (demoted) cop of a small city does his job strictly by the book; actually, he is a traffic cop in a deserted country intersection. Then, a newly appointed police chief arrives, openly disdainful of his surroundings and his subordinates and plans to be there only six months. In that city a string of bank robberies has taken place. The new police chief hits upon the idea of doing a training exercize simulating a bank robbery, with lots of publicity, wherein the ""robber"" would be caught by the police, thereby making the department look good. Just to make it interesting, there is no script; it's all going to be improvised. He chooses the demoted cop to play the ""robber"" and tells him to act his role convincingly. The problem immediately starts when the ""robber"" does just that and the troubles soon escalate to the point that the exercize attracts national attention. The movies is aided by a brilliant supporting cast.

Warning: the movie started out slowly, but once the robbery takes place my wife and I were laughing hysterically. There are also some cultural nuances that went over our head, but they were minor.",1325203200,,1191,4.748792270531401
8454932,4,B005319MIC,"Ran across this film by accident and decided on a whim to watch. It begins with a new police chief arriving in town, only to be ticketed for an illegal turn by Jung Do-man, an extremely ""by the book"" traffic cop. The chief is in the city to deal with a string of bank robberies, taking control of a police force that's just hoping that by spring the robbers will have moved out of their jurisdiction. Inspired by army maneuvers, the chief decides to hold a training that will reassure the populace that the police know exactly how to handle a robbery. For reasons that I'm still not completely clear on, he assigns Jung Do-man as the robber, telling him to do his best. Do-man applies his usual attention to detail to learning how to be a successful robber. When the training commences, everyone gets lessons they didn't expect. It's not as raucous as American humor, but I was totally engaged and amused watching. Jeong Jae-yeong (who played Jung Do-man) is definitely fun to watch. subtitled.",1323561600,,994,4.653409090909091
