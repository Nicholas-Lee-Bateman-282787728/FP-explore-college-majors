7479219,1,B016PGEUSK,"I love werewolf movies, so I had to watch this when I saw it on Netflix. I was nearly bored to death with the terrible acting coupled with junk dialogue, don't waste your money on this garbage- you want to see a good werewolf movie go watch dog soldiers.",1461024000,,254,4.204081632653061
7479220,4,B016PGEUSK,"This movie has some passably good acting and the story line is by far different than most. It's more than about a werewolf. There's plenty of filthy language, sexual commentary, friendship, and a tortured young man. All that blended together to make a good horror flick with an abundance of gore. The character studies were good enough to keep me from falling asleep. If you like this genre of movie, I think you'll like Uncaged.",1460505600,,429,4.733333333333333

7479224,3,B016PGEUSK,"I thought it was a cool take on the genre but at the same time, I don't feel like we got a full on werewolf in the movie, at times, while I appreciate practical effects over CGI, it looked a little on the poor side make-up wise. I've always been a believer that you can't make a werewolf movie if you can't have a convincing werewolf, and this does an OK job, but falls into pitfalls at times of lesser made werewolf films (cut aways, ""lights out"")
Otherwise it's a decent story and I like it a heck of a lot more than other recent werewolf movie offerings.",1457136000,,557,4.166666666666667

7479231,4,B016PGEUSK,"I'll keep this SHORT as there are, already, enough reviews.
The---low budget---movie was entertaining enough. My ONLY
negative comment is that IF you have a TV larger than 55"",
you'll notice that the werewolves have more Hallowe'en make
up applied than hair. A standout example is the grey makeup
on the noses instead of prosthetic appliances. That IS me in
my Amazon Profile Picture... I could've done a better job... I've
DONE better makeup jobs.",1455840000,3,448,4.986666666666666

7479236,3,B016PGEUSK,"OK, werewolf movie. I fast forwarded through a lot of the dialogue and story line. The acting was so-so but the whole story seemed drawn out and some parts seemed unneeded. I think if they would have made it into a short film it would have been better. The CGI was good and the gore was good, the gore was not over the top and left some parts to the imagination. Swearing, strong sexual language, the F bomb and male butt nudity through-out.",1455408000,,441,4.325301204819277
7479237,2,B016PGEUSK,"This movie is nothing but a low budget rip off of the movie Wolf starring Jack Nicholson, Michelle Phiefer ,and James Spader. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews than I did the positive ones. But since the good ones out numbered the bad, I went for it.  Big mistake! The other people who hated the movie probably just didn't think it was worth it to say anything since the DVD was not that expensive. Well, I'm saying something! Don't waste your money, this movie was awful! The good reviewers must have been high while watching this crap! I should have known something was up when they didn't offer it on Blu-ray too! SMDH! Oh well, lesson learned. If you want to see a real good Werewolf movie, might I suggest Wolf, it's older but it's a classic and good! Certainly well made and it has A list actors in it!",1454976000,4,832,4.402597402597403

7479239,4,B016PGEUSK,"This is one of the more unusual werewolf movies I've seen due mostly to a story that goes in unexpected directions. Example: The novice teen werewolf seeks out a witness to his previous night's killing spree to find out what she saw. And he ends up being bullied by her drug dealer husband, who believes the two were having a one night stand the night of the killing. So the predator suddenly becomes the prey. I couldn't stop watching cause it kept getting weirder. I liked it for that reason.",1454716800,4,494,4.5
7479240,3,B016PGEUSK,"Jack Luskey (Ben Getz) discovers he is a werewolf when he is 18, the hard way. It is a family thing. He goes to the cabin in the woods with his two friends, Brandon (Zack Weiner) a virginal geek and Turner (Kyle Kirkpatrick) your basic misogynist teen male.

Jack has no control when he turns into a werewolf several nights in a row. This makes for an awkward vacation.

The special effects are saved toward the end. There is only a little blood and gore. Plot and acting are okay for a ""B"" film. Film utilizes a few ""Creepshow"" style graphics. They drink Johnnie Walker Blue scotch...a nice touch.

Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, male butt nudity. Drawn nudity.",1454716800,5,657,4.5508474576271185
7479241,2,B016PGEUSK,"If you can get past the cheesy, sexually explicit dialogue which is written very much like a teen-age boy who can't keep his mind off his genitals, then you will discover bad acting and worse than 1980's special effects.  If you were surprised by the ending, then you haven't seen a good werewolf movie before.  A waste a time!",1454544000,4,327,4.52542372881356
7479242,5,B016PGEUSK,"I bought the DVD on the day of it's release and this is definitely one
of the more better werewolf films i've seen as of late. There's a bit
of everything suspense, horror, comedy, gore and action.

It's refreshing to see that this particular film doesn't just rely on
the beast itself to carry out everything. This is also a story driven
film which makes it all the more interesting to watch as everything
plays out.

The special effects of the werewolf transformation may not be top notch
Hollywood style but as a werewolf movie fan I applaud them for going
with practical effects and animatronics it brings out more creativity
and get's the actor involved instead of just having CGI do everything.

Definitely a talented cast everyone seemed invested and brought the
goods to the table.

Ben Getz (Grotto, Multi-Player) does a wonderful job carrying his first
full length film and if you buy the DVD (which I recommend because it
comes with a funny blooper reel and audio commentary with the cast and
crew) you'll find that not only is he talented but very dedicated to
his character as well especially during certain outside scenes. That's
something that will definitely work in his favor as an actor and I look
forward to seeing more of him in future roles.

Kyle Kirkpatrick, Zack Weiner (was hilarious throughout) and Paulina
Singer were strong standouts as well.

You'll find the title of this film is very fitting metaphorically
because the beast in Jack himself is ""Uncaged"" once he reaches a
certain age and literally because while Jack gets a cage with the
exception of one time he tends to transform before he's securely inside
which leads to some interesting things.

All in all i'd give this movie a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It's a decent
indie werewolf flick that's not like some of those thriller/horror
movies you watch one time then forget about a few weeks later. This one has nice rewatch value that you'll enjoy for many full moons to come.",1454457600,10,1961,4.699708454810495

8737056,1,B016PGEUSK,"This was one lousy werewolf movie, plain and simple.

The plot, some college freshmen, stay at some cottage/farmhouse, to bond(?). One is the werewolf, one is the McLovin-wanna-be, and the third is the ladies man (really poor casting choices) Once they are there, the wolf boy, keeps waking up outside naked. The ladies man, who straps a Go-Pro to his head (ladies love this) every time he gets intimate with a woman, goes about meeting women from an app. The nerd just decides to get high. Once the wolf boy realizes he is a wolf, he straps the Go-Pro to his head to see what happens after he transforms. Meanwhile, the ladies man kills the wolf boy's mother, by accident, then just buries the body in the yard, and nothing happens with this until the end. The wolf boy videotapes himself ripping a guy in half at a train station. We never actually see him as the wolf, but it looks along the lines of Teen Wolf, with even less fur.

The victim at the train station, was with a surviving woman, who apparently is the wife of a bad-ass (but with splendid manors) drug dealer (?) named Gonzo (apparently a big muppets fan). Wolf boy tracks this woman down, to find out what she saw. Gonzo wants to find out if his wife was cheating on him. By the way, Gonzo treats his wife like crap, so why does he even care?

The nerd now realizes wolfboy is a wolf, and then proceeds to act McLovin-like with him. Attempts at comical dialogue, ""I don't want to die. I mean I would die for you. But I don't want you to like, eat me. I would sacrifice myself for you, but that's different"". HILARIOUS. Wolfboy and nerd, find a cage that was left for wolfboy and he locks himself in at night, or at least wants to for the next 5 nights. Ladies man, finally realizes something is up, but refuses to lock wolfboy in the cage, thinking wolfboy is just a serial killer. Wolfboy transforms, then proceeds to scratch ladies man on the leg. Any other werewolf, or zombie movie for that matter, when you get bit/scratched, you eventually turn into a werewolf/zombie, but ladies man thinks nothing of it.

Long story short, a few more people get killed, we finally see a coupe of wolf transformations which basically looked WORSE than Teen-Wolf changes, we get more crappy dialogue, then a lame ending. The End.

Don't waste money here. Don't even watch it on cable. Just find a better werewolf movie.",1478131200,,2375,4.488425925925926

8737059,4,B016PGEUSK,"Ok I enjoyed this WOLFMAN look..movie. The crazy cousin cracked me up. The twisted story was cool. But seeing so many and owning so many WEREWOLF movies, I pretty much guessed how it was going. Little bit of howling, wolves, and some of Jack Nicholson 's WOLF ( 1994)  scenes thrown in here. Yes the writers were creative the first half of the movie, but lost it in the last 30 mins. Oh it enjoyable to toung werewolf fans but if your 40 plus in age.. You may have read or seen something's in this movie somewhere else. WORTH A watch.",1464652800,,534,4.287128712871287
8737060,1,B016PGEUSK,This movie could ruin it for all werewolf films to come. How anyone could give this movie more than 2 stars much less 5 is beyond me. Friends go camping; one of them wakes up in the morning outside and naked. He has no idea how he got there. Boy wakes up again later on - same situation. Boy is a werewolf but doesn't know it.  Friend of boy also turns into a werewolf later on but didn't know that he was a werewolf. Mayhem follows. What else would one expect? I won't say any more because I don't want to be a Spoiler - hah!  Just be careful that you don't turn into a werewolf while watching this movie because you bought it.,1462147200,,628,4.056451612903226
8737061,1,B016PGEUSK,"OMG!--director Daniel Robbins must have a lot of friends writing reviews for UNCAGED. Maybe it is about time someone outside his entourage wrote something about this time waster. The story offers nothing new. No fresh takes. Not scary in the least or suspenseful. The pacing of UNCAGED is lethargic. I probably spent more than half the movie with my finger on the fast forward button. The caricatures--.errr, I mean characters--consist largely of teens with nothing but sex on their minds. The werewolf FX would be good at your local Halloween haunted house attraction, but the clean neck variety are pretty laughable on the movie/TV screen. One of the other reviewers mentioned some good funny moments. Here's one early in the film: the main characters are at a drunken teen party. When one of them heads to the bathroom, he sees a girl throwing up in the toilet. Another guy comes in and throws up on the girl's head. If that is funny to you, then this is your movie. Me, I was glad I didn't spend more than thirty-something minutes on this shoddy film. Your time would be better spent staring at the keepcase, which has pretty decent artwork.

If you have your heart set on a good werewolf movie, try HOWL or LATE PHASES: NIGHT OF THE LONE WOLF. WHEN ANIMALS DREAM also looks promising. There are also some very good older movies, too, and it is easy enough to research them--thanks to the internet. So do yourself a favor and find something better to watch. It's not that hard.",1461456000,2,1481,4.674329501915709
