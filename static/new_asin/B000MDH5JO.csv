2728311,5,B000MDH5JO,"If you are going to buy one excerise DVD, this is the one. Paired with 30 minutes of your favorite outdoor cardio (walking, runnng, biking, whatever..)this dvd provides a long or quick weights & toning workout. I LOVE IT. Isn't cheesy AT ALL...just the perfect amount of time for each segment. A+++",1183680000,17,298,4.75
2728312,5,B000MDH5JO,"I saw Minna Lessig on TV promoting this DVD, and after watching a few of the exercises, I decided to try it. I have tried many DVDs like pilates and taebo, and this was by far the best and most fun. You can do arms one day, abs the next, followed by bottom, or you can do a whole body workout. I like it because I can do a whole body workout followed by just abs or any combination that I feel is right for the day. She is also very motivating through the whole workout. The whole body workout is only 15 minutes long, but I was sweating by the end!!I would recommend this DVD to anyone who doesn't want to work out at a gym.",1180396800,22,625,3.9291338582677167
2728313,5,B000MDH5JO,"This is my 4th dvd featuring Minna Lessig. I think she plans very balanced programs that hit all of the areas. This dvd has sections for arms & shoulders, abs, and glutes plus an additional 15 minutes segment for total body conditioning. All segments are challenging and include some moves that are new to me. You need two sets of weights (light & heavy) and a mat. I've been working out regularly for a while, so I used 5 and 8 pound weights. If you are just starting out, go lighter.

Minna demonstrates moves well and is very encouraging - never annoying. This dvd will be a regular in the rotation for quite a while.",1179619200,97,620,4.391304347826087
2728314,4,B000MDH5JO,"This is a fun fast paced, intermediate body toning and sculpting video.  The moves can be challenging, but once you get the hang of it your good to go.  The instructor shows you the move first, and then you follow along with her.  She does different moves to work the same body part in different ways.  This keeps the work out fun and interesting.  The music is great.  You will love this toning workout.  I built up a lot of sweat just doing the sculpting routines and I bet you will too.  This is a keeper.  You can also turn of the speaking and just do the workout or create your own workout to the music only.",1177372800,31,613,4.170940170940171
2728315,4,B000MDH5JO,"I bought this dvd 2 weeks ago and have done it 3 times now and really enjoy it. I was also very sore which, of course, is a good thing. Minna knows how to make working out fun. She does a very good job hitting every body part. In my opinion, an excellent workout for intermediates. I never dread doing this workout because Minna makes it fun. Often, I don't work out because I dread it, but this one is fun.",1177027200,13,407,4.037037037037037
2728316,4,B000MDH5JO,"This is my second DVD of Minna's and it's good, but not as good as other workouts by other instructors.  It is fun, and she is a great instructor, but there's something about this that isn't as good as others out there.

It's an intermediate workout for your whole body.  There are four sections and each focus on a different section.  There is a segment for abs, upper body and butt, and the fourth section is your whole body.  There are the usual type of moves here, nothing too new, but in each segment there are two intensity levels depending on how fit you are or how hard you want to train.  There is a fast paced and a slower version using more controlled movement.  All you need is some dumbells and you are good to go.  Minna is an outgoing and friendly instructor with no frills.  I like this and it's good to do once or twice a week along with a real favourite of yours.",1176336000,52,881,4.227544910179641
2728317,5,B000MDH5JO,I love this video works all the areas that I struggle with.  The incredible thing is that I received all three videos for less than $30. The best deal and the best workout ever. Very pleased!!!!!,1437350400,,195,4.416666666666667

2728322,1,B000MDH5JO,I wanted an exercise DVD that would get rid of chicken arms. This DVD concentrates on shoulders. If I can't show my arms how can I get to my shoulders?,1428192000,2,151,4.066666666666666
2728323,2,B000MDH5JO,"Disappointing - very beginner level - the arms section is the best one, but I'm still sorry I ordered it.  I really like Minna's fun & encouraging style, but I was expecting more challenge that would make me feel (& see) that I've done more work.  For abs & legs, I recommend Jeanette Jenkins' Ab Blast + Butt/thigh Blast.  Still searching for a really great arm workout.",1425168000,3,371,4.507462686567164
2728324,4,B000MDH5JO,"This DVD actually is one of the better that I have gotten before goes right into the routine vs others that you have to choose a million screens before you can even do the routine. Could use some longer reps though ,could be longer and be more up to date on music side.",1421798400,,269,4.09433962264151

2728327,5,B000MDH5JO,"I really love this workout dvd.  I am presently 4 months postpartum and although the weight is slowing coming off....9 months of pregnancy left my muscular tone more than a little lacking.  With this workout dvd you can choose a segment devoted one particular body part: arms, belly, or bottom....or an overall conditioning.  When I have the time I enjoy working out to all of the segments, which is a little over an hour.  But if I only have 20 minutes that is fine because I can just do one of the smaller workouts.  All you need is a couple of set of hand weights, or if in a crunch just one set, and a work out mat...if you have one, if not, carpet is fine.

DVD arrived in time and in great shape!",1415491200,4,702,4.201492537313433

2728334,2,B000MDH5JO,this is a borring work out video. In fact I feel guilty giving it away because I know it will just clutter someone else's shelf.,1404950400,,128,4.16
2728335,3,B000MDH5JO,"The arm section is ok but too easy and not long enough.
The ab section is terrible - very little ab work.
The bottom section is equally not very good.
There is no flow from one exercise to the next.  A lot of going back and forth to floor from standing.
The instructor appears to be a former gymnast/cheerleader and not college educated in physical exercise.
Basically, it is sort of silly, unless you are a beginner or you don't want to work very hard.
I doubt that anyone will change their figure with this DVD unless they are very overweight.",1400976000,2,545,4.396039603960396
2728336,5,B000MDH5JO,This is a nice low key work out. If you don't want hi-impact this is the work out for you. I can feel the burn with the exercises without pounding the knees and ankles.,1399161600,2,168,3.9705882352941178

2728339,4,B000MDH5JO,"I work out every day, so the fact that the first day I did this, it kicked my butt really threw me for a loop. It's got some classic forms and some new, fun ones. She starts out basic and slowly adds on to make it more difficult as you go, warming up to the harder aspects. It also helped me understand some of the other videos I've used. I used this every other day for a week (for a total of four times), and while I did not lose weight, I did lose inches, which was really rewarding. Would definitely recommend trying it out.",1396137600,,528,4.038095238095238
2728340,5,B000MDH5JO,Minna is such a great instructor and I wish she would release some new workouts! this is a hidden gem of a workout.,1393027200,,115,4.043478260869565
2728341,5,B000MDH5JO,"It was a little difficult for me to believe the reviews I was reading, but a friend highly recommended this DVD for me to try - and I am SO happy I did! All you need is like 15, 20 minutes a day (half hour if you want to do the whole body). You don't really feel it while you're doing the work outs, but the day after I already felt and saw some results - although this may not be typical for everybody, as my body fluctuates easily. But I guarantee, if you do this DVD once a day, you WILL see and feel the results within a week! Totally worth buying.",1392768000,7,552,3.893805309734513

2728343,5,B000MDH5JO,"Minna Lessig is a former body builder who has developed a workable, fun exercise program for those of us who desire a better version of our own body, not something that requires half a day at the gym every day.  Minna targets each of the 3 areas - tank top arms, bikini belly and boy shorts bottom - for 15 minutes and then follows that with an optional 15 minute  program designed to improve all 3 areas in a total of an hour per day.  This is a program that works for me and accomplishes more in less time than going to a gym, which takes at least 1 1/2 hours if you include the travel time.  I must admit that the title for the ""boy shorts bottom"" segment is out-of-date.  If she produced the video today, no doubt she would call it ""booty shorts bottom.""",1390953600,,758,4.164383561643835
2728344,5,B000MDH5JO,"I love this workout DVD.  Following it has visibly toned my arms (I use 5 lb. weights).  It is just challenging enough, but not too crazy that it's discouraging.  I also like Mina's attitude.  She motivates by making workouts fun and interesting.  She is definitely refreshing when compared to Jillian Michaels' boring high school gym class style workouts while calling everyone ""Buddy.""  My daily routine usually consists of a session of my Wii compatible Zumba disc and one of the workouts from this DVD.  By far, my favorite is the arm workout.

Highly recommend!!!",1387670400,,568,4.968085106382978
2728345,5,B000MDH5JO,"Did the arms and bottom workouts only once and I didn't think that these 'short' workouts would do anything. But, I did feel the effects the next day....so yes, these workouts will work.",1383955200,3,186,4.666666666666667
2728346,5,B000MDH5JO,I loved the workouts in this DVD.  Quick and not too stressful for my joints.  Love the diversity in the exercise choices. Minna is awesome!!  I am starting to see some difference in my arms!!,1358899200,,192,4.428571428571429
2728347,5,B000MDH5JO,"This DVD is easy to follow and offers a variety of exercises to work common ""trouble spots"".  Instructor Minna Lessig is likeable--upbeat without being cheesy or annoyingly perky--and I liked that she demonstrates the exercises before you do them.

This workout is challenging--especially if your arms are weenie like mine, but has a beginner modification if you need it.  I even broke a sweat during the ab workout--each section focuses on specific body parts, but the moves are multipurpose and your whole body gets worked. You WILL get fit doing this workout.  The only thing I didn't care for was the music--it's not great, but not distractingly bad either.  I've done a lot of exercise DVDs, and this is definitely one of the better ones.",1357603200,,743,4.912
2728348,5,B000MDH5JO,"I've been a runner for decades, so the only problem area for me has been arms.  This DVD is great for toning arms, but it's a bit easy, so I repeat the arm sequence at least once and try to use heavier weights.  On some days I use ""Ageless with Kathy Smith"" (for arms only) and between these two DVDs, I see improvement in my arms over the past 2 months--and expect the results to continue.  Minna Lessig is a terrific instructor.",1310428800,,430,4.219512195121951
2728349,5,B000MDH5JO,"I had to buy this one after getting it from my library and doing one of the segments each day that I had it checked out til I had to return it. I LOVE Minna. She has just enough energy without being over the top. I like how it is broken into segments, so that if you just want to do one, you can. The music is perfect too. It is nothing crazy, but it doesn't put you to sleep either.",1298937600,2,383,3.740740740740741
2728350,5,B000MDH5JO,"Generally I work out at home using DVDs from netflix.  I received Tank Top Arms, Bikini Belly, Boy Shorts Bottom from Netflix and proceeded to keep it for four weeks. It is good, kids.  I did the DVD three or four times a week and felt stronger, sleeker and sexier.

I definitely recommend it for ladies with an event to prep for.  Minna is a fantastic teacher.  She demonstrates the move first and then has you start a great set.  I never feel like I am rushing to keep up and feel challenged by the workout.  Really feels good to get strong.",1287446400,2,543,4.264705882352941
2728351,5,B000MDH5JO,"I love this workout! There is a warm up and a cool down, an ab workout, a butt workout and an arms workout. Plus a full body workout. Each workout can be accessed seperately or you can play them all. Doing them all takes about an hour.

2728353,5,B000MDH5JO,"I got this DVD after starting a personal training program - to do on the days that I don't have appointments with the trainers. And let me tell you, it kicks my butt!
I am just getting back into working out again (took about 8 yrs off due to knee problems and general life laziness..ugh..)but am happy to have found this to add to the rotation.  It's great because I can do just about everything in here now, and there's plenty of room for me to 'grow' (or shrink!) into the rest of the dvd. There are alot of variations and you can make exercises harder/easier without much thought.  Overall I think this is a GREAT DVD and HAVE already recommended it to a few friends!",1267056000,3,670,4.309523809523809
2728354,5,B000MDH5JO,"I love the instructor, she is adorable.  The workout is a good one.  Lots of chapters in the DVD to allow you to do a short workout for just one body part or a long full body one.  It is one of my favorites.",1253318400,2,207,3.659090909090909
2728355,1,B000MDH5JO,I did not feel anything in the abs portion of this at all. arm part is OK. If you want great ABS Tamilee Webb. All over body all parts-try Cindy Whitmarsh. I bought this cause i needed something quick to take on vaca with me. It really is the worst exercise DVD I ever did.,1247443200,6,273,3.981818181818182

This is my first experience with this trainer and I find her positive and upbeat. Even when I start to think about giving up, I feel like she knows just what to say such as, ""I know you're probably hurting right now, but focus on that tank top you want to fit into, ok?"" Just what I need this summer - just wish I'd found it sooner! :)",1247184000,2,478,4.042105263157895
2728357,5,B000MDH5JO,"I really LOVE LOVE LOVE this fitness dvd. Minna is an amazing instructor. I liked all of the exercise moves, how she divides up each section of her type based on what part of your body you wanna work on, and how she's genuinely encouraging without being cheesy. There are no Mickey Mouse exercises so you gotta bring your A game but she does a great job at making the time fly by so you can complete her workout because its super fun! I loved the music and the modifications throughout the workout as well. I don't understand the negative reviews at all. Minna gets you results! Love her!",1237939200,3,588,4.4036697247706424
2728358,5,B000MDH5JO,"I have tried many other workout DVD's and this one is the best by far!  I've been using this DVD for nearly 2 years, and I still use it regularly and love it.  The exercises seem a little challenging when you first start, especially if you're not used to working out or if you haven't worked out in a while, but once you start to include them into your weekly routine, they definitely become easier, but still not without a challenge.  I started out using it 3 times a week in the beginning just doing the segments on the Warm Up, Abs and Bottom and I can honestly say that the results were awesome... I've gotten plenty of compliments to prove it!  Now I just use it 1-2 times a week and that's all I need.  I would recommend it to anyone!",1237248000,3,740,4.183098591549296
2728359,5,B000MDH5JO,"I bought this DVD because I have her book of the same name,  plus, many others users rated it quite highly. One thing I find is that when you are doing different DVD workouts, it's good to have a rotation. She has a lot of similar moves but there are a few that are quite different which was a nice surprise. I think there were about 6 different moves in the abs section, I thought there could be more though. That was the only disappointment. Having said that, I still couldn't do all of them! I do have other DVD's just for the abs, so I guess all is not lost. I was sore the first few times but it makes a nice change. She is engaging and easy to follow. Not too ""cheerleader"" but just enough to get you moving.",1237075200,,714,4.0638297872340425

What I don't like is with a lot of the exercises, it is very possible to look like you are doing it right but not actually get any of the benefit (form really matters). I think this workout would be really great if done in a class or with a personal trainer, but on a DVD it doesn't work so well. I have only done it a few times though- I bet if you stick it out and try really hard to follow her, you will get good results.",1234396800,,498,3.7523809523809524

I've been concentrating mostly on the arms and legs, and I feel that I am getting a workout that will definitely help me achieve what I want.  Each section is about 15 minutes long.  You can break it up if your time is limited. This workout is not easy, but it is doable.  I have found that I must have a lot of patience with myself.  She does some unique exercises like the ""froggy"" (Bottoms section).  This is something I look for in my selection of exercise DVDs.  I hate to buy something that every other instructor is using.  She gives excellent instructions, and her cuing is right on the mark.  If you buy this DVD, don't give up if it is too hard for your level; just stick with it and you will find that you can do this; just have some confidence in yourself.  I do feel that the ""Bikini Belly"" section is the hardest, but abs are not my favorite anyway.  If you buy the DVD, don't buy the book.  The book is 99% pictures of the exercises. You really don't need both. Buy the DVD. I think that you will be very happy in your selection.  I know that I am.",1210809600,2,1106,4.160377358490566

However, I think that muting her would prevent you from getting the full benefit from the workout because Minna seems to know just the right times to motivate you, and correct you. She walks you through every move in a way that you can understand, and picks up the pace once you've gotten the hang of it. What I also liked about this DVD was that the woman on the right side of Minna is the one who performs all of the beginner modifications. If a move is too challenging, just shift your attention to Jessica and do what she is doing. Overall, this is a great DVD, and you can benefit a lot from buying it.",1206921600,4,1011,4.137055837563452
2728371,3,B000MDH5JO,"I like Minna Lessig as an instructor and i've enjoyed her other DVD's. This one just wasn't her best work mostly because there wasn't a consistent flow (floor then standing then floor again sort of thing) . Overall, it was a fair workout with the exception of the abs section that has yet to leave me feeling like the abs were worked at all.",1206230400,2,341,4.34375
2728372,5,B000MDH5JO,"The workouts in this DVD and simple and easy to do.  You might not find new moves, but the combination of them and then separated into upper body, abs, and lower body as well as total body makes for a diverse collection.  I will say that I got the combination of the DVD and book.  I really just wanted the DVD, but I am very glad that I got the book.  There are a few moves not included in the DVD and the book has very well laid out workouts and schedules for those who are new or lazy (like me) to organize a workout program.  I'm an occupational therapist and know most of these exercises (particularly the arms), but I'm too lazy to make up a program.  I really enjoyed Minna's energy (without being condescending) as well as her attention to form and stretching.  I highly recommend this DVD and book for a beginner or intermediate exerciser.  Good luck on your quest on being fit and healthy!!",1205020800,2,900,4.315476190476191

2728374,5,B000MDH5JO,"I ordered a bunch of DVD workouts 5 weeks before my wedding.  By far, Minna's workout is the best.  Her instructions are clear.  In fact, the types of ""moves"" she uses do not really need instruction.  Watch her do it once and you are set to go.  I really wanted something FAST, EASY and to give me A GREAT workout.  This DVD is it!  After two weeks at 3 times a week, doing each workout each time, I have fantastic results. Within in a week, I noticed a definite increase in muscle tone.  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG BUYING THIS DVD WORKOUT!!!!",1201737600,5,536,4.237623762376238
2728375,4,B000MDH5JO,"Lessig came highly recommended from another reviewer, and I was not disappointed.  She does a nice warm-up and spot reducing segments follow.  I had some problems with the pushups but figured out to modify them by doing only a slight press.

The workouts move smoothly from exercise to exercise.  Lessig is perky and encouraging without being saccharine. I would call these workouts an intermediate intensity workout.",1200355200,2,417,5.2727272727272725
2728376,2,B000MDH5JO,"Okay so I give a workout several chances before I make up my mind. I was excited about this one after reading the reviews here. Clearly people like it, so it could be me.  I work out an hour a day to a video, usually taebo or the firm (allison davis) or pilates (ana caban), and I am thin and do well aerobically but lack strength so I thought the toning from this video would do the trick. Here are my issues with it.
What I was hoping for were challenging, simple, streamlined movements that worked my muscles. What I feel the video provides are awkward poses that focus more on forcing the body to do something strange or unnatural, for example, the ""ballerina abs"" pose- you are seated with your legs straight out in front of you, then with your arms at your sides you press down with your hands to lift up your butt. I just felt like my arms weren't long enough (and I don't have short arms!) to be able to do the move and that most of the stress was in my wrists once I did get some levity, and it was intended as an ab exercise. That is the overall feeling I get from the workout, that it is all going into my joints and bones and not my muscles. And I am 24 and quite flexible so I don't understand it.
I also felt there was not a natural rythym from one move to the next, it felt disjointed and there is a lot of wasted, idle time. At the end of the workout my muscles are not fatigued (and they should be I am a beginner to strength exercise) and feel like nothing was accomplished and my time was wasted. The very few effective exercises are not enough for me to justify its regular use. It now sits on the shelf forever.
I am honestly baffled by the good reviews everyone else has given this video. This video frustrates me way too much. More importantly, I found it ineffective.
I gave it two stars, not one, because it isn't the worst video out there- the production is fine, it is easy to keep up with, the instructor isn't horrible.",1195862400,113,1948,4.16710875331565
2728377,4,B000MDH5JO,"This is not the first Minna Lessig DVD I've owned. Minna's cueing is precise, explanation and demonstration of each move clear. She knows how to make you feel the challenge of the reps and what each move will do for your body.",1193875200,,226,4.404761904761905
2728378,5,B000MDH5JO,"i am a big fan of workout dvds, especially for toning. as a mother of three, and wife, it is great to be able squeeze in a workout of this magnitude w/my busy schedule. the moves are great because they are different from all the other workouts, which keeps you from getting bored.
thanks minna!!",1191542400,2,295,4.381818181818182
2728379,5,B000MDH5JO,"This video was my introduction to Minna Lessig, and a surprisingly pleasant one at that. The set is warm and colorful, and the music is very understated, motivating, and, well, nice. Minna, who herself is upbeat and encouraging without being goofy, provides the ultimate motivation to stick with the workout: the perfect female form! That's reason enough for me to spend a little cash on this one, but I'll continue for the sake of those who aren't convinced. ;)

This video features four well-organized ""circuits"": one for the arms and upper body, one for the midsection, one for the glutes and lower body, and one for the total body. The video also has separate warm-ups and cool-downs, which is a plus if you tend to mix and match segments (you can insert them appropriately at the beginning or end of your entire workout instead of having to do integrated warm-ups and cool-downs in each circuit). The exercises, while many of them build on familiar moves (e.g. pushups, crunches, lunges), are very much varied. I expected the total body workout to be a mish-mash of the previous three, but to my surprise, even it offered novel moves.

As a slight note of caution, several of these moves are very challenging, particularly if you are not an experienced exerciser. However, modifications are shown, and the exercises (assuming you're able to perform them) will certainly be effective. I love the fact that there are stretches, which are essential to keep the muscles ""long and lean"" and maintain flexibility, after every exercise. Minna's cuing is impeccable, and all of the exercises are initially done slowly to allow viewers to become comfortable with the movements. She talks only enough to coach you through the exercises. I, for one, appreciate the silences between reps; I can count myself!

I did dislike the ""raise-the-roof"" bit in the arms circuit, which was personally my least favorite one. It didn't ruin the overall tone of the video by any means, but I was certainly tired of ""imagining my tank top"" by the end of the segment. I was also disappointed in the lack of oblique moves in the abs circuit. However, the total body circuit definitely added some great new moves to my repertoire, and I can't wait to integrate the video into my routine!",1190937600,15,2263,4.857512953367876
2728380,5,B000MDH5JO,"I am getting married in April and I wanted to really kick it in high gear! This DVD has been so great! The DVD is set up into three individualized circuits for the body. I usually do one or two circuits a day along with the ""Total Body Toning Circuit"" at the end. I have never felt so good while I was doing a workout! I smile the whole time and the instructor, Minna, gives great instructions! If you are looking for an excellent work out, this is one that truly delilvers!",1189555200,2,474,4.163043478260869

In the past month, I have done this video faithfully 3x a week. And I like the results! None of the workout moves seem impossible, and in a way, after doing them a while, they almost seem to easy, but I am still seeing results (I just increased my weights). I would recommend this video for anyone who wants to spend 15-20 minutes on any of the areas, and see results! I only have one complaint... I wish her arm workout had more for the triceps!",1186617600,9,563,4.174311926605505

It includes some interesting plank exercises that are challenging and yet very do-able.  I like the music and the instructor is very pleasant.  Throughout the program, core is being tightened.  I've been regularly exercising for the last 15 years and I always search for fun and effective exercise programs that I can do at the home gym.
