7758918,5,B01G8S3I4C,"A magnificent film set in Koreas colonial era of occupation by the Japanese. Everything from the cinematography, storyline, CGI of the tiger, and the characters are nearly perfect. Choi Min-Sik comes through perfectly as the aged and wise hunter. I read one reviewer who disliked the film because many of the characters, in situations of extreme emotion, shed tears. I feel so sorry for the individual  who looks down on a man crying. It's evident he knows little about Korean culture, the bonds of friendship, situations of extreme fear in the face of death, and the love of ones child.  This is a film I will re-watch many times to come.",1474416000,3,639,4.747747747747748
7758919,4,B01G8S3I4C,Great story line.  Moral about hunting a species to extinction.,1473465600,2,63,5.3
7758920,3,B01G8S3I4C,"The Tiger stars Choi Min-sik (Oldboy, Roaring Currents) as Chun Man-duk, a hunter in early 20th-century Korea, during the Japanese colonial period, whos training his son to follow in his footsteps. The Japanese have set about killing every native Korean animal they can find on orders from a bloodthirsty commander. Along with other hunters, Chun is charged by the commander to hunt down the last remaining tiger on the Jirisan Peninsula. The almost mythical beast of the title seems able to differentiate between nationalities. Though he mauls whomever comes in his path, its the Japanese oppressors who receive his most savage attacks.

The CGI tiger is quite realistic, reminiscent of the incredibly real tiger in Life of Pi. Like monster movies of the 1950s, the tiger is seen fleetingly at first until its full form is dramatically revealed. Also rendered with computer artistry are wolves and tiger cubs. Cinematographer Lee Mo-gae provides some lovely images of the areas natural beauty, but its the action sequences that are the films strength, with the struggle taking on an epic quality.

The unrated widescreen Blu-ray release contains no bonus features. The film is in Korean, with English subtitles.",1471564800,2,1212,5.21025641025641
7758921,4,B01G8S3I4C,"I just now I'm finishing this movie up and to a lot of you probably want feel like me it's subtle but it's base on a true story. Heartaches , love and legend and one more thing. I like action movies. But to me it's a most see. One of the actors is the star of the movie the Last Samurai and I'm not talking about Tom :)",1471132800,,319,3.7058823529411766

7758923,5,B01G8S3I4C,"Starts off a bit slow, but that's probably due to cultural differences.  But I've seen this actor, Choi Min-Sik in quite a few movies, and he never fails to raise my admiration for his acting skills.  This movie has its share of gore, but the underlying story, from the father's (hunter) side Choi Min-Sik, and even that of the hunted will keep your undivided attention.  I'd bet right now, you'll watch this one more than once.  I watched it twice in a row, then watched the last half three more times.",1507852800,2,503,4.4945054945054945
7758924,5,B01G8S3I4C,"Choi Min Sik never disappoints! How he can make every single role seem to be tailor-made just for him is the truest talent. This time he became the tiger. He's working some serious Spirit Animal mojo.

Korea has done it yet again with another spectacular, terrifying, and heart-squeezing tale.  ""The Tiger,"" aka ""The Tiger: An Old Hunter's Tale,"" and ""Daeho"" or  in Korean won several awards in Korea in 2016.

I read a few comments before watching the movie amd I'm glad to see that people across the globe are recognizing Korea's film making as top notch.",1506384000,,557,4.711340206185567

This is a sad realistic movie that has a fantastic story line and amazing special effects. I don't want to give away too much but pass it by because I said it was sad.

I was expecting a run of the mill sort of hunter vs. maneating beast movie and instead I got a sweeping epic topped with probably 100+ (maybe SLIGHTLY exaggerated) tiger maulings. This wasn't a 'realistic' film like I expected, more fantasy-esque. But I highly recommend it.",1483747200,,300,4.901960784313726

7758953,5,B01G8S3I4C,"Just watched this movie on Netflix. It was so good, I'm actually buying it on Bluray to watch it again and again from time to time.

Don't listen to the snobs and nay Sayers who probably thinks only Hollywood makes great movies and everyone else's is sub standard. These people need to get out more often from their little world, travel far and wide to appreciate the many myriad of cultures around the globe. Or read books about other societies at the least.

All in all, a wonderful movie that reflects the best and worst of the human animal. It'll keep you guessing till the end. A definite classic!!!",1479513600,2,604,4.532110091743119

7758958,3,B01G8S3I4C,"We really wanted to like this Korean language movie, which includes English subtitles.  The basic premise sounds interesting.  Japanese occupiers of Korea direct the slaughter of a Siberian tiger, and the fight ends up being between a Korean hunter and a highly intelligent tiger.  The execution, on the other hand, ends up having tigers behave in an un-tiger fashion, and the movie is mostly boring.

Chun Man-Duk is a skilled hunter with an established reputation.  After accidentally killing his wife, Man-Duk stops hunting and gathers herbs from Mount Jirisan.  Life likely would have been good for everyone but for Man-Duk's son Seok, who hopes to kill a tiger to gain the approval of a girlfriend's family for marriage.  When an encounter between dozens of hunters, including Seok, ends badly, Man-Duk decides the time has come for a showdown between the two great hunters, himself and the tiger.

The one thing that this movie has going for it is the landscape.  South Korea contains some of the most beautiful mountains in the world, and they are used effectively as backdrops in this movie.  Even Chun Man-Duk is portrayed well and interestingly.  Pretty much everything else about this movie has issues.

First, the entire storyline about Seok is predictable, being one of those things you can see coming from a mile away.  The predictability of that plotline is forgivable, but then there is the near caricature of the Japanese.  Korean movies often use one of two catchall tropes, Japanese are uniformly bad in all historical movies (which, given the history of the brutal Japanese occupation in Korea, is understandable), and the United States is responsible for all things that are bad in current South Korea.  In this movie, it is the former.  Unfortunately, we have seen so many Korean movies where the Japanese are bad and/or evil that it is a worn out stereotype.

Worst of all is the behavior of the tigers.  The tigers behave not as actual Siberian tigers, but as we would expect people to behave.  An inevitable comparison is between this movie and ""Jaws.""  In ""Jaws,"" the shark mostly behaved as sharks do, except for the propensity to snack on people, which is extremely uncharacteristic for sharks, and the apparent need to attack the Orca at the end of the movie.  Still, the shark was a single-minded eating machine, with no forgiveness and only one goal, to eat.  The tigers in this movie, on the other hand, were shown being merciful, being aggressive toward dozens of people in a group, and apparently a nurturing scene with both male and female tigers caring for cubs (ummm, no).  Combine the terribly un-tiger-like behavior with CGI, and the tigers are just not believable.

To cap it all off, the end of the movie was also predictable.  We were hoping for some sort of shocker or revelation, but the movie end was about as depressing as a Shakespearean tragedy where nearly everyone dies, and the only ones who leave the field of battle are the Japanese occupiers.

We are probably being too generous with three stars, but the scenery is great, some of the special effects are suitably gory, and the movie tried really hard to do something, though we are not quite sure what.  This movie will make you want to watch ""Jaws"" again just to remember what a good movie of man vs. wild beast should be.

Good luck!",1477872000,,3340,4.822495606326889

7758960,3,B01G8S3I4C,"I love the idea for this story. I've been fascinated by the folklore as well as the history of tigers ever since reading John Vaillant's book, The Tiger, and I thought that this would be a variation on that theme. The film is beautiful -- some of the most evocative cinematography I've ever seen. Performances are great. But the movie suffers a little from the CGI. Am I the only one who doesn't find the tiger realistic at all? I can excuse the anthropomorphic qualities (as one reviewer pointed out, tigers don't really act that way) -- this is supposed to be a fantastic story. But sometimes the violence just gets a little silly. It didn't need to be that way.

Still worth a look -- the final shot stays with you.",1475798400,,718,4.4393939393939394

7758963,1,B01G8S3I4C,"Potentially interesting story, some moments of cinematography are OK, but not great. The real issue I have is with the tiger. The writers completely ignored how tigers behave in order to create human sentimentality. Tigers are not sentimental. I think this ruins the story, and the tendency for the director to over-sentimentalize every event repeatedly, drawing out the film until you lose interest. A film that tries to evoke emotions over and over again numbs the audience. We don't need 30 minutes of tragic screaming and bawling at the death of every character in the film.",1474848000,2,578,5.03125
