554182,1,6303081096,IT'S LIKE A COLLEGE ESSAY/PAPER AND QUITE BORING!  MANY PICTURES ARE CLIPPED FROM THE OLD MOVIES THAT YOU CAN FIND - NOT MUCH ROCK'S PERSONAL LIFE. AND I DO NOT LIKE THE JOKES IN THE BONUS.  ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ENTERTAINMENT!,1176854400,6,254,4.622222222222222
554183,1,6303081096,"This was the longest hour watching a movie that I've spent in a long time. First, it's not really home movies at all, but cuts from Rock's movies that he is presumed to have shown at home to his friends. There is a guy who plays Rock speaking in the first person, but this obvious fiction is set in a documentary style as if it all really happened. That seems unlikely -- I can't imagine Rock himself was ever this boring. You'd be much better off watching Rock's real movies and inferring the gay content for yourself. Save yourself an hour and skip this one.",1133136000,35,560,4.3428571428571425
554184,3,6303081096,"This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively. The title refers to the reel of gay and homoerotic scenes from Hudson's studio films that he compiled for showing to his friends at parties. There are no candid home movie clips (no shots of Rock by the pool, Rock and Tab Hunter playing croquet, or of anyone dressed in women's clothes). If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen). On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson). I'm sure for some viewers these qualities will give the film a sort of underground cult classic feeling and add to its appeal. I found such effects distracting and annoying. On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld). All stones were left unturned.
Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day). Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.",1057708800,54,1380,5.004347826086956
554185,3,6303081096,"A masterpiece about comedy, a perfect complement for ""Pillow Talk"" and other Rock Hudson's comedies. Here, Rappaport make a editing from Rock Hudson's movies of all times, selecting scenes that suggest you the homosexuality of the star/charachter.

554186,5,6303081096,"I can understand the other reviewer's disappointment with this movie if he was expecting some kind of narrative ""memory"" play.  The movie functions as a deconstructive essay, much like Rappaport's subsequent  ""From the Journals of Jean Seberg"".  Think also of the kind of  shoestring budget essay films that Orson Welles made toward the end of his  life (""F for Fake"" and ""Filming Othello"").  This movie  delighted me, made me see some familiar material in whole new ways (how  could I have missed all of that coded material in Howard Hawks' ""Man's  Favorite Sport""?), and was a fun consciousness raiser.  I watched this  with friends and everyone came away buzzing about it.",946252800,18,675,4.990990990990991

Apparently it was intended  as  such, but shoddy video techniques, poor acting, and glaring ommissions  (like Hudson's most gay- subtextual scenes in ""A Very Special  Favor"") made this one a huge let-down. The actor portraying Hudson is  wooden, his narration a string of barely-audible pot shots delivered in a  manner most unlike the charismatic Rock.

554475,1,6303081096,"Rock Hudson had a reel of double entendre clips from his moviesand he enjoyed showing it to groups of gay friends, who found them hilarious.  Released in 1992, ROCK HUDSONS HOME MOVIES expands on this idea: director Mark Rappaport directs Eric Farr, playing Rock Hudson, in an hour long commentary over clips from thirty-plus Hudson movies.  Unfortunately, Rapport's concept is shallow and Eric Farr is remarkably untalented and the script is terrible.  The film is neither documentary nor home moviesjust a clip here and a clip there, with Farr yammering away about how ironic everything is.

Hudson would certain benefit from a serious documentary, but this film is worthless.  You would do much better to see some of the films instead.  May I recommend PILLOW TALK for a start?  But miss this cheaply made and belated attempt to cash in on Hudsons death from AIDS.  Its a waste of time and disservice to Hudson himself.

554523,1,6303081096,"Decades ago, rumors went out about this little insider movie that told lots of gossip about Rock Hudson's sexuality.  There was a presentation down in Hollywood where a mostly gay crowd got together to remember Rock and laugh about what Rock really meant when he said all of those lines in familiar movies of the 1950's and 1960's. This is supposedly that presentation. There are clips from the movies with a voice over presenting a
gay slant to his words.  But, I do not think it is funny any more. It is more of a juvenile group of puns. I would hope that we grew up a little bit since we lost Rock.  His sexuality frankly does not matter.  What matters is that his body of work remains light-hearted, romantic comedy. His movies
are still charming and entertaining today with a much needed innocence. I think that Rock would have wanted people to remember his movies
for what they were not what a pun would make them.  So forget the double entendre. That just takes away from the fun.",1473552000,4,987,4.4916201117318435

Instead they are poorly reproduced clips from his various films that supposedly he showed to friends. I wonder about that. I understood he would show full-length films to friends, especially the films he did with Doris Day. I think this was a poorly designed attempt to cash in on Rock Hudson. A guy who is supposed to be a facsimile of Rock narrates from the grave. What the narrator states is common knowledge to Rock's fans and offers nothing new or insightful for the viewer. It is a long, boring, drawn-out attempt to single out the ""hidden"" gay and homoerotic portions of Rock's films. Problem is, these clips are taken out of context of what they were originally intended.

Personally, I thought the clips with Doris Day were hilarious. She never gets the point, and she always tries to help him overcome his ''shyness"" (about women)..The voice over says, ""Doris, can you say gay?"" Obviously not.
