3531529,5,B001DJ7PY6,"We saw this movie on the big screen, and I can't wait to own my own copy.  As the parent of a 7 year old, we've seen a lot of children's movies (the well known Pixar and Disney titles as well as arthouse and foreign films for kids).  In my opinion, this is the most beautifully made, and well told, animated film ever.  That's a pretty high bar, I know, but I don't think I'm raising any false expectations.

I recommend this film without reservation to audiences of all ages who are in the mood to be transported by a good story, well told, and beautifully rendered.",1224374400,22,567,4.271028037383178

3531554,5,B001DJ7PY6,"A beautiful movie.  I can't believe this isn't more well known.  Certainly stylized in a way we are not used to . . . the figures are more like late '90s videogame cut scenes than like the hyper-realistic computer generated anime put out by Disney.  But the backgrounds are more than lavish enough to make up for the stiff way the people move and speak, and within a few minutes you will be fully transported in the way that only good animation can do.  This movie features scene after scene of some of the most dazzling and lush visuals of any movie.  Furthermore, it held my six-year-old's attention, no mean feat.  A beautiful film, seamlessly dubbed into English, and well worth watching more than once.",1420848000,,707,4.616

3531589,5,B001DJ7PY6,"This CGI-animated movie was done as a Belgian/French/Italian/Spanish production created by Michael Ocelot, a longtime animator whose work includes Tales Of The Night, and Kirikou And The Wild Beasts. Similar to the classic animated film, The Adventures Of Prince Achmed from the 1920s, this was an Arabian Nights-styled fantasy adventure story done in the point-of-view with the characters usually being seen from one side. It was done with lavish 2-D backgrounds and 3-D characters to create an enchanting effect like you're looking at a moving watercolor painting.

 Set sometime probably in the 15th or 16th Century, a European nobleman's son named Azur was raised by Jeane, a Middle Eastern nanny whose son Asmar was the same age as Azur, and Jeane raised them both as her own. She would often tell them stories about the Djinn-Fairy locked away in a mountain waiting for a prince to rescue her. Until Azur reached a certain age, his jerk-ass father sent him off to boarding school and kicked Jeane out along with her son. Years past, and Azur decides to instead of living up to his father's expectations to travel across the sea to see the tales of the Djinn-Fairy are true and free her himself. He gets knocked overboard and ends up in the correct land, but the locals are superstitious about someone with blue eyes, so Azur pretends to be blind. He teams up with a beggar, who leads him to Jeane's house, and she is now a rich merchant. Asmar is also planning on seeking out the Djinn-Fairy the following day too, so Azul goes to the nearby clever but young Princess Chasmous who helps him with some magical items for his quest. Both Azul and Asmar go their own separate ways on their journey, but they are ambushed by bandits, so the two of them eventually have to team up to complete their quest. In the end, both of them enter the Djinn-Fariy's inner-sanctum together, which makes both of them eligible to marry her. After using her magic to summon nearly the entire remaining cast to see how to solve the conundrum of which one she should marry, the Djinn-Fairy calls forth her cousin the Elf-Fairy to help decide(although one wonders why her cousin wouldn't help to free her on her own in the first place). However, the Elf-Fairy falls for Asmar while Azul becomes the winner of the Djinn-Fairy, making for a very happy ending.

I'll admit I was very impressed with the film's approach to telling a story. The mixture of English and Middle Eastern dialogue give it an outstanding international flavor. The animation is revolutionary and mixes in modern computer animated with traditional theatrics. It appeals to all ages, and is really worth seeking out.",1405814400,,2667,4.806100217864924
3531590,5,B001DJ7PY6,"The art in this video is amazing.  Love the storyline in it as well.  Actually, I borrowed and viewed a copy of this animated movie from my local library before deciding to buy it.  Glad I did.",1398297600,,193,4.162162162162162

3531592,5,B001DJ7PY6,"The meticulously drawn backgrounds and beautiful artwork and amazing colors make this movie more than just a cartoon.  It is a work of art.  And while the story is simple on the surface, it has depths, like a myth; that is why it is a movie for all ages.
What is impressive is the intertwined fate of Azur and Asmar, who are of different races, backgrounds, and (probably) religions, but are linked by a bond of brotherhood, having been raised by the same woman.  A mysterious song that they both heard in their nursery days and never forgot serves to set them on a common path.  All of the pieces of this movie fit together like a beautiful mosaic.",1381190400,,649,4.428571428571429
3531593,5,B001DJ7PY6,This animated film is absolutely wonderful.  The story is moving; the color is amazingly good.  i loved it and bought a copy for my grandchildren.  I treasure it,1371427200,,161,4.678571428571429

3531595,4,B001DJ7PY6,"What's good: Characters, including the ones who have to deal with prejudice. Plot, with enough depth to keep a grownup interested. Backgrounds and characters other than human, brilliantly colored and evocative, with some incredible imagery. Costumes, especially Jenane's servants.

What's not: The human characters are animated using some software package that lacks expression, subtlety, individuality, credible motion, and pretty much everything else that brings an animated character to life. I found that especially disappointing in the most important characters of the whole movie.

On the whole, the good parts got me past the not-so-good. It was a bit like having a lush meal at an otherwise wonderful restaurant, and seeing a roach run across the floor - a real damper on what could have been such an enjoyable experience.

3531596,2,B001DJ7PY6,"I'm an avid animation fan and recently I've been trying to introduce myself to lesser-known well-reviewed features. I bought this as an introduction to Michel Ocelet's movies, alongside A Cat In Paris. There is absolutely no comparison. A Cat in Paris is a beautifully animated movie with engaging characters and an active story, simple enough for children but clever enough for adults. Azur and Asmar is a stiff, awkward slapdash piece of work with slightly racist undertones. Why do we need a pale, blonde, ""angel-eyed"" protagonist for a film set predominantly in ""the land across the sea""? It's like watching Pocahontas or Avatar. We've SEEN the perfect white protagonist step in and save the natives. Let's move on to something a little more progressive for our children, please.

The blend of 2D and CG was, I'm afraid, somewhat frightful. There was no life to any of the movement and oftentimes it looked like a cutscene from a poorly-funded video game. Some moments truly were beautiful - several landscapes and silhouetted scenes come to mind, as well as the image used in every promo, the lion and bird (which were only in there for a few minutes! I thought they were a larger part of the story) - but overall the film would've benefited greatly if it had just stuck to stylized 2D.

The story reads like a classic fairy tale, like something you'd find in A Thousand and One Nights or a collection of Hans Christian Anderson's, but unfortunately those don't translate well to screen. The reason Ghibli's and (some of) Disney's fairy tales work so well is they take the fairy tale format and update it for their audiences, adding character development, internal as well as external conflict, and complex solutions to complex problems - or sometimes there is no solution, just a sad situation. The characters in A&A are as flat as their designs. Their motives are murky. The conflict is stale. The ending involves a long, tired, irritating joke, and then a quick copout solution to the pivotal choice that must be made. There's no substance and no emotional connection.

I had such high expectations for this movie, and I was hoping that I'd like it enough to purchase Ocelot's other works. As it is, though, with incredibly weak animation, forgettable characters, a bogus storyline, and a soundtrack that sounded like something you'd hear on a GameBoy, I probably won't be looking too deeply into his other stuff, and I would not recommend this movie to anyone who truly values beautiful animation or well-done storytelling. Go watch A Cat in Paris or The Illusionist instead.",1357948800,2,2584,4.894977168949771
3531597,5,B001DJ7PY6,"The animation and colors used in this movie are absolutely gorgeous. The languages spoken are Arabic, French and English. It's a very entertaining fairy tale with a moral lesson. It's sure to be a hit for the whole family--maybe not for kids that are too young, because reading of some subtitles is necessary.",1356652800,,309,4.849056603773585
3531598,5,B001DJ7PY6,"Americans may not understand it fully as it is talking about the relations between the French and North Africans, which is especially relevant as to the large population of Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians in France (or people of those descents). This film caries nonetheless a beautiful - and universal - message of tolerance, which can easily be transposed to American and Hispanic relations. The graphic design of the animation is unique and beautiful. On a high definition screen, the colours are breathtaking. Great soundtrack. The story is told both in French or English and Arabic, with no subtitles for the latter, but it is pretty self evident and ads to the message. Enjoy!",1356393600,,685,5.070796460176991
3531639,5,B001DJ7PY6,"A wonderful movie for the whole family! An exciting adventure with absolutely the most stunningly beautiful graphics I have ever seen. It is a story about two boys raised together from infancy who were torn apart at a young age. One a Muslim,one a Christian from different sides of the world they learn through their differences that they are the same. They meet up across the sea  each wanting to liberate the djinn fairy and marry her. They learn much on their quest that ultimately leads to a happy ending.",1354406400,,509,4.655555555555556
3531640,5,B001DJ7PY6,"I discovered Azur and Asmar when in Paris last April. The children were watching it on a French channel. I got captured straightaway, as soon as I heard the sounds and saw the beautiful pictures. It is a cartoon full of depth and sensitivity ! If you are romantic and like to be taken to other cultures : this is the DVD to watch... just beautiful !",1352678400,,349,4.223880597014926
3531641,5,B001DJ7PY6,"This film is an amazing story, it brings cultures and caricatures together through the magic of adventure.  All the elements are present, suspense, action, love and trust.  Well worth the watch over and over.",1349049600,,208,5.088235294117647
3531642,5,B001DJ7PY6,"Azur and Asmar is a beautifully animated story for children and adults that incorporates issues of prejudice, multiculturalism, religion and superstition into a story about the rivalry of two ""brothers"" whose shared dream is to free the Jinn Fairy. It is marvelously illustrated and there are lessons for people of all ages in it. My grandchildren love to watch it, and they are very young (pre-school and kindergarteners). The colors are superb. Michel Ocelet is a master not only of animation, but of story-telling in a way that allows the viewer to use their imaginations even as they watch the story unfold. I highly recommend ""Azur and Asmar: The Princes' Quest"" along with ""Kirikou and The Sorceress""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kirikou-and-the-Sorceress/dp/B0007Z9QSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kirikou and the Sorceress</a>&nbsp;and ""Kirikou and the Wild Beast.""

Once upon a time there were two children nursed by same woman. Azur, a blonde, blue-eyed son of a noblewoman and Asmar, the dark skinned and dark-eyed child of the nurse. As kids, they fought and loved each other as brothers do. As grown ups, they mercilessly become rivals in the quest years later, when Azur is being haunted by memories of the legendary Djinn-fairy, and takes it upon himself to journey all the way to Asmar's homeland to seek it out. Now reunited, he finds that she has since become a successful merchant, while Asmar is now a member of the royal guard. However, Asmar also longs to find the Djinn-fairy, and only one of the two youths can be successful in their quest.",1347148800,,708,4.574803149606299
3531644,2,B001DJ7PY6,"The visual style of this film is very striking and interesting, but the animation is unnatural at best and the story plods along like a 100-year-old donkey. It feels like a 19th-century fairy tale translated to the screen, word by antiquated word, with no regard for the very different medium that film is.  I shall add this to my stack of films to watch on mute.",1322524800,2,363,4.5
3531645,1,B001DJ7PY6,"I bought this based on the images and reviews, and expected so much more than what I got. Full disclosure: I work in animation and I've seen a LOT of animation from around the world. I found this film absolutely intolerable. If you are in film school and enjoy studying film for composition, layout and story, this film may set you back several years. By no means do I consider this ""animated"". It is best compared to the computer animated Taiwanese NMA News reenactments you've seen on YouTube and late-night TV lately. Before you purchase this, check out the clips available on YouTube. I'm not saying that there aren't some lovely designs in this film, but honestly, you're better off getting ""The Secret Of Kells"" or ""Sita Sings The Blues"" instead of this. As a film student, you'll learn more, and as a fan, you'll be much more satisfied than if you watched ""Azur & Asmar: The Princes' Quest"". Or better yet, dial the animation history clock WAY back and watch any of the films of Lotte Reiniger. They're available on YouTube as well.",1318291200,6,1039,4.6521739130434785
3531646,5,B001DJ7PY6,The Movie arrived sooner than expected. I was happy with the purchaser. My kids love this movie. It is visually spectacular.,1316736000,,124,4.9523809523809526

3531648,5,B001DJ7PY6,"I've never commented on movies before, but this movie just took my breath away.  Wow!  The artwork is intricate and amazingly gorgeous.  The story well-told.  It doesn't burst into songs for no reason nor has it silly wisecracks.  The beautiful foreign language and one song in the beginning (sung by the nanny to the boys) are appropriate to the storyline.  I was mesmerized the whole time.  Definitely a new favorite!",1315526400,,419,4.9
3531660,1,B001DJ7PY6,"CRAP, that just about sums up this impossibly s-l-o-w and preachy film.

3531661,5,B001DJ7PY6,"This movie is fun to watch as a parent and great for 5+ kids.  Themes of brotherhood, caring parents, cultural diversity and richness, not using stereotypes, strong female characters (both younger and older), love of a mother, and a fun story for kids to watch, too.  Can be watched many times by parents and doesn't get old.",1273449600,2,325,4.684210526315789
3531662,5,B001DJ7PY6,"We loved both versions of Kirikou, so I was intrigued when a friend brought this to us to review.

Although the animation is slightly stiff at moments, the BEAUTY of this film is breathtaking at certain times. Ocelot has a unique visual style, which is evidenced in the Kirikou movies and comes out even more in this film.

I don't think I've ever seen color and patterns used this way in an animated film.

But beyond the visuals, this film has very sophisticated social messages that can reach children of all ages and certainly adults of any age.

Ocelot has a good understanding of the underpinnings of both Eastern and Western cultures, the virtues and vices of each, and he blends it all very well in his movies.

I do believe that Ocelot may be a ""visionary"". He understands that virtue can be measured by the ""content of our character"" and not the color of our skin, material wealth, or other external indicators.

The other thing I liked about this film was the relationship between the two 'brothers'. Ocelot has a very very good understanding of human relationships.. the relationships are not of the ""canned"" Hollywood animation type.... instead, they are very complex, difficult at times, but very realistic and believable.

If you like this film you should also see Kirikou and the Sorceress, another Ocelot film.

I highly recommend this film. Much better than some of the mindless stuff coming out of California.",1270944000,4,1428,4.823770491803279
3531663,5,B001DJ7PY6,"I saw this animated movie reviewed on a TV program and was intrigued enough to purchase it. My husband and I loved the beautiful animations - unlike anything we had seen before. Although the story is relatively simple, it is beautifully done. To anyone who is interested in the folk tales of other cultures, in this case, Middle Eastern, this is something you would enjoy.

But the boys were seperated at a young age.  The story deals with superstitions, and bigotery.  The connecting force through the whole story is love.  I don't want to tell you the story it would ruin your enjoyment of seeing it for yourself.  I truly believe you will love Azur and Asmar: The Princes' Quest.",1264032000,,453,4.345238095238095

3531667,5,B001DJ7PY6,"to the previous reviews, just wanted to add my five stars and echo the praise already posted.  This movie is absolutely beautiful.  The colors are a feast for your eyes!!!

My only critique is a small one, and I'm not sure whether this was only because I watched it on my computer and not the plasma TV:  about halfway through the movie, I noticed that some of the horizontal lines were wavy and moving.  This occurred in a few different scenes...the first was when Azur reconnected with his mother and she provided a feast for him... the table edge was wavy and moving.  I watched half of the movie on my laptop, and when the horizontal lines appeared and were really distracting me, I moved to my desktop PC instead.  Although I could still see it on my PC, it was not quite as obvious nor distracting.  In fact, I started not even noticing it after a while, and maybe it even stopped altogether.

This issue might not occur at all when I watch it on the plasma TV.  Maybe it was a small defect in the film, or maybe it was a defect in my DVD... I'm just not sure.

At any rate, this small flaw in no way influenced my overall impression of the movie.  Five stars.",1262908800,,1166,4.273972602739726

The graphics and especially the colors in this movie take your breath away, the music and singing are very moving, and the story is a new fairy tale, full of wonder and enchantment, but with some nice modern twists to it.  I don't understand the objections of some other reviewers.  There is nothing unsuitable to very young children (it's fine for 3-year-olds, although it may be better for 4-year-olds & up).",1239062400,2,525,4.5638297872340425
3531704,5,B001DJ7PY6,"I can't recommend this film highly enough for children of all ages!  Although the computer animation is a little stiff (the characters don't move very fluidly at times), the artwork is gorgeous, with eye-popping color!  Especially beautiful are the intricate mosaics decorating the homes in the Arab kingdom -- Americans may not be aware that Islamic culture forbids drawings of people, hence in this film as in many famous real world mosques Arabs developed incredibly detailed geometric tile patterns for decoration.

This film has an excellent message of tolerance for other cultures and cooperation (since our heroes wouldn't succeed without help from one another and wise men and women from several different nations and religions).  It also has very strong female characters, from the heroes' mother/nanny (who explains how she ignores prejudice and superstition to move forward and win), to the adorable Princess Chamsous Sabah, who exhibits the best demonstration of a proper princessing education I've ever seen on film!

Some American sensibilities may be put off by the nanny nursing her infant children at her breast in the beginning of the film, or the scene of Asmar disgustedly eating carrion when he is lost in the desert and on the brink of starvation; but I'd hope most adults would be smart enough to watch and explain this with their kids, rather than just hiding it.  These brief scenes are a part of the mosaic of life, and hiding the world from children only stunts them in the long run.",1238889600,55,1510,5.02

Azur and Asmar is a visually stunning movie. The breathtaking colors capture the flair of the Arabian Nights. I especially liked the vibrant flowers. This movie is about courage, sacrifice, love, and brotherhood. It is one of my all time favorite movies!

This movie is truly SPECIAL because I got to meet the one-of-a-kind Director Michel Ocelot and interview him in San Francisco when he flew from his home country of France to appear at the opening of his movie in SF. Mr. Ocelot is a very enchanting man and I would love to learn more about him and his childhood in Africa. Meeting him is truly a MAGICAL experience!

Azur and Asmar are nursed under the loving care of Asmar's mother, whom Azur called ""Nanny"". Azur is a fair-skinned, blond-haired, blue-eyed boy. Asmar is a brown-skinned, hazel-eyed, and black-haired boy. One time, they roll in the mud while fighting with each other, and are covered with mud from head to toe. Another night, Asmar throws snacks to the starving Azur when he is punished by his brutal father.

Asmar's mother told the boys stories of a faraway homeland and the Djinn Fairy, more beautiful than any diamond, waiting to be set free by a handsome prince. Then one day, Azur's cold-hearted father harshly broke Azur and Asmar apart.

When Azur grew up, he sailed over the vast, dark seas, in search of the imprisoned Djinn Fairy, but he got shipwrecked and was washed up ashore on an unfamiliar land. Then he notices that it is his Nanny's homeland because the locals were speaking the same language.

Azur is rejected for his blue eyes, which were thought to bring bad luck. I noticed that there were not many plants and there were only jagged rocks and barren land there. Azur thought the things and people were ugly in the land, so he closed his eyes and said, ""From now on, I am blind.""

I thought it was amazing when still ""blind,"" Azur found two of the keys for the three magic doors that he had to pass later to get to the Djinn Fairy. They were the door of fire, the door of gases, and the door of blades (he had not found the key to the last door). He was guided by a filthy beggar named Crapoux who came from the same land as Azur.
Azur follows a voice, thinking it is his Nanny, and it was! After a feast, Azur saw his dashing brother Asmar for the first time in a long time. Azur then finds the Wise Man Yadoa who tells Azur of the dangers he would face. Many a prince had been eaten by either the scarlet lion or the bird with rainbow wings.

Azur makes friends and gets what he needs from a tiny princess named Chamsous Sabah, who is still very young, but cute and kind. Though the princess was miniscule in size, she was enormous in knowledge, because she was taught by the best tutors in the world (but I think my mom is better!).

The princess learned seven languages. I wonder if she speaks Chinese. She gave Azur the formula of invisibility, a secret that can let him talk to lions, and an iridescent feather.

The princess was agile and ran fast, like a ball of delight with legs! I noticed that there are different scenes in every door Azur passes before he meets the princess, my favorite character in the movie.

The princess was locked in a palace and never allowed to come out. Azur let the princess out on a dark night. She never saw the real earth, a live tree, or a live cat before. At first, she was scared of the kitten, but after Azur reassured her, she stroked the cat and enjoyed it very much.

I noticed the music went fast when Azur and the princess were chased by other suitors of the Djinn Fairy.

The next day, Azur and Asmar set off in search of the Djinn Fairy, but the quest to save the fairy is a rocky one. Through torment and trial together, the brothers finally conquered all their enemies. The funniest part was when Asmar's mom said ""with the tone of my voice, the language doesn't matter.""

My favorite scene is the garden of Asmar's mother, a garden full of imaginary flowers, overflowing with spectacular blossoms, more beautiful than any other real gardens I have ever seen! The most moving scene was when Asmar sacrificed his own life to help Azur win the Djinn Fairy.

Martin Luther King Jr. would be overjoyed to see this movie because it represents his ideals that men ""will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"". Despite Azur and Asmar's differences from the outside, their blood was the same color.

Nothing can break the bond between two brothers.",1237334400,12,5185,4.51334044823906
3531707,5,B001DJ7PY6,"This is indeed a wonderful and beautifully made film, and deserves the highest recommendation for those interested in romance, adventure and fantasy.
The fact that the Arab characters in the film speak in untranslated Arabic is a director's choice that adds wonderfully to the mystery of the enterprise.  I was able to follow the actions and intentions of the characters even though I don't understand the language.
If you like this film, there is a wonderfully made 1926 German silent film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926).  It can rightfully be said that Azur and Asmar is the (great?great great?)grandchild of this film, which was done entirely with paper cutouts!  Try to get a copy of this and be amazed as I was at the fluidity and dynamism of the story and the images.  This too is not to be missed!  Turner Classic Movies shows this from time to time in their Sunday Night Silent bloc.  Look for it!",1236384000,5,914,4.716981132075472
3531708,5,B001DJ7PY6,"I am holding a copy of the DVD in my hand, and the runtime is not 60 minutes. It is the original run time of 99 minutes. It has English and French versions on the disc, and subtitles in English or Spanish.",1236038400,45,205,3.9047619047619047
3531709,5,B001DJ7PY6,"I purchased the original French language version, and thought it was wonderful, agreeing with previous reviews, absolutely gorgeous and unique - I highly recommend to everyone, now I'm looking forward to the English language release.  However, has anyone noticed that the French version says it is 94 minutes, and the upcoming region 1 - English language version is being listed here on Amazon as 60 minutes - I do hope that Weinstein hasn't chosen to cut the film ~ any information out there?",1233792000,,493,4.9397590361445785

8293703,5,B001DJ7PY6,"I adored this film! Watched it, showed it to groups of children, then watched it again just for myself. The beauty and intricate detailing of the backgrounds matched with the equally beautiful simple lines of the figures was deeply satisfying, and for anyone with a genuine love of fairy tales / legends the story is very beguiling. If you are expecting frantic non-stop action plus lots of up-to-the-minute quips and don't mind a bit of blood and guts, this is not the film for you; but if you love beauty in images, a story worthy of Andersen, and something you can enjoy just as much as the primary school age children with you, I highly recommend it.",1515715200,,654,4.598290598290598
8293704,5,B001DJ7PY6,I have grown fond of Michel Ocelet movies in the past year and a half and this one has got to be one of his best in my opinion. It was cute plot wise and visually stunning and as anyone who loves fairy tales can tell you followed that outline to the letter. It is a story of 2 brothers bound in circumstance if not blood and it was wonderfully told.,1495238400,,349,3.9295774647887325

8293711,1,B001DJ7PY6,"There's the potential for a good story here, but the way that it's presented is awful. I barely made it through watching it the first time - At first I wanted to give it a chance, and then I just couldn't believe that this actually made it to production. My fiance and I have (partially) joked that if we ever need to torture someone, we'll just strap them to a chair and force them to watch this movie.",1449964800,,403,4.17948717948718
