3554255,4,B001EHDSPW,"Brilliant show - good follow-up to a breakout first season. The plot points continue to be a little bent, which is familiar enough to be comfortable yet foreign enough to avoid complacense. It is nice to see the drama surrounding the relationships and a militant religious mom character who isn't unsympathetic. The only conflict that seemed contrived was the ""little sister"". The writers should have sent her back home after one or two shows.",1444953600,,443,5.0

3554269,5,B001EHDSPW,"The show was great,the only problem I could see was that these kids were too young to have such grown up problems. I didn't like how they passed around Aiden and Madison,Ashley was too over the top also. Otherwise wonderful!",1411430400,,224,4.625

3554271,5,B001EHDSPW,"South of Nowhere has only one downfall...it only lasted 3 seasons. This classic series set the bar for lesbian representation on a television series.  Its impact was profound, especially for the young demographic that it reached. Superb acting and relatable and well developed characters. This series is a guilty pleasure that never seems dated or becomes tiresome.",1396656000,,365,5.4035087719298245

3554291,5,B001EHDSPW,"This is an amazing show that used to come on ""The N"" network. It's a show about a girl who meets another girl who she ""thinks"" she's falling in love with. She becomes confused about her sexuality, her family is having lots of problems, and everything is just crazy in her life. There are quite a few dark moments but they are balanced by light, happy, and funny moments. It is a great teen drama.",1358208000,,396,4.293333333333333

3554295,5,B001EHDSPW,"I remember when this show premiered and I fell in love with it! I watched every episode regularly and just had to get the season DVDs. The only downside is that they do not have extra features, only the episodes. But you can find behind the scenes stuff online!",1276992000,,261,4.346938775510204
3554296,5,B001EHDSPW,"I got this the other day in mail and watched the whole season in one day after I got off work. This season touched home on two issues for me: coming out and being pregnant in high school. I was scared I would get the same reactions the characters did in this but my mom went into denial instead of screaming me. Although that probably would have been better as we could have worked things out maybe. The interaction between Spencer and Ashley were great. You can see how much they are into each other and how they lives have changed because of each other. If this show had come out in the mid 90s like My So Called Life did we would not have this season or the third season. I am glad that tv networks finally decided to put a lesbian character as the main character in a tv show. Young people where they are guy or a girl need to realize that because they do not like the opposite sex they are not wrong or a freak. This show, this season does a good job of showing that not everyone will hate you for who you love but then not everyone will love you. A lot of times sadly we have to go through this with out own family and closest friends. I know I would have love to had a show like this when I was that again to help. This show helps me now and even though I am 26 I can relate to Ashley in coming out to my dad a few years ago. Maybe one day it will be the right time for me to try my mom again. I recommend this for anyone who likes a love story no matter the gender. It is not just about the lesbian couple but the trials that any teenager has to go through. To me it is like The L Word for teens.",1251244800,,1604,3.893292682926829

3554298,5,B001EHDSPW,"This is the 2nd movie in the season its a stuggle to be different in high school and for Spencer and Ashly they are realizing who they are as ""lesbians"".its a story of forbiddin love.",1243123200,,183,4.257142857142857
3554299,5,B001EHDSPW,"Very exciting, and engaging.  Should cause others to understand the problems, adversities, and opportunities facing young people in the world today.

Before i purchased this product, I wanted to explore how the entertainment community dealt with adversities facing young people, and how this community would deal with these in an entertaining manner.",1237939200,,350,5.711538461538462
3554310,5,B001EHDSPW,"This is a fantastic teen show that follows many issue such as sexuality,race,drugs,homophobia. Although it main storyline is about being gay and comeing out to family,friends i think this show will help and open the minds of young teenagers aswell as older generation. I would defantley recommend this to anyone who is going through the comeing out stage in there life as well as someone who live his or her life in the closet. This is a all rounder show it a shame the u.k don't air this. A great masterpiece and the two main characters Spencer carlin (Gabrielle Christian)and Ashley davies (Mandy Musgrave) play these roles very well.",1228176000,,636,4.844036697247707

As musch as I enjoyed the series, South of Nowhere , when I recieved the dvd set, I found it dissapointing.  Outside of just the episodes, there was nothing else offered for either the webcasts or other media offered off of the -N network.
The stories are excellent and well written and the charaters you coluldn;t do better.  I just wish that there was something else about the series.  Mayber for season 3",1226620800,,599,6.107142857142857

3554313,5,B001EHDSPW,"I was so excited to see that South of Nowhere (one of my favorite and most beloved shows) was out on DVD. I wasn't expecting much, but everything's on them. Good quality, not missing anything, and a pretty inexpensive buy. Definitely go for it, it's worth it! Especially if you want to support S.O.N.",1225152000,,300,4.574074074074074

3554315,5,B001EHDSPW,"I absolutely love SoN.  I think it was shear brilliance when Tom came up with this idea and after three years I cannot get enough of it...I'm very sad to see it end but I will buy all the seasons!  What I did not like was Amazon.  They were horrible at shipping this product and also at giving the discount price when you bought the two seasons together.  Honestly if any where else was selling SoN I would buy it from them but it seems that that is not the case, sadly..  All I can say is YAY south is on DVD but prepare to have many delivery dates because they'll keep pushing it back and back. I preordered South which was September 14 and it was suppose to be shipped the 16th, I didn't get it till October 8th!  And the first season I haven't even gotten yet!  So again I love South I think the seasons are awesome!  I just hate amazon.",1224460800,,841,4.085365853658536
3554316,5,B001EHDSPW,"I didn't think South of Nowhere was intended to be released on DVD and then this.  Yay!  Brave show with guts and taste.  Truly ground breaking.

As for these DVDs, the initial disclaimer of ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD Video 'play only' devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives."" had me wondering what in god's name were they offering.  But the DVDs I received were shrink wrapped and professionally produced.  The quality of the images is outstanding!  No pixilation from broadcast.  Not dark like the iTunes downloads often are.  And it may not be the case for all players, the discs play in both my DVD recorder and my Mac.

The show has come to an end - the final episodes begin airing sometime in October.  But now there are these DVDs and I couldn't be more thrilled!",1222128000,,829,4.496644295302014
