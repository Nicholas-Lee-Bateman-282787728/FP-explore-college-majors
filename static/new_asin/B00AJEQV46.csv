8552635,5,B00AJEQV46,"I saw this DVD last week and almost a week later, this film is still in my head. Granted I don't see many flicks a year (I'm picky), so any film I watch, I usually try to get a heads-up before checking it out. I was intrigued by this film b/c last week I read in Asian rags that the Chinese actress here, Tang Wei, and the film's Korean director, Kim Tae-Yun, announced their engagement. I also saw clips of the highly appealing Korean actor Hyun Bin (sporting a masculine ""stubble"" look), so I finally decided to check it out. Am I glad I did.

From the opening scene to the final shot of Tang Wei, this film unwinds gradually like a flower shedding its pedals. The sometimes deliberate slow pacing forces the viewer to concentrate on the two lead characters. Some folks on Amazon have lodged criticism about the two leads' somewhat shaky English, but it never deters the story. My BF saw the movie with me and was in tears when the final credits rolled.  He didn't even read every subtitle on screen to understand the plot.

The story involves two strangers who meet on a bus and unexpectedly fall in love. But it is not immediate and takes almost the entire length of the film for them to realize their feelings for each other, especially Tang Wei's character. During the course of their encounter, each confronts their own past: One is running away from it while the other faces it -- both unsuccessfully.

Much kudos goes to actress Tang Wei, who maintains her character's sad intensity (her role here swept several awards in Korea). Tender, wistful scenes give a glimpse into her vulnerable psyche and delicate human condition as she battles a tragic past. Hyun Bin is a gorgeous specimen and certainly EZ on the eyes. His roguish look here trounces his ""pretty boy"" roles on Korean TV. But it is his sensitive portrayal of the caddish and somewhat goofy Hoon that wins over the audience.  By film's end, both folks evolve and grow from their encounter. Fate finally catches up to them and lends an unexpected twist.

By half way thru the film, you can't help but cheer for these characters to hook up and sail off into the sunset. Both are lonely human beings longing to connect, and connect they do on a deep emotional level. But this is one film where the characters' past very much dictate their future. The film doesn't quite end where the viewer expects, which adds to its appeal.

The setting of Seattle is PERFECT for this movie. The city's foggy, misty weather appropriately sets the mood for this love story. When the sun finally breaks out at one point in the movie, it also symbolizes a sunny turn in the relationship, but does it last? The highlight comes just at the halfway point when the two sit in their bumper cars in an abandoned amusement park (don't ask me why) and watch another couple from afar. Here director Kim shows his real stuff by making this scene almost mystical in the way it unfolds. It's the film's most magical, romantic scene.

Thankfully, there are no car chases here, no bombs or explosions, no 4-D special effects or aliens falling from the sky (lol)......It's a tender, wistful story directed with a sensitive hand by Kim Tae-Yun and acted beautifully by two highly  appealing actors. When the film reaches its compelling conclusion, it will leave you pondering. I still can't stop thinking about it.

My BF keeps asking me: ""You really let those characters get to you, didn't you?"" Yeah, I did because the film made me CARE about what happens to them. How many movies can do THAT to you these days?? Get this film and savor its appeal time and again. I certainly will.",1405814400,,3616,4.5922480620155035
8552636,4,B00AJEQV46,"I can understand some of the criticism of this film, produced by Quentin Tarantino, filmed in Seattle, WA, and starring gorgeous Korean actor Hyun Bin (of K-drama ""Secret Garden"" fame) and Chinese actress Wei Tang. 80% of the film IS in English, but as usual with Asian actors speaking English, sometimes their English words sound a bit clipped. If you were trying to speak their language you'd probably sound worse. However everything in this film is understandable, despite the fact that this Thai DVD does not have English subs for 99% of the film for the small portion spoken in Korean or Chinese. The couple who are attracted to each other in this film don't know the other person's language so both communicate in English. The woman has temporarily been released out of jail to attend her mother's funeral. We know that she killed someone after being beaten, because her face looks clobbered by the man she killed in self-defense at the beginning of the film. She only gets 5 years so that means she was basically in for manslaughter, not first degree murder. Hyun Bin plays a gigolo who is attracted to her when he meets her on the bus, and eventually falls for her, and we are treated to one of Hyun Bin's famous French kisses with his fellow thespian. That delicious kiss is worth the cost of the whole DVD. Believe me, it's one of the best, if not THE best, kiss I have seen in cinematic history. :) No dry K-drama kiss here, but a really passionate, long, realistic kiss. If you love Hyun Bin, get this movie and enjoy him. He must have made this film right before he went into the military for two years starting in 2010, either before or after Secret Garden. It's delightful to hear him speak English! I loved it! I won't criticize him for that, as others have done. He is perfectly understandable. He's a fantastic actor, so if you love him get this movie.",1388275200,3,1870,4.568452380952381
8552637,1,B00AJEQV46,"1/4 of the dialog is in English and it is not enough to understand the plot.  You do not know who Tang Wei's character has killed or why.  You do not know what importance the man she meets in the garden of her mother's house had in her previous life, you can tell it was something serious by her expression but their whole conversation is in Chinese.  You do not know who keeps calling Hyun Bin's character or why because all the dialog is in Korean.  You do not know if he is being framed or really killed the man's wife as the man claims or if his wife killed herself because everything that wife said to Hyun Bin's character was in Korean.  At the end, you do not know if he met Tang Wei's character after she got out of prison or if it was his ghost and that was the point of them being surprised by the Ghost Tour in Seattle because their main conversation in that locale was in Chinese.  All in all it is a waste of money which is a shame because it was beautifully filmed and well acted.",1379116800,,994,4.097938144329897
8552638,5,B00AJEQV46,"Hyun Bin, what can I say.  I have yet to be disappointed, but I have yet to see him in a role that he does not totally absorb himself into...much like the late James Dean.  The story although plausible was further supported by the choice of setting.  Can two strangers that meet on a bus really find romance in just under 24 hours and then be torn apart by racial hatred and emotional scars from their past. The end scene kept me wanting more, so in my mind I believe the characters did finally get together",1371427200,,507,4.260416666666667
8552639,5,B00AJEQV46,"i love it , it funny and romantic and i did cry a little and it was worth buying, it was hard lookin for it but i found it and i don't share it.",1364774400,,144,3.264705882352941
8552640,2,B00AJEQV46,Advertised as being completely in English.  Not so.  DVD had many scenes with foreign dialogue without any subtitles.  Totally unexpected.  Buyer should have been warned that there will be many scenes of foreign dialogue that do NOT have any English subtitles.  Cannot fully follow story line of movie.  Totally unacceptable.,1359072000,,325,5.4
