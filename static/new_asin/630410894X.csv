7863622,4,630410894X,I first saw this movie on TV way back when it first came out. Recently a VHS copy was up for sale at Amazons and I bought it right away. To my surprise I've discovered this one to be a different edition!!!! I was not aware and believe others may have not been either about a second edition on this movie. It's but a very small detail on the story but I was able to pick it up right away. It sure made the movie far better to watch!!!,1278979200,,433,3.8764044943820224

I give it 5 stars - I recieved it quickly after ordering which was great !",1231113600,,252,3.9607843137254903
7863624,1,630410894X,"I'm pretty sure I first saw this movie on late night cable when I was far too young. I recently made some friends watch it, and they all hated it. So, unless you saw it as a child on accident and now want to watch it as adult to discover why you are a freak, it probably shouldn't be viewed by anyone. That's why I'm rating it a 1, even though personally I love it.",1171756800,4,365,3.88
