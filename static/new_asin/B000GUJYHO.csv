We analyze the stereotypical references and the students write an essay question response about what is ""too far"" when it comes to comedy. Angel's set is kind of sick, and since it is in a high school, I turn off the volume on all the parts that are racy. ~Ani",1481068800,,326,4.109375

8134820,5,B000GUJYHO,I saw this movie in the theater with my son then just with my friends. I laughed until it hurt the first time but the second time around had me in tears. These guys are hilarious!! If you want to forget about your everyday issues and laugh out loud like you did as a teen...this is your movie. I've seen a couple of the comedians in person and this is just a tip of the iceberg in terms of their talent and material. I LOVE IT!!!,1162598400,,429,4.0
8134821,5,B000GUJYHO,I saw this film in the theater and then again on video.  It gets funnier every time I see it.  Having it on DVD is like having a live comedy club show in your living room.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to laugh and/or who has a curiosity about how comics become comics.  The film transcends all audiences so don't get thrown off by the Latin reference - even my Jewish grandmother loved it!,1161561600,,409,4.205128205128205
