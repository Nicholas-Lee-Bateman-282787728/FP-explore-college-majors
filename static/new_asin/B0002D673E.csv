This video is excellent if you are new to shooting or if you are looking for tips to improve your basics. I found a lot of areas that I needed to improve in my grip from this video however, it is not for advanced shooters.

There is also a section about the mind-set of combat shooting which is very interesting. It explains the importance of practice for self defense scenarios. I am looking into other DVDs in this series and will probably use these until I can get to a range regularly and possibly get some qualified shooting instruction.",1246924800,,778,4.433566433566433
