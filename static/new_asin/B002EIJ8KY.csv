8367785,4,B002EIJ8KY,"This DVD is a great opportunity to see this great metal band in their element performing in some great European shows. I am a huge fan of bands like this and don't get to see them often perform in Europe so I was very excited to buy this. They truly deliver also...these bands are so talented and very underrated due to their lack of exposure in the American metal scene. The documentary section is kinda cool because you can see how such a unique band gets its start. The two shows they have on each DVD is interesting in its own right. One show is them playing at a huge festival, the other one them playing at a venue where they are the main event and fans are literally going nuts over them(way more than in any metal show i've been to in America). Some of the crowd antics such as circle pits and wall of death are a display of how much more intense the metal scene in Europe truly is. If you don't know what these are then you need to see them in action on this DVD it is some fun stuff.",1254873600,,993,4.097435897435897
8367786,5,B002EIJ8KY,"The concept of a live dvd that a band puts out is pretty much what most expect: a full concert, documentary, maybe some little extras like bonus live footage, music videos, etc. The way Heaven Shall Burn pulled it off is pretty spot on and then some. You get two full concerts, both with amazing audio quality as the Summerbreeze audio was mixed by longtime friend and collaborator Patrick W. Engel, and the Vienna audio was mixed by Tue Madsen (Mnemic, Threat Signal, Aborted) who also mixed & mastered the Antigone and Iconoclast albums. The extras are split between the two discs as disc 1 features the ""Leitmotiv"" Documentary, and all of the band's music videos while disc 2 features bonus extras as tour diaries, backstage footage, and more. The only disappointment (and this has nothing to do with the dvd itself) is that Century Media didn't bother putting out the CD version of Bildersturm in the US for some reason. You'd have to import it.",1251158400,3,949,4.72289156626506
