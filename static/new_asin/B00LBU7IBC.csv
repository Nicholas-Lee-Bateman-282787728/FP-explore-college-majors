6479418,4,B00LBU7IBC,"So Monday God started making the world, and by Sunday he decided to abandon it. I worry about his attention span.

Once God abandoned the world, both death and new life left with him. If a fatal wound is dealt, the person simply gets up and continues on. The only ones who can lay those who should be dead to rest are the gravekeepers. Ai, a young girl living in an idyllic village, is one of these gravekeepers.
One day a man named Hampnie Hambart shows up. Coincidentally, that is the name Ais mother said her father went by. What might have been a happy reunion is ruined by Hampnie slaughtering everyone in the village except for Ai. Is this man really the monster he claims to be and is he really her father?

The concept behind this series is quite interesting and the series dives into it a bit. If a person is killed, but unable to die, what should be done about it? Should they be forced into eternal rest or allowed to live their lives normally? Does dying change a person?

I was all prepared to hate Ai going in (suffering an overdose of moe characters), but honestly, she wasn't as annoying as I thought she would be. She even grew on me a bit. She is also probably the only character with character development (series is too short).

The first and last stories really well done, while the second story had some cool stuff (like a city of the dead), and we will simply forget about the third story arc (did they really need to try and do a forced school setting in what is basically a dystopian future?).

At only 12 episodes, Sunday Without God is a thought provoking, sweet, and sometimes sad show. It wraps things up pretty well at the end, but does leave room for another season (though I haven't heard anything suggesting one).",1405382400,23,1746,4.409937888198757

8665044,5,B00LBU7IBC,Interesting question: What if God got sick of the world and just left? Beautifully animated but far too short. This world seems to have deteriorated a bet much for the event happening 15 years ago but wow - what a ride!,1418688000,4,219,4.365853658536586
