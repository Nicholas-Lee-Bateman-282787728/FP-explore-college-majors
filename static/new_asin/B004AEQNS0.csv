4307698,4,B004AEQNS0,Easy to follow.  I have been practicing Yoga for years and learned some new positions with this video.  I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get through the entire video (55 min) the first time I tried it but the time went by fast.  If you are a beginner I would recommend the YogaWorks series.  Element Power Yoga is a great addition to that series.,1311897600,,348,4.2272727272727275
4307699,5,B004AEQNS0,"I alternate my yoga and aerobic exercises and try to do at least one each day, so I would consider myself intermediate as far as skill level. I love both of Ashley Turner's Videos that I have (I also have her yoga for weight loss video), but this one is especially challenging. I quickly saw results in the toning my legs, bottom and belly from this video. Of all my videos I think this instructor is the best at describing a pose so that you don't have to look up often. Also, I like that she mixes more spiritual growth reinforcement into her videos as well.",1311033600,6,560,4.2924528301886795
4307700,5,B004AEQNS0,"I have the power yoga, the ""yoga for stress relief and flexibility"" and ""yoga for weight loss"" by Element.
They are all wonderful.
Really they are great!
Good workout, I like that she is narrating in the background while actually doing the moves, so you get a good  auditory and visual description of the poses.
She has beautiful affirmations.
I like having all 3 so I can switch it up, the power and weight loss are both challenging workouts, but I would think anyone could do it, it's not complicated, but it is difficult (in a good way) enough to challenge me. (I would say I'm moderate - advanced level in yoga)",1307491200,,615,4.491071428571429
4307701,5,B004AEQNS0,"I wanted a great power yoga workout thatI can keep up with , works up a good sweat and challenges me to grow in my practice. I love this DVD as one hour is all I can squeeze in during the week and the time flies by with this. Great work out and i love the fact that Ashley provides modifications. Excellent !",1302825600,,308,3.9047619047619047
4307702,4,B004AEQNS0,"this is a great video!  i have done many many power yoga, heated yoga and advanced yoga classes.  this is a great way to supplement or do if you aren't able to hit your normal classes!  its hard enough to get you very warm and limber, but not so hard that a beginner couldn't grasp after oncethrough.",1302566400,,300,4.228070175438597
4307703,5,B004AEQNS0,"Again I love her videos. My husband purchased this video for me to replace another Yoga video that hurt my knees. I was worried that this one wouldn't have a comparable stomach section, but I was pleasantly surprised that it did and that it worked my abdomen quite well and from multiple angles. I highly recommend this video.",1299974400,,326,4.637931034482759
4307704,5,B004AEQNS0,"I have all three Element yoga DVDs from Ashley Turner:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Yoga-for-Weight-Loss/dp/B002EWD0BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Yoga for Weight Loss</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Yoga-for-Stress-Relief-Flexibility/dp/B00429C1W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility</a>, and now Element Power Yoga.  Ms. Turner never fails to develop a sucessful yoga program.  What I like best is that although there are moves that I recognize from most yoga DVDs like the plank, warrior, and downward dog, she always throws in at least a few moves I've either never seen or are very rare for other yoga instructors.  Some exaples are reverse warrior and cresent with your arms wrapped around each other like a pretzle.  I especially like her focus on the abs in this DVD.  She uses planks, but also has other yoga abs moves so that you work the upper, lower, and obliques.  I also like her tone of voice, emphasis on breathing, and cuing.  The 60 minute DVD seemed to fly by, yet I felt I got a decent workout.  I think her Yoga for Weight Loss gives you a little more strenuous workout than Power Yoga, but I felt more in tune with my center after this one.  So I felt equally good afer both, but for different reasons.  I've practiced yoga long enough that the routine was ways to pick up on the first try, and I think others would have the same ease as well, no matter their level. I recommend this yoga DVD to everyone and look forward to Ms. Turner's next one.",1296259200,24,1618,5.487903225806452
4307705,5,B004AEQNS0,"I am not new to fitness but am somewhat new to Yoga, roughly an advanced beginner.  I have several other power yoga dvd's, and this by far is the best.  The poses are challenging enough, but not overly so.  I really like that she spends a decent amount of time specifically on the abs;  she also hits the upper body - there is lots of Chaturanga in this.  So much so that by the time she got to side plank my arms were shaking so bad I could barely hold it.  Let alone do any more Chaturanga's! I like that she gives both Sanskrit & English names for the poses.  This DVD flows very quickly - I would not recommend this to a beginner - you also need to know the poses by name or you will not be able to keep up.  I knew nothing about Ashley when I bought this, so I am really pleased with my purchase.  I wanted a Power Yoga that would get my heart rate up and do enough poses with enough difficulty that my heart rate would be up and my muscles would feel as tho I went to the gym, and this DVD accomplishes that very nicely.  I look forward to more from this instructor.",1295136000,66,1072,3.9906103286384975
4307706,5,B004AEQNS0,"I have all three of Ashley Turner's dvds. Like her other dvds, this one is highly motivational and balanced. I enjoy listening to her well cued affirmations and the poses are challenging but doable.  What I like most is how helpful her instructions and affirmations are.  I wish she would have more dvds out there.",1294531200,10,314,4.6909090909090905
4307727,5,B004AEQNS0,Always feel amazing after completing this yoga routine. Ashley Turner has to be one of my favorite yoga instructors,1481241600,,115,5.105263157894737
4307728,5,B004AEQNS0,"It really opened up my hips. She is great about verbally explaining her alignment so you don't get the pose wrong and hurt yourself. The strength section I could not complete, I will be doing it in chunks until I am strong enough to do them all together. Looks like I'll be getting a lot of good workouts from this until then :)",1471305600,,328,4.222222222222222
4307729,5,B004AEQNS0,"This is a great addition to my yoga dvds. I like yodney DVD a lot, but this one has very many new poses and flows differently. Even after almost year I still feel challenged and accomplished when I finish the workout. The core excercise is wonderful",1468800000,,249,4.434782608695652
4307730,3,B004AEQNS0,"I have practiced yoga for about 12 years and I like a vinyasa flow practice best. I also like a nice combination of standing, sitting, inversions, twists, etc. I didn't get enough of what I look for in a yoga practice, and in the end, I didn't get that loose and wrung out feeling in my body, that leaves me feeling calm and balanced. It was okay. If you want to primarily strengthen, then this is a good video for you.",1465257600,,419,4.185185185185185
4307731,5,B004AEQNS0,"I love the Element Yoga series. Ashley Turner is great.  I also several of her DVDs, which are all fantastic.",1464825600,,109,4.45
4307732,3,B004AEQNS0,"Like the video, but a little to intense for a beginner but will try not to quit.  I have taken a break and looking into a class/video that is a little simpler.  But a excellent buy!!!",1462320000,,183,4.055555555555555
4307733,5,B004AEQNS0,very good,1459900800,,9,4.0
4307734,5,B004AEQNS0,"This is my new, favorite yoga dvd.  I wouldn't say this is for the beginner but I it is perfect for intermediate like myself. My suggestion is to watch it first, so you get a better idea before you start.  I can't do every single thing yet but I have only done it a couple of times.  If you can do everything the instructor asks you to do the first time you attempt a workout, the workout is too easy for you.  There must be something for you to accomplish.  My goal is to do everything she can (or at least 99%) by the fifth workout I do with this dvd.",1455494400,,553,3.945945945945946
4307735,3,B004AEQNS0,"This video got really good reviews, so I was excited to try it. It's not bad, but not my favorite. I think it's the core work that threw me. It's like the middle of my yoga practice got high jacked by a Pilates instructor. I do like some extra core work, but this is a lot and it interrupts the flow. Other than that, it's a decent power yoga class with typical standing poses and lots of yinyasas, though not many twists. I prefer more of those. I am sure I will do this practice from time to time, especially if I want to work my core. But, I have two Tara Lee videos and like them both a lot more (especially Fire),",1455321600,,618,4.032520325203252
4307736,5,B004AEQNS0,Very good level 2 flow video. One of the best (if not the best?) that I have done. Great use of time!! Will definitely buy the video after renting the episode.,1454716800,,159,4.161290322580645
4307737,5,B004AEQNS0,great workout!,1449014400,,14,6.5
4307738,4,B004AEQNS0,"Pretty good. Lots of good stretches and they can really get you tired, b/c you really need to hold the pose, which helps your body get in shape. Makes you work!",1446681600,,160,4.193548387096774
4307739,5,B004AEQNS0,Great voice. Great instructions. I have been doing yoga for 30 years .  Her tapes are the best by far.,1445299200,,102,4.1
4307740,5,B004AEQNS0,She is so motivating.  Great flow and inspiration.,1444608000,,50,5.25
4307741,5,B004AEQNS0,"I really love this workout! I would consider myself an amateur at yoga, though not a beginner. I was expecting it to be a good workout, and it is! It is different than a breathing-focused/meditation-focused yoga, but the name ""Power Yoga"" kind of explains that. I would recommend to someone only if they are wanting to get a lot of movement with their yoga.

Note: there is a section for Shavasana, and she does do some of the meditation exercises, just not a lot",1440460800,,463,4.511904761904762
4307742,4,B004AEQNS0,Started doing yoga and wanted more videos and routines. Gave 4 stars bc it moves a little fast for a beginner but definitely has potential to be a favorite when I get better especially since its supposed to be more of a workout DVD. Like that it is more of a workout then some of the slower moving yoga videos for relaxation. Can use on days when I want a good workout not to relax and stretch.,1439510400,,394,4.12987012987013
4307743,5,B004AEQNS0,"This was my second time to order this DVD, I left my first one when we were on vacation.  Ashley Turner is great I use yoga for backpain and as a way to keep my golf game sharp.",1437350400,,177,3.6578947368421053

4307746,5,B004AEQNS0,"LOVE IT!!! There are a few new things I have done on this, especially some core moves and stomach breathing poses.  If you are not new to yoga and want to get better and better, give this DVD a try. Her tone and descriptions are on point and she is very easy to understand. You don't even really need to look at her because she is so descriptive its not needed at all times.",1433980800,2,374,4.054054054054054

4307765,5,B004AEQNS0,"So far I've really enjoyed this Yoga DVD; the instructor, Ashley is really great and I appreciate the things she says as you go through the poses. I think I've learned a few things, which I always appreciate.  I am a moderate yoga practitioner and tend to do more cardio workouts with and without weights.  Due to a hip injury I've been trying to do more yoga - and so far it's helped.  That being said, there are times when this DVD is challenging (not tough, but challenging) like when doing the yoga push-ups.  Yikes! Overall it's a great DVD and I highly recommend it.",1414022400,,572,4.419047619047619
4307766,3,B004AEQNS0,"I agree with other reviewers, it can be heavy handed on the yogi psycho-babble. I could do without that aspect. This is a solid workout otherwise however. Abs are killer. Seemed a little long, which usually means I'm not staying focused and growing bored. Total tracking time in the cover notes 63 minutes. I'm not ready to get rid of it, but I'm not ready to use again for awhile. Guess that means it's ok, but not great for me.",1412467200,,429,4.375
4307777,5,B004AEQNS0,This is a great video. I definitely recommend it for anyone with a couple years' experience. The pace of the workout isn't overwhelming but it will make you break a sweat. This is a good alternative when you can't make it to the gym.,1410998400,,233,4.318181818181818

4307780,5,B004AEQNS0,I have 4 Ashley Turner yoga dvds (6 workouts) and have been pleased with all of them! I have a lot less pain and tension in my body than I used to and her method makes it easy to finish the whole workout and not feel like I have to do it perfectly or be a spiritual guru.,1406678400,,271,3.689655172413793

4307782,5,B004AEQNS0,"We were accustomed to an active Yoga practice.  Other videos we've purchased are too slow paced, and while good, are not what we wanted for our primary, daily practice.  With this one, we are moving through most of it.  Emphasis is on core strengthening as well as other benefits of Yoga.  Time well spent!",1403395200,,306,4.611111111111111
4307783,3,B004AEQNS0,"Not as good as I was expecting, in that I thought it would be more challenging based on other reviews.  I have been practicing yoga for several years and am very physically active.  Her voice is dubbed over and I would have preferred if she actually spoke while teaching the class.  I also did not find her very professionally dressed.  Not that that really matters regarding quality of the class.",1397001600,,397,4.628571428571429
4307784,5,B004AEQNS0,"Love the Element Yoga series. The instructors are obviously experienced, and I appreciate the reminders to focus on breathing and variations provided during the flows.

4307786,5,B004AEQNS0,"I have purchased all Ashley Turner's DVD's available at this time.  She is excellent in her technique.  She offers meditative readings, breath cueing.  I had to leave my yoga studio as it became too expensive.  I practice at home now, and thanks to Ashley Turner my practice is as good as, if not better, than it was at the studio.  I wish she offered moreDVD's....perhaps chakra yoga.",1389398400,,385,4.686567164179104

4307810,4,B004AEQNS0,"This is an overall good workout.  It didn't seem to contain as much variety as some of my other 60-minute yoga videos, not sure why, but she does talk a lot, maybe that is it.  There is a fair amount of what I would call ""spiritualizing"" or ""self-talk"" - if you can get past that or you don't mind it, then it's still a good workout (she actually said ""ohm"" a couple of times).

I liked that she broke up the standing poses with a good reclining core workout in the middle.  Her cueing is good - not the best but good.  I was able to pretty fully participate in the workout the first time through w/out having to look at the screen the whole time.  She has a tendency to give a long wordy explanation of the motions required to get to a pose instead of just telling you the pose name to start with.  Overall I'm not sorry I bought it, which is saying a lot in the exercise video world! - But a lot of its value lies in the fact that it was relatively inexpensive.",1380240000,2,963,4.063492063492063
4307811,4,B004AEQNS0,"I love using yoga DVDs when I can't get to an actual class, but I was a bit wary buying this one because it was my first one from Ashley Turner. I was quite impressed! It's definitely power yoga, and it's a decent workout- don't buy it if you're looking for more relaxing/restorative/gentle yoga. If you're looking to get sweaty though, this one's definitely for you. I have a number of yoga DVDs, but this is one that I keep coming back to when I want a tough workout that maintains the philosophy and stress-relief of traditional yoga, including breathing exercises and traditional yogic principles.",1377734400,,601,4.733333333333333
4307812,5,B004AEQNS0,"I had tried Ashley's yoga for beginners and I liked it a lot. The idea of considering the body and mind as one and coordinating the breath with postures is an awesome approach. This is how it is taught in India. Only thing is that loosening excerises are missing in the beginning. When I learnt yoga in India we would do loosening of neck, palms, hands, ankle, leg etc before beginning the practice. But, overall this DVD is a good one.",1376697600,,436,4.395061728395062

4307834,2,B004AEQNS0,"Bought this because we have and enjoyed the Yoga for Beginners title from the same group (Element).  However, the instructor in this video, Ashley Turner, has a very different teaching style.  Not saying Ashley's style is bad, just that there was WAY too much personal improvement/development conversation added to yoga pose guidance for our liking.  We also have several DVD's by Rodney Yee and find his style -- focused and WITHOUT the personal development conversation -- to be preferrable.  Will probably turn the audio down on this DVD and just listen to our own background music if we use this one again.",1361836800,7,610,4.950980392156863

4307847,4,B004AEQNS0,I'm a mental health counsellor I prefer gillian michaels work outs and pilates but wanted yoga for after work or when i'm tired. very nice and pleasant. I'll be doing it a lot,1359676800,,175,4.333333333333333
4307848,5,B004AEQNS0,"Even in the corny moments of this DVD (dragon breath) this is an amazing practice!  Ashley is just the best, explaining each move so deliberately you can really feel yourself executing each pose as a teacher would want you to.  Excellent for beginners and masters, a really calming flow practice.",1357171200,,296,4.9
4307849,4,B004AEQNS0,"Pretty happy with this purchase. I would have been more happy had there not been so much warrior and cresent pose in the vinyasas, a change up would have been nice. However, it is an overall body work out including upper body (with pushups and chaturanga) which you don't get in many yoga DVDs.  The ab section is AWESOME - you will really feel it, this coming from someone who works abs nearly daily so it takes a lot to challenge me and she did, for sure!! LOVE that she does wheel. She also gives variations of the poses for beginners or those who aren't as flexible. I'll definitely be purchasing more of the Element series for my collection.",1356998400,,646,4.428571428571429
4307850,5,B004AEQNS0,This is a great video. I have been using this video along with another of the Element series and I have seen remarkable results in my overall flexibilty and mood.,1354579200,,162,4.433333333333334

4307852,5,B004AEQNS0,"After trying it for 3 times, I finally got to love it. Good balanced, unusual but interesting modifications in many positions and not too much distracting empty hippy talking.",1348272000,,175,5.068965517241379
4307853,4,B004AEQNS0,It is too long. It would be great if it gives the opportunity to break it in half or do it all together.,1348185600,,104,3.5652173913043477
4307854,5,B004AEQNS0,"I own lots of yoga dvds and have had my share of ""never again!"" dvds that I bought which were just no good or didn't suit me personally when I tried them. This dvd is really awesome and what I've been looking for. It's quite challenging actually (a wonderful workout), but still very doable with modifications and brief breaks if you're a beginner. The instructor is really gorgeous (but so are most yoga instructors :)) and what's more important, she talks constantly but in a soothing, helpful, absolutely non-annoying way that keeps you focused on the workout and motivated and not get bored. I was surprised to discover how fast the time went by! One drawback is that the workout, about 1 hour long, is still a bit too long. I think most people, including myself, would prefer at most a 45 min. yoga work out; after that mark, it does get a bit boring, at least personally for me. But overall, really excellent. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",1341964800,3,952,4.605882352941176
4307855,2,B004AEQNS0,"I really want to like her, and I've tried three of her DVDs.  But I just don't.  Her workouts feel really imbalanced to me.  There are no sun salutations to warm you up.  She uses the same muscle sets repeatedly, which I'm sure builds muscle but sure is boring and fatigues you very quickly.  Not to mention way too challenging for an average person.

I have been a lifelong dancer, I still take studio classes and I do yoga, and my legs are extremely muscular.  But this is too hard for me.  I feel like you would need to be very advanced in your practice or an athlete to be able to complete this practice.

I am used to a more vinyasa flow based power yoga.  There is a rhythm to it, and your whole body feels worked in balance.  Ashley's routines do not do this from what I have experienced.  She does not adequately warm you up, so you have a higher risk of injury (I actually injured myself doing one of her DVDs, and I have never injured myself with a yoga DVD and rarely injure myself in dance class).

Her poses feel very commercial, even though she does focus on breathing.  And there is SO much chatter.  I appreciate her knowledge of psychology, but when I do yoga I am trying to quiet my mind and get in touch with my body and spirit, not listen to chatter about bettering myself.

Another disappointing purchase for me.",1340841600,15,1333,4.293172690763052
4307856,5,B004AEQNS0,"I bought this power yoga DVD to give me something to do when I'm too short on time to go to the studio before work. It's a really great work out that REALLY gets me sweating and both times I have done the video I have been sore the next day because it challenges my muscles a lot. It is especially great at building core and quad/hamstring strength. It doesn't have very much of a focus on hip openers but it does incorporate yoga poses that stretch various parts of the body throughout the routine. Also the instructor gives some solid advice that really puts me at peace to start out my day!

Overall a great video that I highly recommend.",1339372800,,641,4.297520661157025
4307867,5,B004AEQNS0,"I'm attaching a more thorough review that I wrote on my blog if you're interested: [...]

As for what I have to say here: I do yoga for a myriad of reasons. I love to feel strong, fit and limber. I have a racing mind, anxiety and the urge to compulsively ""over think"" just about everything that occurs in my life. I am enamored by the spiritual and harmonious emotions that stir within me when the soothing voice of an exceptional yoga teacher explains the beauty of life to me. I am infatuated with the strength that this practice is building within my body, mind and spirit. I have discovered, after many years of sporadic practice and a solid year of daily dedicated practice, that I truly do take the ujjayi breathing off of my mat and into the world, and it truly DOES get me through rough spots. Ashley Turner, along with Kathryn Budig, has changed my life. Her Master's in Psychology radiates through her expertise on the body and yoga. The blend is intoxicating and I literally hear the words she says on these DVDs echo in my mind throughout my days. I constantly remind myself, ""The body is an instrument, not an ornament,"" which is a Turner quote that I sometimes want to tattoo on my forehead. It's that good.

Now, about the DVDs (I own the trio of the ""frequently bought together"" amazon recommended DVDs). The workouts = 100% score. They are challenging, I break a sweat, and yet there are resting poses to remember WHY we're here, WHY we've come to out mats, WHAT our intention is within our own practice. Power Yoga is challenging, I am often needing to rest by the last warrior pose sequence and I practice yoga everyday. Be patient with yourselves, I look forward to the day when I can power through this DVD and need not rest - though, as they say, everyday our practice changes. Listen to your body. The weight loss DVD is INCREDIBLE. I am not trying to lose weight, I simply want to stay in shape. The blend of Ashley's expertise, her soothing and kind voice, and the fire building postures makes this DVD a MUST HAVE. She also offers what I consider to be the best savasana guided meditation I've ever experienced on a DVD, EVER. As for the stress relief and flexibility, the two 35 minute workouts are perfect for a short morning practice or unwinding after a long day at work (I work on my feet so the latter is most appreciated). Overall, Ashley Turner's voice is one that echoes positive affirmations in the mind long after you leave your mat, and isn't that what a yoga DVD should really be about?",1337817600,18,2525,4.48695652173913
4307868,5,B004AEQNS0,I've never found a yoga DVD that came close to comparison to my hot yoga classes. This one was it! Challenging and invigorating practice that was just hard enough without being over the top. Sweat dripping all over my mat and muscles were shaking like I was in my normal class. Loved it!,1336003200,5,287,4.433962264150943
4307869,5,B004AEQNS0,"I have been doing yoga for about 3 years now & love it. I have had about every CD out there and I can honestly say that ELEMENT is really the idea I had about yoga. I have all of their yoga DVDS and love them!! I got the ""Power Yoga"" DVD & have been doing it about a week and feel great!!! Definitely recommend it for those who are wanting a good work out but not wanting to get in really uncomfortable positions and dread the work out. Wonderful DVD!!",1334620800,,452,3.978021978021978
4307870,5,B004AEQNS0,"I must admit that I am an Ashley Turner fan, and this particular workout is amazing!  It's long and it will use that extra energy that you have.  I usually feel very relaxed and thoroughly worked out and the end.  Ms. Turner is very instructional and offers modified movements in many cases.  And one thing I especially like about her workouts is that she tells you to be ""generous"" with yourself: Not to go beyond what you can do and injure yourself.  So far her workouts are my favorite, but I am still exploring.",1334188800,,515,4.4361702127659575
4307871,5,B004AEQNS0,"I love this video! I'm fairly new to yoga and have been practicing for a few months now. I'm not new to fitness however and I definitely had a hard time getting through this DVD the first time I did it. Now it's in my rotation and I do it almost weekly. I love her style. There's a lot of inspirational talk which normally I would find annoying, but I really like what she has to stay and it's done well. Definitely worth 5 stars!",1330214400,3,430,4.070588235294117
4307872,5,B004AEQNS0,"I've been taking yoga classes and on/off instruction for about 3 years in several different studios across the US as I write this.  I'm fairly experienced though not an expert.

I found this to be a fresh and nice flowing routine.  That is why I bought it.  Sometimes I don't feel like going to a studio and sometimes I don't feel like ""rolling my own"" routine.  This will get me through a nice workout w/o me skimping anything I don't like (subconsciously of course).  For the price its hard to beat.

The minus is that her comments are a distraction and blah.  I wish I could change the commentary to something more minimal.  This way I can workout and not have to watch the TV but just workout along side.  This is my taste so I didn't allow it to alter my 5 star review.",1327104000,,774,4.275862068965517
4307873,5,B004AEQNS0,This DVD takes you gradually into moves which make it easier for beginners to get into them.  I'm not able to complete the DVD yet but I am gradually getting there thanks to this considerate workout.,1326585600,,199,4.527777777777778
4307874,5,B004AEQNS0,"This is the best power yoga DVD I have seen. The instructor mixes technique instruction and general information about yoga practice/philosophy. And she works you hard. Lots of warriors, lots of vinyasas, a challenging core section and some great poses you don't see everywhere. Options for beginners and experienced practitioners are included, and you stay in the poses for a bit longer than with some other power yoga DVDs, it's good to have time to set yourself up correctly and then stay in a pose to work.",1325894400,2,509,4.862068965517241
4307875,5,B004AEQNS0,Ashley gives clear instruction and offers sanskrit names for poses (although not too much). She gets you somewhat spiritual without being preachy. Loved the tape. Gave me a very good workout at home.,1324425600,,199,5.0606060606060606
4307876,4,B004AEQNS0,"This DVD is comprised of a single workout.  It begins with about three full minutes of meditation.  After that, about 55 minutes of interval yoga poses ensues, and three segments can be designated from the sequence.

The first segment involves standing pose preparation, with crescent poses, warrior one, and warrior three.  It's challenging and has plenty of invigorating vinyasas, including ""yoga push-ups"".

The second is what I consider the ""yogalates"" segment of the DVD, with utkatasanas and an abdominal workout section.  You can definitely feel the burn in your abs during this segment, although I find myself wishing it were shorter each time I do it because it's like doing crunches - pretty boring.

The third section contains more standing poses and yoga push-ups, definitely a heart rate booster.  Warrior two and side-angle pose are featured most prominently here.  It also has a vertical splits challenge that I like because none of the other DVDs in my rotation contain anything like it.

There are no twisting postures or inversions, which would be my main complaint.  Also notably absent is triangle pose.  There is a short segment for backbends (wheel), which I also wish were a bit longer.

Overall, I enjoy this DVD.  The music is not bad as far as yoga DVDs go, and the instructor's voice does not annoy me.  I find I get a good workout, which is the main purpose of power yoga.",1312156800,51,1400,4.872881355932203

8420106,5,B004AEQNS0,"I have pretty much all of Ashley Turner's yoga DVDs and I really like them all. Out of all the yoga dvd instructors, Ashley is the best in my opinion. I love the pace and choreography of the practices. She does a great job of explaining the poses and uses the Sanskrit and English names of them which is nice. She connects the mind-body with her insights and background in psychology, although it's not overbearing to the point where there's too much talking. It's just right.
Regarding this dvd specifically, it's definitely my favorite. It's the most rigorous and also one of the longest (approx 60 minutes). There are lots of vinyasas and I can feel my upper arms and triceps getting stronger because of it. I really like the core work section of this practice. I feel like the more I do each of her dvds, the better they get. I can anticipate what is coming and I'm familiar with the practice so I can push myself more when I want to. I would highly recommend this. Ashley states in her dvd that yoga has changed her life. It's changed mine too, and her dvds have played a huge role!",1485993600,4,1087,4.412935323383085
