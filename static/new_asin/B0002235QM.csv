2054949,3,B0002235QM,"I enjoyed this version of the great Shakespeare tragedy. Ms. Suzeman was superb as Cleopatra, black face and all. The cast shines and makes up for the very sparse sets and minimalist production. It is also interesting to see Patrick Stewart (with hair!) in an important supporting role. Nevertheless, I am very much partial to Charlton Heston's version of this play which was done as a movie rather than as a play, as this one is. That version is nearly impossible to find on VHS and impossible on DVD.",1188777600,3,502,4.651685393258427
2054950,4,B0002235QM,"The acting is beyond superb.  Ms. Suzman IS Cleopata.  My only complaint is the directing.  This DVD consists of 90% talking heads.  The close up lens for the camera was obviously the only one available. The play is done on a stage, but it is almost never seen.  Way too too much facial.",1139184000,7,287,4.339622641509434
8020174,5,B0002235QM,"I'm reviewing this based on the VHS version which is pitiably fuzzy. Finding a watchable Antony and Cleopatra is difficult. The BBC TV version is unwatchable because of the severe unsuitability of leads. Yes, the play is political, but in most productions the political dimension is the only one the director is able to manifest. Perhaps both Antonya and Cleopatra are unplayable characters, and yet here, they succeed. Flanked by an absolutely tremendous Enobarbus and Lepidus, not to mention the chilling thing that is Octavian's New Rome.

My question is, is this edition remastered or does it have as poor resolution as the VHS version? Is there a better one?",1492560000,,663,5.027272727272727
8020175,5,B0002235QM,"This is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. I doubt many people make that statement, but since my first reading of it at age 18, I hold it very close to my mind and heart. It is not as cerebral as CORIOLANUS, but compared to his earlier tragedies, cerebral does describe much of its impact. It's as if Shakespeare was continuing his mode in TROILUS AND CRESSIDA of casting a cold eye and analyzing his characters. dissecting them really. However, the language of this plays raises it to the empyrean. It is simply one of the most incandescent expressions of the English language in all of its history. I mean that!! By downplaying spectacle, and using simplified sets, Trevor Nunn allows the actors to shine and the language to glow. The two principals inhabit their roles with grace, power and, yes, charm. Janet Suzman, alone in Act V after Antony's death, rises to greatness as Shakespeare intended. Her suicide is tragically redemptive as he surely intended. This is Shakespeare's mature take on romantic love, and he treads a thin wire of both revealing their degradation and celebrating their passion. The actors are very skilled at making us feel both responses to this love affair are justified. Cleopatra keeps testing Antony's love which he keeps proving again and again - to his destruction. When Richard Johnson recites the line, (SHE) BEGUILED ME TO THE VERY HEART OF LOSS, it is heart-breaking. It is one of Shakespeare's most passionate moments.",1419897600,2,1462,4.899193548387097

8020177,4,B0002235QM,"This, the Royal Shakespeare Company production of a little viewed play, was produced in the early to mid 70s. It boasts of flashes of brilliance. Richard Johnson's performance is at times inspired. It features a very young Patrick Stewart as Enobarbus, in a very strong role. The production is set in a very minimalist fashion, which provides a very good effect overall. However these very real moments of brilliance marred by the more than frequent instances of overacting. Janet Suzman as Cleopatra in particular is guilty of screaming and wailing where a more subdued rendering of the anguish she undoubtedly felt would have sufficed. Other supporting players are also complicit in the all-too-frequent over-the-top acting. Even Johnson takes it a bit too far at times. This version should definitely be sought after and viewed, because there is another aspect from which the producers can take heart: It is better than the version with Charlton Heston!",1362700800,,956,5.174193548387096
8020178,4,B0002235QM,"Being a TV version of a famous RSC production, this is indeed (mainly) an excellent version of the play, with the actors well into their roles by means of stage experience. However, there's a major flaw: presumably to render the length palatable for TV audiences in the late '60s, the performance cuts out the important Sextus Pompey subplot. If this role (and that of his pirate allies) is excised, we lose some crucial political, military and historical detail which enrich the play and the characters of both Antony and Octavius. Check out the text for details, and you will see what I mean. So, loss of a star (and I nearly made it two) for such thoughtless interference! My first choice must be with the BBC Shakespeare version, beautifully and thoughtfully directed by Jonathan Miller, with Jane Lapotaire and Colin Blakely both first-class. The RSC version remains a wonderful -if irritatingly incomplete- second choice.",1278028800,3,927,5.025974025974026
8020179,3,B0002235QM,"I bought this to show my students who had voted to read Antony and Cleopatra and got lost in the complicated plot and ""young English."" (I'll never let them choose again.) It certainly helped them to grasp what was going on and to hear the language spoken by people who knew what they were saying. Its style is dated. Most of all, Shakespeare requires a live audience. Without audience response, part of the magic is missing. I have seldom seen stage plays on film that have worked, unless they have been rewrittten for the screen or the director understands theatricality.  When you shrink it down to television (we don't have big screens at school) the spectacle is lost.",1258848000,5,672,4.694915254237288
8020180,2,B0002235QM,I read elsewhere that this was the best rendering of the famous play available on DVD.  The performances and the appearance seemed very dated and almost amateurish.,1230076800,2,164,5.074074074074074
8020181,4,B0002235QM,"If you enjoy good acting you will like this version of Antony and Cleopatra.  It doesn't have much technology and the sets are very simple, but it has much to offer in characters who deliver their lines with great eloquence. The actors playing Antony and Cleopatra are quite  convincing in their powerful emotions as they perform their roles as Shakespeare intended.  Although there are too many closeups of the actors' faces, that doesn't detract much from the theatrical experience of this TV production. However, it would have been more visually appealing if better sets had been available. Providing us with more background instead of having us look at people's faces most of the time would have made this program more watchable.  Still, this is probably one of the most accurate versions of the play with the characters holding your interest instead of exterior spectacle.",1227744000,5,877,5.069444444444445
8020182,4,B0002235QM,"It was filmed for TV and is a bit lacking in visual quality but very much worth seeing for the performances - I enjoyed seeing a young Ben Kingsley in a minor role - also Patrick Stewart was very good - sad and funny. The cuts to the play were not very deep for me - it does run 2 hours, 40 min.",1216598400,3,295,3.6984126984126986
8020183,5,B0002235QM,"Directors of ""Antony and Cleopatra"" must decide what story to tell. Should it be the geopolitical conflict between East and West, the refined culture, hedonism and mysticism of Egypt versus the stern militarism and morality of Rome (and its Judeo-Christian legacy)? Or, should it be a tragi-comic near-melodramatic story of great lovers torn apart by war and their human frailty, but finally united in death? Or, should it be a chilling power struggle, stuffed with machiavellian deceit, betrayal and murder? Trevor Nunn's Royal Shakespeare Company production succeeds in telling all three stories, remains faithful to Shakespeare, and provides entertainment that is easy for contemporary audiences to enjoy. Given Nunn's success with this play and others,  why are so few RSC productions of Shakespeare available in the United States?

Nunn elegantly portrays the difference between Rome and Alexandria. Rome is presented as if in a bare, large, air-conditioned, brightly lit room. The background is pure white. Caesar and the Romans look clear eyed and freshly showered, shaved, with hair cut short and neatly combed, wearing pure white robes, so unwrinkled they might have been starched. Everything is simple and transparent, there is right and wrong, good and evil, truth and falsehood, and one's duty is to do right. That is, one's duty is to faithfully serve Octavius Caesar.

In Egypt nothing is pure or simple. The air feels thick and objects appear hazy, as if seen through a fine gauze. Intimate rooms glow warmly with gold,  silken-satin colored fabrics, richly embroidered tapestries, and immense luxuriously upholstered cushions. Ancient flutes and harps provide music, the moody food of love. The shimmering heat of the desert is a palpable reminder of strong emotions, and Cleopatra's palace is a mirage.

Janet Suzman is a sensual alluring Cleopatra, a woman who used her sexuality to manipulate Julius Caesar, then Pompey the Great, and now Mark Antony. Little wonder that the Romans mistrust her, the serpent of old Nile. Her constantly and violently shifting moods keep Antony off-balance and intrigued. Her sighs and tears are like forces of nature, great winds and rains, and as loyal Enobarbus assures Antony, she is a great piece of work, not to be missed if you happen to be in Egypt. And yet, Antony makes a marriage of political convenience with Octavia, a holy, cold and chaste Roman matron, very much the opposite of Cleopatra, not a good match for a man who has cultivated the pleasures of the East. Eventually, Octavia, who was to have bound Antony and Octavius in peace, provides the pretext for open warfare when she returns to Rome and Antony is drawn back to his Egyptian lover. The ill-starred marriage is the critical point at which Antony's fate finally tips toward his tragic, inevitable defeat.

Richard Johnson, a lusty masculine Antony, is the one-time valorous soldier, now lost in the pleasures of his relationship with Cleopatra and hard-partying with the Egyptians.  Antony, although a Roman, wears a beautiful multi-colored robe with gold chains and jewelry. Once a war-hardened soldier, he is now ensnared by the hedonism of the East, shown by his rich, flowing speech, slightly unkempt beard and longish hair, and habitual feasting and drunkeness. Relaxing with drink in what appears to be a plush seraglio, with his trusty second in command Enobarbus, Antony reluctantly persuades himself to return to Rome.  He is no longer the hero who revenged the assassination of Julius Caesar and bargained with Octavius to rule the world.

Corin Redgrave is Octavius, the clear-sighted, goal-driven Roman who prevails through superior organization, discipline, deceit and treachery. Young, efficient, and ruthless, Octavius would be at home today as a brilliant hedge-fund manager with an MBA from Harvard, reshaping the world by taking over old corporate empires and destroying them to build anew. His clean aryan appearance and fascist ethos provide a chilling subtext for the war against Cleopatra and Egypt. Antony may be a dissipated worn-out warrior, but he is honorable. Octavius is soulless power-broker who lets nothing get in his way, admired and feared but never trusted or loved.

The ambiguous atmosphere of Egypt conforms with ever changing views of reality - metamorphoses - counterpoint to the Roman illusion of certainty. Antony says, ""let Rome in Tiber melt."" Cleopatra on hearing of Antony's marriage to Octavia threatens to melt gold and pour it down a messenger's throat, and let ""Egypt melt into NIle.""  Having lost a key battle Antony feels ""authority melt from me,"" and he compares his life to the shifting clouds in the sky that first appear one way, and then another. When Antony dies, Cleopatra grieves that ""the crown o' the earth doth melt."" Octavius wins, but Antony and Cleopatra elude him in a suicide pact. Even in defeat, as the final curtain comes down on the stage, the East, one feels, will go its own way. There are no simple answers in this play and Trevor Nunn, graciously, does not try to provide them.",1211846400,20,5082,5.133010882708585
