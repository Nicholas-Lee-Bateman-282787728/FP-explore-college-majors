8502768,1,B006PH2ZHS,"Just opened package to watch.  With in less then 1 minute of play it did nothing but skip, after a closer look the tape has scratchs. Know it's to late to send it back for a new one. Review all DVDs as soon as you get them. My son is so disappointed about the DVD, it so upset him that he could not watch it. My son is 8 and has Autism, ADHD,RAD so any of you out there know how devastating this is to him. I can not afford to buy another so please take my advice to review your DVD's once you receive them.",1462665600,,507,3.7830188679245285
8502769,1,B006PH2ZHS,"The content is good from what we saw. My children enjoyed it. My less than perfect 5 score is because the disk is not high quality and would not play in some DVD players, and when we found a DVD player it would play in, only one disk was watchable. The other was not able to be viewed in its entirety due to the quality (and these were NEW). It was kind of pricey to not work, and I really wanted the children to see both disks.",1462060800,,428,3.9310344827586206
