693198,4,6303534384,"I have recently worked my way through the first video in the series, and am now into the second.  This is an excellent tape to work out with, and it is serious!  THIS IS THE TAPE that I have been looking for, and anyone  else interested in ashtanga yoga should be as well.",920160000,,272,4.09433962264151
693335,5,6303534384,"I absolutely love this video. I've purchased other yoga tapes that I was bored with after the first time. Not this one! The first two times I did it, I didn't even finish it. The third time I did it all the way through. This is also the only video that left me sore the next day, which is a good thing. I like to feel like I actually made a little progress and aching muscles are a good indicator of that. I still do not have all the poses mastered, but that makes it that much more enticing. This is definitely a video I'd never get sick of. I find Bryan's voice to be very soothing and his directions easy to follow. He also doesn't make you feel that you have to do each pose perfectly, as there is no ""perfect pose"". I definitely recommend his videos.",1011657600,4,755,4.108108108108108
693336,5,6303534384,"I have never done Yoga in my life and wanted to try it.  I started with Brian Kest's First tape and it was so well made and easy to follow and I could see myself improve enough to order this 2nd video.  Now I'm ready for number 3!  I've never had Yoga experience before and this made it all good. He's careful to explain every move and it doesn't take long to get used to the names of positions and how things work. I haven't been this flexible since I was a teen and it has helped with nagging back problems that I have had for about 5 years.  It is truly a great video that I accidentally stumbled on while reading reviews as I was searching. If you want to learn how to do Yoga, this is the tape for you. Start with his first then move to the second. It's fun to see yourself grow in this neat experience - both mentally and physically. I couldn't write this if I didn't truly believe it.",994032000,2,891,4.045454545454546
693337,5,6303534384,"I purchased this tape when I had only a beginner to yoga, practicing mainly yoga zone workouts.  I really wanted something I could grow with so I went with the reviews.  This tape really is great- for so many reasons.  When I started, I could only do 20 minutes or so at a time.  Now I have worked my way up to doing the whole workout- and even though I flow through the program, there are still many many postures that I have to improve upon and strength to gain.  I have done this work out so many times, but I still look forward to Brian (he makes it all worth while) saying ""this is our yoga for the day, let's respect ourselves"".  Quite inspiring.  Finally, this production really makes you feel like you are in his studio attending his class.  There are no strange lights, smoke, or unusual settings.  You feel like you are right there- I find that much more enjoyable.  Basically, I have bought and used many yoga tapes and this one is so far the best I have found.  If you want something that will keep you interested and challenged for a long time, this is it!",991180800,11,1069,4.268656716417911
693338,4,6303534384,"I consider this my 'hard' Yoga tape and have to psych myself up to do it.  It is challenging and definitely makes you work!  Kest does a relatively good job of explaining the poses and what muscle groups they work, and holds the poses for long enough you can feel those muscles working (a gripe I have with other Yoga videos).
I would agree with several of the other reviewers, however, that Kest can be a bit annoying.  What I think he's trying to convey is sensuality and stillness, but he instead comes off looking a bit creepy. Well, a lot creepy.  The hard bodies he has in his class are a bit intimidating as well, but can also be inspirational.
While not for beginners, if you're looking for a good Yoga workout that will make you work & sweat this is a great tape to have.",984355200,5,780,4.285714285714286
693339,4,6303534384,"This really is a great workout. My legs get to shaking everytime and I'm nowhere near mastering the poses. I give this tape four stars because of the workout. I took a star off for the instructor. I have tried and tried to be objective and open minded to Bryan's style. But try as I might, I just don't like it. He is very annnoying to me and if I were in a class where the instructor started rubbing his hand on my thigh, I'd probably clock him! That being said, as long as I don't look at the tv, and just really concentrate on getting into the poses, I have a good time with this tape. It will challenge you, and stretch you. Great workout, poor instructor.",980467200,2,660,4.1640625
693340,3,6303534384,"This is definately not a beginner video, it moves along at a pretty fast pace, very challenging. I found that the low budget production value made it a little hard to follow, at times the audio is too low, so you have to stop and adjust the volume-very annoying. There are better quality videos available in this price range, like something from the Living Arts collection.",977875200,2,373,4.666666666666667
693341,5,6303534384,I liked the Power Yoga 2 for toning the best.  It really works the areas that need the most attention.  What is good about Power Yoga is that your not in the mindset of toning your body. With each workout I can go further and further and that is a great feeling.  I have become flexible and toned.  The beauty of it is that I am enjoying the process and reap the benefits.  Power Yoga is the best insurance you can buy for your health both body and mind.,974505600,3,454,4.056179775280899
693342,4,6303534384,"I have owned this video for a few months now, and I only use it when I cannot get to the gym once a week to take yoga from a live instructor.  That said, the tape has quite a range of difficulty - there are some poses  that are very difficult (or at least at my intermediate level) while most  of the tape is approachable.  Kest suggests alternative variations for  different fitness levels for many positions.  I have not found his style  annoying at all and, for the most part, think he is very positive and  laidback.",965174400,16,520,4.288659793814433
693343,2,6303534384,This is not a video for a Yoga beginner...very difficult to follow and Bryan Kest is very annoying as a teacher...that is if you are into the whole Fabio thing.,959904000,4,160,4.366666666666666
693344,5,6303534384,"Make no mistake; this is not a workout for people new to yoga.  I've been practicing yoga for two years, and this workout was challenging.  However, I never felt any ""peer pressure"" to do anything I didn't feel ready for.  Mr. Kest does an excellent job presenting a class that works the body  vigorously that also soothes and calms the mind.  I'm very happy with my  tape and would recommend it to others.
Despite comments made to the  contrary, I didn't notice any strong accent in Mr. Kest's voice.  I do wish  I heard him more clearly at times; the sound quality on the tape is a bit  lacking.  This can be a bit frustrating, as many yoga positions make one  face away from the screen!",959040000,16,689,4.380952380952381
693425,5,6303534384,"This is the best yoga video ever.  If someone is looking forward to be in a good shape, this is the answer.  Bryan makes the video very easy to follow for beginners and quite challenging for intermediate/advanced,  because you feel that you want to do more and go further.  Bryan Kest is  the MASTER...!  He is the true ""Human Pretzel""... :)  p.s.  summer is coming...  you better hurry...",957398400,4,389,4.602941176470588
693426,4,6303534384,"This tape is definitely for advanced yoga students.  Don't do this tape with food in your stomach or you will get sick.  Or at least I made the mistake of doing this tape after lunch, and felt sick to my stomach  afterward.  It's a great workout, but only for those who are already in  great condition.",955324800,5,302,4.321428571428571
693427,4,6303534384,"Very user friendly full body workout.  The instructor talks us through each pose, including breathing, head and neck position and level of intensity.  I am in very good condition and I work up a sweat.",952041600,6,201,4.714285714285714
693428,4,6303534384,I was so sore after doing this the first time I swore I'd never do it again....but I did and loved it....and continue to love it.  It is a great workout for those days that I just don't feel like running or doing  aerobics.  I do this and I feel like I have done a beneficial workout while  being relaxed at the same time.,950832000,8,322,3.984375
693429,5,6303534384,I have been doing Yoga for about 8 months and was hesitant to buy this tape because of one of the reviews.  It is a great tape.  I love it.  It is challenging and I love that.  I feel like he really wants you to do well.,948153600,7,220,3.617021276595745
693430,5,6303534384,I find Yoga and this tape to be top notch at helping me lose inches.  I have lost 2 inches in my already size 5 waist which is now a 4 AND I had a baby 3 months ago!  The ONLY thing I did different was incorporate this  Yoga program into my 60 minute fitness routine.  I found Brian Kest to be  skilled and the class motivating.  My legs felt like jello afterward and  they haven't felt like that in years.  It really brought my body and mind  to a new level.  I have found what I have been missing in my fitness life!,947808000,5,518,3.894230769230769
693431,1,6303534384,"The production values of this tape are quite high. I like the warehouse setting, the advanced level of the practitioners - BUT that doesn't hide the fact that I don't think Bryan Kest knows much about yoga, and he's  certainly not an advanced practitioner himself!
Look closely at the  editing of this tape. When Mr. Kest is demonstrating a pose, you see a mere  flash of it, usually not at full extension, and often showing sloppy form.  Most of the time he walks around and coaches without providing much  information about the poses.
Now look at his posture and body carriage.  Advanced practitioners of yoga carry themselves in a natural mountain pose  - they've practiced it so much that perfect posture is second nature. Bryan  Kest has terrible posture. This is a dead giveaway that he either practices  ignorantly or not at all.
In short, I don't think much of him. Try the  Yoga Journal series - much better instruction by real yoga instructors.",946512000,14,954,4.762195121951219
693432,2,6303534384,"I have mixed feelings on this one. It's hard to take Kest seriously. It's hard to take _anybody_ seriously when they attempt to use the fact that they train ""the stars"" (celebrities, that is) to gain  credibility.
He does not adequately explain how to get into most of the  poses, and the video fails to help as the camera is often zoomed too far in  or too far out. I, too, found myself wondering what the heck I was supposed  to be doing. I did like some of Kest's coaching comments, especially his  reminder that not all of us have the same bodies so the poses are going to  look different for different people. I also like his gentle urging to push  yourself to the edge.
Yes, the warehouse setting is distracting if not  disturbing; the music even more so. Both seem at odds with yoga meditative  environments.
I would call this ""Power Yoga"" an Americanized  version of yoga, adapted to fit into American lifestyles with a hint of  rebellion against traditional yoga principles. I, for one, think a lot of  substance was sacrificed in the process.",942796800,14,1052,4.566844919786096
693433,5,6303534384,"I was in great shape when I started using this tape, but I have advanced through many stages since. His calm and soothing voice relaxes me, and the more relaxed I become, the better it gets. I started with the first tape,  and six months later have perfected the third, moving at my own pace and  using it three times a week. It is the perfect after work workout.",939254400,3,363,4.246376811594203
7851829,5,6303534384,Video and service are both the best.  Definitely not a beginners tape.  Leans way more towards advanced and beyond poses.  Bryan Kest explains how execution of each pose should be.,1362009600,,180,4.933333333333334
7851830,5,6303534384,"Wow, I just did this tape for the first time this morning. It was unbelievable!

 I've been doing yoga for about 4 years and did years of weightlifting before that so I was definitely not new to exercise. I can honestly say this was the single most challenging routine I've ever done.

 I followed Kest's advice throughout the tape and rested or modified as I needed to and by the end of the tape my heart was pumping, my mat was covered in sweat and I was forever grateful to have made it to ""relaxation pose"" (which I stayed in for quite some time I might add). I can see that this is a tape that will remain challenging for some time (if not indefinitely).

 I wanted to make a comment regarding those reviews that criticized this video because of the style of the production, or the appearence of the instructor and students as being too california or slick etc..... Anyone who actually DID this tape wouldn't have been even aware of that stuff because they'd be too busy DOING this tape. I had the same reaction to the MacGraw/Schiffman tape when I first got it, I thought it was too Hollywood and slick, that the music was too intrusive, but then I figured that before I criticized it I ought to really DO the routine and now it is one of my favorite tapes to work with.

 Regarding Bryan Kest himself, I found him to be very sincere and appreciate that he constantly stresses that it's not how the pose looks that's important but the sensation of the pose and the breath. This makes it possible to start working with these tapes even before you can achieve the postures (even if you never get them to ""look"" perfect). He really inspires you to want to push and challenge yourself within reasonable limits but without crossing that line where you might get an injury.

 I have many many yoga tapes (including David Swenson's which are fabulous, several with Rodney Yee as well as Patricia Walden's, Kripalu (Lundeen/Cope), as mentioned the MacGraw/Schiffman's and others) and this is up there at the top of the list with the best of them.

 I am really grateful to have bought the three set collection of Kest's and am looking forward to trying the 3rd tape as well (which I'm sure I'll be having to modify and rest thru in sections as well).

 Kest is fantastic! I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is interested in Power Yoga!",1090800000,8,2336,4.491725768321513
7851831,5,6303534384,"This is probably the best power yoga video on the market, even after all these years.  For me, there is no other video that so completely strengthens, stretches and releases the power of the lower body.  Even after doing this tape and others regularly for several years, I still enjoy the chance this tape provides to dig deep into the legs and release the power present in our bodies.  Also, while this tape is a well-balanced workout, it does not hit the upper body as hard a some tapes (most tapes seem to hit the upper body harder than the legs) so it is a key change of pace and counterpoint to tapes hitting the upper body hard.  If you relax, sink into these poses and breathe deeply, you will feel a great strength and energy the whole day!",1065830400,10,748,4.359712230215828
7851832,5,6303534384,"I have used many videos and CD's , this one and his sweat video are the best ones of that he has out- you will get a good efficient workout and a great yoga workout.  One of my other favorites is Jonathon Fields, New York- advanced yoga video.",1051920000,4,243,4.0625
7851833,5,6303534384,"I've been doing Power Yoga for a few years now and am advancing to Intermediate. So I am discarding my Beginner's tapes and looking into some stronger stuff. I checked out the instructors and wanted to try Kest. This was his first video I bought. I now own three with one on the way!
This is a really challenging workout. It is not a beginner's workout, however. In addition, he doesn't give the names of the asanas --- I wish he would. He did in the first tape in this series so I guess it's best if you get it and do it first. I would prefer an instructor to say to take Crow than to say put your hand here around . . . etc. Or worse, to just have the class do it.
Having said that, it was not that hard to follow and I love Bryan. He is so totally cool and inspiring, such a wonderful instructor. I do think that he and Baron Baptiste both are a bit too touchy-feelie with some of the students --- a bit inappropriate.
But all that aside, after the workout I knew I had worked every muscle. I was sore for two days! But I felt great mentally and physically.
So for anyone who has a bit of Power Yoga under their belt and who wants to progress to a more advanced and probably longer class, I highly recommend this video and this instructor. I was more challenged and felt more muscle soreness doing this video than Baron Baptistes new one.",1032652800,13,1341,4.14176245210728
7851834,5,6303534384,"I love this workout. Even though at first I was trembly and my breathing quivered in many of the poses the feeling afterwards was so addicting that it didn't matter. It's as if my body knew what was best even though my mind screamed excuses all the way to the mat and halfway through the routine (didn't stop it from claiming to be a champ afterwards, though).
What's really amazing to me is after doing Bryan's workout for a little over a month I was able to enter into formal Ashtanga practice and keep up which frankly I would have never thought possilble until it was happening. Again I was scared but my deeper body wisdom just plopped the money down for the class, rolled out the mat and said ""Lets Go!""  In fact, the first day I did two without any soreness, just that wonderful wallowing in prana feeling as my bones ooze nectar and everything takes on a deep peace.
Even though I'm deep into the Ashtanga Primary Series I still feel like I have to do a few of the asana's that are in this routine or I just don't feel finished (they're the ones I used to dread the most but now are the ones I can't live without!).
Volume 2 is my favorite in the series. Thank you Bryan for putting me on the path that is making me love life.",1029715200,8,1234,4.228813559322034
7851835,4,6303534384,"Being a first-time yoga participant, I have really enjoyed doing both of Mr. Kest's videos.  I can tell from some muscle soreness on my back and stomach areas that I am working muscles that I'm not reaching through running.  I would recommend this video because Mr. Kest does a very good job in describing the poses and also giving alternates for beginners and more advanced levels.  I have not yet attempted the 3rd volume but I am looking forward to trying it out sometime in the future.  And, you really do work up a sweat depending on how you hard you want to work.",1026259200,,569,4.4423076923076925
7851836,5,6303534384,"Brian Kest's Power Yoga video series are the best I've come across so far. I own quite a collection of yoga videos that I use in my home practice and this is definatedly my favorite.
If you think you can't get a wourkout out of yoga, try any one on this series by Mr. Kest and you will feel your muscles burn at the end of the class, not to mention lot of sweat. But since it is yoga, you will also feel relax and stress free after the session. This series is not recommended for someone new to yoga, one must have some basic knowledge and be familiar with the poses in order to get the best out of it. If you're a novice forget it, start with the ""Living Arts series"". If you're like me, who wants to get something extra out of your regular or basic yoga practice, this is the video series for you. There are several students in the video performing at different levels of flexibility or intensity so you can relate to, from the average body type like myself to the well scuplt model types. At first, Mr. Kest voice might seem harsh, if compared to other instructors but this video is different, no wonder Mr. Kest is popular among the Hollywood crowd. It is thanks to people like Mr. Kest that yoga has enter mainstream America and has come out of incense burning aged-hippie's dens. I would even dare to say that it is a hip class and a workout all on its own.",1019779200,7,1363,4.226053639846743
7851837,5,6303534384,"If you are tired of your normal routine and looking for something different but yet challenging, this video along with Bryan Kest's Volume 3 ""Sweat"" video is GREAT! I am a former gym junkie who used to spend hours in the gym on the treadmill, in the aerobic studio, in the weight room, etc. After awhile, it gets old and you realize your body will not last forever if you do not take care of it. Yoga is so much better for your body and mind! Alternating Videos 2 and 3 have kept me as toned and fit as if I was in the gym! However, it is much, MUCH better for me physically and mentally.  Also, it is in the convience of my own home. Bryan does not use all the technical yoga terms, which I do not mind. What I do care about is that he definitely gives you an awesome workout. I consider myself in good shape and the next day I am sore after doing his videos! He holds poses long enough for you to get a good stretch and for your muscles to really work. Yet he moves quickly enough throughout the video so that you don't get bored. He has done a fabulous job in my opinion of putting these videos together. Another aspect I like is the fact that he stresses the importance of doing the best you can, and not judging yourself against anyone else. Sometimes my mom will do part of the video, although she cannot do it all, she feels at ease with his comforting comments that we all have different bodies and we must respect our limits and respect our bodies. Try it :) I think you will like it!",1018051200,14,1493,4.130584192439863
