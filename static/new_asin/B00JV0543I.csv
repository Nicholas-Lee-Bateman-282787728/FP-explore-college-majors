6390621,5,B00JV0543I,"Beautiful film. The dancing, acting and story were very well done.",1406505600,3,66,5.090909090909091
6390622,4,B00JV0543I,"If you love modern dance and like romantic backstories, this may fill the bill for an evening well-spent with a cuddly partner or bottle! Not a lot of new ground here. Newcomer, Ryan Steele is a talented dancer and whether by training or instinct, a good actor, at least in this role. He effectively communicates the anxiety, uncertainty and youthful, unconscious risk-taking of an 18 year-old breaking-into the hustle, bustle and pace of the big city as an artist in the uber-competitive world of dance. We feel for this character and we want him to succeed. Steele successfully portrays all the awkwardness and social immaturity of his character's age, but exudes a talent that betrays all of that. His dancing, and that of his co-stars, is interesting to watch not only because they are good, but having been taken behind the scenes into each dancer's 'struggle', we are in awe of just how they are even able to to do it. Performing artists are, for that reason, highly entertaining and curious, i.e., despite personal, known demons of internal and external origin, they are able to find that place within--again and again--of grace, purity and innocence and without any obvious constraints, give it up (in public performances, anyway) for the world to wonder, explore, discover and appreciate. I like that and I am forever fascinated by it.",1406419200,23,1344,4.951327433628318

6390625,3,B00JV0543I,"It was only an ""okay"" film.  My only problem was that there was very little character development. Aside from the bits we learned about Chip while he spoke to his mother. I never appreciated the characters. This movie had potential to be better than it was. Having said that, I did enjoy the dancing scenes. Thayer were nicely filmed",1405814400,3,333,4.6440677966101696
6390626,5,B00JV0543I,The naturalness of the performers and their amazing physicality work in combination with the minimalist dialog to keep Five Dances intriguing and worthy of the close attention required. It also shows the dedication to craft and serves as a paen to the work ethic required of dancers.,1405641600,6,283,5.042553191489362

6390628,4,B00JV0543I,I saw this last month at Frameline's 38th Annual S.F. LGBT Film Festival.  It's a very sweet coming of age story/character study with beautifully filmed dance sequences.  I enjoyed the acting and the story.  Recommended.,1405468800,,220,5.228571428571429
6390629,5,B00JV0543I,"Great Movie!  I am not at all into dancing, or dances.  Yet, this movie captured me and drew me in.  I was captivated!  And, I just noticed something.  This movie is made by Wolfe.  A lot of gay movies that I recently watched are from TLA release, where a lot of the main characters end up in a tragic death at the end.  This is the fifth Wolfe movie I watched, and that has never happened.  This movie had such a positive and pleasant end, and it is so refreshing!  FIVE DANCES .... FIVE STARS!",1481328000,,495,4.126315789473685
6390630,5,B00JV0543I,"It was a story about coming of age in terms of healthy separation from toxic parents, owning a call to live an art form that was within, seizing/risking a new opportunity without knowing how it would work & being unafraid to live the dream & finally a story of resisting then willing to grow into a sexual identity that was set free through love & relationship, not chemical induced promiscuity.",1475452800,,395,4.6571428571428575

6390632,5,B00JV0543I,This was not your typical movie that follows a specific script.  It was a movie about 5 people and how their lives touched each other while working on a dance project.  I thought it was very touching and played out well.  I liked all the characters and really enjoyed the movie from start to finish.,1469404800,,299,4.4

6390645,5,B00JV0543I,"This Alan Brown film, 'Five Dances', became an instant favorite for me and my family. A small town gay young man from Kansas enters the New York City scene rather scared. But slowly he makes friends in the tightly knit dance group he has joined. Some say there is not enough dialogue. But I disagree. Dance is one of the awesome universal languages. Without words, dance projects deep emotions of joy, passion, strength, sadness, rejection, etc. In this film, the dialogue is the dance! Ryan Steele is amazing. Alan Brown is a master.",1446595200,,534,4.752688172043011
6390646,5,B00JV0543I,I loved this movie.  My partner and I was immersed in the story and also the dancing which was better than paying to go see on stage.  Wish they had more movies like this one.,1445472000,,175,3.9714285714285715

6390654,5,B00JV0543I,"This film introduced me to new music by Gem Club and Perfume Genius that is beautifully wriiten. Gem Club 252 is the first song I have ever heard written around cancer and the vocals
Are truly incredible. Perfume Genius ""Put your back N 2 it""  concludes the film that portrays a beautiful visual to the few lyrics the song has on
Love. The choreography and screen shots of the dances articulate well the spirit of dance and how it is enriched when love enters into it. This film highlights in short episodes the struggle of life.  This film encapsulates the human condition of searching for meaning in all that we do whether if  love is found  or forsaken,  the human spirit digs deeper  to find  significance in a world that is forever searching.

6390661,1,B00JV0543I,This was much too graphic and should be more clear on the movie's theme. This is not to be watched by dancers who appreciate the art of dancing. This is more about sexuality than dance,1439510400,,184,4.285714285714286

6390663,5,B00JV0543I,"So many GLBT movies out there are so focused on terrible extremes: dreadful stereotypes, drugs, tragedy, death and betrayal.  This is not the reality of my life, nor is it the realty of most other GLBT people I know.  This is a simple and pure coming of age and first love story centered around the art of dance.  Beyond it's superb choreography and music it portrays a simple and innocent love that will make you remember the first time you truly cared about someone.

It made me smile. I hope it makes you smile too.",1438905600,,518,4.421052631578948

6390680,5,B00JV0543I,"This movie had beautiful dancing- really stunning. All of the dancers had very clear lines and sharp movements and it was a treat. I liked that it was very sparing on words- the stories were told with actions and expression, when someone talked I almost found it jarring. I really enjoyed it. The movie is fantastic dancing interspersed with small tidbits of the dancers lives and influenced by their emotions, so if you go into this expecting a feature film with significant plot you have the wrong expectations. Not to say there isn't any plot, but it is quiet in comparison to the dances and emotion.",1436054400,,603,4.69811320754717

6390683,3,B00JV0543I,it was pretty good but I dint like the color formatting they did for most of the part and I really didn't like the plot if they narrowed it down and added more scenes that were kind of suspected to come up,1435968000,,205,3.9047619047619047

6390685,5,B00JV0543I,"An honest, heartfelt film. It is poignant, slow, and allows you to feel every moment.

Not a blockbuster film; the intimacy of the characters and raw nature of the film will provide a relief from the expected, predictable, and doctored-up movies you will find in a theater.

It felt nice to enjoy Five Dances for everything it was. It was like being immersed in peaceful waters, with only the sounds of the music and script, totally engulfed in the beauty of this work of art.",1435536000,,476,4.588235294117647

6390687,1,B00JV0543I,I enjoyed the dancing but honestly didn't even finish the movie. the main actor seems to be struggling with his sexuality and the other male dancer in him have a dance piece together. there is a piece in the movie in the very beginning. that I was very uncomfortable with that made me feel like they were forcing him into a certain sexuality. I did turn off the movie after that so I don't know how it goes from there but just the point of how he was pursued forcefully I did not want to watch the rest of the movie. but the dancing was beautiful what little I did see,1435449600,,568,4.126126126126126

For the first third of the film the story line, acting, photography, music, and choreography are all quite well done for a production that was obviously not a deep-pocket's blockbuster.  As the story unfolds, it becomes obvious quickly that this is a gay romance film.  If that's your preference, then you'll likely find this enjoyable from beginning to end.  Giving all due credit to the fine efforts of all in the production, I must say that it became more involved in the romance/erotic  issues than we cared to watch, being more interested in the music and choreography; so we bailed out.  It's just a matter of individual taste.  For what it covers, this is not a bad film.",1433721600,,807,4.7214285714285715

6390712,5,B00JV0543I,"Two friends and I just finished watching the movie and were united in feeling this one is different than most.  An excellent job is done by the director/producer to keep the anxiety level up, yet there is no real massive drama.  What we see is a young man, Chip, that is in New York City from the mid-west.  He has no support from family, sleeps on the streets, is 18 and a beautiful talented dancer.  He joins a dance company whose job is to prepare a new dance.  In time they become his protector and family and love.  Extremely well done, the five dances are beautifully choreographed with amazing music.  We learn of real people and their real lives and they still do well.  A great movie that I would highly recommend...and I don't give five stars lightly.",1433116800,,761,4.463768115942029

6390715,4,B00JV0543I,"I really enjoyed this movie. As a dancer I could appreciate the actual movement. The choreography in my opinion -- though repeated quite often -- was beautiful. (In a rehearsal process there is MUCH repetition and this film captures that perfectly without it being too boring. Again, my opinion.)

I think the description may be a little misleading. It think the film focuses more on the microcosm of the dance world than him (Chip) trying to actually make it...which is why I feel most people are disappointed with the film. I didn't expect to see the nudity when I did, although when I did it made sense for what those particular characters were experiencing. I may have chosen a different location, but that's just a small thing. After all, the dance studio is where this 18-year-old is doing most of his discovering. That said, the film isn't about a new dancer trying to make it, as stated in the description. If it were there would have been a final performance of some sort. It seems that the main focus is Chip's personal development as the end of the film focuses on that. The dancing was just the vehicle to make that happen.

disinterested); for those of us who find the dance to be spiritually as well as physically  uplifting ,it is a true joy!!!

6390727,3,B00JV0543I,"Catherine Miller in the role of Katie was mesmerizing.  A natural beauty, I couldn't take my eyes off of her whenever she was in a scene.  My guess is that Catherine Miller is primarily a dancer who happens to act.  As beautiful a mover as she is, I would love to see her grace the big screen again and again.  To me, the film was a glimpse into a dancer's life; however, the film lacked a strong plot line to keep me highly interested.  Perhaps this is a typical problem when a movie attempts to shed light onto a relatively little-known world and its rituals; it focuses on mundane activities as if they are enough to keep the viewer engaged.  Understanding that a film's limited budget can ax bigger production ideas, I would have liked to have seen the Fifth dance as the final performance in front of an audience with lights, costumes, etc.  I'm unsure whether there was just one choreographer for these dances.  I would have loved to have five choreographers with distinctly different styles.  Frankly, each dance looked similar in style to me.  In fact, the five dances could have simply been five movements comprising the overall ballet.  These dancers were enjoyable to watch; however,  would have appreciated seeing them dance other styles.  Ryan Steele in the role of Chip was believable and understated, as were all the actors.  I valued their portrayals as being honest and vulnerable.  The role of the choreographer/company director, however, seemed a bit contrived and relied on stereotypes.  The end scene between the two male dancers was beautiful and poignant.  Lastly...I live in a studio apartment in the East Village of Manhattan, so I know what tight living quarters is all about.  When a movie character states that her apartment is small and there isn't much room, I expect to see two roommates sleeping in a walk-in-closet-turned bedroom.  I also expect to see a kitchen (if there is a kitchen) with a two burner hot plate and no counter space.  It irks me when movies and TV shows portray NYC apartments as palatial.  Folks, those are only for the top 1%ers.  Every sitcom that supposedly takes place in NYC seems to have its casts living in huge loft spaces.

The early plot was pretty good,  young boy trying to break into a professional dance team, on his own,sleeping in the streets until he could find a place to stay and yaddado he does typical starving boy makes good. The dance scenes were great,the choreography was real and there was some good interplay between troope members. But it got off synch with a very forced lieason between 2 men which to me did nothing. It just seemed to add nothing to the plot.  I would like to have seen more dance and leds

No home, not enough food or sleep but he prevails with seemingly endless practice.  He suffers from an abusive upbringing, distant father, drunken mother who is needy and selfish.  His youth has given him little social skills so interaction with his fellow dancers is awkward.  Likely never before having a boyfriend he is afraid to respond to advances from a fellow dancer but wants to experience it.  One female dancer befriends him and he begins to open up to her and then his suitor.  What I also found extremely interesting about this movie was the ballet and how very similar the practice of yoga is to it.  Do they practice yoga to become a dancer?  If you practice yoga as I do you might just like to see it for the similar poses and athletic dancers.  The ballet was beautiful and amazing.

6390867,5,B00JV0543I,"I've always been a big fan of dance. It's a rare combination of grace and athleticism. The five dancers in this movie are very talented people. They're accomplished dancers and actors. The plot should appeal to many. Many of us have been there and done that, only without the beautiful dancing. There were family problems, unrequited love, and the pure terror and pure happiness of first love.

Now in the spirit of full disclosure, like many gentlemen of my persuasion, I have become a follower of Ryan Steele. His name is what drew me to this movie. Portraying an eighteen year old could have been the one thing that really could have tripped him up, but he pulled it off. The fact that he looked eighteen didn't hurt. However, this brings me to a part of the movie I didn't understand, and that was ""The man in my mouth"" schtick. I had the same reaction as the character, Jackie. Although, it did make me laugh, so I guess it was somewhat successful.

This was a very beautiful movie. Be kind to yourself, watch this movie.",1428192000,,1026,4.54054054054054

This is the combine story of love and the love of dance.  Chip and Theo love in love slowly, as if all was expertly choreographed.  This is a slowly unwinding story of dancers rehearsing and learning their moves, while love develops.  This is an honest portrayal of finding love where it presents itself.  Chip and Theo have incredible chemistry as dancers and as a romantic couple.

Katie, while seemingly taking on a motherly role with Chip, probably has some smoldering romantic feelings for Chip as well.  Anthony and Cynthia add a bit of drama to the mix.

You have to enjoy periods of silence and nothing but dance movements to thoroughly enjoy this film.  It is spare and basic.  The dance segments allow the viewer to get inside the heads of the characters.

6390873,5,B00JV0543I,"This is Alan Brown's fourth independently produced full length movie and without doubt his best. I always rate indie movies differently from major studio films because of the many difficulties in making an indie film. Five Dances was made mostly out of good intentions, hope, and air. The result is a lot better than just good.

The movie began as just a concept of making a movie using dance as the major means of expression. Originally it was to be Seven Dancers, but Brown was only able to find five dancers that could both handle the choreography and also give a creditable job of acting. All the professional reviewers I have seen fault the acting ability of the characters. Considering that none of these people had ever been in front of a film camera before, they do a great job. And it had to be done in one shot because there was no money for the multiple retakes of scenes done in major studio movies.

The plot developed as making the movie progressed. There never was a real script. The choreographer Jonah Bokar was something of a prodigy. The five short dances he made show Merce Cunningham's influence as well as aspects of Paul Taylor and Pilobolus with much traditional ballet, and they are very, very difficult. The dancers learned the choreography in two twelve-hour days with no music or counts to help them keep in sync with each other. This must have been very hard because the dancers are often broken up into different small groups doing different steps and then seamlessly come back together in perfect synchronization. The film was shot at twice the usual frame rate so the dances could be slightly slowed at times to fit the music finally chosen. The whole movie was shot in four days. After months of editing, Brown once again pulled a rabbit out of a hat.

The gay content, including the sex scenes, is extremely sensitively done. You can see more skin on any public beach. The slowly developing love between the Ryan Steele and Reed Luplau characters ends the movie with surely the most ideal, genuinely beautiful gay date ever filmed. This is a keeper.",1425340800,26,2083,4.685792349726776

It didn't take long, however, to get caught up in the story and really appreciate the obvious talent of the dancers.  Five Dances was a pretty terrific love story that never became sappy; it was also downright erotic without ever becoming tasteless or offensive.  It's also pretty amazing that this was Ryan Steele's film debut...in my opinion, he came off as a truly polished professional.",1424649600,,549,4.571428571428571

I would love to see him in lots of things, he is that convincing an actor. the other 4 are equally terrific.

6390908,5,B00JV0543I,"All dance pays homage to Eros.  There are other gods it may invoke.  But no art is as carnal as dance.  Its meanings, no matter how abstract, must be incarnate.  And they must be musical,at the very least rhythmic, responsive to the human pulse, just as the measures of poetry are.

Five Dances is an original, innovative, beautiful, and above all lyric film.  At its heart is its invocation to love through the body's movement, if by 'love' is meant many things in addition to the sexual:  for example, the carefulness of touch, the suggestions of glance, the movements of arms and legs, and so on, in response to others' movements and touches and looks.  It is lyric because as much of the story is told through those movements, through dance, as by words.  In fact, the fundamental narrative of the film is in its choreography.  I don't mean just the five dances isolated by the number titles, but throughout the movie as the choreography is tested, rehearsed, changed, prepared for performance.

It is therefore a mistake to separate the ""plot"" of the film from the dance.  Rather, they weave in and out of one another, as the dancers do so often in their dancing.  How the dancers dance is affected by what has just happened or is about to happen in their lives.  Their lives are part of the continuity of the dance.  In the dance numbered three, for example, Chip is most isolated; he dances his solo.  In the one numbered five, Chip and Theo dance together and how they dance is now transformed by their having been together in other ways shortly before.

This way of living in and through dance is true for all four dancers, five if one counts the choreographer Anthony who is also part of his piece.  The movie shows not only the dances, of course, but all the other dancers watching one another.  The mirrors found in any dance studio play an obviously important part in this seeing.  The dancers see each other but also themselves.  This is perhaps most poignantly visualized at the movie's end when Chip and Theo happily, almost giddily dance for each other and for the mirror, seeing each other and being seen in a sense as the other sees him.  At this moment, they are dancing freely, with no choreography, yet the fullest expression of their new love for one another might be found in this rhapsodic bodily freedom.

The glimpses one sees in the movie of its dancers' lives are what their dancing expresses in other ways.  Look, for instance, how Theo and Chip lean back to back, as they have done several times previously, at the last realization of this passage in the piece.  But now the stance, the pressure, differ.  It is expressive in a new way.  Or note, earlier, after Cynthia and Anthony have had sex the previous night, how their bodies change.  It is not just her little mistake.  It is as much a matter of posture, of how the body is carried.  It is full of erotic expression, even in its failures, its errors, its disappointments.

Chip has a funny voice, a little man who talks when his mouth is closed.  At one point, he pretends to have swallowed him.  The voice is incorporated into him.  What one eats and drinks matters a lot, though it would appear superficially almost insignificant and off hand.  Twice Chip lays out a place on a counter top with spoon, knife, and fork.  One thinks of that gesture as an expression of a longing for a place at the table, which his whole life has lacked.  After he and Theo have been together, have become boyfriends, he celebrates with what looks very much like votive candles and a bottle of wine.  Life in this movie, in these superficially small ways, is ritualized.

This is, of course, how dance transfigures the body.  It makes it part of a rite of sorts, of art.  Love is similar in the way it turns the carnal into the sublime.  Such transformation is what any form of lyricism aspires to.  The movie takes place in winter, after Christmas.  Cynthia brings in her and her husband's Christmas tree lights.  They appear in the movie, wrapped around the dancers' bodies at night, in the darkened studio.  Once Chip is seen alone, his own body so lit.  In a way, this might be seen as a figure for how dance works in this film (and outside of it, too).  It is that illuminated body in a darkened room.

Chip begins alone, unsmiling, more than a bit diffident.  He has no place to live.  What the film stresses over and over, even while Chip, say, is dancing his solo, is how dance is itself always communal, the body never just the body alone.  Chip's discovery of happiness toward the film's end, therefore, is not just his alone either.  It is part of the dance.  It enters into it, as the dance has entered into him, the abstract (for the dance itself is an abstract piece, not a narrative one) united with the deeply personal.  It is an expression of the joy of no longer being alone.

Most films about dance have let the story, the narrative predominate.  In this way, they fail dancing.  But in Five Dances the story, the bits and snippets of plot and character that we see of the five people in it, are inextricably woven into the dances themselves.  This movie is not about life here and art over there.  It is about their simultaneity.  Save for a few documentaries, I think it is perhaps the best film ever made about dance.  As seriously it is a stunningly touching film, generous and compassionate, about how through art one comes to love and, perhaps for a while, perhaps for longer than a while, a human joy.",1410393600,18,5498,4.519796954314721

As beautiful as the dancing is, it would have been better had the director connected the dancing to the actor's story a bit better. Without doing that, what you basically have is 50% dialogue and 50% dancing that rarely connects to the dialogue. For me, the movie really didn't start moving until it was almost over.

However, even with the heartfelt vocal performances the underdeveloped storyline and character development diminishes the great potential of this film...sort of like a prequel.

The awakening is sweet, but as soon as the ""couple"" is established the film ends and there wasn't a lot of meat to the story beforehand. The most interesting episode may be happening after the movie ends and I wish we could have seen it.  The acting is natural and there is a great sense of being a fly on the wall, observing a private world.  The filming of the dances in rehearsal as well as the choreography is beautifully executed, but there is a severe lack of story and character development, save for Ryan Steele as the lead character.",1408838400,2,847,4.403846153846154

6390926,3,B00JV0543I,"""Five Dances"" stars Broadway dancer Ryan Steele as Chip, a naive young dancer from Kansas who joins a small New York modern dance troupe and spends his days in a SoHo rehearsal studio. The movie meanders along, with Chip eventually falling in love with fellow dancer Theo (Reed Luplau), the ho-hum coming-of-age moment.

The ""five dances"" of the title are brief sequences, each involving a different combination of dancers, all taking place in the same rehearsal studio.

The music is dark and brooding and the choreography by Jonah Bokaer is intriguing initially but eventually becomes repetitive. Steele is a superb dancer. The others pale by comparison and have sketchily written roles that relegate them to the background.

With such exquisite dancing, it's a pity that writer/director Alan Brown didn't provide a more solid script. I thought of ""The Turning Point,"" a film that exploited the backstabbing and jealousies of professional ballet in a riveting story with terrific acting (Shirley MacLaine, Anne Bancroft). ""Five Dances"" never approaches that level, but it does offer some expert dancing combined with melodrama.",1407715200,,1129,5.331460674157303

6390930,3,B00JV0543I,"As a gay man and a dancer, I really wanted to like this movie.  In fact, I fully expected to love it enough to want to spring for a buy.  Unfortunately, while all of the dance segments are beautiful and some are spectacular, the film as a whole doesn't live up to its promise.

""Five Dances"" suffers from a disjointed, wandering plot doesn't seem entirely clear where it wants to go -- it plays on a few dance-world tropes (the skeezy artistic director sleeping with his dancers, the young gay dancer from a broken home) but doesn't commit even to these.  It almost seems as if the creative team behind the film felt like it was somehow necessary to build in all these stereotyped sub-plots.

Dropping a few of the tropes (not every dance company suffers under a lecherous AD; the broken home backstory, meanwhile, doesn't really seem to contribute much to the overall plot) in order to focus on a central story might have improved the end result.

The central love story, meanwhile, is charming but weakly developed.  Strong acting performances from some of the cast suggest that a better script might have made a world of difference.  Neither fine production values nor excellent dance performances are able to rescue the film from its weak plot and spotty storytelling.

Instead, ""Five Dances"" comes across as a bundle of loosely-linked story-sketches coupled with beautiful modern dance performances.

I'm glad I rented it before deciding to purchase.  While I might watch it again at some point for the dance numbers, I'm not in any hurry.",1407196800,5,1544,4.8106060606060606

6390933,3,B00JV0543I,"The dancing is stunning.  The music for the dance sequences is wonderful.  The five performers are all very personable.  But the 'characters' and the 'story' are about as compelling as a blank sheet of paper.  What you get is basically 5 days in a rehersal studio while 5 dancers prepare for a performance.  Two of the young men find young lust/love in the duet the choreography gives them.  It's sweet and lite like bottled green tea, a real contrast with the very muscular intense choreography/dancing.  Without the dancing, the 5 days would have passed nearly without incidence, passing time with the idle activity of ordinary life.  Even the young lust/love would have been ordinary without the dancing.  Since this movie is essentially about dancing, it's too bad that the movie didn't follow on from the promise of the rehersals to a finale of its performance on stage.  That, in a sense, was the promise of the story.  It was all about the eventuality of the actual performance of the dance.  THAT was what the 5 dancers were ostensibly working their asses off for: to perform the dance for an audience.  THAT should have been the blow-out ending of the movie.  Instead, what we got was two cute boys doing a 'cute' little duet of cute gay romantic fiddling around.  Fine wine served with twinkies.  It trivialized all the extraordinary dancing we were given before.

With regards the dancing, there is one major aspect of the story that is too incredulous to be believed.  (Although the dancing itself is so potent that this 'problem' escapes notice at first.)  The Chip character is supposed to be 18 yrs. old, and is supposed to come from an extremely unsupportive family in Nebraska, one which obviously did NOT send him to dance class as a child, which DID send him to a military school where I have no doubt 'modern dance' was NOT an elective subject.  Where then did Chip acquire the astondingly prodigious dance technique that Ryan Steele so obviously has?  Technique is not an aspect of natural talent.  No untrained 18 year old from Nebraska could, by any stretch of the imagination, dance like Ryan Steele can.  With the dancing itself there is no need to suspend disbelief.  The dancing is real.  It was only after the dancing was over that I found myself considering the film as a 'movie', and disbelief came crashing in, and the movie broke down along all of its then obvious fault lines.  It's too bad the director/writer had to clutter up the dancing with such a trivial over worked gay story line.

I'm surprised that no other reviewer thought about BILLY ELLIOT as comparison with this film.  In a sense, the main character Chip is a kind of an American Billy Elliot, but he lacked Elliot's fierce drive, his fire.  That is what the film lacks; fierce drive and fire.  Cute and sweet are poor substitutes.  That the film 'goes nowhere' must, in the end, be seen as a commentary on the characters and their story.  Fortunately that does not infect the fantastic dancing.  See it for the dancing and forget the rest.
If I could rate just the dancing, I would give it an enthusiastic 5 stars.  But I can only give the movie a generous 3 stars at best.",1406937600,9,3173,4.657657657657658

Alan Brown did a bit of experimenting with Private Romeo that I thought was a beautiful gamble as well as with this.  The Reviewer who said that this is not for everyone was right, however, it was well thought out and although a little slow had a lot of hidden meaning.  The characters were great both in their acting and the positively beautiful dancing.  The expressions Ryan Steele showed on his face were priceless and made me want to fall in love with him.  The romance in this was very realistic and I felt satisfied when the movie ended.  I will be buying the dvd on this movie, It is a fine item for my collection.
