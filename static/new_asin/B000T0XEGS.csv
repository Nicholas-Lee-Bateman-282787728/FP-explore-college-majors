2891677,5,B000T0XEGS,"This is still the best dvd version of Traviata on the market.  I own five others, including, Netrebko, Fleming, and two with Gheorghiu, but none of those versions (which certainly have their strengths, both technically, and vocally) express the full gamut of the emotional power and the pathos that is at the heart of this great opera-tragedy.  It's all here:  Stratas, Domingo, and MacNeil singing and acting wonderfully; Zeffirelli's opulent movie staging [including a couple of unique treats:  1.) having Teresa Stratas made up to look like the classic portrait of the actual Marie Duplessis upon whom her character is based, and 2.) opening the movie with a scene that mimics the opening scene of Dumas' novel, wherein the late-and-lamented courtesan's effects are being carted away, after having been auctioned off to pay her debts].  Last, but certainly not least, Verdi himself seems to be guiding James Levine's baton.

This 2008 DG dvd copy of La Traviata (theatrically released in 1982) is obviously meant to replace the 1999 dvd (Universal Studios) version.  There are some distinctions, however, and they are not unimportant.  For one, the sound has been improved.  Two, the 1999 version was shown in widescreen (1.66:1), this one is fullscreen (1.33:1); it appears to me that the film was originally filmed in fullscreen and then clipped on the top and the bottom to properly fill a widescreen commercial movie screen (I've read that some directors like to shoot their films this way, and Zeffirelli must be one of them).  Be that as it may, a bit of the right and left edges of the 1999 film are cut off here, but there is more top and bottom displayed in this newer dvd [so, we're actually seeing more picture content, but--paradoxically--in a smaller area (4:3)].  Three, the ridiculous [bracketed] closed captions, indicating ""[laughter], [music playing], [finale], etc."" have mercifully been eliminated from this new version.  Four, the DG dvd is less expensive.

On the negative side:  even though the picture quality of this new version seems a little better than the widescreen version, it will never (ever) be mistaken for blu-ray, and two, there are (as with the 1999 version) some lip-syncing issues.  Lastly, although I think that this fullscreen version is slightly superior to the 1999 version, there is definitely something to be said for watching a film that fills your widescreen TV.  Enjoy!

UPDATE (1-2-11):  For what it's worth, I noticed that Amazon has lumped the reviews of all three video versions of this performance together (i.e., the 2008 and 1999 DVDs, and the older VHS).  It goes without saying, therefore, that any of the 80-plus reviews written prior to 2008 relate to either the 1999 dvd or the older VHS tape.",1242950400,89,2757,5.01978021978022

2891698,4,B000T0XEGS,"It's hard to beat Levine and the Met... It would be extremely difficult to find an orchestra that sounds better playing this music. As far as the singing goes, I'm not exactly a fan of Stratas. Although she has some good moments, she sounds too shrieky at times, and sometimes her intonation is not so good. Domingo is great, and the rest of the cast is fine.
The main thing I don't like about this production (besides Stratas's singing at times) is the cuts. Much of Alfredo's aria is cut out (including the entire cabaletta), and the same goes for Germont's aria and its cabaletta. Although I don't mind when repetitions of previous music are cut out, it is disappointing when more than that gets cut, especially from recordings.",1439424000,10,731,4.674418604651163

Both are enjoyable and have the same beautiful music and English subtitles.  However, this 1:37:1 version, released in 2008, loses some of the impact of the wider screen version of Zeffirelli's film, released in 1999.  I had seen parts of the 1.66:1 version when it was on YouTube, and that inspired me to order a DVD.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice the narrower 1.37:1 screen size when I ordered this version.  The focus of the images in this version seem less sharp than the wider version.  This narrower version of the film achieves its size by eliminating part of the rich images that Zeffirelli took.

2891725,4,B000T0XEGS,"As a part of the product review requested by Amazon, I stated that the DVD was well produced; and so it is. However, I would like to note the excellences of this version: superb staging, wonderful acting and solid musical values. But it also should be stated that while I admire Stratas for her emotional conviction and singing of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th acts, much of the 1st is questionable and in one instance genuinely distressing, Sempre Libre. Stratas appears to have little coloratura ability. Her phrasing of the aria is labored, the passage work unformed and not a little amateurish. I excerpted moments from this DVD for a talk on Traviata and always had to fade out this aria just before the final measures; it was just too painful to hear. Perhaps it was an off day in the recording studio but the sounds that emerge from Teresa's love throat are shockingly inept. But, again, the balance of the performance is excellent.",1405900800,2,930,4.676829268292683
2891726,1,B000T0XEGS,"This is the most involving, expressive opera production I know of. I saw it first in theatre and then while traveling through Northern Italy with 25 Clemson scholar-students. I carried a copy with me. With permission from the DG folks, I showed it on successive nights in Florence. All cried hard, boys and girls wept. We toured LaScala during the visit, which was Verdi's bicentennial and walked the streets by the site of Verdi's death hotel. The kids were awestruck and almost pilgrim like.
Best teaching experience I have ever had. It is great. Belongs in every collection. The only stage production that came close was in new Orleans with Dorothy Kirsten.

I got a package with one DVD only i return, and believe it or not, with the same zone code, the one for the US.
In the package was a note from Amazon, where they regret the inconvenience to me, but what does a regret help,
when the replacement DVD contains the same error as the first one I got?

Another point is that I bought, and returned 3 DVDs, and only got one replacement-DVD.",1392508800,2,589,4.166666666666667
2891729,4,B000T0XEGS,"This film looks stunning in the cinematic scope.  Sets and costumes are breathtaking and historically accurate. I love that Zeffirelli pays so much detail to research to create a very believable movie version of Verdi's great masterpiece.

 And the performances by Domingo and Stratas are wonderful (although she is not in her best voice). James Levine's conducting and the playing of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra are as good as you can hear anywhere. James Levine gets lush lyrical nuance out of the orchestra. The ballet is spectacular and well choreographed.

 But Zeffirelli cuts away at least one-fourth of the score. This annoyed me. Also for cinematic scopes parts of the score are repeated. He (and many other film makers who have made movies of operas) just doesn't seem to understand that a film of an opera is not an adaptation; it is a performance of that opera using a different medium. An opera is a musical composition; therefore, a film of an opera is a musical performance of a music drama. The film medium frees the visual presentation from the limitations of the stage, but the musical presentation is the essence of the opera and must not be compromised regardless of the medium. Some of Zeffirelli's were extremely annoying. For example, when Giorgio departs from Violetta after she has promised to leave Alfredo, Zeffirelli cuts some of the ""adio""s, saving just a few seconds but destroying the end of the scene.

However Zeffirelli's visual creation is so stunning that I forgive the cuts.  As much as I usually love Stratas, I would have preferred  if Zeffirelli cast another soprano,  possibly Natalie Dessay, Though a quite enjoyable production overall.

This film produced by The Metropolitan Opera can be enjoyed by any people even who is new to opera.

Teresa Stratas, Placido Domingo and Cornell McNeill are all excellent in their roles.

Great DVD.",1324512000,,236,4.85
2891750,5,B000T0XEGS,"Franco Zefferelli's 'movie' version of one of Verdi's better operas is one of the most accessible productions available.  Many people who do not appreciate or regularly listen to grand opera are titillated by the movie format and, once beginning the viewing of the story, are unable resist the plot and the beautiful music.  My daughters, many years ago when they were in grade school, got their introduction to this premiere art form from a VHS version of this piece, and still remember and talk about it.  The acting by Placido Domingo, Teresa Stratas, and Cornell MacNeil is very believable and smooth.  The movie does not contain all of the dialogue in the libretto, but the concept of the story and Verdi's music make this a wonderful first opera for nearly anyone.",1322179200,2,770,4.854961832061068
2891751,5,B000T0XEGS,"This is still the best introduction to La Traviata extant.  It remains a brilliant marriage of camera movement and music combined with a grand sense of spectacle.  The performances manage to bridge the gap between the scale of opera and the integrity of good acting, something audiences for live opera performances are now taking as a given.  Alas, it was not always so.  This film version of La Traviata went a long way toward convincing U.S. opera audiences they could demand and receive more from directors and singers.  It may even have convinced general directors and producers to exercise the same care in selecting a stage director accorded the conductor.  If so, this is a landmark achievement as well as an exhilarating musical experience.",1319241600,2,748,4.991935483870968
2891752,5,B000T0XEGS,"The brilliance of the singers shines in great virtuosic performances by Teresa Stratas and Placido Domingo at the prime of their great careers.  As always, James Levine  and The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus are unsurpassed.  The film's really unique quality is the production and direction of Franco Zefferelli. i.

2891753,5,B000T0XEGS,"Love, Love, Love this movie/opera! Zeffirelli makes opera come alive with his unique way of filming and Stratas, Domingo and MacNeill draw the viewer into their heartrending story. This is the movie that 1st opened the opera world for me several years ago when I saw it on PBS. Beautiful scenes in the country & on streets, as well as the lavish Parisian home, make one feel a part of the story, not just a spectator of a stage production. The english subtitles are the icing on the cake, enabling one to understand every moment of emotion & drama. I am so grateful to Franco Zeffirelli for the gift of understanding opera!",1299369600,10,623,4.571428571428571
2891754,5,B000T0XEGS,"I had a VCR of this performance, but it degraded over the years, and I have been looking for a DVD for a few years, but they, when available, were grossly overpriced.  I was overjoyed when I found this one at a very good price; I was a little concerned because this dealer is from England, and I think some DVDs are coded to only play in certain parts of the world, and I couldn't find any mention of that.

When it came I noted it is coded for worldwide use, and it was in perfect shape.  It arrived far before the promised date.

Some purists criticize this performance for some omissions and for being a film, but it is my experience that directors very often omit scenes from operas.  If such artistic license does not bother you, this is a valuable addition to any library.",1291507200,8,778,4.301369863013699
2891755,5,B000T0XEGS,"It is a beautiful production of a  wonderful opera. Zefirelli es a genius. For us La traviata is Verdi's best opera. Teresa Stratas and Placido Domingo are wonderful singers and extraordinary actors. What else can we say? A pure delight!

Stratas and Domingo are superb as Violetta and Alfredo, and the supporting cast as well.

Copies of the DVD are hard to find for low prices, so I suggest you snap at one the first
chance you get.

2891757,4,B000T0XEGS,"To begin with, Zeffirelli has done a hatchet job on the score. Almost half an hour of music is thrown out. That is unfortunate since the performance is quite admirable. Domingo is still a young man and of course sings gloriously. Cornell MacNiel is also at the top of his form.
  But the center of the production is Teresa Statas' Violetta. The woman is a superb acting singer. She deserves the mantle of Callas - and like Callas the voice is a little sharp. But she will break your heart. She concentrated on a few roles and thank goodness many of them are available on DVD - Salome, Seven Deadly Sins, Boheme. If you do not know this artist you are in for a great discovery.
  Four stars for her performance. It would have had five if Franco had kept his hands off the score.",1267228800,17,777,4.337931034482758
8207141,3,B000T0XEGS,"OK, we  all know Traviata is a great opera, but Mr. Z. plays around with a score that doesn't need it.  And he bitched Stratas' performance afterwards.  Her coloratura at this stage is not really good.  I saw her earlier in her career and of course she was beautiful and sang beautifully.  Though over-produced, the 3rd Act is exciting with the Bolshoi ballet stealing the show.  Stratas is also costumed beautifully and the camera work is exciting.",1525046400,,449,4.766233766233766

Shot like a film, on Location, in forests and amidst opulent sets resplendent with glittering chandeliers , velvet draperies, real candlelight and candleabrum, elegant solariums festooned with live hanging plants and flowers and gardens backlit by late afternoon sunshine . Such wealth and splendor can only be created by a Master like Zeffirelli. Plcido Domingo is younger , sexier and more romantic than ever and his vibrant but fading soprano, Teresa Stratas is the perfect consumptive tragic heroine but also a lively, gorgeous sybarite. No opera is as enchanting and unforgettable in this natural setting. If you want to introduce young people to opera this is a lovely way to initiate them to this wonderful world of tragedy, romance and amazing voice!",1516838400,2,851,5.406015037593985
