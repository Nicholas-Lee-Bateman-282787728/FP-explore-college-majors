7904948,5,B000006QJ7,"i've been a fan of Vincent's forever it seems. being 26, i only got heavily interested in him in the early '90s when USA and other cable channels would air his films late at nights. actually, i first saw Vincent doing a commercial for Tilex as i reported in an earlier essay/review. his movies came next, and after his death i read everything i could find in back issues of horror magazines (before the Internet came along). It happened in 1999...that was when i started to buy his movies at the video store and to date i'd consider myself a huge fan with lots of his movies. This A&E Biography was filmed/taped in the wake of Vincent's death. Roddy McDowell is on it and he passed away not long after Vincent did. I think it's a great Biography of an actor who never got any credit for his impact on the film-going audience. His horror movie image helped raise millions in numerous charities and art ventures that were built on his cinematic image. This program goes a long way to show the many different styles of Vincent's career: from melodrama, to stage work in local playhouses, the radio show ""The Saint"", numerous horror movies, and other projects including his one-man show as Oscar Wilde in ""Diversions and Delights"". they don't spotlight his commercials or the PBS show he hosted, ""Mystery!"", which Vincent had often said was the best thing he ever did during his later years. yet, it's a wonderful look at the Gothic Master of the Macabre and how his other interests like cooking and art kept him ""sane"" during all the horror hoopla in the '60s and early '70s when his Poe horror films were pulling in A-house money but were mostly restricted to B-house viewing. Roger Corman, Norman Lloyd, Victoria Price, and Hazel Court among others appeared in the tribute. A&E later repeated this biography on TV during 'Holy Bat-Week' in which Adam West served as ""host"" to a week long look at actors who played bad guys on the ""Batman"" series. Vincent lived a full life! He had all those movies, plays, radio appearances, TV commercials, a semi-regular spot on ""Hollywood Squares"", guest spots on many TV shows, voice-over work...he even had a hand in a few rock music projects like ""Butterfly Ball"", ""Welcome To My Nightmare"", ""Alice Cooper: The Nightmare"", and ""Thriller"". Price even tackled Gilbert and Sullivan: ""Ruddigore"", 1982. This biography is essential viewing for a glimpse at an actor who brought many laughs and chills to a generation or two of horror movie buffs.",1056758400,2,2479,4.7540603248259865
7904949,5,B000006QJ7,"As a huge Vincent Price admirer I loved this Biography. My only complaint is that is seemed so short. Of course I understand why (it being straight from the AE show w/out commercials). I literally had tears in my eyes at the end of the video, when it talked about his frail health, & his death. I recommend this video for anyone who wants to see what a great man, art historian, & actor looks like. You may want to supply your own box of tissues for the end of the video.",1032739200,2,471,4.130434782608695
