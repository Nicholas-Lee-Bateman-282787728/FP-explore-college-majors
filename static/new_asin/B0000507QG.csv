1385244,1,B0000507QG,"I think my title says it all. It was directionless and pointless. The only character that elicited any sympathy at all was Doug, and even he seemed to be drifting without any purpose. Even the gay issue failed to elicit any tension between the characters. I kept wondering when the plot would start, but it didn't",1064448000,,313,4.607142857142857
1385245,1,B0000507QG,"I bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that I never got past the first 20 minutes.  I am not a prude, but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective, verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff.  I put the video in my recycle box.  Maybe it had some substance, but I could not get past the first 20 minutes",1053993600,6,356,3.8493150684931505
1385246,5,B0000507QG,"Norman Reedus just might be the new River Phoenix in this sweet & heartfelt film. I personally liked the way the Writer didn't base this movie with a strong ""Gay Issue"", he kept Doug (Chad Lowe) in the closet to his pals & I love the way Van (Norman Reedus) finds out his new friend is homosexual. I sympathized with Doug in many ways, as from being out & seeing how a father can live in denial for so long. I felt the script as well as the characters themselves did a great job! My hats off to you, the makers & actors/actresses of ""Floating"". A must buy/rent!",1031356800,22,561,4.203703703703703
1385247,3,B0000507QG,"I had never heard of this movie before Amazon listed it on their welcome page as one of their 'Your Recommendations' for me. After looking into the movie, it sounded intriguing. I wouldn't call it one of my favorites, but I'm certainly glad Amazon suggested it. Despite a dark and sometimes tragic story, this movie offers some great moments of friendship, warmth, and humor. It's a quiet film that relies mostly on acting, setting, and an occasional surprise.",1001980800,10,460,4.910256410256411
7928822,1,B0000507QG,"I was hoping to buy this movie after watching it at a friend's house, but sadly, every copy I have found is ridiculously expensive  ($63, or more, for a DVD?!) simply because it's sold through a third party dealer? Great movie or not, it's not worth spending that much money to buy it.",1515110400,,285,4.377358490566038
7928823,5,B0000507QG,If you think you like Norman Reedus in TWD try him here as a sensitive  young man in this avant garde film. excellent film. Reedus is so much more than TWD,1475971200,,155,4.0
7928824,5,B0000507QG,"I was surprised at the sweetness and great acting. I was expecting a B rated second class movie that was overpriced for a glimpse at a A rated actor of now. What I found was a truley moving story and great acting. Truth today I'm currently collecting Norman's movie's but found Chads performance also fantastic. Together they were flawless, believable, sad. Thank you",1449532800,,367,4.841269841269841

7928826,5,B0000507QG,"I've seen this movie only once and sadly it was in poor quality, but despite the quality I really liked it. I love Norman his character Van, it definitely shows how young people can struggle with their parents, in love and on so many other levels. I've known many people who go through the same story as the main character Van and others that go through what Doug has too experience, a dad that always gives you a hard time even though you try your very best and nothing can make him happy. I think it's sad that this movie is so hard to find or way to expensive if you find it. It's a good movie and should be more known that just to those who'd seen it when it was in theaters or who accidentally came by it because they are Norman Reedus fans like myself and you absolutely want to see the movies he's played in. I wish I could see it again in good quality and even own it on dvd but I'm still not crazy enough to pay 100 dollars for it. If you ever have to chance to see it, buy it or if you own it.. watch it please, it's worth it.",1372032000,,1036,3.9617224880382773
7928827,5,B0000507QG,I watched this movie for free on youtube and would love to own a copy but I sure as hell am not paying 139 bucks for a movie.,1364774400,2,125,3.5
7928828,5,B0000507QG,"Norman Reedus is awesome in this movie. I love all his movies and might be slightly biased, but I would watch this one again and again.",1354924800,3,135,4.230769230769231
7928829,5,B0000507QG,"The movie arrived quickly and in great condition!
I'm a huge fan of Norman Reedus, so I was excited to finally be able to see one of his first movies. He's absolutely phenomenal. It's not the happiest story, but there's so many parts that I could relate to. I think it's a painfully realistic portrayal of a young man's struggle to find himself and cope with the challenges he's been thrown. One of my new favorite movies, despite the melancholy.",1340841600,3,446,4.5875
7928830,5,B0000507QG,"I was soooooo excited when I found this I had been looking at the original and it was like 60$, that was ridiculous!!!!

I was soo happy that I was able to buy this version, its that same awesome movie with a great plot and awesome characters!!! :D

This movie is great!!! I cryed when I watched it at some points!! :D It's amazing!!",1334880000,2,333,4.1875
7928831,5,B0000507QG,"I saw this excellent drama in TV3, here in Barcelona, where we have the option of watching movies in its original language or dubbed to our language, Catalan. I chose to watch it in English. I found this drama very well directed, with a perfect tempo in all scenes, a set of outstanding actors and a director and scriptwriter full of imagination. William Roth portrays very well  Van and Redus as a couple of troubled young men trying to make sense of their lives. It deals with many issues in a fine, sensible way. Homosexuality in particular is well presented. All patriarchs not accepting the homosexuality of their sons, should see this movie. Maybe it'll open their scandalized minds. Second, it proves that to make a good movie all you need is a good director, a camera, a team of good actors and an excellent script. Refreshing. I gives me hope that Hollywood productions are not going to destroy the excellent tradition of film making in the US.",1124064000,7,953,4.6726190476190474
