I had hoped to see at least some illustrations depicting St. Augustine's life, the time, the places he lived, some of his mentors, colleagues, etc. I was expecting something more than a person sitting at a table talking about St. Augustine. That being said, the presenter knew his material very well, had it well organized; and it was for me a very good lesson on St. Augustine. Had I known it was not illustrated, I would have bought it anyway, and I'm glad I did.",1425686400,,504,4.489130434782608

I would have appreciated a movie about St. Augustine.",1366934400,4,153,4.310344827586207
