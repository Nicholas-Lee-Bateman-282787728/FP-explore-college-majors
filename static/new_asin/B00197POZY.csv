3423765,5,B00197POZY,"I saw this film on tv.  So moving, incredibly powerful.  Very intimate and unblinking portrayal of parents fighting for their children's lives.  Loved it.

I thought it would be hard to watch, but I got completely engrossed after the first fifteen minutes and in the end, even though it was sad at times, I felt really good at the end, like I understood something new about human nature.",1222732800,3,387,4.647058823529412
3423766,5,B00197POZY,"I saw this documentary when it premiered on PBS over a year ago and it is by far the most touching, powerful documentary I have ever seen.  The documentary follows the lives of five children who have been diagnosed with cancer and are undergoing treatment.  The bravery and courage shown by each child as they fight to live in the face of adversity is absolutely awe-inspiring.  My heart broke for them and Tim, Alex, and Justin remain in my thoughts and prayers.  It is a documentary that will stay with you and make you appreciate life.  You will never forget these children or their families.  Highly recommended.",1216512000,6,616,4.710280373831775
8272283,5,B00197POZY,Saw this on PBS many years ago and so glad was able to purchase it.  Excellent documentary that helps put a lot in perspective and changed my life.,1485561600,,147,4.25
8272284,5,B00197POZY,This was a powerful presentation.  Love to all the families for sharing their stories.,1461110400,,86,5.142857142857143
8272285,5,B00197POZY,"This is a must see video.  Because of the law changes there will never be another Documentary that documents the reality of a child with cancer and more specific what the parents, nurses and doctors go through.  I am a little bias since I am in the film and Tim who is on the cover was like a son to me but being there while the filming took place I can tell you at no time did any of the 5 families ever ask Steve or Julia to stop filming.  So you are getting the real story here not a partial story.",1452729600,,501,3.892156862745098
8272286,5,B00197POZY,"This was one of the best documentary on Children with Cancer. It is an intense  and deeply moving film. It follows the lives of five American families who each have a Child battling  Cancer. You really get to know each Family , their struggles, the numerous encounters  between Parents and Doctors and the agonizing decision making process that come with experimental treatments. It really touched my heart and I will not look at life the same way and I will enjoy every minute with  my kids.",1429574400,,492,4.686046511627907
8272287,5,B00197POZY,"This is VERY FULL ON but an excellent resource for those who are studying to be a health professional - as well as their teachers.  Beyond this audience, anyone with an interest in paediatrics will enjoy it (although it is VERY challenging to see children die after very long and difficult battles with cancer).  I love this and wish I didn't lend it to a student who has not returned it :(",1429228800,,390,4.402777777777778
8272288,5,B00197POZY,"I first saw this film on a local pbs station several years ago. It shook me up so much and left such a lasting impression,I will never again look at childhood cancers and what their families endure in the same way. This is a hard film to watch,but if you can get through it,I guarantee it will change you.",1378771200,,305,4.186440677966102
8272289,5,B00197POZY,This documentary changed my outlook on life and sheds light on a subject people may not think about too often...especially if they have never had a loved one with cancer. Definitely a tear jerker but the documentary is amazing nonetheless.,1378684800,,239,5.0
8272290,5,B00197POZY,I watched this movie in a social work class and I just fell in love with one of the characters. I had to have the movie. It arrived in the time frame and was still in the wrapping.,1369785600,,180,3.763157894736842
8272291,5,B00197POZY,"What a truly remarkable and insightful documentary. You cannot remain untouched by this powerful human drama.  What i found equally fascinating was the choice of the Patty Griffin song played at the end of the documentary, ""When it don't come easy.""  You don't often see two mediums that are so alligned with each other.  It was as if the song was written specifically for the documentary or vice versa.  The haunting powerfull words of the song reaffirm the journeys of the people in the documentary. Whomever married the two together was so insightful.  An absolute treasure on so many levels.",1354752000,,595,4.91
8272292,5,B00197POZY,"Hands down the best documentary I have ever seen, solidifying my decision to become a pediatric oncologist. I would like to see them air this on PBS more often.",1317686400,2,160,4.551724137931035
