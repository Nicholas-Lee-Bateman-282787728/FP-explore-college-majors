8375658,4,B002NZK5MI,"[Minor Spoilers] The very amiable Shawn Hatosy (TV's ""Southland,"" TV's ""Animal Kingdom"") plays ""Brian Worthington"" who finally returns home, after 3 years, to see his family for Thanksgiving as if he's going to have a full-mouth tooth extraction without anesthesia (LOL).  But then it doesn't take the viewer long to see why after we, one by one, meet his quirky parents, oddball brother, newly divorced sister, and perceptive little niece.  His Dad especially can't seem to accept his children's transition to adulthood, but can Brian finally get that message through to him?  A true family treat (though Brian's relationship with his girlfriend seems to get lost in the shuffle and young kids may not be able to relate in general) with sincere familial moments that will feel all too familiar, in a good way, and a genuine sense that the filmmakers strove for perfection despite what was surely a limited budget, made all the worthwhile by some bitingly humorous one-liners from Brian's brother ""Kenneth"" (D.J. Qualls).  [FYI:  Watch for then-Virginia-governor (and now U.S. Vice President candidate) Tim Kaine being thanked in the credits, as the movie was filmed in Virginia in 2008.]",1470268800,,1188,5.166666666666667

8375662,5,B002NZK5MI,"A well-conceived, welcomed entry into a familiar indie category--the saga of the return home (or the place one grew up). There is the hilariously sarcastic twenty-something brother still at home with mom and dad and there is the single-parent sister rather daunted by the task of raising her daughter. Nice performances all-around-especially the father's role...Overall a warm and funny evocation of small-town life as well as quietly compelling drama of family dynamics that will seem all too familiar to many.",1267488000,2,511,5.4
