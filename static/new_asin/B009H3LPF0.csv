8541550,3,B009H3LPF0,"Before I am bashed, this is my opinion.  The DVD has good info, but the language is too strong to share with my kids and that was my purpose in making this purchase. Some of the artists such as Mc Lyte and Sway clearly articulated their opinions without all the f-bombs and the fact that many of the other artists interviewed didn't do the same was for me a disappointment. I think that teaching kids about business and marketing is very important and what better way than through an industry that has such an impact on their life. No, I'm not nave and I know my kids hear the language, but I don't want to perpetuate its use as a necessity to communication.",1430524800,,658,4.349593495934959

8541552,5,B009H3LPF0,"I thought this was a well produced documentary. I showed this to my high school film studies class and it generated a lot of discussion regarding the current state of the hip hop industry.  This film shows a realistic view of how the hip hop industry has changed since its conception.  Please note there are some strong language and sexual references mentioned in this documentary; however, it was necessary to illustrate because of the subject matter. I also liked how this film trys to end the seriousness of the subject on a positive note.  The actuality clips from Dr. Cornel West throughout the documentary were a added bonus for me! I strongly recommend viewing this documentary.",1379635200,,685,4.887931034482759

8541554,5,B009H3LPF0,This is the best documentary I've ever experienced concerning the Hiphop culture. Its true power and how that power is perpetually diverted by the momentary paradigm. Hip hop is a spiritual music and culture inspired by overcoming adversity through expression. This doc reminds me of hip hops potential and that reminding expands my awareness of what hip hop can offer to humanities consciousness.,1363996800,,397,5.317460317460317
