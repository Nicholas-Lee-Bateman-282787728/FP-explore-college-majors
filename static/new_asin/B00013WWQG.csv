8006182,3,B00013WWQG,"I was looking for a dvd of a virtual Christmas tree similar to all those virtual fireplace dvds, something I could show on the big widescreen TV that the cat couldn't climb. The tree is obviously a cheap fake one and sparsely decorated, although the shots when it is covered with real candles are kind of nice. As others have noted, the production is dark, probably because it was filmed with the room lights off, using only the tree lights as illumination. Could have been so much better with just a little more effort. It reminded me of the tattered Christmases when my children were young so I won't be too hard on it. You know how the tree ends up looking with 4 and 6 year olds in charge?

In addition, there were many other scenes featuring Victorian era Christmas cards, toys, holiday food, stain glass windows, even a Santa's eyeview ride in a sleigh drawn by a real live reindeer. These were often more interesting than the Christmas tree. Pleasant music. I wouldn't spend more than a dollar or two on it if possible.",1354665600,,1026,4.516129032258065

The Christmas trees (of which there are not very many) are terribly decorated, poorly lighted, and poorly filmed.

Spends a weird amount of time with extreme close ups of just the Christmas tree lights!

Stay away from this Christmas turkey!",1100131200,9,335,4.842105263157895
8006184,1,B00013WWQG,"This is so bad, the picture of the tree on the case is the best you will see, the dvd is filled with pictures of artificial trees, with poor lighting and some kind of chair rail in the background that they decide to decorate at the end, they zoom in on the fake branches and have very little decoration. It also does not mention this, but is filled with strange scenes, such as a bird in a plastic birdbath and pieces of tissue paper. It's so bad, it's comical.",1098489600,11,461,4.191011235955056
