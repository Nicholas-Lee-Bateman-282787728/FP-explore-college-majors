8331805,5,B001P1FTFO,Just the thing to put me in the Christmas spirit. I didn't even know this version of Miracle on 34th street existed. Loved it.,1357084800,2,126,4.291666666666667
8331806,4,B001P1FTFO,"First off I loved watching the history in these films and they have great acting/story lines.  But when I bought this I thought it was the ""Miracle on 34th Street"" but it is a 45 min tv version that follows the storyline very closely.  At first it was hard to tell that it wasn't the version I was hoping for.  Honestly great classical cartoons, good selection of older christmas tales that time has forgotten.  It is a great choice but don't be fooled by the titles as they were used multiple times.",1301443200,5,500,4.4021739130434785
