The anime industry would do well to remember that judicious policies like this do not provide any support for their cause or serve their customer base: It only serves to encourage video piracy, which is in none of our interests.

8685209,5,B00OWHZ8ZO,"I'm a HUGE Patlabor fan!  This set finishes off the Griffin story line.  My only complaint is that only the first 4 episodes are english dubbed (included in the disk #1 special features), but at least those were the ""Griffin"" episodes.  Usually I'll say that the sub is more true to the story, but the cast that did the dub for this series did a great job, and every other previous Patlabor release from MaidenJapan had the english sub & dub so I'm going to miss it.
This is still a great buy for anyone who enjoys a fun story or a good anime, even if you have to do a little reading.

For those who recognize the name Masamune Shirow, this effort is not as gritty as ""Tank Police"" and nowhere near as serious as ""Ghost in the Shell"" or ""Appleseed"".  But as in all these titles, somehow he makes every single character in the series real, alive, and personal to the audience; and does so without ever directly describing or defining who they are!  By the end of an episode, you just seem to know them.  The director did a great job maintaining character integrity throughout the TV series.
By the way, this is the finally for the TV series, it follows the TV series canon; the movies will follow a slightly different time line.

PARENTS:
(SPOILERS in description.) The TV series so far has been pretty safe for the kiddos, especially for an anime.  The first three collections of this series only hinted at debauchery, with occasional mild tongue in cheek.  But in this forth collection the stories turn much more teen after the forth episode.  For example, Episode 7 has the guys fighting nude in a bathhouse (tastefully covered by black dots), in episode 8 female topless images are briefly shown as the unit destroys/burns a large collection of pornography that they/themselves had collected, and in episode 12 the typically calm and collected Captain Goto struggles with the temptation to assault a sleeping female coworker, (It is hinted during the series that the two share an unrelented mutual attraction, but thats no reason for Goto to act like a letch (my opinion, take it or leave it)).

The action violence portrayed is appropriate to each story relative to a police drama.  Sorry teetotalers, there is some (but rare) comedic drinking.
If you like the occasional rough, slapstick humor portrayed in this series, I recommend ""Tank Police""; its pretty silly and a lot of fun.",1429401600,,2386,4.679425837320574
8685210,5,B00OWHZ8ZO,"Great addition to the tv series. For a few years this set was selling around $150! Really appreciate this re-release ($30-35). If you're new to the series this isn't the place to start. If you're not new then this is more of what you already enjoyed in the tv series.

This set ties up the Griffon arc in the tv series and is more of the same hijinks. After the arc the show's tone is far less serious...as it gets really silly in a few parts but still good. You also see a comeback of another minor character. So if you're new start with the tv series (not the ova although it's cool to watch too) then visit this set. New files picks up right where it ends.

People may disagree with me and that is okay...but the tv series starts off slow. It isn't until around 20% or so into the series that it hits its stride so give it a chance if you're not into it at first. My opinion. Not really a mecha/action show. More like an around-the-office comedy/drama with some mecha/action happening on the side. Really down to earth and realistic characterizations. Anyhow, if you're already into Patlabor and refused to pay the ridiculous prices on this set before...now you've got a reasonable option.",1425427200,7,1192,4.463302752293578
8685211,5,B00OWHZ8ZO,"The Patlabor Blu-Rays are a fantastic presentation of the original animation. It's very hard to accurately explain the series, but I enjoy it a lot. A motley police crew run a robot squad to protect from criminals that would steal robots for their own destructive aims. There's a mix of action, suspense, humor, a little bit of drama,  a tiny bit of politics. It's relatively subdued, it rarely seems forced or excessive.",1425254400,2,421,4.847222222222222
