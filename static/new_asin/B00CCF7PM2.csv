Two working class British activists are sued by McDonald's for a pamphlet they put out accusing McDonalds of making unhealthy foods, exploiting its workers, etc. Under the archaic British libel laws, all the burden of proof is on the defendants, and somehow these two plucky, broke (if occasionally annoyingly nave) nobodies fight McDonalds to a stalemate in court, while costing McDonald's millions in legal fees, and causing them an absolute PR disaster.

While the story is terrific, the re-enactments, especially of the courtroom scenes are awkward, and the over simplistic idealism of some of the couples' political theory (`why can't McDonald's simply give half of it's profits to their workers?') can be a bit much to take.

Still, it's good to see something that makes you realize the little guy can win now and again. Worth it for
that bit of uplift and inspiration in a cynical time.
