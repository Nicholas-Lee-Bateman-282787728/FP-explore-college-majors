8311348,5,B001ISOL6C,"I have been a follower of Jane Fonda exercises for 3 years now.  BUT now I am a lover and follower of Mirabai Hollands dvd's.  A bit more of a challenge,  and that is what I needed.  I also bought level 2.  Am going to do level 1 from now, Oct to Dec. 31,  6 days a week, and then in Jan 1, will do level 2.  Can't wait!  Jane is great, but Mirabai is better!",1507852800,,359,3.6315789473684212

8311350,5,B001ISOL6C,"I'm really happy with this particular product.  It's great for those of us who are getting back into exercising after an injury.  The exercises are easy but not too easy and all in all a very pleasant and relaxing experience with the ocean background and very nice music.  The instructor is great, very personable and encouraging.  I've been doing one full set of these exercises every day for several weeks and I've noticed an improvement in my endurance, my posture and my balance.",1464652800,,483,4.783132530120482
8311351,3,B001ISOL6C,was hoping to use this series as part of our senior workout in our resort.  Most of it is much too difficult for our class of 80ish folk.,1464393600,,137,3.892857142857143

8311353,4,B001ISOL6C,Great DVDs for the beginner!!!  Mirabi is so encouraging and easy to follow. No difficult to follow aerobic routines here!  Love that you can choose the level of difficulty.  I purchased the set of 4 DVDs to change up the routine. Highly recommend this product. Once I master these levels I ll look for more of her DVDs.,1408752000,,320,4.482758620689655
