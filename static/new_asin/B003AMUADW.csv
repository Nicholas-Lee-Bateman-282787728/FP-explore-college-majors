8393049,5,B003AMUADW,I really enjoyed watching this movie. I have watched many bollywood movies are really enjoy them. Umrao Jaan is one of my favorite movies even with the sad ending.,1350086400,,163,4.655172413793103
8393050,3,B003AMUADW,"Lavish costumes, jewelry sets, henna painting, and interior designs recreate the splendor, refinement, and decadence of 19th century Lucknow, and the unfortunate life of Umrao Jaan Ada, the tawaif immortalized so brilliantly by Urdu writer Mirza Hadi Ruswa. Whether the dancing beauty was a real historical person or the figment of Mirza's imagination matters little, since the trials and tribulations of this well-known literary character plausibly echo the life of many a courtesan living off the fickle generosity of former respectable nawabs and wealthy scoundrels. For Westerners, this movie is a glimpse into the exotic India, its beautiful music, exquisite dance, poetry, and mannerism, a lesson on the social conditions and norms surrounding the life of these expensive and much-praised social outcasts, and an illustration of the virtues of accepting one's wretched fate in hope of better reincarnation. The movie is worth watching for its celebration of beauty, in spite of the rather one-dimensional acting skills of Rai and Bachchan.",1348790400,,1045,5.5375
8393051,4,B003AMUADW,"As a sort of a novice viewer of both Bollywood and Indian/foreign films in general, this is, hands down, one of my favorites. While I have not seen the original version, and being that I'm usually against remakes and most sequels, I feel quite strongly about this remake. I love it. And I continue to revisit this movie for the pure pleasure of the story, the costumes, the songs, the performances in general. I really can't say enough about it. It's wonderful!",1322524800,,461,4.634146341463414
8393052,5,B003AMUADW,"It is a great and sad story. I love bollywood even though i'm hispanic, Aishwara Ray and her husband make a great couple on and off the screen.",1314144000,5,143,4.142857142857143
8393053,5,B003AMUADW,"I became addicted to Bollywood movies and this is my second movie I have purchased.  I fell in love with it.  The dance sequences are amazing.  The detail to the costumes is spectacular.  The film crew captured the essence of the time period.  I highly recommend this movie, although it is a love story with a sad ending, it is love story and depicts how strong a person can be to endure.",1307491200,4,388,4.333333333333333
