8122092,5,B000FGFBMG,Love this movie and great quality.,1472774400,,34,4.833333333333333
8122093,5,B000FGFBMG,"A bargain selection of fun themed movies.  The Cold Equations deserves pride of place, but the others aren't bad either.  They make for a good popcorn night!",1467072000,,157,4.777777777777778
8122094,4,B000FGFBMG,"Good movie.  Not the best, but I liked it.  But again, I usually like any fair movie with flying involved.",1392076800,,106,4.25
8122095,3,B000FGFBMG,"Clearly a secondary (or B) picture, with acting not in contention for any award from anybody, technically inferior to the many 'plane in trouble' forbears, yet still able to generate interest with its stripped down version of 'nefarious elements seeking to kidnap a wealthy young woman through capturing her plane in transit'. If you are prepared to watch Sabato, Jr. and not John Wayne or Harrison Ford face the problem of seeing that the Evil Forces or the damaged airplane do not deter a safe arrival home, you might find this one sufficiently entertaining to justify the 90 minutes.",1374192000,,586,4.929292929292929
8122096,3,B000FGFBMG,"Antiono Sabato, Jr. plays Major John Master, who is hired by a billionaire to go on a private plane with his daughter and a couple of her friends, but plane is overtaken by terrorists who pose as flight attendents to hold the billionaires daughter for hostage. Things spin out of control resulting a wounded pilot, several dead, and severely damaged plane. After disposing of terrorists, it's up to Master to land the plane on a small Pacific island where a catagory five hurricane is approaching  the island. Michael Pare plays a small part as Captain Williams stationed on this island with his men. In order for the plane to land, Capitain and his crews must finish a runway before the hurricane hits.",1363737600,,703,4.762295081967213
8122097,1,B000FGFBMG,"My complaint here is the obviousness of cheap production values. If you didn't grow up on computer-generated ""action"" games, then the pathetic simulation of a flying aircraft, electric storms and crash landing, blended with real people, is just too distracting and off-putting to be enjoyable. The obvious explanation for this is a low-budget. The cheapness of production is so in-your-face that I bailed after about 5 minutes. What a rip-off. This movie is plainly intented for a demographic mega-accustomed to computerized crap.

In the 1930's such crap-quality special effects would have relegated this film to worse-than 'B' status. This is no ""High and the Mighty"", ""Executive Decision"" or other first-rate airplane disaster flick. They didn't even try to achieve ""Titanic""'s computerized excellence.",1306022400,,805,5.598360655737705
8122098,2,B000FGFBMG,I purchased Crash Landing through Amazon that took three weeks to get to me in Wales UK. I was excited to recieve it but then after realizing it would not play on my dvd player and the only way we would be able to see the movie is by putting it on my laptop and using a HDMI cable into the tv..... a bit of a nuisence having to do all this and will view it in time as we have not had the chance do so as yet. Is there a way of changing this setting?,1292976000,,449,3.6391752577319587
8122099,4,B000FGFBMG,This was a movie I had never seen before purchasing it.  I liked it.,1254960000,,68,3.857142857142857
8122100,3,B000FGFBMG,"""Crash Landing"" is yet another direct to video action flick from director Jim Wynorski(who also uses the alias Jay Andrews).  Like most of his other films, this makes for good entertainment for the non-discriminating viewer.  Also like most of his other films this one has a pretty solid second-string cast.  ""Crash Landing"" boasts Antonio Sabato Jr. and Michael Pare as the top billed stars(though Pare really isn't given much to do).
The plot is pretty straightfoward.  Sabato is given the job of escorting a billionaire's 22 year old daughter and her equally ditzy friends on a private plane to her birthday party.  Before the flight departs, hijackers kill off the crew one by one and secretly take their places.  Scarily enough no one notices until after the plane has already taken off.
The hijackers plan on holding the billionaire's daughter for ransom, but unfortunately for them they didn't know Antonio is on board.  He's not willing to give up without a fight.
Although ""Crash Landing"" is full of plot holes, it's still entertaining.  The plot moves along nicely and is filled with just enough twists and turns to keep your interest.  If you can look past a few unconvincing visual effects of the plane(and I've seen much worse) you might find ""Crash Landing"" to be exactly what it was meant to be: an hour and a half of harmless entertainment.",1184457600,11,1356,4.860869565217391
