8053324,4,B0007XBKYU,"A good British series, oddly enough, about a beauty salon in Manchester.  Chock full of enough attractive men and women to keep the series going for four series.  Jason Merrells is the very handsome owner of the salon, and he runs it with his wife.  As one might expect, the salon is full of intrigue and in-fighting.  Hearts are broken, affairs are carried on, and jealousies abound.  Nicely photographed and the stories are written well enough to keep one interest.  Only available, as far as I know, in Region 2 format, so you will need an all-region machine.  Hard enough to find for a reasonable amount.  Must be a sort of cult classic in Britain.",1437350400,,652,4.608695652173913
