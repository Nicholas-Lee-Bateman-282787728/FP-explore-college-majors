It was magnificent, as always--Gackt always gives 110% to his projects. That being said, I watched the rest of the series, and I'm completely hooked! I'm surprised that it ran for only one season. The cast is marvelous, and the storylines always have an interesting twist. I recommend this to fans of police drama that includes a touch of humor. A very good series. Five stars.",1417478400,,514,4.8522727272727275

For fans of Takuya Kimuya, this is a relaxing one.  Don't expect too much on the stories, many things about neuroscience and brain science had been mentioned similarly in Fringe...",1365897600,2,248,4.880952380952381
