I liked ""hope and Glory"" a lot and was fascinated by seeing the Blitz through the perspective of a child's eyes; but the late adolescent pranks of the character in this later iteration provided nothing on which to hang one's interest.

If you appreciate the quirky, bittersweet movies which the United Kingdom makes so well, I really do recommend this and its predecessor ""Hope and Glory."" It's not necessary to see the first film but, if you have, you'll have a much better insight into how the characters and really, post-war Britain got how they were.

6898046,3,B00R244FN0,"Compared to ""Hope and Glory"" pathetic.

Bordering on incestual at times, it was very uncomfortable.  And I don't believe anyone loses their accent that much after only 9 years.  Terrible casting.  I can't believe that one of the photos used to advertise the movie on here is actually Bill and Dawn looking like lovers (the one with the girl in the yellow dress above Bill...yes, that is supposed to be his sister).  Really bad decision on someone's part.",1457654400,,563,4.802083333333333

6898053,3,B00R244FN0,"Writer/director John Boorman set a high standard for his war memoirs with his beautifully scripted and acted HOPE & GLORY in 1987. That original bears little resemblance to this off center amateurish sequel QUEEN & COUNTRY. We wonder where the wonder went.

In the hilarious highlight of HOPE AND GLORY 9-year-old Bill Rohan rejoices in the destruction of his school by an errant Luftwaffe bomb. QUEEN & COUNTRY picks up the story nearly a decade later as Bill - Boorman's alter-ego - (Callum Turner) begins basic training in the early Fifties, during the Korean War. Bill is joined by a trouble-making army mate, Percy (Caleb Landry Jones). They never get near Korea, but engage in a constant battle of wits with the Catch-22-worthy, Sgt. Major Bradley (David Thewlis). Richard E. Grant is their superior, the very, very, infinitely put-upon, aptly-named Major Cross. The boys begin noticing girls (Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Vanessa Kirby  Bills sister - and Tamsin Egerton) but that does little to help this thin plot.

Boorman is responsible for it all and though it has a few nice moments, it is a cake that falls. Grady Harp, January 16",1451606400,,1136,4.968421052631579
6898054,3,B00R244FN0,"Disappointing Boorman film, especially as a ""sequel"" to the superb ""Hope & Glory"".  One never really cares about the principal characters or their experience.  Wish I could say otherwise.  Almost every preceding Boorman work has been so memorable.",1449100800,,247,5.447368421052632
6898055,4,B00R244FN0,"It wasn't until I read more about Boorman that this film finally popped into focus:  it is to a certain extent autobiographical. Nevertheless it is well acted, directed and filmed with a backdrop of early 1950's England not often portrayed in film.",1448323200,,248,4.904761904761905
6898056,3,B00R244FN0,Boring story drags.  No real romance till towards the end of the movie.,1448236800,,71,4.461538461538462
6898057,2,B00R244FN0,So disappointing. His earlier film Hope and Glory is one of my all time favorites. This sequel was not,1447286400,,102,4.421052631578948

6898061,2,B00R244FN0,"This is a real let-down when it's billed as a sequel to the very fine (5 star) ""Hope and Glory"".  The main characters are poorly cast, and the story line is sorely lacking.

6898062,5,B00R244FN0,"I'm not quite ready to write a full review yet, but I felt it was important to note that John Boorman is NOT dead! Rather being his ""last"" film, it is his ""most recent"" film! Boorman also directed ""Deliverance,"" ""Excalibur,"" and others.",1443916800,3,236,4.642857142857143
6898063,1,B00R244FN0,Not happy with this product. Stated the rating was TV-14 and with in first few minutes there was heavy swearing that should have been rated TV- mature. Stopped watching right away and want money back,1442016000,4,199,4.714285714285714
6898064,5,B00R244FN0,"John Boorman's follow-up to 'Hope and Glory' memorializes his two-year conscription service in the RMS from 1952 to 1954. We see the final, exuberant scene of 'Hope and Glory,' and then are transported from the 10-year-old Bill viewing life during WWII to life 9 years later. This is a coming of age movie, not just of the young John Boorman, but also of the UK, post-WWII, from King to Queen, as well as the whole of the world, as young conscripts are sent to Korea in the 1950s. Though not quite as glorious as 'Hope and Glory,' which I first watched with my mum, also a child survivor of the Blitz (it is her absence I feel, maybe, as well as the other female actors from the first movie -- but how could Sammi Davis or Sarah Miles possibly play themselves as a young adult or aging mother 34 years later), this is another excellent heartfelt film from the great John Boorman growing up across the river from Shepperton Studios to become one day the director of 'Deliverance,' 'Hope and Glory,' 'Beyond Ragoon,' and now 'Queen and Country.'",1442016000,7,1043,4.553191489361702
6898065,5,B00R244FN0,"This was Director John Boormans 2nd autobiographical film (the first was Hope and Country, which Ive not seen.). It was also his last film.

Boorman (and his on-screen character) was a kid during the World War II years of the first film. Now he has just turned 18 and is drafted into the British Army in 1952 during the Korean War.  He is not sent to the front but teaches a typing class. This was also the time when King George V died and Queen Elizabeth because the symbolic ruler of Great Britain. Times were changing in culture and morals. But on the army base everything was still by the rule book.

This is a coming of age story written and told by the man who lived it. There are no battle scenes and most of the action takes place on the army base where draftees (conscripts in England) are trained. (By the way, the camp was built from scratch in Romania for economic reasons. )

Yes there is some nudity (a few seconds of a breat) and a few expletives.

I knew nothing about the plot going in and I loved the film. I could really emphasize with the characters.

The DVD does have an excellent bonus feature. A 24 minute behind the scenes  featurette includes Boorman talking about his life and the film and comments from most of the cast members. I found that it added a lot  especially if you enjoy the film. But don't watch it till after seeing the film.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6898066,1,B00R244FN0,Today's values imposed on 1950's England...not my cup of tea. Siblings have a relationship bordering on incest. Gratuitous sex and nudity. A movie obviously meant to entice it's viewers. Sorry I wasted my time and money.,1441411200,9,220,5.138888888888889
6898067,4,B00R244FN0,"Writer and director John Boorman introduced us to some of these characters back in 1987 with the marvellous war time tale - `Hope and Glory'. Bill is now ten years old and has been sent off to do his National Service - only we are now involved in the Korean War (which still limps on to this day - peace never having been formally agreed). He and his mate Percy though end up stuck in base camp teaching the typing pool.

Life in the camp is far from fun and games and the strict Regimental Sergeant Major and Sergeant Major make their life a bit of a hell - so they create diversions, shenanigans and go chasing the girls near the base by way of diversion. However, as with all diversions - whether on camp or elsewhere - there will be consequences.

Now this is a very well made film, period detail is great etc. The make up is all good and the acting is generally very good. Caleb Landry Jones as Percy Hapgood though struck me as miscast - his accent is unplacable (perhaps as he is American?); he does the emotion well but seems a bit unhinged - which may indeed have been the point. David Thewlis is probably the most stand out performance as the irritatingly unlikeable Bradley - and shows how broad his acting abilities are. Overall though a very good film and if you were a fan of the original, then you will probably want to see - but the jokes are much thinner on the ground here, but it still has a vibrancy that evokes the time and the passion in an endearing way.",1440633600,12,1477,4.271428571428571
