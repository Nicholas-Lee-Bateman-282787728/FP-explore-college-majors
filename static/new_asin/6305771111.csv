Jayne Mansfield provides nice support. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I do aqppreciate her support for women's and gay rights. One of the living legends of the golden age of Hollywood.",1381104000,3,358,4.279411764705882
1079580,3,6305771111,"First a note that Amazon groups ALL releases of a film together and you will see reviews of DVDs going back to 2001 here. I always recommend to folks that they sort reviews by ""newest first"" and note the date of the review. This one is the 2013 DVD release from VCI - but it uses same UPC code# as prior release and has different cover image.

VCI Entertainment has released this 1966 film on DVD in the past and this release is listed as ""remastered"" on the package. It's been years since I watched the earlier VCI release but, honestly I don't remember it being that poor and there are some ""dark"" moments in this version.

As others pointed out in previous reviews this film will be of interest to ""classic country"" music fans because of the appearances of Connie Smith (in 1966!, Bill Anderson, Del Reeves and Sonny James (whose name is covered on the package front by the words ""15 songs""). The performances show up in three sections, one performed in front of an audience (where it appears the singers are not lip-synching) and the other two, obviously lip-synched, but still fun. Most - not all - are full performances.

Yes, both Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren are here. Mansfield is so overdressed that you'll never see her hour-glass figure and Van Doren seems more mature than there sex-kitten image, though she does get to sing a number.
The plot is dumb, just plain dumb.

The only bonus on the new DVD is a 14 minute string (no chapter settings to skip to next) of trailers for other VCI releases - including very early films starring (and produced by) Jack Nicholson and an early Truman Capote prison film starring Alan Alda.

Speaking of ""chapters"", I think VCI missed the boat this time by not setting up the ""chapters"" on the disc to allow viewers to jump to the ""15 songs"".  With almost 45-minutes of legendary country stars performing (okay, maybe not Van Doren's pop song), this would have encouraged purchased by those who own earlier editions. As it is, you'll have to scan forward to get to them.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

1079581,1,6305771111,"This a dreadful example of what Jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat-husbands/lovers.
The only reason to watch it would be because Mamie Van Doren was also in it. But be aware (and i read that in a biography about Jayne) that in their contracts was specified that they would NOT appear together in ANY scene whatsoever. So you see them SEPARATELY in different scenes. Also be aware that if you blink,you will not see either of the 2 blonde beauties.
Conclusion:Get this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ''Ol' South',or someone with a white hood showing his eyes only",1166745600,2,672,4.516393442622951
1079582,5,6305771111,"This DVD is worth the money just for the great ""Sonny James"" & the brilliant ""Del Reeves"" both singing a couple of their mid sixties singles. The other singers are a joy to watch with the possible exceptions of the two 50's sex bombs Mamie & Jane. I just skip to the songs & watch it in about 20 minutes.",1142380800,,304,4.083333333333333
1079583,1,6305771111,"The Las Vegas Hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars Jayne Mansfield, Mamie Van Doren and Ferlin Huskey. It appears to be a low budget film due to the photography, acting and settings. If you are a Jayne or Mamie fan, you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only. One highlight of the film is Ferlin Husky's dream sequence of Jayne singing ""That Makes It."" Air time of Jayne is very small. Trivia: the Siamese cat in the film, which Jayne is holding, belonged to Jayne's friend May Mann.",1132099200,3,510,4.615384615384615
1079584,5,6305771111,"Listen up ya'll. If you enjoy a movie with good down home mannerisms, easy speaking rural folk, and a plot that's thinner than a Southern fried possumn tail, than this here moving picture is just right for you.
Shucks. You get the same two leading men from the Hillbillies in the Haunted House movie, plus Mamie Van Doren. Jayne Mansfield may have clocked in at a whole 10 minutes in this film. She's saved by our kindly southern folk after she breaks down on the highway, she sings a song in a dream sequence type setting, then she stands at the roulette wheel and that looks like stock footage.
To watch the film the whole way through is as painful as putting your nose to the lips of a large mouth bass. The country songs and 'stars' that perform are enough to curdle grandma's buttermilk. Whew boy, if you like being tortured by honest good time cinema, step right up and go to Vegas with 60's country stars that are as loosely knit as a scarecrow in a tornado.",1087776000,13,965,4.396648044692737
1079585,2,6305771111,"I only gave this movie 2 stars because of its 2 stars: Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield. Without the presence of these 2 bombshells, the film is a complete bomb. As a piece of film history, it has its place. As entertainment, it's atrocious, even for the time. Still, as I've said, it does have Mamie & Jayne! The male actors are laughable and the plot virtually non-existent, although you can say that about a lot of modern films too. Only get this film if you're passionate about its 2 lusty blonde actresses. Otherwise, get a life!",1019952000,9,537,4.489795918367347
1079586,2,6305771111,"It seems like a good idea... 'Las Vegas Hillbillys,' a kind of a 'Krush Groove' for the possum pie and moonshine set, starring Jayne Mansfield and Mamie van Doren.  Duelling blonde bombshells, right?  Ah, no.  Van Doren is looking sad and puffy in this film as a 'tough' but disinterested saloon singer, longing for better days when she was straining angora sweaters and scratching out the eyes of good girls everywhere.  Jayne Mansfield sports a series of tentlike grandma dresses of the sort later found adorning the fashionable Weezie Jefferson, reading from cue cards with a kind of breathy, clueless abandon which is probably quite fetching when she's not dressed in a potato sack.  One can imagine her on her rendezvous with destiny, thinking, 'Oh no, we're about to slide underneath that semi truck!  But at least I won't have to think about 'Las Vegas Hillbillys' anymore.'  Between the two of them, they don't get more then seven minutes' screen time.  This movie is ostensibly a musical, in the sense that there is music in it, consisting of fifteen- or twenty-minute blocks of bad lip-synching (in an 85-minute film) which do nothing to advance the plot, such as it is.  Watch for Bill Anderson's all-KGB-agent backup band. 'We are American high-fashion models.'  I gave this movie a whole two stars because they *can* sing, after all... give them a break.  Richard Kiel makes a surprise appearance as, can you guess? a thug.  He actually has dialogue in this film, of a sort, and in watching his performance you really get a sense that unenthusiastically bunny-hopping between cable cars in 'Moonraker' represented the pinnacle of his acting career.  The plot: Woody Weatherby contemplates stardom, inherits a debt-ridden saloon from his uncle, goes to Vegas, tries to run the place, has a twenty-minute nap.  In the last ten minutes Aunt Clem magically fixes everything and starts a cream pie fight.  Van Doren kisses Ferlin Husky, thereby completing her descent to the innermost circle of Hades.  The End.  There was supposedly a sequel to this, 'Hillbillys in a Haunted House,' but I frankly am afraid to watch it.  Be my guest.",1001721600,5,2143,4.93854748603352

Well, I did watch it all the way through, but fast forwarded the country singing parts. If you like the '60s Country Music scene and have some time to kill, this may be for you. I was not impressed overall, but seeing what little screen time Jayne and Mamie had, it's no surprise it didn't do well. If you are a die hard fan of either Jayne or Mamie, you might like to have this in your collection, but other than that, forget it.",1396483200,2,585,4.051724137931035
