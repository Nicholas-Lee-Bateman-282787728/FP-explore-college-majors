8008900,2,B00019PD3O,"I was hoping to see a video about bikes or Sturgis. Instead, this is mostly about an annoying self proclaimed ""biker"" and his girlfriend riding to Sturgis in segments. Also includes an older guy talking about how great he is. Don't waste your time or money.",1316476800,,257,4.608695652173913
8008901,1,B00019PD3O,"I thought it was movie, just interviews
Something like an Easy Rider DVD but not as good",1229731200,3,88,4.235294117647059
8008902,4,B00019PD3O,"This is a good little flick for a number of reasons.

First is it light-hearted and well knitted together making it a pleasure to watch.

Second, the contrast between all those presented and the roles they play in the Greater Harley Society bear close attention and appreciation.

Sturgis is perhaps the most unique gathering of motorcyclists from every facet of the Harley culture (as well as other brands) in the United States.  This is a good first effort at presenting just a splinter of that event, putting faces to stories and stories on film.

Having owned and ridden three HDs, one a '43 45cc stocker, I truly felt for Martin when his snazzy semi-custom HD went on the fritz along the way to Sturgis.  Some things about Harley Davidson do not change with time / evolution of the ""product"".

Respect to ""Liddo"" Jim Cornett and Resurrection MC.

Nice little flick for the collection.",1221523200,,889,4.764705882352941
8008903,2,B00019PD3O,"This movie truly Blew Chunks...This dude must have been the first R.U.B. in the American Biker Culture. What a Bozo, talking about the ""HARLEY GODS"" I can not believe the gal kept rideing with him...In the end they get married. I would like to know if they are still married and if he is still rideing. Don't waste your time with it...unless you are in a COMA!",1210291200,,360,4.388059701492537
8008904,1,B00019PD3O,Segmental movie showing chopped scenes of a person and his girlfriend going to Sturgis.  I was greatly disappointed with the entire movie which was absent of scenes of Sturgis and mostly small clips of them together and a few of others encountered upon the way.  It is not clear if they made it to Sturgis and contains very little riding coverage.,1209254400,4,347,4.672131147540983
8008905,5,B00019PD3O,"This film about a young couple on their way to Sturgis in 1996 was very pleasing. The characters also showed are funny, interesting and sincere people. I've been to Sturgis once,in 2003, and it was nice to see some familiar places. Recommended",1209254400,,243,4.809523809523809
8008906,5,B00019PD3O,"This was fun to make. Me and Alex were riding anyway, so having a film crew was no biggie.  Liddo is a true American.  You get the whole spectrum of harley riders here.  A must see.",1203897600,,181,3.9722222222222223
