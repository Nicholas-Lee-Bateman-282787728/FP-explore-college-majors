Treize and his army have come asking for a one on one duel, but Zechs declines. The Libra and Peacemillion are about to collide, and the collision will destroy Earth. The Gundam pilots have to stop the catastrophe.

Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made.",1355356800,,882,4.653846153846154
7947068,5,B00005NB8S,"What can I say but WOW!!! This final DVD includes the last four episodes to the Gundam Wing Series finally resolves many of the questions I had as I watched the story progress. From the battle between the World Nation and the White Fang, the Gundam Pilots joined forces with the organization they were sent to destroy in the beginning, OZ. Heero will come as close as he possibly can to admit to Relena how much he loves her, even though he doesn't actually say the words. Wufei second battle against Treize left me speechless and the outcome shocked me even more. The final match with Epyon and Wing Zero will make you beg for more. My only complaint is that it's over, even with the Endless Waltz Movie, I want more, more Gundam Wing!!!",1001894400,11,738,4.474074074074074

Trowa tries to change his destiny and fate. Duo als boards the Libra and frees the Gundam scientists.
