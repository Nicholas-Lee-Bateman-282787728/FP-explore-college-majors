7861993,4,6304117825,"You can watch this online--the whole movie!  That will have to do until it is reissued on dvd.  Meanwhile, the various audiobooks of P.G. Wodehouse writings are excellent.  The Blandings Castle books are my favorites.",1405728000,7,217,5.142857142857143
7861994,5,6304117825,This 78 minute masterpiece is one of the most hilarious comedies ever produced.  The casting is perfect; O'Toole is just one of several who exhibit how masterful English acting can be.  The direction is flawless. Why on earth isn't this on DVD?  My copy is a lousy VHS print from e-Bay.  This production is better than 98% of the stuff currently for sale in the catalogues.  Anglophiles arise!,1165017600,17,393,4.720588235294118
7861995,5,6304117825,"Someone said elsewhere this movie was over the top (in a negative way) but they were right - it is ""over the top"".  Released shortly after the Jeeves and Wooster series (Fry and Laurie, BBC) and riding that wave of Wodehouse popularity, it is star-studded and lushly produced.  It is as ludicrous, preposterous and befuddled-funny as Wodehouse can be, and far better production quality than the old Wodehouse playhouse TV series.  Classic and wonderful.",1114819200,13,453,5.094594594594595
7861996,5,6304117825,"You'll love this marvelous adaptation of one of P.G. Wodehouse's  Blandings Castle stories.  Peter O'Toole is terrific as the rather foggy-headed, pig-loving Clarence, Master (sort of ) of Blandings Castle, and Richard Briers is Gally Threepwood come to life.  Intimidating Sisters, young lovers, and Beach the Butler are all played to perfection.  Tremendous fun!",1011916800,20,364,5.685185185185185
