We have watched it several times with our 4 year old so we are all using the same words and techniques.  We plan to take obedience classes too but highly recommend this video to others to get started.",1129161600,,371,4.426470588235294
7825135,5,6302409268,"Nine years ago I was lucky enough to have found this video training tape. And ever sense, I have recommended this video to everyone I know with a new puppy.  My husband and I were the proud owners of a new Rottweiler Puppy and wanted to make sure we could handle such a strong dog.  This video gave us all the tools we needed  to give us the best dog we have ever owned. The daily holding /training time with our Rottie produced a very sweet natured gentle dog that is marvelous to our three small children. It also allowed us to get intuned with our new puppy so we could have a better understanding of his needs. This video is a must for anyone wanting to train a dog to be a fantastic part of your family pack.  Julie  Smith CA.",1101081600,,731,4.119718309859155

For example, slamming a hand sharply on a kennel door and yelling at a puppy to be quiet, or lecturing at length to a dog who clearly doesn't understand english--""What do you have?  That is not a toy! Shame on you!  Give me that!  That is not yours.  Don't you chew on that!""  I would recommend the Monks of New Skete 3-video set instead.  Their methods also include dominance training and ways to become the pack leader with your puppy, but their methods follow more closely standard behavioral techniques that seem more clear to the dog and more ""centered"" for the owner. Other people liked this video.  Mine went in the garbage.  I didn't even feel comfortable donating it to our local library.",1037491200,14,897,4.521739130434782
