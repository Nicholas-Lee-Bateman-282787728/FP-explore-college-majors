537711,5,630303702X,"Alvin wants to grow up... he gets it... but with hi-larious results.
This is my favorite episode! But, a few things bother me/I want to point out:
1. Why does the adult Alvin have a squeaky voice?
2. Is the record producer guy's name Hans Likk or Lance Likk?
3. Who doesn't know how to spell ""Audition""? (you'll see what I mean)
4. The ""Alvin trips but reverses his wish"" scene is still rated ""Best Ending in all of Cartoon History""
5. ""I Wanna be BIG"" is my favorite song.
6. I no longer like county fairs and jukeboxes. (you'll see what I mean)

537712,5,630303702X,"This is stated to be the first of the Chimpunk's pardoies of some of Hollywood's famous movies. It is also the last time we will ever hear of Clyde Crashup, the Chipmunk's former secondary show man of the orginal Alvin Show.

And what a show it is, after the intorductions are made by brothers Simon and Thedore, Alvin was once again in trouble and tried to fixed it before Dave got home, we rush into the adventure which has for the first time...the 1960s Chipmunks meeting themelves in the early 90s.

A true case of Culture clash as the boys switch time periods and nearly wrecked all of Chipmunked history.

I can't tell you the ending, but you will be surprised at one artifact from the orignal Alvin show making a surprised ending twist.

If you love the  Chipmunks when they were orignally created, or if you love them now, this is the film for any Chipmunk fan.",1266451200,,869,4.474683544303797
537813,5,630303702X,"I've noticed Amazon fails to list a lot of episodes for older things like VHS. The episodes on this VHS are ""Babysitter Fright Night,"" ""Theodore's Life As a Dog,"" and ""Unfair Science."" If you already have ""Trick or Treason"" you may want to pass this one up since you only get one new episode. If you're a big Chipmunk fan, or can find it cheap enough, by all means buy it. It's fun to watch, and children always seem to love the novelty high pitched voices of the Chipmunks.
Episode Descriptions, from back of VHS:
""Babysitter Fright Night"": Dave has to be away overnight for business, but the gruesome governess he hires gives the Chipmunks the willies!
""Theodore's Life As A Dog"": During a full moon, something strange hounds the Seville household. Has Theodore turned into... a were-dog?!
""Unfair Science"": With Simon working on an android for a science fair, and Theodore on shoes that dance for themselves, what weird project will Alvin dream up?",1210723200,,951,4.7696969696969695
