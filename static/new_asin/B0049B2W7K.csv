8418917,1,B0049B2W7K,"The cover art is basically all you get for purchasing this DVD. Like too many slasher type films, this turns into a turgid psychological drama exploring the goon's psyche, when all we want is 90 minutes of the cover art. Why do not directors realize this and turn out this boring junk?",1375142400,2,285,4.5
8418918,1,B0049B2W7K,"From the other review, I was expecting a low budget Saw with exceptional acting.  What I got was an hour and a half of the tops of people's heads.  Honestly, most of this movie is shot from the nose up.  I suspect they just threw the camera on a tripod & didn't bother to adjust the angle",1296086400,7,288,4.017543859649122
8418919,3,B0049B2W7K,"Eddie Roberts [Kristopher Bryan Storey] has escaped from prison and returned to his old home town, taking up residence in the home he lived in as a child. There he builds his ""Fun Room,"" a torture chamber. He brings women there, one by one, and they do just as he likes, until he meets Heather [Stacy Wall]. Heather fights back psychologically, refusing to give in to Eddie's desires. The question is will she escape, and if she does, what will she be, after watching so much violence and terror?

The acting of the captured women in The Fun Room is very good indeed; their terror and begging are excruciatingly real, and Heather's behavior is realistic and plausible. The plot line, however, is weak; Eddie is neither well-crafted, nor an enigma. The cop whose wife is in the hands of a torturer is also not well painted, and remains unnaturally calm throughout; he states his emotions rather than showing them. Uneven, but interesting, the Fun Room shows us what can happen when a person is pushed past what they believe they can do, who they believe they are.",1291939200,5,1062,4.679144385026738
