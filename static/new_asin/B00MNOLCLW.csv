6590349,5,B00MNOLCLW,"It was a very funny sitcom in the early '80's.  It didn't last too long, and much of the humor is dated, but if you grew up at that time you will find the main stars' attempts to be accepted by the cool kids to be hysterical.",1431388800,4,225,3.7872340425531914
6590350,5,B00MNOLCLW,"Quirky show love watching them again. Brings back the styles of 1980's. Characters are funny and their slang conversation, like learning a secret code.",1427241600,5,151,5.333333333333333

6590357,4,B00MNOLCLW,"While I'm not a fan of this packaging/cover art, it was cheaper than the other (aka fancier/more New Wave) version and I'm OK with that. Love ""Square Pegs"" and can't wait to watch this. I'd previously watched reruns on YouTube. This is a way better option. Like, totally!",1480377600,,271,4.666666666666667

6590361,5,B00MNOLCLW,What's not to like with a John Hughes wannabe TV show about my High School experience. Holds up to those melancholy to relive those days.,1473120000,,137,4.52

6590363,5,B00MNOLCLW,"Wow!!! Where to start!!! Brought me back to my childhood. Great music from the eighties such a Devo. Billy Idol had a tune on the show but it wasn't included in this version. Guest stars like Martin Mull and Bill Murry helped keep it fresh.

So much talent in the cast it was a shame that it was cancelled after only one season. Start of at least 3 careers or at least very early in their careers.

Sarah Jessica Parker is the most famous. No need to really say too much bout that. Jamie Gertz is the prep gal. She is most famous at least to me as the odd person out in the love triangle on Twister. She was engaged at the beginning with Bill Paxton but couldn't compete w the twisters or Helen Hunt's character.

Also starring Meritt Butrick who was on Star Trek two and three. No telling how far he would have gone if his life wasn't cut tragically short.

Great price and highly underrated. My fianc was a bit wary but also enjoyed it.

Excellent price for the chance to relieve the nostalgia of the 80's.

Oh also includes Rick Nelsons daughter Tracy Nelson who is a bit snobbish. Think of Blair Warner of facts of life fame.

A nice quirky series. There are 19-20 episodes. The Christmas one is sometimes counted as either one or two episodes. That episode guest stars Tony Dow as one of the children's parents.

He is Wally from Leave It To Beaver fame. Also guest stars a baseball player Steve Sax??? 80's ball player.",1468195200,4,1425,4.350943396226415

6590374,5,B00MNOLCLW,"Ha ha ha ha, I remember watching a few of these episodes when it aired, and thought I don't know anybody like those people.....now at 50, I host Karaoke and I know all those people..... It's amazing what people will do to fit in with what they perceive as the in crowed....The show is about High school, 2 young girls, one trying to make it through school, the other trying to make it into the ""in"" crowd (in the 80's mind you) follow the situations they get themselves in and the lessons learned as they find out....it's okay to be yourselves. It reminded me of the Melissa Joan Heart series: Sabrina the teenage witch...but without the hocus pocus. It's a great laugh and the price, video quality and sound are great also.",1439596800,5,724,4.492424242424242
6590375,3,B00MNOLCLW,"Jewish show about Jewish teens in America in the early 80s. There are a three Catholic kids: two stereotypes of Italians who are lusty and dumb. And a stereotypical black character who says things like ""Giiiiirrrrrl"" and ""Chiilllllld"" while slinging her beaded braids around. There are no what liberals derogatoraily call WASPS (white anglo saxon protestants) around. The plots are about nothing. When they are about something it is usually liberal propaganda (drugs are good, Watergate was the ""worse scandal in American history"", etc). The other nonsense doesn't even pretend to be logical. I mean the only people who think that wearing glasses and braces are hideous are the two characters who wear glasses and braces, trying to pretend not to. They are the sources of their own frustration and ridicule in trying to be something they are not. Again, just made up drama for drama's sake. They are supposed to also be the ""normal"" ones. But instead they are the judgmental ones causing problems. No parents are shown. You would think these kids just had money given to them and they ran around like adults do whatever whenever. When they do show the one kid's dad he is divorced and self-involved ""of course"". The show is another in a long line of 80s shows where one of the actors dies of AIDS before the decade is out highlighting the trouble with the homosexual lifestyle. But one thing you get out of this is that you see kids dressing like kids (fully clothed) with unadulterated bodies like they/we were back then. The school reminds me of my school too. Gives a pretty good visual of how things were I would say.",1437955200,5,1621,4.772241992882562
