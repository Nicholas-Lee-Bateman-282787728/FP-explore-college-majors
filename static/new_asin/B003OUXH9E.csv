4162566,5,B003OUXH9E,I found this DVD to be one of the best resources for practicing yoga. It is like having a private yoga session with a really great instructor. I have physical limitations and found this to be of great benefit in adapting so many of the more challenging yoga positions. A feeling of overall calmness upon completion.,1294185600,,315,4.642857142857143
4162567,5,B003OUXH9E,"This is a great DVD for anyone healing from an injury, surgery, aging or new to yoga for that matter!
Lynn's clarity and compassionate teaching makes yoga very accessible and easy to follow.  You can tell she's been teaching a long time and is well trained in helping all levels of students.  It's unusual to find a DVD for home practice that the student can feel safe practicing with without direct teacher supervision.",1294185600,,420,4.739726027397261
4162568,5,B003OUXH9E,"For me, this DVD is an excellent supplement for the live classes I take with Lynn. She is a thoughtful, caring, excellent instructor/guide. I started this because of a physical issue, not being a yoga fan. Lynn's routines have helped me make an improvement in my condition beyond what I thought was possible. Regular yoga practice with this video will improve anyone's physical well-being. I highly recommend it.",1294185600,,412,5.073529411764706
4162569,5,B003OUXH9E,"Lynn Medow's DVD encourages anyone, regardless of age or experience to enjoy the benfits of Yoga. Her instruction is easy to understand and follow. The DVD has three different workouts designed for levels of knowledge and physical capability. It allows anyone, even those with physical limitations, to find an activity they can participate in. I think this would be a great gift, particularly for someone looking to start a Yoga routine or recovering from illness or injury. Besides the physical benefit, the routines have a calming, relaxing effect.",1292025600,3,550,5.261363636363637

The video is very informative and lets you work at your own pace while encouraging you to succeed.  I have done multiple yogas classes and have watched plenty of different videos, but this specific video has got me doing yoga on a daily basis for the first time.

8401734,5,B003OUXH9E,"Lynn Medow is a wonderful yoga teacher.  This particular DVD helped me immensely.  After suffering from a bad back, I decided to go back to yoga using this DVD.  Lynn was explicit in explaining the movements and the gentle yoga, mostly stretching and alignment was perfect for me.  I am so very thankful to Lynn and this DVD because I was unable to attend a class and yet by watching and doing what was described, I was able to stay limber and feel rested and ready for the day.

Bravo to Lynn.  I look forward to any upcoming DVDs.",1360195200,2,532,4.3232323232323235
8401735,5,B003OUXH9E,"I purchased this DVD after meeting Lynn at my yoga home studio. Lynn has a wonderful presentation style and her speaking voice is warm and friendly. She is the most knowledgeable person I have met since beginning my yoga practice. As a I registered nurse, I appreciate her wealth of information about body posture and proper movement through the yoga poses. Her attention to detail regarding poses and posture seems limitless. I am so happy with my purchase because it incorporates so much specific information and is so easy to follow along with. The breakdown of movements into chair and gentle movements as well as some more challenging poses is a great way to present the different styles. Thanks, Lynn :)",1330214400,,709,4.867768595041323
8401736,5,B003OUXH9E,"""Lynn Medow is a highly-experienced, easy-to-understand and compassionate teacher whose flow is very natural and relaxing. ""Graceful Aging"" is an excellent value with well over two hours of yoga instruction separated into three logical and progressive practices - from a chair practice, through a gentle practice and finally to a slightly more advanced deeper practice. I would strongly recommend this video to anyone looking to add a yoga routine to their senior center activities list, community recreational yoga programs or just for your own individual use to complement an existing personal regimen. Namaste!""",1295740800,2,614,5.612903225806452
