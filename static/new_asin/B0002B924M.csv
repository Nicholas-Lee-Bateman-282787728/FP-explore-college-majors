8025617,5,B0002B924M,"Unless you are familiar with lacrosse, the title of this movie would seem to be misleading.  'Little Brother of War' seems to be connected with the Native American game, possibly having to do with a famous game in June 1763 played outside a military fort.  When the gates were opened for the soldiers to watch the game.' the Indians changed to warrior status and overtook the fort.  However, except for this apparent connection to lacrosse, which the little boy, Jay, liked to play, the title seems misleading.

What this movie is really about has nothing to do with war, or even a little brother.  It is about a young boy trying to cope with the tragic death of both parents.  Jay seems to have some Indian blood, which would account for his visions of Native Americans in relation to both lacrosse and their spiritual beliefs.  However, those beliefs do not seem to be adequate in helping Jay cope with the loss of his parents.  Also, because he still is a little boy, he believes that his parents aren't dead but are in Chicago where they were to see a lacrosse game.  So, he sets off for Chicago when his aunt and her loser boyfriend are unable and unwilling to really care for him.

On the way, Jay gets left behind when the truck he'd stowed away on leaves while he is in a gas station bathroom.  So, he starts walking down the highway.  A man stops and offers him a ride.  It is obvious that the man is Catholic from a Rosary crucifix hanging from his mirror.  Fortunately, he is not a pedophile but an honorable man, and he takes Jay to the police station.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not include some scenes where this Catholic tells Jay about Jesus and a nutshell plan of salvation.  The DVD also omitted a scene where the detective who is supposed to bring Jay back to Vancouver, but instead takes him to Chicago, goes into a small country church to meditate and pray.  This is a shame because the scene would be a very spiritual bridge, connecting the death of the detective's father and also seeking Spiritual guidance about taking Jay to Chicago to them making the trip.  I am sure that including these scenes would be very much appreciated by traditional values, religious families.

Still, this is a very good movie for those who enjoy a spiritual element in the movies they watch.  I am giving the movie an A- because I think an excellent movie would have been an even better movie if they had included the Christian, Spiritual aspect to go along with the Native American spiritual elements.  There is a bit of rough language, especially by the uncaring boyfriend of Jay's aunt, and the boyfriend is shown doing drugs.  But, other than that, there is nothing that should be objectionable to traditional values families.",1232755200,,2737,4.6
8025618,1,B0002B924M,"I love lacrosse and looked forward to this movie's supposed homage to the game's native origins.  Sadly, there is next to no lacrosse in the movie at all, and the references to native history are overwrought, vague and confusing.  The director and writer (one and the same) was clearly trying to do something different, but he has failed miserably.  The plot is just plain dumb and goes to places that make no sense:  A boy's parents are murdered, so he runs away from his drug-addled aunt's house to Chicago where he believes his parents are waiting for him at a lacrosse tournament.  The detective investigating his parents' murder decides to give up his career to abduct the boy and help him get to the tournament.  Why?  Because the detective's estranged father has just died and his ex-wife has told him that he sucked as a Dad.  Oh, and lest I forget... seeing the lacrosse tournament makes everything suddenly okay for the orphaned boy who comes home and scores a winning goal for his pee wee lacrosse team.
Not even the fact that this movie was shot in my area makes it the slightest bit worth watching.  The bad plot is soured further by abominable acting and languid music mismatched to the screen images.  Only the cinematography and lighting have any redeeming character.
Boy, am I glad I rented this one before ordering it.
If you want to see good lacrosse footage, get War on the Floor.  If you want to see a good movie about native heritage, get Dances with Wolves.  If you want to see a film that looks like it was made by an amateur in a plodding Canadian, CBC made-for-tv-movie style, knock yourself out with this one!",1096416000,,1636,4.603448275862069
