1921383,5,B0000D9PFZ,"Bring on the Rubbadubbers and their OZ accents!  I love the frog who exclaims ""Swim-ming!"" when he gets excited.  Finbar the shark is funny and they all beat Dragon Tales by a mile!  I don't mind listening to these voices over and over and over again, which is what happens when you have a preschooler in the house.  I am so tired of Elmo's baby talk and Ord's dopey whine, I had almost given up on kid videos.  maybe grown ups think they aren't complicated enough, but I found them far more stimulating than the stuff we're getting on PBS Kids!",1114387200,5,545,4.356435643564357
1921384,4,B0000D9PFZ,"We rented this from the video store and my 5 year-old son

liked the cute, pretend adventures of the bath toys using their imagination.  Each of the 5 short episodes teaches a nice moral tale.  Not very clever, but cheerful and friendly.",1113264000,,237,4.595238095238095
1921385,1,B0000D9PFZ,"the rubbadubbers has a great opening sequence. when we saw it on a bob-the-builder dvd, kid wanted to see it again and again.

unfortunately, the opening sequence is the only part of this that is even remotely entertaining. the rest is just a series of boring stories, all with the same moral: it's more fun to share.

here's my moral: it's more  fun to watch a series with songs and/or fun characters. this has neither. try something else.",1104969600,4,440,4.615384615384615
1921386,5,B0000D9PFZ,"The editorial for this DVD is right on, so I'll pass on repeating that info. This DVD is truely eye candy for young and old. The animation is really cool and  dramaticallly different from most other cartoons. Think super realistic, 3-D; a bit similar to clay animation, but much more realistic. Water, bubble, and spash scenes are particularly plentiful and fun to watch. There is always a good learning lesson in the video which is very pertinent to preschoolers needs. The extras on the DVD are two games; several ""fill-in the puzzle piece"" picture games and a classic matching game. There is also character bios, an extensive narrated ""trailer"" with many video clips titled Rubbadubbers-Beyond The Bath, an extensive narrated photo gallery, and 3 bonus mini adventure clips. I have boys aged 3 & 4 who really enjoy this new series. All in all I think this show is quite worthy and very entertaining. I think the DVD is well worth getting. My children particularly enjoy playing the games.",1077840000,9,991,4.863905325443787

1921393,4,B0000D9PFZ,"Just a very brief review after watching a couple of episodes with my 3 year old. The characters live in the bathroom it appears. They use their imaginations to change their scenery. The writers create a learning experience such as: in one episode the frog becomes a train conductor and believe he can do everything himself, the story unfolds to where they need each other to work together to save the train. Another episode starfish wants to have a tail because she believes she can do incredible things if only she had a tail, like some of the other characters in fact do. Turns out the tail is an encumbrance and her greatest talent is one she already has, that of being a bath sponge. Simple stuff, good enough to hold my daughter's attention, and she was asking about it this morning even though it has been a couple of days since she watched. We are cutting way back on TV time, but this is one of the 'treat' shows we would allow.",1366588800,,936,4.416184971098266

1921395,4,B0000D9PFZ,"Children under four will find this light cartoon with its catchy tune and imaginatively drawn characters lots of fun.  We all have our favorite characters, and enjoy the rather moralistic plots that encourage children not to be greedy or selfish by imagining how things would be if they got their wishes.  The Aussie accents are pleasant, too, and not overdone.",1326672000,2,361,5.0
1921396,1,B0000D9PFZ,You would think that the creators of Bob The Builder would be able to come up with some better stories.  The animation is well done but the stories are boring.  Can't get the kids to watch it again.,1285891200,,198,4.184210526315789
1921397,5,B0000D9PFZ,"My son loves this DVD and I actually like DVDs that give the parent the option to chose whether the entire DVD will be shown or only an episode at a time (each episode is ~ 10 minutes long, I believe?).
It has a very catchy tune that often gets me humming along! ;-)",1222992000,,266,3.9444444444444446
