7864331,4,6304131860,"I have two versions of Oliver Twist so when I watched one I watched this one afterwards to compare and something popped out. They edited at least two scenes out! This was not random missing bits, but this was clearly edited out. Talk about revisionism! One scene has the bad guy threatening Oliver with a gun if he doesn't play ball...but this is missing in this version, so what it does to the scene is create confusion as to a women's reaction. The other scene edited has slipped my mind but is of a similar nature which just confirms the movie was edited. What's curious though, is this version is actually 3 minutes LONGER than my other version!
  One bother is with this obviously classic silent movie is they have failed to render due care with music added to it. they just played classical music all through it with no attention to the scenes during which it is played over, so sometimes it's distracting and sometimes it's almost ...silent.(77 minutes)
  You also get a 56 minute tape of keystone cops. I did enjoy both tapes, but as yet I don't know if they've played nanny state with this version as yet.",1399852800,,1114,4.527363184079602
