8102018,3,B000CSTKOM,"I was not impressed with this video. It was larger woman which made me feel a little better about myself. Hut if you've ever danced before like at a club or bar then you probably know all the moves they teach in this video. I thought it was a little to basic. But I liked that they didn't actually strip on the video as I wasn't looking for porn, and I could get the idea without them removing clothing.",1210118400,2,403,4.113924050632911
8102019,5,B000CSTKOM,This dvd is an instructional guide for learning how to perform a striptease. It is a very classy and well structured dvd. Worth the money if you want to try something new.,1167868800,2,171,4.375
8102020,1,B000CSTKOM,"I was very disappointed.  It was not what I expected, nor what I had hoped for.

I felt it was not very positive and that I was being ""talked down to"".

I'm sorry I bought it.",1165536000,3,175,3.8055555555555554
8102021,5,B000CSTKOM,"This dvd is the same as the one under the title, ""Exotic dancing for Everyday Women.""  I love this tape as it teaches you some of the beginning moves in erotic dance.  It also gives info on basic lap moves and other info about self-esteem, body love and how to create a romantic environment.  There's a lot of really good info here for women who are new to erotic dancing.

I hope more dvds from Susan will be forthcoming as she really is an excellent teacher and I think many students will appreciate her direct instructional approach to teaching this dance form.

If you have dance experience, this dvd will not be of much help to you.  For experienced dancers, I'd suggest buying ""The Art of Erotic Dancing,"" dvds by Fawnia or other performance related dvds on stripping.  Keep in mind that with the performance dvds, you will need to have the ability to learn or pick up on moves through an observational approach.",1159574400,12,918,4.560975609756097
8102022,1,B000CSTKOM,"For me it was big disappointment, I could hardly get anything from this DVD. The moves were too basic, dance routines were not interesting either. Also, I would say that it shows more a classical way of doing striptease, while being a young woman I prefer something more modern & energeting (in this sense I really liked Exotic dance series). I still think this DVD can be useful for women with no or limited dance experience, or for those who do not feel confident about their bodies - self-acceptance is quite a part of this video.",1158883200,12,533,4.5625
8102023,4,B000CSTKOM,"OK, so I don't have to be a supermodel to get into this...and Susan makes you feel good about yourself no matter what you look like.  I like that she uses real everyday women and not 100 pound lightweights in this DVD. Nice job.",1137628800,16,228,4.181818181818182
