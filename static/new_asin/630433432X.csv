7868189,5,630433432X,"The story develops further, as we learn a little bit more about the second impact -- and we are introduced to Kagi and Asuka.  Episode 7 is okay, as Misato stops a walking nuclear reactor in its steps.  Episode 8 picks up the pace with the entrance of Asuka Langley Sauer, a german girl who pilots unit 2.  She is very tempermental, and her and Shinji must battle a water-borne Angel.  This video keeps you on the edge of your seat and draws you deeper into one of the most intriguing OVAs ever!",987984000,,495,4.290322580645161
7868190,5,630433432X,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is loved for its action, drama, and humor, and volume 0:4 delivers!  In episode 7, a UN meeting introduces a replacement prototype for the Evangelions, one that is not operated by a human mind!  But things go horribly wrong:  The machine goes haywire and is about to have a nuclear meltdown!  Misato must go inside the machine and shut it down before it's too late!  Then, in episode 8, we are introduced to the German EVA pilot, Asuka Langley Soryuu and a man named Kaji.  This episode is hilarious.  Just when things were going fine, a new aquatic Angel attacks and Asuka and Shinji must work together in EVA Unit-02 to stop it!  A must have!",982540800,,668,4.554621848739496
7868191,5,630433432X,"This was the first whole EVA episode that I watched, the first one on the tape was a little iffy, but the action really came back with the introduction of Asuka.  Hilarious, with Toji getting slapped and Shinji in the red plug suit, get this video, it rocks like hell...",974505600,,270,4.4
7868192,5,630433432X,"I had put off buying the Neon Genesis Evangelion series for a long time and finally got around to it. 0:4 is a great video, with interesting little tidbits of what's going to happen in the future (and some great jokes too!)  Especially in the second episode, ""Auska Strikes""",954201600,,274,4.591836734693878
