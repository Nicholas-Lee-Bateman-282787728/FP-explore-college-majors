6284816,4,B00IPAORNI,"Nice twist on a well worn theme. Excellent acting from a strong French cast and great writing and direction. I'd give 5 stars if it was a bit more plausible, less sci-fi. That doesn't hurt the film, it just makes it a bit predictable but they do twist things up a bit. Overall, a nice little movie.",1424390400,,298,4.245614035087719

6284818,4,B00IPAORNI,"An interesting film. Basically a cop chasing a serial killer, but with a twist.
There is time travel, probably multiverse theory and paradox involved, but that isn't the focus of the story, even if treated interestingly.

It is not dialogue intensive, so non-French speakers won't find the sub-titling to be too much of a distraction.
Definitely worth watching.",1409270400,7,361,5.224137931034483

8644443,4,B00IPAORNI,"Time travel stories always throw me into a loop. And when the old self gets to interact with the new, anything goes. This is the strength and the weakness of this film's storyline. Still, the movie sustained my interest throughout. From scene to scene everything made sense. It was jumping twenty years--especially the return trip--that I became lost. But the characters were interesting and appealing, and there was a happy ending. Who can ask for more? 4 1/2 stars",1477008000,,466,4.9113924050632916
