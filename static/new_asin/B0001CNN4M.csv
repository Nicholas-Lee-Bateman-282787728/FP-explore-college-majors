8009929,5,B0001CNN4M,It's one wild ride and a wild time but just another 70s movie,1463616000,,61,3.769230769230769
8009930,3,B0001CNN4M,"I'm a fan of these 70's Blaxploitation flicks, and ""Brotherhood of Death"" is a quick fun watch.

Three friends find themselves targeted by the KKK, and join the army to escape the persecution at home. Over in Vietnam they learn how to fight, and how to make money thanks to the drug trade. They return home ready to take the fight back to the Klan.

Most of these films are low budget quickies, but ""Brotherhood of Death"" is a true cheapie. Vietnam looks suspiciously like the woods of Virginia, and the only sets are an abandoned barn and what looks like a basement bar. That's not a bad thing though, it give the movie a great vibe, and I'm in to see the Klan get what it deserves.

The acting is horrible, and the directing is awful. Quite a few times the screen is simply too dark to see what's happening. But for a free movie on Amazon Prime, I was entertained. If you like this type of movie, give it a shot.",1453766400,,914,4.271676300578035
