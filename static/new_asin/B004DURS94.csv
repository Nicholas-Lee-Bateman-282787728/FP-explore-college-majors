4334767,4,B004DURS94,This DVD is interesting.  I didn't expect any State secrets to be shown so you shouldn't expect that either.  A lot of it was what you'd expect; things everyone has speculated on being talked about in general by people close to the Presidency.  There are some fun facts talked about that you'd thought were considered bogus by everyone but nothing Earth shattering.,1336780800,4,365,4.854838709677419
4334768,1,B004DURS94,"I ordered this video in the hopes that it would reveal the ""secret"" of the President's Book of Secrets. However, it left the viewer with more questions than answers and did not really 'reveal' anything! I watched this video waiting for answers that never came. I expected more from the History channel. Very disappointed! Do not waste your time or money on this video!!",1333756800,,369,4.78125
4334769,5,B004DURS94,"Yo I just saw this in HD on the History Channel and could not believe what was revealed to us. I always wondered if they would come clean to us about the secrets behind the White House doors on things covering: Area 51, The Illuminati, The Budget, The Skull and Bones Club and various other secrets a president elect gets to find out about once they get in. It seems like just getting to know these things is reason enough to want to run because there are things being kept from us that would be game changers if they were officially known to the public. This program is a bold step forward sparking much convo in any arena and I hope they delve even further in the future. Please check this out. You will not be disappointed!! Peace!!",1308528000,34,735,4.333333333333333

4334776,3,B004DURS94,"This could have been a great documentary about the national intelligence system in America, how the president receives and uses classified information, etc. Instead, interviews with people who have actually worked in the White House and dealt with issues of national security are interrupted by the narrator randomly mentioning ""The President's Book of Secrets""!

Most of this documentary was a discussion of the real secrets that the government keeps and how the government would act in an emergency to protect the president and ensure the government would continue to function. Then, the narrator would interject with something like this (my tongue is only slightly in my cheek), ""Some people believe that there is a talking Dragon that lives in a bunker far below the White House and that if the President and Vice President and the Cabinet were all killed, the dragon would emerge to rule the country until the emergency had passed. If this is true, don't you think the president would read about it in his BOOK OF SECRETS?!?"" Then, the people being interviewed would discuss the actual plan of succession, never mentioning the dragon (or whatever conspiracy theory the narrator brought up) or the ""Book of Secrets""

Until the end, I was convinced that the people being interviewed had no idea that this documentary (can you really call it that?) would be about the Presidential Book of Secrets, because they literally never once referenced it until the last three minutes. Then, there were comments from only 3 people about whether a book existed and each of them said they doubted it and one mentioned how dumb it would be to keep all of our secrets in one place, because it could be easily stolen.

In the end, if you wanted to learn about how the government keeps secrets, and how the president acquires and uses intelligence you might learn something from this video, but be ready to be annoyed by the regular interruptions of the narrator making allusions to the Book of Secrets, and then having the people being interviewed talk about something completely different.

If you wanted to learn about whether a Presidential Book of Secrets exists, you will be really disappointed by this documentary, because there is essentially no discussion of it at all! Here's a hint that this isn't really about the said book: they don't interview a single presidential historian! So, this book is supposed to have been passed down by 44 presidents, and they're not going to present any evidence that such a book exists. While this is probably because no such book does exist, History Channel knows this and is just trying to profit off the National Treasure movie, by having the narrator mention the book every five minutes.

But it is plausible to me that presidents could have handed down some writing to each other. The is the famous example of the flackjacket that gets handed down to each new press secretary that has letters from previous ones, and no one is allowed to read it except the current press secretary. Could there be something like that among presidents? Seems plausible to me? Do we have historical records of correspondence between presidents and former presidents? That could make for an interesting documentary that might be worth of the title of this one. But if you're looking for any like that, or for that matter anything like what is in the National Treasure movie, you won't find it here.",1405123200,,3413,4.897923875432526
4334777,3,B004DURS94,"This is for all the people who have asked questions about why certain question were not answered in this DVD.

Questions such as:
Who has security clearance higher than the President?
What information does the President have access to and not have access to?
Why were certain secrets not revealed in this DVD?

News flash, people....... the general population (including YOU reading this) are not privileged to know some of that information because it is classified. It is classified and will not be revealed to the public for good reason. Have you ever heard the expression ""Sometimes questions are better left unanswered""? This DVD is a prime example. If you think you are privileged to such information not even the President has access to, you need a serious reality check.",1402704000,,777,4.969230769230769
4334778,5,B004DURS94,I am fascinated with this portion of  American history that is not discussed in the main line history or is deliberately ignored.,1401926400,,129,4.863636363636363

4334785,4,B004DURS94,Skeptics or conspiracy theory lovers it matters not. One thing is for sure. The head of any goverment body regardless of country will always have access to undisclosed information. So worry not about how much of this information contained is the truth or how much is just rumour for the fun is in the idea.,1359936000,,306,4.581818181818182

4334788,4,B004DURS94,"The simple fact that the elected 'President of the United States' doesn't have the highest security clearance is enough to draw into doubt, if not destroy, the myth that the USA has a 'representative' government.

Most people don't even know that the President has limited clearance.

The question we should all ask is: if the President is not at the highest level in government, who is?

Why aren't we allowed to even know who has the highest clearance, or what is the position of such a person and who appoints such a person?

Who decides what the President is allowed to know / have access to?

This documentary doesn't answer those important questions.",1351036800,17,656,4.769911504424779
