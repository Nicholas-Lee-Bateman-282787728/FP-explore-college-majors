4111472,4,B003D124KM,"This is a very faithful retelling of the story of Heidi, acted entirely by dogs (with animated mouths). It's arguably one of the cutest movies ever made. I deducted one star ONLY because this DVD version is missing or truncated several of the scenes that were aired on TV. I'd watched it on my mom's house because she recorded it on Dish. I then bought the DVD, and was disappointed with the number of scenes that were either shortened or removed entirely. There's an extra feature (looks like a music video), but no ""deleted scenes"" that I could find. Not sure why they'd remove material from the DVD! :[

It's still adorable though!!",1388707200,,635,4.619469026548672

4111474,5,B003D124KM,"My daughter saw this one day was in love. She loved the story being told through dogs. It was emotional for her towards the end because she is sensitive, but it ended happy. We love it :)",1365206400,2,187,4.081081081081081

4111476,5,B003D124KM,"This is without a doubt one of the cutest video stories of Heidi that I have EVER seen!  Cute enough for any animal-loving youngster but entertaining enough for an adult!  The costumes are magnificent...even down to the tiny

4111477,5,B003D124KM,Heidi 4 Paws is one of the cutest movies out there. My entire family enjoyed it. I hope to see the other 4 Paws movies available on Amazon. I am sure to buy them if they are offered!,1293494400,5,182,3.8157894736842106
4111478,5,B003D124KM,"Cute retelling of the classic tale with dogs playing the main characters.  The story is shortened and changed to be doggie-centric but it preserves the spirit and the main plot points.  They keep the emphasis on the need for education and the importance of reading as well as the restorative properties of nature and simple living.  The action is entirely dogs dressed in costumes with computer generated backgrounds and doggy mouths.  The dogs are well trained and the effects make the dogs more relatable.  There are many silly parts and goofy costumes that keep the film fun for adults (so long as they're a dog lovers).  The voice acting varies from character to character some of the voices are grating, but Angela Lansbury and Stephen Rea are a joy to listen to.  My favorite part was the Pomeranian Goats.  They really skimped on the costumes for these guys and it's definitely to the viewer's benefit.  They are just plain old Pomeranians prancing around wearing caps with long pointy horns.  Everyone who has seen the back of the dvd case at my library has asked to have us hold it for them.  Overall it's a cute silly romp for kids and dog lovers.",1286582400,10,1157,4.678217821782178
8394597,5,B003D124KM,OH MY GOSH.  This movie has to be seen to be believed.  It's kinda strange- these dogs 'acting' out the story of Heidi.  Kids will like it- although it's a bit surreal- it's worth a watch.,1494979200,,188,4.166666666666667

8394603,1,B003D124KM,"I recently watched this movie with my grand kids, (4 and 7). It was so bad. My head hurts. This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. At first I felt a little guilty that I picked out such a horrendous ""film"" and subjected them to it, but afterwards I realized that I did them a huge favor because now anything they ever see will be better, and they can appreciate even the craft that goes into informercials or the home shopping network. At first, I thought... Wow, what a disaster of a half-realized movie, but at least the kids probably won't notice, they'll like anything with puppies, but then my 7 year old granddaughter started throwing up uncontrollably and my 4 year old grandson wouldn't stop crying. They both kept screaming, ""poppy, poppy, why is this movie so stupid?! Why are the graphics so bad?!?"" I was pretty impressed that they were such harsh critics. These kids really know their computers I guess. My 4 year old, bobby, was saying (in between sobs) that he can make better movies on his phone. The funny thing was, he doesn't even have a phone, I think. Here I am trying to console these kids, and tell them it isn't so bad, here I had spent $12 plus shipping, so I wanted them to give it a chance so at least my $12 wasn't a complete waste, but every time the dogs started to talk, they were screaming and crying. They said it was creepy and scary and was giving them nightmares. And I said, but you aren't even asleep? And my 7 year old, Haley, said ""I wish I was asleep. I wish I were dead."" This was the most disturbing thing I have ever heard in my 78 years on this planet. I didn't even know what to say. I got up from the couch to turn off the tv and just then the credits started to roll. Both kids got up and walked out of the room without speaking a word to me. I didn't know a movie could be so bad and have such a damaging effect on young minds, or myself either. I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning up vomit off the floor while they locked themselves in their rooms. The kids haven't spoke not to me since, and my daughter and her husband asked me not to come over anymore. I've spent the last 3 thanksgivings alone. I didn't know a stupid movie about some dogs with animated mouths could possibly have such a negative and lasting effect. The cgi flat sets look like they were made on windows '95 ""paintbrush"" program. Everyday I regret the day I purchased this movie on amazon. I ask god everyday to give me those 60 minutes back, but more importantly. Give me my life back!",1394236800,2,2523,4.247401247401247
