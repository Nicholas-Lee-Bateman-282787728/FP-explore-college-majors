7849718,5,630354472X,I remember watching this in high school.  Every character stood out on their own.  Donna Dixon was my favorite-playing Sonny Lumet-beautiful and brainy.  Wendie Jo Sperber was also wonderful.  It She had the best lines.  I always liked to see Hanks and Scolari get into the women's clothing before they got caught.  Every episode is very funny and it's nice to seethem again!,1012348800,,375,4.873015873015873
7849719,4,630354472X,I have been a Bosom Buddies fan since the show came out. Why it still doesn't air is beyond me. This and all the other video's are must haves. When ever I need a smile - these are the tapes that do it!,990057600,,201,3.697674418604651
