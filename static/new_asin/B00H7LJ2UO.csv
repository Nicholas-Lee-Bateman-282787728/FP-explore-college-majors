6137895,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"One August day, the patriarch of an Oklahoma family goes missing. The crisis rallies the family of Violet and Beverly Weston: Their three grown daughters and significant others, and Violet's sister Mattie Fae and her husband and son. The extended family encounter that follows is a heart-wrenching raking over of old grudges, family secrets and new disputes. The result has been called a black comedy. This reviewer was thoroughly enthralled, but the sensation was more like watching a train wreck: You can't take your eyes off the movie, but you're pretty sure it isn't going to end well.

The movie is an adaptation of a play, and most of the action takes place in and around an Oklahoma farm. The cast is stacked, and the acting is just awesome. Meryl Streep will surely rate an Oscar nomination as Violet, the aging, venomous and drug-addicted mother of the clan. Julia Roberts should also get an Oscar look as the oldest daughter, stepping up to take charge of the family crises while dealing with a brewing divorce and an unhappy teenage daughter of her own. Much of the plot and the dialogue are oriented around the female members of the family, but viewers are encouraged to watch for superbly nuanced supporting roles by Sam Shepard, Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor, and Benedict Cumberbatch.

There is a lot in this movie, but it won't be for everyone. The family dysfunction is often painful to watch, relieved by some moments of humor and by a certain reverence for the Oklahoma landscape. Highly recommended.",1389398400,19,1517,4.875968992248062
6137896,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"I've never seen the play (although now I wish I have), but I really loved the movie. I was surprised a little by the ending. I suppose I expected some sort of a happy ending, and it turned out to be a very depressing one.

It was a hilarious movie, but it was also a sad one. It's a story of a f***ed up family just trying to survive the mere exhaustion of being related to one another. It really makes you appreciate your own family, or at least it did for me. My family is hardly perfect, but I'm lucky to have one with a fraction of the problems these people do.

I want them to be happy, and want it all to be resolved. Unfortunately, in reality people rarely live happily ever after. I love it for it realism and its laugh out loud bits of black humor.

It is a must watch. It isn't pretty by any means. It's a story of a family holding on by a thread, and it grows thinner every second only to break in the end.",1389398400,3,917,3.972826086956522
6137897,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"I don't think I've seen a film competing in the Oscar race this year with just as many powerhouse performances as ""August: Osage County."" Every actor is cast perfectly in a film where each character is well written, although the movie itself is basically an abridged version of the stage show. On stage, ""August"" is a night of three acts and three and a half hours. On screen, it's just about two hours long. Scenes were shortened, some were cut, but its essence remains.

Tracy Letts, writer of the stage show, wrote this film adaptation as well. It appears that he didn't mind cutting the film down considerably for the screen. The film is able to avoid becoming a ""greatest hits"" version of the play. Yet it can be called an abridged version of the stage show, but that's not quite right either. It's its own animal. It can't help but feel stagy but I certainly don't think that detracts from the experience.

""August: Osage County"" tells the story of the Weston family. Three sisters - Barbara (Julia Roberts), Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) and Karen (Juliette Lewis) come back home after their alcoholic, yet soulful and brooding father Beverly (Sam Shepherd) goes missing. Their mother, Violet (Meryl Streep) has basically ruined each one of these girls' lives in one way or another. She has cancer of the mouth, but is constantly smoking like a chimney. Each character has their own story going on. Letts keeps just enough of each character in this condensed adaptation to make it feel like everybody is well-examined and written. I still wish it was the same three and a half hours that the play was, but I understand why that wasn't an option.

When a film contains numerous stellar performances like this, a complaint about the running time hardly means anything. Meryl Streep continues to prove that she can do no wrong. You've never seen her play a character like Violet Weston. She's a serial killer, and words are her bullets. When she goes on ""truth-telling"" rampages, no one is safe. She gives a performance that might remind you of Elizabeth Taylor's classic turn in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"". A great woman whose moral and mental health is very much in question, who is biting, clever and ruthless. A twenty-minute long dinner table scene (which is one of the play's three acts) is absolutely terrific, because this is where everything begins to disintegrate.

Julia Roberts surprised me as well. She's done a few incredible dramatic performances, but I mainly think of her as a rom-com actress. She has a meaty, complicated role in Barbara Weston, and she nails it. Other standouts include Julianne Nicholson, who I'm shocked isn't a bigger star than she is. Margo Martindale is also fantastic as Aunt Mattie Fay. But the truth is there's not a bad performance to be found in all of ""August: Osage County"".

One thing you must know before seeing this film is that it's absolutely no comedy. Its trailers depict it as a lighthearted family comedy, and that's not really true at all. It's potent as both a drama and a comedy, however it's not lighthearted in the slightest. These are miserable, miserable people. It's relatable in so many ways, but you can remember, hopefully, that you and your family could be worse.

Tracy Letts clearly loves manic, cynical people. There are so many highs, lows and dramatic confessions here, that you are likely to feel emotionally exhausted when it's over. You'll also be in a considerate state of shock when it's all said and done. I sat in the theater, with a large crowd, who didn't start to tinker out of the theater until the credits were almost over. It gave me the same experience that the stage show did, and I consider that to be a high compliment.

6137898,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"""August: Osage County"" (2013 release; 120 min.) brings the story of one dysfunctional family. As the movie opens (pre-credits), we see Beverly (played by Sam Shepherd) interviewing a live-in housemaid to help him deal with Violet (played by Meryl Streep), who has mouth cancer and pops pain medicine like it's candy. The opening credits then roll to the tune of Eric Clapton's ""Lay Down Sally"" (which will play a few more times in the movie, it is Vi's favorite song ever). Not long afterwards, Bev goes missing, and the three daughters Barbara (played by Julia Roberts), Karen (played by Juliette Lewis) and Ivy (played by Julianne Nicholson) and their husbands/significant others are all coming to Osage County, OK. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: ah yes, the performances! Let's start with this: as big a fan as I am of Meryl Streep, I think she is way off course in this one, with her performance so borderline over the top that it almost ruins the movie, You can just feel the ACTING dripping off the screen. On multiple occasions Meryl's character Vi dishes out zingers left and right that just end up hurting the people she supposedly loves, but Vi insists that ""I'm just truth telling"". The big surprise for me instead was Julia Richards, now 46, and possibly turning in her most mature movie role in her career, ""Erin Brockovich"" notwithstanding. At one point we see her character Barbara getting into an argument with her husband, who claims this place is a madhouse, to which she snorts back ""This madhouse is my home!"", ha! Other noteworthy performances are from Chris Cooper, perhaps the ""sanest"" guy in the entire dysfunctional family, and Abigail Breslin (yes, the erstwhile little girl in ""Little Miss Sunshine"") , playing the 14 yr. daughter of Julia Robert's character.

The movie opened today here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to go see it. When I arrived for the late matinee showing at the local art-house theatre, there was a line around the block, literally, so I got in line and asked ""is there something special going on?"", but no, it was simply ""August: Osage County"" opening! The screening was PACKED, tilting heavily towards toward seniors for some reason (not that there's anything wrong with that). Bottom line: at times the movie is highly enjoyable, and emotionally HEAVY, but at other times the acting is so OBVIOUS and almost over the top, that it really detracts from the movie. Hence my mixed 3.5 star rating.",1389312000,2,2562,4.83371298405467
6137899,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"Typically, a Pulitzer Prize winning play adapted to film, starring Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep, sounds like an Oscar winning film in the making.  Well, I've got news for you!  Not even the undeniable skill of Streep and Roberts can automatically erase a troublesome plot full of yawn-worthy moments and childish behavior.  Obviously, you can't pick your family, but if you could, it's impossible to imagine anyone would want anything to do with the Weston family in August: Osage County.

Directed by John Wells, most recently notable for developing Showtime's comedy drama, Shameless, August: Osage County stars Meryl Streep as Violet Weston, the drug addicted wife of her recently `gone missing' husband, Beverly (Sam Shepard).  Violet and Beverly have had a complicated marriage with one another - both being open about their substance abuse and individual flaws.  However, with Violet developing mouth cancer and spending the majority of her time ""stoned"" on prescription pills, Beverly hires a live-in housekeeper (prior to going missing), Johanna (Misty Upham).

Distraught with the absence of her husband, Violet calls in the rest of her family - some of whom are local while others have relocated at a lengthier distance.  The first to arrive is her trusted, outspoken sister, Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale), her husband, Charles (Chris Cooper) - and some time later, their awkward, unemployed son, ""Little"" Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch).

The eldest of their three daughters, Barbara (Julia Roberts), begrudgingly returns to town, along with her husband, Bill (Ewan McGregor), and their daughter, Jean (Abigail Breslin).  Regardless of appearance, Bill and Barbara are hardly happy, especially since the two quietly separated after failing to reconcile after Bill has an affair with a younger woman.  Eventually, several more family members make appearances, including Violet's two other daughters, Ivy (Julianna Nicholson), Karen (Juliette Lewis), and Karen's flashy fianc&eacute;, Steve (Dermot Mulroney).

Finally, with the family all under the same roof, and the mystery of Beverly's disappearance solved, the real fireworks begin - and nearly everyone (at dinner) unloads their dirty laundry.  Violet, devastated and high on medication, takes her tirade to the extreme, prompting Barbara to take family matters into her own hands and attempt to sober-up her mother before she does any more damage.  But, with several secrets looming large over the family, it's quite possible they all might end up going in their separate directions.  The question becomes:  how much pain and how many secrets can one family possibly take?

You see so many films in this day and age following the story of a dysfunctional family.  Needless to say, all families have their issues, but most of them don't advertise it for everyone else to witness.  That seems to be the general theme of August, as nearly all of these characters have something to keep from one another, and each of them goes to certain lengths to keep their individual secrets or failures quiet.  The Weston family operates much like a typical hierarchy where the people at the top (in this case the parents) pass down judgment for all of their children's wrongs.  The problem with that is the parents seem to have more issues within themselves than the children.  In fact, if these characters were more elaborate, you'd probably find out each and every one of them wound up in therapy at some point due to the unorthodox manner in which they were raised by their parents.

Unfortunately, the interaction between Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts is about the only thing about this film that isn't in danger of putting you to sleep.  Both Streep and Roberts are worthy of acclaim from the very get-go, especially Streep who portrays this overbearing, controlling woman that is so out of control that she obviously requires help.  This is clearly one of the reasons Beverly hires someone to take care of her before he takes off - because he just doesn't want to deal with this woman anymore.  Enter Julia Roberts, who is nearly a mirror image to her mother - just without the major drug problem.

The arguments and eventual brawl between Streep and Roberts highlights a movie that has a ridiculous amount of outstanding acting - all of which is incorporated into a story that seems far too long and uneventful.  Benedict Cumberbatch (who I swear is everyone you look these days) shows up without a British accent - so that's pretty noteworthy, too.  His character, in one of his more unconventional roles, becomes one of the centerpieces in the story, and what a disturbing, unforeseen centerpiece it is...

Overall, August: Osage County (which is in Oklahoma if you were wondering) received a ridiculous amount of acclaim as a play, and that's not hard to imagine.  However, plays are restricted to a stage and keep the focus on the acting.  In the case of this film, the spectrum is much broader and grander in scale.  Moviegoers typically go to movies to be entertained, yet this film is lacking in that particular department.  This no doubt that Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts are superb in their portrayals, but even they can't make this film likeable.  There's too much drama, too much negativity, and very little positive aspects - which Chris Cooper's character even points out at one point.  Still, the message is not received very well in his speech as the secrets of what seems like another life unravels around these disillusioned individuals.  Lovers of drama should check this out, while everyone else should feel free to pass it over for something a little more uplifting.

Great acting - Meryl Streep amazing as always - can't save the script that seems rushed and even desperate to make you feel something for the Weston family - but it never happens.

6137901,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"Is it Oscar time already? Here comes Meryl Streep's 2013 entry, a film adaptation of Tracy Letts' Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning play of the same name; AND she has amazing company. This cast is to die for, even though the hateful characters they portray are ruthless, sordid and cruel. (This has been opened in a few select cities in order to qualify for this year's Academy Awards.)

We admire:
  * Meryl Streep (""Hope Springs"") Violet is pure venom, even after we hear her life history and try to sympathize, she's just evil. Her drug of choice makes quite a pharmacy! In my opinion, Streep is given too full a rein: The dialog is adequate, we don't need all the histrionics as well. I saw this on stage and it was effective without the extra Methody tics.
  * Sam Shepard (""Safe House"") Beverly her husband, has had enough. He prefers scotch.
  * Julia Roberts (""Mirror Mirror"") Barbara was her daddy's favorite, but the apple didn't fall very far from the tree: her tongue is pretty sharp and she is an unyielding sort of woman.
  * Ewan McGregor (""Jack the Giant Slayer"") Bill is trying to understand the family dynamics so maybe he can understand his wife Barbara a little better.
  * Abigail Breslin (""Ender's Game"") Jean is only fourteen, but pretending to be a little more grown up sure can be fun!
  * Juliet Lewis (""The Switch"") Karen didn't come back to the old homestead after she went off to college and THIS time she has hit it lucky!
  * Dermot Mulroney (""Joline"") Steve is wealthy, drives a great car and Karen will marry him in Florida next January!
  * Margo Martindale (""Justified"") Mattie Fae is Violet's only sister. They both have secrets.
  * Chris Cooper (""The Muppets"") Charlie is the nicest in-law of the bunch (his prayers CAN go on a little too long), but if Mattie Fae doesn't button her lip she might not see her 39th wedding anniversary.
  * Benedict Cumberbatch (""The Fifth Estate"") is stunning as Little Charlie, Mattie Fae's son. This actor is brilliant! This time he's a shy, awkward young man who arrives late, plays the piano and sings.
  * Julianne Nicholson (""Boardwalk Empire"") is Ivy, the third daughter. She stayed around and took a lot of lip from her heartless mother.
  * Misty Upham (""Frozen River"") is Johnna, the young woman hired to help care for Violet. Johnna is the calm at the center of the storm but we LOVED it when she picked up that shovel! Born in Montana and raised south of Seattle, Misty has been working steadily since 2002.

This story is about a toxic family and its chemical dependencies, both pills and alcohol that drive people to do what they do. It felt really good to watch Barbara fling all those prescription bottles at her mother's doctor, but I was clutching at straws because there are only three people in the entire story that I can remotely care about. (I always want someone to root for.)

Do NOT see this film if you want relaxing entertainment but by all means SEE IT if you want to see brilliant acting! Captions on the DVD would help me understand Sam Shepard.",1387152000,94,3051,4.591497227356747

She is by far the most complex character in August: Osage County and that is quite the feat.  The dinner scene following the funeral is a perfect examination of each characters personality.  This film is full complex characters that have even stranger relationships!  Drama is not lacking in this film.  Everyone has that family member who rubs them the wrong way, but if you want to fill good about yourself, watch August: Osage County.

6138013,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"I loved this movie.  It sort of reminds me of my dysfunctional family though this family has mine beat.  It has several humorous moments that made me laugh out loud but there are bittersweet moments too.
Meryl Streep is just wonderful in this movie as the mother (Violet) who has a pill popping problem.  Her grown daughters have come home due to a death in the family.  Two have moved out of state while the middle daughter stayed rather close by.  You quickly see what the relationships are between mom and her daughters, the siblings to one another, as well as other family members.  The dinner table scene is one of my favorites.
I found Juliette Lewis's character to be annoying but I think she tends to play annoying, silly characters at times.  And Meryl Streep's granddaughter, I wanted to slap her face.
I don't want to give away too much about this movie so I'll just say I really enjoyed it.  The ending left me wondering about Violet and what happens to her.  What happens to Barbara?  Ivy?  Where do they all go from here?",1460332800,3,1035,4.510752688172043

Basically, it's a great representation of what you shouldn't do if you don't want a train wreck of a family. There are all kinds of stories recounted of the pain and misery they caused each other through the years; how it works as a cancer, generationally, if not treated and excised.
Superbly acted by all, it will make you appreciate your family if they're not as messed up as this one. It leaves you melancholy and wanting to call your mother and kids to tell them how much you love and appreciate them if they've been halfway decent to you.

6138025,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"Minor spoilers will be said in this review so...

This has become one of my new favorite movies ansd I don't even like drama films much. To me this movie is like a black comedy and always makes me laugh because of the dialogue and the way the lines are delivered (courtesy of Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts' amazing performances). Each character is funny and I like the Oklahoma plains setting because I'm very country. The bluray looks amazing. Each time the camera shifts to reveal background scenery of thr plains, tree's and the lake abd even the towns my eyes are always glued to the screen in awe.

The story is pretty simple. A family crisis happens bringing every family member back together, a family that was pretty dysfunctional in the past but are otherwise able to get by (under the best of circumstances... --Ewan McGregor). As the film goes by we learn about each character and their problems and watch as the family completely breaks apart in the end. It sounds depressing but its actually entertaining and funny. From characters like Karen who is not willing to accept reality and be forced to be believed that her new husband is perfect to Little Charles (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) who is a social screw up who shares a relationship with his ""cousin"" Ivy, the stories are engaging and you'll be left wondering what happens afterwards to these characters in the end. You'll even be wondering how their problems will be resolved while watching. The 14 year old girl Jean, played by Abigail Breslin to my surprise is the SAME little girl from Signs! How she's grown!

One thing I want to point out, not criticizing the story in general, but of the character Ivy. Her relationship with Little Charles is supposed to be kept a secret...YET she does an awfully horrible job trying to hide it! Examples are when she tries kissing him outside out in the open where someone could have easily been eavesdropping. Second and third is at the infamous ""dinner scene"" when he blurts out ""I have a confession"" causing her to feverishly plead ""No Charles, not like this."" If that didn't give anything away that there's at least something going on between those two then I don't know what. But it doesnt end there. In the same scene immediately following it when he runs out excusing himself, his mother Maddy Faye criticizes him as usual calling him Little Charles, having Ivy reply ""(sniff) Charles. (sniff, sob) His name is Charles.""
I mean...she really did not try to keep their relationship a secret. That's the only gripe I have with her character.

This movie to me is like one of those nice little getaways, meaning its a movie I'll enjoy seeing anytime or if I'm preoccupied with home projects or work I'll have this playing in the background. Watch this movie if you haven't and watch it in Bluray HD for the best viewing. It's really entertaining and its sure to bring some laughs to the table.

Also any movie description containing ""dysfunctional family"" or in this case ""dysfunctional mother"" is a sure tip off of what the watcher is in for.
It's really over the top, over acted and a waste of a lot of great talent.

My only complaint, and it's a big one, is that the script is one-dimensional.  It starts out dark and depressing and just when you think it can't get any worse, it does.  All of the characters in this highly dysfunctional family, deal with their problems by leaving, either by booze, drugs, promiscuity, divorce, or finally just by getting in the car and driving off.  No one learns anything.

This is the original author's doing, so while I won't watch this film again, I definitely won't seek out its author. I'm guessing that the point of creating a dysfunctional family in the context of current reality is that it is possible to survive it well (resulting in functionalism) or poorly (compounding problems and a new generation of cruel participants). But sane people understand that cruelty is wrong, and no one is shocked anymore by the drug abuse (escapism) and surprise affair that labels a sibling a first cousin until two siblings started sleeping with each other.

This is a movie about people who verbally abuse each other and lose relationships in the process. These people, especially the women in the family, lack effective interpersonal communication skills. The entire dialog could have been lifted from a self-help book - things *not* to say if you want a relationship with someone. It made me think and feel, but I can't say that the feeling was good. The movie had villains and victims, but no real heroes, unless you count the people who removed themselves and their children from this toxic situation. The movie introduced characters and gave them problems/obstacles, but did not present solutions/resolutions according to the traditional plot arc. Even the daughters who got away from the evil mother had continuing problems in life stemming from low self esteem and unhealthy communication patterns.

6138072,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"As harrowing as this movie is, I totally loved it.  It is based on Tracy Letts' Pulitzer Prize-winning play and the unbelievable cast in this film makes the story even more compelling.  Every actor is this film was really  good.  I was a little disappointed in Julia Roberts' performance.  for the entire time, she was just one angry woman and there were no other distinguishable emotions in her performance.

It is a story about a family from rural Oklahoma.  Aging mother with cancer and father who is struggling to deal with his wife's illness and uncontrollable mix of prescriptions that make her unbearable to live with.  As faith with have it, it is his death, not his wife's that brings the rest of the family together: three grown daughters with families, lovers and issues of their own.  And during this family gathering thinks start to unfold.  Emotions, traumas. anger, disappointment - all erupt at once and no one is untouched by the events.

All families have issues, but this family's issue seems to span from its inception.  It is disturbing, it is sad, it is overwhelming and undeniably profound for everyone involved.  It got me thinking about other families I know where family members, particularly parents think that they can get away with everything when it comes to their demands.  On a pretense of love and caring, they take it out on their own offspring.  It is in the parents' minds how things ""should be"" or ""could be"", how children are supposed to be, how far away are they supposed to live from their parents, how often they are supposed to visit.  All these ""rules"" and expectations, have nothing to do with spouses, children and lovers of their own kids.  So parents, push and pull, demand and expect the unimaginable.  They create codes that only benefit themselves with entitlement for all the sacrifices they made in their lives for their own children/  More often than not, such people forget that such behavior is not love, it is selfish expression of (self) destruction that ruins everyone surrounding it.  But buttons get push in the name of family togetherness.  And because it is family, everyone thinks they can get away with it - until of course it is way too late.

This is complicated psychological drama that moves viewer on many different levels.  It is raw and profound but also heartbreaking.  At the end - everyone gets what they deserve, whether they like it or not. At the end - there is complete emptiness - everyone is left to their own devices - but at least they all get o live their own life instead of having to meet other people's expectations (and approvals).",1441929600,,2618,4.741150442477876

6138103,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"Having lived in the part of Oklahoma portrayed in this film for nearly two decades, I can identify with a dysfunctional Bible-Belt family like the Weston's in ""August: Osage County,"" but much of this film misses the mark for me. The film's greatest asset is also its biggest problem: the Imperial Cast gathered here have been in similar films to this one but often with better results. ""August: Osage County"" feels like a mix of ""Steel Magnolias,"" ""Moonstruck,"" and even ""Sordid Lives."" Meryl Streep, the vulgar Protagonist here, is a little bit of Karen Silkwood, Miranda Priestly, and Joan Crawford rolled into one character - given to long speeches and bizarre behavior with some serious overacting thrown in. Julia Roberts is equally unhinged  and despite her lack of makeup and vanity, she still manages to pose beautifully, while overacting up a storm. The lesser characters fare better: Chris Cooper and Ewan McGregor are two husbands broken down by their brutal wives - and Misty Upham is wonderful as a Native American who comes to work for the family. The best performance is from Julianna Nicholson, heartbreaking as the quiet and devastating Ivy Weston. Benedict Cumberbatch is equally moving in a small but pivotal role. The most annoying characters are the other two Weston daughters: Margo Martinale as the fat, over-twangy Maddie Fae and Juliette Lewis as Karen - a dimwit with little to say. Abigal Breslin, as Roberts' daughter is wasted. Aside from the Cast, this is an ugly, confrontational story with little of the dark humor that Tracy Letts (who wrote the script, oddly enough)conveyed so well in the play.

6138106,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"Streep/Roberts...who can argue that these two actresses have earned their stars. This movie, however, shows dysfunction at it's worst--after a funeral, which always seems to bring out people's true characters. This film also shows how far abuse carries, in this case, we hear from Streep's character about a much wanted Christmas present and what really happened when she received ""it."" Her sister is also an emotionally abusive person. Of Streep's three daughters, Barbara seems to have inherited her mother's emotional abuses, as she is also abusive towards her daughter and soon to be ex husband. Ivy, Barbara's sister is the stoic one, who, at age 50, just wants to leave the care of her abusive and dying mother to someone else and Karen is trying to validate the love she never had with her parents  by dating ALL the time. If you the viewer have lived through emotional abuse, this film will ring true. If not, you will feel extremely uncomfortable being drawn into these scenes of raw pain. My only ""complaint"" is that Sam Shepherd is a great actor and we only see him in the first few minutes of the film. I wish his role had been expanded somewhat...but his acting in those few minutes is what carries the pain of lost ""what could have beens"" through the film. The ending will leave you with many questions, but perhaps that is best....as we know, in many abusive/dysfunctional homes, there is no ""happy ever after,"" and perhaps this film --by leaving many strings untied....proves that.",1436313600,,1497,4.84765625

6138110,2,B00H7LJ2UO,"A few spoilers ahead. There's no doubt that there is a lot of great acting in the film. Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts are fantastic. The story was good but I felt like none of the characters ever really developed. It's as if the surface of a good story was scratched but never truly delved into.

All the men are written as victims of these crazy women they love. Even the guy who cheats with a younger woman blames his wife. All of the women in this film are a mess except maybe the maid. Seriously none of them are likable. One is a cruel pill popper, the other is a controlling, berating adulteress, one daughter is living with her head so far up in the clouds that she even stays with a man that gropes her teenage niece, one is so desperate for a man she'll even take family and the last one is very inconsiderate and has very little empathy.

The acting was outstanding but I found the story dreary and with no closure or redemption. The end left me wondering what happens and why I spent 2 hours watching a family be horrible to each other only to have none of them evolve or change or learn anything. Instead they all go back to doing exactly what they were before. It made me wonder why I even watched it. The acting was great by all but the story was depressing and unresolved. 2 stars from me.

6138135,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"""August: Osage County"" is even better the second time around. When I first watched this drama last summer; I thought it was good but nothing spectacular. But then I kept thinking about this film mostly because of the impeccable acting by Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. I finally broke down and bought the film on DVD and I'm very thrilled I decided to give this underrated gem another viewing. 3 ""ingredients"" make this film a standout. 1.) The acting. 2.) The writing. 3.) The plot. There's a lot of arguing amongst this dysfunctional family. The only character I felt sorry for was Ivy, played brilliantly by Julianne Nicholson. And I kind of felt sorry for Karen played by Juliette Lewis because her character is so pathetic. But it's Streep and Roberts who make ""August: Osage County"" a memorable film. To be honest, Streep has always been a hit-or-miss for me acting wise, but she is AMAZING as the pill-popping and foul-mouthed, Violet. This family is brutally honest, and the family secrets that come to light are shocking. Even though this film is a drama, there are some hilarious moments. I highly recommend it.

Overall it was a horrible story, horribly acted, with a horrible ending. I actually couldn't watch the whole thing.

6138155,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"This all star ensemble includes triple Oscar winner Meryl Streep as volatile and toxic Violet Weston. Theatre writer and actor Sam Shepard plays her long suffering husband, Beverly, who is a respected poet and retired college professor past his prime. The late Misty Upham plays Johnna, a Native American young lady, who he hires to help around the house. When Bev goes missing, adult daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) calls her sister Barbara Fordham (played by Oscar winner Julia Roberts) who brings her husband Bill (Ewan MacGregor) and their teenage daughter Jean (played by Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin). Violet's sister Mattie Fae Aitken (played by Emmy winner Margo Martindale) and her husband Charlie (played by Oscar winner Chris Cooper are also here. The third sister Karen is played by Oscar nominee Juliette Lewis and brings her fianc&eacute; Dermot Mulroney.

I saw the Broadway production with Oscar winner Estelle Parsons as Violet. She replaced the original Violet played by Tony winner Deanna Dunagan at Steppenwolf and on Broadway. Meryl's Violet is a force of nature like an Oklahoma tornado. Meryl puts her own stamp on this role. Julia Roberts played Barbara, the eldest daughter, with perfection. It must be tough to go up against Meryl in anything. Julianne Nicholson's Ivy is done subtly and gently as the caretaker daughter. Juliette Lewis is a revelation as Meryl puts it. She captures Karen with optimism despite feeling like an outcast in her own family. In the Weston family, the female characters rule the roost. Margo Martindale's Mattie Fae is believable as Violet's sister.

The male characters here take a backseat to the toxic family dysfunction. Oscar winner Chris Cooper plays Charlie as a bereaved man who lost his best friend and possibly his brother. Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch plays Little Charlie as a sympathetic and kind character but his mother's disappointment. Ewan MacGregor plays Bill Fordham, a college professor in Boulder, Colorado. Barbara married a man like her father. Dermot Mulroney plays mysterious Steve, Karen's fianc&eacute;.

If you read or seen the play in performance, it was quite a theatrical event. To see the film version, there are noticeable differences between the two productions. They edited out some dialogue for time and moved the events to a house in Oklahoma where it is set and filmed. The playwright Tracy Letts adapted the screenplay and made minor changes. The film still holds most of the important revelations and is true to the original play.

Now the DVD offers a few extras like the making of the movie, deleted scenes, commentary, and writing with Tracy Letts. I would have liked if they had included a stage production too. I am a true supporter in filming stage productions and releasing them to audiences after a finished run. Some people like myself can't handle seeing a theatrical productions for various reasons.",1430611200,,2915,5.156448202959831

6138157,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"Phenomenal acting by the entire cast. Not for the squeamish or perhaps those who grew up in highly dysfunctional families, but it's a roller coaster from start to finish. One of my favorite films.",1430265600,,196,4.794117647058823
6138158,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"I first became aware of the play, upon which this film is based, when I was still living in NYC and it was a hit on Broadway.  For some reason, the title turned me off and so I had no interest in seeing it.  I finally saw this film for the first time while it was still in theaters in Erie County, New York.  The film deals with heavy subject matter (drug addiction, suicide, incest; abuse; toxic / dysfunctional relationships).  The antagonist Violet Weston (Meryl Streep) tapes the window shades shut to block out the light; the interior of the house is dark from the outset and the weather is brutally hot .....

""August Osage County"" offers up the nightmarish reality of a family who doesn't know how to love one another.  Watching this film is like experiencing a compilation of the worst of every Thanksgiving and / or Christmas holiday dinner that anyone's ever been through.  No matter how each of these people has succeeded in life, and even if they've managed to transcend the baggage of their upbringing. they prey upon each other subconsciously / unconsciously.  Meryl Streep gives an outstanding performance as Violet and the cast -- Featuring Chris Cooper, Juliette Lewis, Margo Martindale, Dermot Mulroney and Misty Upham among others, is uniformly excellent.  Julia Roberts (Barbara Weston-Fordham) gets the chance to show some more range than has been the case in most of her previous films.

The viewing experience is ultimately primal; it holds up a mirror to life.  It's a brutally real film that doesn't end on a hopeful note.  Any humor displayed by the characters just disguises issues that are simmering beneath the surface.  Even in nature, mothers (like Violet) push their babies out of the nest; or sacrifice one so that the other will live / thrive.  Thus the message of this film ends up being: ""When life gets tough, the tough get going"".  All of it ends up being Darwinistic in that ""only the strong survive"". except it's questionable as to whether any of these characters are actually strong (with the exception of Johnna, the Native American housekeeper).

Recommended for people who enjoy drama, tragedy and serious films in general.  I also read the play after seeing this; the film sticks very closely to the script of the Pulitzer Prize wining drama.

6138203,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"Tracy Letts is one of today's finest playwrites, in a class with Alan Ball and Aaron Sorkin. The son of novelist Billie Letts, he has created several remarkable plays, two of which have been succesfully turned into films: ""Bug"" and this masterpiece: ""August: Osage County.""
  This is a story about a family reunion in a way that is reminiscent of Edward Albee without copying him at all. The entire Weston family is brought together by the death of the father and for two hours we are taken on a journey of pain, love and discovery.
  Meryl Streep is, as always, remarkable, but the most impressive performance comes out of Julia Roberts who is forced across a line the rest of the family has already crossed. It is her who carries this film and as each horrifying family secret is revealed it is through Roberts that we feel the effect.
  This is a brilliant play and has transferred to film just as brilliantly. Letts wrote the screenplay and it's clear he intends to tell of life in the south as he jpins the ranks of Tennesee Williams, Truman Capote, Mark Twain, William Styron and William Faulkner.

The only thing good about it was that it was over.  I waded thru it to the end, hoping there was some shred of positive anything that would come from this....some personal growth or realization....but no.
The only reason I even gave it 3 stars was the acting.  Streep is marvelous, of course, as are the other actors.

Dark & depressing, I strongly recommend against it unless you're into the acting....and even then, the storyline is so painful, I'm not sure it's worth investing the time.",1423958400,,679,5.026785714285714

6138239,2,B00H7LJ2UO,"I have to admit that I turned off this movie about 3/4s of the way through it as it was just not worth watching anymore.  The blurb says this movie is ""darkly hilarious,"" but it's only half right; it's very dark and not at all hilarious.  It has a wonderful cast of actors, but I have no idea why they signed on to do this movie or why it was nominated for awards.  It is just one long dark messed up movie that, as it goes on, just starts tasting worse and worse and you don't even care enough about the characters to want to finish it.  I wanted to like this movie and the ads for it looked good...but, nope.

The movie is basically about a husband and wife where the wife, Violet (Streep) has mouth cancer and is doped up on pills most of the time and is pretty nasty.  The husband leaves and the wife calls in the family, including her daughters (one played by Julia Roberts), to help out.  The family all pours in and most of them are messed up, self-centered, and not very bright.  The movie revolved around sniping and crying and sadness and regret until it seems like there is nothing good at all in this family (or life in general) and really leaves you feeling bummed out.  Not even the appearances of some of my loved actors such as Juliette Lewis, Ewan McGregor or Benedict Cumberpatch in the movie could entice me to finish it.

This is about a seriously dysfunctional family and I've watched movies like before, such as What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but this one was so dark and so uncaring that it seemed to have nothing much going for it.  I can't recommend this movie and I certainly have no intention of popping it back in to try and finish it.  There are way better things to spend my time on.",1422921600,,1711,4.279503105590062

6138250,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"Watching the first 40 minutes of August: Osage County (which was honestly sort of boring and failed to accomplish anything meaningful) nothing and I mean NOTHING could've prepared me for the incredible turnaround in storytelling quality that would occur just as soon as a certain dinner table family gathering takes place after a funeral.  A big chunk of the story is about Meryl Streep who's overmedicated and dying of cancer.  She's angry and bitter, and doesn't mind being exceptionally belligerent towards her family and embarrassing them as a result of a really rough childhood and what she considers spoiled ungrateful children who never had a life anywhere near as rough as the one she had to go through.  At first her belligerence is light-hearted and comparable to say, Vicki Lawrence's role in Mama's Family, but my goodness does her anger ever intensify to new ruthless and vicious heights!

The three daughters that make up her children are all *extremely* good in their role with wildly different personalities, the most notable being the always sharp and equally vicious Julia Roberts.  Let me tell you, I never thought Julia Roberts was that great and considered her sort of overrated all these years with the major exceptions being Erin Brockovich and Sleeping With the Enemy which are definitely two terrific films, but here?  In August: Osage County?  She absolutely NAILS a magnificent performance the likes of which I never knew she had inside of her!  She two eventually becomes a MONSTER of anger, unlady-like swear words and bitterness.

Of course anyone who's watched at least one or two movies starring Meryl Streep knows VERY well just how incredible of an actress she is.  She can nail any performance with natural ease and she delivers flawlessly once again here.  Seriously I was watching this movie tonight carefully and analyzing her facial expressions, hand movements and reaction to questions/comments whenever her daughters were getting under her skin.  She's a natural actress.  Deciding between Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep is a really tough decision and I'm NOT going to pick which one was better.  They both blew me away.  It's rare when one person has an excellent performance but two?  Now that's crazy!

Anyway, I'm getting so lost in mentioning the actors/actresses and how much they left an amazing impression on me, I'm unintentionally getting away from the plotline of the film!  There's more taking place here besides Meryl Streep just being shamelessly and brutally honest.  There's a reason for it.  After the funeral of Meryl's husband, the family completely falls apart.  The comedy is only present in the first portion of the movie- all humor goes away after the memorable dinner table scene I mention above.  Oh and about that dinner table scene?  What makes it so great is how the tension between all the family members builds in such a subtle way that you just KNOW it's only a matter of time until all the potshots and ignorance spills over and everyone comes undone, haha.  There's a reason we don't go around saying what we're thinking, lol.  Would lead to nothing but fights!  This is what the family life is like for some though.  Nobody can keep a secret from Meryl!

Anyway Juliette Lewis and Julianne Nicholson are the other two sisters, both magnificent and distinct in their roles as well.  Juliette's more of a city girl who can't wait to go to Belize with her husband (personality-wise very similar to Naomi from Mama's Family) and Juliette... well she's the emotional one with her own (VERY BIG) secrets and dilemmas that I can't even drop a hint about or it would spoil everything, which makes up the second half of the movie.  So basically the first 40 minutes are forgettable, the dinner scene was so memorable I honestly lost track of time since my eyes were glued to the TV screen (I think it was 30 minutes long) and the dilemmas that occur afterwards with the sisters (I won't spoil anything, I promise!) are all fantastic moments of the movie.  Seriously the more I think about it, this movie isn't really humorous at all.

Also worth noting- Misty Upham plays the role of the Native American housekeeper.  I didn't know when Misty died last year who she really was, but watching her role in this movie (which seems small and insignificant at first but it's actually much bigger in a couple crucial roles later on) makes me realize just how sad it is that she died.  RIP Misty.  Abigail Breslin always stars in memorable movies... usually ones that combine realistic and emotionally-charged dramas with subtle and innovative elements of comedy like this one, and she succeeds once again.  However her role is fairly limited to a dope-addicted teenager.  She's not nearly as critical to the storytelling as Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts characters.  She doesn't need to be either- obviously the friction building between the mother, the aunt (played by Margo Martindale) and the daughters takes center stage here.

The first 40 minutes are forgettable.  Do NOT let those unmemorable first 40 minutes discourage you.  Keep watching August: Osage County until the end!",1422057600,,5143,4.9406286379511055

6138258,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"Count your blessings, the original Pulitzer Prize winning play had a running time of three and a half hours (compared to the pared down movie version of a mere two hours).  In any case, I can't imagine that it would require that much time to demonstrate what a disreputable family this is, from the youngest to the oldest, they are all sadly bereft of any semblance of decency.  At the beginning, when Sam Shepard lazily drawls ""life is very long,"" what he really meant was, watching this movie will age you in dog years to a point of wishful extinction.
This film is intensely vicious, a never ending festival of obscenity, scandals aplenty, rants to ruin, and uncompromising ugliness on a scale that has been done before, and better.  Case in point, Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night.  It's also a Pulitzer Prize winner, also featuring a drug addicted mother and an alcoholic father.  There's nothing new about that plot.  The only difference here is an entire family of reprobates with only one innocent (Misty Upham as Johnna Monevata) in the bunch.  Yes, it features a stellar cast (although I do think both Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep are vastly overrated) and the photography/cinematography is excellent.  It is not a fun film to watch.  Most of the action is confined to a house of horrors.  That actually works in their favor.  It gives one the feeling of being trapped in a never ending nightmare of gloom and doom.  To designate it a black comedy/drama though, gives it far too much credit.  Very little about this film and these people is amusing.  These are mean people given to saying mean things and not caring about the obvious repercussions.  Nothing about this film is entertaining.  It is, however, unremittingly fascinating.  It's nice to see that other families can be horrific on a whole other level, making ours look all the more benign.

6138263,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"Please read the other reviews for a description of the movie plot.

I didn't watch this movie. I lived in it. And when it was done I crawled back into my own life again. For me this movie was a positive catharsis. It validated my own struggles growing up in a dysfunctional family. Violet is not your average iron fisted matriarch. She is that on steroids. An acid mouthed character who has cancer in her mouth. The cancer actually does create a continual acid taste she drowns in booze and pills.

The movie begins with Violet's husband Beverly explaining his marital agreement to her new caretaker Johnna. Violet is allowed to take her confabulation of prescriptions at will. And Bev is allowed to drink his alcohol as needed. This agreement had worked for quite some time until Bev could no longer find joy in drinking. I noticed a tear on the side of Sam Shepherd's face as he calmly explained.

Then Beverly hands Johnna a book of TS Eliot's poems. Eliot fans like myself know his most popular poem is ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"". It is narrated by an older man who feels the ""butt end"" of his days... Exactly how Bev feels. And now his alcohol is no longer a refuge. So, like everyone who is affected when one person rules a family with their bad behavior, Bev had to find another way to cope with the pain. I thought that was an absolutely brilliant beginning for this movie.

I loved this movie. I am giving it five stars. I wish I could give it a thousand. The writers were spot on. The producers hired cream-of-the-crop actors to show indescribable human behavior. Behavior that has to be modeled to be understood as a mere conversation won't do. Nobody who survives a Narcissistic family system is able to describe what it is like in mere words. The ""rules"", the heaping discomforts, the territories, the tactics, the smirks, the control issues, the avoidance of truth at all costs. It has to be shown. And that is what you get in this movie. One of the best movies I have ever seen.

I hope there is Oscar gold for Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. They both deserve it.",1421107200,3,2090,4.503957783641161

The family dynamics that may seem strange to some but actually happen within situations like this.  One scene in particular was a dinner scene.  All kinds of crazy things were being said and done - and then someone in the family tried to switch the conversation to something general like the weather or sports or something like that.  I had to laugh because trying to change the topic is one way family members deal with hostile situations sometimes.

Another scene that was pretty interesting is when Julia Roberts just automatically kicked into ""let's get mom's drugs"" out of here.

If this is the best that Hollywood can do nowadays, I'd be happy to watch the phantom of the opera movie that the kid was watching. It seems that incest, juvenile rape, and all the other dysfunctions that could exist in a ""family"" are acceptable enough to be displayed proudly as Oscar worthy material. Frankly as a creative individual myself I feel disgusted, that this is so. I expect more from Clooney. I will say that the Indian actress does a good job in this movie, and feel it a shame that she left too early. And little miss sunshine, is certainly growing up as an actor.

6138348,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"If you are not a fan of films that begin with a suicide and end with the main character sobbing alone, then maybe avoid this. It is a bleak portrait of family dysfunction, featuring a lot of unlikeable characters. However, if you're game, this is a remarkably well done film.
Based on the play by Tracy Letts (And adapted by him), it has a KILLER script. I can not emphasize this enough. The dialogue is very natural, and very well-written; it can break your heart one minute, and make you laugh extremely uncomfortably. However, there are moments when the thing can feel a bit stagey; Letts did not do enough to properly translate it into film.
The acting is the real star of this piece: Meryl Streep continues to prove that she can do no wrong. She is an absolute terror as Violet Weston, and one of the most unlikeable characters in cinematic memory. Julia Roberts is also shockingly good as the eldest daughter, playing another vicious character; it is unlike anything she has ever done. Other highlights include Margo Martingale as the brassy yet flawed Aunt Mattie Fae, Julianne Nicholson as the misunderstood middle child, and Chris Cooper as Mattie Faes long-suffering husband. Also worth noting is Juliette Lewis, who does some of her best work as Karen, the youngest sister and possibly the most annoying character in the film. Everyone in this piece is exceptional.
The films centerpiece is its dinner scene, a 12-minute marathon of family drama. The film begins to feel claustrophobic at this point, which  is a unique effect. The film, unlike the play, leaves the house multiple times, and it does somewhat slow the momentum.
Overall though, despite its few flaws, this is an excellent film, strengthened by its actors. I recommend itjust be warned that this is not the typical family movie.",1417478400,,1804,4.8381877022653725

The 2014 movie ""August: Osage County"", about a family in collective grief and individual crises, features towering performances by Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor, Julianne Nicholson, Juliette Lewis, Abigail Breslin, Benedict Cumberbatch, Margo Martindale, Dermot Mulroney, Misty Upham, and Sam Shepard. Based on the play by Tracy Letts (the CIA Director on TV's ""Homeland"") who also did the screenplay, the movie concerns an Oklahoma plains family coming together on the occasion of the death of one of the family patriarchs. Streep is a wild, addicted widow who loves being the center of attention as two of her three daughters and other family members arrive at her home after long absences in preparation for the funeral. But in the middle of the sorrowful occasion, especially at a raucous post-funeral meal complete with unrestrained profanity-laced diatribes, secrets are revealed, hearts are broken, and relationships could be changed. Directed by John Wells, this movie is 2 hours of slowly-revealed, searing revelations as the family learns much about each other as grownups. I've watched it 3 times. My Highest Recommendation.

6138367,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"A painful portrait of a dysfunctional family, but the viewer is impelled by both extraordinary performances and a compelling (and instructional) analysis of how dysfunctional families operate.

According to this film, parents, especially mothers, who are frustrated by their own lives look to their children to be what they could not be. Since the children inevitably fail to be the parent, the parents grow ever more frustrated with their children and themselves.  This is simplistic. My guess is that the causes are usually more complicated.

This causal analysis doesn't play much of a role in the film. More important and much better is the portrayal of the way the dysfunctional family operates. Family members know each other well enough to know each other's vulnerabilities.  In this dysfunctional family, the grown children will not share the details of their lives with their mother because they realize that she will call attention to them publicly and ridicule them painfully.  Though grown, children still need to protect themselves.  But the mother is smart enough and knows her children well enough to discover the vulnerabilities on her own.  Once exposed, the children's hopes for a happier future are dashed.  However, here the kids are able to unite and subdue the mother.  They get her off of the pills that are exacerbating the problem.  Even so, they cannot transform her personality or regain their own hopes--and it is clear that the mother will not stay off the pills very long.  What is implausible here is that the children would be able to reveal their vulnerabilities to each other and unite, even briefly, to take charge of their mother. Dysfuntionalism is generally passed on, a point the film seems to make.",1416787200,,1738,5.063157894736842

6138385,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"I just want to add something about understanding this movie (and most likely the play upon which it is based) that is not reflected in the reviews I have read here and that is that the pain and suffering embodied in this drama is very true to a kind of pain and suffering you can find probably in the history, even if not recent, of just about any family.  It is the kind of suffering that sets in and requires generations to grow out of.  It comes from poverty, parental cruelty (emotion, physical and probably sexual abuse) and its hallmarks are everything you see in the characters in this movie from lack of sibling warmth to addiction to problems with intimacy.  At its most perplexing is the inseparable combination of cruelity and suffering, sibling connectedness and broken attachment.  This is life where nurture is crucified as often as can be done and still the cold mechanics of family marches on.  This story very much takes up the work of further illuminating what was shown in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.

There is a central thread of Julia Roberts character growing into a conscious awareness of all of this at great personal cost.  This plot thread is perhaps the only thing for the audience to hold onto as a hope for the future of this broken family.  This is a hard movie to watch but unless you are too enmeshed in this sort of familial suffering, you will find it compelling.  The acting is amazing.  If you are not familiar with some of the types of generational suffering depicted here you may find this movie too much and too over the top.  However, I am sorry to say, real life shines through here in the sort of concentrated form that good story-telling should achieve.",1415577600,7,1706,4.578947368421052

6138426,2,B00H7LJ2UO,"I'm sure this worked better as a stage play, but as a film with an overstuffed star cast it never really gelled.  As a ""dark comedy"" I never laughed at moments clearly intended to be awkwardly funny, and the presence of so many high profile stars playing against type ended up distracting.  Lots of ""ACTING!!!!"" from Roberts and Streep - they both give ""raw,"" ""emotional"" performances that probably needed more nuance or a director who could reign them in.  Like I said, I never saw the play and despite my reservations there are some lovely moments by veteran actors such as Chris Cooper, who remains a national treasure in yet another supporting role.  He and the other supporting players really bring their A game including an underused Sam Shepard, that other national treasure Margo Martindale and a surprisingly nuanced turn by Juliette Lewis.  Structurally it FEELS like a stage play trying to be a movie, and the attempts to ""open"" the narrative cinematically instead of keeping it within the tight, claustrophobic space of the family home worked against the material, especially when the big emotional ""reveals"" kick into high gear.  Had the film opened up the fates of it's many characters in turn, perhaps it would have all come together as a film on its own merits instead of a movie that seemed to coast on it's lauded origins.  It's failure is a shame since smaller-scale, intimate ensemble pieces haven't been represented much in Hollywood since the passing of the great Robert Altman.

6138447,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"'August: Osage County' was a riveting story about a very dysfunctional family living in the great plains.  Members of the clan include parents Violet and Beverly; daughters Barbara, Ivy and Karen; Violet's sister Mattie Fae and her husband Charles; their son Little Charles; and Barbara's estranged husband and daughter.

The movie centers on the disappearance and soon after death of the patriarch of the family, Beverly, and how it uncovers the raw personalities of the rest of the family.  The movie is filled with repressed love, hatred, disappointment, scandal, and other emotions.  When you watch it, you will be transfixed by how intense the scenes are, without them actually covering very much ground in the story.  The scene at the dinner table after the funeral and the the scene between the three sisters are especially notable.

This is clearly a character drama which was meant for the stage, and, in fact, it was based upon a play.  So if you like movies that cover ground physically and have involved storied which include plot twists and the like, then this one isn't for you.  But if you want to feel as though you are seeing a real family's life and experience all the raw emotion that comes with it, then this one is for you.

The performances by Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts are simply outstanding; however, none of the other actors should be diminished, since it is the ensemble that makes the movie.

This one was well worth watching and I would highly recommend it.",1413072000,2,1490,4.807843137254902

6138465,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"I love ALL of the actors in this film, what a great cast. And they all did a fantastic job. But damn, the story was depressing and dark. Meryl and Margot play awful mothers and wives, and we learn that it's due to their own crappy upbringing. We see the abuse being passed on to the next generation through Julia's character and Julia's character seeing herself in her awful mother, Meryl's character.

There is no disputing that Meryl Streep is phenomenal in every role she plays, but I didn't like her in this film. She plays a very sick woman addicted to all sorts of prescription drugs and she's a mess. There was nothing sympathetic about her, which is the point of her character, but I wondered if she didn't play drugged-up-sick-woman very well. Hard to say. Who am I to criticize Meryl Streep, but I wasn't buying some of her scenes.

I had a hard time with this film because I have a really low tolerance for abusive people, awful mean parents disrespecting their children and putting them down all of the time. So this film was hard to watch. But, honestly, the writers of this story and the actors did an excellent job portraying these very real dynamics. If you're looking for mainstream AMC Theater-type entertainment, look elsewhere (despite the illustrious cast).

I'm not going to go into any movie details because enough has already been written in these reviews about the story/plotline but what I will say is it is worth a one time shot at viewing just to see what is unbelievable, every clich about dysfunctional families is congregated x 1000 with no room to breathe in a room full of vile mouth breathers. I do respect the fact that at no time is sugar poured on this family and that they stay true to their sour nature all the way through and I find that refreshing for a Hollywood movie. All I am left with after shutting off the dvd player is a wishing for a drone strike to have hit that family before they all scattered to the four winds, no real loss at their utter demise would have been felt other than a hole where their home once stood.",1412121600,,1089,4.240384615384615

6138480,2,B00H7LJ2UO,"Great comedy-dramas have been written about conflicted people coming together in one house - like 'Cat On A Hot Tin Roof' - but this hysterical soap opera isn't one of them. The huge difference between all the great ones, and this, is that all the people involved in the drama need to have a very good reason to stay together in the one space. In 'Cat' it's a desire for power and money on the one hand, and a desire for the two people who love Big Daddy, on the other hand; to keep a deadly secret that he knows nothing of. Among other things. So the conflict has conviction when the secrets are revealed. But there's no real reason why all these characters should, or would, put up with the abuse dished out by Meryl Streep - at her worst, in this. Somebody would get up from the table, pour a glass of water over Mommy, get in their car, and leave. But they remain, to be abused by a character that everyone despises. The only two performers who get the tone right are Juliette Lewis and Dermot Mulroney, who seem to be acting in a much better film. And they're both really good. Everyone else seems to think the film they're all in, is much better than it really is. In the theatre, at an hour longer, it seemed funnier, but on the screen, it's just an exhausting hamfest.",1412035200,,1276,4.2987551867219915

I own this movie, but I can't watch it everyday, due to the subject matter. But that doesn't take away from the wonderful acting job that was done to make this story unfold.

Each actor/actress did a great job, however the story was pointless.  Everyone is miserable, yelling at each other, and there is no resolution.  You don't feel any empathy for any of these people, there is no character development, and certain situations were added strictly for shock value even though you don't care enough about the characters to be shocked.

I love a movie that is believable and makes me think about it for days after viewing.  I rarely buy movies and in fact own less than a dozen.

6138523,5,B00H7LJ2UO,Great!!!,1410393600,,8,8.0
6138524,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"With an ensemble cast matched by very few movies over the years, the screen begins with what may be its best scene. Weston family patriarch and published poet Beverly (the always great Sam Shepard) is interviewing Johnna for a position as cook and housekeeper when they are interrupted in stunning fashion by Violet (Meryl Streep), Beverly's acid-tongued wife who is showing the effects of chemotherapy and her prescription drug addiction. This extraordinary pre-credits scene sets the stage for the entire movie, which unfortunately only approaches this high standard a couple more times.

Despite the film's flaws, there is no denying the ""train-wreck"" effect of not being able to look away from this most dysfunctional family. Most of this is due to the screen presence of a steady stream of talented actors: in addition to Streep and Shephard, we get their 3 daughters played by Julia Roberts (Barbara), Julianne Nicholson (Ivy) and Juliette Lewis (Karen); Ewan McGregor and Abigail Breslin as Roberts' husband and daughter; Margo Martindale (Violet's sister), her husband Chris Cooper (Charles) and their son Benedict Cumberbatch.

As with most dysfunctional family movies, there is a dinner table scene ... this one occurring after a funeral. The resentment and regret and anger on display over casseroles is staggering, especially the incisive and ""truth-telling"" Violet comments and the defensive replies from Barbara. As time goes on, family secrets and stories unfold culminating in a whopper near the end. This is really the polar opposite of a family support system.

Meryl Streep's performance is one of the most demonstrative of her career. Some may call it over the top, but I believe it's essential to the tone of the movie and the family interactions. Her exchanges with Julia Roberts define the monster mother and daughter in her image theme. They don't nitpick each other, it's more like inflicting gaping wounds. Surprisingly, Roberts mostly holds her own ... though that could be that the film borders on campy much of the time. Streep's scene comes as she recalls the most horrific childhood Christmas story you could ever want to hear.

It must be noted that Margo Martindale is the real highlight here. She has two extraordinary scenes ... each very different in style and substance ... and she nails them both. Without her character and talent, this film could have spun off into a major mess. The same could be said for Chris Cooper, who is really the moral center of the family. While the others seem intent on hiding from their past, he seems to make the best of his situation.

The film never really captures the conflicting environments of the old Weston homestead and the wide open plains of Oklahoma. The exception is a pretty cool post-funeral scene in a hayfield where Roberts tells Streep ""There's no place to go"". Still, it's one of the more entertaining and wild dysfunctional comedy-dramas that you will see on screen, and it's quite obvious this group of fine actors thoroughly enjoyed the ensemble experience.",1410393600,,3049,5.077844311377246

6138590,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"...after a family patriarch kills himself. And, nope...this plot detail isn't even close to being a spoiler.

This is a film that certainly won't be for everybody. If you are troubled by sensitive topics (to include suicide, alcoholism, drug addiction, physical abuse, emotional abuse, infidelity and incest): this movie won't be for you. If you are troubled by dysfunctional families populated by either toxic or failing relationships: this movie won't be for you. If you watch movies in the hope that the main characters will emerge from the story to move themselves in unsuspecting ways: this movie won't be for you (pretty much what you see is what you get from the jump).

Its origins as a play are evident as the story is advanced almost exclusively by dialog exchanged in the dark, cluttered and sweltering Osage County home of Beverly and Violet Westin. Beverly is a poet --apparently of some renown-- whose craft has been set aside in favor of drinking. Vi is his chain smoking, pill-addled wife, recently diagnosed with mouth cancer. They have been joined in their home by a native American housekeeper,  Johnna, hired to help care for Vi as she faces chemotherapy. In the movie's opening, Beverly mentions the unspoken contracts that mark long marriages. He names one of theirs (his drinking, her pills), and leaves no doubt that we are about to learn more.

And then he disappears into the bottom of a lake, prompting the return of his three adult daughters (one separated, but with her spouse and teenage daughter in tow, one engaged and with her Ferrari-driving Miami fiance tagging along and one apparently single...but more will be revealed about this).  For  most movies this would be the peak of darkness. In this one: it's just the beginning.

What follows is a crucible of anger, accusations, profane and high-volume kvetching as the extended clan of Westin gals (and the men that travel in their orbits) engage in a series of escalating verbal and physical assaults on each other, each claiming to be more affronted by life than the others.

In the end, nobody is redeemed, nobody is revealed to be any better --or worse-- than we might have thought at the beginning. And if you though alcoholism, drug use, cancer and suicide were a grim way to start a movie, then you underestimate the power of this dysfunctional crowd to hurt each other.

Worth watching for the acting and writing, but don't expect any surprising insights into the power of love and families to get past pain. These people are suffering and miserable, they freely share their pain and misery with each other...and stay there. They swim in their misery until bitter end, when the secrets revealed in their shouted confessions leave them more damaged than when the movie started.",1408838400,,2769,4.89957264957265

The rest of the characters never evolved into anything interesting. I struggled to get through this movie and I mean, struggled!

6138691,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"Of course the acting is good, but overall the movie did not do much for me -- and not because I disliked the dark, abrasive nature of the story.  The point of the story just did not gel for me, when all is said and done.  Part of what killed it for me was the vague way the film ended.  I didn't fully follow what Julia Roberts' character was thinking when she hugged her mother but then stormed out of the house (after the mother essentially confided her own role in her husband's suicide) and I didn't understand why her character smiled after driving to the place where her father's body had been found (what epiphany did she have?) or where exactly she was headed when the film ended.  Is she returning to her mother, or abandoning her as everyone else has (with good cause)?

Clearly there are lessons to be learned from this tragic story of a grossly dysfunctional family:  the film would have been much better if it had helped the viewer ""get"" these lessons.

I did experience one very personal connection to the story:  the daughters feel more empathy for their mother (Meryl Streep's character) when they learn of the cruel Christmas present the mother once received from HER mother (the daughters' grandmother).  This reminded me of a cruelty my own mother practiced upon me the Christmas of my sophomore year in high school.

At that time my mother was struggling to launch a real estate company she probably had no business starting, and money was tight.  I had a job at Long John Silvers, but a lot of good it did me because as soon as I began earning my own money my mother thought of ways to spend it:  i.e., she quit buying me pretty much everything she had supplied before, stuff like clothes, make-up, etc.  I liked working and earning my own keep, so I didn't complain -- but of course it was disappointing and hurtful to realize my mother resented me having any money of my own.  It also perplexed me that a parent would not realize what a DIS-INCENTIVE TO WORK she was creating.  I mean, why work at all if you don't ultimately get any financial benefit? (Just saying)

Anyway, for several years the only type of Christmas presents we had been getting were things like underwear and socks, so none of us expected much that year.  But weeks before the holiday my mother began making a huge deal about how surprised I was going to be at the fabulous present she had for me (and only me).  I was definitely the family scapegoat, so it was weird and unusual that she would single me out for a present better than what my father and brother were getting.  Indeed, my brother (who was completely pampered and clearly the favorite) was resentlful and jealous that my mother kept hyping what I was getting.

On Christmas day my father and brother received socks and underwear while I received one small package only: it contained a page torn out of the JC Penney catalog with a handwritten note excitedly proclaiming that the item pictured on the catalog page had been ordered for me and would arrive in a matter of weeks.  The item in question was one I had oogled and sighed over for several weeks when we received the catalog (knowing, of course, that owning it was out of the question): a light brown rabbit fur coat with a real fox tail for a collar.  I would never as an adult wear fur -- and this coat may not sound much to any of you reading this review -- but all I can say is that the coat captured my imagination, and defined for me (at that time) all which was classy, understated glamour.

When I opened my present, I had no idea what to think.  SURELY there was no way my mother was actually going to purchase this coat for me.  But she went on and on about how much she had sacrificed to do this ""special thing"" for me and was very convincing (as con artists often are), such that she finally persuaded me that she really had done this wonderful, unexpected thing for me and that yes, in fact, the coat was on order.  I was ecstatic!  And for days I felt guilty and ashamed that I had ever questioned whether my mother loved me, or thought ill of her for her often callous and unjust treatment.  Anyone who would sacrifice like that to buy me the coat of my dreams was obviously a beautiful, loving person and I HAD BEEN SO WRONG about her.  How shameful!

But, alas, the reality is that it was all a hoax.  Everytime I asked about whether the coat was in, she would lie and tell me it had been back-ordered.  This went on for OVER TWO MONTHS.  Finally one day in early March we happened to be inside JC Penneys for some other reason and I grabbed her arm and marched her over to the catalog order counter.  (I am not a stupid person and I had already begun to expect that the coat had never been ordered.)  As we were standing in line waiting to ask about the order, my mother grew increasingly agitated until finally she burst out crying and screaming, ""Okay!  You got me!  I never ordered the coat!""  (sob, sob) ""You are SO CRUEL for doing this to me, making me stand in this line just so you can show me up!  It meant so much to me to make you happy at Christmas, why do you have to RUIN THAT by HUMILIATING me like this in PUBLIC no less?!!  You are such an UNGRATEFUL CHILD!!""  etc. etc.

This has continued to be her version of the story:  that she did this wonderful thing for me and I cruelly and insensitively threw it back in her face . . . when the reality is that at least my father and brother got socks and underwear whereas I got nothing but additional disillusionment.

Anyway.  My mother was not usually overtly (and openly) cruel like Meryl Streep's character, but she was definitely cruel in a premeditated passive-aggressive fashion.  Like the title of a book I once came across:  ""The Velvet Glove of Fascism"" which argued that more insidious than overt fascism is the fascism which hides and pretends it is a velvet glove (or something like that).",1406764800,,5898,4.388581952117864

Perhaps if you go into it thinking you're watching a big ""prestige Oscar"" film you could be disappointed; but think of it like a more expansive ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and I feel like this movie scarcely hits a false note. I say more expansive because, whereas ""Who's Afraid..."" focuses on the toxic yet binding love of a dysfunctional marriage, ""August"" gets the whole extended family into play, but with many of the same themes. Why do we attack those we need the most? How thin is the line between cruelty and love? The cast is phenomenal, as is the script. Not the easiest to watch but really hits on the pain of family secrets and brokenness and the difficulty of breaking free from toxic relationships while maintaining connection with family - we resent them and we often, easily become them!
By the way - one of Meryl Streep's boldest performances. I found it full of compassion even while facing her brutality. Julia Roberts is actually good as well, but the supporting cast is down-the-line fantastic.",1406678400,,1124,4.769230769230769

The movie is tighlly directed and focused on its theme.  The suicide scene, for example, is intimated through image and facial expression and is wordless.

6138703,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY is an interesting film for me. It was written by Tracy Letts, who also wrote two of my favorite William Friedkin films, BUG and KILLER JOE. It also has one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled, in my opinion. However, in contrast to the two William Friedkin films, this one doesn't feel as much like a play. That works for it, and against it. It works for it because the action isn't necessarily confined to one or two locations, and the narrative doesn't feel so claustrophobic. Still, that claustrophobic nature is what worked for those two, and here I thought the film could have benefited from feeling a little smaller. None of the scenes were bad, by any stretch, but a lot of them felt like padding. In other words, they were very much on the periphery of the central story. Still, the performances delivered by the cast were awards-worthy, especially Meryl Streep, who disappeared into her role as the Weston family matriarch.

 The story is quite simple: A family crisis arises in the Weston family, which prompts them to reunite at the family home in Osage County, Oklahoma. This serves as the catalyst for a lot of secrets to come out, which alter the relationships between them. In this respect, it's similar to Tracy Letts' other plays, because of a single incident that sets the plot in motion. Seemingly insignificant, it actually turns out to have a larger effect than it seemed to at first, with wider implications for everyone involved. Letts excels at making this type of intimate drama, although at times this particular adaptation devolves into histrionics and enters ""kitchen sink"" territory. By that, I mean that the intense dialogue exchanges often feel like actors putting on a show. Being mean-spirited is fine with me, but a lot of the time I could tell it was just actors acting. That being said, the cast was incredible. Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts were the two standouts, but my personal favorite was Margo Martindale as Mattie Fae. There was a down-home quality and naturalness to her performance that I can only assume comes from her as a person. I also thought Chris Cooper did an excellent job with his role as Uncle Charlie.

 Overall, while the acting is top-notch the story feels a little too large for the material being presented and despite the great cast, it often felt like an excuse for them to just riff off of each other instead of tell a story. This did make for some excellent individual scenes, though. For example, the dinner scene with the entire cast around the table felt real and honest, and is probably the closest the film got to what I liked about the previous Letts adaptations. The film could have been more stripped down, in my opinion, but the high-caliber cast and performances are enough to warrant a watch.",1406505600,,2797,4.748971193415638

6138783,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"Great movie.  Wonderful dialogue and excellently performed.  I think that anyone who has tried to escape the grips of growing up in a highly disfunctional family might appreciate the message behind this film.  Most of these characters are just trying desperately to escape their background and childhood past, but their attempts usually fail.  One tries to escape with pills, others with unsuitable partners or self-rightousness.  But just when they think they've made it out and are ready to leave the misery behind something happens or they receive some news that makes them realize they never actually escaped.  In the end however one of them actually does manage to turn their back completely on the misery of their past and move solely forward.  A movie that makes you think about one's responsibility to one's family vs one's responsibility to their own soul and what happens when those two things cannot co-exist.  This is not a happy go-lucky film, but it's unpredictable and there is a light at the end of the tunnel as we see one of them finally look across the field of their dysfunctional past and say goodbye for the last time.  Meryll Streep plays a hard-hearted woman who's endured a great deal of pain in her life and has no idea how to handle it.  Her performance is excellent and she manages to both make you dislike her as well as feel sorry for her.  Though many reviewers are calling this film depressing I actually found it only partly so.  It also has a dark comedic aspect to it and I found the ending to be upbeat and hopeful as we watch the person who had turned most like her mother finally turn her back on that and move forward with a smile.  Highly recommended.",1405209600,,1691,4.653198653198653
6138784,1,B00H7LJ2UO,"I suppose they decided to make the chick movie from Hades. We all respect these great actors, Chris Cooper my all time favorite. The one decent character in this pill popping, venomous , snarling, gut wrenching confession, dark secret brouhaha that makes Maury Povich looks like a Sunday School Class in the Mormon Church by comparison..oh and did I mention a shovel slapped up the side of the head just as an ""accent moment"".
Sometimes we try too hard to ""get noticed"" by our peers at the Academy. In trutyh, we really don't enjoy watchign peopel we lvoe grovel, slap, curse, wretch, and otherwise go post menopausal  female hormone haywire, screeching  desperadoes. This was just exhausting and demoralizing. Any of you out there ever suffered vicious emasculation from your mother? Here's a good one: this mother had an affair with the father in law, this incestuous sin resulted in a houng man whois sweet as he cn be, a lovign soul, but clumsy and inept, and will never do well in theworld..and this mother's vicious verbal castration of him in front of the entire family, at a funeral..is pure evil..taking her egregious sin out on a hapless child of hers for his poor pathetic life. Most of the chronically ill tempered, foul mouth emasculating women, who say thigns with their mouths no dedcent person would hold in their hand, all have men leaving their asexual, menopausal hatefulness for a younger woman...uuhhhh...and they wonder why? If this movie does nothing else, it should win an acadamy awar for portraying women in some other light than 'sugar and spice and everything ncie""...women can be devious, shallow, vain, ruthless, and mean as gila monsters. Now if there's an acadamy award for that..this film  will walk away with a half dozen oscars.
There IS a way to do a serious drama, write a serious drama. Take a look at Hellen Mirren in ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" by Tennesee Williams.  That is art. Woody Allen threw his hat in the ring about addicted, vain, wordly, vicious women in ""Blue Jasmine"", which seems oddly like a pretty ugly portrayal of Mia farrow's fin de ciecle. But for a good way to portray a 'woman wronged' one can also check out Hellen Mirren in ""The Tempest""..where at least, some wrongs are righted ""by unseen forces"" WE movie goers can take only so much endless ""spewing"" and wretching of hideousness...we have to have some kind of redemption,soem scintilla of relief... some sense that things can turn out well. Yet I suppose a lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse, has no other ending than torture in Hell after we finished our hideousness here on earth. Often when we see, hear, watch ugliness of this kind..we may bet our framed 2 dollar bill that the author who wring this angst from his tortured soul...di so with the help of vast quantities of alcohol.

There's no surprise to the ending.  Julia drives off, disgusted with her whole family - right after she shuts up her pill-addicted mother who's dying of horrible mouth cancer with a feigned embrace saying ""Yes, mom, you're the strongest"" meaning she isn't to the viewers  - pulls over to the side of the road in her cool, beat-up pickup truck, climbs out and looks at the beautiful landscape of the planes (which in the beginning of the movie she only has vile, f'g comments about, and the heat there as well) looks off into the beautiful landscape makes a smug smirk as if to say ""I'm the strongest one and I'm RIGHT to be rid of them all because I'm so superior.""  It's enough to make you vomit. Plus Julia Roberts looks so haggard and old and her face looks like it's carved out of absolute stone. And the way she eats and sticks out her long cow tongue and licks her lips throughout the dinner scene, it's like nothing you've ever seen before especially from the once deified, talentless Roberts.

But it wont, the punishment for living too long. I like men having sex with beautiful women, like Julia Roberts, but tastefully.  I rented this movie for my wife, not for me.
But I watched it with her; after all she watches my movies with me and then laughs when I try to do what they do in the moves, only very poorly.  I will say Meryl Streep again shows why she is such a great actress.  She really gets into her part.  Meryl Streep disappeared and the old angry, bad mouthed bitch took her place.  She was brilliant.  Julia Roberts was also fantastic in her role as the distraught and under achieving daughter.  Both complimented each other like few actresses can.  Julia Roberts started as just another pretty face but has bloomed into an actress that can fit into any part.  She is still one of the most beautiful women in the movie business but she doesnt rely on that.
This story is about angry women, and neutered men.  The men are descent, they are the type of men that most women want but only the bitches get.  They work hard, they are gentle, and they understand.  I wanted to slap the crap out them for not coming down on their wives for acting like they do. I wouldnt put up with it.  But in the movie, they do.
So you have the Patriarch of the family who dies, and this dysfunctional family comes together to morn his loss, or actually their loss of a really nice man.  Thus incuses conversation after conversation airing out more dirty laundry than Chinese cleaner could ever handle.  There is drinking, drugs, infidelity, and insidious relations all over the place.  Unfortunately they occur before the movie starts and nothing is shown.  The conversations were glib, fast and you have to listen to catch it. The acting is first rate and the movie as far as my wife was concerned was good.  I guess she likes to see a family more dysfunctional than ours.
This is a movie for women, many women will love it.  The men should watch it so they will see what a wonderful wife their wife actually is, unless one of the wives in the movie reminds him of his, I would get a divorce.  But that is not for me to say.

Spoiler alert: I found myself re-scripting what people said, only because I was hoping for a breakthrough, some firm honesty with kindness and love, but no compromises. There were few boundaries ever set in this family, and each coped in their own way, but not with love toward each other. How could they? They didn't know what it was, how it worked.
The takeaway is sometimes people have to leave a wicked parent behind. For more on this, read David Celani's Leaving Home, about that very hard choice.",1404691200,,776,4.630434782608695

6138860,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"A few years ago my husband, son, and I saw this show in NYC. We all left feeling it was the best stage production we've ever seen. The woman who played the mother (I can't remember her name, now) wasn't great, but Johanna Day was AMAZING!! I see a lot of live theatre and that production knocked me out.

When the movie came out, I wondered if it could measure up. I didn't go to the theater to see it -- whole family had planned to go on Christmas Day and then they delayed it and we never got around to going after that. And then when it was only nominated for 2 Academy Awards, I thought it must have bombed. But I was so wrong! Rented it on Amazon and LOVED it. I mean, how can you go wrong with Meryl Streep? Well, except perhaps that Abba musical she did -- NOT a fan of that one! Still, she's the best actress of her generation and either side of it as well. Julia Roberts is actually REALLY good in this. Everyone did an outstanding job. But Meryl, my goodness, she was amazing. She and Julia R. worked together beautifully. Chris Cooper, Margo Martindale, Sam Shepard, all terrific!

Of course there was a good bit added for the movie, and a scene or two left out, but thank goodness Tracy Letts wrote the screenplay. He's a genius.

It was a horrible movie - one of the worst I have ever seen.  Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.....",1403136000,,422,4.048192771084337
6138911,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"""August Osage County"" is not a computer-driven sci-fi, empty, over-edited film for the uneducated. This film is about the interior lives of people in a very typical family in America. People who thought this would be entertainment did not read the reviews or simply rented it or saw it thinking it would be a hoot.

The days of dim-witted flicks are passing..More and more life is flashing before us the horrible truth that we are not in a secure world at all, chiefly because of our inability to establish any kind of unity, politically or spiritually, our failure in our relationships with each other and with nature. Look at the climate, the air, the multiple diseases one can contract , and the sentimental, ignorant belief that something or someone will come out of the skies and give it all back to us on a silver platter. This will not happen, And ""August Osage County"" shows us the ER we are in, barely alive on life support systems. There are many such films, thank God, out there. Look at ""Blue Jasmine,"" ""The Dallas Buyers' Club,"" ""Killer Joe,"" ""Malicifant,"" even ""Frozen"" has the under- current of despair, granted the ending with its off beat portrayal of love. Check out the songs in ""Frozen,"" experience the evil that swarms all over the screen in ""Malicifant."" Even comedies with broad humor signal a hollowness, a vacuum, an absurdity to the world the existentialists saw and predicted we would all finally live in sooner or later.

Meryl Streep is magnificent in this..the mother without a moral compass to guide her children or herself. Julia Roberts in her best film in years as her daughter, one of them, screaming for attention, understanding, even love. Romantic love is formed around an incestuous relationship, alcohol, cigarettes, tantrums, trauma are the things that motivate any kind of movement. and the result is absurdity.

What is the meaning of being in the world? Why these collective tragedies? What have we done, not done? What do we believe in really? Not with sentimentality and stupidity..what holds it all together, or held it together but does not any longer? This film dips its oar into this chaotic sea with great skill, and finally great art.

Buy it, absorb it and look outside the door and see what truth there is to it.",1403136000,3,2266,4.802564102564102

6138913,1,B00H7LJ2UO,"Possibly the worst movie I've seen in the last 10 years . . . is this what Hollywood really thinks of people living in ""fly-over"" country?  How rude is that?  The only thing that brought me to this movie was that Benedict Cumberbatch (from BBC's ""Sherlock"" and other really good productions) was in the cast.  Love the guy and his acting, but this was an error of his choosing to be associated with such a 'mistake' on film - tried to say that nicely. HOWEVER, the one GOOD spot was when Mr. Cumberbatch got to sing to his ""cousin"" (half-sister) a sweet love song.  That is the only reason this even rates a one star.  Also, is this the way Hollywood sees religious American families?  One minute saying 'grace' at a funeral dinner, the next yelling ""G--damn"" across the table, and the next brawling on the floor.  And the treatment of the Cheyenne character . . . comments of vegetarians . . . and so much more I'm sure I missed while fast forwarding through to get to the end only to find out it really didn't have one was nasty.  Was there anyone these people didn't try to offend?  Yicks, I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.  I can only hope that in the future the producers of ""Sherlock"" at the BBC will find a spot for Mr. Cumberbatch to become the world's first singing Sherlock and include a small ditty in their program for him to vocalize.

6138957,2,B00H7LJ2UO,"a middle age woman w/cancer unexpectedly loses her husband (he either accidently drowns or commits suicide) and the story is basically how the family reacts to his death: spoiler - not well. the mother's behavior is negatively impacted by her addiction to pain meds improperly prescribed by her doctors, and she says whatever comes into her head, with no filter. Meryl Streep is a master at humanizing cruel characters and she continues that tradition where we learn that her mother was abusive and her husband cheated on her with her own sister and they had a child. kinda soap opera-ish. Her daughters resemble her in various ways, with aspects of her cruelty and/or coldness. I mean who has a physical skirmish with their mother at their father's funeral dinner, no matter how poorly the mother is behaving. instead of physically tackling your mother, why not leave the house to cool down. not as dramatic, but more believable. secrets come out and the family separates post-funeral with seemingly no intention of seeing one another again. this is a family who loves to fight even though they do sort of care about one another, or perhaps it is the husband's/father's death that is the catalyst, but alot of information could've remained unspoken, as far as I was concerned. acting is top notch and I can understand why actors would be drawn to this material about the darker side of human nature/behavior, but not an engaging story for the audience and no one to root for. everybody is almost believable, but just a tiny bit over the top - not the acting, but the behavior - as if characters have kept stuff so bottled up inside that the death uncorked everyone. But that's the thing, not everyone in a family has some deep dark secret. The story is abit too concentrated, abit too play like in that every character has their shtick and all of them together is too much; about a third of the featured characters abuse drugs or alcohol and said abuse is a featured part of the story: the lead, the suicide, the seducer and his victim. I thought the actor playing Little Charles was too old for the part, not age wise, but his screen persona is too mature to play Chris Cooper's son though he's a fine actor. The film also contains a fair amount of cursing, which I didn't like. dislike when a female character calls another female character b*tch, and especially when the other character is her mother - to me, it's just unnecessary. For comparison, the dead father in this story cheats on his wife with her sister and produces a child but no character calls him so much as an a*hole. 2 and 1/2 stars.",1402444800,,2604,4.650759219088937

I contemplated turning it off in the middle but I was hoping there would be some redeeming quality towards the end, no such luck.  119 minutes of my life I could have been better spent cleaning the bathroom or having a colonoscopy.",1402272000,,821,4.780141843971631
6138969,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"If you are looking for outstanding performances from well-known stars - this is your movie. If you are looking for light-hearted entertainment - stand clear. This is the story of an emotional & verbally abusive family that demonstrates how the process of abuse follows throughout generations affecting each family member's personality in different but still fatal ways. Even running away from the abusiveness does not alleviate the internal struggles of abused children who find themselves without the mechanics to foster good, healthy interpersonal relationships with mates or children. To those reared in this type of degenerative dysfunction, the scenes will not startle you but serve as a reminder. For those blessed to have been raised in a ""more"" functional family, this movie serves as a stark reminder of the pains people bring forth in their lives and the most serious difficulty of breaking free of its burden.",1402272000,,920,5.26530612244898

When a family member dies, everyone gathers to pay their respects. They end up paying their disrespects.

What did I think?

Its hard to know where to look with this many powerhouse performances competing for attention. Theres Meryl Streep as the manipulative matriarch dropping acid-tongued truth bombs; Juliette Lewis as the eternally upbeat self-deluding youngest daughter; Julia Roberts as the bitter first child so used to coping with family abuse that its hardened her to the ones she cares about most. But is it too much? This adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize-winning play has so much melodrama it almost requires a theatrical setting to work. The delicious, explosive dialogue needs to seep into the stalls to diffuse the emotional build-up, or the pressure cooker is in danger of exploding with too much force. If you like the sort of epically corrosive family dysfunction seen in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf, then this film is a show-stopper.

Sorrowfully, Osage County wasn't even nominated for the Academy Awards best picture, although Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts were nominated for their fine work.  I was enthralled with every moment of this film.  It is ensemble acting at its best, every role integrally a part of its power.  The story is of a rural Oklahoma family who have gathered at the death of Violets husband.  Her three daughters and her sister and their families reveal the various dysfunctions and secrets of the clan as their day together progresses.  I was born in Oklahoma, and both my parents were born and bred there.  Even though I grew up in Texas from age 3 and learned the Texas style of niceness, I strongly identify with the qualities of Okies in this film  a kind of tough ability to survive and a teasing of those taking themselves too seriously - both of which sometimes manifest as harsh meanness.  I also recall learning that women are to look good and a mothers job is to see that her daughters keep themselves youthfully attractive.

Meryl Streep, as always, became her character - a seriously dysfunctional woman in mid-life who rode roughshod over everyone in her family.  However, I think Meryl may have over-played her role a bit and overshadowed other performances, such as Julia Roberts as her daughter.  All her children came to her home as their father was supposedly missing and the mother contacted them all in ""desperation"".  No one really wanted to be there and it showed.  Even after the funeral, it was combative.  Unfortunately, the movie failed to deliver a satisfying conclusion as at the end, nothing was really resolved.  No one grew.  No relationships were restored.  They all just went their separate ways and we are left with a mother who is exactly as she was at the opening of the movie.

Meryl Streep was given a thoroughly unlikable character to work with and failed to find an ounce of humanity in the character that would have redeemed her.  Julia Roberts, ditto.  Benedict Cumberbatch and the actress who played his love interest were the only two who seemed to grasp who their characters were meant to be and save the rest of the casting doldrums.  Too bad.

I enjoy quirky and dysfunctional family drama with an element of humor.  Which, from the trailer, is what I was expecting here.  It actually wound up being a group of flat (yet loud and obnoxious) characters with ""secrets"" that weren't so terribly interesting.  None of them experienced a shred of development over the course of two hours.  It culminates in an abrupt end that eludes to this family going through exactly the same process at the next group event.

6139080,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"Some years ago I myself played the role of Beverly Weston in a local community theatre production of AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY.  I mention this because I expected my knowledge of the playscript would inform my opinion of the film version when I finally got around to seeing it.  And it did.

Both as a play and a film, AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY is the story of a dysfunctional family's implosion.  Noted poet and alcoholic Beverly Weston (Sam Shephard) begins the film by hiring household help in the form of Johnna (Misty Upham)--and then promptly commits suicide.  When his family gathers, they undergo a series of violent implosions that ultimately wrenches every relationship apart.  Most of the story centers on Beverly's wife, Violet (Meryl Streep), a drug addict battling oral cancer while alternately clinging to and pushing away her three daughters (Julia Roberts, Juliette Lewis, and Julianne Nicholson.)  The play is what you might call crowded with both characters and incident.  The film version runs two hours--about an hour less than the play--but it does its damndest to keep all the play's plotlines, and the result is not so much crowded as over-crowded.  The cuts in the script also have the effect of tearing away most of the play's dark humor and virtually all of its literary resonance, and too much is crammed into the last thirty minutes for it to be credible.

If the film stumbles due to the way in which it is constructed, it floats magnificently in terms of production.  So much has been said about Meryl Streep's abilities that I need hardly mention them; I will say that the dynamics of her performance, the way she shifts in mood and tempo and tone, is astonishing.  Julia Roberts' prettiness tends to work against her in this film, but she too is very good, and indeed the overall cast is very, very memorable.  The cinematography and art direction are also very striking.  The DVD includes a number of bonuses, most particularly an audio commentary track and a ""making of"" documentary.  The bitterness of the play and the harshness of the characters will not appeal to everyone, not by a long shot, but I recommend it nonetheless.

6139090,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"In a nutshell, August: Osage County is about a dysfunctional family reunion in their remote Oklahoma home. The family members (and their spouses, child and lover) reluctantly show up, all knowing that this is going to be a very uncomfortable stay, especially when their whimsical Violet (Meryl Streep), suffering from cancer, is addicted to narcotics.

As it turns out, it is a very uncomfortable stay for everyone in the film, and audiences, too. And the real problem is, the conventional story  based on a Tracy Letts play, adapted by the playwright himself  is supposed to be darkly comedic, while the film itself is dark but not very funny. There are also dark secrets to be exposed, but the revelations are not very shocking.

August: Osage County is a very good example of too much acting and too little direction. It seems director John Wells strives to be respectful of source material and those great players  including unstoppable Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts  when he should step in and show his vision. In fact, he does, when the familys patriarch (Sam Shepard) appears in the earlier part, but not enough.

Characters don't have to be likable (and here they are not), but at least should provide some reason for us to care, which the director fails to do. After all, what is the point of watching them?",1400803200,2,1317,4.800884955752212

I found the steady stream of F-bombs and vulgarity was unnecessary and off putting.

The best part of the movie was when, FINALLY Chris Cooper's character takes a stand against the family's favorite pastime of ripping each other to shreds.

6139095,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"While the subject was somewhat raw and aggressive with a family over-run with dysfunction, the storyline made the path that was taken to get there very visible and heartbreaking. It was a painful display of how children don't/won't/can't really relate to the lives their parents had to create the people they become. Growing up in an abusive (emotional or otherwise) environment doesn't get fixed or changed when young adults marry away into their independence and have children before they have worked through their issues. Instead children become a distraction and deterrent from healing, and children don't care about anything more than how their parents nurtured, mentored and guided them into their own independence. The daughters had a really huge moment with their mother outside while she described her own mother's abuse and they just walked away. I was enamored by the message that came out of this movie, and surprised at how the critics couldn't get past the surface of cruelty from the matriarchs.",1400716800,,1010,5.164634146341464

6139097,2,B00H7LJ2UO,"One of the best things to come out of movies is when you watch one that involves family problems. The reason it's great is that suddenly all of the problems you might have with your own family seem inconsequential compared to those of the characters onscreen. The downside of this is that you find yourself sitting there watching people with tremendous character issues for 2 hours which in itself can be a bit daunting.

AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY is about the Weston family. It opens with patriarch Beverly Weston (Sam Shepherd) interviewing a possible live in nurse to take care of his wife Violet (Meryl Streep). Violet is prone to throwing tantrums and taking more meds than she needs when it comes to her cancer of the mouth problem. Beverly then does what most of us would consider after having to be involved with this family: he commits suicide. This brings back the entire family for the funeral.

First off is Violet's sister and her husband, Mattie Fae Aiken (Margo Martindale) and Charlie (Chris Cooper). Mattie is one of those smiling faces and larger than life persons that capture a room but always have a hidden sadness deep inside. Charlie is the friendliest person in the film, always having a good word to say but not quite sure how he fits into this group. Also on hand is daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), the one daughter who stayed near home to help but who hides a secret that you won't see coming near the end.

Coming home for the funeral is Barbara (Julia Roberts), her father's favorite but a strong willed woman much like her mother. Barbara left the confines of this family but has problems of her own at present with her husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) having an affair which has led to their separation. Along with them is their daughter, Jean (Abigail Breslin), your stereotypical troubled teen who finds fault in both her parents.

Next to arrive home is Karen (Juliette Lewis), the free spirit of the three sisters. Karen has her own faults, moving from man to man in the hopes of finding happiness and yet always picking the worst males possible. Her latest is Steve (Dermot Mulrooney), a sports car driving pot smoking wheeler dealer. If you don't see where his character is heading early on then you're not paying attention. It is so over handed that to say its obvious is in itself obvious.

The last member to arrive is cousin Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch), son of Charlie and Mattie Fae. Little Charles is incredibly shy and withdrawn but having lived his life around this family would have do that to you. Constantly put down by his mother, loved by his father, Little Charles also finds himself in a bit of a fix before the end of the film.

With the stage set we experience what is happening in this household as each member arrives and eventually they return from the funeral for the family dinner. Violet is the most vicious of mothers seen on screen in some time. She cajoles and pokes at the wounds in each of her family members, provoking them all in hopes of their returning her attacks. When they do the most explosive moments of the film show themselves. Each one edges us closer and closer to the moment when some will strike back, some will reveal themselves to be more than anyone expected, some will realize they are more like Violet than they had hopes and all secrets will be revealed.

Based on the stage play this movie unfold like one with little time spent moving from location to location. Instead most of the film plays out in the Weston home where bitter and damaging history has played out in the past leaving everyone with scars they carry with them for life. The home itself is a character, displaying the time worn walls that hold secrets of a family that offered little love and much damage to one another. The film only offers three sympathetic characters from start to finish: Charles, Little Charles and Johnna, the nurse Beverly hired. The rest are all people you might recognize as the family members you most try to avoid at reunions.

Roberts and Streep were both nominated for best actress this past year but I don't think either should have qualified. It's another case of those who seem the most flawed and loud get the attention while understated performances are ignored. Had either shown a character here that you had some sympathy for at some point it might have been different. As offered neither grows or changes, instead simply retaining their dislikable selves.

If your idea of entertainment is listening to actresses yell at one another, tossing out the GD expletive as if it were water and seeing a family self destruct before your eyes then you'll want to watch this one non-stop. If that's not your cup of tea then avoid it. Maybe you might want to watch it once to feel good about your own family but my guess is it will be tedious at best for everyone else except those trendy people who find depth in destruction of the family.",1400630400,,4924,4.657077100115075

I loved it.

I think every woman on Earth should take away a positive and affirmative message from it that they can make their own way and break the cycles of addiction, abuse and lies.  Although I didn't have to suffer in these same ways, I can relate to the struggle in similar, family strife.

They continually show up for more ""fun and games"" with this head case mother who manipulates and abuses them all- because it's Mama.

The movie trailers promote this movie very differently than what the movie is actually about. This was a free movie rental for me and it was a waste of a free movie credit. Too Dark, cruel family etc etc. Can't say too much without dropping spoilers.

Lets put it this way, I rented two movies 12 years as a Slave and this movie, I was PISSSED after seeing this movie and highly appreciated the acting and the story line much better in 12 years as a slave.

Some day I hope she talks about it and tells us if she actually knew someone like this woman though I doubt that she would know anyone like that. Beverly (Julia's) father and Vi Julia's (mother) were a mess but their parent's were worse so that explains how they got the way they are. A big surprise towards the end of the movie. I loved this movie.
Fix some popcorn, a drink and get comfortable. Tell dad to take the kids out somewhere because you won't want to miss  a moment or a word of dialogue in this movie. In  the last scene be sure to read the road sign so you understand the ending.
After seeing this movie you will understand the reason some people do not go home for the holidays, weddings or funerals for that matter. Some people actually do have a mother like Vi, believe it or not. Personally I would not go home for Vi's funeral, who needs the insanity of a mother like this?

There was a time when mid-budget character driven dramas (Terms of Endearment, Dead Man Walking, Adaptation, Misery, American Beauty, In the Bedroom) were praised by critics and gained an audience. Not everyone wants mindless entertainment at the theater. Meryl Streep is a gift actress and proves it yet again. Julia Roberts holds her own against the legendary Streep and delivers the second best performances of her career (after Pretty Woman) in August Osage County. This film is proof that Academy Members vote without watching the all the nominees, if they had Julia Roberts would have Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars in March. Before anyone gets upset Lupita was fine and happy for her that she won. But, she didn't she carry an entire film like Roberts does in August Osage County.",1400284800,3,946,4.91875

The characters were ugly, dishonest, immoral, spiteful, hateful, mean, uncooth, illiterate, vindictive wretches who destroyed their own lives and everyone who came into contact with them. I suppose that was a glimpse of what Hollywood believes midwesterners actually are. Not one single character sought or achieved redemption or even moderation of their failures in life. They embraced them and doubled down; alienating what little there was left in their miserable existance. In the end you were left with the dissolution of them all, and each parting to find new, unaware people to entrap in  their chaotic failures. What was the purpose of all that?",1400284800,,765,5.12

I was a little unprepared for all the seething undercurrents as I was unfamiliar with the work, however,  while it was not what I expected it certainly surpassed what I thought I would be watching. There were so many moments in the film that felt genuine, little bits of conversations that struck a chord as being true,I have a perfect example but then I would spoil an important plot element using it in this review. Be warned, this is not a comedy, while there are some lighter moments, overall it is a tale of addiction, co-dependence, and family dysfunction that kept surprising me by inserting tender moments here and there.

If you want to see a movie about a screwed up family they could make a movie about mine and call it ""August: Pawnee County"". Which is right next door to Osage.

The writing is very good, the acting is excellent, the cast is great, and the film had a nicely dark tone.  However, after a while, I found myself more and more depressed by the likes of this very dysfunctional family.  Letts' other works can also be said to involve family dysfunction.  However, they are presented more as dark comedies.  August is more true to life and, therefore, a pretty heavy downer when it comes to its major themes.  Like I said, the movie isn't bad.  It's actually good.  This review is based on my own personal tastes.  I appreciate good writing and acting, but, like I said, the movie left me feeling like I'm living in a pretty bleak and hopeless world (at least when it comes to intimate human relationships).

6139177,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"There are broken families of broken people. Not all mothers are nurturing and/or selfless heroic crusaders for their children. Not all families are composed of people who want to come together. This film attempts to tell a story about the forced reunion of one such family. But, off timing, unbalanced cadence and heavy handed performances mar the attempt. I would even guess that these great actors were cast for their individual talents but not their cohesiveness or chemistry. The performances are good but they are heavy handed ""PERFORMANCES"" so characters feel inauthentic, disparate, some feel unnecessary and the movie feels inauthentic and unbalanced. Although the film is described as being comedic, the heavy performances and the off beat cadence of the film create few if any laughs. I can see the script is rife with acerbic wit and comedy from awkward and uncomfortable surprise. Comedy comes from chemistry and/or timing and that is missing in this movie. I know these people exist, this family could exist, and there are funny and compelling stories from them. The film's effort to deliver us that ends up a contrivance. Good stage plays made into film seem to often fail in connecting with an audience as film. This one is no exception. Up tick to three stars for good individual performances and the potential in the story. Down tick to three stars for disjointed characters, inauthentic portrayals and unbalanced storytelling.",1400025600,,1444,5.122881355932203

I really understood a lot of this and the hardships you go through watching your parents go farther and farther down the dark rabbit hole.  Still it was amazing to watch the character development and the different interacting relationships, to see aspects of yourself and others (if you have any experience of these things yourself).  This certainly is not a movie to watch for a buoyant afternoon of glee, but it is an astounding drama that really showcases the talents of Meryl Streep and especially Julia Roberts.

The realities may different in the particular details in your family and mine, but this film disproves the Hallmark card family once and for all. Good riddance.  Although painful to watch at times, humor often breaks through and makes this plot bearable and human.  There are unexpected twists and turns, there are revelations hidden for years, there are signs of committed, compassionate love, and there is chaos.  If none of this sounds familiar, you're either in denial or don't live with other human beings.  The star-studded cast led by Meryl Streep is alive and passionate. No one drops the ball and we are carried through to the end, where redemption is glimpsed if truth is obeyed.",1399852800,,828,4.7622377622377625

There was too much drama and not enough connection with the characters.  It was hard to connect with any of them, I did like Juliette Lewis's character, she was the most believable.

Brits have a hard time faking Texas and Oklahoma accents, but also Cumberbatch was so wrongly cast that it was embarrassing.

Meryl Streep was fabulous as usual with her ability to lose herself into her character and show all the imperfections and damage. Julianne Nicholson is a delight, and she nailed her part. This is the actor who deserved an Oscar nomination. Check our her role there as opposed to the doctor on Masters of Sex, and you will get what I mean. I have been watching her career for many years and she has a lot of range and is really under appreciated. I don't understand how Julia Roberts could possibly get an Oscar nomination for this. I guess Hollywood popularity is more important than talent. She plays two roles in all her movies. The smiley, vulnerable endearing ""pretty woman"" and the self-absorbed, manipulative ""w! tch"". She has no range outside of that and in both cases it seems she plays herself because she acts the same way in her real life in interviews, etc. There are a thousand actors who could have done better. It seemed like she was just saying her lines (or shouting them), but you didn't get a sense of who the character was and what she was really thinking and feeling. I think Julia had possibilities earlier in her career, when she took more risks like Mary Reily. Now she just seems to go through the motions and not really care about bringing authenticity to her characters. Benedict Cumberbatch really nailed his role too. Complete opposite of his Sherlock role. For individual performances, I would have given the movie a higher rating based on at least 3 excellent performances.

Tess Weston has to be disappointed about the take off from her Novel using her three Weston sisters.  Is it possible she will sue the industry for infringing on her story?  Only Tess wrote her Novel with more class.  I am sure she will not like this take off from her Novel.  I am sure she has a copyright. huh",1399334400,,531,4.147058823529412

I know it's a dark depiction of a life affected by drinking and drug addiction.. but it wasn't what I was expecting.

6139276,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"Reminds me of a play in hi-school you are told to watch about human misery; it will be good for you.  Violet is no ""Shrinking Violet"".  Her motto might be:  "" Do unto others as you were done unto,""  though, she is barely conscious of it.  She implies to her kids they had it good; she grew up in poor times.  Violet is at the top of the food chain, though Barb sees her as a bottom-feeder.  She is a pill-popping, outspoken matriarch, delighting in pointing out others' flaws and revealing secrets.  We get an inkling of why she is the way she is when she relates a story about her own mother's cruelty toward her, who tramples on her budding and tender feelings. All know you reap what you sow, and Violet passes parts of her  misery to the next generation.  None of her daughters have a decent record of relationships, and they are not happy for the most part.  The family is a mixture of sensitivities; either they will be crushed by experiences or survive. Some will win and some will lose.  Violet is strong in her own way, though she has so alienated those around her it will take an outsider to help her endure.  I think the lesson here might be:  when someone is so selfish and self-absorbed you have an obligation to look out for yourself first.  Class closed.",1399161600,,1269,4.363247863247863

I recommend the amazon instant upload because you will never want to watch it again although being able to see these fine actors is nice.  The acting is great. They delivered as directed.  To me it was like they said hey, I loved the setting of The Bridges of Madison County let's go do something there.  Oh, OK but I don't want to put any makeup on during the shoot. Let's just all get up not even get dressed and shoot this movie.  I wasn't 29 minutes into it and it lost my attention.  I started using my computer and reviewing Amazon purchases, leaving feedback. In the background it sounded like a behind the scenes documentary of the real life of people who appear on Jerry Springer. Foul language , yelling, screaming and a lot of guessing who was unfaithful and surprises of who did what.  Otherwise beautiful women looking like crap and acting like low class citizens.  Great job looking ugly Meryl and Julia!  You nailed it.  Being in flannel PJs most of the movie with no makeup on sure must have been an easy shoot!  What a waste buying this on Blue ray.  You have to watch it to say you did if your a fan of the actors. But do yourself a favor and watch it on Prime or Digital download. I'm going to feel bad even loaning  this one out!

6139294,2,B00H7LJ2UO,"Movies based on plays have two things in common: they are long on dialogue, short on action; and they usually are not very good.  Osage is no exception.  The occasional glimpse of a field or a highway is to remind us that this play is now a movie.  Meryl Streep plays an angry, pill-addicted, hostile old woman who enjoys alienating her whole family by belittling them and humiliating them when they all gather to mourn their patriarch, who presumably killed himself because he could no longer stand his hurtful spouse.  At the funeral dinner table the mother faces them all off.  No doubt it takes acting skills, with which Streep and Julia Roberts and the whole cast are blessed, to portray the tortured and unhappy members of this dysfunctional family.  However in the end, when the mother is left alone, probably crying to herself, ""Now why did all those horrible people abandon a kindly, loving person like me?"" we are unmoved, saying ""So what?""  The movie is somewhat sterile; it doesn't evoke much if any of our sympathy.  The Native American housekeeper, who doesn't say much during the film, shows her maternal protective instincts in one scene: Wham!  And if the Good Lord above is ever susceptible to boredom, surely He succumbs when Uncle Charlie bumbles through a long and exceptionally inarticulate Grace.

6139301,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"Meryl Streep was incredible in this movie, playing an aging drug addict. Julia Roberts is also amazing in this movie.  All of the performances were remarkable.  I watched it twice because the characters were so fascinating to watch.  It is dark, not a feel-good movie. It delves into evil and abuse and how it is passed down through the generations and how it impacts this family.  It also touches on how the different family members both get caught up in the evil and some manage to confront and break away from the pattern of evil and meanness.
I loved the theme, I think this level of meanness exists in many families and is not talked about, and I like how this movie confronted it head-on.
But mostly it was the performances that kept me fascinated with this movie.
The only thing that drove me nuts was the fact that, even though the scene was set in sweltering Oklahoma in August, and the characters frequently complained and commented about the heat, they all wore long sleeved shirts over tshirts and pants and/or robes and pajamas!  There's one scene where Barbara (Julia Roberts) is wearing a long heavy sleeveless black dress with a black sweater over it and she leans over a fan and opens her sweater to cool off.  How about take off the dang sweater! Julie Roberts (Barb) especially seems to complain the most about the heat, yet her character wears long sleeve shirts over tshirts and never takes the long sleeve shirts off.  I wish I knew the story behind why that is, it's so obvious and it's odd that the director and actors didn't think that it would be noticeable?  Or maybe it was on purpose to create some kind of atmosphere or symbolism?
Anyway it's a terrific movie and I will probably watch it again.",1398902400,3,1725,4.577922077922078

The actors are amazing, Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts give stand out performances.and the other actors followed in their footsteps.

You're never sure how everything gets resolved. However, it provides for a lot of conjecture by the viewers as to how resolution will, if ever, be reached. The performances were well executed and believable. The screenplay had to be difficult to write from a structure perspective as well as emotionally.

6139315,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"This is a movie that is just filled with heavyweights in the acting field.  Not least of all Meryl Streep (IMO the greatest female actor alive today) who just has layers and layers and layers of ability.  But everyone else played their roles to a ""T"" as well.

A powerful story about a family in Oklahoma getting together due to the death of the patriarch played by Sam Sheppard.  It has all the characters of a typical family - the drug addict (although this time played by the matriarch  Meryl Streep), the daughter who resents her mother, yet displays the same traits, the daughter who stays close to home to look after her parents and resents it, the daughter who is a mess and a ditz that has made bad choices all her life just to get as far away from the family as possible, etc, etc.

All played masterfully.  It is a tragic story ultimately and shows what keeps family members at arms length from each other.  A very real story if not typical in so many ways (There's no such thing as a ""functional"" family).

My only two criticisms is 1.  I thought Ewan McGregor's character over-reacted when Julia Robert's character DESERVEDLY slapped her daughter across the face for being a nasty, clueless, back-talking brat (the other ""b"" word would be more appropriate but the censors don't allow) especially considering what had just transpired in the story.  Is this where we have gotten in our country?  Slapping a child across the face when it is completely deserved, warrants a reaction as if you gave them a close-fisted upper cut that laid them out??  It's not child abuse in any way, shape, or form (a slap), regardless what armies of wisdom-less child development psychologists say.  Do it once or twice in a lifetime and you will make such a strong statement to your child that will net positive results in the future as an adult.

2.  Didn't quite get the ""satisfaction"" of Julia Robert's character as she kept driving away at the end of the movie.  Was it because she felt free?  Free from what?  Her mother?  She stayed away from her all her adult life.  Her separated husband?  already free from him as well.  Her daughter?  That would prove a pretty horrible mother wanting to be separated from her 14 yr old daughter.  So, I was never clear on that.  Perhaps I missed something.

So if you want a good drama performed to perfection by all players, I would highly recommend August: Osage County.",1398816000,4,2409,4.593896713615023

It does nothing but flesh out the negative in life and bring it right into your living room. Filled with line after line of vitriol and hatred it does nothing to uplift the viewer or even attempt to have a redemptive resolution.

After it was over we tried to figure out the message and someone came up with 'Don't depend on your family when you're old--you'd better have some paid help around at the end' which I thought was apropos.  No one in my family liked the movie much, in fact my husband said it gave him nightmares of shouting women.

At times it paused itself every 10 seconds, it finally ran the movie uninterrupted for about a half hour then the pausing started up again.

Some of the most memorable moments came from Meryl Streep (no words can describe her performance) and Chris Cooper (his character's defense of his son will make you want to cry and cheer).

Those around her are quite good, and our little Julia has grown up and is becoming a fine actor; no doubt working with the Queen kept her on her toes. The plot is heavy and gets heavier as the minutes pass.  There's nothing shiny about this film as the cover shows.  It's a brutal look at a dysfunctional family that covers everything including incest, suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, divorce, infidelity, child abuse....

This results in depth and more realistic character development (as well as somewhat likeable, somewhat understandable characters). Shakespeare knew how; the writer that penned this pap did not.

6139387,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"The acting was incredible, but the ""f-bomb"" was entirely over-used.  Even among some of the most dysfunctional individuals and families in real life, the f-bomb is not necessarily used this much, or not at all.

The frequency of its use in the script gives the impression that to be really successful in the film industry, a successful portrayal via base verbal drama is mandatory by using this exaggerated, over-worked verbal format; that a dysfunctional and/or unhealthy family unit simply MUST be portrayed as using rough and heavily repeated f-bomb language  this limited thinking, limited vision in writing, yields limited, mediocre art.

Likewise, it begins to give the impression the writer believes the story will not stick in our minds, or that the audience will not 'stick it out' in viewing, if the writer doesn't, essentially, rely on this extensive language 'drama'...to keep us watching?  NOT.

Some of the shrewdest, most manipulative, intellectually cunning, flat-out dysfunctional family members, co-workers, neighbors, etc., we all encounter in real life, whether or not under the influence of any one or number of substances, can and often do inflict their pain and chaos without one drop of foul language; i.e., you don't realize you've been intellectually and emotionally 'hit' until their smooth-talking words are out, until a slick deed is done.

Via stage or screen, this level of 'dysfunctional sophistication' requires and, in fact, deserves the use of a far greater, more refined work in portrayal of personalities, motive, of what is happening in the heads of the characters being portrayed.  These actors are phenomenal, as they perform here before the more restrictive confines of the camera lens (versus the difference in stage); yet the actors could and should have been far better tapped to better utilize their already proved, captivating talents and acting capabilities.

In contrast, it would be refreshing to see this same level of 'intellectual, emotional, and social dysfunction' portrayed in this same family without the constant eye-rolling-drama CRUTCH of 'cheap-shock' language usage every other sentence.  It's no secret it takes real talent and professional experience to both write and perform, to portray family constellations, relationships, and complex human interaction.  Most of us have observed, heard, or perhaps been a part of such family scenes, yet this continual base language is an exaggeration, when used by all or key roles with every breath -- the viewing public knows this.

Much of the movie did accomplish the greater reliance on just good acting via the great talents of a fantastic cast; however, the acting talent is better portrayed and appreciated among the supporting cast, in the secondary family member roles, where 'cheap-shock' f-bomb usage and language seemed much less.  The main actors were, as always, tops in their usual work.  But, sadly, their professional abilities become quickly OVERSHADOWED with the writing crutch of constant 'cheap-shock' language overuse.

This is easily a five star production.  Yet, for what seems to be lazy 'word-work' by the play write in his original stage play (a well-known, authentic, phenomenal hit), and in his transferring it here to a movie script, it is necessarily reduced to a four-star rating.

Some language is fine, realistic, expected, but this much is a disappointing, elementary reliance on unrealistic, shallow drama.  If you find that a writer persists in 'painting the walls with it', it then diminishes the fine acting skills of top professional performers, instead of further magnifying and challenging the actors' fine-tuned skills, which we've come to crave and appreciate.  When a writer needs to add coat after coat of the crap, it is an insult to you, the viewer, which suggests you can't think for yourself and not lose interest in his work without painting his script with layers of tiresome, empty language drama.

The best writing will challenge the best actors to develop in their work, to stretch, to effectually reveal their character in a challenging new role.  Perhaps some contemporary viewers are content to pay good money to passively watch their personal life experience acted out on stage/screen; or perhaps the curious and naive are content to come away thinking, in error, that this is how it is, this is how it's 'done'.  And, perhaps this is a reflection of what seems a growing inability, or disinterest, in a higher level of 'audience thought participation', a dumbing-down of sorts; a possible reflection of a growing inability or disinterest in a higher level of entertainment skills; skills that would provide performance at a level of sophistication that could more effectually portray the realistic, even dangerous levels that authentic dysfunction can take on.

Bottom line, despite great acting, great set, all the top work that went into production, plus a bit of comedic work subtly woven through various scenes, the film doesn't respect the audience OR the actors at a higher, more sophisticated level above this film's base writing  this production, utilizing top talent, simply reduces, rather than amplifies, both the viable story and the actors portrayal of their characters.  What a shame to see these great, talented actors reduced to mere verbal drama, flooded with lower-level script language, so beneath their capabilities; in contrast to allowing them to brilliantly act out their characters' colorful, spicy, crazy personalities, foibles, denials, and life-failings  take away the language and you are forced, like a gifted mime, to stretch, to produce quality quality ART!

Would love to see other insightful, life-experienced, creative writers rework this story/theme for a deeper, richer, more powerful viewer experience, well beyond the shallows of 'cheap-shock' writing -- both audience and cast deserve better.",1398384000,5,5894,5.336933045356371

Included in the search are the three adult daughters of Bev and Violet. Without trying to ruin it, I will say that Bev never returns and the family has to deal with the very difficult, cantankerous Violet. She is one mean woman, a bully really, and as the story unfolds, the viewer gets a glimpse as to why she is the way she is. Julia Roberts plays the eldest daughter, Barbara, who comes out from the West with her husband and daughter. There is trouble in her relationships as well and we begin to see parallels between Violet and Barbara surface even though Barbara appears to detest Violet.

The acting is strong and excellent, and the story is intriguing, as layers of the family are unpeeled to explain Bev's decision to leave. I can see how August: Osage County would make for a great play. But as a film, it leaves something to be desired. So much more of a story can be told on film than on stage but, being what I'm guessing is a pretty literal adaptation, the movie is limited to basically one single setting, the home of Bev and Violet, and one single week in the characters' lives. The dark, stiflingly hot house is a metaphor, however, and it's understandable that we don't get more of a before-and-after view of the characters except through their own words.

It's worth a watch to see some very good performances. But I've never disliked Meryl Streep more. Her character is pretty despicable, making her hard to stomach, even for a viewer sitting on a couch a thousand miles away from Osage County.

People do things like shoot a bunch of people in a public place when they stop taking psych drugs cold turkey.  Finally, if it is August in Osage County, why is everyone dressed in warm clothing?  One scene shows a thermometer reading of 108 degrees, yet Julia Roberts is shown in flannel pajamas with a flannel bathrobe over them.  All through the movie the characters are wearing heavy clothing in a house that has no air conditioning.  This movie misses the mark on many levels.  Not recommended.",1398038400,3,915,4.484848484848484

I guess I was hoping for a drama with some dark humor.  But it was really just a dark drama.  All of the main characters were unlikeable and didn't really seem to grow.

It was hard to watch, and never wound up delivering a worthwhile reason to have watched it.  (As opposed to a movie that may be hard to watch, but still very important and worthwhile...like ""Schindler's List."")  After watching the movie, I watched one of the DVD's special features in which some of the makers of the movie discussed, in front of a live audiance, the making of ""August: Osage County.""  It was clear that these movie makers really, genuinely believed that this movie was a true and accurate depiction of virtually ""every real family""...they repeatedly said so.  I'm happy to say I have never met any people as dysfunctional and unlikable as the characters in this movie.  And, while I'm sure there are some who exist out there, there is absolutely nothing about the story in this movie that makes it a story worth telling.  The people who made this movie obviously must have pathetically disgusting families...because they repeatedly said this movie was ""just like their own family gatherings.""

I can't remember a more vile character than Vi (played by Meryl Streep), nor a more lost and vulnerable character than Barbara, played by Julia Roberts. Each actor in the ensemble seems perfectly cast for his/her role. The family of 3 daughters comes together to support their cancer-stricken, drug addicted mother after the suicide of their father. As families always do, they bring up old hurts and unmet needs, and each knows exactly how to inflict the maximum pain on each other. However in ""Osage County"" the art of speaking one's mind, liberally laced with profanity, is elevated to a new level that is uncomfortable to witness. The caring and loving remarks were so infrequent, that I couldn't even imagine why they bothered to get together at all.

The dinner scene, which apparently required 18 takes, is the core of the plot, where all characters are together at once. This is where the family dynamics really play out, and allows each actor to display their acting chops. The ending seemed so incomplete and abrupt that I'm still wondering ""what happened next""?  I guess that's a screen writer's way of making sure that the film stays with you.

The special features on the DVD included an interview with the director who said that many people had told him that their families were just like this one. All families are dysfunctional in some manner, but this one wins the prize !",1398038400,3,1483,4.78515625

As for the plot, I could have just spent some time with my own family and gotten as much out of it as this movie.  Granted my family doesn't yell obscenities at each other, but the language in the movie wasn't my issue with it.  I guess I was just expecting someone to redeem themselves or learn something, but this was just about an awful family with no hope.  I already know what it's like to live in an emotionally abusive environment, and it doesn't even require anyone to be addicted to drugs or alcohol, trust me.  I think when you have talented actors in a movie that doesn't play well, it's often because of the writing and direction.  Average actors can make great movies with the right director/script, and great actors can make a lousy movie with the wrong director/script.

6139456,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"Good story of exceptionally unhappy people who like many families in America never should have ever been born in the same family. There just isn't any chemistry or connection. But with Streep and Roberts together, , I had expected it to go even more over the top.  They way they made streep to look like a junkie who hasn't been outside in 10 yrs was excellent. Even tho there is  sort of a story in it this film is more about how  a group of peole called family can learn to stand being around each other for an entire weekend or few days. Sadly...it probab;y represents 1/3 of American families, only we don't get paid by Hollywood.  Cudos for nobody getting beat up or any violence. Noce to see  a movie can be made without any today.

As a man, I would have to say that, if I watched this flick with a new guy I recently met at the office that I liked a lot, this movie could be the ""test"" to see if I could ever have any deep or uncomfortable conversations with him. If the guy didn't like the movie, or at least have a lot, I mean a lot... to say about it, then it would be a good indicator that he and I could never become close as friends. Because friends , even men, occasionally have to dig deep to the bone once in a while and if you get that old ""it aint nothing"" kinda attitude or ""Jeez, these people need to go out more often(which they do)"" kinda remarks...you are not talking to a very deep person. ......because like it or not, it is a very deep movie. Streep's drug addiction was made a najor part of the movie but in reality, this whole movie might not have been any differe nt WITHOUT the drugs. As Streep says...""Drugs don't talk, people do."" 3 stars for the entertainment value. 5 if your using it as a test to find out about how someone handles or would handle stress. (Maybe marriage advisers should use this as a litmus test)

I bet out of 100 men watching this, 50 would start getting antsy 1/2 the way thru, the other half something would come out of them from their own childhood and  a  golden remark would just fly out. Its not a mans movie to be sure...but its definitely npt one of those sappy womens cry at the end films either. In fact...... the end may be the saddest endimng ever made in the last decade....IF  you can get it.  I wouldnt mind marrying a woman who could talk to me for 10 minutes on this film. Yuh gotta have some back bone in your soul to not get uncomfortable or bored after its 1/2 over. The only thing I have no idea is why they put an American Indian care taker in the movie of which  without here there would be no noticable difference.  Even tho not a  womens movie, its a great film for a bunch of women from the office  who want to get to know each other better. This film will give you all something to talk about after its over...thats for sure.  We need a lot more movies like this and  a lot less Sopranos and Breaking Bad (and I like both) if our children are going to see what real life is like on screen. 50 yrs ago our mothers weren't allowed to see what went on behind closed doors. Now that weve allowed it, everyone wants to still see Al PACINO say ""Say hello to my little friend.""  I don't get it.

6139457,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"I watched this once, and the next day watched it again. I don't know when I last saw a movie that is so consistently well acted and well written. This is a dark family drama that deals with big themes: mortality, the definition of family,  and how abusive behavior can be passed down from generation to generation, to name the first three that come to mind.

I've never been a big Julia Roberts fan, but she amazed me in this role. There isn't one thing in her performance that felt inauthentic. But beyond the lead roles, the supporting cast (Juliette Lewis, Sam Shepherd, Margo Martindale and many others) is phenomenal. Like the play/movie ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""August: Osage County"" is an instant southern gothic classic.

I don't understand the number of negative reviews here. I read some of them and was disheartened. I don't consider myself a movie snob by any means -- I will watch just about anything that's entertaining. But it seems that there is a growing segment of movie-watchers who only want either soap bubble rom-coms or action movies.

This film falls into that very genre. Essentially, in the midst of a blazing summer when something happens to their father, three adult sisters and their loved ones converge on the family home in Oklahoma. What follows is two hours of ugliness that is actually kind of enjoyable (because it is not happening to the viewer).

Just visualize two foul-mouthed she-dragons at a big dinner table and you will get the idea; Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts as mom and daughter rip each other new ones, over and over. They are both wonderful. But it gets tense for the entire clan: old emotional wounds are scratched open, weaknesses are exposed, secrets are revealed, and failures are broadcast. There's even a physical altercation between daughter and mother.

Sam Shepard was wonderful in the beginning of the movie; I wanted to see more of him.

Overall this was fun stuff in a guilty pleasure way, but it felt a little too much like some uncomfortable holiday dinners I experienced myself as a kid. I think many people have a dragon (or two) in the family.",1397952000,7,1269,4.759090909090909

The sisters bring along the men in their lives and we see that there are problems a-plenty in this extended family. Based on the play by Tracy Letts, this film is a brutal look at the extent to which parental cruelty can destroy lives.

Ms. Streep once again works her cinematic magic in painting a disturbingly real human being whose horrible childhood has left lifelong scars. The superb supporting cast also includes Margo Martindale, Ewan McGregor, Chris Cooper, Dermot Mulroney, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Sam Shepard.

6139470,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"August Osage County takes a look at the lives of the Weston family, whose paths have diverged until a family crisis brings them back to the Oklahoma house they grew up in, and to the dysfunctional woman (Streep) who raised them.

Having grown up in a dysfunctional family (although not as bad as this one) like a lot of people, I could see parts of my relatives in several of the characters, which I think is the main point and smartness of the plot.  This movie gives you an insight into a family with such dysfunction at so many levels, I couldn't help but see some of those elements that exist in a lot of families.

Meryl Streep is one of the best actresses of her generation and again she proves that she can bring the best out of any character when just handed a script and told to go to it.  She does an excellent job at the role of the drugged out loud mouthed mom with a lot of skeletons in the closet.  You actually love to hate her but at the same time feel sorry for her as well.  Brilliantly acted on Streep's part.

Julie Roberts is also solid in her role as Barbara, one of the daughters, who like most in the family have their secrets as well.  Roberts and Streep's chemistry is obvious and both play off the other's characters very well.

The supporting cast is also a who's-who of well known good quality actors, which helps to lift this movie to better heights.  The movie does plod along like a slow moving train at times (but as my wife said, it is that type of movie), until it reaches its boiling point where all the dysfunction boils over.  Although the movie's ending was a bit unsatisfying at least to me.  But maybe that's the point though, to show that not everything can be fixed in 2 hours of story telling.

Overall, a decent movie to watch with an ok plot.  The outstanding acting from Streep and Roberts makes this movie much more than what it would have been with anyone else in the roles.  3.5 stars",1397865600,3,1934,4.303867403314917

Oh, did I mention that this is a family gathering? There are those who seem to feel that this is an accurate portrayal of family intensity, but I haven't seen such savage verbal fighting since I saw ""Virginia Wolf"".

6139527,1,B00H7LJ2UO,"The sad fact is, for entertainment I could have opened up my own family of horrors or yours. Somewhere back we all have them. I doubt I would have used such vulgar language to paint it, but they were BAGGAGED adults.
That said, even good acting could not make this movie memorable for anything except the cruelty that exists in so many families, the hushed silenced no one talks about. The sweet old grandfather who was less honorable than the family would take notice of,  and the mothers who really were pathetically tolerated. Then the Funeral that shines the light on the entire lot of family vomit.
Only one scene in there hit me in the gut, the rest of those people I knew too well to be shocked or to give one whit of sympathy. What a mess to mix up for the children coming in the future. Oh what wickedness in the heart of man and woman!
The one scene? When Meryl tells of the boots she wanted for Christmas, near the end of the movie....I won't spoil it...but I cried, not for her, for me and my brothers and every child out there, born with a mother so cruel and so vile. My mother would have done that just to rip my heart. That was the only part of this sick family movie I will know always. Meryl's  boots were me opening that box after all the wishes of what I wanted most in the entire world, and hearing my own mother laugh and mock and sign the papers upon her death...""Let it be known she did not ever give birth to five children."" Her last words in print in the presence of an Attorney and his witnesses...I imagine she laughed one last time before the ink dried on that paper and she took her last evil breath too.
I cried with Meryl, because the thorn pricked. Movies should touch or at least identify...I guess it did that at best.
If you want to see a wicked mess of a family or as me, identify with it...and get nauseated again, this is the one to do it. If you want to see great actors and actress' s sink to the bottom to feed...Here's the one movie to witness.
I did not love it...I wanted a great Novel type movie. That is not this mess for profit. Did not love or like.",1397606400,16,2098,4.1905940594059405

Julia Roberts in her best role ever. But it's the supporting cast that bring this movie to life. Sam Shepard in a brief performance is perfect and he may have suggested to the producers to cast his ex Jessica Lange in Meryl's role. This film took a bit to get released.

They should have put this movie in, instead of giving me anesthesia, then again it might have caused more pain.
The acting was well done but the movie was pointless, it was just another dark dysfunctional family type movie, basically the same old story line just different people.

During the after burial dinner there isn't one of my family members who would not have been long gone within 15 minutes of the opening dinner grace! Insult after insult and they all just sat there?

I watched the entire movie thinking there has to be something good here, some moral or lesson, there isn't.  It is  a depressing film that leaves you depressed.  There is no resolution to any of the issues.  I love a good drama and I have no issues with heavy movies or movies that address hard issues, but give me something to hope for, some reason to like these people.  You gave me nothing.

Someone was trying to write a movie about deconstructing relationships and what it looks as a second and third generation dysfunctional family in the middle of nowhere, it didn't work. There was no originality and some lines they pulled from Sixteen Candles- if they were trying to be the anti-John Hughes, they did accomplish that.

Nicholson, Roberts and Cooper turn in fine performances but Meryl Streep, as the mean spirited, outspoken and pill addicted matriarch takes the cake with one of the best performances I have seen in a long time.

The story revolves around one household and three adult sisters (Nicholson, Roberts & Lewis) returning home when their father (Shepard) goes missing.  Any size house could not hold the resentment and anger that is present between Roberts & Streep.  Roberts plays the proverbial chip off the block very well showing a nasty, tongue lashing, side that is not her normal character.  Chris Cooper the brother in law/uncle that tries to keep the peace as the tension in the family begins to boil over.

This is the story of a dysfunctional family who is coming to terms with themselves and those around them in a time of sorrow and crisis.

6139557,1,B00H7LJ2UO,This was one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. I kept waiting for something good to happen because it couldn't get any worse. And then it got worse. Every character had their life destroyed in this movie and the language was just too much. I am so sorry I wasted my time watching the whole movie. The only positive thing that happened was when Julia Roberts' character seemed to grasp the destructive pattern and appeared to be walking away from the past into a new future.

Brilliantly acted throughout and not just by Roberts and Streep. All do a great job.

My biggest complaint because I am old school is today's writers who think that the ""F"" word has to be operative word in all movies today. The use of that word in this movie wore me out. Believe it or not, there are other words that people can use to express dramatic feelings.

Great movie for grown-ups who hopefully have had positive childhood experiences. Others might see yourself sitting at that dining room table.",1397433600,,618,4.460176991150442

I just love movies, I am not a nit picker - give me a good story with good actors and I am happy. I don't really agree with others about Julia Roberts being miscast or Meryl Streep overacting (I once knew a woman who was over the top like Violet is so MS acting seemed the usual incredible to me!)

6139567,1,B00H7LJ2UO,"It would be hard to pack more drama, hatefulness, incest, suicide, addiction, lies, secrets and sickness into a two hour movie, but August: Osage County appears to be trying up until the very last second to jam everything in.  What emerges, then, is an overly rich stew, so crammed full of every possible ingredient in mankind's cupboard of dysfunction, it's hard to actually taste anything.  No sooner do we grasp the affects of the father's suicide, then the family is off and running from crisis to crisis, seething resentments to flat-out violence.  The viewer is left with no time to process and understand one miserable event before he/she is treated to five others and asked to somehow find a meaning in this over the top melodrama, aside from this is a seriously messed up family and Meryl Streep sure can act.  Like we didn't know.

Where is the artfulness, the subtlety?  Where is the opportunity to allow the viewer to slowly dissect the complexities of these character's psychologies?  This isn't a taste - this is a force feeding, a two-hour all you can eat buffet of anger and misery, with a side order of crazy.  I'm sorry, I prefer movies where you get drawn in, not movies where you are endlessly assaulted with in your face angst.

Here is the 21st century rendition of Long Day's Journey Into Night, presented to you without any of the finer craftsmanship and profundity - a smorgasbord of every weakness and tragedy known to mankind.

If on the other hand you are seeking a dark, complicated look at a severely dysfunctional family with flashes of acting genius, this is your  flick. Streep is unrelentingly cruel and achingly pathetic as the matriarch of the family who is coping with a cancer diagnosis and the suicide of her poet husband.
The plot centers around the family returning for the funeral and the combative reaction of Streep to her three daughters. Julia Roberts plays one of the three daughters in a heavy handed performance. However, it is almost unfair to hold any actress up to the gold standard of Streep. Several of Streep's scenes are mind numbingly pitiful, especially a scene near the end of the movie where she reminisces about wanting a pair of boots to attract a boy she thought of as a prospective suitor.
The supporting chapters are played well by a host of well known actors including Juliette Lewis and Delmot Mulroney.

Cumberbatch shoulda stayed home. The rest delivered competent work that shows actors can make ashes shine.  The  characters represent the stupidly comfortable among us; they convince us our culture fails its children: trailer trash with money.  The high point of the script is a contrivance about incest that is unnecessary and awkward.  What does it mean?

All of the actors here are remarkable, including Julia Roberts, Chris Cooper, Juliette Lewis, Ewan McGregor, to name just a few.

One pre-requisite to liking this film is some understanding of family dysfunction. I can see why so many find this film depressing and hopeless. It is. But it's a reality for so many people. Prescription drug addiction is an epidemic in small town and rural America. What was especially telling for me was how we learn of the very components that made the Streep character and her sister so vile and mean. Born of hard-scrabble depression-era stock, we see the family skeletons and their progeny. Brilliant but twisted drama, because it is so spot-on, and it takes courage for a writer to portray the ugliness that's unfortunately woven into the fabric of so many American lives.",1397347200,3,973,4.8969696969696965

I don't mind heavy drama -- but there is almost always at least one moment of optimism or faint hope for survival or improvement or even just comic relief. This never happens in this film. It's just dark, heavy, sad and miserable, and at no point does the sun break through even for an instant. I will add that the trailers are terribly misleading. When I had seen the trailers on TV, the extracts from the movie made it seem as though the nasty remarks exchanged between the Roberts and Streep characters were almost funny -- sort of black comedy.

The lead characters, specifically the characters that Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, and Margo Martindale have some anger issues and negativity about them, but the performances are so great you can't stop watching.

If you don't like stage to film,  I wouldn't bother.  However,  I was enthralled by every line and scene in this perfect film.

An odd observation, considering all of the wide shots of the barren Oklahoma plains.  I would call the vista spacious (for thematic reasons of wanting to emphasize vast empty spaces).  The narrative plot was concentrated, but no more so than a ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  As the plot evolved, the story opened wider and wider, allowing for extra spaces that had not been foreseen. The ensemble cast was remarkable. Each performance well cast and spot on. Meryl never surprises me.  She delivers the kind of perfection in her characterization of Violet that we have come to expect from Meryl in everything she does.  But let's not take her performances for granted.  She is only making it look easy.  She may appear to be a cancer-ridden, drug-addicted shrew.  But there are more layers and a few surprises beyond that surface level.  The one who blew me away was Julia Roberts as eldest daughter Barbara, who has borne the burden of this dysfunctional family.  Julia Roberts is a mature actress who conveys in her every breath & gesture Barbara's exhaustion, contempt, & disgust.  P.S.  Julianne Nicholson is luminous & telegenic.  Glad someone went out and found her for this part.",1397088000,,1336,4.90625
6139632,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"If you don't like to hear cursing and you don't like to see dysfunctional families at play, then definitely don't watch this movie. But if you like amazing performances that leave you shaking your head at one moment and laughing out loud at another, then you need to watch this film.

First, this movie is not about Meryl Streep's character, Violet, and how she strong arms everyone with her wicked tongue. Yes, she does that but the movie is not about her. It's actually about Julia Robert's character, Barbara, who is Violet's daughter, and how she comes to realize over the course of a week with her crazy family that she is just like her mother. For better or worse - they are two peas in the same pod.

For Babara to come to that epiphany, she first has to endure the disappearance of her father, the disclosure of a long buried family secret, her young teen daughter being hit on by her sister's fiance' (played by Dermot Mulroney), battling with her mother's addiction to pain killers as a result of cancer treatment, and the open admission that her husband (Ewan McGregor) has left her for a younger woman. Through it all, there are tons of cursing and ""truth telling"" as Meryl Streep's character calls it and it happens with brutal and dark depictions.

There are some hilarious scenes during the film but you should not for one moment think this is a comedy. Instead, we watch with a growing sense of foreboding as Julia Robert's character transforms from a loving mom and wife (as portrayed in the car scene when they arrive at the family home) into a snarky and unhappy person trying to hold everything together while the world around her falls apart. Her sisters are immature, her husband is a flake, her mother has terminal cancer, and her daughter walks around in her own little teenage bubble.

Now some people think that the end suggests that Barbara (Julia Roberts) leaves her mother alone in the house and is finally happy. I, however, think the ending shows the opposite - that though she tries to leave, Barbara understands that she has no choice but to accept her fate and embrace who she is - her mother's daughter. And Barbara makes peace with that and smiles. But that's just my opinion.

6139636,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"There is a line in Tracy Letts' Pulitzer Prize winning play he has transformed into a screenplay for AUGUST, OSAGE COUNTY that states `Thank God we can't tell the future, we could never get out of bed.' And in many ways that is the mood of this grim examination of a dysfunctional family living in the plains of Oklahoma, in this case baked by the August heat and the suicide death of the patriarch. John Wells directs what could possibly be one of the finest collections of contemporary actors of the day possible and the result is a stultifying, immensely well-crafted film. Gustavo Santaolla provides the atmospheric musical score that underlines the tension and provides breaks in the stifling displays of hate that fill this story.

Violet Weston (Meryl Streep) has cancer of the mouth and is addicted to prescription pills and alcohol. She's a shrewish woman to deal with and her husband Bev (Sam Shepard) has finally had enough: he takes his boat out on the lake and commits suicide. Violet's family gathers including youngest daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), middle daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) with her new fianc&eacute;, the wealthy cannabis loving Steve (Dermot Mulrooney), eldest daughter Barbara (Julia Roberts) with her estranged husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and their teenage daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin), and her fat sister Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale) with her husband Charlie (Chris Cooper) and son Little Charlie (Benedict Cumberbatch). A memorable funeral dinner brings out the secrets and the hostilities and the individual sicknesses of each member of this unsavory family - incest, adultery, lies, and other atrocities and the Weston women are forced to examine themselves and their lives whether they want to or not. Examining all of this gross mess of a family is Native American Johna (Misty Upham) who brings the only semblance of balance as the quiet maid serving these people.

The story is grim, the play was even more grim, and it serves as an opportunity to examine how dysfunctional some families have become in this particular time in history. All actors give exemplary performances and if there were an Oscar for ensemble acting, this film would have won. It may be tough to watch and here at times, but it is a fine piece of American filmmaking. Grady Harp, April 14",1397001600,6,2311,5.031331592689295
6139637,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"My dear old mother, in years not as golden as she'd hoped, has taken a bitter streak.  Listening as she does to the far right end of the Media spectrum, she regularly parrots what she hears and vociferously denounces everything they tell her to, including and especially, Socialism.  Having had enough, I pointed out that, as she and Dad live on his pension and Social Security, they are, by definition, Socialists.  She refused to talk to me until I apologized for insulting her so horribly.

It's been several years now...

My mother, however enraged in her upper years though, has nothing on this mother grizzly and her brood.

Meryl Streep once again goes over the top in her performance, although I've developed something of a hobby in noting when certain Streep characteristics pop through her characters----the way she points off to the right with her hand;  that explosive, deep-throated guffaw.  Here, playing a woman who's dying from mouth cancer, and who has been addicted to pills of various types for years, she alternates between an ill fitting black wig, and her own raggedly cut short graying blond hair, and aside from her widows weeds at the funeral, she rarely dresses in more than a house coat and night gown, so she alternates between a very weak self deception, and a dressed attitude that is as bleak in appearance as her prognosis.

When ""Before Midnight"" came out, a few reviewers here compared the bicker fest between the two protagonists of that film to ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolfe"", the epic Taylor-Burton brawl of the 1960's.  What an insult to Taylor and Burton's performance!  This film is much closer.  There are secrets.  There is regret.  Mom isn't just dying, she know's what went on behind her back, and she's also as selfish as they come.  Her own mother was a piece of work, at one point giving her a box with men's work boots, caked in mud and manure, for Christmas, when she had asked for a pair of girls boots she saw in a store---and then laughed at her reaction to it, for days.  Julia Roberts tries, as the eldest daughter to help her mother, to confront her addiction to pills, to draw her out on her rather odd reaction to her father's suicide, which happens early in the film.  But it's never quite clear if the three daughters are all merely the walking wounded or have agendas of their own.  Like a brush fire, the anger rises and falls, spreads rapidly and just as rapidly dies down, only to flare up, yet again, at some seemingly insignificant spark.

Behind it all is the flat, sere, brooding, Oklahoma landscape, quietly enforcing the misery of the participants of this family meltdown.

I haven't seen a film quite like this one since I can remember.  Today's films, like the aforementioned ""Before Midnight"" just can't seem to rise to the level of tenseness that they went to back when, probably because the cast members aren't usually as substantial as some of the old actors---the earlier generation, such as Burton and Taylor, went through Depression and World War, of course, and that tends to give you a perspective on life that several generations of stability and peace (when the nation isn't bullying some third world dictator it once supported)  don't quite provide.

And, despite all the drama, like life, sometimes the dark moments have their funny sides...

You'd probably have to be ready to sit down to a film like this, with so much angst and regret being hurled about, but I found it to be one of the best films I've seen in the past few years and I think many others will come to the same conclusion.",1397001600,,3577,4.69551282051282

Oklahoma in the summer is suffocating, summer in Osage County is worse. Not because of the stifling heat, but because of the horrible behavior of this suffocating family. If you think your family has troubles, 'you Ain't seen nothing yet'.

The film opens as Beverly, the patriarch, played by Sam Shepard is talking about the family to the new housemaid he has hired. Bless this woman ,she knows not what she walks into. We have Violet, Bev's wife, played by Meryl Streep, in another magnificent role. She is the kind of woman you never want to meet. We Learn her mother was mean,vindictive and abusive, and that describes Vi to a 'T'. The entire family comes home when the father goes missing. Daughters, Barbara, played by Julia Roberts; Julianne Nicholson, plays Ivy,and Juliette Lewis plays Karen. This family is hard to take. Barbara, her husband played by Ewen McGregor and her daughter, come home and all is not well with this portion of the family. Margo Martindale, who plays Mattie Faye, Vi's sister, is almost as mean and nasty. Her husband played by Chris Cooper has some real balls, but too late. Benedict Humberbatch plays the son, whipped and beaten into shape by Mattie Faye.

The film certainly captures your interest. One nasty scene after another where we get to know them all. The acting is so superior, it keeps the film intact, and us glued to the screen. One thing after another as the family disintergrates and falls apart. We can see them going, and it is one of those films, you will long think about. Julia Roberts is superb, as are all of the actors, but she and Streep earn accolades. Not for the faint of heart.

Meryl Streep gives one of her best performances ever. If you've seen and appreciated her raw performance in Ironweed you'll love her in this one. All of the characters are touching and vulnerable. Emotions rumble like bubbles in a boiling pot. Julia Roberts is very believable as she plays the part of the ""strong daughter"" who is pushed to her limits. There are so many twists and turns in this family of trouble and disfunction (as life often is) that even though the movie is long you're never bored. For me the memorable supporting actors are Sam Shepherd (of course) as the troubled but endearing father; Margo Martindale as the bossy and overbearing aunt; and Benedict Cumberbatch as the gentle but insecure cousin/brother. Misty Upham is an actress that I'm not too familiar with, but she did an awesome job as the live in caregiver. She was very believable and showed much expression through her quiet communication as her part was limited verbally. I intend to try and catch her in the soon to be released movie, ""Jimmy P.""

6139669,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"Okay, first a note and suggestion:  As I post this, there are already 36 reviews posted on Amazon for ""AOC"".  The BD and DVD won't be released until April 6th (though Digital Download starts on March 28th).  I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as review of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by ""Most Recent"" first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to my review of the DVD (non-Bluray) version. As I understand it the bonus features are the same on both the DVD and BD for this release.

In the last three years I've (now seen AOC) in FOUR different ""formats"" and I always find something new in it (whether is be one of playwright Tracy Letts' clever lines, or a body movement by one of the cast members). I first saw the ""touring"" stage version starring Estelle Parsons. Next was a wonderful stage production here in Philadelphia by a well-known local theater company. I saw the film version last year when it played first-run on the big screen and last week I was sent (and watched) the Bluray version of the Weinstein Company film being distributed by Anchor Bay Entertainment. This review is of the BD, including the ""special features"".

I won't spend a lot of time on the script itself - since I'm sure others have commented on that already. I will say that this is a story about ""family secrets"" and therefore I highly suggest that you not read lengthy reviews first, which may include some ""spoilers"". I hate ""spoilers and you won't find any in this review. The film works better when you don't know too much - even the first 15 minutes of the script.

As for the acting, what can I say? Hey this is Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts and Margo Martindale (all Oscar noms!). And the guys in the film are great too. What a surprise for ""Sherlock"" fans to see Benedict Cumberbatch playing a Midwesterner!  I have to admit though that I think the play works better on a stage. The original was (and I guess still is) a three-act, three-hour evening (including intermission). The film runs one minute over two hours. So there is a lot of the script that was cut. And, because director John Wells took the film OUTDOORS (we see lots of wheat fields and country roads)  that take our eyes off the real story by looking at the gorgeous scenery. On stage, there was a three story house and front yard. All the action took place there and your eyes were concentrating on the actors.

So, yes, I liked the film - and more folks will get to see it via the film and DVD version - but, I encourage you to see a stage version should the opportunity arise.

The special features include a feature length commentary with director Wells and the Cinematographer (which I have not yet listened to), About 20 minutes of deleted scenes (which can be replayed with Director and Cinematographer' commentary) and a  ""Making of"" featurette - maybe 16 minutes - which include cast interviews and portions of a Q&A at an identified screening (where much of the talk is how great it is to work with Meryl Streep).  Finally there is a seven minute featurette where playwight Letts comments on his own writing style and why he wrote AOC.

I hope this review was both informative and helpful.

6139670,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"In many ways, AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY, Tracy Letts outstanding Pulitizer Prize-winning play, is reminiscent of the works of Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, William Inge and Edward Albee, in that it involves a family get-together of one sort or another in which long hidden, dark secrets are revealed that, ultimately, destroys the family.

Indeed, just about any viewer can find a character in these dramas that reminds one of their own families.

In Letts drama, directed by John Wells, the dysfunctional Oklahoma clan comes together when the patriarch (Sam Shepard) disappears and is later discovered to be a suicide.  He leaves behind a drug-addicted, strident wife (Meryl Streep), who is suffering from mouth cancer, and three grown daughters: Julia Roberts, Juliette Lewis and Julianne Nicholson, none of whom seem to have their lives going on the right track.

Other family members include Margo Martindale (as Streeps sister), Chris Cooper (Margos husband) and Benedict Cumberbatch as their loser son.  Theres also Ewan McGregor (as Roberts estranged husband) and Abigail  Breslin as their daughter, plus Dermot Mulroney (as Lewis latest boy friend) and Misty Upham as the recently hired Native American housekeeperand probably the most likeable and emotionally grounded character in the group.

Although it could have used a tad more humor, Tracy Letts dialogue is sharp; his many characters fascinating, as their emotional layers are peeled and shocking, unforgivable family skeletons come to light.

Wells has done a commendable job in opening up this stage play, which is brought to life by one of the finest all-star casts assembled in recent memory.  Streep, Roberts, Cooper and the rest of these players are at the top of their game.

Extras on the Blu-Ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment include feature and deleted scenes commentary by director John Wells and cinematographer Adriano Goldman, a Making of featurette and a featurette on writing with Tracy Letts.

I have been one of those people who've always sat on the fence about their opinion on Meryl Streep. Yes, she's good, but when she eats the humble pie and gladly accepts nominations, you wonder who she really is but to CLOUD all that AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY comes and leaves you mesmerised for two hours.

It's a real shame I am not giving this film 5 stars because as good as it is, it doesn't deserve five stars. For one, it hates you, it doesn't even care if you're in the room listening to it going on or not, it takes about ten to twenty minutes to settle down and the wicked drama keeps on hitting you with a surprise after surprise in a very intricately woven plot. This is not some random cockamamie plot, it is wired together in near perfection. The deliverance, the acting, the intent behind every single dialogue and the whole story, the way it comes together and the way it never comes together.

This is the kind of film where not individual scenes shall be recalled but the whole sum product of the film. This means in a year or ten, I shall revisit this film because MERYL STREEP (sorry Julia you rock) does an absolute Lebron James with this.

======================================================

Meryl Streep brings out the best and the worst in her fellow actors.

By this, I mean, she brings out the utter brilliance from others around her.

I don't know if it's because they're all in awe of how many Oscars she's been nominated for, or that they're sick and tired of being out-acted by someone who's been so well awarded and regarded.

Whatever the reasons for her success in encouraging her cast members to perform at their best, what you have in August: Osage County is a fantastically dark bleak horrific world that is so terrible in the psychic wounds it inflicts you cannot help but laugh.

In August: Osage County, the world you visit is not the one you are likely to want to revisit. It orbits around pain and hurt and betrayals so deep that people who live there resort to drinking and pills in order to stay away from their most murderous instinct.
If they didn't listen to music, dance till their bones ached, fought with strangers or curse out their own family... the people who live in this universe would find a gun with so many bullets they would bleed the skulls of every single human being on the planet.

Make no mistake, this is not a happy film.  It will not make you feel great about the planet we live in.  It might even make you consider a long jump off a very short pier and never resurface again.

So with all that I'm saying that's so horribly dark about this film, why watch it?

One word:  Love.

The film is ultimately about Love.

You've read other synopsises here saying that it's a film about a dysfunctional emotional bully of a Matriarch who breaks down her daughters and relatives.  And to an extent yes, that's the surface of the story.  However, what makes this story move is how everyone in the movie want to go from a place of loss to a place of peace.  They make really strange decisions to get there but each person in this very draining film do their best to achieve love they best way they know how.

Even the Matriarch who is ultimately a selfish person, so self involved that she knows nothing about what love really is, has to settle for a store-bought version of love.  And this ""love"" comes in the form of delusion, yearning and the unwillingness to be the change she wants in the world.  In short, she doesn't give love, so she doesn't get love.

The rest of the family fight for their version of this raw and all too real need.  In the end as the credits roll, everyone in the audience were stunned to quiet unseated drained despair that life can be so hard for some of us on planet earth.  It's not a pretty world we live in at times.  We should be grateful if our lives are distanced by time and miles and opportunities to escape our toxic pasts.

August: Osage County may be foreign for some people who come from loving parents and grand parents.  This film is also for you.  To remind you that our world isn't yet perfect and there's still room for a better way forward for us all.  Love is still needed.  It's still a commodity we haven't outstripped demand by an overabundant supply.  This film still invites us towards our better days to come as a human race.

For all the tumult and terrifying moments of angry backlash and unbearable cruelty, I myself appreciated that I am not the only one who grew up in a family I never asked for.  It reminded me there were others out there dealing with far worse.  A note to myself that we're all in this together, like it or not.  To me, this film played like an ode to the end of wars, at home.

I was left wondering why anyone would even want to share it. The characters are so mean-spirited and damaged, manipulative and sour.  There is nothing and no one to be redeemed from this saga.  I say this because I walked away not caring about any single character.  Usually with a family drama, I find myself cheering for someone to rise above it all.  I cannot say the same for this incredibly sad and hateful collection of people.  I regret seeing it.  If you must, wait to see it at home.",1392336000,4,667,4.584745762711864

Every single actor is this movie is superb, notably Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, and Margo Martindale.

The audience is dragged into this disfunctional family, that is simultaneously relatable and completely over-the-top.  Characters are three-dimensional, so while we despise them, we also want to forgive.",1392249600,3,484,5.413333333333333
6139681,2,B00H7LJ2UO,"Meryl Streep has never been one of my favorite actors, but in the last few years she's been sweeping up around Oscar-season. Proving her chops in films like ""Doubt"" and ""The Iron Lady"", I wasn't surprised to hear the immense buzz surrounding her latest role in ""August: Osage County"". Though her performance shines among the others, I never quite connected with the characters.

Adapted from Tracy Letts' Pulitzer prize-winning play, the film centers around the highly-dysfunctional Weston family. After a recent tragedy, estranged mother Violet (Meryl Steep) is forced to reunite with her strong-willed daughters. Each scene is utterly predictable, and the emotional moments don't come off as natural as they should.

Shot almost identically to the play, John Wells doesn't bring any of his own flare or style to the direction. However, the strong performances by Streep, Julia Roberts, and Margo Martindale elevate the film to some degree. Unfortunately, they aren't able to save it.

Over the course of a few days, several essential truths about their lives are brought to the surface after years of denial with destructive consequences.  In terms of plot, John Wells' film has strong melodramatic echoes, most notably in the way familial skeletons in the cupboard are revealed so as to prevent any relationship between Little Charles Aiken (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Ivy Weston (Julianne Nicholson's).  What makes it compelling is the quality of the performances: as the vengeful matriarch Violet Weston, Meryl Streep spits vitriol in almost every speech - years of living an isolated existence with an uncommunicative spouse (Sam Shepard) have warped her nature.  Although racked with cancer, she demands no sympathy from her daughters; on the contrary, her belief in her impending death gives her license to tell the truth about their existences.  As her daughter Barbara, Julia Roberts begins by trying to match her mother for emotional strength, but discovers to her cost that this is a sure-fire way towards isolation.  Ewan McGregor, as her long-suffering spouse, eventually walks out on her,  The third daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) appears to have been emotionally scarred at a young age; unable to cope with the demands of returning to her family, she departs permanently for Florida.  Adriano Goldman's cinematography appears to contrast the rolling Oklahoma landscape with the prison-like atmosphere of the family homestead, but as the film unfolds, we understand that the landscape itself is as much of a prison as the house.  With no other properties - or anything in terms of civilization - in sight of the house, there is not much hope of anyone escaping their miseries of existence.",1391731200,13,1943,5.182108626198083

But essence of the story is still very much there. I will try not to give anything away, because it is worth going on this journey with them.

It starts out innocently enough with few very funny exchanges between a husband and a wife. The story unfolds as each character is introduced and we get more of the story of each member of the family and their relations with one another. As difficult as the story line is from the start, movie had us (entire theatre) laughing out loud for about the first half of it. But as more layers of these dysfunctional people were lifted and more past unveiled laughter slowly started to disappear. So much ugliness, darkness, meanness. No amount of humor could cover that up. I just sat there and could not believe so much venom could come out of one person and have it all directed toward her children. And then you discover the rest of the family and their darkness. I am sitting here finding myself unable to describe what I felt. And I don't think I can, not adequately anyway. The film opened with a quote Life is too long and this movie answered the question how that could be. What I can describe adequately is acting by every single person in this movie  superb.

If this movie (subject matter) or its characters were likable in the slightest it would win every Oscar. Word of caution: profanity galore.

6139688,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"To say this is a black comedy is to put it mildly. I heard the criticism before I saw it, that it was a concept better suited to the stage, but that's nonsense. Tracy Letts who wrote the Pulitzer Prize winning play pens this screenplay and since I didn't see it on Broadway I am happyto see his work any way I can. The premise is this, the patriarch is an alcoholic who disappears and is later found dead of an apparent suicide. The extended family reunites at the home of he and his angry, pill addled wife and Southern gothic chaos ensues. There are deep resentments, lies, bitter childhoods, and addictions galore all of which build until they explode. At it's center is violet, the pill popping matriarch is like a vortex only meaner. Her both subtle and dramatic changes in mood are so well crafted by Streep that it is a master class in acting, it's cliche but so true in this case. Just when you think all of this venom is spewed because she is high, she sobers up(not by her own choice) and the machinations become more subtle but just as vicious.
Another star turn is given byJulia Roberts, I never knew she could be as good as she is as in this as Violet's daughter Barbara. She is as stubborn as her mother if not more and has just been left by her husband for a younger woman. The two go at it like battering rams winding up on the floor wrestling over a bottle of pills. Every actor rises to the occasion of these brilliant words. Another standout is Violet's sister Mattie Fay played by the brilliant stage and screen actress Margo Martindale. Family secrets keep coming and unbelievably so do the laughs, you are almost a little uncomfortable laughing but you do, you will also cry.

6139689,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"John Wells (Shameless, The Company Men) directed this well craft interpersonal drama of real characters and a very real story about a family intertwining their lives back together after a serious tragedy. Taken from an original screenplay by Tracey Letts (Killer Joe) based on his stage play, August: Osage County is something everyone should see.

Another tour-de-force performance by Meryl Streep (Doubt, The Hours) once again as she proves she has more layers and colors in her performances and just when you thought youve seen her do it all, shes back again on screen doing something new and fresh. As the Matriarch of the family coming together for her husbands death, Meryls character is struggling with drug addiction, cancer and all with the moral fiber of a cotton ball. Her oldest, and most bitter daughter, is poignantly played by Julia Roberts (Peter Pan, Pretty Women). Julia and Meryl have some amazing scenes together and watching them fight as mother and daughter is electrifying!

Julia also has some incredibly real and funny, but heartbreaking, family issues/scenes with her husband played dutifully by Ewan McGregor (Big Fish, Moulin Rouge). His innocents and passion are clearly what sharpen both the relationship between him and Julia but also their daughter played by Abigale Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine, Signs).

Now another stand out and amazing performance comes from Chris Cooper (The Muppets, American Beauty) as the husband of Margot Martindale (The Millers, Million Dollar Baby) and the father of Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into Darkness, Sherlock). Chris has one of the most amazing scenes defending his son from Margot and it will literally lift your spirits and make you angry at the same time. Benedict does some amazing shy and persecuted acting with an emotional layer I have never seen him do before. They all are really amazing.

Julianne Nicholson (The Red Road, Boardwalk Empire) plays the middle sister with a very private secret that will literally shake the family tree apart (leaf by leaf) once its revealed. Her sister, and the youngest of the three girls is played by Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Whats Eating Gilbert Grape) who is more than a little out of it as well as introducing her new (much older) fianc&eacute; to the family who is played by Dermot Mulroney (My Best Friends Wedding, Big Miracle).

By the way, Meryls husband, although a small role, was subtly, yet masterfully played by Sam Sheppard (Simpatico, Fool For Love). He is the catalyst for many events in this film.

This movie was very real and visceral in all the performances but the amazing dynamics of Meryl, Julia and Chris are just what set this family film on its ear. This film has so much real dialogue and actions, that if you are like most of us, you will literally feel like you are watching your own dysfunctional family right on the screen.

6139691,4,B00H7LJ2UO,"***This review contains minor spoilers***

I was surprised to find my local theater almost full for today's viewing of August: Osage County. I had assumed that with the movie being in the second week of its run, and the NFL Championship games on TV, I would have the place to myself. That says a lot about the appeal of Meryl Streep, who is probably the best actor we will ever see. The first thing I noticed was that there was a lot of grey hair present in the audience, and I briefly enjoyed the fact that most audience members were older than me for once.

Despite being listed as a drama, the movie produced plenty of laughs. However, most were in sympathy or shock at the darkness of the subject matter. The laughs came because the movie so keenly observes how dysfunctional families can be. The Weston family takes that theme to the extreme and cannot boast a single member that comes close to what we would consider normal.

If you have seen Eraserhead and remember the scene where Henry Spencer meets his girlfriend's family, you might begin to approach how uncomfortable the atmosphere in the Weston household can be. The opening scene introduces us to Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard), who writes poetry when his alcoholism allows. We quickly realize why he feels the need to escape reality when we meet his wife, Violet (Meryl Streep). She's almost permanently high on a cocktail of pills, and has the appearance of a zombie in these opening shots. Her husband decides to leave in the first few minutes of the story, and we eventually learn that he has committed suicide. This sets off an incredible chain of events as family members start showing up to offer their condolences and attend the funeral.

The movie was adapted from a play, and it feels like it throughout the two-hour running time. This is a story which only uses two or three settings, and most of the time we are in the Weston's home. The acting on display is terrific across the board. As much as I admired Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine, Streep's performance was better. I highly doubt that she'll beat Blanchett on Oscar night because of the nature of the story, but the performance is the best I have seen all year. Despite Streep's towering performance, her supporting cast had a lot to contribute. Julia Roberts deserved her Supporting Actress nod, but I would have to say that every character was portrayed well.

Some of the confrontations in this movie are powerful and memorable. Streep's showdown with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt came to mind a few times as some of the arguments in August: Osage County sizzled and boiled over. One of my favorite scenes involves Chris Cooper saying grace, and in a way it's a microcosm of the entire movie. There are also a couple of major surprises along the way, and I certainly won't reveal them here, but if you're a fan of dialogue and the portrayal of human interaction, you'll admire this movie. That doesn't necessarily mean you will want to see it repeatedly and add it to your home movie collection, but it's worth seeing at least once.

The reason I think it will be ignored at the Oscars is Streep's previous track record and the fact that this story is so unsettling and ugly to experience. That said, the acting took my breath away at times, and I enjoyed seeing the story unfold. I loved listening to Streep, Roberts, Chris Cooper and Julianne Nicholson deliver their lines. I wouldn't consider the movie a fun watch, despite the dark humor, but it does a lot of things extremely well. Like Lincoln, this is one you'll grab from the shelf when you are starving for intelligent dialogue and masterful acting, rather than the sheer pleasure of some movie plots. You'll might well be reminded of chaotic conversations you've had with your own friends or family.

I'll always be amazed at how Meryl Streep seems to become the person she is playing on the screen. It's different every time.",1390089600,26,3925,4.679710144927537

Beverly hires a person (Misty Upham) to take care of Violet because sadly he knows his daughters won't. After his suicide, Violet's three daughters and sister (Margo Martindale) come to her home. Violet is pill drunk, yet incredibly astute as to what is happening. The daughters all have their own issues as they strive to make a mess of their own lives. During this get together, old wounds are opened, new ones created, and secrets revealed.

If the goal of the film is to make the audience feel uncomfortable, this one succeeds as much as ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Indeed I imagined the director viewing the audience wringing his hands as they squirm in their seats. This is not a feel good film, and indeed, I have  family of four cats (mother with 3 daughters) that get along better than this dysfunctional family.

The production is well acted. I was glued to the screen as I watched a tragedy unfold as Barbara (Julia Roberts) turns into her mother.

Set in dusty, sweltering Oklahoma, director John Wells, using an adapted screenplay by Tracy Letts, provides the viewer with the dysfunctional family of the year.  Early on we meet the patriarch, Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard) who is interviewing a woman to care after his cancer-stricken wife Violet (Meryl Streep).  Bev is an alcoholic and Vi is a drug addict.  Her mouth cancer causes severe burning pain so she has buckets of pills which she's happy to take even if she wasn't in pain.

When Bev turns up missing, Vi calls her 3 daughters and her sister to come help find him.  One of the side effects of the narcotics is that they take Vi to a new level of nastiness.  And she's one nasty women even when sober.  Her oldest daughter Barbara (Julia Roberts) comes from Denver with her estranged husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and their daughter, Jean (Abigail Breslin).  Juliette Lewis plays daughter Karen who brings her fianc Steve (Dermot Mulroney).  Julianne Nicholson is the other daughter Ivy who is having an affair with her cousin Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch).  Vi sister Mattie (Margo Martindale) is nearly a match for Vi in terms of her foul mouth, but at least she's sober most of the time.

The film's centerpiece is the verbal violence zinged between Vi and Barbara.  Frankly, it is almost shocking to hear the vitriol coming from Roberts and Streep as these characters.  I suspect they tossed out more F-bombs in this movie than they have in their cumulative careers.  Some of it is uncomfortably funny I admit, but his film is hardly a comedy, even a black comedy.  I was reminded of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" from 1966 where Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton go at it in front of their 2 innocent guests.  But here we have a houseful of guests and verbal grenades are tossed in all directions.

As the family disintegrates before our eyes, secrets long kept surface which complicates the situation even further.  The film isn't for everyone but it is worth seeing for some terrific performances, especially Streep and Roberts.",1390003200,142,2105,4.859550561797753
6139694,5,B00H7LJ2UO,"We ended up at the theatre watching this because it tickled my fiancee's fancy based on some radio interview or other and walked in knowing nothing about it.  We're both glad we went.

The high-level summary of the plot is that there's not much plot.  The family patriarch dies and for the next two hours we see the aftermath as the family comes together to grieve (or not) and to dig up old grievances against each other.  I don't really need to tell you much more than that because I think on some level everyone has lived through or seen this situation.  The only variation is the extent to which your own family gets along.  Suffice to say that this family most assuredly does NOT.

The real highlight of the movie lies in the characters themselves and of course with the acting.  With a cast like this it is thoroughly impossible to be anything but immaculately portrayed.  This collection of characters features all the most delightful archetypes of dysfunction:  The harpy shrew of a matriarch who is flawlessly selfish, combative and conniving, the daughter(s) who escaped her and hopped from man to man for validation, the in-law who tries to feel up the teenager and of course everyone seems to have cheated with someone else.  The full range of human frailty and family dysfunction is on display.

In the end this was a wonderfully real movie.  Some reviewers have criticized this movie as 'over the top' and unbelievable and I assure you that it absolutely is NOT.  This sort of thing happens every day and if anything it's slightly less dramatic than reality.  It is my sad duty to report that plenty of people live their lives in just this way and it's why not everyone goes home for the holidays.  All that said, it's a movie you probably need to be n the mood for.

For those who enjoy this type of movie, it is well worth watching. For those who don't, I suggest you watch something else.

What is it about?

The patriarch of a family- an author- dies. His funeral brings the family together to their home- in Osage County Oklahoma.

The story unfolds as the tensions amongst the family members come to the surface. The focal point of the tensions is the matriarch of the family, played by Meryl Streep brilliantly. She certainly puts the ""vile"" into Violet (the name of her character).

Relationships within the family are dysfunctional. The story focuses on the relationships, and the brewing tensions. Some of the interactions amongst the characters are caustic.

The performances uniformly are masterful and faultless, and the transition of the stage play to the screen largely has been achieved successfully. At times, you do have the impression this originally was written for the stage.

If you are familiar with the stage play, this will reward you as a great performance of it- albeit condensed from the full stage version. If you want to see great performances from fine actors playing complex and dysfunctional characters, and portraying the characters in a believable way- again this is rewarding.

For anyone else, it may be something of a chore to sit through it.

6139696,3,B00H7LJ2UO,"While Streep and Roberts play their individual characters perfectly, the story lacks cohesiveness. It also fails to make the viewer care about the characters. Why ? This is easy. The story is dominated by women who use their mouths in scene after scene to verbally destroy all those around them , using the ""F"" word every other sentence. These people were hard to identify with or care for. The only character who displayed civility or conscience was Mattie's husband , who was disgusted by the sword tongue sisters as they demolished one another.

 This was essentially watching two hours of  self absorbed  people insult , degrade, and humiliate one another with relish and a vocabulary stuck on the sixth letter of the alphabet.

 ( Want to see a movie that compels the viewer to care about the characters with a real story and fabulous acting? Check out Streep in ""Doubt"".  It is worth your time. )",1389484800,9,902,4.743589743589744
