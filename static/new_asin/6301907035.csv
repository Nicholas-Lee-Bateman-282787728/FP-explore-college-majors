A Family Treasury Collection, Fully Animated Feature Length Presentation

Jules Verne's immortal tale is faithfully adapted in this colorful and exciting animation.  The year is 1866 and the place is the picturesque waterfronts of the New England fishing harbors where it is learned that all is not calm at sea: a ""monster"" of mysterious origin is roaming the world's oceans destroying whaling ships, trawlers and ships of war.  The President of the United States assigns a marine expert, Professor Pierre Aronnax, to join the iron-willed sailor Ned Land aboard the frigate Abraham Lincoln.  Their mission is to kill the monster or prove it does not exist.  Almost a year passes with no sign of the monster - until one foggy night it appears to attack and sink the frigate.  Aronnax and Land manage to escape unharmed, but are dragged deep below the surface of the sea where they learn the incredible truth about the ""monster"" and an eccentric, brillant man by the name of Captain Nemo!  Animated cartoon in color, runs approximately 47 minutes.",1155254400,2,1086,4.961325966850829
