7385026,4,B014662H5Y,I can say this series is also good. Though not as good as Eureka Seven The plot can really confuse you.  Takes place after the events of the first Eureka Seven and this isn't about Renton too much.,1446595200,7,197,4.184210526315789

8729845,3,B014662H5Y,"Not as good as the original, this is worth a watch if you liked the original.",1526947200,,77,3.875
8729846,5,B014662H5Y,"E7 AO is a whole new story to go around compared to it's predecessor E7. I am a huge fan of both shows, and I loved them both for their own reasons. Do not believe bad ratings given for this show, although it was not the amazing story E7 offered, E7AO offered something different and more. Watching the whole series the only complaint I would ever give, was the very end, as I had hoped the best for our main hero Ao.",1516147200,,417,4.097560975609756

8729850,4,B014662H5Y,Plot a bit confusing but a couple of more viewing should straighten things out.,1486857600,,79,4.714285714285714
8729851,5,B014662H5Y,"It is a great story line for the continuation of Eureka Seven or what happen afterwards.  Though I wish it had more explanation , but beggars can't be choosers.",1485561600,,160,4.517241379310345
8729852,4,B014662H5Y,The son of Eureka comes to an alternate earth that's not as technologically advanced as the one Eureka 7 is set in. It references events in the movie that you have to see before you watch this series or you'll be lost.,1483488000,,218,4.214285714285714
8729853,3,B014662H5Y,Not as good as its predecessor. Way too short. You'll find yourself wanting more.,1473984000,,81,4.857142857142857
