This story deals with psychoanalysis, the method by which modern science treats the emotional problems of the sane. [But does psychiatry have any scientific basis? Or is it based on beliefs, like opinions?] A woman is summoned to her doctor at an institution. Dr. Constance Petersen gets her to talk; Mary hates men. Then she gets another patient. Dr. Anthony Edwardes is the new chief of Green Manor. He questions the amount of the linen supply. One patient feels guilty; is it a guilt complex? Drugs are ordered for him. Why do people fall in love? Is it based on looks? Does Constance need something? She goes to the Library and takes a book by Dr. Edwardes, a signed edition. She visits Dr. Edwardes, who gets a call. Dr. Edwardes acts strangely in the Emergency Room. Connie notices a difference in Dr. Edwardes signatures. Who are you? He doesnt remember! Then he goes away.

The real Dr. Edwardes nurse shows up with his real picture. A psychiatrist tries to explain what happened. The police arrive to investigate. Is Constance a human glacier? She gets a letter, then goes to a hotel in New York City. The house detective drops by, he uses psychology. Connie visits his room and talks to him. Can she unlock his mind? Is he imagining this as a guilt complex? His left hand is injured like from a burn. They leave because her picture is in the newspaper! They will go to Rochester to avoid the police. Can he remember his past? They visit Dr. Gouloffs office, two detectives are there. Connie tells him they need a place to stay. The white bedspread affects John. Later the white shaving cream affects him. When Connie wakes up she sees Dr. Gouloff slumped in a chair. He put a bromide in Johns milk! Did John kill Dr. Edwardes? Connie asks for a few days before calling the police.

John remembers nothing about his past. He tries to remember, and tells about his dreams. They will go to Gabriel Valley. The police identify Dr. Petersen . Connie and John go skiiing downhill. John remembers an accident from his past! His name is John Ballantine; he met Dr. Edwardes as a patient, they went skiing, and Dr. Edwardes went over a cliff. The police detective arrived, they trailed them from the station. They found a bullet in Dr. Edwardes back! Ballantine is convicted. What can Connie do now? I knew Dr. Edwardes slightly. Connie thinks about this remark from Dr. Murchison. She talks to him about Ballantine and her interpretation. Dr. Murchison agrees with her diagnosis and takes action.

Is there any scientific basis for psychoanalysis? No explains Michael T. Kennedy, MD FACS, on page 421 in his book A Brief History of Disease, Science and Medicine. Mental illness is a concept, it is caused by a physical illness. Was the death of Ballantines brother really an accident? Pushing him into a metal picket fence seems deliberate. How was this investigated? The story tells about rail travel in 1945, before the super highways were built in the 1950's and air travel became common.",1522627200,,3016,4.728136882129277

8556123,5,B00AQ6DQBS,"SPELLBOUND was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and produced by David O. Selznick in 1945. As the story unravels it is essentially a murder plot interwoven around psychiatrists and psychoanalysis. It is actually Alfred Hitchcock's approach to the story and his collaborations with composer Miklos Rozsa and surrealist artist Salvador Dali that highlights this film. Gregory Peck plays John ""J.B."" Ballantine who poses as a psychiatrist while in a state of amnesia. Uncovered by Dr. Constance Peterson played by Ingrid Bergman, Ballantine must find out if he is responsible for the death of the missing psychiatrist that he posed as and simultaneously discover his own identity. Miklos Rozsa's score is both romantic yet eerie as Ballantine tries to remember what happened through analysis of his dreams. Alfred Hitchcock hired Salvador Dali to design illustrations and paintings in order to construct a crisp and vivid rendering of these dreams. Hitchcock did not want to use conventional techniques such as blurred camera shots to recreate the dreams. He wanted them to be as clear and even sharper than the rest of the film. He wanted Dali's style of using shadows, lines of convergence and the idea of infinite distance incorporated into the dream sequences. In the dream sequence we see a black stage highlighted with people at gambling tables with huge mysterious looking eyes peering over them. A man cuts away at the fabric of one eye with a giant scissors revealing another eye. In another part of the dream we see a man standing on a roof behind a chimney that has sprouted roots. The hooded man holds what looks like a deformed or eccentric wagon wheel in his hand. In the distance there is a formation of rocks and boulders, which look like they are sprouting into the shape of a man's head. Another part of the dream shows a man running down a pitched geometric plane as the shadow of a bird follows him. In the background there are geometric shapes and lines that go off into infinity. All these images must be interpreted into experiences from reality. Dali's images are unsettling and thought provoking. Eventually, the eccentric wagon wheel turns out to represent the chambers of a revolver pistol and reveals the true identity of the murderer. A surrealistic painting brings to the canvas an image from reality but puts it into a context of the unreal. I think Dali was successful in translating the realistic elements from the plot into a vision of incomprehensibility of the conscious human mind. Hitchcock and the scriptwriter Ben Hecht then had their characters translate Dali's images back into plausible reality. This is brilliant filmmaking years ahead of its time.",1415059200,,2685,5.008948545861298
