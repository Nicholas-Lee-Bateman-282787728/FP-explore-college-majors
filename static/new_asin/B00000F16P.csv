1202924,4,B00000F16P,"Warning: ""Ganja and Hess"" is not your traditional, cliched vampire film. In fact, there's little about this haunting, confusing movie that IS in any way ordinary -- it's a fragmented, weird movie painted in a surreal palette. Director/writer/actor Bill Gun crams this strange movie with feverish visions and Christian symbolism, and while it frequently doesn't make sense it's still hypnotic.

Anthropologist Dr. Hess Green (Jones) had been ancient civilization of Myrthia, and upon returning home he hangs out with his unbalanced research assistant George. Then George goes insane, stabs him with an ancient bone knife, and then kills himself. But Hess doesn't die -- he immediately heals and develops a craving for blood.

Enter Ganja (Marlene Clark), George's beautiful wife. She and Hess fall madly in love and happily stays with him as the new mistress of his house... and then, of course, she finds out his dirty little secret, as well as her hubby's body. What is ahead for Ganja and Hess, and how long can a vampire live with his own conscience?

By the usual standards, ""Ganja and Hess"" is a failure -- there's no linear storytelling, no ""hero"" or ""villain"" characters, it doesn't explain anything, and I didn't know what was going on for pretty much the first half of the movie (seriously, who's the masked white guy?). Presumably that's why the idiot producers of this movie chopped it up and redistributed it as a wildly different movie.

But even though it's slow, choppy and often confusing, ""Ganja and Hess"" is absolutely hypnotic. Bill Gunn's hazy, feverish, slow-moving direction leaves you feeling like you're on a magnificent drug trip, drifting through the increasingly chaotic life of cultured ""vampires."" And the growing sense of horror in this movie is kept subtle, such as when Hess kills a young prostitute for her blood while her baby cries in his crib.

And at the same time, he deftly folds in fragments of African culture, powerful Christian belief (specifically, the blood of Christ vs. the bloodlust), and drug addiction (Hess's craving for blood is like a junkie's).

But the movie would collapse like a house of cards if it weren't for Duane Jones and Marlene Clark. Both of them give absolutely stunning performances that carry the film through from start to finish. Clark is brilliantly feisty and strong-willed as Ganja, and she's so beautiful that you can't look away; Jones gives a spellbinding performance as a man torn between his primal bloodlust and his conscience.

""Ganja and Hess"" is not for people who are looking for another ""Twilight"" -- it's an arty, befuddling movie that still manages to suck you in. Pun intended.",1283212800,5,2665,5.015837104072398
1202925,5,B00000F16P,"As the title reveals, this film is part revelation and part exploration of vampirism as addiction. The exploration transcends substance abuse to delve into sexuality, power, money, religion and moral redemption. The cinematography is surreal and the plot is deep - Bill Gunn stuck it to the man in delivering a work of art superior to their concept of gothic blaxploitation horror. The film almost died because of it.",1273104000,2,417,5.057971014492754
1202926,5,B00000F16P,"Ganja and Hess is one of those movies that, if you have heard about, you have heard it discussed in the terms used by all the reviewers thus far. Throw all of that away. What this is... is art. The story is masterful, the acting nuanced and subtle, the over-arching story intriguing and the ""twist"" unexpected enough to leave your jaw hanging open as you understand what you just watched.

Many people call this film ""confusing"" -- however, it isn't confusing at all. It demands that the viewer make the same leap of faith we make when we read a text and simply ""ingest"" the action, the characters, and the narrative which is not immediately transparent. You are gonna have to work for it. Wait for it. Keep your eyes and ears open and really pay attention.

This movie does display some of the motifs of this era so there is full frontal male nudity, there are boobies of all body types, there is some stark reality, but this is one of those movies I would have loved to have watched as a young kid... but it is, perhaps, not for the youngun's.

James S. Hinton passed not too long ago and so it is really a joy to watch his cinematography... because it is true, this is an ESPECIALLY beautiful movie.

If you have watched too much Hollywood pap and have lost all sense of imagination, creativity... you should probably pass this one by because it is not giving itself to you the way in which you are used (i.e. it is not spoon-feeding you as much as leading you along a path, beckoning you to enter). However, if you remember and like some story with your entertainment, some meat with your movie, treasure thinking about the ways things happen: Watch this movie. You'll never thank yourself enough.",1165881600,19,1701,4.495145631067961
1202927,3,B00000F16P,"While this movie is termed ""legendary"", Ganja and Hess is one of those movies that are better in the ideas they present rather than the actual film. Ganja and Hess has its profound moments; it has incredibly intense and sensual imagery as well as a beautiful soundtrack but the plot is very unclear. I honestly don't blame others for wanting to edit the film because the actual storyline is hard to find beneath the dream sequences and the symbolism.
Ganja and Hess is thought-provoking, but flawed. That's all there really is to say about it. I do recommend watching Abel Ferrara's film The Addiction as a companion piece to Ganja and Hess, which explores some of the same ideas.",1098921600,3,680,4.722689075630252
1202928,1,B00000F16P,"I had heard of this movie for so many years, first as a kid reading ""Famous Monsters,"" then as a film buff who kept hearing and reading tales of a complex and challenging vampire film that the distributors wouldn't release. I was thrilled when I got my hands on this DVD. I must say I've liked my share of oddball, offbeat films that few others seem to connect with, and it was with that spirit that I went into ""Ganja and Hess."" Sadly, despite what ""art"" some see in it, ""Ganja and Hess"" is a total mess and a waste of time. It's execution is amaturish and it's plot is hopelessly muddled (except of course if you view plot as something that just interferes with the artist making his point). You could call this the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of blaxploitation films, but that would be an insult to ""Plan 9"" and suggest that ""Ganja and Hess"" is fun in a bad movie sort of way. It's not. It's just bad. I get the idea that Ben Gunn has some sort of point to make, but by the time he gets around to making it, you're so numb you just don't care anymore. If you're looking for a good vampire film from the ""blaxploitation"" period, ""Blacula"" is coming to DVD soon. And if you're looking for art, look elsewhere. You won't find it here.",1073088000,5,1232,4.246808510638298
1202929,3,B00000F16P,"This is an odd movie to say the least. Dr. Hess Green (Duane Jones) acquires the ""addiction"" from a ceremony while travelling in Africa and becomes, basically, a vampire. Not your standard fictional vampire mind you, but someone who has a hunger for blood and cannot die. After that, all similarities with your standard vampire end. He walks in the daylight, sleeps in a bed, goes to church and does not have fangs. He lives on a large estate and has a butler and chauffeur who take care of him. There is a bit of narration from the butler who knows about the doctor's affliction, but it is mostly to get us up to speed at the beginning of the film. A ways into the film Ganja (Marlene Clark) comes to stay with Dr. Hess. She finds evidence of strange goings on and tells Hess an interesting story from her childhood. Somehow this leads to their getting married and him performing the ceremony on her to give her the same affliction he has.
There are parts of the film that have a lot of dialog and then other parts that have very little, if any. There are also some extended scenes from a gospel singing church that look more like a documentary than a fictional vampire movie. Flashback scenes are interspersed with dream sequences and at times it is difficult to tell if it is present reality or a dream. There are a few violent scenes where the doctor feeds including one at a whorehouse where he somewhat violently kills his victim and laps up the blood that has spilled. In another scene he robs a medical clinic, walking away with their supply of blood in his leather satchel.
I can't say that this is a great movie, but it is somewhat entertaining, if not a little slow. When the film was first screened the producers were disappointed that it was not a traditional ""blaxpoitation"" film and cut it down from 110 minutes to 78 minutes. It bombed and was soon forgotten.
All Day Entertainment released the fully restored dvd to much fanfare from fans of the movie back in 1998 and it is still in release. There is an essay from Tim Lucas and and a commentary from producer Chiz Schultz, actress Marlene Clark, cinematographer James Hinton and soundtrack composer Sam Waymon. The full retail price is [X] and I am certainly glad I rented it from Netflix instead of buying it, but some collectors might consider it for their collection, mostly those intereseted in really offbeat, independent vampire films, or collectors of interesting black cinema (blaxploitation it is not).",1037491200,7,2480,4.625850340136054
1202930,3,B00000F16P,"Bill Gunn's Ganja and Hess, originally released in 1973, has had a checkered career, to say the least.  It was chopped, slashed, re-edited, and re-released no less than FIVE times throughout the 70s and 80s with five additional titles--very likely a record.  Its original length of 110 minutes was sliced down to 78 minutes by Fima Novick in the original chopped version (Blood Couple), but as Tim Lucas points out in his terrific essay included in this DVD release, Novick introduced a few elements missing from the original that were actually helpful in clarifying the action.
This DVD release is the full director's cut and that is all to the good.  Yet this version of the film is hard to follow unless you have some backstory.  For example, without knowing that the main character, a black intellectual, Hess Green, somehow came across a Myrthian dagger and then accidentally (or is it on purpose?) was scratched or stabbed with it by his assistant, George Meda (played by the director himself)--AND that this dagger's touch can bring on vampirism--you would never know how Hess got to be the way he was.  The scene in which this is supposedly revealed has such vague exposition that it leaves you scratching your head trying to figure out how things got from point A to point B.
Yet the film also boasts some brilliant dream imagery, some of the best in any film from the 70s, if not since then as well.  These dream scenes give the film tremendous power.
But the dream scenes are juxtaposed with other scenes that seem somewhat too long for their purpose, or that don't really go anywhere.  For example, in one scene, deleted from the chopped version, Hess talks to his son--who looks to be about 13 or 14--speaking in French to him, asking him about his studies at his private school.  This is no doubt meant to bring out Hess' social and intellectual standing as a man of culture and refinement.  But the son is never seen in the rest of the film and the scene seems completely isolated from the rest of the movie.
In another scene, Hess visits a white woman from a trashy part of town.  It's obvious what the purpose of the visit is, and this is no doubt to bring out Hess' conflicted character.  This does work to some extent, in that later on, he goes to church, supposedly for absolution based on his deeds, but there is too much fragmentation of purpose working in this film to make it cohere.
It's a fascinating failure.  Ganja Meda, played by Marlene Clark, is another frustratingly developed character.  She discovers her husband, George, is dead, but while suspicion definitely points to Hess as the perpetrator, she's walks around mad for a couple of minutes and then is lovey-dovey with him.
There are threads here that do fit together and make sense and cohere and there are just as many that don't.  This is not an easily followed film, nor one that lacks intelligence.  With greater coherence, it could have been a brilliant film.  As it is, it is an intriguing, seriously flawed work that comes this close to being an amazing, resonant film.",1021248000,19,3065,4.679702048417132

Ganja, if I got this right, is a doctor of anthropology or some other sort of luminary, and he takes in a hedonistic, debauched assistant who goes a little nuts and stabs Ganj with a cursed knife made of a human bone, and the stab wound grants Ganja immortality, but he has to cope with an insatiable thirst for human blood. He kills the assistant eventually, and against his better judgment, and then he seduces Hess.
This reminded me of the writing of Iceberg Slim or Donald Goines, set in an African American Renaissance that never quite happened, or maybe it did. I didn't get this movie, and maybe I can't because of my own demographic background, but I felt its weird oblong structure, and the huge amount of passion that Duane Jones put into his role is very moving.",1405641600,,867,4.3580246913580245

1202994,5,B00000F16P,"To Be a Black Artist -- By Bill Gunn, 1973

To the Editor: (NY Times)

There are times when the white critic must sit down and listen. If he cannot listen and learn, then he must not concern himself with black creativity.
A childrens story I wrote speaks of a black male child that dreamed of a strong white golden haired prince who would come and save him from being black.  He came, and as time passed and the relationship moved forward, it was discovered that indeed the black child was the prince and he had saved himself from being white.  That, too, is possible.
I have always tried to imagine the producers waiting anxiously for the black reviewers opinions of The Sound of Music or A Clockwork Orange.
I want to say that it is a terrible thing to be a black artist in this country  for reasons too private to expose to the arrogance of white criticism.
One white critic left my film Ganja and Hess, after 20 minutes and reviewed the entire film. Another was to see three films in one day and review them all.  This is a crime.
Three years of three different peoples lives grades in one afternoon by a complete stranger to the artist and to the culture.  A.H. Weiler states in his review of Ganja and Hess that a doctor of anthropology killed his assistant and is infected by a blood disease and becomes immortal.  But this is not so, Mr. Weiler, the assistant committed suicide.  I know this film does not address you, but in that auditorium you might have heard more than you were able to over the sounds of your own voice. Another critic wondered where was the race problem.  If he looks closely, he will find it in his own review.
If I were white, I would probably be called fresh and different.  If I were European, Ganja and Hess might be that little film you must see.  Because I am black, do not even deserve the pride that one American feels for another when he discovers that a fellow countrymans film has been selected as the only American film to be shown during Critics Week at the Cannes Film Festival, May 1973.  Not one white critic from any of the major newspapers even mentioned it.
I am very proud of my ancestors in Ganja and Hess.  They worked hard, with a dedication to their art and race that is obviously foreign to the critics.  I want to thank them and my black sisters and brothers who have expressed only gratitude and love for my effort.
When I first came into the theatre, black women who were actresses were referred to as great gals by white directors and critics.  Marlene Clark, one of the most beautiful women and actresses I have ever known, was referred to as a brown-skinned looker (New York Post).  That kind of disrespect could not have been cultivated in 110 minutes.  It must have taken a good 250 years.
Your newspapers and critics must realize that they are controlling black theater and film creativity with white criticism.  Maybe if the black film craze continues, the white press might even find it necessary to employ black criticism.  But if you can stop the craze in its tracks, maybe that won't be necessary.

This is the kind of film that one must revisit and study up on to further appreciate. It has so much subtext and so many little details to marvel at. It's truly a work of art and one of the only horror films made by a black filmmaker that truly stems from a black artistic sensibility, similarly to Melvin Van Peebles' groundbreaking ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"". Bill Gunn was hired to make a mindless blaxploitation film, but instead winded up making a mesmerizing and fulfilling work of genius that is as complex as it is breathtaking. It's a blessing that it's finally being released on Blu-ray, and with a remastered Director's Cut on top of that, so there's no excuse for fans or curious newcomers alike to not own it. This is a film of enormous importance and significance, and although it's only truly appreciated by a select few, I'm more than happy to be apart of that camp.

The chemistry between Ganja and Hess is so powerful, it's really what makes the film. I think many of the negative review(er)s are taking the film out of its context. Remember this is a 70s BLAXPLOITATION FILM, not a contemporary European (White) film. There are aspects to this film that are authentic to the African American experience. Although the African aspect of it does play into the European ideology that Africa and African things are somehow supernatural or evil, consider American history and the history of African slaves in America. Anyone unfamiliar or ""uncomfortable"" with African American culture will not understand or appreciate this movie in the slightest.

Would suggest that people also get the Film Losing Ground, that they both worked together on some 9 or so years later. The auto commentary on this film is also good.

The movie is so unique because of the way it combines different genres (psychedelia, blaxploitation, horror) and because of its experimental style of photography: superimpositions, soft focus, off-center framing of subjects, and so on. The soundtrack also adds a lot to the film's idiosyncratic, eclectic feeling. The director (Bill Gunn) constantly delves into traditional sources of black culture (the church; African art, fabrics, patterns; jazz and other forms of African American music, etc.) to tell a story with subject matter (vampirism) that has rarely (with the exception of blaxploitation films like Blacula) been of interest to black filmmakers/storytellers. Though the story is perhaps atypical, in that way, for a black storyteller, Gunn emphasizes the ""blackness"" of this narrative by focusing on the physical, corporeal aspects of his nearly all-black cast--their skin, nudity, sweat, and of course, their blood. The brilliance of the story is that it has an almost mythical kind of structure built around the protagonist's journey into a fantastical version of his racial/cultural past. I think it's very interesting that the plot revolves around two visitors--one who came to kill him, and the other who came to love him. The killer wound up giving him eternal life, whereas the lover winds up bestowing mortality. It's a really fascinating meditation on the nature of life and death. As one of the characters says: ""Why do we always call it 'the end of life,' and not 'the beginning of death.'"" I can't recommend this movie enough.
