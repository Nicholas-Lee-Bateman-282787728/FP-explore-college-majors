8750890,4,B01BO7060G,So far I am happy with the quality of the DVD.  Disappointed that is several places---in sometimes crucial plot development scenes---there is no English translation and you have to presume what was said based on when the subtitles pick up again.  For this reason is it a good idea to watch this movie online FIRST so that you will know what is happening.  Otherwise I have watched 2 of the 5 discs and so far everything is working fine.,1485561600,,436,4.493670886075949
