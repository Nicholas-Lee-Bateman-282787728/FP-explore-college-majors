3422825,5,B001957A0S,"Didn't even recall this film when released, but caught the later half on cable!!  It reminds me of some earlier films, e.g. Bob, Carol, Ted & Alice and a few others.  Very well done, especially Molly Shannon subtlely recalling some of her former SNL schtiks!!!  Just a great film to watch with friends, a few beers and some popcorn!!",1278374400,,333,4.610169491525424
3422826,2,B001957A0S,"I watched to the end, but it was a waste of time. The acting was by the book but it lacked depth. Everyone had their part, but it was very formula-matic. I did not buy the 'suicide' sequence. Who did not see that coming from 25 minutes away?

All of the actors did a good job. The script was very poor.

The rental was only $.99, and I feel I overpaid.

There are much better movies out there. Do not wast your time.",1259366400,2,416,3.9879518072289155
3422827,5,B001957A0S,"Wedding Weekend is a fun movie about a group of college friends reuniting after 15 years. They are struggling with the passage of time and losing their youth.
I thought David Harbour was wonderful and loved the scene where he struggles with losing his hair.  He is a young actor to watch.",1243814400,3,288,4.538461538461538
3422828,5,B001957A0S,"Wedding Weekend is smart, funny and makes you yearn for the college days of yore. Old friends get together to sing at a Hampton's wedding and relive the glory days, ogle hot Swedish au pairs, and most importantly, shut up and sing. The different characters' witty antics and dramatic revelations keep a good pace throughout the movie. It's a good film full of emotional ups and downs that we can all relate to.

3422831,5,B001957A0S,"After I heard a comparison to ""The Big Chill"", I rented The Big Chill and wow, has movie making changed. This much updated version of The Big Chill is more like a Hugh Grant movie. Molly Shannon is as crazy as always...and Reg Rogers does his an expert job being the divorcee. All eyes are on the NANNY..and why not. Her laid back Euro approach to life catches the other main players by surprise. We all have our version of ""The Girl in the Mini"" story. And Spooner...in the Monks Robe...All in all, a fun, entertaining picture.",1234051200,8,528,4.453608247422681
3422832,4,B001957A0S,"Another one of those ""old college friends get together"" movies ala The Big Chill or Peter's Friends, starring Molly Shannon and a group of very accomplished but not quite as well-known actors.  Takes place over a long wedding weekend as the former members of a male accapella group (and their respective ladies) get together at a Hamptons mansion to rehearse for a performance at the wedding.  Of course there will be a sex, secrets are revealed and a hot Swedish Au Pair gets thrown into the mix.  A nice time with great actors and lovely Hamptons scenery.",1211760000,13,557,4.721649484536083

This one fell flat a few times with dialogue that just seemed forced and unnatural for the actors.  I also think they were trying to tell so many stories at once that some of them got lost. Like, what happened between the guy getting married and the LA guy that they hates each other? The nanny was there for the baby but she was never with the baby. She didn't seem to fit the role of Hot foreign nanny like Penelope Cruz in ""Spanglish"". There were some funny parts and endearing parts.

Molly ringwald is at her best which is being pathetic vulgar and obnoxious...
The Nanny's comment regarding promiscuous sex was insulting to my integrity
and only added to the stupidity and ignorance of the writer as well as summed up
the ignorance of the group...
The indie actor added nothing at all to the movie...other than a minority so to speak...
Midway through the movie had I a gun I would have shot myself...
I watched the movie to its entirety which left me with the feeling of
why did I bother...
The movie movie given a twist and very little imagination as it was already on the verge of darkness...could have become very entertaining as well as engrossing...
some aspects left out or not ventured into...
the hooker...a scene devoted to this would have taken us from a superficial level to a level of reality...they actually did something...
Gunshot...a shooting would have been awesome...throwing the weekend into a dark abyss...rather than leaving us with again the group unable to even commit suicide
no trip to the hospital...
the wife with all the information about the hamptons and cooking this part could have brought in awesome humor to the movie but again we were left nothing
the entire movie was a serious of poor failures and left you wondering whats next and would anything transpire...

Instead, it's about a group of mostly disgruntled men in various relationship phases (married, divorced, single, womanizer, etc).

They all stay together with their significant others for a weekend to attend the wedding of one of their other has been comrades. They blatantly lust after the pitiful Swedish 23 year old nanny - who is so skeletal thin that it is almost laughable to think that any man would give her a second look. She looks like a 12 year old boy. But I digress... All in front of their wife's/girlfriends who find it somewhat charming.

3422943,4,B001957A0S,"Great acting, funny situations, good singing (albeit the lip syncing was at times obvious). Not usually a big fan of barbershop quartet-type vocals, but the singing and songs blended well with the film, and the actual singing group behind the scenes are quite talented. What was perhaps most enjoyable were the quirky characters and witty script, which realistically portrays everyday flawed people and the up and down, fragile yet strong bonds that are the nature of most relationships, which is evidenced in this film both between the male college buddies and between them and their spouses. Not as hilarious as Hangover nor as romantic as others in this category, but nevertheless a nice, intelligent, believable mix that should prove appealing to both sexes.

3422972,2,B001957A0S,"Title says is all. Acting was cheesy, chemistry of the cast was off, and it was cheaply made.

There is a 4-way stop scene (if you watch, you'll know) where we just said ""enough"" and stopped the movie. We decided to come back to the movie a day later and give it another whirl.

We made it through, it got a little better towards the end, but still it was just not very good. Yes, it has some cliche messages about marriage, but nothing that hasn't been beaten over the head 1000x: Whiny undersexed husbands, divorcees, and unhappy marriages that all magically resolve over the course of the weekend. If the writing and acting was better, the cliches would be fine, but as I mentioned, it wasn't very good.

Not to mention, the constant break out into acapella group singing was like corny icing on the corny cake and sometimes cringeworthy. The chemistry between the male group of friends felt forced for most of the movie in that I felt like I was watching a bunch of actors pretending very hard to be bros versus the real thing. The guys in Hangover are way more convincing, so that should say a lot. Chemistry got a little better 3/4 of the way through where they seem to find their stride.

It was free for me on Prime, so considering that, I don't regret watching it. It was mildly entertaining in the way that you stumble upon a movie on a lazy Sunday afternoon while channel surfing and say ""what the hell"" and watch the thing.

Boy, I'm am so glad I did, however, because, like the 'Big Chill' of several decades ago (and one of my all time favs), the story (unlike the usual Hollywood creations), was down to earth and very believable!  Because it didn't have the latest sexy 'Star De Jour,' the story had something that would surely touch home for most adult viewers.  The soundtrack, like the 'Big Chill,' was outstanding and made better by the cast 'singing' (lip or otherwise) the 'a cappella' numbers, which were mostly a throwback to the male cast's college days, when they were a popular group on campus.  It's charming, funny, poignant, and full of love/hate, pathos, humor, and basically 'real' scenes that hold some 'ah-ha' moments for everyone!!  I'm going to order it from Amazon now....!  P.S. If you are unfamiliar with the 'Big Chill,' this is a 'must see' for movie lovers, from the ACTORS (many who were little known, like the 'Breakfast Club' group, but who became big or highly recognizable!!! to most people!...
Also the actor who played 'the deceased' became a 'super biggie' (not from this film, since you never see his face!!!)...and the soundtrack is one of the BEST!!!",1368403200,2,1321,4.848888888888889

Life doesn't always turn out the way we plan and sometimes as adults we look back on our lives with disappointment because of the things we think we missed out on while totally ignoring the obvious blessings we already possess. I can appreciate the fact that these people looked like real people with real problems that we can all relate to.

3423025,4,B001957A0S,"This film is unique in that it manages to create a group of lovable but pathetic couples. All of the characters are messed up in different ways but also come across as surprisingly real in their goofiness and quandaries. This isn't the funniest movie ever made, but it certainly has some good laughs.",1322092800,,300,4.679245283018868
