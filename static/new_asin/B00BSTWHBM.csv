5670244,3,B00BSTWHBM,"I don't have the book, only the DVD, and the DVD has several very useful tips for going faster on a track. Street riders need not purchase this DVD.  The material is presented in a friendly and casual manner (not academic or clinical), as if you were at the track and Simon was coaching you. The instructional part of the DVD was shorter than I expected, and the part about Simon's personal life, was longer than I expected.  More time should have been devoted to the instruction, IMO.",1371686400,,485,4.5
5670245,5,B00BSTWHBM,"Met simon in spain. he is the real deal. Motogp rider. One of the fastest guys on the plantet.
This video is the real deal.  Nothing complicated. Just straight forward information about everything you need to know to ride safe and fast.",1370736000,,236,4.619047619047619
5670246,5,B00BSTWHBM,"Simon Crafar has a fresh, innovative take on going FASTER on the race track. He's the only motorcycle instructor I've ever heard cover two of my favorite topics: track analysis, starting with the longest straights first, and learning to roll the throttle all the way to the stop! If you just learn to do these two things well, you'll be way ahead of a lot of track day riders and racers. While most motorcycle instructional videos are all about cornering (the slowest part of the ride), this program is about having a blast with acceleration. The problem with this video--if you can call it that--is that many of the skills and techniques just don't apply to normal street riding. Let's face it, if you're red lining your super bike on the street, you're going way too fast! But for racers and track day junkies, this video is wonderfully easy to grasp and apply. You may not realize this from the product description, but this is two videos in one. The first part is the instructional section. The second section is a profile of Crafar as a rider, teacher and father. In the profile, Crafar reveals the one thing he DIDN'T learn from riding on the track and how it cost him dearly on the street. I'm not saying you can't apply these lessons to be a better, faster street rider. Simon's approach to throttle control in the corners is very smart. I'm just saying that the focus of this video is on track riding. Street riders will need to distill it down to make it work for them.",1368144000,2,1479,4.522388059701493
5670247,5,B00BSTWHBM,"I've read all the high performance riding books I could find and I can honestly say that Motovudu is the best one ever written. Clear, concise and straight to the point, Simon explains the techniques you need (basic and advanced) to go faster and stay safe on the track. If you take it seriously and apply it, it will change your riding from a seat of the pants adrenaline rush to precise, methodical and fast; it will show you a path to mastering the sport of high performance riding. More importantly it does this without any pointless psychobabble, using clear examples and straightforward language. If you're serious about going faster, you must read this book and watch the DVD.",1364688000,4,683,4.7478991596638656

8573351,4,B00BSTWHBM,"I'm a firm believer that constant training is the safest way to ride a motorcycle. This DVD is 95% geared towards track/ competition riding.  I don't race, I just participate in about 10 track days a year. It sure helps to know some of the techniques used to improve competitiveness but I would have preferred a broader topic. The quality of the instruction is good though.",1411603200,,373,4.651515151515151
8573352,5,B00BSTWHBM,"Radically improved my riding style and timing of braking. Very clear instruction and demonstration on track. Keeps it simple and doesn't overload you with too much information, just exactly what you need to ride fast safely. It gave me the confidence to step my pace up and this season I enjoyed running in a handful of amateur club races. Thanks Si!",1411603200,,350,4.754098360655738
8573353,5,B00BSTWHBM,there is not a better instructional dvd out there. this is worth its money in practice techniques  if you practice them. better than twist of the wrist but in a more advance rider sort of way where as twist in my mind is aimed at people who have no  prior knowledge or practice/ experience. get it  no you cant download this either it is copy protected so don't waste your time. twist of the wrist on the other hand you can watch on youtube or piratebay,1398729600,,453,4.244186046511628
8573354,5,B00BSTWHBM,"I bring this with me and play before going to any track.  Great information that will make you a much smoother, more in control rider, and of course faster rider.  Must have to your collection.",1396224000,,193,4.485714285714286
8573355,5,B00BSTWHBM,"Simon Crafar is an excellent instructor, that will go to the point showing the facts needed to be fast on the track.",1390435200,,116,4.318181818181818
8573356,5,B00BSTWHBM,"I only have the DVD and I can honestly say ""it's awesome"".  To fully appreciate it I have to tell you a short story.  Before my last track day I must have watched the video 5 times or more.  Each time I learned something new about what Simon was saying.  I am an old dude (57), yes that's right; fifty seven!!!!  I go to the track with guys in their 20's, 30's, 40, and so on.  Among my closest friends I was always the second fastest guy among them.  My closest friend was of course the fastest guy.  He was always just a little faster than me every time out...until now!  We have been riding the tracks together for over 10 years and in that time I never beat him.  He rides a 1000cc bike with DOT race tires and I have a 750cc with the latest and greatest street/track tires and I finally beat him two track days in a row.  He doesn't believe it!!!  How am I beating him on a 750 with street tires?  I finally kicked his butt by over a second the first time and a second and a half the last time out.  The best advice in the video is ""made the straights longer and the corners shorter rule"" and ""pin the throttle wide open as quickly as possible and for as long as possible rule""!  I highly recommend this video!",1385769600,,1215,4.067510548523207
8573357,5,B00BSTWHBM,What a great DVD! Full of advice that really helps and explain things to ride safely and to one's ability. Highly recommend.,1383782400,,124,4.681818181818182
