8171225,5,B000MRAAJC,"Wow!  After reading the great reviews on this page, there's nothing left for me to say except I'm happy that Ella is so deservedly appreciated.  I'm a lifelong believer in our spiritual survival and the continued development of our souls on this physical plane.  I feel certain that after a well-earned rest, Ella's eternal spirit and talent will be reincarnated (probably within her own family).  And when a ""new"" and phenomenal young talent appears on the jazz scene...there'll be no doubt in my mind of the true identity of that future new CinderELLA.  I just wonder if she will remember or recognize her work in this past life.  Hopefully not, because it could revive memories that might inhibit her from achieving even greater success.",1522022400,,740,4.92741935483871
8171226,5,B000MRAAJC,"This documentary takes us through the life of the Lady Ella. I find it hard to believe she never considered herself a great singer. But with performances and snippets of performances we find that she is indeed every bit as good as we can imagine. Get this one, you'll be glad you did.",1338249600,5,284,4.377358490566038
8171227,5,B000MRAAJC,"She was known as the First Lady of Song, and was the greatest scat artist to ever lay down a track of bebop. She was, of course, Ella Fitzgerald, and she is remembered and honored in this double-length Biography special.

Hosted by R&B legend Nancy Wilson, this A&E Entertainment tribute highlights Fitzgerald's seven-decade career as one of the greatest and most recognizable voices in jazz. Beginning with her teenage win of the Amateur Night contest at the legendary Apollo Theatre, her alliance with some of the best bands in jazz music, two short marriages, and her passing in June 1996, the audience is treated to a definitive history of this great singer, as well as many memorable tunes that she made famous.

Interviews with some of her best friends in the music industry, such as Dizzy Gillespie, as well as contemporary voices such as Al Jarreau and Abbey Lincoln, illustrate the influence Fitzgerald's gift had on the music industry. The video features live performances, and also focuses on her signature albums, such as the enormously successful ""Songbook"" series.

Much of Fitzgerald's life is touched upon here, but it is a credit to this Biography that, even after 100 minutes the viewer is left wanting more.",1184371200,24,1226,4.970731707317073
