8178638,4,6305371776,"Another great movie starring Lee Yi Min (chessboxing, 7 Grandmasters).  He is an amazing martial artist, and is probably the best at playing the young  budding fighter.  In this great movie he plays a young man caught up in the  middle of a gang war. The begger Gang, and the bright moon gang.  One after  another beggers are being slain, and no one knows why untill the killers  are found out.  After studying for years under the guidance of his blinded  uncle, he learns the Butterfly fist , and also the pebble style.  Great  practice sessions, good lengthy fights, and another drunken master.  See Yi  Min shine in the final contest when he finally meets the man resonsible for  all the carnage?",965088000,,699,4.622950819672131
