8130060,5,B000GAKE0K,"William ""Captain Kirk"" Shatner narrates this documentary look at the history of the Iran Hostage Crisis, from its beginning in 1979, until it's conclusion in 1981, along with the details on how the Canadian Embassy in Tehran assisted with the escape of 6 American Embassy employees, without the Iranians ever discovering where they were hiding.  Scenes of the real hostages are expertly intercut with re-created scenes using actors, where necessary.
