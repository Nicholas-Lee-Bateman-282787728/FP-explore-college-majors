8702766,3,B00TQEIL2U,"This Blu-ray is a re-issue of an earlier DVD concept recorded in 1993. The format is 4:3 and the sound is presented in stereo only. The imaging is pre-HD but this is really only apparent in distance shots of the orchestra. There are some issues to do with the sound that may concern some viewers more than others, bearing in mind the unique nature of the concept and the lack of any alternatives now or likely in the future. The music is played by the BPO conducted by Abbado throughout. Martha Argerich is the pianist in the third section and solo singers and choral contributions are integral to the last two sections.

The sub-title of this disc is Musical Variations on a Theme, the theme being the story and considerations of the mythical character of Prometheus. This is seen through the music of four very disparate composers and is accompanied by visuals that bland together elements of Fantasia and orchestral concert staging. The story and considerations are described in the booklet and are also identified by use of subtitles whenever there is a significant event.

The first section features Beethoven's music for his ballet music for Prometheus. This amounts to four short sections and the imaging relates to Prometheus being the Creator of Man. The imaging largely takes the form of static images of historic artwork both paintings and sculpture. The orchestral shots are presented in sepia which are intercut with the above described imaging. Sonically this is satisfactory with the exception of the final chord which is cut off too abruptly before the sound is able to die away properly.

The second section focuses on the part of the Prometheus legend in which he is caught and bound by Zeus and chained to a rock. His punishment for stealing fire for Man is to be thus chained and nightly to have his liver eaten by an eagle after which it is constantly renewed ready for the nest night's attack. This time the music is that of Liszt's fifth Symphonic Poem entitles Prometheus. The orchestra is this time seen in normal colour and this section features more moving images, many of fiery topics as appropriate to this part of the legend. Musically this is a straightforward delivery of the poem and there are no untoward issues as regards the sound.

The third section is the most extensive at nearly 20 minutes and features a concert performance of Scriabin's Poem of Fire - Prom&eacute;th&eacute;e. This incorporates lighting effect whereby flood lighting is used to light up sections of the orchestra and choir in a range of colours which are supposed to reflect changing musical meanings. The whole section is called `The Bringer of Light' and it is that context that the performers are constantly lit by a changing display of colours - rather like a `son et Lumi&egrave;re' display. The connection of this lighting idea to the music is that it was in this piece that Scriabin attempted to involve other sensory perceptions including a `colour keyboard' designed to link note on the keyboard with coloured lights. The coloured effects of this presentation are presumably intended to approach this concept. The sonic issues of concern here are the tendency for the recording to struggle with containing the louder parts of the score with evidence of some over-loading and distortion at points of high frequency. The recording simply does not have the dynamic range to cope with all the demands made upon it.

The final section, The Eternal Wanderer by Nono, a controversial musical figure during his lifetime as a result of his political and musical ideals and interests, takes the viewer into an abstract world of sounds which are visually conveyed by images of performers and their instruments seen through various means of transformation. This can produce of sort of disembodied visual sensation and is best summarised by the following booklet quotation `In Nono's Prometeo ""it is up to the listener himself to find a way in (and) to continually look for new and individual ways of listening within the landscapes of this work.' There are no audio issues of concern here.

This then is a unique concept and project. The disparity of the four composers will cause difficulties for some listeners who may struggle with the last two sections which clearly inhabit a different intellectual motivational world musically from the first two sections. The sonic limitations mentioned in the third section particularly will be of concern to others. For some it will be inspiring, as it obviously was for Abbado, but for others it will be a journey too far!

The Blu-ray offers an improvement in terms of image and sonic clarity over the previous DVD version although it remains a recording of its time being in 4:3 format and in stereo with some issues as above. It is a one-off presentation and, as such, will have limited appeal but, I would guess, fervent supporters.

An unusual concept blending sound, vision and legend with four contrasting compositions
