3991256,5,B002UJIY66,I would consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.  Great format and production quality.  I have steadily increased the amount of weights I use and get a great workout every time.  This has turned out to be one of my favorite weight workouts.  Really like this instructor  --- am hoping men's health will produce more of these workouts with him.,1278806400,14,355,4.754098360655738
3991257,3,B002UJIY66,"I would consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness and, overall, I felt like I got a good workout with this DVD.  The instructor is great - pleasant voice, not annoying at all.  If anything, it would probably be better if it was a full hour long workout and, yes, had a few other exercises substituted instead of all the push up varieties but it is the body weight routine, after all, so there were no weights incorporated.  That being the case, liked the Strength Training DVD a little better.",1278806400,14,503,4.5054945054945055
3991258,5,B002UJIY66,"Since making the decision to live a healthier lifestyle, almost a year ago I have amassed quite the collection of workout dvds.  Being able to workout at home keeps me on track because it eliminates the excuses that keep me from going to the gym or for a run; no personal training appointments to miss, inclement weather, etc.  After doing this workout just once, I can already tell that this is going to be one of my favorites.  It reminds me of a group fitness program that I participated in earlier this year that gave me fantastic results, both in terms of pounds and inches lost.

The current description of this workout leaves a lot to be desired so here's my attempt at breaking it down:

* Warmup (8 min)
* 2 minute drill: series of 8 cardio moves done for 15 seconds each to elevate your heart rate
* Bodyweight Circuits (5 mins): challenging strength training moves
* Bodyweight 100 (8 mins) different sequences of toning exercises.  For instance, you might do squats, pushups, & mountain climbers, then repeat the sequence before moving on to the next sequence.
* Power of 10 (10 mins):  Just when you think the workout is over (or that you can't go on) the instructor challenges you to do a series of 10 cardio and toning exercises for 30 seconds each.
* Cooldown (11 mins)

Pros:
* The workout left me sweaty.
* I felt it the next day.
* David Jack (the instructor) is really likeable and not overly chatty (when he speaks, it's to explain the exercises or to issue brief encouragement).
* David does the entire workout with you.  I also liked that you could tell that he was pushing himself throughout the workout (I hate it when I feel like the people on the tv are just breezing through a workout... especially when I'm still doing the beginner modification lol).
* As far as modifications, there are beginner, intermediate, and advanced moves for most of the exercises that are done.  So you should be able to get quite a bit of mileage out of this dvd.
* The dvd has a menu so that you can choose to do individual parts of the workout when you're pressed for time.  I can see myself using the drill or Power of 10 to warmup before going out for a run and the Cool-Down after.

Cons:
* There were a couple of times when I found myself wishing that the instructor would count off the reps (especially when doing mat work).
* There were a LOT of pushups in this workout!  Pushups work a lot of muscles at once so I understand why they were there.  I couldn't do any more after a while so I grabbed my dumbbells and did chest raises and chest flys instead of idly waiting for those sections to be over.

Oh, and I should mention that I am a woman... so don't let the ""Men's Health"" in the title scare you away from this excellent workout dvd.",1269302400,98,2756,4.376470588235295

3991267,4,B002UJIY66,This is a good video but again it covers the same type of workout just like in other videos with slight modifications.  Anyone know of a good workout video that uses dumbbells?,1366329600,,176,4.5
3991268,5,B002UJIY66,"I first tried this DVD when a friend offered to loan it to me. Wow, I really got a nice workout. I appreciate that most of the work can be done without any equipment. The students at the school I work at have used it and agree that the workout is hard, but it gets the job done.",1364083200,,278,3.810344827586207

3991273,4,B002UJIY66,"This is a great work out DVD if you can keep up with it. These exercises are NOT for the beginner, they are very advanced and difficult. You will need to already have a great bit of stamina and muscles to even do some of these exercises at all. Personal trainers eat your heart out.",1354060800,6,282,4.1454545454545455
3991274,3,B002UJIY66,This video arrived very timely just as promised.  I've been using it for a few weeks now but I'm still waiting on my belly to flatten. The instructor does say it takes 8 weeks to see some results so I'll wait but so far so good.,1348272000,,228,3.9565217391304346
3991275,3,B002UJIY66,"I like the fast pace and intensity.  I'm 45 and recovering from a chronic infection so this is challenging for me.  It offers a good alternative on days when it is difficult going to the gym to lift weights.  However, I was injured doing one of the exercises.

The emphasis on pushups--about 4-5 types--is a big issue.  It puts a lot of strain on the shoulders.  I hurt my right should the first day of doing this doing the shoulder raise pushups.  It popped.  I would give it five stars apart from this.  I continue using the tapes but do rehab exercises during the push-up segments.

I like the lower body and ""core"" exercises.  Some put a bit much pressure on the lower back--not sure Stuart McGill would approve--but no issues so far with the moves.

So 5 stars for intensity, leg, back, and abs.  1 star for shoulders and pushups.",1346544000,6,835,4.450331125827814
3991276,5,B002UJIY66,"The Men's Health Belly Off! Workout - The Body Weight Routine, is a very transportable workout routine.  As long as you have 48 minutes, a DVD Player and a place about 6' by 6' (hopefully with a mat but not totally needed), you can perform this workout.  I have used it at home and on the road.  Let's face it, hotel gyms are usually not the best.  And who wants to only use a beat-up treadmill or stationary bike (and nothing else) while you are traveling?  The workout hits shoulders, triceps, core and legs.  With any body-weight workout, there will be push-ups and this DVD is no exception.  However, the DVD has a wide variety of exercises.  The DVD leader does not waste time. He starts to explain the next exercises with little pause between sets.  What is expected of the participant is pretty clear with harder and easier variations demonstrated during the exercises.  The warm-up and the cool-down (stretch) portions are very good.  This can be played straight through or in segments. I would strongly recommend this DVD. I am an over-the-hill type who is fighting to stay fit (get fitter) against many of the same constraints we all experience.",1334275200,7,1155,4.696517412935323
3991277,5,B002UJIY66,"This is a GREAT DVD! The work outs are straight forward. The music isn't cheesy. I complement it with the Belly Off Diet Book, and it's one of the plans that has helped me lose weight. I don't know how affective it would be though, without the Belly Off Diet Book to accompany it.",1331596800,,280,4.203703703703703
3991278,4,B002UJIY66,"I've been doing the workout a few times a week for about a month now, and it's pretty good.  It works both the upper and lower body and gives you a chance to start out slow if you're out of shape and challenge yourself more as you practice.  My only real complaint is that it places the abdominals section at the very end of the video as a ""bonus"" section.  It's kind of dumb because it comes after the cooldown, so you have to skip the cooldown section and then go back if you want to incorporate it into the rest of the routine.  Other than that, this DVD is pretty good for someone who is just getting back into shape.",1329350400,7,621,4.107438016528926
3991279,3,B002UJIY66,"I don't have much to say as John Paul L. Finan said it very well.  I wish there was a timer and a counter.  It's a cheap DVD with a good, fast paced, workout.  In general, you will be happy.

I do have a HUGE complaint though.  The DVD very prominently advertises, ""no equipment needed"", but as soon as you get to the first circuit, it requires a bench to elevate your feet for the WHOLE circuit!  Now, I know what you're thinking, just use something else...the problem is, I don't have anything else to use.  My chairs are bar height, there is no couch in the room, etc., and they act like everyone just has a bench laying around.  They don't even suggest an alternative.

Totally false advertising.

I'm sure I will get some criticism for this, but bottom line to me, ""no equipment needed"" means NO equipment needed.",1326326400,47,818,4.3933333333333335
3991280,3,B002UJIY66,"This is an OK workout, but it's not very motivating, not good for people in decent shape who want to improve, and not very well designed to help you follow along.

Pros: It works a wide variety of areas, and it has a lot of strength training mixed in. It tires me out, and if you do it often in addition to sports or other training, it ought to help you stay in good shape.

Cons: There's not nearly enough stretching for me. I work in a cubicle so I always have to pause and do more stretching, especially of the neck and hamstrings. The speed on some of the exercises is unhelpful for non athletes. They pound through 12 T-push ups in 27 seconds, for example (that's where you stretch your chest and reach one arm up vertically  between each rep. That's too fast for all but the smoothest and most coordinated users. I do this video every other week (mixed w a ton of others) because I can't stand doing the same workout every time, but after a year, I still can't keep pace while maintaining decent form. I can slow the video down (I use 92% speed with VLC player) and that is helpful.

The functional problems have to do with the lack of a progress bar along the bottom as well as any indication of target reps beyond a two second flash at the start of an exercise. The trainer doesn't give you much hint as to where you are in each section, either, so I'm often guessing how much effort to apply until the guy says ""OK, two more"". Even if you glance up at the right second to catch their suggested rep target, it's too small to read unless you have a giant TV. I like to know where I am so I can give maximum effort at the right time.

Overall, I don't mean to tear it apart. It's a solid video and the trainer guy is perfectly likable. It's just not p90x-grade.",1323216000,6,1767,4.185294117647059
3991281,5,B002UJIY66,"Simply one of the best workout DVDs I've seen.  At an intermediate level it enables me to get my heart rate up with a good sweat while working all the major areas.

A special note for those with back problems.  I have two herniated disks so I have to be extra cautious as to what I attempt.  I started off slow and cautious and have inserted the ""Cobra"" yoga posture at the end of each set.  For me this modification has worked out very well.  I have been able to move from 5 to 10 to 15 lb with no problems and will be moving to 20 lb on each dumbbell next week.

I started in March and it is now October of the same year so I think this 8 month span of interest shows that this DVD is still enjoyable to follow and doesn't drive a person batty.",1317945600,7,746,3.933333333333333
3991282,4,B002UJIY66,"The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that I would have liked to receive a spreadsheet to keep a log of my workouts & the DVD does not coincide with the book. Otherwise, the web support of the program is pretty good.  They appear to make the efforts to improve the website ($ subscription).  This is a good book that gives you a diet to work with and a workout program that you can do in your garage with a good set of dumbbells.",1315785600,2,441,3.943820224719101
3991283,5,B002UJIY66,"Nice quick workout, good instructions and good form, with emphasis on safe performance of exercises.

3991284,5,B002UJIY66,"I've had this dvd for a couple of months now and it still makes me sweat.  I have always been active and work out 6 days a week.  Most of my workouts consist of Crunch or Exercise TV dvds.  This workout is definitely on par if not better than those workouts.  Having three different people in the video to give you options is such a plus since most dvds only give you one option for modification.  While this video doesn't have weights, my body definitely gets slammed from all the push ups done.  It does come flying at you during sections with many exercises but it helps to keep off the boredom.",1300579200,5,598,4.294642857142857
3991285,5,B002UJIY66,"this workout is really good.  i usually run it twice and skip certain parts, but it has helped me in my weight loss.  actually, it helped me gain more muscle, than lose weight.  i usually listen to some good music, throw this on, and work my ass off.  the biggest problem is doing it everyday.",1299456000,5,293,4.2727272727272725
3991286,5,B002UJIY66,"This is an intense workout that is good for building a lean muscular body with a flat stomach and gaining strength. However, if you are after building muscle mass to get big, then this DVD is not for you. But if you want a lean, ripped body, it will help you achieve your goals if you follow it through.",1292976000,18,303,4.1525423728813555
3991287,5,B002UJIY66,"I really like this DVD.  It's not too fast paced or exhausting, yet if you're doing it right, you will be out of breath getting a good workout.  I just did it yesterday and I'm definitely feeling it in my chest, shoulders, back and abs.

The DVD consists of a warmup followed by a cardio segment, then 2 supersets, which are 2-3 combination strength exercises which you repeat 3 times.  This is followed by a ""strength circuit,"" which is a quicker series of moves, and of course there's a cooldown and stretch.  At the end, there's a separate abs section.

I think it's pretty good as a well-rounded strength training DVD.  It hits all the major muscle groups - chest and triceps (with lots of pushups), shoulders (shoulder press), back (bentover row), core, biceps (curls), quads (lots of squats), and hamstrings (deadlifts).  They're all combination exercises, which I are supposed to be better than simple isolation exercises.

The look/feel of the DVD is also really nice.  The presenter is this guy who reminds me of a really positive football coach, and there's a chick there for some reason who demonstrates lower-intensity versions of the moves.  The music is a nice upbeat pop rock mix which gives it a good feel.

Only negative I can come up with is that the guy really doesn't tell you how much weight to use, but I guess it's pretty self-explanatory (as much as you can handle and still do the routine).

Overall, definitely part of my strength training rotation.  It's a bit tough to find strength DVDs that are tailored to men, but this one fits the bill just right.",1289260800,28,1580,4.677536231884058
