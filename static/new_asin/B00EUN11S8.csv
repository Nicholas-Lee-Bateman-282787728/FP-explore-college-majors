8609583,5,B00EUN11S8,"I waited when the CD about this same topic first came out some years ago, for not being European, I sorely required more background knowledge of this topic and the music.
As if reading my mind, DG released last year this terrific footage with real persons being interviewed, followed by a recital.
In this wonderful footage we also have musicians (composers and performers) speaking on this very important topic. One really wish there can be a similar footage on not just music, but also on, say, paintings and art.
Artistic gems buried during one of the darkest ages in human history, and its uncovering is always full of marvel, regrets and deep pathos. Yet at the same time, the human spirit shines through, and the joy of music making even in the most dire circumstances burst through like a ray of white light amid darkness of the human soul.
This is a very uplifting footage that i would unreseveredly recommend to just any one.",1397433600,4,934,4.701219512195122
