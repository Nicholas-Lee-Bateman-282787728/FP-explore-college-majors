8090351,4,B000BP5RPM,I bought this to show my sons why Walter Payton was great and it did the job!  I only gave it 4 stars due to the quality of the video (kind of like someone recorded it off t.v. in the 90's) and the printing of the liner (it looks like it was printed on an old inkjet printer).,1388966400,,276,3.7586206896551726
8090352,4,B000BP5RPM,"I'm 73 and have never seen a runner like Walter Peyton before or since. I wished the tape was twice as long and that Walter had been able to play twice as long, what a fantastic athlete.",1362614400,,186,4.054054054054054
8090353,5,B000BP5RPM,This was a great DVD of Walter Payton. I have shared this DVD with the next generation and they were amazed with how he ran with the ball.,1323648000,,138,3.9642857142857144
8090354,5,B000BP5RPM,"This is a great example of Walter Paytons running, power and balance, combined with his ability to run at the tackler and knock them off their balance.
a true champion, with excellent comments by walter how to play like a champion.
 i hope to benefit by using it in australia to demonstrate to myself how an afl player should approach sport mentaly to end up a winner like him.",1305504000,,377,4.463768115942029
