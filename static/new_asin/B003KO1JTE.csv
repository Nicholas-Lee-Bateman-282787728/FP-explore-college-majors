8398826,3,B003KO1JTE,"First of all, take into account this is not an instructional DVD. I'm sure some fellow guitar players have mistaken it. If you're looking for Matt's signature licks or stuff like this, you'll be hugely disappointed. It's more like an in-depth interview with the man about influences, tone, soloing approach... Having said that, you can get some useful advices, for sure, but they're not about technique or anything like that. Actually, Matt stresses that it's not about the notes, but about the feeling... In my opinion, the full band performances are the best in this DVD. A good purchase, but you'd better know what you will get for your money!",1523232000,,646,4.881818181818182

8398828,4,B003KO1JTE,"There are no demos of Matt's licks here, but some ideas about soloing that were very usefyl. I knew what it offered before purchase so I was happy. I would have liked more on his scales or shapes that he uses, and when to apply major scale ideas when initially performing in minor pentatonic songs. Overall I enjoyed the DVD.",1373155200,,325,4.433333333333334
8398829,5,B003KO1JTE,"I think this DVD is awesome. I strongly recomend it.  Matt tells you everything he's doing. Thanks to this DVD I can see he plays a lot of Major pentatonic and Mixolydian.  Once I started doing this, my playing doesn't sound boring any more.  If you own a lot of guitar DVD's, chord books, scale books, etc and you're still having trouble, this could be your problem.  YOU'RE NOT LISTENING!  You should know at any given moment during the song what chord is being played.  This means you have to use both ears.  Use one ear to listen to what chord is being played during your solo and the other ear to listen to what you are playing over each one of those chords.  For example (blues in A) you're rippin the Am pentatonic scale with no clue. There goes the 5 chord there goes the 4 chord and you're still rippin the Am pent. Pretty soon you're playing some pretty boring stuff.  Try this.  When it comes back to the 1 chord play A major pentatonic over that chord like Matt does on occasion.  When it comes to the 4 chord then play A minor pentatonic but center it around the D note.  Or play a little bit of, as Matt says, D Mixolydian or D major pentatonic. Then when the 5 chord comes around like on the song Lights are on but nobody's home 5:04 to 5:08 into the song Matt plays a really nice thing using straight up G minor pent over that 5 chord. Sweet! That song is in C by the way. You can use E minor pentatonic in my example over the 5 chord. E major pentatonic sounds good also.  Next time you hear someone play something cool ask yourself what chord was he playing over at that moment of coolness, and that will tell you alot about the scale he was playing. now go back and listen to Matt's songs and ask your self what chord was being played at each moment of coolness, and think about the scales he talked about on the DVD, and soon you will be playing some pretty cool stuff. This is 10 stars in my collection! Thanks Matt!!! Now stop rippin' and start listening!!!",1351468800,2,1979,4.2175066312997345
8398830,5,B003KO1JTE,"While I highly recommend this DVD, the buyer should be aware that it is not a quick lesson on how to copy his guitar licks. Instead, think of this as multiple guitar lessons on how to become a better player. Beginners will not gain as much from it as the intermediate to advanced player. This is not due to technical content. It's more related to having enough playing/practice time under your fingers that you can pick up on what he's saying and demonstrating. If you are hoping to find some shortcut to playing the blues or just want to copy Matt's licks from tab, this DVD is not for you. If you are interested in developing your blues playing to let your own voice come through, then this DVD will give you tips and approaches that will enliven your playing. As Matt discusses and demonstrates, there are simple things you can do with your physical approach to playing (picking, slides, bends, etc.) and note choices that can help your playing come alive.",1315267200,4,959,4.5813953488372094
8398831,4,B003KO1JTE,"I just received my DVD and couldn't wait to check it out.  I'm a big fan.  I had read the reviews on line noting that this wasn't a typical how to video so I was a bit worried about it.

As Matt says in the DVD there are many other instructional videos and books out there.  Lord knows I've got many of them and they just sit on the shelf.  This DVD provides insight into how to become your own player and find your own voice rather than learning some of Matt's licks.  He describes some of his goals when playing and how he puts it all together.

I think it will take a few viewings to really impact my playing but I'm sure it will.  I do wish there was more specific how-to segments to help apply some of the concepts and that's the reason for the 4 star vs. 5 star rating.

I'd recommend this DVD for anyone that doesn't want to sound like everyone else.  I'd also recommend seeing Matt play live.  It's a real treat.",1287100800,3,920,4.083798882681564
8398832,2,B003KO1JTE,"I wonder how many of these they would sell if it was described as a ""philosophical-interview DVD"" rather than a ""guitar instructional"" one? Matt is a damn fine player, but he teaches precious little. Lots of talk, not much to say. More of an interview/performance piece...IF i had known this, I would have never bought it. Robben Ford and Larry Carlton, for example are players Matt clearly is influenced by...the difference is they can actually teach. And Ford's and Carlton's instructional videos are prime examples of how it should be done. They can articulate AND demonstrate ""how they do it."" Matt cannot, or chooses not to do this. If you want to watch him play, and spend about 4 minutes out of an hour actually showing (poorly I might add) inversions of an A7 chord,then be my guest. Otherwise you would glean more from just stealing his licks off his recordings cuz he aint showing you. BTW No tab/no notation of any kind. They don't even bother to notate ANY of the performances. And for 28 bucks, you should get more. Get the Greg Koch, SRV,Blues or Guitar Gristle DVD's,Albert Collins REH DVD and or Larry Carlton 1 DVD, or BB King Bluesmaster DVD instead. Too bad, cuz Matt is a GREAT player.",1283990400,13,1205,4.661971830985915
8398833,5,B003KO1JTE,"If you are looking for a note-for-note ""licks"" lesson, then don't bother with this video. However, if you are a fan of Modern Blues, Matt Schofield, or blues in general, and you would like to hear Matt's perspective on the art of playing the blues, then by all means, get this video today. Matt is without a doubt one of the best players out there today, drawing from old school (BB King, Albert Collins, etc) as well as the new school (Eric Johnson, Robben Ford etc). For 71 minutes, you will hang on every word he utters, much like I did. You WILL see him play (alone and with his band) and from this, learn what notes, scales, ornaments, etc. he uses, thus affording you the chance to ""cop some licks."" But the general format seems to be more in line with Hal Leonard's recent Artist Lessons (i.e. Joe Bonamassa, Eric Johnson) in the fact that he shares more about his influence, approach, philosophy, etc., moreso than showing you the money-note licks we all love to hear and want to steal.",1283299200,3,994,4.497237569060774
