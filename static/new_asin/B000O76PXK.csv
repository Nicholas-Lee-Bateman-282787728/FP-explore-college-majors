2791213,4,B000O76PXK,"This is a very moving, and at times disturbing, film.  But throughout, it is thought provoking, providing valuable insight into the feelings of despair and helplessness that can lead to suicide.  The scenes of actual suicides are relatively few, but they are extremely powerful and almost impossible to forget.  Even more riveting, however, are the stories that are told by and about the victims and their families.  In a tender way, the film depicts another side of suicide: the helplessness that many friends and family members feel in trying to stop those who are drawn to suicide and The Bridge.",1181174400,7,599,4.96
2791214,4,B000O76PXK,"Where does one start in trying to describe this film? A film about real people jumping to their deaths from the Golden Gate Bridge. Harrowing. Disturbing. It shows us the sometimes fragile wall between despair/depression and suicide. For some of us the wall might be sturdier than for others, but who knows what forces of nature and turns of life can push any of us toward the bridge, given the right (wrong) circumstances?

And though many of the people in the film gave warning signs aplenty, some did not. It makes one wonder about our friends, our families. Ourselves. How much of what we see is surface cheerfulness and what really goes on beneath that surface? Most of us tend to put on happy faces for people, but what's under that happy face?

I remember a friend of my parents who committed suicide when I was a kid. As far as I could see she was a happy, healthy woman with a good husband and two good kids. Every once in a while I still think about her and why she did it, why she left two young daughters motherless. I don't know the answer, but I think this movie helps me get a little closer to it.

I want to say I liked this film, but it's hard to use that word for a movie like this. It is like slowing down to watch an accident on the freeway. We might have a compulsion to watch, but are repelled and maybe feel a little guilty at the same time. But maybe watching a movie like this will make us more perceptive to those in our lives, help us take them more seriously and try to do more to help them. Though as the movie shows, even all of that doesn't help all the time.

Definitely worth watching, but not for the faint of heart.",1180569600,8,1650,4.228571428571429

 Sure sure, you haveta sit through the psychobabble. Pretending this art-school film is given gravitas by the fog and crying family isn't an easy task when you just want the hopping to commence.

2791216,4,B000O76PXK,"I spotted this film by randomly surfing my channel guide on Sat TV and watched it on IFC May 8. The program description actually left me in a state of disbelief; there's no way they could do an entire documentary on suicidal plunges from this bridge, can they? They sure did. It's an amazing piece of journalism into what others have already described as taboo in normal journalism. The comments from the families and friends of the jumpers weave the story together incredibly. The documentary was inspired by a New Yorker magazine article called ""Jumpers"" about the same subject matter. The Golden Gate Bridge has more suicides at that one location than any other place on earth. Morbid at times as others described here, but relentlessly compelling as we watch the film progess and try to figure out why in the hell this bridge has a strange and fatal attraction for those who are so mentally disturbed, they'll hurl themselves over to a watery death. Incredibly, one attempt is thwarted by a tourist taking pictures that is captured on film. And one jumper who actually survived (his jump was not caught on film) tells what it's like to fall from such a staggering height into the bay. He describes how when he let go of the rail of the bridge, he immediately regretted his decision to jump and as he fell he readjusted his body hoping to have the least impact when he hit the water in the hopes of somehow surviving, which he did. But the fatal leaps interspliced with real life perspectives from those who knew the jumpers are in fact strangely fascinating. Fascinating mostly because the local and national media normally just don't care to report suicides with justified reasons. It's a glimpse into an area that is largely ignored, yet intriguing to look at because it is so rare to hear from the associates of those who choose to end their own lives. And some of the footage of the leaps, we really haven't seen such gripping, horrifying and again, morbidly compelling footage since the dark days of Sept. 11, 2001, when victims of the terrorist attacks in the Twin Towers jumped to their deaths for obviously different reasons.",1178668800,81,2137,4.7319034852546915
2791217,5,B000O76PXK,"Well despite ""Karen Al-hakim ""Stevo09845""'s apparent iron-clad grasp on the true motivations of people with mental illness and living in crisis situations...  -I mean really, how could any of us be so stupid as to think these people had anything more going on with them other than they didn't get invited to enough parties- this is a very insightful film on a subject that is a minefield of conflicts, sadness and contradictions.

Without any judgments this film allows you to see the war that not only rages within those who have reached a point inside themselves where they feel the only peace they can achieve is through dying.  But also those who share their life with them when they know what their friend or family member is suffering through and not being able to help or save them.

I knew about this film when it was being made and I had a lot of questions about the project and how, or even if it's vision could be realized in the end product.  All I can express is complete admiration in the efforts and results those obviously heartfelt efforts produced.",1178582400,3,1066,4.619047619047619
2791218,3,B000O76PXK,"It's hard to take the actions of some of these individuals--although I should stress not all of them--too seriously. Many of them apparently seem as if their own real ""struggle,"" is some sort of social desire--whatever it may be--and that their suicide attempt just so happened to take place at the Golden Gate Bridge strongly supports this opinion. Many of the individuals performed these actions as a last-minute plea for attention, but unfortunately, there are plenty of other individuals in this world who see far, far greater amounts of struggle, struggles far greater than the realm of ""not being the center of attention.""

The bridge was well-crafted, but my sympathies lie elsewhere.",1177286400,3,691,5.169642857142857
2791219,5,B000O76PXK,"Within minutes into watching ""The Bridge"" you begin to feel the intensity of what this film is about. For me, at the beginning of the film, there is a comparison made between ""a celebration of life"" (a wind surfer riding the waves beneath the Golden Gates, celebrating one of the most beautiful places on the face of our earth) and someone above feeling the exact opposite and acting upon their own set of feelings. The opening of this film took me be surprise despite knowing what the film was about when it started.

The Bridge is about ""place"". How can ONE place be chosen so often for an activity such as suicide?

The Bridge is about 'time'. How can ONE place be chosen time and time again to 'end time'?

The Bridge is about ""decision"". Seeing people... really seeing people, make and commit to a decision to end their lives has a chilling effect for sure. And while going to the bridge may be a decision in and of itself, that final moment, that moment that is less than a split second in length, is a moment of self-decision unlike any other. It is, well... so final and SO impacting.

The Bridge is about ""people"". It is about the people who elect to end their lives at the bridge. It is about the people they leave behind, and it is about the people who see them in their final moment, the people who just happen to be there. And, so, in some way, The Bridge is about ""chance"" as well.

The Bridge is not like any other film I have ever seen. It is one of a kind. It is powerful in a way no other film could be. It is true, and its impact is lasting. The imagery emblazoned itself upon me and is cause to think, stop, listen, pay attention to and attempt to understand human existence, glory, sadness, pain, suffering, and most of all decision.

It is not a film for everyone, yet everyone should take the time to see it.",1177286400,25,1831,4.308139534883721
2791220,4,B000O76PXK,"Please be aware what you are ordering - a documentary that shows, at times in closeups, real people jumping to their deaths off of the Golden Gate Bridge.  That being said, I saw this film at the Tribeca Film Festival and was talking about it for months.  I am going to buy the dvd, and though the movie is not happy it does put a face on suffering that is compelling to watch.  In an interview after the Tribeca screening, the director said that he was interested by this subject after watching people jump from the towers on 9/11.  He said that they were jumping to avoid the fire inside the building, and those that leap from the Golden Gate jump to avoid the fire inside themselves.  It really changes how you view life and death - I highly recommend (though the subject matter is not for everyone).  It is not gory, you just see the splashes, but you see people's last moments on earth.  You will be talking about it with those you love.",1175558400,20,942,4.348571428571429

2791240,2,B000O76PXK,"Long, drawn out excuse for showing film footage of people committing suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. The film fails to adequately delve into the motivations and backgrounds of the jumpers and the interviews of family and friends are unfocused. Moreover, the film makers took the unethical approach of sticking a camera into the face of those subjects without telling them they had film of the actual jump.

The pacing is slow and disjointed. You get a shot of a person walking back and forth on the bridge. Then interminable and banal commentary from those that knew them spliced into repeated shots of the person preparing their jump. Switch topics to another subject, repeat, back to the first subject, repeat, add a third person, etc. By the mid point of the film, you are screaming ""Jump!!!' just to get it over with.

This could have been a thoughtful and illuminating documentary, but it just comes off as prurient and exploitative. It is perhaps a more polished version of those 1980s ""Faces of Death"" flicks that purported to be a serious investigation into mortality, but were just excuses to show unedited footage of accident victims.",1499731200,,1159,4.908163265306122

2791253,5,B000O76PXK,"This documentary takes an unsentimental, objective view about suicides, focusing particularly on those which occur in the waters under the Golden Gate Bridge.  Indeed, several suicides are filmed as they are committed.  Sandwiched in between these harsh, discomfiting visuals are the stories of those who could not be saved.  It's likely that those loved ones of the suicides were willing to talk on film because they have come to terms, in many cases, with the death; so, those left behind who are still angry, ashamed, resentful - those who have not gone through the grieving process in its entirety - are not represented here which skews the documentary a bit.  But you can't force people to talk.  What's striking about these suicides is the diversity of their lifestyles.  Some were seemingly ""born this way"", harboring for too long mental illnesses that would not give them any peace.  Others were experiencing significant downturns in their lives and found themselves looking at all with the horrible tunnel vision depression so gracelessly provides.  In any case, whatever the cause of their despair, the viewer is made to feel the fog around this subject.  Those left behind often gaze at the camera or at some fixed object in the distance with that familiar survivor's guilt.  It's odd but there's some grace in their sorrow.
There are professionals and lay folk alike who believe objective discussions about suicide as an issue makes people more likely to do it.  Obviously, a documentary showing actual suicides would fall prey to this criticism.  I tend to see it like this: suicide is a direct challenge to our survival instinct so most people never even think about it.  But when people are caught up in the darkest depressions, the deepest psychoses, the most threatening anxieties, the will to live is jeopardized and the idea of suicide suddenly gains momentum.  So I don't believe discussing suicide causes it.  I believe people who are suicidal seek out discussions on suicide as a way to get information on how to do it and as a way to find intervention.  After that, if no one intervenes, they take the last measure.
I applaud the documentary for addressing a mental health issue that is as old as our species.  Being silent about it, dressing it up as some religious issue, only makes matters worse.  Though most of the cases presented did end their lives, others who found intervention often at the last second survived not only their attempt but their recovery.",1494201600,4,2486,4.920863309352518

2791268,4,B000O76PXK,"This is not a film for everyone, think real hard before purchasing.  As a person who lives with mental illness, living isolated with little to no family support, of having a family member mentally ill, and being shunned by other relatives I've known for my entire life I can relate to these people that jumped.  I remember one woman Carol Pressely  Gene Spragues friend had said she didn't know why he didn't want to live.  Well when you think about it it's pretty much like this people love to judge, shame, humiliate, there is no kind of kindness in this society and there is only so much one can take.  Some of the people interviewed I felt really needed to study mental illness more thoroughly.  Because I felt that a few of the comments made in the film by the persons interviewed were way off base especially by the couple that were Gene Sprague's friends.  The woman of the couple was like ""If he only tried harder""  OMG  message to that woman get yourself to a NAMI meeting.  You can't turn this illness on & off.  Or go ""Hey I need to try harder, I can do it""!  All in all this was a eye opening documentary but for me this is only because I RELATED to the subject matter, I've been in & out of hospitals my adult life & I'm finally on the right medication after years of failed attempts.
Use your discretion when watching cause there are a few disturbing scenes, some sad moments, but a beautiful backdrop of the San Francisco bridge & bay.  One final note everyone if or when you get this DVD there is one scene in the documentary where it shows a rainbow.

Like slowing down to look at an accident on the freeway, which people do every day, and think nothing of. No one wants to be reminded of how fragile we all are, of how closely life and death are intertwined, and the reality of death is not something we want to think about. Nor is the despair that some people suffer and can't seem to find their way out of. This film was particularly meaningful for me because the brother of one of my closest friends jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge back in the 90s. Like the families profiled in the film, their family was forever changed, and they were left with deep feelings of guilt and regret. This is a hard film to watch, but I'm glad I did.

Now either its a magical bridge that only kills you if you sincerely want to die, or theres a lot of people who jumped, changed their mind, but died.

Yes everyone has the right to choose if they want to live, but even just one person regretting their decision the moment they jump and still dying is one too many. Some of these people couldve have gone on to be happy if they just had someone reach out to them in their moment of need.

2791337,4,B000O76PXK,"I only gave it 4 stars, because how can you give it five with this subject matter? If I did give it 5 stars it would be for one of the saddest things I've seen, but it's a necessary film. It made that point loud and clear. I've fought depression my entire life, suicide became my shield against the hurt and pain I'd gone through since childhood. I'd rationalize my failures and disappointments by convincing myself that I could always kill myself and end my suffering. Although, I could never do it the way they did, but I can understand how they could. I chose the peaceful way - prescription drugs, which almost got me where I wanted to be on one occasion. It was a miracle I survived. Instead of making me afraid of it, I came away with such a peacefulness I'd never known before and it, to this day, made me completely unafraid of death. There is someone waiting for us and there is forgiveness for what we do to ourselves. I felt no retribution while I was there, just acceptance and love. I was stopped and told it wasn't my time. I came back into my body again and wished I hadn't. I'm not condoning suicide, not by any means. I'm not telling anyone to take their life, because you will miss the true reason you're here and there is always a reason.
Five years later I would find out why I was saved. If I had died then, at 21, I would have never known my son. He is my greatest gift and he made my life a real life. He has been the only thing that saved me from myself and keeps me alive. Every day I thank God for him, even on the most challenging of days. He, like myself, has struggled with his own depression and painful past. There are so many of us that do, but to give up and never give yourself a real chance to live, a chance to change what you've created for yourself, that's the saddest part of suicide.
Please, take another day to think it through and try to find something to keep you going. Anything that won't add to your spiraling down, because you are worth the trouble. You are not the problem, you are the solution. Life will never be everything you want it to be, or even imagine. We don't know what's in the future for any of us. Believe me, there will be something that you wished you hadn't missed. Some thing, some time, that will make what you're thinking right now a terrible mistake.",1468022400,5,2319,4.237020316027088

.It is very surreal as you watch the actual footage of these people jumping to their death set to the sounds of music and friends and family telling their stories. I think the thing that stood out to me the most was the fact that although they all ultimately chose to end their loves in exactly the same spot, their stories could't have been more different. One thing they all shared in common was the fact that they were loved. These weren't hopeless street people. These people were loved, and they knew they were loved, which begs the impossible question, Why? For me the take away from this film is the stark reminder that life is fragile and no one is immune.

2791461,5,B000O76PXK,"Over the course of this documentary you will meet family and friends of people who have died by suicide.  They run the gamut in their reactions to suicide.  Some blame themselves, some blame the one who has died for being (in their opinion) weak and selfish and some are at a total loss as to understand what in the world happened.  Some are in deep denial.  The fact of the matter is, suicide is almost always the result of some form of a real medical illness called depression.  It can be attached to someone with bi-polar disorder.  It can also be tied to a person who is terminally ill or someone who has lost all hope for relief from a life situation, or situations, that cause them deep and dreadful pain. It is not the result of a character defect or an act of selfishness.  Without exception, every person I've ever met who survived an attempt have said they didn't want to die, they only needed the pain to stop.

I found the film to be respectful of both the jumpers and the ones left behind.  Some call those left behind, Survivors.  I find this inaccurate and somewhat disrespectful of those who have died.  I feel they/we are more like the collateral damaged.  I have lost loved ones to suicide, so I speak from my heart about how I feel.

The film makes no judgmental statements of those on either side of this tragedy.  It only puts it all out there and leaves the viewer to decide what they may or may not have learned.  It's not like watching a documentary on, say, the horror of the Holocaust or the massacre at Columbine High School.  Death by suicide (unless it's a suicide bomber) is an intimate and personal thing because it takes root in the mind of an individual human being.  For me, the most compelling stories were those of the first jumper, Lisa (whose family is in deep denial), Kevin Hines (who survived), the man called Ruby by his friends (I identify with him), and, of course, Gene Sprague, whose story runs through the entire narrative of the film and provides the final climax.  In all of these cases, so different from each other in their circumstances and final journey to the Bridge, the signs and foreshadowing of suicide were there for all to see.  In some cases, there were concerted attempts to avert suicide.  But in two particular cases, Ruby and Gene, it was a deep loneliness and absence of love in their lives, that finally made it too hard and too painful to live.

The Golden Gate Bridge is the most frequently used public venue for suicide.  I think it's a desperate cry of pain from someone who has dwelt in a private hell for a long time.  Only the Sea of Trees, the dense forest in Japan, comes close to the same amount of suicides.  The Bridge is easy to get to, no need to stockpile pills or buy a gun.  People travel from all over the world to die there.  I think that says a great deal about the state of mental health across the globe.  Teen suicide gets a great deal of press.  But in actuality, the demographic most at risk for suicide are men over the age of 50.  We live in a youth obsessed culture.  Older men are no longer useful or valued.

A suicide barrier is being funded and will be erected in the near future.  Mental health professionals have finally convinced the bureaucrats that statistics show once a person has decided on a method for suicide, only that method will do. The argument was ""why spend all of this money?  If someone is determined to kill them self, they'll just shoot or hang themselves if we take away the GGB""  If someone is prevented from jumping, it is a rare occurrence for them to die by another method.  People think jumping is a quick 4-7 seconds and it's over, painless and quick.  Wrong.  Death occurs fairly quickly (within a few minutes) but is far from painless.  Think of it this way, you hit the water at the speed of a downhill racer.  The body stops falling after a few feet, but the internal organs do not.  The internal physical damage is intense.  You drown and succumb to hypothermia.  It is not an easy death.

If you, or a loved one, are impacted by suicide, this film can help you understand some things and it just might help save a life or two.",1444089600,8,4159,4.402887139107611

Death is part of life. Yet discussing suicidal death  seems tabu, the stigma so great,  we just can't...  Perhaps out of our own fear / guilt at being one of those who didn't have time for compassion somewhere along the way,  in someone's darkest hour? ""The Bridge""  illuminated,  for me,  the fact that,  while carrying a sadness,  an illness, a constant struggle within themselves, (common threads)  that can hardly define people who end their lives.  We see they had known love,  were talented,  had friends who genuinely cared... All the more devastating to see the ripple out from them,  to all the people affected,  forever heartbroken,  forever asking questions,  getting no answers.

The FACES OF DEATH films went from a cult fan base to being watched by tons of people in the early days of video and are still sought out by many. When people drive by the scene of an accident they still slow down and glimpse to see if there were any fatalities. The reality is that were not the sick people that some would have us believe but there is a morbid curiosity with death and all things that surround it. Perhaps its just our way of looking and then being thankful that it wasn't us.

But there are times when its a good thing to see life and the end of it as it really is. There are times when it can help us to understand things that happen that cause death. Such is the case with THE BRIDGE. Filmed over and entire year this movie captures the beauty and the sadness that is found in the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco. A monument to engineering the bridge was an accomplishment not just of its time but of the achievement that formed this structure. And yet it has taken on a new life as one of the most used locations for people to commit suicide. Thats what this film is about.

With a combination of filmed footage of people actually jumping from the bridge melded with interviews with their friends and family members, the movie attempts to decipher what it was that led these people to make the decision to take their own lives. The most universal reason seems to be mental health issues ranging from paranoid schizophrenia to depression. That mixing of watching a person walking across the bridge, making the effort to climb over the rail and then to actually jump with the words and faces of their loved ones left behind shakes you to your core.

The movie also includes an interview with Kevin Hines, one of those who jumped and yet survived. He realizes the things he thought he couldn't change were actually doable but he didn't come to that realization until after he jumped. Changing his mind in midair he altered his position, landed in the water and though injured was able to swim nearly 50 feet to the surface. In a twist of fate a sea lion swam around him and kept him afloat until help could reach him. He says he will go to his grave thinking that this was God stepping in. I tend to agree.

Those responsible for the making of the film were not just sitting idly by while people jumped. When they could tell someone was about to do so they contacted the bridge authorities to help stop them. But recognizing someone about to jump wasn't an easy thing to do. Some people climbed the rail just to have a picture taken. One gentlemen in the film talks on his cell phone, laughing, then closes it and puts it down, climbs the rail and immediately jumps. Though short, its a stunning scene in the film.

Of all those seen in the film jumping the camera nearly always cuts away before they hit the water. The fall is 245 feet and those jumping are traveling at 75 miles per hour as their body hits the bay. Its been described as a speeding truck meeting a concrete building. While the view of someone hitting isn't the gory sight that jumping from a building to the street would be, it is still disturbing. Of those witnessed in this film only one jump is shot from start to finish and that jumpers story is told from the beginning of the film through to the end.

The inspiration for the film maker was an article that talked about the jumpers from the bridge. It also discussed attempts to have suicide barriers placed along the bridge so that those wishing to jump couldn't do so. Believe it or not the attempts to have those put in place were argued against by people responsible for the bridge. The entire time I watched this movie all I could think of was why wouldnt you want to stop people from doing this?
I know this movie won't be for everyone. For anyone who has lost someone to suicide it will be a difficult film to watch. At the same time I think its important for people to see this film. If for no other reason than to see what it is that would inspire someone to take their own life. There are no clear cut signs that someone might do this and many of those interviewed had no idea it would happen. Then again there were some that knew it was only a matter of time. It would be nice to think that there was a way to help those who need it, those dealing with any mental issues that would cause them to do this, most notably depression which seems to run rampant these days.

I wouldnt say this is an entertaining film but it is an enlightening one. It does what a great documentary should do, it presents as unbiased an opinion on its topic as can be expected but at the same time realizes that there is a right and wrong involved in the story. As I said, perhaps the main thing about this film is that as people watch maybe theyll be inspired to look at their friend, neighbor or family member theyve been concerned about and take a moment to let them know they're there, to let them know that if they need help they can be counted on. In the end this movie give hope to the chance that people will walk away from it thinking about helping someone else. I cant think of a better objective for a movie to offer.",1426550400,5,5257,4.304040404040404

2791483,5,B000O76PXK,"I read about this documentary film in ""Vanity Fair"" magazine.  I bought the DVD after the suicide of Robin Williams.  I myself suffer from depression and generalized anxiety disorder and made a serious attempt at suicide in 2002 that failed.  It had been a split second decision - while headed off the road, in order to avoid a head-on collision, I realized that if I didn't step on my brakes my car would cascade down a very steep enbankment and everything would be ""so peaceful""...all the pain would be over.  My car got hung-up on underbrush and rocks and I got myself admitted to a psychiatric ward of a local hospital, for all of which I am deeply grateful.  There is a young man in this documentary who lives to tell about his jump from the bridge, which he immediately regretted. His story is very powerful. The general public doesn't realize that emotional pain is every bit as impossible to endure as  physical pain.  Among survivors of failed suicides, 73% say the acted on their impulse to commit suicide within 5 minutes to an hour of feeling the need to take this action.  Only 7% were sorry they did not die.  To me, the families and friends interviewed in this documentary are the heart and soul of what Eric Geleynse discovered over the course of making this documentary.

2791492,4,B000O76PXK,"An expectedly sober documentary that concerns itself with the unsettling allure of the Golden Gate Bridge as a popular suicide destination. It's sad but not mopey, interspersing long, lingering frames of the bridge in various weather conditions (often punctuated by a sudden, jarring splash beneath the span) with reflections upon the jumpers' troubled lives by their friends and family members. In a way it's heartening that so many of the subjects are calm, collected and rational about the event, having properly worked their way through the various stages of grief and come out the other side. They're changed, but they're also intact. Footage of the jumps themselves, collected through a year-long observation via telephoto lens, offer a vivid glimpse into these poor souls' most private moments. They vary from startling to heartbreaking, and often border on the voyeuristic. In one sense, it feels improper to share that intimate moment of climactic decision with strangers, but in another it lends their stories a sense of magnitude. These aren't just names in a list, empty faceless stories without a tether to our own reality - they're distinct individuals, emotively struggling to cope with something that's too large for their own conscience. As we hear the tale that led them to such a dark pit of despair, we see them quite physically grappling with that maddening choice. It's some of the most inarguably real footage I've ever seen on film, but I guess the greatest question here is; how real is *too* real?",1404345600,2,1523,5.096

2791497,4,B000O76PXK,"The Bridge is a documentary about the Golden Gate Bridge and the tragic loss of life that is voluntary given by so many. The film makers captured 23 of the 24 suicides that took place from the bridge in 2004, and show the stories and footage from some of those who jumped to their death as well as a survivor and a rescue.
While the subject matter is very dark and bleak, the stories run the full spectrum from awe inspiring and forgiving to maddeningly depressing. It is an eye opening look at something that we as a society choose not to see, or choose not to think about.

Eric Steele directs the documentary while conducting interviews with witnesses and family members of those who are no longer with us. Some have found an understanding and carry with them a forgiveness for those who chose to end their lives while others are still questioning and baffled by the loss. For anyone who has dealt with mental illness in their lives, whether it be through a family member, friend, or even themselves, there is a very real feel to the stories that one can easily understand. For those who have never experienced something as chaotic as mental illness, the film offers great insight into the human psyche and just how far we all are and feel from time to time.

From the thermals that warp the footage on hot days to the clouds and fog that roll into the bay and shroud the bridge in a mist, the film brings the viewer right up to the cold damp railing and lets you experience the rumble that vibrates through it as well as the bounce that you feel when you stand upon the bridge as a truck drives by. From the people who refuse to look up from their shoes as they walk by someone sitting on the railing to those who stop and try to talk to them, there is a sense of tragic loneliness as well as heroic interception that the film brings to the screen so beautifully in an agonizing way.",1375142400,6,1887,4.357954545454546

2791500,5,B000O76PXK,"I've represented clients in psychiatric commitment hearings for about 15 years now and and a great many of my clients are in the hospital against their will due to suicide attempts or threats.  My community also has two large bridges but suicide attempts off of them are almost unheard of.  ""The Bridge"" is an excellent account of what drives mentally ill people to take their lives and also shows the effect their suicides has on those that they leave behind.  The Golden Gate Bridge has had more suicides off of it than any other man-made structure and it attracts jumpers from all over the world---in the documentary one of the victims traveled all the way from North Carolina for his jump.  The filmmakers used telescopic lenses to film the bridge for all of 2004 from various angles and caught on film 22 of the 24 jumpers.  The filmmakers were in ethically murky territory.  They did not want anyone to learn of the real purpose of their project lest it encouraged more people to jump.  They filmed from such a long distance that they could not personally intervene in stopping the suicides although they did telephone the authorities if they spotted someone who appeared likely to jump.  The cameramen had to develop a sense of who they were trying to find among the thousands of pedestrians who cross the bridge every day.  Who looked distraught or whose behavior seemed out of the ordinary and suspicious.  What was bizarre is that some of the jumpers climbed over the railings with people walking right by either oblivious or unwilling to intervene.

The film interviews the surviving friends and family of the jumpers and pretty much without exception all of the jumpers were suffering from severe, long-term mental illness.  Many of these people isolated themselves away from their concerned friends and family and no doubt others had no friends or family involved with them anymore.  I've seen that a lot in my psychiatric law practice, that many people with long-term mental illness just end up driving their remaining friends and family away, the people just too exhausted to keep helping these suffering people",1372723200,8,2126,4.888579387186629

2791502,5,B000O76PXK,"This documentary was recommended to me by a colleague when we were chatting about documentaries to watch. He did warn me of the nature of the documentary and what I would see. I wrestled with actually watching it because my mind kept asking, ""Do I really want to watch people on what is assuredly the worst day of their life?"" A review of the documentary by the late Roger Ebert was my deciding factor. With no ethical predicament, I embarked on a journey that has stayed with me since the night I watched it, now almost a month ago. By putting aside any moral or religious beliefs, you can watch this movie as a true observer - much like the Bridge itself. It passes no moral judgements - it is just there. After watching the film, I was desperate to learn more about this phenomenon, and answer questions in my head such as ""Why is it so easy to jump from the Bridge?"" I subsequently read the original article that inspired Eric Steel, called ""Jumpers"" which appeared in New Yorker Magazine. I delved into the history of the Bridge, and recently finished the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Final-Leap-Suicide-on-the-Golden-Gate-Bridge/dp/0520272404/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Final Leap: Suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge</a>. I learned about efforts to build a Suicide Prevention Barrier at the Bridge, which has so far fallen on deaf ears, with one excuse after another. What The Bridge started, I continued in my education of a landmark that heretofore I just thought of a beautiful example of art deco. Walking down the street, we pass by 10's to 100's of people, not knowing their stories. One jumpers suicide note read ""I am walking to the Bridge now. If one person smiles at me, I won't jump."" He lived 28 blocks from the Bridge, and he jumped. Depression and mental illness has been a little discussed topic, and this film brings to light the dark night of the soul. ""If one person smiles at me..."" We as a community can help. Suicide is 100% preventable - staggering to think of that. I hope that the Bridge Rail foundation is successful in their endeavor for a suicide barrier - statistically speaking, on a follow up of people who either survived the jump (32 to date) or were prevented in making the jump, 94% were still alive, and their crisis had passed. Ken Baldwin, who survived the jump said, ""I realized as soon as my hands left the railing, that all my unsolvable problems were solvable. Except for the fact that I had just jumped."" The tantalizing thought of jumping from the Bridge, and in one step all problems vanishing is a compulsion that, if deterred, will most likely result in the individual realizing that tomorrow is a another day.

We live in an interesting time - pressures are more intense than ever. Apathy runs rampant. Walking down the street, we are lost in thoughts of our next appointment, what to make for dinner, etc etc etc. Depression DOES exist - Mental Illness DOES exist. It's okay to make eye contact with other humans, or even give a brief smile in passing - reconnecting ourselves as a society. It could have made a difference in someone's life. ""If one person smiles at me....""

One thought on Gene: Gene ""Thump"" Sprague walked the length of the Bridge for 93 minutes before he decided to jump. Eric Steel took Gene's story and wove it through the course of the film, which clocks in at 93 minutes. Gene touched a lot of people in his life, and his death. Gene was my age, and from everything I can figure, he was someone who would have been in ""my crowd"".  Maybe that's why his story resonated with me so much.  From what I have gathered, he was a talented artist - worked in the video game industry - and just wanted to love and be loved in return. Eric Steel said he really didn't think Gene was a candidate for jumping because he looked so free. Gene's LiveJournal has been kept up as a memorial to him - I doubt anyone that reads it will not recognize something they have heard a friend say - [...] . Eric Steel humanized him by having his story the overriding thread. And it is proof that every suicide is a waste of a beautiful life, a potential unrealized.

The thoughts this movie has evoked in me will stay with me forever. I waited a month before writing this review and it still jumbles all together. I encourage anyone interested in watching this to do so with an open mind. Yes the subject matter is disturbing and uncomfortable - it was the intent of the filmmaker. It is, in my opinion, Eric Steel's call to action - his statement saying - this is real - this is a problem - and we need to stop brushing it under the rug. He is right.

2791505,5,B000O76PXK,"Through interviews of loved ones and family members, The Bridge tells the stories of various people who have taken their own lives by jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. These interviews are extremely personal and honest, which makes for an emotionally powerful documentary. Along with the interview footage, there are several clips of the bridge itself, along with many clips of people actually jumping to their deaths. There are also interviews with those who seriously contemplated jumping but either survived or chose not to jump, and with those who witnessed someone jump from the bridge. This documentary aims to expand on the lives that are affected indirectly by those who have died by suicide and depict the effects that suicide has on family members and loved ones, and does so in a solemn but very interesting manner.

Personally, I very much enjoyed the documentary. I found it tough to watch at some points because I get very affected by the topic of suicide, but I also found it very touching and intriguing to watch. The hardest parts for me to watch were the clips of people actually jumping off the bridge, most likely to their deaths. I thought it was compelling to hear the points of view of the people attached to those who jumped and how it affected their lives, how they felt when they first found out, and their theories as to why their loved one or family member jumped. It was also fascinating to hear from a survivor of suicide named Kevin featured in the documentary. He discussed his struggles throughout life and his ultimate decision to end it, his journey to the bridge, and his final change of mind just after leaping over the railing. He provided a very honest and captivating account of his last thoughts and how it affected his own life as well as his friends' and family's lives. Unfortunately, many of the people who were interviewed did not seem to see the warning signs prior to their loved one's death. This definitely shows how important is to listen and talk to people who show even the slightest sign if suicidal behavior or ideation.

Overall, the documentary is very powerful as well as interesting (I might use the word ""entertaining"" if it didn't seem so inappropriate to use when referring to suicide). It provides a very personal portrayal of the impact suicide has on those around them, even if they simply happen to be strangers who witness an act of suicide such as some of those interviewed in this documentary. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in the topic of suicide, and anyone in general, so that they may learn the importance of listening and understanding what others are going through.",1352246400,5,2699,4.802150537634408
2791506,4,B000O76PXK,"The Bridge, a documentary film directed by Eric Steel, reveals the effects suicide has on loved ones. The Golden Gate Bridge in California is a notorious location for victims of suicide to jump to their deaths. More suicides occur at the Golden Gate Bridge than any other location. The Bridge documents suicides from several individuals and interviews people who were close to these people. The interviews contain stories told by family and friends of the suicidal persons as they describe events and feelings of the survivors from both before and after the victims committed suicide. This film shows real footage of people jumping off of the bridge, allowing the viewers of this film to be touched by both the shocking footage and the interviews told by loved ones.

The Bridge displays many different warning signs and risk factors such as the action of making remarks romanticizing death; such remarks should always be taken seriously. As seen in some of the interviews, the warning signs of those who have died by suicide were ignored. The film does a great job at teaching the value of listening.

Another great aspect of The Bridge, is that it documents stories of people of different personalities; both of the victims and the survivors. The suicides were sometimes clear, and other times not so clear and each suicide survivor portrays different reactions. The most influential of the stories told was the story told by Kevin, an individual who survived after jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. His story gives a perspective on why a person would commit suicide, portraying his emotions before and after his attempt.

I would recommend this film to a mature audience due to the shocking footage. The Bridge is a great film because it educates its viewers on warning signs, risk factors, the realities of suicide, and the effects suicide has on loved ones.",1352246400,4,1864,4.967948717948718
2791507,4,B000O76PXK,"The film centers around approximately a dozen stories of people's experiences with suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge. Often, the family and friends of those who died by suicide are recounting their emotions and actions leading up to and after their loved one's death. The film worked to portray significant evidence that more suicides occur at this bridge than any other location. It not only showed powerful footage, but also delved into how individuals chose the bridge as their last place to be alive.

I appreciated the film's footage. Yes, it is very disturbing watching an actual tape of not only one, but several people jumping to their death. However, I think that these images make the problem real for people. It is one thing to talk about a suicide, but another to witness it. The film in this respect puts a moderate fear arousal in its viewers. Another positive aspect of the film was that the director included a story of someone who had attempted suicide by jumping, yet lived. It was interesting to hear directly from the survivor (Kevin) about the thought process leading up to his intended suicide and after. In particular, he mentioned that the second he let go of the bridge and fell, he realized he did not want to die. Sadly, this is a fairly common sentiment of those who attempt suicide and end up dying by it. One critique that I do have of the film is the interviews done particularly with family members. In almost all cases, family and friends mentioned how there was nothing they could have done to prevent the suicide. I hope this is not a message to be taken away from the film. There is always another option besides suicide and they could have helped their loved ones more if they had tried harder I believe. Often, they ended up saying the wrong sentiments (Ex. you can't commit suicide because you have an obligation to stay here for me) A better way to put this could simply be ""I don't want you to die"". It also bothered me how many victims admitted they were considering suicide, yet they were not taken seriously and took their lives as a consequence.

This film is important because it brings light to a serious issue in America. It forces people to realize that suicide happens and that it is not a pretty thing. It is not glamorous. What should be taken away from this film is the knowledge that rather than giving up like so many of those interviewed, know that suicides can be prevented. Be educated on suicide, and educate others. This film is a great first step to raising awareness of the issue and showing it in a realistic light.",1352246400,5,2579,4.604347826086957
2791508,4,B000O76PXK,"The mission of the documentary, The Bridge, is to show viewers the effects suicide can have on everyone that is ultimately involved. The Bridge aims to prove that suicide is not just about the suicidal individual, but the friends and family as well.
The film tells several stories of people that committed suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. The film tells these stories primarily through interviews with families, friends, and even bystanders that either witnessed the jump, or were the last people to see the person before they jumped. By including several interviews with loved ones, the film succeeds in illustrating to the viewer the types of emotions loved ones can feel after losing someone to suicide. The film did a really good job of including many different types of situations that warranted the suicide attempts, and also including many different ways that the families and friends coped with the loss of someone to suicide. It is no question that the film was successful in touching people's emotions, as all the interviews, images, and situations were real.

Although the director may have never intended to, the film also teaches people the importance of listening. Many of the stories told included many risk factors and warning signs that went unnoticed by family members prior to the jump. Because of this, the film definitely has the potential to anger many people. I would recommend this film to people who are open to talking about suicide, and would not become very angry at the complicated task of preventing suicide and getting loved ones help while still respecting them.

Probably the best part about this documentary is the one story about Kevin, a man who attempted suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, but lived. Through interviews with Kevin, the film provides answers to many of the questions society has about suicide, and how someone could bring him or herself to want to end their own life. Hearing the feelings of a suicide survivor is a very unique part of the film, The Bridge.

Overall, I would recommend this documentary to most everyone. It informs people about the effects suicide has on friends and family, and it does a good job of discussing suicide as something that is very real to a lot of people.",1352246400,4,2266,4.895833333333333
2791509,4,B000O76PXK,"I'm (almost) speechless after seeing The Bridge. It truly affected me...so much so, I replayed the entire movie a second time immediately.

As a Bay Area native, the folklore is long over this man-made expanse and I even remotely know someone who took the leap. The editing is superb and the interviewees are left to tell their stories without the intrusion of an interviewer. The impact, palpable. With one exception for me, the soundtrack was almost another character itself.

It wasn't until I did a little research afterward that I found out that all of the footage was shot during 2004 by the film maker; I figured there may have always been cameras perched around the bridge in hopes of intervening with the jumpers. While the subject matter may upset many viewers, I found this to be one of the most compelling documentaries I have ever seen and I'm a docu-junkie.

2791510,3,B000O76PXK,"I watched this movie last night and thought two stars but after sleeping on it I'll rate it 3 stars. Before writing this movie review I read many if not most of the other reviews and it seems to me that a lot of the negative reviewers are reviewing suicide rather than a movie documenting suicides. A camera operator isn't supposed to intervene, think the Rodney King beating. Had the camera man intervened rather than minding the camera we wouldn't have the incident recorded. Besides a suicide attempt foiled is likely at attempt delayed is all.

I have a neutral opinion on suicide but a positive opinion on our right to our own lives. We will never get euthanasia if we don't even have the right to commit suicide. Let them jump, there is no shortage of people, just the opposite, there are too many people.

As to the movie itself it's not as good as the trailer; the extra features help, it's somewhat boring and repetitive; there is more time spent with friends and family members than actual jumpers. Maybe they should have taken two years to make it and got more minutes of jumps and less interviews of those left behind. I didn't notice the camera cutting away before the splat but if that's the case it's a shame. I did see several splashes without seeing the fall though, maybe I blinked. What I really missed was interviews with those who survived; I wanted to hear what it's like, not the suicide prevention plug that was inserted which I think diminished from the movie. If there was only one survivor that year they should have kept shooting until they got more survivors, that's where the real interest is, in what the survivors have to offer. The rest are history.

For those who say build a barrier I say build a platform so people could jump at will without causing a commotion on a busy thoroughfare. Of course that's not going to happen as long as suicide is against the law. Say what's the punishment? Oregon and Washington are the only states that have Death with Dignity laws on the books at this time. What a shame and you have to be almost dead to use them anyway. I guess all we are is tax payers after all to the government or is religion saying we don't have the right to leave on our own steam?

This is a good first effort by Eric Steel. I would have appreciated some more data in the special features like the most popular month, day, time, birth sign, age, most popular spot, weather pattern those kinds of things which likely are of interest to more than just me.

Since they were there for a year it would have been nice if they had some non suicide events included like were there any bungee jumpers, paraglider pilots, or parachute jumps or was it all simple suicides? No murders even or fights? I also wonder and suspect there were likely another 24 at night unnoticed.",1337990400,,2808,4.487279843444227

While the familes were so sad to have lost their loved ones in that manner, I was moved by their struggle to understand and accept the fact that their loved one was in pain and had the right to go on to the next dimension(if there is one and I so hope there is)or at least be at peace.  As a parent I was particularly struck by the thought that your kids do not owe it to you to stick around and live for your sake. I think a parent owes that to their child but had to agree that my children do not owe that to me. If they were truly depressed and not just situationally depressed, it is hard for me to justify my child living in pain just because of me. I never thought about it that way before.

it reminded me of those horrible images none of us will ever be able to forget on 9/11 - the people who jumped from the towers.  i had the same feeling as i watched the jumpers on the bridge - this can't be real - there has to be a huge net somewhere underneath that i can't see - that's a stunt man/woman - not a real person.  but they were all real - too real.  i also didn't expect to get such a close view of them, either.  i thought jumpers would all be too far enough way to be distinct (they weren't) - i also thought they would be noticeably upset and crying (no again) and standing apart from the crowds.  but every jumper you see - you also see tourists or joggers, walkers, etc. only a few feet away.

the eeriest part were the long shots of the bridge - too far away to make out the people on the sidewalks, only the traffic moving along and the boats in the distance.  then, out of nowhere, you hear and see a sudden large splash in the water below the bridge and you know someone else has just jumped.  it is the loneliest sound.

the interviews are painful to witness, the helplessness, the sadness, the anger - all real emotions these people will unfortunately deal with for the rest of their lives.  the most compelling part of the whole thing was the segment with kevin - the young man who jumped and managed to survive.  an amazing feat in itself, but if his story doesn't move you, you are unmovable.

i felt slightly better when i watched an interview with eric steel when he said the whole time they watched the bridge, they had the bridge patrol's number on their speed dial to try and prevent anyone from jumping if they could - and they did prevent a few - you see at least a couple of people who get pulled back.  a list of the people who jumped off the golden gate bridge in 2004 is shown at the end and i was amazed and horrified at how often it occurs - at least one to three people a month. i hope that at least some of the proceeds on this went to some sort of suicide prevention organization, or maybe the families, though it would be a paltry compensation, i'm sure.",1332720000,3,2898,4.072183098591549

This video though really sad gave me some insights as to how the survivors carry on, and what makes a human being jump from a 220 foot high structure. It was a truly professionally well done, but must have been confronting, terrifying for the camera people. The strength of the survivors was evident, but there may have been times they crumble.

It was sad, but gave me hope that there are people out there who care. It was really amazing seeing the local police lean over and pull some people back from the edge of hopelessness. It was really sad also to see people's inaction when they sat on the edge of the barriers, stood up, jumped I read a comment about a person who wanted to go live near the bridge, so she could stop (or try) these lonely, sad people throwing their lives away.

2791517,2,B000O76PXK,"I would love to see this topic in the hands of someone like Johnny O'Hara or Lisa F. Jackson, who are experienced with making documentaries and are good at it. I felt this looked so amateur at times that the interviews reminded me of mockumentaries such as Waiting for Guffman or Best in Show.  The only interview that wasn't a mess was the old lady friend of Gene's.  Also the director jumped around way too much. Why not just stick with one person and flesh them out in a more concise picture?  At times it was confusing as to which jumper they were referring to, with friends voicing over, and footage thrown here and there. The only person who I felt I had a full picture of was Gene. Why not develop the people's stories more rather than showing endless pictures of the bridge with maudlin music playing in the background. And then there were people dropping into it the water out of no where with  this big splash, I mean it was almost comical at times. I also felt they  needed more variety. Not all people who kill themselves are on psychiatric drugs.

The Golden Gate Bridge as a bridge to ending your life is fascinating so why not show more of the footage he gathered and get more stories, there were 24 people who died that year.

The biggest point that was missed is the question: why do so many people commit suicide? What about our society isn't working when suicide is the third biggest cause of death in teenagers and up until age 24? It's not only the result of having schizophrenia b/c of some genetic aberration. There are environmental links as well in terms of causes. I feel the director dropped the ball on this and the whole documentary overall.

If you watch this, and you aren't left with the feeling that this documentary was woefully incomplete, I would be surprised. On the other hand, if you are interested in the topic of suicide, then that itch gets scratched a little bit by some of the insights of one or two of the family and friends left behind.

2791518,5,B000O76PXK,"I will be blunt in my review. I had been suicidal from the age of 13 all the way to 21. I hated my father, my stepmom and my stepbrother. I stayed in my room, no longer able to relate to any of them. Anytime I would come out of my room they would say ""... is coming out of his cave"". I hated that, but I could not tell them what was going on in my head. Time passed between 13 to 17, my depression getting worse while I lived with my father. During this time I had suicidal thoughts everyday I woke up, when I ate, when my father yelled at me. Many people can't understand what is going on behind the visage of a persons exterior. I was pretty much just a husk of a person. As I was yelled at I would stare blankly into my fathers eyes, soaking in every scathing word, thinking meanwhile about the different ways I could end my life and then he would be sorry. When I received my car between 17 and 18 I thought of driving away and ending my life. One of the places I thought of going was this bridge, so far away but at the time it would have been worth it. I moved to my mothers upon graduation. During college my fathers pestering about school, my health insurance, relationships and school finally boiled over. I attempted suicide in October of 2007 and was talked out of it by at the time the most recent ex-gf. I was sent to a mental health facility to get treatment and was eventually let out. Upon moving back to my mothers after changing schools, I came across this movie on TV in 2008. In short, I could relate to every bit of this film. It was as if somebody went into my mind and extracted all the feelings, thoughts and actions I had done over my life until that time. I broke down when I saw it, remembering what I had gone through. It was not a bad breakdown, more as if somebody truly had tried to understand what I had gone through. I too had my last meal, it was at IHOP, chicken tenders, fries, garlic toast and regular honey for the tenders. I only bring it up because there was somebody who talked about having their last meal.

This is probably long winded and others may say that it is wrong to give even a general view of what happened in my life. I don't care, I am writing this as somebody who can relate to this, it truly can make other people have a glimpse of what is going on in like minds. It makes me sad that people look at this as a production, how the climax is one guy. These people are missing the whole picture, this was made to give people insight into people like me, the very soul of the documentary. I encourage people who don't plan on buying it to at least rent it and keep an open mind into trying to understand.

Of course, we get A+ in school for writing overcomplicated reports, and so the habit of grasping simple things often is lost in those who have the greatest innate ability. Here are some simple things:

1. The thesis of the film is that a whole lot of people jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.

2. The movie is amateurish because professionals were too busy making HBO documentaries and very special episodes of ""Webster"" to dream up such a film, much less make it.

3. The film is not very informative because it doesn't take a doctoral dissertation to explain the thesis ""A whole lot of people jump off the Golden Gate Bridge"".

That interview with the young man who survived.....when he said that as soon as he let go he knew he wanted to live.....well, that just gave me goose bumps. In those few seconds, he actually was able to re-adjust his body and its trajectory to increase his chance of survival.

I think the interesting thing about the filming is exactly how most of the suicides are shown as just a splash in the water.. even the people shown in their full trajectory are done so until the last second, then the camera moves away to not portray the impact. Why? For the same reason the people who were interviewed distanced themselves from the reality of the jumpers. After all, people pretend to be all-knowing about what goes on inside the heads of everyone else.. if someone kicks me in the shin, they may imagine it is hurting and maybe even titrate the imaginative scale of pain according to whatever past experiences they may have had.. but they won't know how much it hurts to me.. nobody will, except me...  And I find it interesting how cavalier even the family members were in their discourse. Similar to the story about Samuel Beckett visiting a psychiatric facility and meeting a schizophrenic. His description was ""he was like a hunk of meat, there was no one there"".  And this is a Nobel Prize winner... Anyway, it is disappointing to see ourselves reduced to a splash in obscure waters or encapsulated within the spectrum of mental illness. It certainly keeps the ""normal"" people away from such a nefarious reality. Truth be told, interviews with many people who survived jumping off bridges reveal that most of them immediately regretted their decision. The desire for life is present in everyone, but we create layer upon layer of denial and repression to suffocate it.. living an inane life and smirking about random death is a horrendous way to live.. so the question is, what extreme jolt would it take to remove you from your own powerfully repressed psychotic universe?

2791528,4,B000O76PXK,"This documentary draws you in. Although it is a little creepy, you can't help but be intrigued by what drives people to suicide and what drove them to want to jump off of this bridge. In this documentary, those that take their own lives by jumping off of this bridge all had one thing in common: they were all obsessed with this bridge. They were drawn to this bridge as if it were calling them to come and jump off of it, and they all seemed at peace with death and specifically wanted to end their lives at this bridge.

It is a little haunting that this bridge has absolutely no safety net or fence to discourage potential jumpers. The guard rail is literally chest high and can easily lure a jumper right over it's edge. there is absolutely no determent whatsoever. Another thing I found eerie, is how the camera captures each jumper from the time they hop over the rail all the way down to the plunge in the water. The lens literally follows them all the way down, which tells me there was a person behind the lens watching them on the bridge and saw them contemplating their jump.

How does someone just standby and allow another human being to take their own life without some kind of intervention? almost every jumper stood on the bridge looking over the rail for quite a while before they actually jumped. You can tell they were psyching themselves up to do it because they all seemed a little hesitant at first. They would start to climb over rail and then hesitate as if they were having second thoughts, but ultimately they all eventually took that leap off and plunged to their death.

The camera even captures their splash into the water. I believe there was plenty of time for the producer of this documentary (or the camera man) to call the bridge tower and notify the guard on duty that there was a potential jumper on deck and the guard could have intervened and prevented their demise. I think these people could have been saved, in my personal opinion. I do not recommend anyone watching this film if they are experiencing depression or suicidal thoughts, it can push you over the edge. (no pun intended)",1256083200,2,2124,4.511688311688312
2791529,1,B000O76PXK,"Where documentary-makers significantly differ from film-makers can be expressed in two areas. Firstly in their responsibility and secondly in the fact that once a documentary has been shot it can never really be returned to and re-made; not in the way a regular film can. If a documentary, therefore, both squanders its opportunity and negates its responsibility, it represents a double tragedy. That is what this 'documentary' is and does.

The actual subject matter for this film could have been quite sound indeed and had massive potential to open both doors and discussions on a very real and engaging subject. Because of the general aversion to documentaries on death, dying and especially suicide, what 'director' Eric Steele had potentially stumbled upon here, was of the last chances in documentary-making to tread on virgin territory, yet another travesty.

Essentially what Steele offers up is ultimately no more than any film student on a B.A. course anywhere could have done. That is to imply that this effort suffers from weaknesses in five main areas. Areas which one might correlate to inexperience and youthful inadequacies when applied to an under-graduate, however, weaknesses that point to genuine shortcomings when applied to a supposed professional. Those weaknesses in no order of importance are:

i) A sever lack of cohesion, no real central thesis. Something which seems to have had the brief written after the shoot.
ii) Inferior image quality and selection of shots.
iii) Incompatible, and dull soundtrack, inappropriate choice of music and improper linking of music and images.
iv) Inclusion of much that is irrelevant. Again, linking with the first point. There sees to be a lot of 'winging' it here, going with the flow, found imagery and all that terminology which really means lack of planning and preparation, lack of foresight and imagination.
v) Dishonesty and lack of professionalism.

Anyone who knows anything about reading films or has encountered and engaged with deconstructing the documentary as a means of communicating the Truth, will immediately spot the aforementioned in this really quite mediocre effort. That said the last point may not be self-explanatory and so it is to that I would briefly like to turn and elaborate.

Steel was given permission by the Bridge Authority to film, because he said he was making a film which aimed ""to capture the powerful, spectacular intersection of monument and nature that takes place every day at the Golden Gate Bridge. He did not, it did not. I would say that was dishonest.

In a BBC interview (freely available on YouTube), Steel said that he did not inform the loved ones of the deceased, that he had footage of their final moments, because he did not want people then heading to the bridge and jumping in an attempt to immortalise themselves on celluloid. As the relatives and friends were interviewed after their nearest and dearest had perished this makes no logical sense. It is a totally incoherent and irrational argument, in fact it is not even an argument per se. I therefore concur that he mislead these individuals and tricked them into co-operating. And here he was doubly deceitful because he starts to play an afterthought excuse that he was interested in mental-health issues, when he clearly was not because he brought nothing to the table on such a debate.
N.B. By stringing out the last jumper's pacing up and down and mixing that footage with interviews filmed with his friends, all of which was spread throughout most of the film and then by finally showing his very spectacular and showman-esque demise; the MOST spectacular..., one feels obliged to question if Steele, by his editing and his cinematic choices, did not achieve that posthumous immortalise ation for that last individual who was shown so graphically committing suicide.

To summate. Exceptionally poor documentary making. A tragic waste of a one time opportunity to face and deal with many issues and then lead society through the tragedy to further discussion and debate and ultimate understanding and progress.",1255996800,10,4090,5.122938530734633

2791539,4,B000O76PXK,"I've heard before that California, and especially San Francisco, have a high suicide rate because it is the last place people might try to live before they give up.  If they can't make their lives work there, they figure they can't make them work anywhere so might as well end their lives.  So they jump off the bridge and this usually this kills them.  So many visitors go to the Golden Gate bridge and let their video cameras just run and run that a fair amount of raw footage over the years has caught people taking the jump.  This documentary doesn't just cover the actual suicide though but goes further by delving into the survivors and the stories they have to tell about the jumpers and then themselves in the aftermath.  This documentary isn't for everyone as it is a pretty grim topic and there is no upside to the story.  All these people do indeed kill themselves and all we do in the documentary is explore the details of each suicide.  My husband and I both found it very interesting. We have known those who committed suicide so had high interest in the subject going into the documentary.

I was glad Eric Steel made a distinction between mental illness and suicide, although a number of people who are mentally ill decide to take their own life.

Unless you have been there, it can be difficult to understand why or how a human being could come to the place of experiencing so much despair that they'd no longer want to live. I never moralize over someones decision to want to check out - I can merely understand that it sucks to continue to live in pain. I'm not mentally ill, however, when I attempted to end my life on whatever occasion, the pain I experienced bypassed the resources to cope.

I liked the depth Eric Steel went to as he supported family members to tell their story, and I can appreciate how people were sad when their loved one decided to end their life. I am sure it must be very hard to live with the aftermath.

I feel better now and understand that out time on this earth is finite, and that if I ended my life I'd merely be killing the wrong person.

Should they put up a better barrier or leave this beautiful monument unmarred by an unsightly structure? Save lives or preserve the aesthetic character of the Golden Gate Bridge? That was one interesting issue that is raised. I say leave the bridge alone. There are other barriers that these individuals break through before getting to the bridge. Society's failures as well as those of the individual are what lead people to take that leap and the bridge jumpers should force people that care to look at those.

You can say it reflects the personality of the city.  It's a magical place, an enduring engineering marvel...and a suicide magnet.

It's that last feature that drew Producer/Director Eric Steel to this project (though it's in question just how open he was with the Golden Gate Bridge Authority in regards to his proposed subject matter).

It would have been easy for Steel to piece together a sensational or voyeuristic film given the nature of the footage he collected while filming at the bridge for a year.  Instead, he's put together an unsettling but ultimately deeply moving work that seeks to define bridge jumpers as real human beings, not just statistics.  Indeed, the most compelling scenes in the film aren't the ones at the bridge; they're the emotional, affecting interviews with friends and family of the jumpers. It's clear they're still reeling from the events.

2791553,5,B000O76PXK,"When I decided to view this documentary, I was in belief that only a portion of the story would be about the suicides.  I had believed that you would see the majestic, technical and mechanical elements of the San Francisco bridge.  It is not about that, it is all about the use of the bridge as a tool to end your life.  You will see and feel the desperation and anguish that leads someone to take advantage of the bridge - to end their life here, and to use this bridge as the means just because it is there!

Come to grips with the end
This lengthy 2004 documentary is a study of the people who come to grips that this is the method to accomplish that.  Pay close attention to the stories of family and friends of the dead.  You may get confused about the people the interviewees speak of.  Heartbreaking stories of family and friends interweave with footage of people on the bridge.

Graphic
In the yearlong study, photographers captured the people on the bridge.  You will see actual jumps!  Some footage is plentiful, while other jumps are not as graphic.  And, that is one of the most painful things to watch, the leap from that bridge, the leap that is the end.  You will hear how a young man changed his mind and lived to tell about it.

Not exploitive
Some might feel that this graphic view of suicide jumps is exploitive, but the film allows the viewer to FEEL for the person jumping.  The healthy minded person can't imagine climbing that rail knowing the horrendous outcome.  But to the mentally ill or depressed person, it comes without much thought.  It is an educational insight for anyone who may recognize the signs of desperation.

Special Features
The extra feature here is the role photographers play in recording daily the people, watching out for the loner and their telltale signs.  You will see some people get pulled away, and at times you can only believe they wanted to be stopped.

Fortunately, I have not had an experience with someone who attempted or mastered suicide.  This is an education, read the signs, give someone hope......Rizzo",1219708800,2,2067,4.595628415300546
2791554,5,B000O76PXK,"I had never heard of this film until I caught it on tv.  I was at once spellbound.  The subject is people who jump from the Golden Gate Bridge.  It is a very poignant documentary about people who commit suicide off this grand structure and the effect their deaths have on the ones left behind.  Be forewarned.  This film documents 23 of the known 24 suicides in year 2004.  Some one called this a snuff film and I admit it has the shocking effect of a snuff film but I am convinced beyond a doubt that it was not Eric Steel's intention to create a snuff film when he made this movie.  With camera's strategically placed, Eric and his staff documented suicides in progress.  Some successful, some rescued.  His staff often intervened to try and rescue the jumpers before they jumped.

It is a disturbing film and it is also heart wrenching.  There are in depth interviews with some of the friends and family left behind.  Those left behind are always so stunned.  Even if they had an inkling of the suicide's intention, they are always shocked, stunned, full of guilt.  A co-worker of mine committed suicide in 2000 and I remember feeling all those emotions.  Those emotions rocked me to the core and her suicide haunted me for years.  I was left wondering, why didn't she say something?  She was always smiling!  Then last year my ex-husband's favorite brother committed suicide and again I felt those over-powering emotions of shock and surprise.

Seeing this movie literally horrified me that people can be so severely depressed and insomnia-ridden that they choose to die rather than live.  It's like they don't realize that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

I cannot understand why this bridge does not have a suicide barrier.  Yes the politician's arguments may seem valid, but when people are easily climbing over a bridge's 4 foot barrier and jumping to their deaths, it's obvious something HAS to be done.

I would like to point out that the filmaker was limited in condensing such a powerful subject into only 90 minutes.  Some topics were handled too sparingly as a result.  For anyone who was as intrigued by this film as I was, I would encourage you to check out the series ""Lethal Beauty"" published by the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper and available online.

2791567,4,B000O76PXK,"When I asked my husband what movie we were watching tonight and he gave me this films description, I was immediately repulsed.  I argued with him about watching such a depressing film and pretty much begged him to find something else on TV.  I had no interest in watching people leap to their deaths and then listen to their families as they morn their lost loved ones.

As is usually the case in remote control wars in my home, I lost.  So I grabbed my book and settled in to ignore the tube.  Five minutes into it, my book was forgotten and I was riveted.  As silly as this may sound, it wasn't as depressing as I thought it would be.  It's shocking, disturbing, sad and tragic, but more than that it's fascinating.  I could not believe how many people have killed themselves on that bridge.  It's frightening.

I was really against watching this film as I have had two people I have loved deeply commit suicide.  There isn't a pain on this earth that is comparable to the pain that friends and family experience after someone kills themselves.  I didn't want to watch others go through what I have already gone through, I thought it would be too hard.  Surprisingly the friends and families are at a place in the grieving process where they have accepted what happened and some even understand why it happened.  A lot of the people who jumped had a history of mental illness or some sort of long term problems.  One father seemed to find his peace by thinking his son was finally got what he wanted, that he was finally happy.

The absolute desperation these people must have felt to take such a terrifying leap is palpable.  It's impossible to not feel empathy for all those involved.  Despite the subject matter, it's not a gory film and it doesn't glorify, over dramatize, or try to play with the sympathies and emotions of the viewer.  I am not sure what purpose this film serves, but for me it helped me see the suicides of my loved ones in a little different light, maybe I won't be so angry anymore, maybe I can find my peace in their peace.

Kudos also to the families and friends who were courageous enough to speak about their losses and about what might have driven their friends and loved ones to kill themselves in this way.
Only a couple of the jumps are shown in their entirety but I would not call them graphic.  The jumpers hit the water very fast, and there is obviously no corpse or blood shown afterwards.  Recovery of the bodies by the shore patrol was not shown because it was simply not necessary.
The film certainly gives the rest of us a lot to think about:  how fortunate we are if we never consider suicide; how much we have to be grateful for if we do not suffer from constant disappointment and despair; how hard it is to have, or to live with someone who has, a mental or emotional illness, which can be extremely difficult to treat and a terrible burden for all concerned.",1210723200,4,1094,4.623711340206185

I don't know if it's ""natural"", but suicide and suicidal influences are quite common in everyday life, like ""kill me"" as a way of frustration. People aren't usually pushed to actually doing it though, so I liked how you learn what drove the different deceased people to jump throughout the movie. The weird thing about this documentary is that it can be both blunt and boring. It is really low budget, so it requires active listening, even though what's being discussed is pretty charged. It is never aware of the audience. Everything said gets the same treatment, regardless of how important it may be in one of the several stories told, and from a superficial standpoint, all you're really getting are a series of slow, droning accounts of what once was, presented in small fragments, one after another. Even though there is a quite a bit of emotion involved, the participants don't let it show.

2791572,2,B000O76PXK,"Even at a fleet 94 minutes, this infamous 2006 documentary feels overlong and rather padded despite the visceral shock of witnessing a man throwing himself off the Golden Gate Bridge. This wide-angle, long-distance shot opens Eric Steel's oddly uninvolving study of the twenty-four people who decided to use the fatalistic landmark to end their lives in 2004. Twenty-three succeeded, and Steel's multiple camera set-up captured most of them. In his eerie film, he focuses on a handful of the victims and lets the grieving families speak about them. Apparently, they were unaware that the filmmaker had the footage in his possession, a deliberate decision in that Steel did not want to encourage any further suicide attempts due to the film. At the same time, there is something undeniably exploitative about his approach.

Although the images on the bridge are startling with a sense of foreboding that I personally found unbearable, the interviews with the friends and relatives are not all that engaging probably because their comments start to feel repetitive no matter whom the victim is. In attempting to capture the human spirit in crisis, especially with the presence of Alex Heffes' (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dear-Frankie/dp/B00094AS9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dear Frankie</a>) melancholic music to underscore the shots, Steel maintains a perspective that feels too myopic since the testimonies in themselves cannot give the full story behind the motivations of the so-called jumpers. Consequently, there is no palpable sense of intimacy with the victims. Moreover, Steel consciously avoids contextual discussions with city officials or psychiatric professionals. They could have lent a broader perspective on the issue, especially when it comes to the constant debate over installing suicide barriers.

The one exception is Kevin Hines, a young man with bipolar disorder who was the only survivor in 2004. Only he is able to describe what it was like to have jumped off the bridge. He survived because he decided to shift feet-first when he regretted his decision in mid-jump. The most disheartening aspect of Hines' account is how he gave obvious signs of his hopelessness to indifferent passers-by for forty minutes only to be accosted by a German tourist to take a picture. The 2007 DVD offers a making-of featurette which provides Steel's perspective on the film, a valuable extra since he is absent in the documentary itself. He and his crew are interviewed to elaborate on their experiences in filming the suicide attempts. There is also a PSA featuring Hines for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline.",1202601600,6,2667,5.48661800486618

The Bridge is a disturbing Documentary not because of its subject but for the reasons why anyone would want to make it.

The Film is exploitative in the extreme. An awful twickly piano score, the type of which you have heard a hundred times in manipulative Hollywood movies, pervades the long and exceedingly boring film.

To be brutally honest the only reason anyone would be interested in watching this film is to see people jumping to their deaths. The filmmakers themselves are aware of this and so they try to legitimize their subject with the duplicity of appearing concerned.

The majority of the inarticulate talking heads shed no light on suicide. Why would they? Suicide is a very personal thing. Their opinions are liberally peppered with `you know', which has become America's most frequently expression.

The camera work is also practically shoddy. The first leap that is shown in medium shot is completely missed by the cameraman. The filmmakers create `the tension', by the threat of showing someone jump to their death, which I find rather sick and voyeuristic.

With all that is going on in the world could these manipulative filmmakers not have chosen a safer topic to shoot? I think these intrepid filmmakers should volunteer to go to Iraq immediately and cover the more complicated subject of Suicide Bombings.",1195257600,3,1342,4.995515695067264

It is very dramatic and depressing, and perhaps lacking in diversity of its imagery and narrative - it gets a little redundant after a while - there also really are no conclusions - more of an expose, and a very depressing one at that, but groundbreaking and important.

Some people will find the video of the jumpers exploitative, but I like to think the jumpers and their survivors to some degree appreciate that their final moments were shared and attempted to be understood, even if it is after the fact.",1195171200,5,731,4.7936507936507935

2791579,4,B000O76PXK,"I inadvertently ran across mention of this film while surfing for information on the Golden Gate Bridge and quickly became intrigued by it's theme.  There is some interesting information on various websites that is worth reviewing.

At first thought, the theme of the film is a bit morbid but it should be kept in mind by the viewer that it is a very important and prevalent human condition that has touched the lives of a great portion of our society in one way or another.  My guess is that a significant portion of our population has dealt with uncontrollable depression and contemplated suicide at some point in their lives.  If they haven't, then they have likelly had a close family member or friend who has.

One of the things that I appreciate about the film is that is remains neutral on the topic and simply tells the story of those who've decided to take this fateful path.  I'm not sure if this fact is brought out in the film or if I caught it on an associated website, but I think that it is profound that a number of individuals who've survived their jump from the bridge had thoughts along the lines of ""What did I just do?  I wish that I hadn't done that!""

At any rate, I found this to be a very interesting film on a very real and prevalent human condition.  I certainly recommend it.",1191024000,4,1303,4.418410041841004

The ending sticks with you forever. I'm not kidding, it's like you're right there and it burns into your brain like you're on an acid trip while playing the latest Nam role-player. Do you think it was going around on Internet message boards that the film crew had their cameras continuously trained on the bridge? Can characters in documentaries be nominated for best supporting roles? But this isn't really a documentary; it's a severely edited snoop into a foolish form of performance art. But what if killing yourself is the only way to get into heaven? Who'll be laughing then, am I right? Could you go through with it even knowing eternal paradise awaited when you awoke from carnality? It's apparent right now that I like asking questions. I don't normally like to be so transparent, but this bridge thing has really gotten to me.

2791582,1,B000O76PXK,"Unlike Tad Friend's excellent New Yorker article upon which the film credits its genesis, The Bridge confuses voyeurism with empathy and rubbernecking with compassion.  While documenting numerous bridge suicides over the course of its ninety minutes, the narrative continues to stalk one disturbed individual through a telephoto lens as he anxiously paces the bridge's railing, saving his plunging death for the story's climax.  Did the cinematographer phone 911 while awaiting this torn soul's decision to jump?  Or did he patiently keep his subject in focus for 45 minutes in order to get the ultimate money shot?  Absent more information from the filmmakers, the viewer is left criminally complicit in the choice to sit back and watch without offering help as each of the mentally ill and/or profoundly depressed victims climb over the railing and jump.  We are then conveniently treated to interviews with loved ones and relatives to find out more about what led them to suicide.
Strangely, there is no discussion about the city wrestling with its culpability in choosing to leave its biggest tourist attraction unmarred by safety nets.  Additionally, the perspectives of family members on mental illness and depression were personal but sadly incomplete.  Are these omissions because no one from the city's bridge commission or any health care professional (bound by Hippocratic oath) agreed to appear in what ends up being an ethically problematic and ultimately irresponsible film?  One is left with the uneasy feeling that had the filmmakers intervened on behalf of the victims there would have been nothing to watch - or perhaps with more courage they would have ended up making a very different film.  I would rather have watched that.",1189296000,20,1745,5.248201438848921

2791584,5,B000O76PXK,"When I visited San Francisco last year, I honestly didn't know that the Golden Gate Bridge was the one place on planet earth in which the most suicides were carried out: roughly one self-inflicted death has occurred there every two weeks for the past seventy years. All I knew then was that the majestic bridge was awe-inspiring, and walking its length was one of the highlights of my west coast trip. Recently, though, my feelings about that fabled location changed, most likely forever, and I attribute that up to Eric Steel's documentary The Bridge.

I credit Steel with the lack of sensationalism in this disturbing but somehow dignified film. It is the work of an entire year of patient filming alongside the Golden Gate Bridge, and it is an undertaking which I'm sure will never be duplicated by any other American filmmaker. The entire tone of the movie is one of hushed, subdued stillness, and Steel does not intrude with commentary or judgment, merely focuses in on each death and provides a background to these individual tragedies. There is horror here in this subject, and yet I, someone highly vulnerable to the effects of sad events caught on tape, could not help but look on during each frame of this production, start to finish. I looked on, even as I felt the weight of loss steal into me and set my heart pounding. There was not one suicide Steel showed during which I did not want to cry out and somehow wish away what I was seeing before me, these people who were one moment alive and then they were not. ""Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it,"" I kept thinking. And yet during the run-time nearly two-dozen people jumped and died.

I literally did not sleep the night I saw this DVD.

The Bridge is among the most powerful examples of filmmaking I have witnessed, and it is life-changing. I can honestly admit that now, a year after my first visit to the Golden Gate Bridge, I'm not sure I'd want to go back. And if I did I could never again walk across that soaring space without a keen awareness that I was passing across a site on which over 1200 people knew such misery that they threw themselves outward into death: a concept that smothers me with incomprehensible dread.

The Bridge deserves five stars. It is great. But please be aware before you see it that what you'll watch in its ninety minutes will never leave your mind.",1188432000,15,2354,4.557919621749409

In some of the reviews, people stated they would have liked to have seen the bridge staff or coast guard interviewed to round out the movie.  If you understand how the movie was made, you would realize that would not have been possible.  We were interviewed 3 months after my sister jumped, not knowing any footage had been filmed at the bridge until the following year.  Would we have participated if we knew?  Absolutely not.  The permits needed to film the bridge for the year 2004 did not specify they were looking for jumpers.  They were implying ""a year in the life of a bridge"".  Now that we have seen this film, we are very grateful that the director, Eric Steel was true to his word by not sensationalizing these events.  I think he made it as sensitive as possible for a subject like this.
This film is not for everyone.  These are truly real people in their last moments.  The thought and the images can haunt you for a very long time.

2791598,3,B000O76PXK,"Ever since I saw a bridge jumping survivor on Larry King last year, and watched the trailer soon after, I have been eagerly awaiting this DVD.  I live in Seattle and damn near drove to Portland when I saw it was playing there in February.  Instead, I awaited the release and arrived at the video store as it opened on May 12th.

Maybe my expectations were too high but the hype and the incredible trailer did not live up to the film itself.  It wasn't so much a film about the bridge or even about the jumpers but about the people that knew the jumpers.  It offered no real insight into the bottomless topic of suicide.  The HBO documentary called Suicide is extremely compelling and haunting but this just didn't have the sense of despair it should.  Yes, the footage of the people on the railing, those who jumped and almost jumped were quite striking.  For that alone I recommend the film.  Yet more background would have enhanced this movie.  Like doctors, security officers who work the bridge, the writings or drawings of the suicidal, something else to give The Bridge more dimension.  And what ever happened to the girl who was rescued?  I would have loved to hear the aftermath.

Suicide is a great topic and, as Camus said, ""The only true philosophical problem.""  In  some way, The Bridge just didn't have that gut wrenching sorrow that it really needed.  As well, on the special features, I thought having Kevin ""what's his name"" (the survivor) talk about getting help and showing the suicide hotline number was tacky at best.

2791600,5,B000O76PXK,"_The Bridge_ was inspired by a 2003 New Yorker article called ""Jumpers"" by Tad Friend.

The most disturbing, and the most controversial, aspect of the film is that you witness actual suicides as they take place. Steel was able to capture nearly all the suicides that took place in 2004 by setting up cameras and letting them run. Steel then interviewed friends and family members of people who jumped. What emerges is a story about intense pain and desperation, people who felt they were somehow on the outside of life. What also emerges is a story about the rest of us who really don't want to know about such things because they bring us pain.

It's been nearly week since I saw the film, and I'm still haunted by the images, the people. I can't shake the thought that I witnessed their last act. One of them was a young man named Gene. I keep seeing him in my mind's eye, walking up and down the railing, his long black hair flying in the wind, waiting, searching, for the right moment to jump.

This, of course, is Eric Steel's intent: I'm not supposed to be able to shake the images. I'm supposed to be disturbed by them.

Watching, I thought of W.H. Auden's poem, ""Musee des Beaux Arts"":

About suffering they were never wrong,
The Old Masters; how well, they understood
Its human position; how it takes place
While someone else is eating or opening
a window or just walking dully along;
How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting
For the miraculous birth, there always must be
Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating
On a pond at the edge of the wood:
They never forgot
That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course
Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot
Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse
Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.
In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away
Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

1940

Steel wants viewers to make the connection to Auden's poem, I think.  The spirit of the poem is suggested in the imagery several times.  Steel shows us that suffering takes place all around us. Yet we don't notice because we have ""somewhere to get to."" We sail ""calmly on.""

If you're looking for light entertainment or factual documentary, this film is not for you.  I love dark themes and thought-provoking material, and I don't think anything else I've ever seen matches the intensity of this film.  _The Bridge_ will encourage viewers to think deeply about artistic and social responsibility.

For example, the section on Kevin Hines, who survived a plunge from the bridge, really begins to drag on and on long after the relevant points have been made.

'The Bridge' might have been strengthened by talking with some of the bridge workers or Coast Guard in order to round out the whole experience of Golden Gate jumpers.

On the plus side, the cinematography is great.  As I understand it, the produced used off-the-street local camera talent....which says something about how fertile a place SanFran is for the arts.  Also, the narrative leading up to a couple of jumpers works well....sure wish he had been able to interview Gene Sprague's mother.

Great dramatic effect created by interspersing cuts of various people which leaves you guessing which one will go over the rail.

Suicide of any kind is never an easy subject to talk about let alone make a film about.  I give Eric Steel 10 out of 10 for this very poignant work and Alex Heffes the same for his haunting piano score that weaves effortlessly throughout the film.",1182729600,5,639,4.389830508474576
2791604,5,B000O76PXK,"One of the pure joys (a word I use intentionally considering its disturbing connotations in this context) of the documentary is the element of challenge--to undertake a concept that brings up more questions than answers, more complexity than simplicity.  When the proper challenge is identified, it is the talented film maker who explores rather than concludes, who looks for the range of possibility and concern, the mirror of real life if you will, rather than find an oversimplified answer to everything.

And this is where this film succeeds immensely.

The Golden Gate Bridge is evidently one of the most popular spots for suicide in the world.  In 2004, when this film was shot, 24 people threw themselves from it.  And Eric Steel, shooting the bridge from various angles during this year, caught several of those suicides.

There is an ethical discussion to be had about the premise of the film alone, an effort to capture suicides on film rather than prevent them from happening.  But Steel's handling of these events is far more human and considerate than the manipulative handling of so-called reality shows, where the people are but spectacles who can be maneuvered and edited in any which way to get a pre-desired end.  Steel takes these suicides and studies them by talking to the deceased's relatives and friends, or people who witnessed the event, to look at not only the impact of suicide and mental illness, but also the effects of relationships, of living through the day-to-day and not wanting (or not expecting) such events of drama in their lives.

The ranges of attitudes regarding mental illness alone are well worth watching this movie for.  From a couple of kiters who are so into their sport that they cannot relate at all to a person's desire to hurl himself to his own death, to parents who have to live with the fact that their own son will most likely find a way to kill himself (and eventually does).  People who live with regret for their own actions (or lack thereof) or anger at a loved one for leaving them in that way.  The suicides in this film are not presented in any way to glorify them.  Instead, each and every person who jumps (or who attempts to jump) comes across as scared and confused.  The jumper who survives his attempt describes it best when he says how he was determined to die until his hands actually let go of the rail, at which point he knew that he didn't want to die anymore.  Every jumper in this film comes across as a frightened and confused person, even a guy who seems to be talking almost casually on a phone before he climbs up onto a rail, crosses himself and goes.

The story of Gene, the thread that is carried through the movie as we see a man in black with a long mop of curly hair pace back and forth along the bridge as though either looking for the right spot or trying to convince himself to finally go through with it, is probably the most compelling for the essence of painful tragedy involved.  His death caps off the film perfectly--it is both sad and shocking, and definitely a punch in the gut.  Steel takes a highly difficult subject that many people should be enraged and shocked by, and he treats it more as a story of the survivors and our own confusion towards this compulsion and determination.  Alas, these are human beings after all, so we are compelled to find some way to cope with the fact that our own can be so flawed.",1182470400,96,3411,4.589785831960461
2791605,2,B000O76PXK,"I have mixed feelings about this documentary.  If they end up using it to convince San Francisco to stop letting anyone walk or bike over the bridge, erect suicide barriers or have security all over the bridge, then add a star.  Having the one guy who survived the jump might be a good story to scare someone from doing it.  But is this a dvd you want to buy? In a way this is part snuff film, part documentary. The reason a lot of people will want to see this is out of morbid curiosity to see people jump. The same reason they rent Faces of Death. I rented it and watched it tonight and it was extremely difficult to watch, especially to see the first person jump. I yelled in horror when I saw it. And I've seen everything. Those of you saying that ""everyone"" should watch this film are out of your minds.  There is a reason that suicides are usually not reported on.  The reason is that everytime the media does so others follow suit.  That is my main reason for giving this a low rating.  That and the fact that it is so depressing to watch and you are not going to want to see it a second time so why buy it?  If you have to see it, rent it. Or go to the arthouse cinema. But if you do find it playing somewhere- trust me - don't bring a date.

I am not equating the work here from a cinematic perspective to Faces of Death (or it's sequels and spin-offs) and I do not believe that the director and crew made this with bad intentions. But I felt the need to inject some reality into the reviews here with all of these critics telling everyone to feed the cat and run out and buy this.  I'm just saying that this is not The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill, i.e. something meant for all viewers.
