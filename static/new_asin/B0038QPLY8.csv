The stories need to be faster, more intense and told in a way that will make everyone understand what is happening. It is thus necessary to contrive plot elements to get the story going. A story without plot is not a story; it's a documentary. A great film has to make a contribution to the development of the medium. And it has to have lasting importance. A great film must strike a chord with viewers no matter how much time has passed since it was made. The story has to be compelling and interesting. I think story and content are very important in a great film. Also interesting characters make a good film. I did not get anything from this movie, besides some comic book writer who created an image of a super hero. I thought the movie was going to be base on some sort of action heros according to the synopsis. Very disappointing!!",1401408000,,1011,4.622222222222222

The story is well told and touching. The ending in a word, UNFORGETTABLE. This is one of those rare movies that stays with you long after it's over.",1305417600,2,312,4.216666666666667
