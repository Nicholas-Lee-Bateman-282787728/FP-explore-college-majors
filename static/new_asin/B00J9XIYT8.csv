8649159,5,B00J9XIYT8,"Considering the year it was made, the story is just Good, but the real Star, for me, was the Hughes H1.  That aircraft has long been a favorite of that era and all time. It should have gotten a spot on the marque. Loved it.",1475020800,,223,3.9555555555555557
8649160,4,B00J9XIYT8,"Unusual ensemble performance as attention shifts back and forth between pilot, sister, chief engineer and plant owner.

Richard Dix makes an inside joke at the bar refering to a previous film Ace Of Aces.

The drunk pilot maybe giving rides in a Verville ST.  His sister takes over the controls of a Stinson Reliant. Lots of actual and model footage of the Hughes racer, with registration numbers doctored up twice. The sober rescue is made in a Ryan ST.",1463616000,,454,4.7215189873417724
8649161,5,B00J9XIYT8,"Excellent quality... beautiful footage of the Hughes H-1 racer that is used as the ""Prototype"" military aircraft being designed, constructed and flight tested!  It is well worth the price of admission for the scenes of the H-1 flying!  The story is typical of the era.  I highly recommend for those that appreciate the beauty of the H-1 and the clarity of the production!",1420416000,,371,4.857142857142857
