8527336,4,B008FLRYUA,"I loved this movie.  Interesting look into the mind of one of my favorite comics writers... actually now just one of my favorite writers.  Not to be taken too seriously, not too heavy handed.  Just a light look at the workings and process of the man.  Lots that I didn't know, but piqued my curiosity even more.  Plus lots of interviews with many other comic creators.  I'm not sure how this would play with the non comics fan, but I like it.",1369699200,3,442,4.329268292682927
