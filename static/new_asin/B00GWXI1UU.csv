6122467,5,B00GWXI1UU,"DEAD POINT, adaptation feature-length TV mystery is based on a contemporary novel by Peter Temple. Good news: Temple continues to write the books, thus hopefully more of this series to come. Jack Irish, ex-lawyer turned PI and woodworker, is played by award winning Guy Pearce (King's Speech).
In this ""Dead Point"" episode Judge Loder (Barry Humphries) is about to release a dockyard criminal report and asks his son-in-law Jack to find an incriminating red book. That's just the beginning of a waterfront conspiracy with unknown involvement that includes drugs, violence, corruption in the force, theft, gambling, murder, and blackmail. A full-meal-deal in crime investigation for down under, Aussie style.

Gritty, course, and complicated. Adult fare that's hard to watch at times, het you get glued to the screen compulsively. Blimey captivating, with Melbourne's beauties and beasts.
On the personal front, even though Irish yet grieves for his dead wife Isabel, he's romantically involved with a blonde radio talk programmer, Linda (Marta Dusseldorp). She was also in previous Jack Irish Set 1 DVD episodes: ""Black Tide"" & ""Bad Debts"".
Jack toughs it out through all the action and suspense long enough to show his softer side as he becomes ""Uncle Jack.""
SDH SUBTITLES available for the feature and bonus Behind the Scenes: The Docks, Traffic Jam, Air Strip Finale, Photos.
This set 2 comes as combo DVD + Blu-ray. Now hopefully someone has both players and can give an opinion as to the visual comparison.",1397520000,7,1511,5.192622950819672

6122577,4,B00GWXI1UU,"Last year I discovered this Australian Broadcasting series based on a series of novelist Peter Temple. I like the series mainly because of the central character played by Guy Pearce.  Though I got this Set 2  Its not really a second series or season because it is only one 87-minute episode  I just got to watch it this week. It had been a while since I watched Set 1 which had two 90-minute episodes but I was able to pick up most of the plot easily. I had forgotten that he was involved in horse racing gambling or that he wife was murdered at the BEGINNING of Set 1, but much of this came back to me.

Honestly I didn't think the plot this time was as good as the first Set but Peace is always fun to watch. Australian actor Barry Humphries has a fairly big role as a possibly- corrupt judge and most Americans will know him better with a different set of clothes as the comic character Dame Edna.  Speaking of closes, Australian TV is more liberal that US networks so there are scenes of nudity and the S-word gets a pretty fair amount of use.

As with the \first Set I felt I needed the English subtitles (added by RLJ in nice easy to read test) and they did prove helpful.

The Bluray combo pack comes with minimal bonus features. There are three behind the scenes featurettes with the Director on how the action scenes were show. They run about 2  minutes each. And there is a photo gallery that ;plays for just under two-minutes. Important note: Do not watch the Special Features until you've see the film. There are many spoilers in the bonuses.

The show is worth watching  especially if you saw Set 1  but, like most of the others here  I have to admit this is not as good as many other crime series from RLJ and Acorn.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I just finished watching Jack Irish, Set 2 and while I enjoyed the show, it lacked the freshness of the first two. Jack is a bit timid, which surprised me, because I do not remember that quality in the first two episodes. Speaking of episodes, there is only one episode in this ""set"". Even at the price of $19.99, I felt overcharged.
The quality and production value of the show remains high and there are really good scenes. Pearce is a very fine actor, but as a series, the writers are going to have to do better and the producers are going to have to give their international market a better value. No more pre-ordering for me. I'll be patient and see what the product is.
If you've invested in the first set, you'll probably want to pick this up, but do not pay full price.

6122604,5,B00GWXI1UU,"In JACK IRISH: DEAD POINT, we have a third feature-length entry in a recent Australian television series of noir mysteries, based on Australian author Peter Temple's celebrated award winning crime novels. The series stars  Emmy winner Guy Pearce (THE KING'S SPEECH, MEMENTO, IRON MAN 3) in the title role, as a former lawyer, part-time private investigator, full-time alcoholic and brooding antihero. The series, made by Australian firms, is set, and apparently filmed, in the rougher precincts of Melbourne, Australia, certainly part of the world that few of us will have seen. It was a ratings winner in the U.K. and Australia; I believe that, in addition to the first series, one more feature length installment is still in the works. The current entry, DEAD POINT, is available in streaming format or in a box set, running approximately 87 minutes, for mature audiences, as it contains strong language, violence, graphic images, nudity and sexual situations.  And, oddly enough, though it says it doesn't have subtitles, it does, thank you, RLJ Entertainment; however else would us Americans ever understand the Australian lingo - and no, I didn't catch a single `let's throw the shrimp on the barbie.'

In the current entry, Justice Logan, a crusading high court judge played by Barry Humphries, is about to deliver his bombshell report on a criminal dockyard operation.  The Judge, who is Jack's father-in-law, insofar as he was the father of Jack's murdered wife,  requests Jack's help locating  sensitive materials in a red-bound book.  Marta Dusseldorp, who played Jack's love interest, sharp-tongued journalist Linda Hillier in previous episodes, shares her beauty with us again.  Vadin Glowna, who did excellent work playing the old German cabinet maker Charlie, does not appear in this episode, though his workshop does.  Most of the fine supporting players from the first series return: Jack's colleagues at the horse track; the aging football fans watching reruns of 20-year old games every afternoon at the pub.  And the full length allotment allows time for character development, even backstory, while camera and cast give us the life of  Melbourne.

Seemed to me that, like the previous episodes, the plot of the episode was somewhat dated, and spoke of the 1990s. Still, the plot is satisfyingly complex,  and Melbourne is a flavorful setting for these suspenseful shows. Pearce inhabits the title role stunningly and manfully, playing another of the damaged detectives so popular today, as he carries the high-voltage series on his well-defined shoulders. (He is, of course, also delineated as a cool guy, with his vintage Studebaker, his Johnnie Walker, and his cool jazz.)  I never imagined he could play a role like this after the first film I ever saw him in.  THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT, in which the actor portrayed a tall, well-muscled, handsome, gay female impersonator, child of a rich family and spoiled rotten, so well that, at the time, I doubted he could ever play anything else. Then I saw him in LA CONFIDENTIAL.

Once saw Barry Humphries live, long ago, on New York's Broadway, as he played his popular comic alter-ego, Dame Edna Everidge.  At the end of the show, he routinely asked questions of members of the audience and responded to their answers.  One particular interchange I'm never likely to forget: he asked a female senior to describe her day.  She woke up about 10 A.M., she said, went to the door, and schlepped the fat New York Times - and it is almost always fat -- back to the breakfast table, where she digested it over her cereal.  That sounded like a good day to him, he said, and I thought so too.  It's what I want when I retire, I thought.  Hasn't worked out that way.  Oh, well.

Still, we love this series in this house.  Couldn't wait to see this episode, panting for the next.",1401494400,9,3860,4.956521739130435
6122605,1,B00GWXI1UU,"This third episode is a misfire, stranding Pearce without anything substantial to work with, bungling the show's tension, and capping it all off with an awful finish. Beyond that, this Blu-Ray only offers half the value of the first, serving up a single episode for the same price as the first two.",1400371200,6,298,4.75
6122606,5,B00GWXI1UU,"There are so many police/detective/mystery programs filling the airwaves today that it really takes something special to stand out. JACK IRISH is one of those shows that manages to do precisely that.

A large part of the show's success is the luminescence of the star, Guy Pearce, who is a wonderful choice to play Jack. Pearce inhabits Irish and makes him alternately vulnerable, resourceful and heroic, providing the perfect moral centre that is necessary when the story revolves around deceit, blackmail and murder. Too often in shows that feature a troubled, flawed protagonist, there just isn't a lot to like about them. In typical, iconoclastic fashion, the thinking in these cases is that the main character can be thoroughly unappealing, provided the ""bad guys"" are worse. Thus the audience will still root for him, since it is human nature when it comes to our response to drama to desire relative good to triumph over evil.

Fortunately, Jack Irish is more than that. He is actually a really decent bloke who has experienced the terrible tragedy of seeing his wife murdered practically before his eyes. Irish is mired in the nightmare of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder but he is not wallowing in it. He's trying. And that alone makes him worth cheering for.

Feature-length programs like JACK IRISH also benefit when they are drawn from a literary source, namely a novel (as is the case with the JACK IRISH series). Plots are more dense, characters more well-defined and psychological insight is deeper when the origins are in prose, not drama.

What I especially love about JACK IRISH is the range of colourful supporting characters. Even Jack's wood furniture-making mentor, Charlie Taub, is mentioned in this latest episode, even though the actor who played him, German actor Vadim Glowna, died in 2012. Jack, who practices this craft to escape from the world and unwind, wonders why Taub has been away for so long, and if he has maybe, like an elephant, ""gone home to die"". It's a nice touch, respectful of the fact that the many contributions of the supporting cast are a vital part of the show's appeal.

Other standout regular supporting players are Roy Billing as horse race-loving Harry Strang, a frequent collaborator of Jack's; and Aaron Pedersen as Cam, Billing's bodyguard, whose fearless approach to every confrontation is a treat to watch. His interrogation of a particularly nasty bad guy in this episode, using a construction crane, is especially fun.

But the absolute revelation in the acting department in this episode of JACK IRISH is the performance by Barry Humphries as Jack's former father-in-law. Humphries, better known as Dame Edna Everage, the female character he created in the late 1950s, is a wonderful actor and when he plays a straight dramatic role, as he does here, his achievements as Dame Edna, are all the more remarkable. For the uninitiated, Dame Edna is a fictitious character whose life story has been entirely created by Humphries. Dame Edna refers to Humphries as her ""entrepeneur"" or manager. Humphries and his staff of assistants and writers only refer to Edna as ""her"" or ""she"" and thereby never mix the character with Humphries himself. It is thought this precision and richness of identity give Dame Edna her unique force as a character. Amazing.

The fast-paced story in this episode of JACK IRISH has a number of terrific twists and turns and builds to a climax that is dependent on Jack's car having cruise control. No spoilers here: you'll see what I mean when you watch it.

The producers of JACK IRISH are planning on adapting the fourth novel in the series by author Peter Temple and have optioned a fifth book, which Temple is currently writing. Take your time, lads. Get it right. JACK IRISH is worth waiting for.",1400284800,13,3782,4.94488188976378
