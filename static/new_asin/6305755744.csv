7893909,3,6305755744,"I've stuck with Silent Mobius this far, and have to say it's not enthralling me with its concatenation of cliches.  From the ""oh my gosh, we're crashing into the most dangerous part of town that no one ever escapes from!"" to ""Gee, we might fight the demons better if we  all got together as a team!"", the story line would be commendable as a  high school project for anime amateurs, but asking me to blow the money for this  volume of unimaginative mediocrity is a little much.  As I'd said in my  previous review, this is more a rehash of Eva than a bold, new series.  Save yourself the money, rent it, watch it the one time you'll watch it in  your life, and move on to something more mentally stimulating.  You'll be  glad you did.",957744000,,734,4.330882352941177
