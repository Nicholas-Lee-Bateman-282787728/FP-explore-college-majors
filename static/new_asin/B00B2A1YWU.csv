5552946,1,B00B2A1YWU,Watched it and thought it was boring. Not much cooking involved. Time spent between family and the restaurant. Kept waiting for some outstanding cooking and presentation but there is very little of both in this film.,1367798400,4,216,5.027777777777778

8561283,5,B00B2A1YWU,"I am a professional and I thought it a great attempt to explore culinary history within one family.  Cinematography great but if you are expecting a film all about food, this will not measure up in that regard.  But over all an excellent filmography.",1424563200,,250,4.659090909090909
8561284,1,B00B2A1YWU,"Unless you know these people personally, there is no point in watching this relentlessly boring, bland, beige snoozer.  Even the food segments were unbearable.  Fussy, overly precious preparation of dishes that were absurd in their lack of appeal, done in complete SILENCE.  I got so irritated, I started blurting out phrases like ""Are you kidding me?!""  ""Is this some kind of a joke?"" and ""You couldn't pay me to eat that B.S."".  The best looking food in the whole thing were the cheese and jam sandwiches the woman made at the very end of the film.  What a waste of my time.",1423267200,2,576,4.598039215686274

8561286,2,B00B2A1YWU,"I think it was Jean Luc Godard who said he wanted to make a movie about the space between people.  This is a documentary about the space around a subject.  It is good effort at originality, but originality doesn't entertain or inform by itself.

On the plus side, the director spared us the usual tiresome foodie clichs:  Food porn, people going into orgasmic eye rolls over some desert, or other common devices.  Unfortunately, he has nothing to put in place of the worn out ideas.  We get a very quiet look into the lives of a father and son chef team that isn't very interesting and doesn't get very deep.

I came away thinking it was a wasted opportunity to do an original food documentary.",1407456000,2,694,4.504
8561287,5,B00B2A1YWU,"Never having working in a family business, let alone shared my kitchen professional with my family I cannot understand parts of the exchanged, but this moves shares the difficulty that I have experienced many times in the handing or taking over the reins in restaurant",1384300800,,268,4.977777777777778
8561288,5,B00B2A1YWU,"Michel Bras is a master, and turning his restaurant over to son Sebastian is a huge leap. This film provides a real look at the people behind the restaurant and captures the intensity and dedication of both men (and their colleagues). The outtakes/extra footage provided is absolutely worth viewing (they take up as mach time as the finished film) as they take you even deeper into what makes this one of the most respected restaurants in the world.",1375747200,2,449,4.769230769230769
8561289,5,B00B2A1YWU,"While there was plenty of culinary eye candy, especially with the creation of some signature dishes such as the ""Gargouillou"", this was more about the relationship between father and son during the transition of the Bras restaurants.  One obviously conjures up ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" which offers a interesting contrast with this film for the food and relationship.  Ironically some of this film is devoted to the Bras restaurant in Japan.",1368835200,,439,5.169014084507042
