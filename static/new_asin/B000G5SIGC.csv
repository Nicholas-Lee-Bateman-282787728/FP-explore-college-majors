8128888,4,B000G5SIGC,"Even though it has some scary scenes for a 3 year old -which we skipped, of course- it really had us glued to the screen to the end. The image quality is horrible but some of the scenes are hysterical and the story has so many original twists that make the DVD worth buying. It has chase scenes James Bond style and music that ranges from Wagner to Rock-and-roll.
My son asked to watch it more than 10 days in a row!
There is some name-calling I don't care about but, in general, is a fun movie worth to buy even if it's only to practice your Spanish.",1193011200,,551,4.111111111111111
