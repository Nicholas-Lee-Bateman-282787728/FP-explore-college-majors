3172507,3,B0017I8NKI,This has a great deal of good information but I wish that the music was better...the sitar is too loud for meditation.  It should also be more professionally put together.,1268524800,,171,4.7
3172508,5,B0017I8NKI,"This is a really zen yoga. The voice is very nice and you feel immediatly calm and zen with this dvd. Many many options, you get many things for your purchase",1244332800,,158,4.129032258064516
3172509,4,B0017I8NKI,"I love this dvd, the sequences are soothing and restorative, however, be careful of the Reclining Hero pose.  It compresses the lower disks - don't try it if you've ever had lower back problems.",1231372800,9,194,4.705882352941177
3172510,1,B0017I8NKI,"This item has two irreconcilable flaws, the first and foremost being that the tracks don't play properly. This DVD is in fact NOT A DVD. It's a DVD-R, meaning that the contents were copied not pressed like most commercial DVDs. However the product was manufactured, it doesn't work properly. I returned the first copy and received a second and that one had even more tracks that wouldn't play. So, until the maker of this item improves their manufacturing, this item is not worth your time and money.

The second flaw involves the actual content. The idea of yoga prescriptions for ailments is awesome, very Eastern and prevention-minded. However, the prescriptions comprise of a combination of mini-tracks for each move. So, for example, after they show down-dog, the screen blackens and seconds later loads the next move. It makes for a pretty disjointed session. There are no transitions. I prefer a more ""flowy"" or kata-like routines. However, this is restorative yoga, so it probably was meant to be this way.

The video also does not go into a lot of detail to make sure you're doing the moves right, so I would not recommend such a program to a beginner.",1230940800,7,1161,4.8291457286432165
3172511,5,B0017I8NKI,"This comprehensive yoga DVD offers an extensive selection of yoga sequences for many different conditions, from physical issues as diverse as acne, asthma, high blood pressure, and menopause to mental health problems such as anorexia and bulimia, depression, and alcoholism, to more common concerns including colds, indigestion, mental or physical fatigue, and stress.  (A complete list of all sequences can be found on the web site MyYogaVideo.com; the practices range from 30 to almost 90 minutes, not 20 to 70 minutes as incorrectly stated on the DVD case.)

Each yoga asana (posture) on this DVD is filmed as an discrete, stand-alone chapter, complete with on-screen information about benefits and contraindications of the pose.  These individual postures are then arranged in varying combinations to form the many different practices available.  Instructor Laura Hawes leads a small class of four outdoor participants via voiceover.  The majority of the poses are restorative in nature, and given this, many props are used, including one or more bolsters, blankets, and a yoga strap; a few of the practices include brief holds of more challenging postures such as inversions and backbends.  Every practice on the DVD ends with the nice, extended Savasana segment (7 minutes).

For experienced yogis who are looking for a video which offers them a large number of options, particularly for longer practices, this DVD may be ideal.  However, this DVD is not appropriate for those who are new to yoga, as Hawes does not provide enough detailed information about form and alignment (although various levels of modifications are shown).  But Yoga Therapy Prescriptions clearly has much to offer the continuing yoga student, and I would definitely recommend it.",1229472000,9,1760,5.3478260869565215

3172513,5,B0017I8NKI,"There is my new favorite yoga dvd! I was looking for a yoga practice that was more restorative than workout and this is it.

This dvd consists of numerous sequences that address a variety of ailments and conditions.  There is so much variety, both within each sequence and each pose that there is truly something for everyone.  I love how 4 examples of each pose are demonstrated, from the most gentle, supported and relaxing variation to more advanced and vigorous variations.  The setting is gorgeous and the music is relaxing and peaceful. Laura's voice is soothing and never intrusive.

I know that this dvd will be a regular part of my yoga practice for years to come.",1221264000,13,673,4.717948717948718
3172514,5,B0017I8NKI,This is a great video - well done and is very useful for me. There are days when I know I should do some yoga but I don't want to go down and take a long class. I can scroll to a section that looks interesting and follow at my own pace. I think this is a great way for someone to familiarize themselves with the basics of yoga used for therapeutic purposes as well as an easy way to get more yoga done at home.

8266063,4,B0017I8NKI,"excellent video, pace is slow so there is time to follow along with the programs, multiple video for different conditions, but seem repetive with the same poses use for all conditions, however I am new to yoga and it is  great way to start",1448150400,,239,4.431818181818182
8266064,3,B0017I8NKI,"I bought this recently as I was looking for a beginning yoga video, something that you turn on & follow through the motions. Basically I want a yoga class in my living room. This video stops & starts constantly. Yes there are tons of different poses but I didn't know it wasn't flowing. After you finish one pose the next one comes up & then you have to read what's written on the screen & what it's good for. Then you do the pose. Same thing, over & over. I even flipped it to the 30 min workout, same thing, stop & start. I am going to have to buy another video. Another thing that is really annoying is you look up to see if you're doing it right & everyone is doing something different. The sitar music gets so strong in some places that you can't even hear the narration.
Something else that I didn't realize was happening is not everything plays. I wanted to do the fitness 30 min & up on the screen the title says yoga for fitness (30 min) & then it says fitness yoga for fitness (45 min) then goes on to yoga for fitness (60 min). Nothing ever plays! I don't have a brand new dvd player, maybe that's the problem in reading all the other posts about the chapters not playing. Just keep it in mind.",1432771200,,1205,4.153846153846154
8266065,5,B0017I8NKI,Thank you Laura Hawes!  Amazing the sequence of poses can be so healing:),1414627200,,73,4.615384615384615

8266067,5,B0017I8NKI,"I adore this DVD set. I have chronic migraines, cervical dystonia, fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (and other things, but I don't want to turn this review into the War & Peace edition of ways my body malfunctions) so exercising is very challenging. Exercise is recommended for fibro and encouraged in a limited, safe way for people with CFS and migraine. Avoiding triggering symptoms or relapses is also very important for migraine and CFS.
Many of the routines are excellent for gentle stretching and movement and work well in either alleviating some pain or at least refocusing your attention away from pain.
I typically use the Migraine sequence. You can very easily skip poses you cannot or don't wish to to.
Laura has a soothing, easy to understand voice and discusses the name of each pose and the purpose.
Best of all there are many, many suggestions for modifying poses for comfort using blankets, bolsters, etc.  A group of people is shown from multiple angles, each of them adopting a modified version of the pose in demonstration.
The music is Indian and complements the practice nicely.

Some DVD players may have trouble with the disks. Mine works fine in a regular DVD player, my MacBook, and in a PS3 but not in our Wii.
The disks are set up with each pose as a different track. The routines play the prescribed tracks based on your selection - like a playlist. You can chose from a very long list of routines - migraine, depression, back pain, fatigue, arthritis, etc.",1384214400,4,1494,4.786821705426356
8266068,3,B0017I8NKI,"I ordered this DVD is search for some help with lower back issues I have been having. When I saw the extensive list of ailments listed on the DVD, I thought this would be great, yoga for any ailment one may have. I have only done a couple of the routines, but I am not that impressed. It has already made it to the stack of DVDs that never get watched.",1371513600,,352,3.971830985915493
8266069,5,B0017I8NKI,"I love this DVD. It offers great variety. You can choose your own level and the practice.
