Also most spotlight the individual(s) that worked behind the scenes at NASA back then... people you wouldn't even have thought of  but that without them, the astronaunts would not have gone up!  Again,EXCELLENT!!!!!",912988800,,300,5.456521739130435
42198,5,0783114222,I think is the best DVD collection I have seen and the multiple languages are great incentive to buy it. The fourth CD has excellent additional materials like the interactive tour of our solar system in which i learned  a lot I already forgot from school!,912038400,,255,4.543478260869565
42199,5,0783114222,"The writing, acting and production values are all superb. Each episode was as entertaining as a feature film. From the Earth to the Moon was based on a book entitled ""A Man on the Moon"" by Andrew Chakin - and that  book is one of finest pieces of literature I have read. Chakin is a great  story teller, and this series is on the same level as the book! I told my  wife when we watched the series back in May that Hanks was a shoe in for  the Emmy on this one- and sure enough he won.",911952000,,484,3.9081632653061225

42258,5,0783114222,"I saw this series once and was quite impressed.  I decided to buy it after seeing clips on the internet and I was reminded just how excellent an achievement this series is ever after a few years have passed.

Once Howard, Hanks and company decided to make this series, the excellence of both technical achievement and artistic achievement is quite high.  There are some moments here expressing not just the achievements of getting into space, but capturing the human spirit of the grand adventure which are simply sublime.  The moment at the end of Episode 1 capturing Aldrin as he looks to the moon may be one of the best scenes I have ever seen filmed for capturing a moment - put brilliance frankly.

Given the Right Stuff covered the Mercury program and Apollo 13 covered a lot of territory, the series focuses in on other important but not observed aspects of this grand story.  At turns whimsical, serious (the aftermath of the Apollo 1 fire), artistic and comedic (the Apollo 12 comedy tour), this is just excellent television.  This covers both personal aspects of missions with familiar faces and the moments of anxiety facing entire missions.  In so many ways Apollo 17 lifted off Taurus-Littrow and as is typical of Americans, we put the incredible achievement of Apollo in our collective back pockets and never really looked back. Before Apollo 13 came out in 1994, there had not been any movies specifically about Apollo since the early 1970's (does Capricorn One count?).  Watching this and reading a number of books about the Apollo program, this is just a reminder of the awesome collective will of the American people.  Individual achievement, but collective effort.  Stunning.

Highly recommended.",1496620800,3,1715,4.937282229965157

42292,5,0783114222,Loved it,1485734400,,8,3.5
42293,3,0783114222,"The series was well photographed. There were lots of details that I missed as a 7 year old kid when Shepard made his 15 minute flight. So the series helped to fill in lots of blanks for me. But I have to wonder how accurately the history is being presented here. In Episode 12 about Apollo 17, there's a video segment that was staged as having been made on the surface of the moon by one of the astronauts. It hilariously shows the earth rising in the sky. Of course, if you're standing on the moon looking up at the earth, the earth cannot appear to rise in the sky, as the moon appears to rise when viewed from the surface of the earth. This is obviously the case since the moon is rotating on its axis at the same rate that it orbits the earth, and so the surface of the moon facing the earth never changes. How they managed to miss this is beyond me. It makes you wonder how many other things they got wrong.

Other than the bit about a rather immature Buzz Aldrin making a fuss over not being picked as the very first man to step on the moon, all the astronauts and NASA staff are portrayed as absolutely perfect, so warm and cuddly you just want to hug them. Hardly realistic. And that gets old pretty fast.",1485648000,,1213,4.183760683760684
42294,5,0783114222,I haven't actually seen this. My husband ordered it and enjoyed it so much he's planning on passing it on to other family members who share like interests.,1484784000,,155,4.571428571428571
42295,5,0783114222,"Great series.  I watched it on HBO when it came out and loved it; bought it used on Amazon recently (great price, even with shipping fee), received it somewhat quickly (earlier than their estimate in an email), it was in perfect condition (no disc glitches); watched the whole series again over a few days and loved it again, as did my girlfriend; I let my brother-in-law borrow it and he watched the first 7 episodes/hours in 1 day (musta liked it).

The series brings so many things to life and shows how big a deal this was, how significant, how historic: President Kennedy's speech, others' ideas, planning, selecting the astronauts, training, hard work, commitment, bravery, perseverance, math/science/engineering, tragedy, near-tragedy,  the humanity and emotions and friendships, etc., and much more.

Sadly, Gene Cernan, who was featured in the last episode and was the last man to walk on the moon (Apollo 17, December 1972) died 2 days ago [01/16/2017, the same day my brother-in-law watched 7 episodes].",1484697600,3,1014,5.090361445783133

42298,5,0783114222,"One of my favorite TV series.  Grand, inspiring, riveting and insightful, the sort of tour-de-force that going to the moon actually deserves.  It captures the grand ambitions of the times and the people, while showing some of the controversy and tarnish that was there behinds the scenes (not all of it, but enough to ensure it's not just a blind tribute).  The sort of series that I can watch with my kids and we are all awed by the magnificence of the achievement of it.",1483660800,3,472,4.529411764705882

42300,5,0783114222,"The disks came to me in excellent condition, as advertised. They're like new and I'm really happy with their physical condition. The packaging shows a little wear but the set is eighteen years old and I'm not concerned about it. I loved this show when HBO first put it on the air and thought about it often but never saw it on TV again. When I buy something like this it's because I know I'll watch it again and again, over time, so I was happy to have the chance to add this set to my video library. The episodes are each great stories and I feel lucky to have found a set released in the original 1998 format as opposed to the later releases which are expanded to wide screen for modern TVs but at the sacrifice of losing the top and bottom of the films, a great loss when you really want to see the entire vista of the space shots and views over the Earth. A great product and a great buy from this seller.",1480636800,5,909,4.112359550561798

42307,5,0783114222,"Like many other reviewers, this is way about 5 stars.  The series is reviewed excellently elsewhere.  I  old enough to remember everything from Sputnik to the final Apollo flight.  My daughter often ask me ""What were the sixties really like.""

I am writing for this reason.  I am proposing that this series be offered as an elective in Junior and High schools.  What an excellent way to inspire younger generations to pursue engineering and the sciences.  It also touches on solid family values. It also makes clear to a younger generation what it means when someone says ""Let's make America great again"".",1475884800,2,605,4.862745098039215

42311,5,0783114222,"For a techie (former aerospace engineer) like me, this book is like reliving my days at the Cape during the height of the manned space program (and height of the DoD launches as well).  There are lots of acronyms (explained thankfully), and lots of drama surrounding the highly precise, yet ""seat of the pants"" engineering done during those ""get er done by 1969"" days.  A non-technical person probably would not enjoy this book, but I could be wrong.  However, anyone interested in getting inside mission control and getting to know the men who rose to the occasion will find this book riveting.  The epitome of the ""rocket scientist"" is portrayed by the ""SCE to Aux"" incident on Apollo 12.  John Aaron saved the mission and the lives of the astronauts by his quick recollection and suggestion to turn the SCE switch to Auxilliary to recover the space craft from a dual lightening strike on the vehicle.

I grew up in Cocoa Beach and watched all the launches (some over my shoulder while mowing the lawn as a kid).  I thought the astronauts were cool.  But the guys wearing the headsets at launch control were more intriguing.  I was able to become one of them, first in shuttle launch control, then in DoD launches.  I never understood why they moved mission control to Houston (other than for political reasons).  But this book gives a great picture of what took place at the mission control.  I now have a better appreciation for the efforts in Houston.

Buy and read the book.  Great history.  And great writing even.",1472169600,4,1521,4.686792452830189

42413,3,0783114222,"Certainly, the accomplishments of the space program make Americans very proud. But a TV mini-series devoted to the subject didn't need endless flag-waving and a soundtrack that sounds like a slanted World War II movie from the 1950's and early 1960's to make its point. (One episode actually uses the theme music from ""The Great Escape""!) ""From the Earth to the Moon"" is a bit over-the-top in the patriotic department and a little under-done in the real behind-the-scenes drama department. The United States' project to send a man to the moon and return him to the earth, which was originally proposed by John F. Kennedy, was full of glitches, setbacks, wrong-turns, conflicts, and clashes. A few these behind-the-scenes darker aspects were portrayed but not nearly as many as actually occurred. Unfortunately, the filmmakers glossed up the positive aspects and left out a lot of the darker albeit more interesting aspects of this incredible venture.

The made-for-television mini-series comes off more like a NASA press conference or a tour for fifth-graders at a museum than a stark honest depiction of the actual events leading up to the first moon missions. ""From the Earth to the Moon"" depicted very little conflict between any of the personalities, the technological setbacks, the political controversies, and the many mishaps that are inevitable from such an undertaking. Some were hinted at, such as the decision concerning who would be the first man to walk on the moon but I wanted to see more of the arguments, the setbacks, the conflicts. These more negative aspects were part of the history of the missions but a lot of this was glossed over in favor of how wonderful the resulting accomplishments were and how great everyone got along with each other. The film ""The Right Stuff"" did a far superior job of showing the craziness, the absurdity, and some of the foolishness that comes along with these kinds of projects that involve millions of dollars and 1000's of people.

Probably the strongest and most informative episodes were the following: ""Spider"", the episode that chronicles the design of the LEM, aka the lunar module, ""Galileo Was Right"" which depicts one of the later missions in which the astronauts train to become like geologists, and ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" concerning the early 20th-century silent film of a voyage to the moon, which was made in France.

The most disappointing of the series has to be the first landing, ""Mare Tranquilitatis"". Apparently, there were many unexpected hurdles and unforeseen setbacks that almost prevented the first landing and the famous moon walk of Neil Armstrong from taking place. Many of these twists and turns were absent in favor of a patriotic outcome replete with glorious brass choirs. An issue about who would be the first man to walk on the moon and when Armstrong missed the intended landing target were the only stumbling blocks that were developed during the episode. I caught the tail end of a documentary about the subject in which Armstrong related many of the hurdles that had to be overcome to accomplish the mission which were glaringly absent from the television portrayal.

Patrotism is not born of flag-waving or music. It's born from admiring the struggles of our American heroes. Only when we see how much these people had to fight and struggle can we truly admire them. But if their struggles are softened, the true point of their heroism becomes lost, and I think that's what was missing from this series. If I had seen more of the ""tear your hair out"" hurdles that had to be overcome, I probably would have felt more patriotic towards these people and what they did. Instead I think I came away feeling like it was no big deal.",1433030400,,3720,4.9187898089171975

42421,5,0783114222,"This is one of my favorite mini-serieses, for two reasons:

First, I grew up during the space race and Apollo era, and remember, as a small child, watching the various liftoffs, Moon walks, and splashdowns. When Apollo 13 gripped the nation with its near-disaster, my parents were watching it round-the-clock, and the splashdown was announced by our grade school principal on the loudspeaker, which resulted in cheering. So I enjoyed the period color, clothing, and technology. It astonishes me that my daughter's iPhone has more computer power than all of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 went to the Moon. We use iPhones to send each other pictures of cats that look like Hitler.

The other thing I enjoyed about this mini-series was its ability to dramatize what was essentially an engineering procedural, bring its complexity to life, put it in the context of the times and the nation, create memorable characters, and focus on various aspects of the program in a comprehensible manner. Without giving away spoilers:

The first episode explains how the space barons figured out how they would get to the Moon, with some of the more dramatic portions of that effort.
The second episode focuses on the tragedy, investigation, and recovery of the Apollo 1 disaster.
The third episode uses a faux documentary technique to explore how Apollo missions got off the launch pad.
The fourth episode shows how Apollo 8 saved a most horrific year -- 1968.
The fifth episode discusses how the most unusual spacecraft was made and tested -- the Lunar Module.
The sixth episode focuses on the ceremony, glory, history, and struggle of Apollo 11.
The seventh episode is an Astronaut's-eye-view (first person) of an Apollo mission.
The eighth episode explores how the media covered the Apollo program, and how it shifted from addressing serious issues to superficiality.
The ninth episode is about two struggles -- an astronaut to get back into space and an Apollo mission to land on the Moon.
The 10th episode focuses on how to turn test pilots -- engineers -- into capable scientists when they are on the Moon.
The 11th episode focuses on the support for the astronauts -- their wives, whose lives were far from the idyllic ""super-wife"" portrayed in the media.
The 12th episode, also in documentary style, compares two subjects -- early visions of journeys to the Moon with the real ones.

Hopefully this does not give away too many plot points, but it shows that there were many different angles, sides, and visions of the Apollo program, and executive producer, director, writer, and cameo star Tom Hanks did a superb job with this HBO mini-series, and it gives credit where it is due -- not just to the astronauts, but the vast numbers of support staff on the ground, that put 12 human beings (and two golf balls) on the lunar surface ""for all mankind.""",1427673600,16,2833,4.883575883575884

Well acted, well written, just a beautiful documentary ... the first time I watched it, I watched the whole thing twice in a row.  However, my opinion of it declined a bit after watching BBC's Space Race, which isn't better per se but gives a richer, more complete story.

Space Race is obviously a lot less one-sided, giving as much attention to the Russian side of the race as to the American, but that's not the issue for me.  Even on the American side, Space Race gives more dimensions to the American side than From the Earth to the Moon does, discussing not just the popular All-American pilots and their wives, but also the German rocket scientists that designed the rockets and managed the program, and their controversial origins (they were former Nazi rocket scientists who surrendered to America after the war).  The story of the rocket scientists explained a whole lot about the rivalry with the Russians and even the origins of this drive to go to the moon.  I was surprised at how much all the Mercury, Apollo, and Gemini movies and documentaries I had watched had barely gone into this dimension, which added a lot of depth and richness.",1421366400,,1303,4.692982456140351

The Movie/Series is portrayed pretty good except when it gets to ""1968"" and after that it is basically Boring and dull. The Episode on the Wives was Unnecessary, and the introduction to each episode with JFK ranting about going to the ""Moon"" as well Repeated as a Special feature,the 1968 Episode I feel is disrespectful because it is more Politically Inclined and easy to do.(Read Leftist Slant.)And it comes with a Little Booklet and when It gets to ""We Interrupt This Program"" the little booklet says When Journalism was giving way to Sensationalism does it neglect to mention that journalism has always been Leftistslant and in such Case Sensationalist such as Duranty and his Stalin Apologetics for The NY Tass?My Favorite Episode is the one with Bean in it,And The Corvettes Racing/Drag Racing although some errors as the Apollo 12 Corvettes in The Series are NOT the 1969 Cars as it should be But Replicas which I understand but you can't fool someone by using something as Easily identifiable from the side as a 69' Corvette and the 1971/72 Corvettes which were used in the episode and passed off as 1969 Corvettes, The Astronauts Did indeed Have other Year Corvettes but not in the Riverside Gold/Black from 69, over the years they were several colors, and Riverside Gold was 1969 Color,There is lazy editing because the Same 3 Corvettes (Gold/Black) You see all have Rally Wheels and Later one is shown with the Deluxe wheel covers which The Actual 69' Has. Also in Episode 3 the CGI and the Background I noticed was Terrible. I Preferred Watching ""The Right Stuff"" Different Topic Yes but better and ""When We Left Earth"" than Watching anything Tom Hanks and Howard have to do with,I am glad I got the Set for less than $10 New I feel it could have cut out the episodes that were OFF Topic and focus on the Apollo Missions as the Filmmakers say it is about.",1400457600,4,2055,4.743016759776537

The series has been researched to a fanatical degree. The acting is a cross section of amazing talent. The writing and filmography, the tone and style of which varies by episode, is what one would expect of a Ron Howard production. Amazing.

42605,2,0783114222,"I very much enjoyed the series when it first aired, but I was very disappointed with this DVD set. This set presents the episodes in widescreen, but since they were filmed in a full-screen aspect ratio the top and bottom of the image is cut off. This leads to awkward framing of many scenes, and some scenes where crucial parts just aren't visible. I would highly recommend skipping this set and trying to find a copy of the older 1998 release.

Other than the aspect ratio issues, the show itself is still great, and presents a view of the portions of the space race that often get overlooked. I had read and enjoyed Andrew Chaikin's book ""A Man on the Moon"", and this miniseries lived up to the book that inspired it. In addition to the types of space capsule drama featured in the movie ""Apollo 13"" there are episodes that focus on the engineers and scientists, the astronaut's wives, the politicians, and even the Georges Mlis' 1902 movie ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"". The miniseries was produced by Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, and Tom Hanks, the same people that made the movie ""Apollo 13"", so they avoid showing that mission at all by instead focusing on the news reporters that covered it.

The cast were great, and include such diverse actors as Tom Hanks, Jay Mohr, Clint Howard, Chris Isaac, Bryan Cranston, Cary Elwes, Dave Foley, Adam Baldwin, Steven Root, Kevin Pollak, Sally Field, Al Franken, John Carroll Lynch, Debra Jo Rupp, and Alan Ruck.

And while the depiction of Apollo 13 is not entirely successful, depending as it does on fictional characters more than any other segment, it is still an admirable attempt to provide an alternate perspective on what had already been covered in the feature film.

42728,5,0783114222,"From December 1968 to December 1972, twenty-four men traveled the void of space on a voyage from the Earth to the Moon and half as many actually walked on its surface. In the HBO miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon,"" the history of Project Apollo is dramatized.

For the most part, the series is heavily based on reality and historical events. Viewers are taken back to the 1960s and early 1970s as we become familiar with the many people who not only flew the spacecraft but also worked as engineers and managers. The acting is great and the special effects, especially the scenes that take place on the lunar surface, are for the most part astounding.

One of the strongest points of the series is how stories most of us never heard of are brought to life. Everybody who was alive in 1969 could probably tell you where they were when Neil Armstrong stepped off the Lunar Module to become the first person to walk on the Moon. Many could probably tell you about the harrowing journey of Apollo 13 (no doubt helped by the hit 1995 movie of the same name). But what about the critical development of the Lunar Module and the flight of Apollo 9 (as shown in episode 5)? Or how Pete Conrad and Al Bean had more fun on the Moon than anyone else on Apollo 12 (as seen in episode 7)? Or even more down to Earth stories such as how the wives of the astronauts had to deal with the stress of new found fame and raising children (episode 11)?

The only weak point in the series is episode 8 which covers the drama of Apollo 13. While it is understandable that they did not want to re-make the movie Apollo 13, what we get is a rather silly story about a bunch of fictional characters (including a Cronkite-like news anchor) squabbling over journalistic ethics.

I have watched this series many times over the years and have always thoroughly enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this to those interested in spaceflight, the Apollo program, or the drama of one of mankind's greatest adventures.",1356912000,,1987,4.49584487534626

I am proud to have been one (out of 400,000 people) who worked on Apollo. My job was to make sure that the microwave transmitter (designed by RCA) used on the Lunar Excursion Module met the requirements of the landing radar.

On the Viking program, which successfully landed on Mars, I designed the transmitter myself. My own stuff is still sitting on Mars!

During recent debates between candidates for the GOP Presidential nomination, Mitt Romney laughed about Newt Gingrich's proposal to build a colony on the moon. I can understand the general public's loss of interest about space exploration and their concern about the cost this work. I expect someone running for President to have more perspective about the long term benefits of this effort.

42761,5,0783114222,"I was hoping to be surprised and wound up delighted.  Tom Hanks and his friends have done a masterful job of looking at the entire space program from John Kennedy's iconic speech committing the nation to landing a man on the moon within a decade to the end of the manned moon exploration program.  Apollo 1 and Apollo 13 are put into context as was the the public's flagging interest in the Apollo program.  The courage of those who dared to fly into the great unknown, the tenacity of those who figured out how to bring the dream of reaching the moon to fruition, the great toll on wives and families, and the emergence of science in the testosterone charged environment of manned space flight all receive dignified, if sometimes painfully raw treatment.  Could more have been covered?  Certainly.  Could more have been covered in the same format?  Doubtful.

Won't put much in his pocket but about the only way I can say thanks for all of his hard work as a straight up actor. During his commentary on the extra disk he mentioned he wanted everyone to come away with a total appreciation of the Apollo missions and to have people say to themselves, ""I never knew that happened"". Right on target Mr. Hanks and again, thank you for your endeavors.

Also worth watching is Ron Howard's ""In the shadow of the Moon"" created in 2007. Excellent presentation of how the Astronauts fealt about their work and adventures. While I have never had the pleasure of meeting any of these legends, you get a sense of what it meant to them to fly these missions. Wish I could thank all of them for their fantastic accomplishments. In my Navy retirement (Avionics) shadow box I put a small Apollo 11 medalion in the number one spot since it was this mission that generated my interest in space travel and Aerospace.

Until I watched this series again on the DVD set, I had almost forgotten what exciting times these were.  Several of the episodes stood out in my mind, but the one about Apollo 8 almost brought tears to my eyes.  Perhaps you might remember the troubles of 1968: the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, the Tet offensive in Viet Nam, the riots at the Chicago Democratic Convention.  It was going down as one of the worst years in the middle of the 20th century. As Apollo 8 returned to Earth in late December 1968, after humans had orbited the moon for the first time, the ""Capcom"" (capsule communicator) in Houston read some postcards or letters to the astronauts in Apollo 8 that had been sent in by ordinary citizens.  One of them had just three words: ""You saved 1968"".

Most people have widescreen TVs now, and I much prefer widescreen images.

This series (mini-series) was produced by Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Brian Grazer.  So this is the same bunch that put together 'Apollo 13'.  Anything with Ron Howard's and Tom Hank's name on it are always quaility product, and this is no exception.  This show is based on real people and real events, but it is not a documentary, so why people are complaining about this is beyond me.

I grew up during this era, and the NASA space program was always a shining example of technology and progress.  I remember the awe and wonder of these actual events, and the inspiration it gave me.

This DVD set tells the amazing story of Project Apollo. I know the history of Project Apollo well, and I consider this series to be quite accurate, and entertaining, I highly recommended it.

NASA was implementing plans to return to the moon until President Obama canceled the Constellation program and America's return to the moon.

Obama's NASA budget perfectly captures the difference in spirit between Kennedy's liberalism and Obama's.

Kennedy's was an expansive, bold, outward-looking summons. Obama's is a constricted, inward-looking call to retreat.

Skip to 2010. I bought the excellent book ""A Man on the Moon"" by Andrew Chaikin with a foreword by Tom Hanks. In it, Hanks claims to have used the book as the main source for the TV series. This book is very informative and covers a lot of details of the trips to the moon.

I watched the TV show once again to see how detailed it was about the whole Apollo program. I now realize that it leaves many, many things aside and it includes made-for-TV fictional drama. Consider the Apollo 14 mission, possibly the most challenging trip to the Moon, one that encountered never-ending problems from start to end. In the TV show, this mission is summarized basically  as a trip so that Alan Shepard can play golf on the Moon. This is simply bastardizing an epic mission.

Another episode is all about the wives of the astronauts and their hard, sometimes petty, troubles. This episode is almost nothing but fictional drama. Was it really necessary? The answer is no.

Along the way, we met a number of engineers, some astronauts, and Andrew Chaikin, the author of the book this series is loosely based upon.  It was a life-changing experience.  Those of us who remember Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo take for granted the amazing unity and outright fear and joy the whole nation and world experienced during the voyages to the moon.  These events were 40 years ago. Millions upon millions of our fellow citizens have no recollection of these adventures.  Many people don't even believe they happened.

Anyone with any technical background knows that it was an amazing feat with the technology of the day, and one wonders whether America is capable of such an achievement today, with today's technology.

After seeing Apollo 13 with my 7 year old son he was addicted. This HBO series filled and fed his addiction. When he was 8 he memorized and recited the well-known portion of Kennedy's Moon Speech (We choose to go to the moon in this decade ...) in the prose and poetry contest at his little British school here in London. Just that speech alone moved lots of the US citizens and UK citizens alike.

Extremely good.  I was a little disappointed by the Apollo 13 episode whereby it was taken from the perspective of a news reporter but in hindsight it was good to see the perspective of others.
Overall an excellent mini-series, historically accurate with some great real footage mixed in with stage and visual effects, blended masterfully.

42844,3,0783114222,"From the Earth to the Moon: 5 out of 10: From the Earth to the Moon is a strange bird. Not a mini series in the strictest sense. Each episode is self-contained with virtually no characters, except the space program itself, moving from one episode to the next. Each episode therefore is its own one-hour movie simply sharing the same sets with the other films.

Three are brilliantly done (episode 2 ""Apollo 1"" episode 5 ""Spider"" and episode 7 ""That's all there is"") The rest are either simply OK to outright misses (episodes 8 and 9) and by the time you are ready to spend an hour exclusively with the astronaut's wives (episode 11) the whole thing seems a bit of a slog.

Don't get me wrong the acting, sets and special effects are brilliant throughout but some magic is missing. When Apollo 11 lands on the moon there is no magic, no excitement. It is all very low key strangely focused on Buzz Aldrin's feelings about being second. I was also wondering what they were to do next since we land on the moon episode six in a twelve episode series.

The lack of a character or two that can be followed from episode to episode gives one little reason to invest in the slower episodes that follow number 7. There simply is no payoff in sticking with the program.

In the beginning of episode 8 about Apollo 13 Tom Hanks laments that Americans had become bored with the space program. The episode then spends 50 minutes digging up old chestnuts about old media versus new media. Turns out the American viewing public weren't the only ones bored with outer space.",1268870400,4,1558,4.51418439716312

This is a very well done series, and for the most part, historically accurate.  I must admit I found it a bit disconcerting in places where fact and fiction were intertwined -- for instance, on the Apollo 13 series, where they did the old veteran professional journalist being upstaged and ultimately replaced by the hotshot young tabloid-style reporter.  I wanted to know who the old guy was supposed to have been, and found out he was a fictional character.  I loved the first two episodes, but was less entranced by the third, which was the Apollo 7 episode.  Mark Harmon just didn't get Wally Schirra right.  The fourth and fifth episodes, depicting Apollos 8 and 9 (and 10 got a brief mention) were wonderful.  The episode on Apollo 11 focused on the complex character of Buzz Aldrin, and I think it could have been done better.  Apollo 12 was pure joy; and the one on Apollo 13 I liked even though it was the least focused on the mission itself.  I found myself not swept away by the Apollo 14 mission one, mostly because, again, it's hard to get Shepard right, and this one came close enough to be irritating when it didn't.  We loved the Apollo 15 episode, that focused on how hard it is to train pilots to be geologists.  I liked the Apollo 16 episode which focused on the wives of the second group of astronauts and their fates; my 13 year old son, as you can imagine, would have preferred hearing more about Duke, Young, and Mattingly on the moon.

The producers of the miniseries took great efforts to stay close to the facts and events as they happened.  Each episode is not only part of the big story, but also a standalone which shows us a perspective from an angle we weren't expecting or didn't know.

The success, in my opinion, of this show is to pass on the magnitude of the achievement to future generations who see the phrase ""we landed on the moon"" as a mundane fact of life which only the elders seem to get nostalgic about.  When my kids grow up, I'd like to watch this miniseries with them and see their reaction to a tremendous historical event which changed the world.
I believe this miniseries captured that spirit.

It is a 12 part series that covers many aspects of the Apollo program: from the tragedy of Apollo 1 to the evolution of journalism during Apollo 13. From the committees of Washington, DC to the craters of the moon, this mini-series takes the viewer on an amazing journey.

This movie was shot in the 'Apollo 13' fashion in the aspect that this is not a documentary...it is more of a movie.

The acting is extremely well done. The music (done by several composers) ties the movie together very well.

The rocket launches and the space scenes are a combination of real footage from the Apollo era and realistic computer-generated effects (especially in the first episode directed by Tom Hanks).

Amazon recently lowered the price of this mini-series to $14.99. I bought this series about four years ago and it cost me $59.00...and I would gladly pay that again. For $14.99 you get basically a 12 hour movie with a 30 minute documentary on the making of the film. Basically, you are getting an amazing deal.

It covers all aspects, from the astronauts, to their wives, to the engineers, to the administrators.  Special effects are wonderful, the individual astronauts are portrayed with great faithfulness, and each mission is approached uniquely and with fresh insight.  While some could look at Apollo 12 and 14-17 and think they're all pretty much the same, this series not only makes each crew and mission unique, it also brings attention to the previously unheralded missions that led up to Apollo 11, save the Apollo 8 mission.  My only criticism is the relatively sparse attention paid to Apollo 10.  But this one criticism aside, if you're a fan of or interested at all in the men, both astronauts and engineers, as well as their families, that made history and put men on the moon -- this is well worth the money.

Produced by Tom Hanks, ""From the Earth to the Moon"" does a superb job of depicting every aspect of America's space program.  Starting with President Kennedy's bold declaration 1n 1961 to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely, this set covers the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.

Having been born in 1965, I was too young to remember very much of this time in our history, but this collection expertly covers the early space race against the Russians to the heroic landing on the moon in July, 1969.  I can remember gathering around the television with my family to watch Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon.

What makes this set so special is that EVERY aspect of the space program is covered.  From the heroic efforts of the original 7 Mercury astronauts to the first manned spacewalks of the Gemini program and finally to the triumphs and tragedies of Apollo, including the tragedy of Apollo 1 to the triumphant rescue of the men of Apollo 13, this disc is loaded with the highs and lows of the space program.

I especially liked the format of the series.  It was designed more like a mini series than a traditional documentary.  Actors portrayed the key players in the space program, and boy, did they do a fine job!  I easily began identifying with each character in subsequent episodes.  Despite the mini series format, the history of the program was not neglected.  The outer space scenes are truly fantastic to view, and every historical aspect is correct, since NASA participated fully in the making of the series.  The viewer gets a true sense of what it was like to be an astronaut in the 1960s; from the highs of successfully completing a mission, to the lows of families who lost husbands and fathers.

I give this great series my absolute highest recommendation.  Its easy to see why this series garnered so much critical acclaim.  The story is razor-sharp, and the portrayals of personnel is first-rate.  This series is a must-view for people interested in America's early space program.",1255651200,,2139,4.737837837837838

At times the music bass was so off that it boomed and vibrated so loudly that I couldn't hear the actors, while other times it was normal.  Unfortunately, I don't want to return the set due to shipping costs.  But, will I ever be able to re-watch it again with the sound the way it is?  No.  Will I ever buy another DVD set from Amazon again?  I'm not sure.  This experience will certainly make me think twice though.",1251244800,2,634,4.460869565217391
42885,5,0783114222,"Truth is stranger then fiction as the saying goes. If there ever was need to prove this one would need to look no further then HBO's 1998 miniseries From The Earth To The Moon. Acting a bit as television companion to Ron Howard's feature film Apollo 13, this miniseries covers the years between 1961 and 1972, this epic twelve hour miniseries covers the race to the Moon from the perspective of those in NASA who went on the missions, supported them from the ground and watched them take place.

The epic cast of the miniseries is where much of its success lies. While it may be lacking any ""named stars"" in its cast it is a perfect place for numerous character actors to show their talents. The cast ranges from Nick Searcy as Deke Slayton, Lane Smith as the Walter Cronkite-like TV reporter Emmett Seaborn, David Andrews as Frank Borman, Stephen Root as Chris Kraft to Ted Levine as Alan Shepard, Rita Wilson as Susan Borman, Dave Foley as Al Bean and Mark Harmon as Wally Schirra amongst many, many others. Then there is of course executive producer Tom Hanks who acts, at the start of all but the last episode, as a sort of Chorus introducing the viewer to the story that is about to unfold.

The series is also blessed with fantastic effects work. From The Earth To The Moon builds on the fantastic effects work done for the feature film Apollo 13 to accurately and dramatically recreate the flights of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. Of special mention is the effects work done in the episodes ""1968"" and ""Mare Tranquilitatis"". The CGI and model work blends in near perfectly with the archival material used in places throughout the series. Yet perhaps the biggest special effects highlight of the production is the moon walk recreations. As other productions on the moon landings have shown, recreating these famous moon walks are not easy and yet by the time you have finished watching the twelve hours this miniseries covers you'll be amazed at just how convincing the moon walks are. While there are one or two questionable special effects (such as the LLRV crash in ""Mare Tranquilitatis"") the effects are fantastic pieces that help make the recreation of the missions all the more believable.

Yet the heart of From The Earth To The Moon lies in the scripts of its twelve episodes. Perhaps better then a documentary could, the miniseries' writing brings to the light of day the ambitions, dreams, egos, emotions, politics and the people behind the scenes of the Apollo mission to the Moon. While the first episode ""Can We Do This?"" moves along far too quickly due to the fact it covers as much history in a hour as the rest of the miniseries covers in eleven, the other eleven hours make for fascinating viewing. The various episodes cover the political fights that came up after the Apollo 1 fire (""Apollo One"") to the lead-up to the flight of the first manned Apollo flight (""We Have Cleared The Tower"") to the building of the Lunar Module (""Spider"") to the media coverage of the Apollo13 mission (""We Interrupt This Program"") to the scientific flights of the later part of the program (""Galileo Was Right"") to the effect of the mission on the astronauts wives (""The Original Wives Club"") to the contrasts between the 1902 filming of the George Melies film Le voyage dans la lune and, seven decades later, the last of the Apollo mission done in a documentary format (""Le voyage dans la lune""). Each script tells the story not only of the missions but of the people there as well and never does it descend into the clich one has come to expect from TV docudramas.

The best episode of the miniseries, in my opinion anyway, would be its fourth episode entitled simply ""1968"". Better then any documentary on the Apollo 8 flight I have seen to date, the Al Reinert (the filmmaker of the wonderful Apollo documentary For All Mankind) scripted episode puts the Apollo 8 flight in the perspective of the other disastrous events of 1968. Even more intriguing, the episode is stylishly shown with all of the Earth-bound scenes in this episode are filmed in black and white, while the astronaut scenes are in color giving an amazing documentary like effect for most of the episode. Add on the aforementioned acting and special effects, especially in the earth rise sequence, and the result is an amazing fifty-four minutes of television.

Across the twelve hours and twelve episodes it covers, From The Earth Of The Moon is an amazing piece of television. From its fine acting, incredibly done special effects and fantastic scripts cover the story of the voyages of Apollo. It tells not just the story of the technological achievement of the Apollo flights but of the human stories that lied behind them, mostly unseen. While it might not always be exactly true to life it may well be as close to an accurate recreation of those amazing missions as we are ever likely to get.",1250294400,,4874,4.715962441314554
42886,5,0783114222,"With 2009 marking the 40th anniversary of Man's first footsteps on the Moon, I can't think of a better way to celebrate than to enjoy the Tom Hanks/Imagine Entertainment HBO miniseries, ""From the Earth to the Moon"", now available at an amazingly low price. The 12-episode saga, touted as one of the most expensive TV productions ever made, at that time (at $65 million), certainly displays where the money went, with incredible recreations of the spacecraft, lunar surface, and activities far above our planet...but the real triumph of the miniseries are the stories of the men and women who made this adventure possible, from the astronauts and their wives, to the often-forgotten scientists, technicians, and support personnel, whose dreams, faith, and dedication made the impossible happen!

This miniseries makes a terrific companion piece to ""The Right Stuff"", as it opens with the 'Gemini' program that followed 'Mercury', and the selection of new astronauts to build upon the foundation of the original seven. The fact that America was certainly lagging behind the Soviet space program is not white-washed, and the Soviet triumphs actually provide an incentive to work harder and faster...which would create an astonishing series of technological advances, but would also result in the tragedy of Apollo One, and the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. Added to this were the changing sentiments of the times, as our country was rocked by assasinations and mob violence, the horror of Vietnam, and waning interest in space, and the fact that NASA still fulfilled President Kennedy's promise of a man on the moon by the end of the decade becomes even more remarkable.

There are great stories, each episode, often involving persons and events you may never have heard of, from the Grumman team who invented the lunar module from scratch, to the 'White Room' personnel whose humor and ministrations would be the last human contact the space crews would experience until they returned to earth. A whole episode is devoted to a geologist who teaches the crews not only the basics of his field, but the love and excitement to be found in a single 'special' rock. Of course, the Astronauts' stories are fascinating (from Alan Shepard's fight to overcome a 'permanent' inner ear condition, and return to space, to the endearing silliness of Apollo 12, with the hijinks of Conrad, Bean, and Gordon), with the importance of Frank Borman (David Andrews), highlighted, as his low-keyed sincerity 'saves' the space program after Apollo One, he reads Scripture while orbiting the Moon, and he deals with the descent into alcoholism of his wife (Hanks' real-life spouse, Rita Wilson, who is brilliant). The performance of Lane Smith, as a fictitious reporter patterned after Walter Cronkite (who also appears, in clips), should be singled out, as television news changed dramatically, during the Apollo years, as well, and his struggle to maintain integrity as the media turned to sensationalism rings very true.

An entire disk is devoted to Special Features, with a terrific 'Making of' documentary, and fascinating info about the Moon, Solar System, and our galaxy.

Truly, a 'Must Have', for any DVD collection!",1249603200,3,3224,5.1586998087954115
42887,5,0783114222,"Tom Hanks put together an excellent series on NASA's Apollo Space Program. It's rare when a documentary feels like a top Hollywood movie. Every part meets the quality standards of the others. It's also rare when Hollywood takes the time to tell a story right--letting the pace slow a little, so we can catch the social and emotional nuances of the story as well.

My family is watching these one at a time on Friday nights. We're asking our four kids questions about what we're watching, so it's a good family learning experience. We highly recommend this series. It takes in enough of American culture in the 1960s to make for a good history lesson.",1249603200,,650,4.6521739130434785
42888,5,0783114222,"""From the Earth to the Moon"" is a wonderful mini-series chronicling mankind's greatest achievement: putting men on the moon and bringing them safely home. If you've never thought about how truly amazing this feat was, you will after watching this. It not only makes heroes out of the courageous astronauts who put their lives at risk with every mission, but also the scientists and engineers who developed the technology to accomplish this unprecedented journey.

Below are my brief reviews of each episode (plus grades)

PART 1: CAN WE DO THIS? - In 1961, President Kennedy set the goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the decade. It becomes NASA's job to figure out how to do it (and beat the Russians). The first episode introduces many of the characters, both scientists and pilots, who will fulfill this mission. It also effectively portrays the magnitude of the task. Grade: A

PART 2: APOLLO ONE - A tragic accident during a training exercise claims the life of three astronauts on the eve of the first Apollo flight. Congress now questions whether the hazards and expense are justified. The dramatic hearings where NASA officials had to convince the government that the space program was worth the risk make for a riveting episode. Grade: A-

PART 3: WE HAVE CLEARED THE TOWER - Seen primarily through the eyes of a documentary film crew, this segment shows the tense build up to Apollo 7, the first manned mission after the tragedy of Apollo 1. Though it effectively shows the concerns of those involved, the episode drags a bit getting to the big launch. Grade: B

PART 4: 1968 - A turbulent year marked by war, assassinations and riots, 1968 also saw Apollo's first successful orbiting of the moon. One of the less engaging episodes because too much time is spent brooding over the year's terrible events and not enough time is spent in space. Grade: B-

PART 5: SPIDER - One of my favorite episodes of the series, ""Spider"" outlines the evolution of the lunar lander, the crucial piece of the puzzle needed to get astronauts to the moon's surface. A fascinating and fitting tribute to the great minds that worked on the project. Grade: A

PART 6: MARE TRANQUILITATIS - It all led to this: Apollo 11 - July 20, 1969. The first landing on the moon is as thrilling and stirring as you would expect. We did it, and we did it before the deadline! When Buzz Aldrin takes communion to commemorate the event, I was moved to tears. Grade: A

PART 7: THAT'S ALL THERE IS - Believe it or not, there were other missions to the moon after Apollo 11. Although public interest had waned, the flights continued. The personalities of the men of Apollo 12 are the highlight of this fun episode. Grade: A-

PART 8: WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM - A malfunction during the flight of Apollo 13 nearly led to tragedy. The episode takes the unique approach of viewing these events from the perspective of news people and technicians on the ground, but this story is told better in the film ""Apollo 13."" Grade: B

PART 9: FOR MILES AND MILES - Alan Shepard was the first American in space, but an inner ear condition then grounded him for years. Through his fight to regain flight status and get to the moon, I was rooting for him all the way.  Grade: A

PART 10: GALILEO WAS RIGHT - The later Apollo missions required men who were scientists as much as pilots. Though the episode is heavy on geology lessons, I found the astronauts' specialized training strangely captivating. Grade: A-

PART 11: THE ORIGINAL WIVES CLUB - This episode focuses on the astronauts' wives and the toll the space program took on their lives and marriages. There is little action in space, but the human dynamics are poignant. Grade: B

PART 12: LE VOYAGE DANS LA LUNE - The final Apollo voyage is interspersed with a recreation of George Melies' 1902 classic film. It's a fitting conclusion to the story of man's remarkable quest to visit the moon. After 35 years, why haven't we been back there? Grade: A

Before you view this series, let me suggest that you watch the excellent film ""The Right Stuff"" first. It lays out the events of our first ventures into space and introduces the original Mercury astronauts, several of whom appear in FTETTM. A good follow-up to the mini-series is the documentary ""For All Mankind,"" which features reflections from the astronauts and footage from the actual missions.

I have to say, after seeing the monumental efforts, both intellectual and physical, that it took to reach the moon, I felt proud to be not just an American, but proud to be a human.",1249257600,,4567,4.6546583850931675
42889,5,0783114222,"Great set, bought and viewed it and loved it. Loved it so much I bought 3 more copies to give as gifts on Father's Day and they all loved them also.",1247961600,,148,3.806451612903226
42890,5,0783114222,"I've always wondered why we don't have more TV series and movies about history. There are so many epic events in our history and film would be a great way to tell them. Fortunately, Tom Hanks et al rose to the challenge in retelling perhaps one of the greatest epics in our history - the race to the moon. I appreciate that the series took such care with historical accuracy rather than making another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Right-Stuff/dp/0790731541/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Right Stuff</a>-style movie.

For a TV series, this has great cinematography. It mixes historical documentary footage, black and white sequences, grainy ""1960s-style"" shots, and high quality computer generated scenes. They all flow seamlessly to give the viewer the sense of watching history, rather than just a TV show produced in the 1990s.

The only drawback is that the series starts with Kennedy's famous ""moon speech,"" rather than going back to Sputnik. I would love to have seen an episode dealing with Sputnik and the Eisenhower administration. Hopefully  some future filmmaker will take up this challenge.

On the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, I hope every single person takes the time to watch this series and learn not only about one of our greatest accomplishments, but also about the potential for mankind to explore and overcome challenges.",1247875200,,1410,5.513888888888889
42891,5,0783114222,"I want to make a point not just about 'From the Earth to the Moon' screen aspect ratio, but for many modern TV presentations that seem to be 'modified' when released on DVD.  It is a common practice these days for film makers to opt for both ratios.

Larry David did it with 'Seinfeld'.  Though shot originally in 4:3 ratio the show's scenes were actually composed to suit 16:9 ratio should it be required for future TV screen ratios.  So no cutting off of heads but instead to lose some unessessary image through cropping.

So many wonderful things have already been said about this film that I only need to add that no short cuts were taken and technical consultants were used to make this film as accurate as possible. Animations of events we could only imagine were realistically presented by state of the art special effects.

42925,4,0783114222,"From the Earth to the Moon was definitely an ambitious undertaking; i.e.  telling the entire story of the Apollo program from beginning to end, and bringing it and the people who were a part of it to life.  Overall, the producers succeeded superbly with an excellent miniseries.  I especially loved the fact that they incorporated into the story the participation of not just the astronauts, but others who played a valuable role in the program.

As a history graduate student, I did research on the early space program for my thesis.  I often find myself frustrated with the widely believed myth that it was President Kennedy that started the American effort to land a man on the moon just because he highlighted the goal and gave it greater importance with his speech before Congress.  In reality, it was a goal and program already suggested by Wernher Von Braun and Dr. James R. Killian, Science Advisor to President Eisenhower, and that it was Eisenhower who okayed the initial funding for it.  The series plays up the Kennedy speech a lot, but still highlights the lesser known fact that plans for the moonlanding pre-dated Kennedy's administration.

That being said, there were some episodes of this series that were rather disappointing and were just not handled very well for various reasons.  I'll take it episode by episode to illustrate my views on each:
1: Can We Do This?: This episode just tries to take on too much, with the entire Gemini program and some aspects of Mercury before it included.  The episode lacks any flow, and instead is just a jumble of clips of different missions and is ultimately hard to follow.
2: Apollo 1: One of the very best episodes of the series because it shows how this terrible tragedy almost derailed the entire program. This episode resurrected this somewhat forgotten incident of sacrifice to make the moon exploration possible.
3: We Have Cleared the Tower: Very good episode that explored what kind of men the astronauts were, and the role of those ground crew members who had to put every little thing together to make a launch happen.
4: 1968: As a historian, I loved this episode because it put the entire Apollo program into the context of time and place, i.e. the turbulent 1960's America.  For those who lived through the time, it was a reminder of everything that was going on while astronauts first voyaged to the moon; and for those who didn't, it is an education in the context of time and place.
5: Spider: Another excellent episode that showed the time, manpower, and creativity that went into the design of the all important lunar module that would actually land on the moon.  The egg heads in the workshop get their due.
6: Mare Tranquilitatis: Sadly, this all important episode which covers the Apollo 11 landing is one of the weakest of the series.  It totally failed to capture the moment of that first moon landing, when the entire world stopped and watched this unique event in human history.  Instead, the Apollo 11 crew seemed to be shown almost in a bubble of silence from the rest of the world.  Of course, they were in real life, but for the historical value of this moment as a worldwide event, there needed to be more of the impact aspect in it.  If I wanted to show my students the moon landing in all of its aspects, I would not show this episode.
7: That's All There Is:  This is the funnest episode of the series because the astronauts of Apollo 12 are shown as their committed, professional, but goofy and lighthearted selves.  They didn't have the weight of being first on them, so they could have fun with the experience.  I just thoroughly enjoyed this episode.
8: We Interrupt This Program: Unfortunately, the producers were faced with a great difficulty with this episode on Apollo 13--the story had just been told with the epic film released just a couple of years before this aired.  While the angle they chose to tell the story from for this (reporters' role) was interesting, I think it just lacked any gravity to it because you know the real story is the one they are talking about, but is not being shown (i.e. the lives of three astronauts hanging by a thread).
9: For Miles and Miles: I really liked this one because Alan Shepherd is  a forgotten American hero of the space race.  He was the first American to go into space, but was forgotten in the wake of John Glenn's orbit and later missions.  This episode tells the magnificent story of how he overcame his medical limitations that kept him from going up again for a decade and allowed him to set foot on the moon with Apollo 14.
10: Galileo Was Right: If I had to pick a best episode, this is it.  It clearly illustrates the scientific value of the Apollo program and the knowledge it gained us about our nearest neighbor in space.  As the astronauts learned to be geologists and field scientists, so too did the audience.  And it is never boring in doing so.
11: The Original Wives Club: Probably the weakest episode of the series, not because of the subject, but the way the wives' stories were executed as part of the series as a whole.  Instead of waiting until this episode that dealt only with their stories, the producers should have incorporated them into the overall story of the series more.  The result is that you are watching this episode the whole time wondering who each wife is, who is their husband, when is this again, because you have barely seen them, if at all, through the course of the series.  Too disconnected from the story to be an effective part of the story's telling.
12: Le Voyage Dans La Lune: I know Hollywood people think films are everything, but telling parallel stories of the first early film about a fictional moon landing with the story of the last Apollo moon landing just didn't work.  I was bored during the segments on the Melies film, and I think more could have been done on the decisions made by higher ups to end the program with Apollo 17 and the reasoning behind it, along with the final mission.

So, overall, good series, but some episodes were definitely a whole lot better than others.",1233705600,2,6091,4.627669452181987

42927,5,0783114222,"I enjoyed each and every episode of this 12-part mini-series. There are some small missteps. Sometimes (very few) the special effects do not deliver, but on the whole the production values are fantastic. Hanks's introduction at the very beginning is not always the best written monologues I've heard. The series shows some of the cost of the NASA space program in terms of money, time, relationships and life, but on a whole it is a great homage to the hundreds of thousands of men and women who worked on the program. My favorite episode is Apollo 15 with the geology emphasis. It shows why sending men to the moon was far better than sending robots. The last episode, Apollo 17, may be the weakest, but Cernan had a great perspective on the whole program. Apollo 16, which Sally Fields directed, showed the cost of the personal lives of the families of the astronauts. The casting was good. The special effects for the most part were good. The access the producers had to NASA archives must have been excellent. How the episodes tied together is good. The special features look interesting.

In summary, the series reproduces the awe and wonder I had of the lunar missions when I was growing up. That, by itself, is an amazing thing.

I can only reinforce all the other positive reviews as to the quality of production and the outstanding performances of all the actors and actresses.

You will not regret buying this mini-series.  It reminds us of a time when we did things not because they were fast and easy with instant gratification, but because they were hard and required focus and dedication to the task at hand.

The SCREEN FORMAT question: I bought the original '98 release as I felt it more important to not loose any subtitle information etc while watching on our 16x9 format TV, so I was expecting the sidebars on screen from the 1.33:1 image.  I don't know if our TV is automatically reformatting it to 16x9 but it fills the screen, and there is no lose of image that I can see/remember.  Subtitles are there, as is the stuck thruster that a recent reviewed mentioned was missing from the widescreen format.

42951,5,0783114222,"I would have given this ten stars out of ten if possible.  This was a monumnetal achievement by HBO when it was first broadcast and stands up just as well to repeated DVD viewings.

The race to the moon may well be mankinds greatest accomplishement to date.  We had only been practicing powered flight for about fifty years when the dream of taking the bold leap into outer space was made a national mandate by JFK.  In the span of a decade, thousands of the best and the brightest dreamed up how to do it, invented the machines to make it happen, and then invented the tools that they would need to make those machines.

This is not meant as a Discovery Channel Documentary, it is a historical docu-drama meant to entertain and inform...""From the Earth to the Moon"" hits it's mark thoroughly.

The magic for me is how each segment is presented from a different angle.  One focuses straightforward on the Apollo 1 disaster, another looks at the first flight through the eyes of a mock documentary.  Still another is seen through the efforts of the Grumman Corp in designing the lunar lander, while Sally Field directs an episode the tells the story through the eyes of the wives.

One of my favorite episodes is #5, ""The Spyder"".  It is about the creating of the Lunar Module.  It literally takes the viewer through the entire '60's in how they created the Lunar Module.  I love how it shows that they had to create everything from scratch, including the budget.

About ten years ago while we were working on the effects I was thinking of children like my nephew who were not born in time to witness for themselves the incredible events of the Apollo Missions. Could we capture the feeling? Convey the sense of wonder at seeing the earth hanging in space, alone, fragile, beautiful????

Could a child born in the ninties fully appreciate how Humanity moved up the evolutionary ladder in that riviting moment in the mid 20th century?

43000,5,0783114222,"MAN MUST EXPLORE! And, yes indeed, Galileo was right.

This tiny piece of docudrama, as someone else said in these pages, should not just belong on shelves of any American Family, but rather be part of anyone's Movie Collection in the world.

Although I agree with somebody else's opinion that this could have been more space-oriented and less politics-oriented, we have to remind ourselves that in those years we were in the midst of the Cold War, as well as been entangled in a tragic war in Vietnam.

This is why this story retelling of the conquest of the Moon, and yes, also of space, sends us a message that even in such bleak times, there was a light. A light that shone very bright in the darkness of our world, and brought us a sparkle of hope for the entire human race.

Despite its political and even military implications, as it was in the beginning, this project, to land a man, or men, on the Moon, developed into something totally different, Something noble, something useful and something creative.

In fact, my favorite episode of the 12 in this collection, is most poignantly ""Galileo Was Right"", dealing with the first of the three ""J""-step Missions of the Apollo, or as commonly known, the Apollo 15 Mission.

This, in my view, is the very best episode of them all, because it truly expresses and resumes why we went to the Moon in the first place.

Also, it is a great, and very short lesson, on how to learn to open our own eyes, look around us and truly ""explore"", not just the Moon, but rather Nature and Space as such.

It teaches us to ""read"" the great book that Nature has opened for us and never to shut our minds. In fact, best of all, there is even an original quote by Plutarch in it, with which I opened this review and closes the circle.

How many teachers are out there doing exactly this? Lighting a fire in their student's souls and minds?

It takes just a sparkle, a tiny bit of curiosity and a decent dose of passion to turn a simple student into an explorer, a scholar, a motivated and driven scientist.

What is more important, is that the subtext to this episode seems to be that there are simply not ""lousy students"", but rather ""very bad teachers"" out there. And if this applied to Astronauts, which were already very bright and open-minded, just imagine what this would entice, if you had your own child being taught by a ""blank-minded"" teacher.

The entire series deals with very human emotions and concerns. It is a journey through the minds of those who traveled and landed on the Moon, and it is also the exploration of those that stood next to these men, supporting them in every step to reach their goals.

In my view, this is a mini-series that should be screened in every school on this Planet, at least once a year.

This journey takes the viewer far beyond Space and the Moon, it takes him  through the thoughts, the worries, the grief and the emotions of true men, not heroes, not action figures, but true living and breathing people, who decided to sacrifice their lives in an adventure to benefit, and yes, for a brief moment even unite All Mankind in a noble endeavor.

At first, to be very honest, when I watched this series the first time, I started nagging with the fact that the actors did not resemble one bit to their historic counterparts (to me, a greater effort could have been made to cast actors who even just slightly, could ""pinpoint"" who they played).

But after repeated viewings, this nag slowly disappeared, being replaced with an admiration for its contents and the messages these episodes tried to convey, proving me totally out of place in criticizing such a work of art.

Yes indeed, I learned to bridle my prejudices and in fact started to use and open my mind to the experience that is ""From the Earth to the Moon"".
Because it is far more than your usual Mini-Series. It is a school of thought and beyond that, it is a class on human ethics.

If you, like me, were ""captured"" by the so-called ""conquest of space"" and beyond, the ""conquest of the Moon"", you will certainly don't want to miss out on this addition to your space collection in your video file.

I also want to thank all those involved in the production of this, in my humble view, tiny masterpiece of story-telling, with a particular reference to Tom Hanks, who also appeared in it and was executive producer of the series, who in my view has refreshed a tiny bit the stuffy air that one usually breaths from Hollywood.

Tom Hanks, joins the ranks of visionaries like Selznick, Zanuck, Mankiewicz, Welles and Spielberg in acting upon his ideas and passions and sharing them with us in such a vivid way.

Also a great many thanks to the excellent cast who makes it all so believable on screen. There is no moment in which someone overacted or tried his Hollywood bit. They all come through (including Tom Hanks himself, and also Sally Field) as very natural and truly ""feeling"" characters.
This should also be considered as a school for good acting.

The transfer on DVD is simply excellent, at least for my LCD HD-Ready Widescreen TV and my Sony DVD-Player. The sound is outstanding in 5.1 Surround Sound, never too invasive or too bombastic, just well calibrated.

I repeat myself, but I wished I had been there with those guys, in those years filled with new hopes and new adventures. I think I would have had a ball with them, even if in the end, I would never have actually participated on a Lunar Mission, just being there would have been an experience and a half.

This is intended for a screening with the entire family present. I think that mamas and papas would enjoy it as much as their kids, and even more so when they all group together to have some evenings of true quality entertainment...

Take this first leap for Mankind, it's just a small step away... and remember it is not ""what you pour in"", but rather ""what gets ignited"" that is important in life...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-the-Earth-to-the-Moon-The-Signature-Edition/dp/B000A0GYD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From the Earth to the Moon - The Signature Edition</a>",1193356800,,6130,4.6685236768802225
43001,5,0783114222,"First, let me say that I own both the 1998 full screen Collector's Edition and the 2005 widescreen Signature Edition.  Many reviewers are debating whether the 2005 edition is true widescreen (1.85:1) or a cropped version of the full-screen (1.33:1) picture.  Well, I compared the two versions I have, and I can tell you that the answer is:  IT IS BOTH.

In the filmed sequences, there is more of the picture visible in the 2005 edition.  This definitely means that the show was originally filmed in widescreen format.  However, the entire series is a composite of filmed sequences, actual archive footage/pictures, and computerized special effects.  Since the archival footage and special effects were not filmed in widescreen, they had to be cropped to widescreen format.  So, in the 2005 edition, anytime you see original archival footage or SPFX it is going to a cropped image.  The rest will be true widescreen.  In the 2005 edition, the cropping is very noticeable during opening title sequence of each episode.

Hopefully this review will help out potential buyers.  In my opinion the cropping is not a big enough reason not to by this DVD.  This is an excellent mini-series, and should be seen by everyone.",1193270400,8,1213,4.945544554455446

And it ends with Apollo 17 in 1972 and an imaginative recreation of George Melies' 1902 film, Le Voyage Dans La Lune (A Trip To The Moon). It also has a great selection of extras.

Each episode has a different cast, director and writer, so there is a different style to each one. Some may like this and some may not. However, the same actor does play the same astronaut throughout; so, if an astronaut went on more than one mission, that actor will play him again in the episode about that mission. Tom Hanks executive produced and opens each episode with a nice monologue. He also wrote Part 12 and co-wrote Parts 6, 7 and 11, directed Part 1, and starred in Part 12. Interestingly, Sally Field directed and starred in Part 11.

From The Earth To The Moon boasts a strong cast - many of them big television names - and some turning in wonderful performances. Most of the directors and writers are solid, but there are a few less-than-stellar showings. Overall, and considering that this is a TV mini-series, not a theatrical film, it's excellent. Space fans will still want to own The Right Stuff and Apollo 13, which form nice bookends for this series.

Here's a list of the 12 episodes, contained on five discs, with a few brief comments about each:

Part 1 - Can We Do This? - Good opener setting the stage for the Apollo program. Covers the period of 1961-65 and includes several voyages by the Mercury and Gemini programs.

Part 2 - Apollo One - Interesting investigation into why Apollo 1 caught fire, killing the three astronauts on board in a matter of seconds. David Andrews stars as Frank Borman, Mark Rolston as Gus Grissom, Chris Isaak as Ed White, Ben Marley as Roger Chaffee.

Part 3 - We Have Cleared the Tower - Interesting ""reporter's eye view"" of NASA and, specifically, Apollo 7, as a documentary crew follows the astronauts around, interviewing them and various other personnel. Mark Harmon stars as Wally Shirra, John Mese as Donn Eisele, Fredric Lehne as Walt Cunningham, Max Wright as Guenter Wendt.

Part 4 - 1968 - Alternating with scenes of social unrest caused by the civil rights movement and anti-war demonstrations, the assassinations of King and Kennedy, and riots at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, the crew of Apollo 8 prepare for the first manned voyage to orbit the moon. David Andrews stars as Frank Borman, Tim Daly as Jim Lovell, Robert John Burke as Bill Anders.

Part 5 - Spider - Terrific episode on the research and building of the Lunar Module, called ""Spider."" Conor O'Farrell stars as James McDivit, Brett Cullen as David Scott, Kieran Mulroney as Rusty Schweickart, Steve Hofvendahl as Tom Stafford, John Posey as John Young, Daniel Hugh Kelly as Gene Cernan.

Part 6 - Mare Tranquilitatis - Good episode about Apollo 11 and Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon. Tony Goldwyn stars as Neil Armstrong, Cary Elwes as Mike Collins, Bryan Cranston as Buzz Aldrin.

Part 7 - That's All There Is - Quirky episode about the Apollo 12 team who were best friends and each owned the same gold Corvette. Paul McCrane stars as Pete Conrad, Tom Verica as Dick Gordon, Dave Foley as Al Bean.

Part 8 - We Interrupt This Program - Disappointing story about one of the news anchors covering the Apollo 13 voyage. The crew hardly even appear! Lane Smith stars as Emmett Seaborn, Jay Mohr as Brett Hutchins, Tim Daly as Jim Lovell, Adam Baldwin as Fred Haise.

Part 9 - For Miles and Miles - Interesting story about Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard recovering from an inner ear disorder that had grounded him for ten years, the healing of which now enabled him to lead the crew of Apollo 14 at age 47 - and walk on the moon. Ted Levine stars as Alan Shepard, George Newbern as Stu Roosa, Gary Cole as Edgar Mitchell.

Part 10 - Galileo Was Right - Super episode about a professor of geology that NASA hires to turn the astronauts into geologists so they can understand what they're looking at when they investigate the lunar surface on the voyage of Apollo 15. David Clennon stars as geologist, Tim Daly as Jim Lovell, Tom Verica as Dick Gordon, Brett Cullen as David Scott, Michael Raynor as Alan Worden, Gareth Williams as James Irwin, John Posey as John Young, Zeljko Ivanek as Ken Mattingly, J. Downing as Charles Duke.

Part 11 - The Original Wives' Club - Interesting but tragic record of what happened to the astronaut's wives due to the stress of their husbands' jobs. Directed by and starring Sally Field.

Part 12 - Le Voyage Dans La Lune - Terrific ending to the series. Not only do we get the Apollo 17 voyage, but we also get to see a recreation of George Melies groundbreaking film of 1902. Tom Hanks wrote and stars as Melies' assistant, Daniel Hugh Kelly as Eugene Cernan, Tom Amandes as Jack Schmitt.

Bonus features include a wonderful behind the scenes featurette, a special effects featurette, John F. Kennedy's historic speech, and various still features, plus some trailers.

The fact that landing on the moon and returning safely was accomplished 6 times, and that no one actually died in space should be a source of amazement and pride for all mankind.

43035,5,0783114222,"I was born after the Apollo missions were a thing of the past, so I have no personal recollection of any of the events depicted in ""From the Earth to the Moon.""  And I have never been particularly fascinated with space, never one to say as a kid that I wanted to be an astronaut when I was older.  I thought ""Apollo 13"" was a solid film.  I say all of this to provide the context to suggest that I was not naturally predisposed to love this miniseries.

Nonetheless, I found ""From the Earth to the Moon"" to be utterly fascinating, a remarkable piece of filmmaking.  It helps that it covers a piece of history that is full of great stories.  I was in awe of the size of the task that lay before all those involved in the Apollo missions and the synergy of a million little decisions and inventions and steps and tasks that needed to come together to make Apollo 11 possible.  Thankfully, it didn't appear that the filmmakers felt inclined to exaggerate the stories.  Instead, they allowed the power of that slice of history to stand on its own.

Another strength of this miniseries was the technique of having different directors for each episode.  This allowed each episode to have its own feel, its own flavor.  This variety was refreshing and never allowed the nearly 12 hours of film to become stale.  Of course, there were a few episodes that I found to be less appealing, as one would expect from so many different approaches, but the diversity of storytelling techniques made a few personal dislikes to be worthwhile.

A final major strength was the fact that each episode focused on a different set of people in the whole scheme of things.  One episode focused on the media.  One episode focused on the wives of the astronauts.  One episode focused on the company contracted to build the lunar module for the Apollo missions.  One episode focused on the scientists within NASA who battled amongst each other on such things as the location of the next landing site.  One episode focused on the relationships between the three astronauts assigned to a particular mission.  Again, this varied focus provided each episode with a unique perspective and shed new light on the events.

My only complaint, and this is minor, is that the extras were very underwhelming.  One ""making of"" documentary was interesting, but the rest of the extras were rather forgettable.  I suppose that this was produced on the front end of the extras phenomenon, but I would have liked to have seen more interviews, unused footage, and maybe even some bloopers.

Overall, I would rank ""From the Earth to the Moon"" among the finest pieces of filmmaking that I've ever seen.  The acting was fantastic, and all of the production values were top-notch.  I was utterly captivated and wish that the series had continued into Skylab, the shuttles, and beyond!!",1179273600,16,2833,4.697768762677485

Some 40 years later, I am learning every shred about the Apollo space program.  Back then, my small mind only knew about them through abbreviated nightly news programs or during those annoying ""Special Report"" broadcasts detailing the flight path of the latest mission.

Every classroom in America should cover this body of work with our young minds, thirsty for examples of real leadership and what rewards can be had with hard work and the courage to take risks.

""From Earth to the Moon"" is worth every penny.  Run to buy it now.  And make sure you watch it with a big box of tissues at your side.  You'll be left with a tear in your eye and a lump in your throat throughout.",1177200000,3,838,4.402597402597403
43038,5,0783114222,"In the 1950's and 60's America got tired of hearing those words as it related to space flight. The Russians launched Sputnik before we had anything remotely resembling a satellite. Yuri Gagarin launched into an Orbital flight over a year before John Glenn achieved the feat. Names such as Titov, Leonov, Komarov, and Tereshkova (The first WOMAN in space) overshadowed names like Grissom, Shepard, Glenn and Lovell.

And then came Armstrong...

Well before his Historic Apollo 11 flight, Neil Armstrong made news (not to mention NASA history) when he and Dave Scott piloted the first docking in space with an Aegena booster.

After that, the race was over.... or was it?

Clearly the goal of being the first to the moon was accomplished. America won the first leg of the space race.

What this series really points out, however, (if you look deep inside the meanings of the stories) is that the race truly isn't over. It's human nature to want to go a little bit father. A little bit faster. A little bit deeper. We only need the challenge of competition.

Today, though we are working in conjunction with the former Soviet Union to colonize space, we still have the competitive spirit which compels us to be first at this, the only to do that or the ones to do this the longest (or most number of times.)

Space records were made to be broken. Gherman Titov still holds the record for the youngest man to enter a space craft. John Glenn (at 77) broke Storey Musgrave's historic record of being the OLDEST person in space.

The spirit of adventure is alive and well... and From The Earth To The Moon does a wonderful job of capturing the birth of this spirit and the development that continues well into the 21st century.

It's more than a documentary. It's not merely a chronicle. It's an appeal to the world... an appeal to embrace the majesty that is space exploration.",1176249600,3,1871,4.6626139817629175

43040,5,0783114222,"With the success of the movie `Apollo 13' Tom Hanks hooked up with HBO to do a historical docudrama with the same values that the BBC would put into a historical drama about the fall of Rome, such as `I, Claudius'. The appeal of doing something of this value on a 20th century topic such as the entire space race was just too good to refuse. In fact it was so good that HBO later hooked up with the BBC to produce the epic series `Rome'.

HBO defined the meaning of the `early 21st century television series are better than movies' phase, back in 1998 with `From Earth to the Moon'. It is amazing that they packed so much into just 12 x 1 hour episodes. It is also fitting that the title, From the Earth to the Moon, is also the title of a science fiction story by Jules Verne. The quality of the special effects is top notch stuff, just like the film. The range of actors is amazing and all of the stories reveal some interesting facts that you just took for granted or thought otherwise about. This is the kind of thing that makes you want to go out and actually read a science book afterwards.

All the episodes have an introduction by Tom Hanks.

#1 Can We Do This? -- The space race begins after America is caught napping and the Soviets send a man into space. Kennedy announces his attentions to send a man to the moon. Shepard makes the first American space flight.  Mercury and Gemini projects are born along with attempts at spacewalk, something the Soviets also did first.

#2 Apollo One -- Apollo 1 catches fire in a NASA training room and the crew are killed while under scientific observation. This congressional hearing faced some tough decisions.

#3 We Have Cleared the Tower -- Apollo 7 mission is covered from the perspective of a documentary film making crew.

#4 1968 -- Apollo 8 makes the first lunar flight.

#5 Spider -- The engineering of the Lunar Module for both Apollo 9 and Apollo 10.

#6 Mare Tranquilitatis -- Apollo 11 moon landing. America gets their first this time. The title of this episode is the landing site on the moon.

#7 That's All There Is --Apollo 12 has fun on the moon.

#8 We Interrupt This Program -- This is the Apollo 13 story (the film version is the one which Tom Hanks stared in). Since there is no reason to redo another Apollo 13, HBO tell it from the story of a TV anchorman who is facing a new form of tabloid reporting interfering with his scientific approach. Postmodernism after the moon landing has changed his life forever.

#9 For Miles and Miles --Shepard goes back into space for the second time to land on the moon and plays golf.

#10 Galileo Was Right --Apollo 15 astronauts turn scientific geologists and expert reporters. Galileo's law of falling bodies is proved again, this time on the moon's surface.

#11 The Original Wives Club -- This tells the story of the heartache and troubles that the wives of these men had to deal with. The episode is more interesting than what it sounds at first. The statistics on astronaut divorce rates are a whopper.

#12 Le Voyage dans la Lune -- The last Apollo 17 mission to the moon and revision of previous moon landings.

Overall this is a real brain stimulator that could be summed up by saying that people like Shepard and Gagarin were absolutely crazy to have done what they did. See images of Shepard with tape around his boots in what looks more like diving gear than a space suite. Feel free to experience the full impact of what is the pinnacle of test pilot extremism, to the moon landings to putting scientists in space.

This was not only a walk down memory lane for me, but a tremendously educational experience.

When compared to the identical scenes of the same clips on the other discs, you can see the missing parts, on the sides, that are missing on the full screen version.

It is not a story that can be told in an hour, or two, or five, and it is hard for my children to understand how the Apollo program changed the world technologically, socialogically, and psychologically, but From Earth to the Moon brings the story to life.

43059,5,0783114222,"First of all, it is important to understand that we never went to the moon. The Apollo project was a hoax.

I won't try to prove anything to you in this review, but I will recommend the documentary film, Astronauts Gone Wild. In the film, the film-maker confronts eight of the living astronauts who claim to have traveled to the moon. It is clear from their reactions (especially Buzz Aldrin's) that they did not go to the moon.

Buzz Aldrin comes very close (in my opinion) to actually admitting that it was a hoax. Judge for yourself.

I am giving this mini-series (From the Earth to the Moon) a five star rating because it confirms without question in my mind that we never went to the moon. So it is a must see for anyone who is looking into the Apollo Hoax. Don't get me wrong. This is a very boring mini-series.  I literally fell asleep several times trying to get through disc 1.

But this mini-series is important because it brings up important questions. Here are a few questions that come to mind:

Who in Hollywood knows that the Apollo project was a hoax?

Is Tom Hanks a criminal for making this film, or is he just another person who has been fooled into believing that we really went to the moon?

Is producer Ron Howard a criminal?

Who should be investigated? Who should be arrested?

In light of the fact that the Apollo project was a hoax, it is reasonable to guess that the crew of Apollo 1 (Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee) were murdered. They were probably murdered because they knew first-hand how absurd the idea of making it to the moon within the decade was. They were, most likely, being silenced. This is a reasonable theory.

Episode 2 in this mini-series deals with Apollo 1. After watching this episode, I am convinced that those Apollo 1 astronauts were murdered, and this film is intentionally trying to cover up the murders. So the big question (if this theory is correct) is: Who (in the production of this film) needs to be investigated and arrested for trying to cover up the murders of three astronauts?",1163030400,2,2050,4.528455284552845

There is indeed vertical loss of picture in this ""widescreen"" version. It's been cropped. The picture quality still remains quite good however. The fact I have both versions should tell you how highly I regard this show. Even though the episode on Apollo 13 is quite lame, this series remains a remarkable achievement, the very best thing to come out of Hollywood in many long years. But if there is indeed a true 16:9 version, this isn't it. More marketing hype.",1162684800,11,578,4.732673267326732
43061,1,0783114222,"In previous reviews the aspect ratio of this DVD set is often mentioned. I have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong. It may be true that the series was shot in 16:9 and I remember seeing it that way on Belgium TV, but this is not that version! When watching these DVDs it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong: the top of people's heads are frequently cut off, sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible. I also own the Dutch DVD-set of this great series which has 4:3 aspect ratio, no extras but very cheap, less than $10,00. Comparison showed that the Signature Editon used the 4:3 version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a 16:9 version. Again, if the series was originally shot in 16:9 than this is not that version! Shame on you HBO for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called Special Edition!",1161734400,48,935,4.379310344827586
43062,5,0783114222,"I watched and loved the series when it originally came out on VHS. A chance to meet Neil Armstrong and John Glenn this year prompted me to take another look. I consider this work the best mini-series of all time, which is perhaps biased, as I have read extensively about the space program and have been a big fan since attending a ticker-tape parade for John Glenn as a young boy.

Both fans of the Apollo program and general movie watchers who enjoy human drama and have even a speck of interest in the historical aspects of Apollo should be well satisfied. Tom Hanks pulled together an exceptional work, as his team hit the highlights and the details at key moments, with enough other offbeat and background moments to add to the entertainment (one that comes to mind is Pete Conrad's instructions to his team to do their business before they headed in for the lunar landing). The score fits well, and the occasional pop number reminds the viewer how (unfortunately) long ago these events were.

Given that Apollo 11 is only around the midpoint of the series, Hanks was up to the challenge of maintaining momentum after the early climax. Focus shifted from the flights themselves to alternative themes. Apollo 12 highlighted the free-spirited Pete Conrad and the luckiest moonwalker of them all, Al Bean. Apollo 13 obviously could not re-do the movie that was relatively new at the time, and remains popular. The summary was reasonable, with the emphasis on the career conflict among the newsmen just OK, and probably the weakest of all the segments. Apollo 14 had the return of Al Shepard, and 15's episode was a solid detour into the rise of scientific objectives and the change in astronauts' thinking. Once again the astronauts showed their exceptional talents, and another part of the gigantic support structure showed its value, besides the usual Mission Control crowd.

The Spider/Apollo 9 episode and the Apollo 8 episode may be my favorites.  Apollo 11 was of course well done, but I am so familiar with the landing and its issues, that it was unable to surprise me much. However, the connection of Apollo 8 to 1968 and Apollo 9 to the creation of the LEM were both clever and solid storytelling that wonderfully mixed the technical and personal.

Kudos also go to the story about the wives in the 11th episode. The families largely disappeared after the early segments, with the exception of Apollo 13, and Hanks was smart to round out the series with another round of human interest.

A fitting tribute to the famous JFK speech with a personal introduction from Mr. Hanks at the beginning of each episode, this DVD series will bring an almost spontaneous swell of American pride to anyone who watches it.

The historical story lines, writing, actors' real people history maker protrayals, set decorations, stirring theme music and production qualities, are all truly terrific.  A lot of previously heretofore unrevealed, behind the scenes, manned space program trials and tribulations go beyond merely the highlights into much deeper detail.

This is movie making at its very best for both contemporary American history buffs as well as space afficionados with a penchant for all the  technical aspects of Apollo.  Well worth the DVD boxed set price for this superlative, albeit ""TV"" miniseries, the newly re-released, ""Signature Edition"", in High Definition (widescreen format) with DTS sound audio transfer, promises to be even better than the original.

I could get the transcript from a variety of sources and not have to pay for it. The same is true for the list of famous astronomers.

Many have wrote that this mini-series is perhaps the best ever made for TV next to the Band of Brothers. For once, the hype is true. This mini-series traced in twelve parts, the history of the Apollo space progam. The men and women who made it worked, made it happened along with disasters and mishaps. Outside of one episode, all others relating to the Apollo programs appears to have a great deal of historical accuracy.

I have read the previous review about the widescreen conversion. I think there's a merit to that but I wasn't thrown off by it that much to make a difference to me. For me, it was the story that totally engrossed me. Another thing I like about this mini-series was that it didn't try to compared with movies like the Right Stuff or Apollo 13 but instead work around these two movies. Thus, if you watch Right Stuff, Apollo 13 and this mini-series, you will have a definite visual understanding as drama can have it, of United States entire space program until the end of the Apollo missions.

43082,5,0783114222,"This series of DVDs is my favorite. It is informative, inspirational, moving, and infinitely re-watchable. The best all around DVD investment I have made.

The series captures much of the same feel as The Right Stuff and Apollo 13, especially in terms of the human dynamic between the astronauts, mission control, and others. But the scope is much boarder (all Apollo missions), and the series can explore more nuances. For instance, Alan Sheppard dealing with his inner ear infection, the dynamic in the Apollo 11 crew in terms of who would step on the surface first, and the emotional roller coaster experienced by the wives.

My favorite episode is Spider, about the development of the Lunar Module (LEM) by the engineers at Grumman. You don't have to be an engineer to be moved by this story. I re-watched it last night and my wife cried at the end.

Some of the episodes are ""straight forward,"" depictions of the challenges of the astronauts. Of course, there was nothing straight forward about these missions. In fact, one of my take-aways was a better awareness of how daunting some of the missions were, and how often something small would go wrong that could have become huge in no time if not resolved.

Many of the episodes capture a concept surrounding the cultural challenges of going to the moon and the state of society in general. Clearly due to the fact that Apollo 13 the movie preceded this series, in that episode they focus on the advent of sensational and intrusive journalism. First Wives Clubs look at the challenges of being the wife of an Astronaut, from the loss of life to the changing morals of the period. Other episodes juxtapose the astronauts challenges with the state of America in 1969.

There are laughs too, and some of the episodes play up the humor.

But ultimately you are left with a human connection to what was a human rather than solely scientific ambition - the story of the many known and unknown people who dreamed great dreams and achieved them despite overwhelming obstacles.",1134691200,4,2024,4.785100286532951

43087,4,0783114222,"From the Earth to the Moon: Signature Edition (2005)

I don't intend to review the content of this DVD set as it has been covered in great detail by many hundreds already. If you love top-class historical drama and enjoyed Apollo 13, you probably know about the quality of this miniseries already. My rating for the miniseries itself is 9.5 out of 10.

This is a short review to point out the differences between the 2000 4-Disc box set and the 2005 Signature Edition 5-disc box set.

In case you have already got the 2000 DVD set in your collection and are wondering whether to update it to the 2005 edition, here are the differences:

Firstly, there are 5 discs instead of 4, but NO difference in content. No extra scenes, documentaries or commentary. The original DVD-Rom Disc 4 has been re-authored to play on your DVD player in the lounge room. This makes a lot of the content immediately accessible instead of having to search for it on the net, but the interactivity is gone. For me that's small loss as I didn't get much out of the games etc anyway.

Secondly, the entire set has been remastered in DTS and Widescreen (1.85:1). Now this sounds like manna from heaven, but unfortunately only the audio remastering is really worth spending any extra dollars on. The sound is crisp, clear and beautifully mixed and the liftoffs etc come booming out of your home theatre system like you were there at the Cape.

But the widescreen - well, sadly it just doesn't enhance the original viewing experience. It's evident that HBO produced the original series in 1.33:1 for tv and have merely re-jigged and adapted that ratio for the modern proliferation of widescreen plasma television sets. There is no extra data. You will find some scenes are better cut in the frame, but others suffer. For example, in Disc 1, when the Gemini 8/Agena assembly is tumbling around the sky with a stuck thruster, you don't see the thruster in the new widescreen version as it is cut off by the top of the frame. Some captions have also been compromised.

As the series was created for the 1.33:1 ratio, all the crucial information is positioned inside the frame for that ratio anyway. The only advantage of the widescreen ratio is that it now fits your new plasma widescreen without the black bars. Also the video quality is not as crisp as I expected it to be, possibly from the re-sizing process.

Each chapter now gets its own play and audio options menu and there are 3 chapters per disc, which is tidier. However there are still those weird groupings of episodes where some contain the titles and some don't. Nothing has changed here.

The box looks impressive with the silver signature cover and Tom's moniker on it and there is a nice holo of the Earth and the Moon which alternates as you tilt it this way and that.

But, in a major disappointment to this buyer, the original cardboard foldout format is identical to its 2000 counterpart. My box broke apart after about a year due to excessive wear and tear and sadly I fear this box will succumb to the same fate. Two of my discs had already broken free from their moorings in transit and were sliding all round the inside of the box, picking up scratches and marks in the process. Poor packaging.

How I wish they'd used the Battlestar Galactica Season 1 format where all discs sit securely in plastic pages like the leaves of a book. Sturdier, simpler and more durable.

In summary, if you don't have From the Earth to the Moon, then buy this 2005 set. If you have it already and are wondering whether to spend $100 on a better version, think twice. You may think it's worth it to get better sound, but unless you are an audiophile with a top home theater surround system and DTS, you probably won't notice. You may be better off spending your money on other titles.",1128470400,350,3809,4.568914956011731
43088,3,0783114222,"A voyage that took years of planning, insurmountable odds, and the imagination of a nation.  Technology that had never been invented, uncharted machines to test, not to mention the perils of sending astronauts into the cold depths of space.  Many thought that going to the moon was insane and suicidal.  Some thought that it wasn't possible, others thought it a waste, but the majority saw it as a chance for the human race to shine (not to mention the politics involved).  This is what the series tries to captures; The missions hardship, the endurances, the courage, and the audacity to dream big.

The series in its entirety is quite amazing, even to this day!  The special effects, though dated, can still (at times) cause you to stare and be amazed at the quality of some of them.  The audio quality is quite good, not to mention a superb sound track, that plucks at the heart strings.  Tom Hanks (and his crew) knew how to pull it together, to enthrall the watcher... to capture them in the moment.  At some points, I will admit, the viewing does slow down a bit... and it appears as if what's happening is losing focus, but that is very far and few between

I do not have the orginal series to compare the widescreen version to, to see if they actually did chop the top and bottom, so I cannot comment on this.  I can, however; state that although I would be displeased if they did chop the film to make it fit widscreen tv's, it doesn't take away from the film.  There isn't a moment that goes by that I go ""Look they cut out a really important image at the top!"".  Sure it would be nice if they left it alone (if there was no original widescreen shooting of the movie) but like I said, it doesn't deter one from watching it.

So If I praise this series, then why did I give it 3 stars?  Quite simple, the packaging.

The packaging for this boxed set could have been much much better.  Even the quality of the dvd's could have been much better.  I just recently returned one box set because Disc #2 was scratched (looked like it happened during the creation of the dvd).  So I returned it, and got another one... took it home... opened it up, and that one is scratched as well!  Not only is it scratched, but it's the same dvd that's scratched and it looks like it's the same exact pattern of scratching (scratches run the width not radial scratches).  This lead me to believe that it's a manufacturing defect, and it may be on many copies of this box set... if not all of them (which is hopefully unlikely).  Why is it only occuring on disc 2?  I have no clue, it could be that each dvd is created on a seperate machine... or mabye I have bad luck...

But that's not all, the case is quite fragile.  It's not fragile as in dropping it will destroy it (although you risk spilling your dvds out, or putting quite a dent in the case).  It is very suseptible to scratches and dings.  If you tap the case, you can dent it, the shrink wrap that was protecting it left an imprint in the box (were the edges of the wrap were joined).

The inside is nice, but equally flimsy, not very sturdy.... not to mention it to is very suseptible to drops, dings, and scratches.  Don't get me wrong, I love the layout and the attempt to have an original case... but in doing so made a case that just isn't worth the amount you spend.

For nearly $70 you should get a much sturdier and more protective case and dvd sleeves.  Many boxed sets have more dvds, cost less, and are enclosed in a much better, sturdier, and well designed case.  This is a case of form over function, when it should be function over form.  The box is indeed very pretty and the inner sleeve case has a nice layout... but you feel like it needs to be handled with gloves, or you may destroy it.

In the end, I love the series, it's a very powerful set of shows to watch, however; it has it's downfalls.  After buying the box set, I'm left feeling that... although this is a great series, I've been let down.

I feel as if HBO slapped this together in what they thought would be a nice shiney attractive box (which it is!!!  But is poorly built for the price), and put it in widescreen (knowing that the majority of the public now likes widescreen over full, and this is assuming that they chopped it... which may or may not be the case)... then they slapped a high price tag on it because it carried Tom Hanks name and was a great series.

Pros:

Awesome Series

Great Acting

Great SoundTrack/Effects

Nice Menu System

Cons:

Poor Case Design (need to handle it with gloves)

DVD's can be faulty (as two #2 discs had identical scratches on them)

Pricey

Sometimes the quality of the video seems to change from scene to scene (and I'm not talking about video that is 40+ years old I'm talking about the video that contains the acting).

In the end, would I recommend this?  IF you have $70 that you don't know what to do with!  If you don't... well wait awhile I'm sure the prices will eventually drop.",1128384000,11,4966,4.33297180043384
43089,3,0783114222,"When you compare this series with the ""actual"" moon landing footage from Nasa, this one is by far a better job and more realistic looking.  It just goes to show you that a moon landing hoax is not impossible to do, just take a look at how well done this series was, since they didn't actually go to the moon to film it, yet they pulled it off as if it were real and there was zero gravity.  Bravo!

If a movie company can do it so well with their budget and resources, keep in mind the government has an endless budget and resources to make such a movie too.

Also keep in mind that the US government is said to have sent all these men and missions to the moon, never once crashing on the moon or being unable to get back, and that is with 1960's technology, but today with all our computers and modern science, we can't seem to get MOST of our probes to Mars without crashing or getting lost, and the ones that do make it, constantly have problems and of course, we don't have the technology to ever have any of them come back to earth either.

To this day, the Russians, who beat us into space, beat us with satellites, even created a space shuttle that looked almost exactly like ours does, have STILL not been able to send a man on the moon.

President Bush wants to send a man to the moon, and for some reason it will take about 15 years to do it.  Perhaps by then, we will actually have the technology and ability to do such a thing.  Why doesn't anyone ask Nasa why they don't just use the EXISTING plans of space craft they already had so much SUCCESS with using 1960's technology that never lost a man on the moon?

Because that wasn't real?  Because it really will take 15 years before Nasa can figure out a way to get a man on the moon for real?

This series is very enjoyable when you realize it is science fiction all the way.  But do not confuse this with the real history of the US space program.

If out of dozens of probes sent to Mars, only a small tiny fraction ever make it, and of those, so many problems occur, then how can going back to 1960's technology have several manned moon missions where not one single man or craft crashed on the moon and died.  Not one.  PLUS they were able to go from the moon back to earth again, something no Mars probe has ever been able to do with today's technology.

Surely, if even today, we have a plan and desire to ""return"" to the moon, the Russians would still want to at least go to the moon ONCE.  Yet they still don't have the technology to do so, just as we never did yet.  Nasa thinks in 15 more years we might be able to first send a man to the moon.

When watching this excellent series, keep in mind that they are not REALLY on the moon in this film.  The extras reveal HOW they dealt with the special effects of less gravity and such.

Keep all of that in mind when watching the Nasa films too.

I like this series so much that even though I bought and own the first DVD set, I just had to buy the signature series. The reason I bought the signature series was because it says it is in 16:9 aspect ratio unlike the first set which is conventional 4:3. I thought to myself ""they must have filmed it in 16:9"".

When I played the first disc it looked strange. So when I compared the two sets, I saw that the way they got the 16:9 was by zooming into the 4:3 video which essentially lops off some of the top and bottom of the picture. This has disappointed me. When you buy or rent a movie that has been converted from 16:9 there is a message that says, ""This film has been modified from the original to fit your television"". Well it would have been nice if this set said, ""This film has been modified to fit your 16:9 television"".

I am a victim of clever marketing. I am disappointed that Tom Hanks would let something like this happen with one of his products. He has a fantastic reputation. I am disappointed.",1127606400,213,1129,4.174311926605505

43104,5,0783114222,"I, as I am sure anyone else who watches this mini-series, knows the JFK speech at the beginning of every episode by heart that is blended in with the magnificent score. Those combined give you visions of hopes, dreams and promises of the young space program's race to the moon against the Soviets. You are cheating yourself if you don't watch Tom Hanks' wonderful compilation. There are just days on the weekends where I watch certain episodes of this over and over and over again! Even the episode about the geologist who trains the astronauts was wonderful. (Considering how boring geology is to me, that's saying something.)

Although I didn't think I'd have the stomach to watch the Apollo One episode about the launch pad accident with Astronauts Grissom, White and Chaffee since the died so horribly but I'm glad I did.  The struggle and the heartache that everyone involved with the testing went thru  was priceless and informative. (Boy, Walter Mondale pissed me off in that one!) The whole program came so close to collapsing that it's scary.

My favorite episode is between ""1968"" which was extraordinary, ""Spider"" and the one about the Wives.  I specifically enjoyed ""1968"" because I vividly remember that year.  (My mother knew Dr. Martin Luther King) and we were living at Camp Lejeune where some of my friend's fathers were due to go to Vietnam.  Not to mention when Kennedy was shot and there were riots and protests about everything (Race and the war, etc.) Somehow I don't remember the pass around the moon  (I think I was still on my Christmas high) but this episode was edited so wonderfully with it's intense and fast moving images that it portrayed the year much like it happened, one catastrophe after another from January thru to December.  They really did ""Save 1968"".  The acting by Tim Daly, David Andrews and  Robert John Burke when they first saw the earth rise when orbiting the moon was thrilling.  You could feel the excitement  and the score was magnificent.  (How weird that all three of them were featured in Stephen King movies. ""Storm of the Century, Graveyard Shift and Thinner respectively)

The score for ""Spider"" alone makes me yearn for a decent soundtrack to this mini-series, it was just magical.  (If you're thinking about buying the CD.....DON'T, believe me you'll regret it)  The acting was sedate and understated, but also comedic which were all appropriate for this episode.  The tension and frustration of building something that had never been built before IN TIME for the scheduled Apollo mission (which wasn't accomplished by the way)  was conveyed effortlessly it seemed .  All of the different episodes were entwined like threads of a rope and yet were fitted like the symbolic separate pieces of sculpture of the God Apollo behind Tom Hanks at the top of each episode. As he narrates each episode and walks forward the sculpture comes together to form one complete sculpture. (You have to see this part to understand the symbolism)  The flaws that held up the mission in ""Spider"" rearranged the missions so that the crew of Apollo 8 in ""1968""episode were able to end that year on a much needed high note.  The little details like those that tell this tale make this a masterpiece!  This is why you should watch every episode as the characters float in and outside of their own episodes adding nuances and insights to each different story just like in real life.  But each episode stands alone on it's own merits too which makes this Brilliant!!  BRAVO TOM HANKS, you preserved our Apollo missions beautifully!!",1126051200,7,3565,4.852892561983471
43105,5,0783114222,"For those of you that didn't get it the first time, or like my family, wore you set out in the space of a year, get this miniseries while you can, because it is well worth the price, just to see history done in a dramatic way that is done with different tones for each part.",1121904000,8,274,3.9107142857142856
43106,5,0783114222,"I watched this series some years ago, when a friend of mine (CPC) lent it to me. Since then, I wanted to buy it for seeing it again. Finally, I got it from Amazon last year.

It is one of the best series I have watched in my life. Let me tell you why.

First, it keeps almost all the details from the real story: phrases, words, pictures, sounds, landscapes. It was done with a lot of care.

Second, it has some pieces from documentaries so it reminds you about what was happening those years in politics, economy, space policy... and social policies too.

Third, it covers many aspects of the space exploration, from the begining to the last Apollo mission with a great performance of the stars and the producers.

Fourth, it teaches you a lot of a very important part of mankind's history in an enjoyable way.

Finally, I would like to tell you that you musn't miss the last chapter: this one summarizes the spirit of human's exploration, our power of imagination, the many technological challenges that a space mission has and many many other things.

It's worth getting it.",1120694400,7,1077,4.549222797927461
43107,5,0783114222,"In a docudrama like this, even a nitpicker like me looks more for their getting the tone right, rather than the bare facts. Does it emphasize what mattered, and in the right way? Does it cover the essentials? And this production absolutely does.

You get a feel for just how risky Apollo 8 was, and what it meant to Americans alive at that time to be sitting in front of their televisions on Christmas Eve watching a hazy triangle of lunar surface go by while listening to men a quarter-million miles away read sublime poetry. I was ten years old then, and I still remember it vividly.

You get a feel for what it took to build a machine to land men safely on the Moon, and what it took out of those who built it.

You understand the scientific goals of the missions, and how the astronauts were persuaded to pursue them - and how enthusiastic some of them got, once they fully understood how important their efforts were to geologists back home.

It's just a superb evocation in every way, especially the chapters I single out: ""1968"" (about Apollo 8), ""Spider"" (Apollo 9, the first to fly the lunar module), and ""Galileo Was Right"" (Apollo 15, the first mission focused on science). If there's a weakness, it's the Apollo 13 chapter, which in order not to duplicate the (wonderful) movie focuses on the news coverage of the mission rather than the mission itself. I would have liked them to focus on what the mission controllers and ground support personnel did, a topic that the movie left plenty of room for.

But the rest is absolutely brilliant. I seldom find time to watch my DVDs and videotapes, particularly ones I've seen already, but I've watched episodes of this over and over again. Highly recommended.",1120089600,8,1715,4.609836065573771
43108,4,0783114222,"Overall I enjoyed the set, one one small point that rubbed me the wrong way,there was next to nothing about the Mercury Program!! they spent maybe 20 min on it and them went to straight to the Gemini Program,nothing really about John Glenn orbiting the earth or Gus Grissom and the blown hatch they were mentioned as a afterthought ,never mind that without the Mercury 7 Program there would not be a Gemini or Apollo Programs. Just my 2 cents worth",1118275200,3,448,4.54320987654321
43109,3,0783114222,"This whole TV-series-on-DVD phenomenon's getting a bit nuts. Maybe I'm picky, or maybe I'm cheap, but I can't see myself shelling out the money to own anything unless I plan on watching it five or ten times. And although this series is enjoyable and impressive, I just can't picture myself popping it in the DVD player a second or third time. (OK, maybe a second time. But not for every episode.) And I'm a huge fan of all things Apollo.

Perhaps if I'd watched this before reading Andrew Chaikin's ""A Man on the Moon"" (the main basis for this series), I'd have enjoyed it more. The nation may have only paid attention to Apollos 8, 11, and 13, but the rest of the program contained drama aplenty--Apollo 12's lightning strike, Alan Sheperd's triumphant return to space on Apollo 14, and the spectacular Lunar Rover explorations on Apollos 15, 16 and 17, to name but a few. Everyone knows that Apollo 13 didn't land on the moon; few know how close Apollos 12, 14 and 16 came to sharing the same fate. Chaikin's book excellently retells all of Apollo's forgotten epics, and ""From the Earth to the Moon"" attempts to bring that retelling to vivid life.

It partially succeeds.

Unfortunately, the meaty source material has been chopped up and pureed into TV-friendly nuggets; many of the best and most vivid recollections from the Chaikin book are absent or barely hinted at here. Presentation also suffers--the performances and the dialogue are solid and workmanlike, but rarely do the scenes provide enough information about the individual astronauts to really get inside their heads. After reading the book, one gets a feel for the distinct personalities of every astronaut who made the voyage, but after watching the movie, some of them come across as little more than empty spacesuits.

Many of the creative minds involved in this production (Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Brian Grazer) are victims of their own successes on Apollo 13--that movie did such an excellent job of recreating zero-G (by filming in actual zero-G conditions on NASA training aircraft) that these mini-movies suffer in comparison, feeling like, well, mini-movies. By clever use of helium baloons, this series gives its actors the ""bounce"" real moonwalkers had in 1/6th gravity, but it looks like they either didn't have the time or the budget to rent NASA's ""Vomit Comets"" again to duplicate zero-G for the orbital portions of the miniseries.

HBO did spend a decent amount of money on CGI, though, and it shows--perhaps too much. For a television series, the special effects are great. But some of the CGI scenes are just too crisp, too razzle-dazzle. If they'd been dirtied up just a touch, they'd have looked a lot more convincing; instead, they remind the viewer that they are watching something rather than living it.

Anyway, the amazon.com police might not like that I'm saying this, but don't buy this, unless you really, really, really, must own all Apollo stuff, or unless you want to sweeten Tom Hanks's wallet ever-so-slightly with whatever residuals he might be getting from this DVD set. Instead, buy Andrew Chaikin's book (if you don't already have it) and then, if you're still not satisfied, make the brave voyage from the earth to the video store.",1116720000,5,3239,4.901459854014599
43110,3,0783114222,"You know those TV shows that say 'based on actual events' - but not really the facts? This is one of those. Tom Hanks brings his over the top acting style to directing giving us a very soapy version on NASA history. The first DVD gives 10 minutes to Shepard's flight and a brief mention of space walking and docking - docking being one of the MOST important achievements. The remaining hour + is about the Apollo fire, showing supposed 'behind the scenes' arguments about safety vs staying on schedule, the publics right to know vs NASA keeping their game face. The show spend a disproportionate amount of time on what in reality was a small setback in the space race and it tells us nothing about the science and enginering that went into getting to the moon.",1113350400,3,760,4.5144927536231885
43111,3,0783114222,"The storytelling is excellent. The subject matter is fascinating and inspirational. Truly incredible filmmaking. Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is just terrible! The image quality is shockingly bad with distracting levels of pixelization. As much as they spent producing this series, you'd think they could make the stunning visuals transfer to DVD without these kinds of artifacts. They dropped the ball on the last step on this one.",1111017600,8,435,5.507462686567164
43122,4,0783114222,"On the whole a very strong series, but not without some bothersome issues.  For example, the episode on the near disaster of Apollo 13 split time recounting the actual story with the tale of a fictional news anchor's career crisis in the face of a young reporter's unscrupulous journalism.  If the story detailed a crisis Walter Cronkite had at the time of the mission, I would not take issue with it.  But for the incredible story of Apollo 13 to take a back seat to a fictional melodrama is as wasteful as it is useless to anyone who bought the series to learn about Apollo.  The message it sends to me is, ""If you really want to learn about Apollo 13, forget our mini-series and go watch the movie Apollo 13 instead.""

I am also annoyed with the third episode, which uses the clich device of storytelling through the eyes of a documentary team (which I presume to be fictional, as well).  Yet another example:  the final episode, ""Le Voyage Dans La Lune,"" robs an otherwise tasteful series conclusion by accounting an early 20th century French filmmaker who made the first sci-fi picture about moon travel.  Fortunately the picture he made, sharing the episode's title, is a real movie that was really shot during the early 1900s.  However, in the context of 11 other episodes solely about the 1960s-1970s U.S. space effort, I find that the French filmmaker story does not fit well with the overall theme of the series.

I might also add that for the most part, the actors don't really resemble the original astronauts.

But the story still has some extraordinary moments.  I (and it seems many other reviewers here) absolutely loved ""Spider,"" the episode of Grumman Aerospace's seven-year ordeal overcoming the challenges in making the LEM moonworthy.  Matt Craven's performance as dedicated Grumman project manager Tom Kelly was fantastic.  ""Galileo Was Right"" is another home run, showing that sometimes a good teacher can make all the difference in the world...or on the moon.  The stories of the tragic Apollo 1 and triumphant Apollo 11 are very strong in their own right, as well, accurately fleshing out their respective stories in great detail.  Part 11 deserves attention, too:  ""The Original Wives Club"" tells of the important but often overlooked lives of the women who kept their astronaut husbands' lives together.  They were companions and mothers, but also spokespeople for their husbands and the space program, and they were publicly-scrutinized American icons.  Very well-done.  Part 7, ""That's All There Is,"" is most people's favorite episode; it's the story of three friends who went to the moon on Apollo 12, perhaps the closest of all the Apollo crews.

What makes the whole series remarkable is not the stories of Apollo 1, Apollo 11, and Apollo 13, but rather the untold tales of the Grumman and North American folk who designed the LEM and Command Module, the flight controllers, the pad leader Guenter Wendt, and the astronauts of the later, forgotten Apollo missions.

At its worst, ""From the Earth to the Moon"" has plenty of annoying fiction and melodrama that takes time out from the ""good stuff"" in the series.  Fortunately, DVD players come with fast-forward buttons.  At its best, it's a top-notch tale that brings not just the stories of those on the front line, but also those of the many thousands who made Apollo come true.  Despite its flaws, it's a very good series, and I strongly recommend it.",1106611200,11,3435,4.870912220309811

My cousin still has a largre blown up picture of Gus and Gordo standing in the cockpit of of ""Miss Firebird"" as the boat was known.

A couple of my other cousins still have the small plastic key chain ""Mercury Capsules"" that Gus Grissom gave them when he visited here to look over he and Gordo's boat while under construction.

43125,5,0783114222,"For centuries, man had dreamed of going to the moon. It was only through the stories of Jules Verne and George Melie's ""A Trip to the Moon"" that we were able to venture to that celestial body that is the Moon. But between 1968 and 1972, nine missions from NASA's Apollo Space Program traveled the 200,000+ mile distance to the moon, bringing alive the dreams of Verne, Melie, Robert Goddard, and many others.

Tom Hanks' ""From the Earth to the Moon"" is a riveting and exceptional miniseries that covers, for the most part, the missions that took us on that thrilling adventure to another celestial body. The program takes you back to that time when mankind's dream became a reality. It features superb performances (too many great actors to name) and excellent production values in all areas involved.

While the whole miniseries is a classic, the standout episode is '1968,' which deals with Apollo 8. After eleven months of hell (The Tet Offensive in Vietnam, the Riot at the Democratic National Convention, the assassinatons of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, and so much more), the world stopped to watch the first three men make the historic first orbits of the moon. This episode makes it clear: Apollo 8 saved 1968 from being a terrible year overall.

""From the Earth to the Moon"" is an exceptional miniseries. Those who view it will not be disappointed. It truly was ""the most hazardous, dangerous, and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked."" Grade: A+",1097625600,8,1478,4.83399209486166

Each story has a different focus, so as you go through the history of the program you get to see it from a lot of different perspectives.  One story shows what the astronaut's wives went through, another shows the training the astronauts had to go through in geology so that they would be able to pick the best rocks to bring back for study.

One episode shows a veteran space reporter and his battles to cover the Apollo 13 story without bothering the families of the astronauts who were in danger, while his young competitor did whatever it took to get the story.

43129,5,0783114222,"HBO's ""From the Earth to the Moon"" (E2M) is everything a good docu-drama mini-series should be. Tom Hanks has brought to life the true story of man's greatest adventure to ""land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth"". For those of us who were alive, E2M allows us to relive those incredible days. And for those who were born afterwards, it gives them a chance to understand exactly what it was they missed. If you have even the slightest interest in the space program, obtaining a copy of this DVD set is a must.
Coincidently, Apollo 11 landed exactly 35 years ago today. I was 13 years old at the time and living in Nova Scotia, Canada. The ""Eagle"" touched down at 5:17 pm, much to the consternation of my mother who was busy trying to prepare supper. Just like Tom Hanks would later relate, I had my models of the Command Service Module, Lunar Module and Saturn V rocket close at hand while I had claimed the living room armchair for the occasion. My family gathered around our old B&W television which was tuned to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), one of only two stations which were available to us back then. Much of the CBC's coverage consisted of a feed from CBS, so we got to watch Walter Cronkite's famous ""Oh Boy!"" commentary. My prized 3"" reel-to-reel tape recorder (you could get all of 1 hour on a single reel) was busy taping a local radio station carrying NBC's coverage with Jay Barbree.
The entire family congregated again a few hours later for the moonwalk, just before midnight, and watched Neil & Buzz's first steps. I stayed up for the entire 30 hour televised stretch, from lunar landing to liftoff, stealing a moment every now and then to go outside and gaze up in wonder at the moon, filled with awe that two human beings were actually there, living and working on its surface. In this day of CNN and other all-news networks, it should be remembered that the coverage of this event was in itself history in-the-making - TV's longest continuous coverage of a planned event.
My interest in space began with the flight of Apollo 8. When I heard that this was the first manned launch of the world's biggest rocket, the Saturn V, I was sure that one of its million parts would go wrong with disastrous results. Thank God it didn't. I watched and I was forever hooked. A real space junkie, religiously watching each mission after that, coaxing my Mom to let me stay home from school (recurrent cases of ""moon sickness"", no doubt), clipping out every newspaper, Life, Time or Newsweek article I could find (now faded yellow with age) and trying to tape as much of the audio coverage as I could (few private individuals could afford a video recorder back then). By Apollo 14, I had earned enough money working at a grocery store to buy a 4-track 7"" reel-to-reel recorder (which allowed one to put up to 12 hours on a single tape!) and had built a 15"" Heathkit color TV. For Apollo 16, I had added a new-generation ""cassette"" recorder to my arsenal (don't forget that the venerable 8-track was still popular at the time). And, of course, I had acquired a VCR by the time the first Space Shuttle flew in 1981. It has always annoyed me that the more recording resources I could afford, the less TV & radio coverage there was available to tape.
But the effect of the Apollo program on me was profound. Because of it, I entered into a career in radio astronomy, enjoying the technical challenge of building instruments to investigate deep space from the Earth, perhaps recognizing the likelihood that I would never have to opportunity to leave its surface (although I did make the first cut for the Canadian Astronaut Program nearly 20 years ago). In tribute to Project Apollo, we named our son (now 16) after astronaut David Scott who commanded Apollo 15, my favorite of all the lunar flights.
In many ways, I feel sorry for the children of today - they will never experience the monumental awe and global celebration that we were privileged to witness back in 1969. Strange, isn't it, that although Apollo - the pinnacle of mankind's technical achievement - which occurred only 35 years ago is now looked on as though it was something out of our deep past rather than a part of our future. It's almost treated like it was a chapter out of ancient history, similar to other great accomplishments like the building of the Pyramids or the Great Wall. Although it might not seem so today, 500 years from now the moon landings will undoubtedly be remembered as the most significant event to have occurred in the 20th century.
It's hard to choose my favorite E2M episode since they were all so good. As an engineer, ""Spider"" resonated well with me, portraying the passion and dedication which many of us put into our work, albeit for projects with a much lower profile. ""That's All There Is"" brought back fond memories of the Apollo 12 mission. I distinctly remember there was talk at the time that astronauts Conrad and Bean may have been on an accidental oxygen high. It's good to know that there effervescent behavior on the surface was just a manifestation of their normal high spirits and comradery. I was delighted at how ""Galileo Was Right"" was able to present the training of the astronauts to be field-geologists in such an entertaining and informative manner. And finally, the bittersweet ""Le Voyage Dans La Lune"" brought a tear to my eye, just as happened back in 1972 when I watched Apollo 17 and the last lunar module lift-off from the moon. It's even sadder still, that we have not returned, nor will we for perhaps another 20 years.",1090195200,19,5577,4.611670020120724

At times when it seems like the episodes should be searing, and dramatic, they instead wax sentimental.  The music is also rather unremarkable, with the exception of Brad Fiedel's fine contribution to the installment ""We Interrupt This Program.""
For all of that, Hanks, and company manage to pull off the gargantuan feat of illustrating for us, the trials, and the victories that were Project Apollo.  Considering the amount of material that had to be covered, they do so with finesse, and unwavering aplomb.

43131,3,0783114222,"As the series begins it becomes apparent that every aspect of the Lunar Program will be shown which is a welcome sight since next to nothing is usually mentioned about the other missions especially the last one Apollo 17.  The attention to detail really pulls you in and you are drawn into the individuals that made up the program.  Unfortunately, the series does drag on and the repetion of lunar landings gets as tedious as I believe they must have been to the public, hence the end to the program.  Also, their are very Ron Howardish scenes of people making final speeches in honor of different things and this contrasted with the realism of the technical scenes.  But the worst thing about the series has to be the damn music.  I am not of fan of film score unless its for some over-the-top epic adventure, but when dealing with real people in real situations, this bombastic mess can completely get in the way.  Now the good news; stand out episodes in order include (forgot some titles): Spider, 1968, Mare Tranqualitis(although Buzz Aldrin was shown as a bit of a whiner), Part 1, the Last episode, and Apollo One .  Original Wives Club was good except for the last scene between the Lovells. It seemed straight out of a TGIF sitcom.  The rest of the episodes seemed to blur together especially the geologist one, I understand they wanted to make the science intresting but I've seen PBS do better.  This may all seem negative but I did give it 3 stars, its just that compared with the best thing I've ever seen on television, ""Band of Brothers"", this series seems like just a good effort.

43142,5,0783114222,"The praises of this series have been sung by others, and I heartily recommend this DVD to everyone, but I would like to make a few points, some of which are negative, but which don't detract from the immense value of this series.
(1) Without the development of the giant Saturn V Moon rocket, man never would have gotten to the Moon, and yet its development, unlike that of the Command Module and Lunar Module is not dealt with and yet its story was just as dramatic.  The problem of ""combustion instability"" and its solution is very interesting and took the lives of some excellent engineers but it is not mentioned.  It is interesting that Wernher von Braun, the head of this effort is barely mentioned or shown in the series, whereas he was a very visible P.R. man for the space program in the 1950's and 1960's.  I believe the producers of this series were aware of von Braun's past as a Captain in the dreaded Nazi SS and his possible (not proven) role in the war crimes involved in the production of the V-2 rocket in World War II and they didn't want to bring up this controversy.
(2)  I give great credit to the producers for the episode about the development of the Lunar Module and the other episode showing how the astronauts were trained to become proficient geologists on the Moon.  Science and engineering are usually not interesting for the television viewer, and yet these things were made quite interesting.  My only complaint is that the engineers
who worked on the Lunar Module are shown to be a bunch of lovable ""nerds"" who view the work as recreation, but in reality many engineers gave their lives as heroes, just as did the Apollo 1 astronauts, because of the immense stress due to the time pressure.  Others survived but had the marriages and family lives ruined.  None of this is really shown.
(3)  The actors who played Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first two men on the moon, played by Tony Goldwyn and Bryan Cranston, put in especially superb performances.  Aldrin, the troubled genius, was especially well portrayed by Cranston who put in a lot of time studying Aldrin before filming commenced.
(4)  The episode about Alan Shepard and Apollo 14 was quite good in showing how the flight controllers and the support teams led by Don Eyles overcame the Abort Switch malfunction.  Here real-time problem-solving was shown.  I was, however, disappointed that the Apollo 16 mission was not really shown because they had a more serious problem with the back-up Service Propulsion System which
also had a problem and was quite solved in a similar way.  The Apollo 16 crew's exploration of the Descartes-Cayley site would have been quite interesting too because it was quite different than expected.
(5)  The episode about the end of the program in Apollo 17 was both good and bad, the bad part being the story that Tom Hanks appears in about the filming of the early 20-th century movie about a flight to the Moon.  This was just a waste of time, in addition to the slander against Thomas Edison. There were more important things to show, in my opinion.  However, the end of the episode leaves me with tears in my eyes, because of all that had been accomplished in such a short time, and was then allowed to be thrown away because of short-sightedness.  I hope that the Presidents recent decision to go back to the Moon will be carried out because Mankind needs to look to the future and to continually expand his horizons.",1075680000,8,3450,4.646381578947368
43143,4,0783114222,"Yes, yes - it is uneven, but that's part of why this miniseries is so good. Tom Hanks, Ron Howard and friends were smart enough not to merely recycle ""The Right Stuff"" and ""Apollo 13,"" but to experiment with different stories and different viewpoints and visuals. As the majority has commented, great pains have also been taken to cover more than the ""highlight reel"", and be more historically accurate.
Some of the standouts:
""Apollo One"" covers the tragic training exercise that killed Gus Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White. Interestingly, I have never seen Mark Rolston (Grissom) in a sympathetic part before, and here he plays one of the most revered astronauts of the entire space program! Both here and in a later episode, the engineers behind the spacecraft are profiled - one of the most intriguing and interesting parts of the whole series. Engineers and designers are so rarely given credit or shown to be ""cool"" or even dedicated, kudos to the producers for doing so.
The episode ""1968"" mixes disturbing and compelling real-life news footage to show the prevailing chaos that year. The skillful editing really gives you a sense of the paranoia that reigned that year, with MLK and RFK being assassinated within months of each other, as well as the Chicago DNC riots.
Bryan Cranston and Tony Goldwyn crackle in their roles as tense Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong. The next episode is a relief: Dave Foley is very, very funny, along with Tom Verica and Paul Crane as the 'also-rans' of the Apollo program.
Overall, it's just a pleasure to see the different approaches. Even when it falls flat a bit, the producers deserve so much credit for taking chances here.
I disliked the third episode, mocked up as a '60s documentary (it came off as way too polished, rather than the astro ""Medium Cool"" it apparently was meant to be)... And the episode with reporter ""Emmett Smith"" being sucker-punched by a young and hungry Jay Mohr wasn't as strong as it could have been, since we hadn't seen so much of ""Smith's"" personal side up until then, although he is one of the few constants through the many episode. If they had developed ""Smith"" as a character more, it would have been much more effective. Both cases were more critiques of the media than dramatic storytelling or historical reenactment.
Kudos also for paying attention to the heavy burden carried by astronaut wives - many of whom had already paid dues as test pilot wives. The original novel ""The Right Stuff"" is absolutely poetic on the same topic.
Note: A below review claims that the Russians sent an ""unqualified woman"" into space. Ouch! Sounds like selective history. Actually, the Soviet Union has had a long history of female aviators, namely the famed ""Nacht Waxen"", bomber and fighter pilots who fought during WWII. The Soviets even had two female aces, both of whom died in combat.
When the Mercury group was picked in the US, men with aviation experience were selected. Only a few, like Gus Grissom, were also scientists with advanced degrees. (Today, very few astronauts are primarily military-trained pilots, with most of them being literally, our brightest scientists.)
Likewise, Valentina Tereshkova was a parachutist, which is why she was one of the three women initially selected to train as a cosmonaut. After the training and poking and prodding she received, just like the Mercury astronauts, it's hardly fair to call her ""unqualified"".
Laika the dog was unqualified, but not Tereshkova. Geez.
I suppose that because she was an industrial worker, her parachuting experience was slighted by the reviewer, even though communism often sent bright, but socially unconnected men and women into factories and menial labor.
Ironically, the US had many qualified women pilots - Jacqueline Cochran, a record-breaking test pilot springs to mind - but waited until 1983 to send a woman into space.",1075420800,8,3893,4.9632465543644715

It was so well done that even its deficiencies can't reduce its overall impact: 1) the Apollo 13 segment was much less about that mission rather than the media circus around it (hint: watch the movie ""Apollo 13"" instead). 2) Von Braun's contributions only get passing mention; I would have liked to see more about the development of the Saturn Rockets.",1073779200,4,665,4.981981981981982

So by the time of the death of manned space exploration, I was having my First Communion.  Then came along ""The Right Stuff"", a film that truly had THE RIGHT STUFF and made me hunger for more to learn about the history of space that occured during my lifetime.  Then came ""Apollo 13"", showing that people did not give a darn anymore about space, unless it was a matter of life or death, and this gave impetus to the star of the film to take the same quality of ""The Right Stuff"" and ""Apollo 13"" and do the best possible in showing the entire story of travels ""From the Earth to the Moon"".  This along with growing up with the PBS series from Carl Sagan, ""Cosmos"" gave me a great love for aerospace.  I graduated from High School soon after the Challenger exploded, and as a 35 year old retired and disabled adult the Columbia was lost.  But I hope that this is not the death of manned space missions, and the return to manned space exploration will occur hopefully with a permanent return to the Moon, perhaps outposts on Mars, and beyond.",1070064000,,1146,4.331775700934579
43147,5,0783114222,"Thank you Ron Howard! Obviously you touched a national nerve with the outstanding ""Apollo 13,"" and took that concept and extended it into this wonderfully filmed and acted semi-documentary account of the NASA of the 1960s that was seemingly unstoppable.
In this film the actors do yeoman's work, and come across as the enigmatic guys they were: serious yet pranksters; competitive yet team players; in command yet able to follow orders. The beauty of this, of course, is that is exactly the truth. Conrad and Bean come across as great buddies, Armstrong comes across as a hyper-competent, serious and retiring test pilot and everyone else seems similarly true to form throughout the series. My hat is off to the actors: they nailed it.
Another favorite feature of the series for me is the evenhandedness, rather than an almost exclusive focus on the 'Biggie' missions (Apollo 8, 11, and 13) that are most commonly dealt with in film. They are adequately addressed, but so are many other equally dramatic events that seldom enter the public's consciousness. A perfect example is the depiction of the stuck thruster incident encountered by Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott on Gemini 8, in which a thruster sent them tumbling in all three axes, and which became so severe that only Armstrong's quick thinking was able to salvage the situation before they blacked out due to excessive G loads. According to some inside NASA it was this quick thinking that earned him the CDR spot for Apollo 11. Of further note are the special effects, which, similarly to ""Apollo 13"" are excellent. (Try watching the Gemini 8 segment on a big screen TV and not feeling queasy and nervous.)
Overall a super job. I have heard some people say that this is too long and others that it's too short. Obviously the producers can't satisfy all tastes (and being a serious Apollo-phile, it could always be longer for me) but in general I think they got it just about perfect. If you have any interest in the Apollo program, or spaceflight in general, this is an excellent effort that you should definitely own.",1068940800,9,2078,4.839887640449438
43148,5,0783114222,"- Facts are real, has plenty of information about what probably is humankind`s greatest achievement. The mix of real footage and amazingly created ones add to its real life/documentary spirit. But it`s far from being a documentary, although every fact is real. It goes beyond on the narration.
- It`s not ""Americana"" on its spirit. Mr. Hanks and his team deserve merits for showing this great achievement as a mankind victory instead of an ""America only"" feat. Congratulations!
- Each episode is presented thru an original point of view, not the one you`d expect. This gives new life to the facts. The Apollo 13 episode, for example, shows how an anchor man from a TV network faced his drama at the same time as the astronauts. A great achievement since if it was presented the other way it would fail when compared to the movie. Actually, one complements the other.
- Many generations have not lived the man on the moon. This is the best way to give them a small feeling of what that meant. It`s the closest an historical document can get to emotion. Anyone will learn great and funny facts from the Apollo project and its missions.
- Episodes are very successful in passing the feeling of this great achievement. You`ll be proud of it, specially if you happened to be alive when it happened. At the end you`ll regret the fact that today we (humans/nations) spend too much time and energy with small problems that don`t take anyone anywhere.
- On the latest episode you`ll learn that one of the century`s ""greatest"" men was, actually, the first pirate whose actions screwed the life of the first great filmmaker.
- Mr. Hanks talents go far beyond acting. Congratulations!
- Acting is amazing, direction perfect, screenplays compelling. You won`t believe this was ""just"" a 12 episode TV miniseries. It`s FAR better than many movies made on science fiction/space exploration genres.
The only point where they`ve sleeped:
- The box and its opening ""book"" scheme doesn`t feel it`ll be up to date when man reaches Mars.
I`d like to remind you all that this is not a science fiction miniseries. Its focus is on the spirit, the challenge, the emotions, the technology, the men and women involved on taking the man on a voyage from the Earth to the Moon.

43149,5,0783114222,"When I was in the first grade in Orlando, Florida our class would go outside to watch the Mercury flights take off from Cape Canaveral, so the American space program made a big impression on me as a child.  Of course, now I have a daughter who is surprised to learn that human beings have walked on the moon while I remember ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" being interrupted by a news bulletin about the fatal fire that killed the crew of Apollo 1.  My father was stationed in Japan for most of the Apollo flights, so except for Apollo 11 we did not get to see a lot of what everybody saw back home.  Consequently, for me ""From the Earth to the Moon"" is a combination of vague memories and new information.

Having also watched ""Band of Brothers,"" the other HBO documentary in which Tom Hanks had a significant hand, I am struck by how these two mini-series have essentially redefined the term more towards its original meaning.  Unlike landmark mini-series such as ""Shogun"" and ""Winds of War,"" where each episode picks up the main characters pretty much where they were left at the end of the previous episode, ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Band of Brothers"" clearly offer up distinct episodes in telling the story of the Apollo space program.  The only constant characters are really Eugene Cernan (Daniel Hugh Kelly), the astronaut who ended up heading the program, and the fictional television anchorman Emmett Seaborn (Lane Smith), who represents an amalgam of all the newscasters who were big boosters of the space program (such as Walter Cronkite).

Most of the episodes focus on a specific Apollo flight, but there are also episodes on different topics, like the development of the lunar module.  There are episodes that of surprising comedy, such as when the crazy Pete Conrad (Paul McCrane) takes Al Bean (Dave Foley) and Apollo 12 to the moon, and one devoted to the pathos of the shattered lives of the wives of the third group of Astronauts.  The episode on Apollo 13 is interesting in how it effectively avoids covering the same ground as the movie.  We never see the astronauts, we only hear their voices, and since we all ""know"" the story now the focus of the episode is to show how the space program was confronted with the ""new"" brand of journalism that was not going to be spoon fed information and heroes by NASA.  However, my favorite was the episode in which Lee Silver (David Clennon), a professor of geology, teaches the astronauts how to read the story of rocks as the test pilots being sent to the moon learn to be ""scientists.""  There are lots of familiar faces in these episodes (the proverbial too many to name), but for those who remember the indelible bad boy characters created by McCrane and Clennon on ""E.R."" and ""thirtysomething,"" there is a special joy in which them play good guys.

""From the Earth to the Moon"" is not as informative as a documentary, but it certainly focus on the actual nuts and bolts of sending men to the moon.  Actually it does this in a rather engaging manner, and the way in which it combines NASA technology with human drama is one of the strengths of the mini-series.  Almost all of the astronauts come out of the series with their images as heroes intact (providing you do not ask their ex-wives), the exceptions being Buzz Aldrin (Bryan Cranston), who really wanted to get out on the moon before Neil Armstrong (Tony Goldwyn), and Alan Shepard (Ted Levine), who we always knew was the grand old S.O.B. of the space program.  But even so both men merely come across as being decidedly human.  Whether you actually were around at the time to go outside and look up at the moon knowing there were a couple of Americans walking around hitting a golf ball, picking up rocks, and dropping a hammer and a feather at the same time, or this is all just history come alive, you should find this an excellent series of adventures in and about outer space.",1059782400,80,3904,4.6103896103896105
43150,5,0783114222,"In this stunning portrayal of the greatest period of exploration in human history--and it should be said that the Apollo program was nothing less than that--two great themes permeate the tale:
1.  the compelling nature of the quest to voyage from the Earth to the Moon.
2.  the power & value of human intellect and education
The concluding episode has a scene in which the character who links the episodes together, the fictional TV anchor Emmett Seaborn, observes--correctly, I think--that we went to the moon simply to take those awe-inspiring photographs; to prove to ourselves that we could do it.  The other reasons for the Apollo program, to beat the Soviets, and the other political reasons and scientific, were secondary and perhaps even trivial when compared to the sheer compulsion to do it, a compulsion energized by what may have been President Kennedy's greatest single speech, given in 1962 at Rice University, the speech in which he challenged & committed the United States to send a man to the moon & return him safely to Earth by the end of that decade.
The other great theme, that of the value & power of the intellect, was wonderfully illuminated by the portrayal of the field geology lessons given to a number of the Apollo astronauts by one Professor Lee Silver of Caltech.  It is not often that intellectual endeavors are portrayed in popular dramatic productions.  But it was the geological exploration of the Moon which gave those voyages--especially the last few--invaluable scientific results and a focus of activity for the astronauts while on the lunar surface.
Viewing this series ""From the Earth to the Moon"" reminded me of  how fortunate I am to have lived during the time of the Apollo missions, the truly great adventure in the history of mankind.",1056499200,4,1780,4.916666666666667
43151,5,0783114222,"I'm watching this miniseries for about the fifth time (it's great to NordicTrack to). Each time I watch it, I am more impressed.
First, it works as a dramatic narrative. The History Channel it ain't! The drama centers around the usual ""people at risk"" conflicts, but it derives as much of its energy from the aspirations that drove the people to put themselves at risk. It could easily have collapsed into cheap sentimentality or jingoistic patriotism, but instead, it inspires.
Almost as importantly, it doesn't compromise its history to tell its story. I am personally very tired of producers who excuse bad history by saying ""we're making entertainment, not a documentary."" If you're good enough, you can make great entertainment that is great history. This miniseries is a mavelous example of just that. I think that what I enjoy most about the series is that it's as much about the 1960s as it is about the Apollo program. We went through incredible social changes during that decade, and 'From the Earth to the Moon' touches many of them.

43162,5,0783114222,"What can be said about this?
Tom Hanks got the bug for Space doing ""Apollo 13"" and took it to greater heights with this fantastic portrayal of the people, times and achievements of the Apollo era. On one hand this gives a detailed technical account of how Man first set foot on the Moon. But it is more than that, giving an understanding of the effects on the wives, reporters, back room staff, astronauts, scientists, engineers and other people of the hundreds of thousands that made Apollo possible.
Some aspects are universally known, such as the aforementioned Apollo 13, and so are given a different twist. Others are little known and therefore welcome a more detailed portrayal. Each mission is used as a backdrop to plot a particular storyline. Alan Shepard's Meniere's Disease. The reporting of missions changing from, in some respects, friendly cooperative to hostile intrusive reporting. The hard lives of astronauts wives. The Apollo 1 fire. The difficulties in America in 1968. All are carefully and effectively portrayed.
Particularly enjoyable - as a spacecraft engineer and scientist myself - are the episodes about the development of the Lunar Module (partly, I think as the Grumman engineer Tom Kelly got a particularly bad deal during ""Apollo 13"" and Hanks wanted to say sorry), and those about the geologists Silver and El Baz who taught the astronauts how to observe the moon, not just see it.
The whole production is based considerably on the Andrew Chaikin book ""A Man On The Moon"" which has become the definitive account of the Apollo program.

It was obvious that HBO did not have the bankroll to snag Digital Domain, the same people who did ""Apollo 13."" (To steal a quote from another space film: ""No bucks, no Buck Rogers."")

I've read almost all of the books written by astronauts, flight directors and outside observers, like the one that was the basis for this series written by Andrew Chaikin.  The series is fantastic, especially in the DVD format, which really brings the sounds and pictures to life.
I have several favorite episodes in the twelve-part series.  The story about the catastrophic Apollo 1 fire, which killed three astronauts is extremely touching and well acted.  The Apollo 12 episode explores the friendship that is forged between three men who experience something very few people will ever get to do in their lifetimes.  That episode, which includes a fine performance by ER's Paul ""Rocket Romano"" McCrane, is extremely fun.  Alan Shepard's Apollo 14 flight episode also was enjoyable as well as the episode that chronicles the historic Apollo 11 moon landing.  This latter episode is great in that it does an excellent job of exhibiting the tension that took place between Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin about who would take the first steps on the moon.
There were only two episodes that I found to be less than average, including the story of the Apollo 13 flight.  I certainly understand that they would not want to rehash the events in an episode when there has been a terrific movie made about this ill-fated voyage.  But I thought that focusing the attention on a battle between an old school (the terrific Lane Smith) and a new school journalist (the annoying Jay Mohr) just wasn't interesting to me.  I also actually didn't care for the final episode which focused half on the Apollo 17 mission and half on the making of an old time movie about landing on the moon (with Tom Hanks in the lead role of a French director).

43197,3,0783114222,"I feel other reviewers have been a little too kind to this product. My friend taped this series when it was first shown on HBO. I watched his tapes and enjoyed it very much. It aims at greatness and almost hits the target. Hanks probably told this story as well as it could be done while still maintaining historical accuracy. When I saw this on DVD at Blockbuster, I had to rent it for a second look. For me, it does not hold my interest as well the second time around.
Additionally, I was slightly disappointed with the DVD picture quality. I had just seen the Sex and the City first season DVD set, where the picture quality was great. The DVD of From the Earth to the Moon is definitely a step down from there. The colors seem a bit desaturated (except in special FX scenes), everything slightly defocussed, and there are often ""moire"" patterns (I think this is what they are called) in areas of the picture where there are black and white lines close to one another. The special effects scenes seem to be sharper and better looking than the normal photography. I'm not sure why. HBO should remaster this as pennance for not lavishing the care on mastering this material that it deserves. And let people trade in the first edition for the properly mastered one.
The package is very good. But I can't possibly give it 5 stars -- that would put it in a category with works of art like Lawrence of Arabia, or Vertigo. No, it is not THAT good -- let's be realistic.
And the less than stellar (no pun intended) quality of the video must take away another star. So this is how I arrived at three stars. If I was allowed, I'd give it three and a half stars. If we are to have any perspective about this video in comparison to the entire universe (again, no pun intended) of great DVDs of great films, this is a completely fair rating.",1006300800,10,1831,4.372434017595308
43198,5,0783114222,"This set of DVDs brilliantly captures the lives of the astronauts and the world around them at the time of the Apollo missions.
The special effects are pretty awesome too. Historically, these are mostly accurate too, and give a real feeling of being there. It rekindled my memories of sitting watching the events on TV as a child as it was so realistic!
It is so sad that the series was shown at strange hours here in the UK. Most of my friends who have seen some of the footage have now gone to the expense of getting region free DVD players and the US edition of the DVDs. This series is so good it becomes an obsession! This is by far the best work Tom Hanks has done for humanity - documenting history that historians seem to want to forget!

43210,5,0783114222,"Having read Andrew Chaikin's ""A man on a moon"", I learnt that Tom Hanks had produced this HBO mini series and I was eager to see it. And what I saw was absolutely captivating. This film is exactly the kind of stuff one likes to discover when passionate about the race to the moon. Questions like: how do we undertake a voyage to the moon; what kind of problems had to be solved to conceive a spacecraft able to land on the moon; how does an astronaut inside a lunar module put on a spacesuit - and many others - are answered throughout these 12 enthralling episodes. The enthusiasm of Tom Hanks and of all his staff for this amazing space adventure can be felt all through the film. A special mention must be made here for the episode depicting how Prof. Lee Silver and ""The King"" Farouk El Baz succeeded in turning fully accomplished pilot-astronauts into very skilled explorers of the unknown. Along with Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" and Philip Kaufman's ""The right stuff"", this HBO miniseries is a ""must"" for all Apollo nostalgics.",1004572800,2,1030,4.572972972972973

43212,5,0783114222,"What makes this one of the best programs ever to watch on your DVD:
 - Facts are real, has plenty of information about what probably is humankind`s greatest achievement. The mix of real footage and amazingly created ones add to  its real life/documentary spirit. But it`s far from being a documentary, although every fact is real. It goes beyond on the narration.
 - It`s not ""Americana"" on its spirit. Mr. Hanks and his team deserve merits for showing this great achievement as a mankind victory instead of an ""America only"" feat. Congratulations!
 - Each episode is presented thru an original point of view, not the one you`d expect. This gives new life to the facts. The Apollo 13 episode, for example, shows how an anchor man from a TV network faced his drama at the same time as the astronauts. A great achievement since if it was presented the other way it would fail when compared to the movie. Actually, one complements the other.
  - Many generations have not lived the man on the moon. This is the best way to give them a small feeling of what that meant. It`s the closest an historical document can  get to emotion. Anyone will learn great and funny facts from the Apollo project and  its missions.
 - Episodes are very successful in passing the feeling of this great achievement.  You`ll be proud of it, specially if you happened to be alive when it happened. At the  end you`ll regret the fact that today we (humans/nations) spend too much time and energy with small problems that don`t take anyone anywhere.
 - On the latest episode you`ll learn that one of the century`s ""greatest"" men was, actually, the first pirate whose actions [messed with] the life of the first great filmmaker.
 - Mr. Hanks talents go far beyond acting. Congratulations!
 - Acting is amazing, direction perfect, screenplays compelling. You won`t believe this was ""just"" a 12 episode TV miniseries. It`s FAR better than many movies made on science fiction/space exploration genres.
 The only point where they`ve sleeped:
 - The box and its opening ""book"" scheme doesn`t feel it`ll be up to date when man reaches Mars.
 I`d like to remind you all that this is not a science fiction miniseries. Its focus is on the spirit, the challenge, the emotions, the technology, the men and women involved on taking the man on a voyage from the Earth to the Moon.
  it`s far from cheap. But worth every cent.",1000425600,3,2383,4.71256038647343
43213,5,0783114222,"This is an expensive boxed set, and it would be natural to wonder if a made-for-TV documentary is worth the price.
Don't worry, though; you'll get every penny's worth. This is nothing short of the definitive telling of the American manned space program through the Apollo program. It contains 12 hours of material, plus a disk of bonus materials.
The series uses a primarily dramatic retelling, rather than a factual presentation. This is used to great effect, as it better captures the spirit of the times. To get the general idea, imagine the Tom Hanks movie ""Apollo 13"" expanded to encompass the rest of the space program.
Some of the parts can take your breath away, as you re-live the challenges of the Apollo program and experience the awe of accomplishments that they made.",999561600,4,780,4.8283582089552235

43217,4,0783114222,"Awesome series, with first class Moon special effects, with some faults (they showed a Soyuz rocket start before Leonov's spacewalk, instead of a Voshod rocket , two different actor plays Pete Conrad), with very good actors, directors (for example Frank Marshall) and composers (Michael Kamen, James Newton Howard and Mason Daring for example). It is dramatic,exciting, interesting and  we can learn some really touching things about these heroes. Without doubt the best episode is the 'Mare Tranquilitatis' about the Apollo 11.
It is very kind from the filmmakers to finally show Mr. Werner von Braun who played a major role in the Moon program.  The moonlanding is truly a great success , not just for the Americans but for the whole world. For example I am very proud when I remember that a Hungarian engineer (Ferenc Pavlics) designed the Lunar Roving Vehicle. And as we can see in this series it functioned very well :)
It would be very interesting if somebody finally made a mini series (or movie) about the Russian space program (at that time) and we can see that spaceheroes weren't born just in the US, but in Russia too...",991094400,14,1132,4.860103626943006

When 'The Right Stuff' came out I waited impatiently for some kind of follow up, but it never came. Until now. Finally, after Ron Howard's wonderful 'Apollo 13', we have this extraordinary series. We get to see the Astronauts, their families and Nasa management as something other than two-dimensional history book figures. Myself and many others cannot express our gratitude enough for the existence of 'From The Earth To The Moon'. The series gives good coverage of the Gemini program which often tends to be overlooked, although a portrayal of the remarkable events of Gemini 6 and 7 would have been welcome. I know that there was only limited running time and budget to show certain missions. But more details of the near-mutiny of Apollo 7, the white-knuckle events of Apollo 10 and the problem solving of Apollo 16 could have been important additions to the series. Perhaps one day someone will make a long-overdue movie or series about Yuri Gagarin and the eventful Russian space program, Skylab and the Apollo-Soyuz mission. And one day, someone could tell the tales of the early Shuttle program and the Challenger tragedy. Manned spaceflight has many tales left to tell. But for now, 'From The Earth To The Moon' is a magnificent and very comprehensive start. Hey, Mr Hanks: You should follow Dennis Tito on the next available Soyuz to the Space Station.

43256,5,0783114222,"First off, if I could give this miniseries 10, 20, a zillion stars, I would.  Amazon just didn't let me count high enough.
So let me get ahold  of myself long enough to tell you to run, run, run and get this DVD set  now, if you haven't already.  ""From the Earth to the Moon"" is one  of the most unique and engrossing (as well as gorgeously produced)  miniseries I've ever seen -- 12 hours of moving, dramatic, gripping,  frightening, and ultimately completely inspiring entertainment.  As a kid  born in the late sixties, I missed the moon race (and I'm still ticked  about it).  But this literally perfect 12-episode miniseries makes me feel  as if I've been there too -- from the tragedy of Apollo 1 to the triumphs  and near-misses of the ensuing missions, to the vastly underappreciated  final Apollo 16 and 17 missions. (As one character in the film laments,  ""We stopped going up just when we were getting really good at  it."")
Those of you who might have avoided this because it's  ""history"" -- let me reassure you right now that it's as gripping  as any drama you'll see in or out of a theatre.  This isn't just history  painstakingly created by some of those who were there -- it's also just  plain incredible, suspenseful, joyful entertainment.
And for those of  you who saw it on HBO, the DVD set is well worth the price, even if you'd  already taped it. The DVD set offers not only crystal-clear viewing you'd  expect (and the special effects hold up admirably under the discerning eye  offered through DVD), but also special features including an enjoyable  making-of featurette (emphasizing Tom Hanks' huge role in bringing the  project to the screen), plus behind-the-scenes studies of special effects,  3D ship models (which can be rotated or even viewed in wireframe), a  transcript of Kennedy's ""We Choose to go to the Moon"" speech, a  follow-up quiz, and a virtual tour of the solar system.  And that's just  for starters.
The writing, acting, music, direction and more are all  simply superb -- each hour out of the twelve having its own particular look  and feel, while nevertheless meshing perfectly with the others. The  introductions to each chapter in Apollo history are delivered quietly, but  with eloquence and power, by the project's producer, co-writer, actor (and  driving force) Tom Hanks.
One of my favorite aspects of the project was  the way it brought in so many actors who are often underused (or at least  under-appreciated) in TV and film today -- many of whom are cast against  type to show what they can really do.  Stephen Root, a guy I'd loved as  Jimmy James on NewsRadio for years, does a terrific job in a serious role  as Mission Control's Chris Kraft, as does Nick Searcy in a quiet and often  sensitive turn as the program's father figure Deke Slayton.  Meanwhile,  Stephen Root's former NewsRadio news director Dave Foley also gets in on  the action, and gets to shed his ""Kids in the Hall"" cynicism with  a surprisingly sweet and innocent portrayal of Al Bean.
Other favorites  out of the dozens of amazing actors include Ted Levine's wistful, complex  (not to mention curmudgeonly) Alan Shepard, the criminally underused Jo  Anderson's sensitive and moving Pat White (wife of Gemini and Apollo I  astronaut Ed White), and memorable appearances large and small by such  gifted folks as Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Matt Craven, Tim Daly,  Mark Harmon (returning for a few moments to his lighter roots), Paul  McCrane, David Clennon, James Rebhorn, Mark Rolston, Jay Mohr, George  Newbern, Brett Cullen and Steve Zahn.
The surprises are the best part.  Before viewing this, I would never have guessed that the Apollo 13  (""We interrupt this Program"") segment, while unique and powerful,  would be my least favorite of the group, while ""Spider,"" a look  at the development of a *machine*, for goodness' sake, would move me to  tears.  Other standouts (keeping in mind that they're all terrific) include  a quietly powerful look at Apollo I, the trials and surprising fates of the  astronauts' wives in an episode directed by Sally Field, and the  bittersweet old-man-as-underdog battle of Alan Shepard to make it ""up  there"" one last time -- and for more than 15 minutes.
OK, I'll shut  up.  But if you ever have a day when you've encountered a really stupid  driver, or been detained in ridiculous meetings with half-brained bozos, or  wondered if human beings aren't actually DE-volving -- then this miniseries  is just the kind of thing to remind you of what human beings can be at  their very best. And what wonders they are capable of.
And I can't  believe I missed it all.  We just better go back.  Darn it.
NOTE: For  those of you inspired by the miniseries, I strongly urge you to go pick up  Andrew Chaikin's wonderful ""A Man on the Moon,"" the history of  Apollo that provided much of the backbone for the miniseries.  And for an  even closer look at the moon, don't miss ""Full Moon"" (Michael  Light and Andrew Chaikin) -- a truly stunning, beautiful, even eerie  compilation of lunar photographs, many of which had never before been seen.",965779200,347,5102,4.784562211981567

For those that are younger, it takes a  committment to get through all the episodes, but they will learn much and  reap great rewards.  For those of us that were actually alive during the  Apollo years, who watched as NASA unfolded a dream for us, Tom Hanks and  HBO take us where we only dreamed.

43258,5,0783114222,"I really have to say that the money spent on this item are probably the  best investment I have ever made. This series achieves the goal of blendig  tecnical accuracy with historic perspective and with human's emotions. What  is really interesting about this series is that, using entirely new and  very realistic visual effects, it succeds in explaining the whole  experience of the Moon Race. In this area it is way superior to any of the  ""original footage"" documentaries on the subject, since those were  limited to the video footage actually brought back from the moon. (i.e.:  How do you explain how the astronauts piloted the lunar module to the  surface of the moon using original footage, when the only thing avaiable is  footage from a camera with a narrow angle mouted on top of the LEM!?). And  I am not talking about the tecnical details! I am talking about the fliying  experience!! How do you land 240.000 miles from home, with no runway  lights, with a vehicle that looks like a spider and on a surface that you  don't know wether it will hold once you tuched down!?
The series is  structured in several episodes, each one about a particular milestone in  reaching the Moon or a particular Moon mission. Once an aspect of the  flight is shown, the attention in the following episodes shifts to other  aspects, so that it is never repetitive.
On the TECNICAL SIDE it  does a nearly perfect job of describing the challenges of going to the moon  and the hardware used to do it. The nice thing is that it achieves this  goal with stunning visual effects and brief explanations in the form of  dialog between the characters, leaving deeper details to further reading by  the viewer. I personally got immediately interested in the subject and  ended up reading a couple of books on the moon program. (the cool thing is  that going back to the TV series once I read some literature, I realized  how realistic and historically accurate it was!!).
On the HISTORICAL SIDE  it does a great job in putting the Apollo program in perspective. I believe  that this is very important since the choices that were made at the time  cannot be fully understood if the competitive, tecnological and political  enviroment are not taken into consideration. This is done by including  original media coverage of the event and by including a sense of urgency in  the decisions made by the caracters. We all of course know how the story  ended, but at the time of the first lunar landing the russians were still  very much part of the game!
And on the EMOTIONAL SIDE the series does a  nearly perfect job in describing what it must have been to go to the moon  as an astronaut. Being a pilot myself I was so much fascinated by the  feelings that were transmitted thru the visual effects, the soundtrack and  the dialogues. I really felt as if I was behind Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin  in the LEM during the first lunar landing.
My suggestion is very  simple:  1- If you are interested in the Moon program buy it now! What r u  waiting for!? 2- If you are even remotely interested in the Moon race buy  it even so!! You will be more interested afterwards, I guarantee! 3- If you  are not interested in the Moon program and you believe that the money spent  on Apollo were a complete waste...well...buy this miniseries and you will  soon be advocating for a return to the Moon and the exploration of Mars!!",962582400,6,3393,4.59866220735786

Each episode is wonderful, providing accurate  information about the Apollo space program within the framework of vivid  storytelling.  The acting is top notch; it's hard to believe these guys  didn't actually go into space themselves!

This is pretty much  a documentary but its all acted out as if it were a movie, something which  i wish i would see more of.
The series is on 3 dvd's with a forth full of  extras. You learn about everything that went on from the first man in  space, to that last man to walk on the moon. This is one of the best  special interest dvd's I own. Its a must have for any space buff.",959212800,,580,3.721311475409836
43262,5,0783114222,"This is, by far, the most awe-inspiring and breathtaking video I have ever owned. ""From the Earth to the Moon"" chronicles America's determination, pride and dedication of sending a man 250,000 miles to the surface of moon. HBO, Tom Hanks, Andrew Chaiken and a cast and crew of so many others, have put together a 12hr miniseries, broken into one hour segments that tells and visually shows you the hard work and bravery of the astronauts, engineers, NASA administrators, and even politians like President Kennedy, who have struggled to put the smartest men in the world onto the face of the moon and safely back to earth before the end of the decade. You will get to know, intimately, each astronaut, the wives of these brave men, and the men and women behind the works of the most powerful and sophisticated engineering of the time. After watching this, I am sure you will have a tear-jerking appreciation of this painstakingly accomplishment and give praise to all the customer reviewers who have given this no less than FIVE STARS.

43265,5,0783114222,"HBO has done a superb job in telling the story of ""the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventures on which mankind has ever embarked."" - JFK. With a cast of hundreds and a staggering budget of  close to 70 million, Tom Hanks and HBO have woven together stories from the  Apollo program into one 12-episode miniseries.
The first episode,  ""Can We Do This?,"" begins with the early years of American space  exploration. Alan Shepard's heart stopping Freedom 7 flight is skillfully  portrayed and Ed White's first Gemini spacewalk is seen. It really is a  great beginning. ""Apollo 1"" gets right to the point. Within 5  minutes after the start of the episode the fire occurs. Most of the rest of  the episode chronicles the investigation with the Apollo 204 Review Board  and the clash between Harrison Storms and Joe Shea. It's got a really neat  ending, probably the best of the series. ""We Have Cleared the  Tower"" follows the Apollo 7 crew training all the way up to the launch  as seen by a documentary crew filming the mission. If you want to know what  it's like before a mission, this is the episode for you. ""1968"" I  honestly thought was the worst episode. A lot of it is just a bunch of  stock news footage from '68 and it keeps switching from color to those  annoying black and white shots. However, this episode survives because  later on it has an excellent scene as the Apollo 8 crew witnesses the first  earthrise seen by humans. The episode also has some great in-flight scenes  while the crew is in lunar orbit. ""Spider"" is by far one of the  best. It has a good story mixed with a little dose of humor. It's really  interesting seeing all the work that went into the lunar module and the  Apollo 9 flight. This one also has a great ending. The only bad thing is it  gives only 30 seconds devoted to the Apollo 10 mission. ""Mare  Tranquilities"" is a great episode, but could have been better. I got  sick of the interviews mixed in with different scenes. It isn't until the  end that you see the actual mission, when Apollo 11 is already in lunar  orbit. But the episode is still good because of the fast paced landing and  the goose-bump filled first step. It's a scene you can't get enough of.  ""That's All There Is"" is a fun one. The Apollo 12 crew was best  friends and it showed. This episode is one of the most enjoyable and is a  great one to watch with friends, especially if you are the only space buff.  Astronaut Al Bean narrates the episode. ""We Interrupt This  Program"" follows the press covering the flight of Apollo 13. The  producers were creative and did not show any shots of the crew in space  except at the beginning. The reason for this is because they did not want  to compete with the movie Apollo 13 and they wanted something new and  different. ""For Miles and Miles"" is another one that could have  been better. It's got a slow start but a good ending. The episode follows  Alan Shepard's road to return to the flight rotation. ""Galileo Was Right""  is a great one. It is interesting and fun as you watch the Apollo 15 crew  go through geology training and eventually go to the moon and drive the  lunar rover. One of the best. ""The Original Wives Club"" has not been one  that I have watched over and over. It tells the astronaut wives' story and  what went on behind the scenes while the astronauts were training for the  Apollo program. It has only about five minutes worth of Apollo 16 footage,  which was a disappointment. But it is an interesting one. ""Le Voyage Da Na  Lune"" has to be the most creative episode there was. Mixing scenes of an  early 20th century film crew filming a movie about a science fiction voyage  to the moon as well as Apollo 17 footage. It also features interviews with  the ""astronauts,"" which are actually the actors who played them, speaking  of Apollo. It ends with parts of Kennedy's speech and the astronaut's names  scrolling across the screen.
From the Earth to the Moon has to be the  best thing HBO has ever done. The accuracy makes it seem almost like you  were there in the 60s and 70s, watching as mankind voyaged to another  world. I have watched many episodes almost a dozen times because I can't  get enough of it. If you are interested in Apollo or even if you lived  during Apollo and want to re-live the adventures, then get this now. You  won't be disappointed.",952732800,56,4359,4.466327827191868

It saddens me, as a British film-maker,  that Britain no longer has the imagination or the ability to make such a  series... Thankfully, there are still real film-makers in the States and,  using the talents of so many skilled and gifted people, they made this  unmissiable series...

43287,5,0783114222,"Until the movie Apollo 13 came to the screen, many were unaware, or had forgotten of that event, or of the many facets, the visions, the energies that made up the American Space program in the 1960s. A program with a  dictate set forth by President Kennedy: to get men to the moon, and return,  safely,  before the end of the decade.
This 12-hour (12 x one-hour  segments) tribute is the personal mission of two-time Academy Award winner  Tom Hanks, a man with a childhood love for the astronauts and the space  program, and a man with enough clout to get this big-budget extravaganza  made.
Each segment is in and of itself a story, each with a different  point-of-view on the major aspects of the program. Certainly the main  events-the first manned flight, the Apollo 1 fire, the lunar landing, the  Apollo 13 emergency, are all there. But quite differently than what we've  seen previously, here we have an opportunity to relive much of the  day-to-day, aspects-the politics, the personalities, the emotions, of many,  many of the key individuals. The astronauts, the engineers, the  administrators, the news people, the wives-they all get wonderfully  recognized.
Since I'm about the same age as Mr. Hanks, I admit to being a  space freak myself as a youngster-at the time these events actually  happened. At that time I waited every week, for Time, Newsweek and Life  magazine to give me the pictures, and accounts of the activity at  NASA.

As a whole, the series is a wonderful  adventure and a great history lesson.  Cameo appearances by many, many well  known character actors enhances the fun.  A few of the episodes really  stand out as special, but the entire series is more than worth watching.

No detail is overlooked, from the bolt of lightning that  struck Apollo 12 shortly after liftoff to the Apollo 15 crew testing the  law of gravity by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather on the lunar  surface. After watching every episode several times, I had mixed feelings.  First, I am glad that I was alive during the time that we sent astronauts  to the moon, and this video brought back a lot of memories for me. But I'm  also sad that there haven't been more trips to the moon for some 28 years  now, meaning that a whole new generation has grown up only knowing about  the moon landings from archival videos.

It is not an exaggerated display of patriotism but  rather it shows the by now gone enthusiasm of the time. You will understand  and appreciate how many people and little pieces had to work together to  get people to the Moon. You will end up wishing that the current space  program would get at least half as much enthusiasm as the Mercury / Gemini  / Apollo program did.

7789974,5,0783114222,"The discs come in a plastic snap case. They play fine.

From the Earth to the Moon (1998) is terrific. I love period shows that take a little history and make it dramatic fiction, in other words, they breathe life into the subject, make it interesting. Two highlights in the series are episode 5, which has the best music from an old sci-fi show titled Fireball XL5 (1962-1963), and episode 6, which shows the first moon landing.

However, From the Earth to the Moon is more of a glorified documentary than fictional drama. The series uses a lot of black and white and grainy color footage and jumps back and forth between those and good color footage. I enjoyed some other space race stuff listed in the next paragraph as much or more than this series.

I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From the Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

You might also like Manhattan (2014-2015), Granite Flats (2013-2015) or Taken (2002). All three series are set during WWII or shortly after. They are about secret government programs. Manhattan is about making the first atomic bomb, like the movie Fat Man and Little Boy (1989). Taken is about UFOs and alien visitors, sort of a fictionalized version of Project Blue Book. And Granite Flats is about the experimental drug program MKUltra (the CIA mind control program).

All of the above series have great story arcs. They start and finish strong and have great middles. One difference is the smoking and drinking. There is smoking and drinking in almost every scene in Manhattan, which was set during the era when soldiers received packs of cigarettes with their meal rations. Ever been around a chain smoker? In Taken theres a scene where Crawford says his doctor prescribed cigarettes for hypertension. Imagine that. I don't remember any smoking in Granite Flats, but that might just be my poor memory.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,3082,5.07905138339921
