The characters in the movie were down-home people.  I wish there were more feel-good movies made like this.",1531267200,,286,4.3584905660377355

8578776,4,B00C8TZNH6,"I got this rather expensive import for my mother as a present for her 80th birthday - this is the first film she remembers seeing, though it turned out when watching it that she remembered the book more.  While it was an enjoyable enough film, I guess I can understand why it's of limited interest and doesn't have a domestic disc available; it's very much a movie that will have appeal to horse lovers and serious nostalgists, but probably not to a wide general audience.

Based on the novel by Mary O'Hara, this was adapted from the third novel in the trilogy that begins with ""My Friend Flicka"" and continues with ""Thunderhead.""  The story concerns two families of horsemen, the McLaughlins and the Greenways, who become rivals on the trotter circuit after young Ken McLaughlin (Robert Arthur) acquires a top young mare and sets himself up to compete with the prizewinner owned and driven by Beaver Greenway (Charles Coburn, far too old and fat to be believable as the driver of a harness, but he's a great enough character actor that I at least can forgive this eccentricity).  Beaver has a daughter Carey (Peggy Cummins, who can't or doesn't try to disguise her Welsh accent here - another odd touch in the film) and of course there's the beginnings of a romance with Ken, or might be if this wasn't as chaste as a Disney film.

Major complications include Ken's stern father (Lloyd Nolan), and especially Thunderhead, a wild stallion who keeps trying to steal Ken's prize mare Crown Jewel away.  The main problem with the film for me is that it just had very little drama; it's all pretty obviously going to end without a whole lot of tension, and everything is fairly predictable even to a guy who stays away from horse movies like me.  But the presence of old pros Nolan and Coburn makes up for some of that, and we also have Burl Ives on hand (sans beard but you can't mistake his voice for any other) narrating, singing, and playing the role of the McLaughlin's hired hand (foreman?  it wasn't that clear). And the Oscar-nominated color photography and on-location shooting are indicative of a fairly expensive and lavish production for the time, and they are certainly shown to great advantage.

In summary, if you love horses or any of the main cast, this is certainly worthwhile, and it's not a bad watch for others, for the lovely photography and scenery - it was actually shot in Wyoming and Utah, not so common in the late 40s.  Hardcore Marilyn Monroe fans also should look out for it - she's an extra in a square dance scene.

The transfer is bright and vibrant, one of the better-looking color ones I've seen from this era, so if you want just this film don't hesitate; it's also available in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flicka/dp/B000LXHJZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flicka</a>&nbsp;box set which for most folks will be the way to go.",1381708800,,2904,4.846464646464646
