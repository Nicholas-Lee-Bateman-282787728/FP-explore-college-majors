4171930,4,B003QTBT0M,"Yes, it's a parody of ""Zombieland"" - but there are actually fewer plot holes, fewer slow spots - and a heckuva lot more zombies.  I wasn't expecting much, but was VERY pleasantly surprised at how good this film really is.  It may be low budget, but I can't see that much difference between it an ""Zombieland"" in that respect, either.  To be honest, if I had to recommend either... I'd go with Stripperland!  It's quite funny, gets in some zingers and cast-off references to zombie films abound.

Jamison Challeen steals the film. Really hope to see him in a lot more films.",1330732800,3,573,4.578431372549019

4171932,3,B003QTBT0M,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- The great tragedy of Stripperland! is that it could have been a really great film. The idea of the undead (strippers or not) laying waste to the country while a small group rides the roads is a sound one. The actors play their roles effectively, especially for a low-budget horror/comedy. The gore effects are top-notch, with a decent mix of digital and practical grue hitting the screen at regular intervals. The only problem is, Zombieland beat them to it. Oh, and Zombieland just happened to be one of the better horror comedies of all time.

That leaves Stripperland! as an unofficial remake, essentially. Aside from a few humorous additions (mostly in the form of cameos), Stripperland! follows Zombieland's template. I guess it's a parody because the zombies this time are strippers (and as one character rather painfully points out, that's ironic because it's a male fantasy to have a country full of strippers, but in this case they're strippers who kill). Thus, viewers have little to do except look for differences between Stripperland! and its better (like the fact that Stripperland! uses state names instead of city names for its characters, Frisco excepted), or note the occasional nod to other zombie films (like a painful ""I'm coming to get you, Barbara"" rehash and a retooling of Dawn of the Dead's famous tagline to include stripper poles instead of hell).

At least everyone involved gave it their all, as demonstrated by this DVD. The 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer looks about as good as a film of this budget can, with decent black levels and solid color saturation. It's a little rough around the edges, but totally watchable. The audio track does a fine job keeping dialogue clear and well balanced with the largely-metal soundtrack. Extras are impressively extensive. They start with a pair of commentary tracks. The first includes director Sean Skelling, writer Ben McCray, and editor David Wester, while the second include the effects team of Christina Kortum and Austen Healy. Everyone seems happy with their work on the film, and Skelling is especially effusive in discussing his baby. The effects team does a great job of giving peek at the creation of the numerous effects shots throughout the film. Then comes a trio of featurettes that cover the effects, the cast, and the cameos from Stripperland! These includes interviews supplemented with behind the scenes footage. Then there are 9 minutes of deleted scenes and a blooper reel. Then we're treated to a pair of music videos, one from a band on the soundtrack and another of Daniel Baldwin rapping in character.

There are a few reasons to watch Stripperland! If you have an irrational hatred of Woody Harrelson and/or Jesse Eisenberg, then watching Stripperland! might be an acceptable substitute. For a low-budget film, Stripperland! has an impressive number of women in hot pants and/or naked to its credit, for those looking for a little nudity with their zombie. Finally, the cameos can be genuinely amusing. I especially enjoyed Lloyd Kaufman's, but Daniel Baldwin and Linnea Quigley also earn their paychecks.

Stripperland! might have just enough blood and breasts to warrant a rental for low-budget horror-comedy fans, though there's no way it can stack up to its namesake. The extras, however, are really impressive and that makes Stripperland! a slightly more tempting package.

4171933,3,B003QTBT0M,"Some film critics have criticized Stripperland! online, either for its lack of nudity or for it being a shameless rip-off of Zombieland. But it's not bad. Unfortunately, it's not great either. It's not action-packed and it isn't consistently funny, either. It's supposed to be a spoof of Zombieland, but if you ask me Zombieland had more humor. What Stripperland! does have is gore galore (although much of it is CGI), and amusing ""celebrity"" cameos from Daniel Baldwin as a rapper, Lloyd Kaufman, and Linnea Quigley as a gun-toting grandma named Grambo. If you are a b-movie fan, I don't see how you could outright hate Stripperland! It does deliver the b-movie goods. It just doesn't deliver as much as a lot of other movies of its type. It's certainly not in the same league as Zombie Strippers. But it's worth a rental, if you've seen most of the other zombie comedies out there.",1308009600,,883,4.777777777777778

This film was fast-paced with unexpected twists. And though I didn't expect high-brow in this low-brow flick, I found myself laughing at philosophical jokes, such as, why scantily clad zombies were coined 'stripper' instead of monster. I was thrilled to see Linnea Quigley (Return of the Living Dead) clean up the zombie scum. Daniel Baldwin ghetto rapping was an added laugh.

4171961,1,B003QTBT0M,"Stripperland (2011)

 Experienced Zombie flick fans will recognize the name Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Productions fame and will not need to read further.  For the rest of you, this movie exemplifies all that we find hideous in cheaply made Zombie films.  Billed as a comedy, it brings no laughs to our bellies, no smiles to our face.  Like much (or all) of Troma Productions output, Stripperland is beyond rubbish, it rates more like what you scrape off your shoe if you step into something nasty.
 The acting, although not at all brilliant, we can accept as ranking in the green zone for low budget Zombie films.  I have seen much worse.  The concept isn't all that bad.  A generous person might call Stripperland an homage to Zombieland or an even more generous person might call it a satire or parody of that infinitely better film.  A more realistic person might conclude, as I do, that the makers of Stripperland just lacked the imagination to do better and were just too careless and lazy to try.  These guys didn't set out to make a good Zombie movie and fell short.  They set out to make a pile of crap to sell to 13 year olds for their lunch money.  I think they failed even at that.
 I admit to having some surprise that writer/director Sean Skelding put his actual (or at least his professional) name on this thing.
 This film (a lose use of the word) carries a strong R rating for numerous topless shots of blood covered lady Zombies and more or less constant shots of lady Zombies dressed like strippers.  The gore, while plentiful, is done for laughs not for terror.
 James Challeen as Frisco and Maren McGuire as Virginia turn in performances that we can appreciate and are the only reasons to see this terrible film.  Poor Maren McGuire does double duty as a Zombie that Frisco blows away with a shotgun.

4171983,2,B003QTBT0M,"It wasn't completely bad for a parody b-flick.  The actors were decent and there was a few funny gags.  The movie could have been a cult classic if they would have cut about a half hour to an hour out of it.  Many of the scenes really didn't flow right and were tacked on with duct tape and bailing wire.  A good parody should flow from one scene to the next with a story that matches it's own.  Stripperland around mid-movie it really started to discard it's own story flow just to match scenes out of Zombieland.
I really think the director could have saved this movie from being a snooze-fest and even made it a great movie had he gotten bolder and put more film on the cutting room floor.  Well that and didn't try so hard to match the original.  Seriously this movie skates dangerously close to being considered a knockoff.  Which is frustrating because I think there was enough cheesy material that they could have pulled from from their story premise to hold their own.
If for whatever reason the writer of the script reads this comment, the next parody you write put more of your own ideas into the story line rather than follow the original your parodying.  People will get it.  Look at Zucker movies. He will match a key situation in a scene as the original movie and than just completely destroy it in the most hysterical way possible.  A couple of times you really nailed it. Like the tripping scene.  Loved that!  But the fat guy G.G. that got shot scene... the whole scene was awkward and didn't make sense.  The attempt to match the Bill Murray's scene in Zombieland was just a really bad idea.  Clearly the Frisco guy could hear the others giggling and you would have had to be blind or mentally impaired to think a old bald fat guy is a stripper.  It needed a 1st person camera shot from Frisco and some weird coincidental point-of-view that makes the old guy look like a stripper would have made the scene believable.  But it would have had to be a absolutely hilarious delivery of a punchline in order to save that scene after so much dull lead-up time.  The scene totally didn't work AT ALL.
But the movie had more lagging scenes than comedy nuggets.  I wouldn't recommend this movie.  But there are worst B-flicks you can torture yourself... start here: [...]  :D",1400198400,2,2284,4.481840193704601

I have to admit, I did not see this one coming. It just never occurred to me when I didn't see the Asylum's logo anywhere on this that it was going to end up being a Zombieland mockbuster. Silly me. But by the time we hit their take on the running Twinkie gag from that far, far superior movie, I knew there was no way this pile of tripe was going to be able to rescue itself from the latrine it had dug itself. Unfortunately, I was all too right.

Plot: ...well, if you're anything like 95% of the rest of the world, you've already seen Zombieland. Just make the undead all strippers, add in a horrific Daniel Baldwin cameo as a rapper whose music causes zombie strippers to stop attacking people and just listen, and leach out all the character development and caustic wit that made Zombieland such an excellent film and you get this low-rent take.

4172005,1,B003QTBT0M,"I like a bad ""B"" horror movie but this was more in the realm of a ""Q""  horror movie (Q for questionable).  Usually these movies at least make an attempt to find attractive women to up the hot factor in order to cover up the horrible plot and acting.  I think they cast every knarlly washed up hooker they could find.  Don't waste your time!",1379808000,,340,4.184615384615385

4172007,2,B003QTBT0M,"Well, it was ""free"" and that's about the best thing I can say for the movie. I vaguely remember seeing this somewhere else, or at least part of it somewhere else and turning the channel.

The movie is exactly what you think it is. It's a play, sort of, on Zombieland, and strippers are everywhere and they are zombies. Nothing earth-shattering here. No acting breakthroughs, nothing.

Watch if you have no other way ""to kill"" and hour and a half.",1378252800,,446,4.5625

4172014,4,B003QTBT0M,"This film is a spoof on ""Zombieland."" If you have never seen ""Zombieland"" the enjoyment value of this film will be greatly diminished. Like ""Zombieland"" this feature has our two heroes travel across the country and are later joined by two women. Their eventual goal is to go to Portland, Oregon (ground zero for strippers) and seek out Granmbo (Linnea Quigley). Benjamin Sheppard is our Jesse Eisenberg, Jamison Challeen is our Woody Harrelson.

In addition to spoofing ""Zombieland,"" this film smartly satirizes the relationship between men and strippers and unreal expectations that mankind shares.

There is plenty of Troma style blood and guts. The extras show a bunch of women immensely enjoying making this film. This is a fun film to watch, especially right after ""Zombieland.""
