1142624,3,7885885127,Not bad older films but a little slow  for me and not as good as the cat people but worthwhile for your Val Lewton collection.,1384905600,,126,4.04
1142625,4,7885885127,"This movie is most notable for being the introduction of the outstanding actress, Kim Hunter, to the screen. She plays a character younger than her actual age but does a fine job for a novice. For people who know well the period in which this movie was made, the era of double features plus short subjects, coming attractions and newsreels, there will be familiar faces playing brief character roles and Tom Conway, who followed his brother, George Sanders, as  The Saint, and was one of the most noted of B picture stars. The plot involves young Kim's  character searching for her sister who has been supporting her in school but is now missing from her usual haunts and whose whereabouts are not known to people who knew her.
The acting is typical of quality programmers (as they were called), the plot designed for easy apprehension in the shorter period allowed for the movie, and the direction brisk and designed to tell the story in the time allowed.
The movie appears in a number of collections (see the Val Lewton ones) and is worth seeing if the price is right.",1376784000,,1070,4.656084656084656
1142626,4,7885885127,"The 7th Victim is one hour and ten minutes and was released in theaters on August 21, 1943. The story starts of when Mary if summoned to the office of a boarding school where she is attending and finds out that her sister Jacqueline Gibson has not paid the bill in months. Mary quits school and heads to New York City to find her sister. She seeks help from Gregory Ward, a lawyer, to help find Jacqueline. It is somewhere in the middle of the movie that Jacqueline was part of a devil occult and left. The group philosophy is no killing, but six members in the past have left the group and wind up dead; therefore that is where the title of the story comes from. In the end though you are left guessing whether or not she did it. I am not going to say what it is or I would be giving away the rest of the movie. Just like the last three movies are kept on you seat till the end of the movie to find out the whole story. In this movie you might recognize a young Hugh Beaumont who would go on to fame as Fred Ward on Leave It to Beaver. Also include with this DVD is a fifty - three minute tribute\biography to Val Lewton which includes interview with his son Val Jr. and Sara Karloff, Boris Karloff's daughter. The 7th Victim gets a B+.

1142627,5,7885885127,"""I runne to death, and death meets me as fast, and all my pleasures are like yesterday"" (""Holy Sonnet"" VII Jonne Donne.)

Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter) is called to the office of here boarding school. There she is confronted with the fact that her sister is missing; the person who tells this is Mrs. Lowood (Ottola Nesmith) the person who runs the school. Now where have we heard the name Lowood before?

As you have already guessed Mary fearing something is afoot, is compelled to locate her sister Jacqueline (Jean Brooks). On her quest she meets various characters, all wanting to help her. We must guess whether they are good guys or have nefarious motives. One such character is Doctor Louis Judd (Tom Conway same name and similar character used in ""Cat People"").

Will Mary find her sister?
On the way will Mary find true love, at what cost?
Why the seventh victim, who were the other six?

Yes I know this is a Val Lewton production and if it is his best or worst, this film has his signature of being more psychological than supernatural. That is why this film is more than just a who-done-it.",1363478400,,1097,4.553299492385787
1142628,3,7885885127,"[...]

Despite the unusually short running time, this morbid low-budget suspense story moves very leisurely. Not much really happens at the placid, almost somnambulist pace  and still they manage to fit in some unnecessary stuff!

The combination of incongruous intrigue, noirish atmosphere, and muted melancholy creates an eerie enjoyability, though. Maybe in my book.",1359849600,,369,5.796296296296297
1142629,5,7885885127,"Martin Scorsese recently released his list of the 11 scariest movies.  ""Isle of the Dead"" was #2.  I'd never seen that one and I wanted to see what made it so great, so I bought the two-DVD set which included Isle and I Walked With A Zombie.

I wish I had bought this DVD first, because the Shadows of the Dark documentary gave the background necessary to fully appreciate Isle of the Dead, as well as Lewton's other movies.  The commentary includes insightful remarks by Val Lewton's son, as well as modern horror masters like Guillermo del Toro, William Friedkin, Kim Newman, Neil Gaiman, and Robert Wise.

The Seventh Victim doesn't always make narrative sense, but that's not why we watch Lewton's movies.  They're mesmerizing, not just because of the tension, the fear that's instilled in us, but because they happen in our world.  Like one of the commentators said, Lewton doesn't take us to another universe.  The characters live in our reality, and what happens to them could happen to us.

I highly recommend this, as well as the other double-DVD sets.",1350777600,3,1061,4.754098360655738
1142630,5,7885885127,"Val Lewton became famous for his series of 9 stylized ""horror"" films for RKO studios. He took the horrow genre to a different level by replacing monsters for the fear of the unknown. His last film in this series, according to sources, was to be an A picture with the stipulation that lesser known Mark Robson be replaced with a name director. The story is Val Lewton was loyal to his friends and this film kept Robson as director and stayed a ""B"" film. With that being said, THE 7TH VICTIM is highly stylized and as cinematically equal to any of the film noir films of the 40's and 50's. THE 7TH VICTIM is not a horror film but rather a suspense thriller to the highest degress.
Mary Gibson's sister mysterious older sister Jacqueline has gone missing. Young and innocent Mary leaves her boarding school to search for her sister in the big city. Murder soon becomes a pawn in a desperate search by a cult to find Jacqueline. Murder, mysterious men in the night and a strange cult follow her through her search. I saw that a young Kim Hunter was in the film and I could not recognize her and finally learned she plays Mary. Definitely a different role for her from STREETCAR NAME DESIRE and PLANET OF THE APES. Another surprise was seeing a very young and dashing Hugh Beaumont from TV'S LEAVE IT TO BEAVER. Character actors seen in the other 8 Lewton films are sprinkled into this final motion picture.
There is suspense and fear in this movie..nothing supernatural. The fear is real and springs from the heart of evil people. Much of the film is in shadows..again the fear of the unknown is highlighted. A scene catching Mary alone in her shower when some enters the room clearly must have inspired Alfred Hitchcock's shower scene in PSYCHO.
THE 7TH VICTIM is truly a model of suspense and fear and should not be missed.
This disc also includes the documentary  SHADOWS IN THE DARK THE VAL LEWTON STORY. Once you have seen his films, you can't miss this documentary that delves into the life and mind of the remarkable Val Lewton. No doubt he inspired generations of filmmakers and writers with his films.",1347235200,4,2106,4.571428571428571
1142631,5,7885885127,"7th victim is a great subtle horror film. While the story is more melodramatic than Lewton's others,key story elements were creeping their way through the movie. One is the walking down a street while in danger. This plot devise was used in most of his films in one way or another. This story involves devil worshippers and starts out as a missing person set up.
The actors do an excellent job on a well shot beautifully put together film. Since the release of these Lewton films on DVD I hope all serious film lovers and horror lovers take advantage of owning and viewing the  movies. This film was the first in a seies of films that are still wonderful to view even today.",1343088000,4,674,4.479674796747967
1142632,4,7885885127,"Engaging, eccentric but low-budgeted and short film that yet seems to have been influential. About a young woman at a boarding school whose older sister seems to have disappeared. She decides to leave the school to find her in New York City. Her search leads her to a group of white-collar satanists. Kim Hunter, who won an Oscar as 'Stella' in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE [1951], appears here in her first film. She plays the young woman and is well cast---her wholesome countenance and fragile innocence reminding one of a young Judy Garland. She appears a bit stolid at times but, then again, this was her first film and her occasional underacting seemed to add to this dour, morbid little film. There are two GREAT psychological horror scenarios in this. First, a mouse-faced private detective and the young woman have a lead as to her sister's whereabouts. They break into a factory in the wee hours of the night and the private eye is mysteriously murdered. The frightened lass descends into the NYC subway system and boards a train. After a round-trip ride back to the original station where she boarded a trio of late-night drunks enter her car. Two of the rubber-faced, leering 'drunks' are carrying their dissipated, limp, drinking buddy, arm-to-arm, between them and they sit across her. To her horror, the guy in the middle is the dead detective. Second, the eerie shower conversation. While showering Hunter is surprised by one of the female satinists who tersely warns her to stop searching for her sister and return home. The dialogue is done through the shower curtain with the dark silhouette of the visitor's head and hat resembling a deformed beast with horns, or use your imagination. Very haunting and macabre. Both scenarios an example of brilliant, innovative and insightful psychological horror by Val Lewton & Co. Lewton regular Tom Conway is very effective as the bleary-eyed, mysterious, what-is-he-up-to psychiatrist who knows where the missing woman is. He helps Hunter find her missing sibling who winds up being a member of the satanic cult but is trying to escape from the group. The older dude who seemed to be head of the coven and decides that big sis must die was unsettlingly effective. The film ends with the missing woman's apparent suicide. Geez, not the type of film you would lend someone who's down in the dumps. Deja Vu with the shower scene [PSYCHO, 1960], the topic of white-collar NYC satanism, paganism and psychological terror [ROSEMARY'S BABY, 1968, and EYES WIDE SHUT, 1999], the use of the murky NYC subway system to propagate psychological horror [JACOB'S LADDER, 1990] and the creepy but deft use of blank-eyes/stoic facies/static posture in members of a clique [INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, 1956; HORROR HOTEL, 1960]. A bit corny and contrived at the end as Hunter and her sister's spouse, played by Hugh Beaumont [series LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, 1957-1963], decide that after minimal interaction they're in love. Can't see the Beav's dad as a glib, two-timing bum. Also suffers from RKO's stingy, attenuating budget as you sensed a hurried ending and are left wanting more. Nonetheless, a stylish, singular film that clearly set some tables.

  As for the documentary SHADOWS IN THE DARK:THE VAL LEWTON LEGACY, it is NOT inferior to the touted, cable-TV viewed MARTIN SCORSESE PRESENTS VAL LEWTON: THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS which is sold as a separate DVD or included in the new Warner Brothers [WB] box set. In fact, I enjoyed watching the former most as it included some insightful feedback from some top directors not included in the Scorsese version. Both contain just about the same footage and almost parallel each other, providing an honest, sensitive tribute to Lewton and an engrossing view of the heartless Hollywood power and avarice subculture. Unless you are a serious Scorsese fan, I would recommend saving a few bucks and sticking with SHADOWS IN THE DARK included herein or you can have both by buying the new WB box set, as I chose to do. Both documentaries receive my highest rating of five star*s.",1265414400,6,4064,4.92992700729927
7900549,4,7885885127,"One of Lewton's more underrated films, ""The 7th Victim"" is an unconventional noir with much to offer. Beginning with the disappearance of Jacqueline Gibson (Jean Brooks) older sister of schoolgirl Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter in her first feature role) we are almost immediately immersed in the mysterious world of modern-day Satanists, a Rosemary's Baby-esque group of eccentrics who worship the Dark Lord's majesty and power. Mix that with garbled psychology as touted by Dr. Judd (Tom Conway) and you're in for a fair romp amidst the darkness lurking at the edges of everyday life. (And yes, the self-same Dr. J as seen in Lewton's ""Cat People."" Apparently he gets around.)

Mary leaves school to search for her sister among the shadows of a long-vanished Greenwich Village, NYC. She visits the cosmetic plant her sister owned only to discover Jacqueline has sold it to a Mrs. Redi (Mary Newton) who remains close-lipped and perfunctory with her explanation of Jacqueline's months-long absence. Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont), Jacqueline's SO, is also desperate to find her. Rounding out those who search for Jacqueline is Jason Hoag (Erford Gage) a poet stymied in his work for a decade following the disappearance of his true love and muse.

Subplots involve a detective (Richard Davies) and his demise, a morbid subway scene, and a shower scene predating Psycho by almost twenty years. As it is in Lewton's work small players make a big impression. Most noteworthy are dying neighbor Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), and beautician Frances Fallon (Isabel Jewell) whose devotion to Jacqueline hints of homoeroticism.

""The 7th Victim"" features a Lewton walk to end all Lewton walks interspersed with not one but two Lewton buses. The film is worth viewing for that alone and also for a look at statuesque Bettie Page ringer actress Jean Brooks. Not to mention the irony of the ending which boasts a twist on nothing other than the meanings of life and death, paganism and Christian virtues.",1500076800,,1981,5.0892307692307694

7900551,5,7885885127,"I consider 7th Victim to be Lewtons most effective effort, the darkness, the hangmans knot, the crummy detective slowly walking from the shadows with a knife in him, an almost suffocating aura of relentless dread....really the best quasi nihilist work by the director,"" a filmed nightmare"" (Dal Lazlo crime art expert)",1450483200,,318,5.254901960784314

7900558,4,7885885127,"I bought this because I had already purchased THE CAT PEOPLE several years ago and was curious about Val Lewton's other opus of film. he was considered a master of B horror cinema. I knew this one along with THE CAT PEOPLE and THE LEOPARD MAN was considered to be his trilogy of horror masterpieces. THE 7TH VICTIM was intentionally slow paced and has its redeeming moments and comprehensively a solid little film, though it isn't quite as appealing as some of his other work. it is still worth a look though.

picture and sound are both good.",1399852800,,543,4.540816326530612
