8560187,1,B00B04KV0O,"I am a big Ellen B. fan and thought that this might be a hidden gem. It isn't. I'm returning it for a refund.

In the first place, there is no duration time listed anywhere on the video, and there are no chapters breaking up the workout into segments -- both of which I think is disrespectful to the customer. I budget my time and I mix and match between videos to keep it different each day and to make sure I'm covering all the bases. The idea that we're just going to do this video from start to finish without regard to time (or having had to time and note it for ourselves for future reference) is not realistic. The assumption that segments don't matter and chapters aren't helpful is simply ignorant or lazy or both. This isn't Ellen's fault, it's the fault of the chap that produced the video series.

On to the exercise itself. You'd think that Ellen's presence would offer enough -- but she's in this weirdly over-lit room and wearing thick training shoes: not her style at all, and I doubt they're needed for any part of the workout. (Indoors, I always train barefoot -- as she normally does as well.) I didn't see the whole video because it bored me from the start: after some uninspired walky moves we did a static stretch -- or she did: I skipped it as unnecessary till the end of any workout -- and then fast-forwarded past other moves that didn't look interesting or progressive to me. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with them. But I've realized that simply stringing calisthenics together, one thing after another, does not an engaging workout make: and this is particularly clear when you compare this with Ellen's latest (the 7-Day Workout Challenge) which is unified by themes and goals. This is what builds energy, enthusiasm, motivation. Otherwise you find yourself asking: 'why these moves, why now, and why in this order?'. If I want to move for the sake of it I'd be better off pushing a vacuum around or planting some shrubs in the garden.

Love Ellen. Just not this one.",1483488000,,2009,4.5595567867036015
8560188,5,B00B04KV0O,"Love Ellen!  This work out, just like other Ellen Barrett workouts, does not disappoint! Great full body workout for women that slims/defines without bulking! Ellen rules!",1461542400,,171,5.576923076923077
8560189,5,B00B04KV0O,I love Ellen as an instructor and this workout does not disappoint.  It's deceptively challenging and a solid workout! I am thrilled with this purchase!,1442188800,,152,5.08
8560190,5,B00B04KV0O,"I have all of Ellen Barrett's workouts. She cues the next move before it happens so it is easy to follow along. Ellen has a pleasant voice and she is very inspiring. This is not the most difficult workout, but if you are looking for a lower impact, medium range workout, I would recommend this. Even if you are not a type B.",1430870400,2,324,4.158730158730159

Enjoying it",1430092800,,34,4.833333333333333
8560192,2,B00B04KV0O,I love Ellen but you have to have an exercise ball and strength bands to do the full work out.,1404000000,4,94,3.75
8560193,5,B00B04KV0O,"I got this workout because I like the instructor - not because of my blood type. Ellen Barrett has never disappointed and this workout is no exception. You get a great full-body workout, with enough reps to feel like you've done something. She shows you a combo, adds to it, does on the other side, adds to it again, repeats on other side, etc. Because of this, and her excellent cues, you can keep up. You do need equipment: sand weights (I have wrist weights, they worked fine), stability ball, and resistance band. Last part of workout is a fabulous stretch with the band. Throughout the workout she mentions what works best for blood type B, and it sounds like common sense for everyone. I recommend this workout to anyone who wants an invigorating cardio/strength workout, whatever your blood type may be.",1393977600,6,810,4.711267605633803
8560194,5,B00B04KV0O,"I was hesitant to buy as I thought it may be older or revised.  Took a chance with Ellen as she never disappoints me. Just received DVD and did my first work out last night.  Repetitive to learn quickly and gently increase heart rate. I agree with the other user that it was longer than I expected, but overall an excellent low impact work out for Cardio, toning with Cardio and cool down stretch. Worked up a sweat and felt exhilarated after.
Liked it so much decided to try the other workouts in the Blood Type series...",1384387200,5,522,4.371134020618556
8560195,5,B00B04KV0O,"I have almost all of Ellen Barrett's video workouts, and this one is just as excellent as all the others.  I used it for the first time today, and it ran a bit longer than I expected.  Typically EB's videos are 45 minutes, but this one is 55 minutes.  The warm up was just that!  Very intense, but I loved every minute of it!  This is a great video for those who are serious about having a total workout.",1376352000,6,404,4.063291139240507
8560196,5,B00B04KV0O,I have all of Ellen Barrett's work out DVDs and I love all of them. This one is low impact so it's nice to have a change.,1371513600,,121,3.5185185185185186
