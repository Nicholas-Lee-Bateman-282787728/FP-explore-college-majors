2528281,5,B000EQ5Q68,This was a very informative documentary on Diana I always liked to see things about her she was a very interesting woman.,1189382400,,121,4.545454545454546
2528282,5,B000EQ5Q68,"I've adored Princess Diana from the very beginning of seeing her, and have always felt that there was so much more the public did not know - that being the real truth about her and her life in her own words.

This unparalleled documentary was created with great care, high ethics, and in a series of speech coaching sessions, Diana spills her heart, her frustrations, the betrayal, her true feelings - innocently, humbly and very honestly.

What is so important about this footage is that none of it was contrived for ulterior motives. It was simply revealed so humanity can finally know the real truth about Diana, and how she felt about her life, from her own mouth.

If you only buy ONE piece of information about Diana - THIS is the one to get. I have many, many books that I've been collecting since Prince's William and Harry were just small boys. In this video, you actually see Diana at home, as a regular Mom.

The ending of the video brought tears to my eyes, as I watched a woman with the purest heart be remembered, finally, for being herself.

This is now my all time favorite documentary, I wish I could give it One Million Stars. If you liked Diana, you will treasure this DVD - it is priceless, and it shows the heart and truth of the matters that weighed on Diana's heart. I am positive it will touch your heart as it did mine, finally knowing the real truth as told by Diana at home in front of a home video camera. Her memory lives on and shines as bright as ever, as she deserves it to.",1178236800,38,1506,4.345195729537367
2528283,5,B000EQ5Q68,Have watched this over and over - will be included in all my memorabia on Princess Diana before and after her death.  What a beloved woman.,1169078400,13,139,4.346153846153846
2528284,5,B000EQ5Q68,I had seen this documentary when it came on tv and was interested in what Princess Diana was really like.  I would recommend this to any Diana fan.,1166659200,12,147,4.25
2528285,5,B000EQ5Q68,This program truely captures the real Diana at home and being herself.  I captures the honest and caring person that she was and the sadness in her life.  It is a shame we didn't have more time to learn from Diana.  Although she was a Royal she was just a human being at heart!,1155945600,14,277,4.092592592592593
2528286,5,B000EQ5Q68,"This DVD gives the best insight into the life and thoughts of Princess Diana.  Having read over 60 books and seen 20 tapes on Princess Diana, this is a delightful view into her real life in her own words.  It is a ""not to miss"" for fans of the late Princess!",1152316800,17,258,4.03921568627451
2528287,4,B000EQ5Q68,"After I started watching this program I remembered seeing/taping it on Dateline NBC back in November/December 2004.

If you have any hearing difficulty or anticipate that development you won't want to throw away any tape you may have made of this program because the DVD isn't captioned (at all) or subtitled beyond what NBC did during the original broadcast. Visually the quality is perfect with no flaws, nothing removed but the commercial breaks and intro or next week bits reducing 2 hours worth of broadcast time down to (the package says) 66 minutes but I think it's more like 70+. You won't get any extra bits of Mr. Settlen's tapes or see the NBC bits any better than you did the first time, some of that wasn't the best quality.

The extra feature is a bit, broadcast I don't know when, about the charity foundation started in Diana's name. The quality on it is equally good.",1148947200,29,884,4.660256410256411
2528288,4,B000EQ5Q68,"Here you get to see Lady Diana talking about many incredible topics, she talks about them not to make a statement or with any agenda in mind, its just her and Peter Settelen her voice coach, talking about very private matters about her life,just trying to know herself and the image she displayed to the outside in order for her to improve it. It is kind of an excersise to know her true self. This is her life Story in HER OWN WORDS, you can get an image of what was and wanst real in her life told by her, not by her friends or asistants or anyone else, its just her talking.  Im only sorry that this video doesnt contain the actual 20 tapes that were filmed, or at least more.",1148256000,11,679,4.143939393939394
2528289,5,B000EQ5Q68,"Caught in a crumbling marriage, Princess Diana sought out the help of a voice coach (Peter Settlen) to help her be more forceful in public appearances. Settlen turned on his home video camera, to capture Diana's natural speaking style -- but he got a lot more. As the camera rolled, Diana opened up about her life and all its frustrations ... from her childhood through to her troubled marriage and failed affairs. What you get is an astounding and unguarded portrait of a vulnerable and hurt woman trying to put her life back together. The princess has a lot of ans out there -- they have read books, viewed other films... but none of those present as touching a look at Diana as this feature length NBC News documentary. Great bonus feature, too, about the work Diana's foundation is doing to keep her legacy alive.",1141689600,46,817,4.641379310344828
8112967,4,B000EQ5Q68,"for a year in 1992-1993 an actor met with Diana to help her refine her speaking voice so she could more clearly present her messages for charities/causes in which she was involved. The actor recorded the sessions. After her death he wanted the tapes back because he felt the tapes were his property based upon his work. (?)

He eventually got them back and then sold them to NBC, he explained it was to cover the expenses of his lawyers. (?) Some of the contents of the tapes are shown which feature the Princess recounting her difficult childhood and then her difficult situations with her marriage. Occasional insight, at one point her sons come into the room and she...parents them verbally.

Additionally there are visual images and interviews.

Extras features data about her foundation",1506124800,,791,4.888059701492537
