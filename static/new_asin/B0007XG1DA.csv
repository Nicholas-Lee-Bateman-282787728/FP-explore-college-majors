8179951,3,B0007XG1DA,"I am a huge fan of the classics and that extends even to cartoons.

The Bazooka Classic Cartoons had some truly wonderful animations, but I was disappointed in that the cover led me to believe there would be some of the later Mighty Mouse and Woody Woodpecker versions included.  There was only one Mighty Mouse cartoon and it was one of the very earliest of Mighty Mouse as the character only vaguely resembled the one I knew.  Plus, the Mighty Mouse theme song was NOT included.  There were no Woody Woodpecker cartoons in this particular DVD.

If you want just classic cartoons this DVD was fine, but I do not think the cover should give the impression there were cartoons included that  actually were not.",1168041600,17,709,4.632
