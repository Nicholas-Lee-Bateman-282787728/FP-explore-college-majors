8380687,1,B002TVQ4EY,I like the story it was just a bad copy.  Half way through it skipped every other word or two. I returned it,1418428800,,108,3.6956521739130435
8380688,5,B002TVQ4EY,"I used this as a teaching tool for my 4K/Kindergarten religious ed class. This movie was easy enough for my students to understand the story of Joseph and the importance of the gift of his dreams from God. Although this movie is ""belief"" based, it is NOT religion based and I would recommend this cute interpretation to any family/children that believe in God.",1398556800,,360,4.73015873015873
8380689,2,B002TVQ4EY,"this is the story of joseph with a narrator and still picture shots, but my kids did still enjoy watching it.",1391040000,,109,4.238095238095238
8380690,5,B002TVQ4EY,"Great entertainment & learning at the same time. Teaches the story of Joseph & his coat of many colors. Have owned these Precious Moments movies for many years now, great for grandchildren , church classes - purchased these for my youngest set of grandchildren.",1376784000,,261,4.954545454545454
8380691,3,B002TVQ4EY,"My only dissapointment with this is they didn't animate the story like they did the other precious moment movies.  Otherwise super cute.  It is like watching a book on tv.  Not as entertaining.  If I wanted that I would read it to my kids myself.
But the Timmy movies are exactly that, animated and precious!  Highly reccomend the other ones!",1323561600,2,342,4.633333333333334
