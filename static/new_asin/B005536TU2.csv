8457336,3,B005536TU2,"This is a French film (Canel+ etc) based on the final days of Stalin. So although they are all supposed to be Russian they speak French and not with a Russian accent.  It centres around a young female doctor ( Marina Hands), who has remarkable healing powers in her hands. I am not sure if she is a faith healer or does Raki or something, we are just asked to accept this fact.

Her colleagues are either jealous or fancy her, and as you could be denounced at the drop of a hat, she lives in constant fear of what may happen

She is married and deeply in love, but they are unable to have a child, so they keep practicing with the vigour of newly weds, causing more envy from the neighbours. One day the secret police turn up at the hospital and take her away. She soon finds out the Comrade Stalin (Andre Dussollier) has got to hear about her healing skills, and wants a bit of treatment.

He is ill through a life of excess and being generally a bit on the mean side to put it mildly. So he has a stipulation that she is not allowed to tell a soul about their arrangement. This includes her family -especially her husband. After reflection Stalin decides that having her word might not be enough.

This is an interesting film, but far from an exciting one. There are moments of cruel clarity and heightened tension, most notably from Dussolliers performance of the monster Stalin.  Those moments though are not enough to sustain the momentum and I think Director Marc Dugain has missed a trick here. It probably could have benefitted from some editing too. However, it manages to capture the mood and sterility of the time really well. If you are interested in post WW 2 history then this will be of interest, if you are looking for some sort of fast paced, drama with some action, then you should give it a pass.",1310515200,,1815,4.386904761904762
