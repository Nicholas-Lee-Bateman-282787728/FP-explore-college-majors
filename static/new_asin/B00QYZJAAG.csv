6890986,5,B00QYZJAAG,"Couple years ago I listened to the writer, David Cunningham in an interview about his book where he offered much info that did not sink in as well as this documentary but got me interested about Klansville. This documentary is based partly on his book and mainly about their leader who ended up in jail for a year. American Experience as usual has done a superb job in putting the audio and the video of those times together. Fascinating videos of fifties and sixties but not as detailed as the book but yet informative enough. To really understand Klansville, the politics of Dems and others in the history of Klansville, one needs to refer to the book. Amazing history of US politics in sixties. Bravo.",1421193600,11,704,4.64
6890987,5,B00QYZJAAG,It is a documentary that everyone should see.  The blacks were treated as subhuman people.  As a white Vietnam combat vet I have fought along side of many men who I was proud to serve with and had many black friends then and to this day.  The men and women in the Klan should have been jailed and the punishment should have fit the crimes. I believed this then and I believe it now.,1492560000,2,382,4.135135135135135

6890997,3,B00QYZJAAG,"I learned about the Klan due to this book, it's times of strength and times of weakness, it's times on the rise, and it's times on the wane. When LBJ began to put his civil rights legislation into practice, people could eat in places previously closed to them and attend school regardless of their race. When the sky did not fall in, Klanspeople took a look at their leadership. The head honchos were
discovered with their hands in the till. Disillusioned, the membership withdrew their support, and burning cross incidents decreased sharply.  And on it goes, the Klan's existence dependent on cultural changes. It bears watching.",1465603200,3,630,4.943396226415095
6890998,4,B00QYZJAAG,"This is an interesting and informative documentary about the Ku Klux Klan. Based upon the book of the same name, this documentary discusses the historical underpinnings of the Ku Klux Klan  and its resurgence at different times in our nation's history and how it became a force with which to be reckoned in the then most progressive southern state in the 1960s, North Carolina. For a while,  it was such a force within the state that instead of being known as the Tar Heel State, North Carolina became known as Klansville, USA.

This documentary focuses on the rise of the leader of the North Carolina KKK, Bob Jones, and the reasons behind his ability to organize and galvanize so many. His rise to power would be short-lived, however, in the face of the intervention by the FBI, the civil rights movement,  and congressional hearings, all backed by then president of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson.

Narrated by Oliver Platt, this excellent documentary, which runs under an hour,  offers vintage film clips, as well as insightful commentary by various experts. They provide a reasoned and invaluable analysis on the rise and fall of the KKK and why, for a time, this group was able to get such a stranglehold of North Carolina. Those who enjoy historical documentaries will find this one most interesting.",1462838400,,1313,4.865470852017937

6891004,5,B00QYZJAAG,"Are we now in 2016 have come full circle? Has the ""conservatives"" emulated the Klan today by playing on the same old fears that were present during the times so wonderfully documented in Klanville U.S.A.?

Is the better question; is the technique of preying on peoples fear working this time? Faced with the choice of a Roosevelt like choice (Bernie Sanders) or a Hoover like choice of a Clinton, Trump or Cruz; will the American people vote fear, and institutionalized bigotry or will they finally vote their own best interest and for the best interest of the country? Hopefully, we as a people will vote with a loud voice that screams a chicken in every pot for all instead of a chicken for a very few Americans.

This DVD should be shown in every high school, but then again who would have time? We must after all constantly teach our children to pass a test so the school is not closed, the teachers are fired and pay raises are not lost.

Watch this documentary and learn about how your world works today and then think about why voting and how your vote matters and how it will effects the lives of you, your family, your neighbor and the alike. Of course, you could always continue to live under siege and let yourself believe that America can no longer afford to be great.",1457308800,3,1280,4.508620689655173

6891041,3,B00QYZJAAG,"As a member of the Souther Poverty Law Center, I found it disturbing.  I'm glad that I watched it, but it is quite disturbing that there are so many hate groups around.
There are too many people who actually hate me simply because I am Jewish.  The KKK doesn't even consider us white and a separate race.  Since ANYONE who wishes to convert to Judaism may do so, we are NOT a ""race"" at all.  We come from all over the planet are ALL colors. Once converted they are full Jews as though they were born into our religion.
But hate groups are filed with ignorant, low intelligent people.  They think that there is something wonderful about being born white.  They form some of the most ignorant uneducated people around and hate educated people because we prove that all people are superior to them.  My doctorate is in computer science. So they can double hate me.  Frankly, m'dear...",1444867200,,881,4.531645569620253

Robert Byrd who was a Senator in the Democratic Party up until he recently died-all of these are in the DNA of the Democratic Party.  Were this despicable resume that of the Republican Party, be assured the film maker would have made sure to highlight those insidious facts.

There will always be prejudice and hatred in this world but the viscious  racist agenda of the Klan tops almost all but the atrocities committed by the Nazis in WWII.

He had my number and he had that effect on others too,  He turned out to be another officer, of the police kind.  Still, he did us no harm of any kind.  I heard no complaints and, what is more, he did more work than others.  Nobody bothered or challenged  him because there was no reason to.  There were others in the same category.  In Mississippi which, because of its history, we looked upon as the very bottom of hell, the presence of spies and double agents, meant a more stealthy and dangerous set of circumstances.  Hoover, no friend of the Civil Rights Movement and the local police would offer no help so workers had to swallow their hearts and dig down into their roles.

NC is and always will be inextricably linked with the South and its distinctive culture, but the origin of the state and its resulting complexion are the antithesis of the other Southern states save for maybe TN.

I would have to take issue with a point it made about the Andy Griffith Show. While using it as an example of how North Carolinians ""accepted"" blacks as equals as long as they didn't say anything and that was their idea of equal rights, the show was a spin-off of the Danny Thomas Show produced by and in Hollywood, never stepping foot in NC. It would have been the Hollywood powers that decided that blacks were not to have a voice in the show and had nothing to do with NC state. That is an example of how propaganda works and how a documentary can twist facts to fit their narrative. Not that the KKK would need facts to be twisted against them, but that a wholesome (and very fictional) TV show could be used to negatively portray someone or something for someones political position.

Klan members were police officers, judges, mayors, governors, senators, teachers, doctors, etc. Back then, the Klan was a respectable organization for respectable people. They could not have achieved those numbers otherwise. The modern-day agenda may be changing and erasing our history, but they cannot erase common sense. The poor, of any race, have never maintained power, therefore, the Klan could never have consisted of only ""poor white folk"". Use your head. Why would the producers of this ""documentary"" try to change public perception of history by claiming the Klan was made up of a bunch of dumb hicks? This video is a disinformation campaign to block the Klan from rising in power again. I doubt they will, this is a different country now, but make no mistake about the extreme power they held in their heyday. Just like in the past, the more violent these black supremacist groups get, like Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the new Black Panthers, the more support the Klan will get.
