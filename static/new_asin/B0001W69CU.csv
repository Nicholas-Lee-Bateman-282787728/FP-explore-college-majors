(In case you actually remeber DinoRiders, the main characters are hardly shown in this.)",1260057600,,247,5.621621621621622
8016842,1,B0001W69CU,"As a long-time Dino-Riders fan, this is painful for me to say. I have always loved this short-lived but always fun cartoon series for its well-defined characters, wicked cool armored dinosaurs, great action, and cheesy dialogue. But the ""Ice Age Adventure"" sucks. Period. Released about a year after the 13 episode tv show ended, this tape comes across as an afterthought thrown together in a last-ditch effort to sell some more toys. The animation is not that great: many dinosaurs and several characters have had their looks altered, and the character movements are awkward. But that would have been forgiveable if the story was good, and it's not.

 ""Ice Age Adventure"" depicts the Dino-Riders hopelessly caught off guard by the latest Rulon attack. They had been focusing on testing a time travel device involving the S.T.E.P. crystal. To prevent Krulos from getting the reactivated S.T.E.P. and returning to the future, Astra and the commandos activate the time machine but accidentally go to the Ice Age. The bulk of the episode focuses on the commandos' attempt to help some friendly cavemen in their war against some aggressive cavemen. Various Ice Age creatures are pointed out and dwelt upon in order to advertise their action figures; in no time flat these new animals are armored and ready to return to Prehistoric Earth to kick Rulon butt. Also going back is one of the good cavemen (who speaks relatively good English) and the evil caveman leader, who heads off to join the Rulons.

 None of the main characters from the cartoon series have important roles in this episode: not Questar, the hero and de facto main character, not Serena, Gunner, Yungstar, or Turret (I don't think the last two even had any dialogue), and not Krulos or any of the Rulons. And instead of showing the main conflict of the series, this episode focuses on some cavemen war we don't care about and unmemorable new characters. And the way the cavemen were fluent in English was really lame, I'm sorry.

 Dino-Riders had it's flaws as a cartoon, but it deserved a better ending than this laughable endeavor. In fact, it did have a better ending: ""Battle for the Brontosaurus"" and ""One to Lead Us,"" a two-parter featuring every important character and a surprisingly epic battle over the largest animal on the planet. Since the series apparently had to end, it should have left well-enough alone and ended with that slam-dunk finale, not this sloppy and cringe-worthy adventure.",1091577600,10,2466,4.944444444444445
