3881591,4,B0029WLJHA,"This is by no means a 4-star movie, but for whatever the reason I just like it! I don't know if it's the character acting, the over the top violence, the predictable story... whatever it is I'll put this on every few months and just enjoy it.",1336003200,,242,4.170212765957447
3881592,4,B0029WLJHA,"This movie has it all.  Indifferent direction, cheesy script, lackluster locations, undistinguished acting, but...I had a great time watching it and I don't know why (and I don't care to try to explain why).  This was the male version of my wife's idiotic rom-coms--she knows they're trash but loves them anyway.  Well, I knew this movie was crapola but I couldn't bring myself to turn it off: a most unusual and inexplicable phenomenon.",1300665600,3,437,4.958904109589041
3881593,5,B0029WLJHA,"I was pleasantly surprised after viewing this gem. After a slow start with a lot of driving and seemingly pointless discussions, the films quickly picks up the pace.
 While the language isn't as vile, it's a much bloodier film than, say, the Departed. It doesn't use the male-posturing crap that other movies seem to do to justify the carnage, either. Eric Roberts appears as if he's sleepwalking in the early scenes and I thought I was in for another straight-to-DVD snoozer.
 Wrong!
 While not portraying a ""deep"" character (after all, he is a hitman!), Roberts can handle the heavy ordnance with the best of them. (Refreshingly, he doesn't bust out crying in this one, folks.)
 The film has its plot holes and silliness and is far from perfect. None the less, I give it a 9.5 out of 10. I sincerely recommend. Very well made.",1267228800,6,828,4.689655172413793
3881594,4,B0029WLJHA,"Normally I would rate this kind of cheesy shoot-em-up lower (three star at the most) but this guy is such a work horse for the supporting roles - it was nice to see him adequately play the main guy with all of the screen time.

Eric Roberts plays the mob henchman who exacts some revenge after being set up for failure. There is some cheese, some overacting from the supporting cast, the well-known fake car scenes and plenty of hardware firing off, but in the end he makes for a decent watch from beginning to end. Ironside only has one scene in the beginning, so Davi and Eric are why one would watch this. Maybe for that car also. The picture quality looks good and the sound was fine so at least the budget existed this time to make it believable.

The supplement feature lasts 15 minutes and covers the usual interviews of cast and crew with the typical shots of the action logistics/production. The sneak peaks are the Michael Roesch fare that will someday make their way to DVD (Alone in the Dark II and Far Cry).

Overall, a decent watch for the Roberts fans and Jesse Johnson's best movie to date (I realize what little that can mean as my customers have despised his last few films), so I would say 3 1/2 for the movie, 1/2 for the extras and DVD quality; hope you enjoy this for what one would expect. As a side note, when Mr. Roberts came through this area to make Graves End a few years back (which is still not released in the US, grrr..) he was always an approachable guy that treated the locals nicely, even after 180+ films he still keeps it going.",1247356800,17,1565,4.352739726027397

8358404,4,B0029WLJHA,Great action film and Eric Roberts was good in this shoot em  up film.  Acting by everyone else was fair at best by everyone else.  If you are a Robertds fan  --check it out!!!!!!,1468454400,2,179,4.176470588235294
8358405,4,B0029WLJHA,"While Isaac Florentine has a death grip on the title of best direct-to-video action director, Jesse V. Johnson is definitely a runner-up. More restrained than Florentine, Johnson displays a particular aptitude for character development and storytelling, and in no instance more so than the vehicle crafted for star Eric Roberts. While not the action-packed extravaganza that I had been hoping for, it is an excellent crime-thriller that proves the cinematic experience is possible on a small budget.

The story: Double-crossed by the underworld syndicate employing him, a washed-up debt collector (Roberts,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>) strikes back by stealing a multimillion dollar take.

With a 113-minute runtime, The Butcher is a longer-than-average low budgeteer, but makes it worth it by building up its characters and allowing the actors to amply show their acting chops. This investment, in turn, is made worth it by the seriously good cast. Cult star Eric Roberts has the same natural charisma as David Carradine or Lance Henriksen, making any scene he appears in entertaining by default. Villain Robert Davi is in a similar league and for all the seems like he was gearing up for a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boardwalk-Empire/dp/B00TKFXFGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boardwalk Empire</a>&nbsp;audition. Also in the credits are the spectacular Irina Bjoerklund, Keith David, Geoffrey Lewis, Bokeem Woodbine, and Michael Ironside  occupying roles of varying sizes but all working towards my general impression of Wow, I forgot that movies like this could have good acting in them! The story they perform is a slow burner, sometimes too slow for my liking, but the atmosphere it creates along the way is excellent and its avoidance of clich is welcome.

The one bad thing about the story is that it comes at the expense of the action, which  despite the claims of the DVD case  is not evident from start to finish. Uncharacteristically for the directors movies, there is very little hand-to-hand content, which is disappointing considering the supporting casts inclusion of Dominquie Vandenberg, Dan Southworth, and Jerry Trimble (who gives a surprisingly wicked dramatic performance). Its focus is on gunplay, but youll have to wait until the second half to see anything substantial. There are three big shootouts, and while most of them lack overall creativity, each features at least a couple moments of cool absurdity. Roberts shoots through a brick wall with a shotgun to dispatch an enemy, and later grabs a decorative Browning machinegun to take on a club. The final shootout in a bar makes up for a lot with its hyper-violent choreography; its worth waiting for.

When I think of bad B-movies of the pre-2000s, I think of poorly-made shlock. When I think of bad B-movies of the 2000s and beyond, I imagine well-made but dramatically vapid shlock. Its nice to come across a movie that makes such a point of avoiding both pitfalls, and its good to know that there are indeed filmmakers out there who take this particular tier of filmmaking seriously. While I really wish there had been more action, The Butcher is worth at least the price of a rental.",1458864000,2,3336,5.529411764705882
8358406,4,B0029WLJHA,"I really enjoyed this movie, but then, I am an Eric Roberts fan, so I may be a bit prejudiced.  I bought the DVD because I know I will be watching it again.  It may be too violent for some people.",1436400000,,196,3.7560975609756095
8358407,4,B0029WLJHA,"Eric Roberts plays Merle Hench; he is a guy who used to be a boxer and has spent the last twenty years being an enforcer for a San Fernando mob outfit headed by Murdock. He has a bit of a gambling problem and is running out of usefulness to his erstwhile employer.

Then the new guy on Murdock's team sets him up and all bets are quite literally off. With nothing to lose he goes for broke and decides to take on all comers and get the heck out of it - with as much loot as he can carry and a girl - if possible.

Now this is a film that is about as subtle as a brick - the plot is so old it too is due for retirement, and some of the dialogue is cringe worthy. But where this scores really well is in the action. It is one hell of a shoot `em up and they really do go for broke on the hardware. Without the action this would be a bit of a fail, but with it we get a film that keeps you for the most part wanting to tag along for the ride. If you want subtle, plot and character development then look elsewhere if you want a good old fashioned guns going mental action flick then sit back and enjoy.",1428278400,,1099,3.8157894736842106
8358408,5,B0029WLJHA,"Very good movie.  If you're gonna make somebody retire, then let them go out with a bang!! I guess ex-hitman Merle Hench (Eric Roberts' character) was thinking about that quite literally.  I really enjoyed watching this.  Keith David and Robert David were pretty cool, too.  And eagle-eyed viewers will spot ""Huck"" from ""Scandal"" (Guillermo Diaz) in a small role.",1424304000,,363,5.101694915254237
