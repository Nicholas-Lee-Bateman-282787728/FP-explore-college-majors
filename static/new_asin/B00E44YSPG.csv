8600889,5,B00E44YSPG,"Dave Hunt (1926-2013) was a forthright Evangelical apologist who could never be accused of mincing words when it came to the Gospel. In this film, Hunt examines how ecumenism squares with God's Word. Special emphasis is given to the Vatican's efforts to gather together all of the world's religions under its leadership.

Scripture says there is only one way of salvation, by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ. Ecumenists claim there is truth in all religions and that everyone can merit Heaven by ""following the light they've been given"" and by being ""good."" The current pope has said EVEN ATHEISTS will merit Heaven if they are ""good"" and follow their consciences.

Why do you call me good? Jesus answered. No one is goodexcept God alone."" - Mark 10:18.

""Jesus answered, I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" - John 14:6.

It's not hard to imagine what the Apostle Paul would say about today's message of religious inclusiveness and plurality.

There aren't a lot of bells and whistles included with this production. It's mainly Hunt lecturing to a South African Christian fellowship in 1999 with a few photos and graphics mixed in. But Hunt's message is captivating and should be heard by every Evangelical. The False ""Unity"" of Ecumenism is available for instant streaming from Amazon.com. Unfortunately, it's not available via YouTube although you'll find a lot of other Dave Hunt and Berean Call material there.

Dave Hunt went home to be with the Lord in 2013 but his ministry, The Berean Call, continues under Tom McMahon.",1442102400,2,1589,4.888475836431227
