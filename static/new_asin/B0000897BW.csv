7980280,1,B0000897BW,"the creator of this product is a company called JUst Enough. But the product isn't enough to begin playing guitar. It won't get you even close to playing guitar. They advertise that it comes with a DVD, a CDROM, a book and an audio cd. The truth is that on the dvd, you are supposed to play things that you should learn on the cdrom. However, the CDROM does not contain the lesson required for you to play. And the book and the audio teaches you exactly the same lesson you got with the CDROM, instead of teaching new things! They say you have 50 lessons. That is a lie. Actual playing lessons are just a few, and very poor ones. It doenst even teach you to learn to tune your guitar, they just tell you to buy a digitar tuner for $20 bucks - and they count this one as ""a lesson"". They also count things like ""choosing your gear"" as a lesson.  In other words, it sucks and you'll feel cheated if you buy this thing.",1152835200,10,916,4.146067415730337
