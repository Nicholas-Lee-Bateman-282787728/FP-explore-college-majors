2385794,5,B000ADS66W,"This is a great incarnation of Scooby Doo and the Mystery, Inc. gang. Each episode is sharp, colorful, and well written.

But what makes this collection of episodes, as with the other dvd collections of the ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" series,  are the voices.

Grey Delisle, Mindy Cohn, and Frank Welker sound amazingly similar to the original voices of Daphne, Velma, and Fred (respectively) in the ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" series. And of course, the inimitable voice of Casey Kasem recast as Shaggy round out this show, so that even though it's new, it seems familar.

Why this casting choice wasn't made for some of the newer feature length Scooby movies like ""Scooby and The Witch's Ghost,"" I'll never understand.",1161043200,3,716,4.941666666666666
2385795,5,B000ADS66W,"In this fun and mysterious volume, Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Inc. gang go to Italy, Scotland, Greece, and France to solve four different and original enigmatic mysteries! Like all of the previous ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" episodes, they are harder to solve cases, than most of the ones featured in the old Scooby-Doo television series. I enjoyed watching this DVD because it's clearly for all ages, literally. These episodes are not meant to be JUST for kids, because I would say that about 90% of the adults with the right mind also have fun trying to solve the mysteries. These episodes, in particular, are four of the best ones picked from the entire show. Scooby-Doo mysteries are also funny, and these ones are no exception. With a lot of red-herrings on their way, the cases aren't easy to solve! They actually make you think - that's what makes them good.

Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, and Velma must unmask a ZOMBIE GLADIATOR in Italy, as well as an enormous DRAGON in Scotland, and a CENTAUR on their trip to Greece! Let's not forget the flying GARGOYLE statue that comes to life in France!

The episodes and the grade I give them are as follow:

- Pompeii & Circumstance: A-

- Large Dragon at Large: A+

- It's Greek to Scooby-Doo: A+

- Ready to Scare: A

To make my point, this volume of the ""What's New scooby-Doo?"" series is a must have for any Scooby-Doo fan. If you like solving puzzles, try to crack these cses with 87 minutes of mysrery, laughter, and fun! Scooby-Doo is the best, and these episodes rock!!!",1151107200,5,1531,4.648148148148148
