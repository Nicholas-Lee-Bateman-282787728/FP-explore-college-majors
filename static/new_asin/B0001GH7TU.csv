8012332,5,B0001GH7TU,"This movie is bad enough to get a 5 star rating. In ancient Egypt a female dies for the devil god Aman and is mummified. I doubt if the writer could even spell Egypt. Aman or Amon, or Amon-Re was the ram-headed god that never appeared in the movie. This god has nothing to do with evil. Set was perhaps their devil god. The mummification process involved a little more than wrapping someone in bandages. The dialouge was as bad as the acting. Our female mummy adapted very well to modern times, knowing how to give topless lap dances. I also couldn't tell if they were in California or Egypt. It is worth a peek for those who like bad movies, although I will warn you this is a Razor product. This is the fourth movie of theirs I have attempted to watch. The first one wouldn't load and two of the movies skipped, like the DVD was defective. The DVDs were opened from new cases and the problem persisted even after I cleaned the disc. Yes, all their movies are super VHS style and cheaply produced. But if they are equally cheaply manufactured, we can't watch them. I would recommend viewing as a rental only. Buyer Beware.

F-bomb, sex, nudity.",1315353600,,1145,4.42654028436019
8012333,1,B0001GH7TU,"I bought this expecting some fun little low budget mummy movie.  What I got was...almost beyond belief.  The acting is like - remember when you were in high school, and the teacher made someone read aloud from the book to the class?  That's the way most of the dialog in this movie is spoken.  I kid you not.  I expect that when I buy a movie, the actors will have some level of experience, maybe they even attended a class or something.  I don't pay money for a movie to see people standing in front of a camera and reciting lines for the first time in their life.

As far as the story, some ancient Egyptian girl kills herself in order to gain immortality, then in the present day some people  - you thought I was going to say ""dig her up"" or ""break into her tomb"", didn't you?  Nope, they find her fiberboard coffin laying out on the ground.  They open it up and someone off-camera tosses black plastic scorpions at them.

Okay, next scene - we meet our characters.  The girls spend some time sitting in their Toyota Rav 4 discussing how sleazy they are.  Then they drive to some apartment and meet a couple of guys.  This scene has to be one of the more embarrassing things ever caught on film.  Or video, I should say.  After a few beers and some fully-clothed ""sex"", they go to class.  Now, you might be expecting a classroom?  Nope, how about 6 people sitting at a folding table?  Their ""professor"" tells them about some Egyptian stuff, the students make Beavis and Butthead style comments.  Then the professor opens the ancient Egyptian coffin and the evil is unleashed.  Well, some smoke is blown into the room.  We're treated to oodles of truly awful acting.

Yeah, mummy appears every now and then and does a strip-tease, causing the guys to become hypnotized, then she kills them.  It goes on and on.  Did I mention recently that all the acting is like high school kids reading aloud for the class?

Overall, ordering this ""movie"" from Amazon, and then getting this...it's like ordering a novel and getting a ninth grader's English homework instead.  I love low budget trash, but this is just some student film project that somehow, unbelievably, managed to get distribution.",1222128000,5,2187,4.5552699228791775
8012334,2,B0001GH7TU,"This is the worst movie I have ever bought used. The only good thing about it was the two main girls, Heather Ashley and Jill Moore. The Mummy was a disaster and a joke. Obviously they spent more money paying for the talent eye candy than the costume and blood effects. The mummy when shown in costume (dead or undead) is about 5 inches shorter and 5 inches rounder than the girl who plays the mummy when she is in body form. The acting of the female mummy could best be described as going from bad to worse but her great sex appeal while dancing takes your mind off the fact that the costume is laughable. The two male leads were boring and I had to fast forward every unbearable scene they were in. The story line reminded me of another movie I have seen. Ancient Scream of the Mummy. There is no nudity and that was a disapointment although you cant take your eyes off of Lisa (Heather Ashley) and her amazing eyes (as well as her other assets). There is a lot of comic parts in this that I don't think Heather ashley intended to do. She peels out in her jeep, and she takes about 14 hits of what looks like acid while sitting in her Jeep talking to Jill Moore. Maybe that is what happened to this pathetic attempt at a horror movie. Speaking of comedy,There is one comical fighting scene involving the egyptian men and the ground eating them alive. Overall I'm glad I found this used and didn't pay much.",1077580800,,1408,4.296992481203008
