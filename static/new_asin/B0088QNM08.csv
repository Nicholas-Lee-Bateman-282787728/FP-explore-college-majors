Back then it was Heidelberg in the keg bottle, olympia, and blitz (I am from Portland, Or.). I am now 63 y/o and my palate has improved over the years. This DVD was full of information and a lot of fun. I consider myself an enthusiastic advocate for women brewers. At this time I don't have a favorite, however I am on a quest to taste at least 1000 different beers before I die....better get sippin'!",1339459200,,535,4.153846153846154
