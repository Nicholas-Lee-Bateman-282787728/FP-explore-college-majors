3146991,1,B0015QWZ7O,"About the time season one came out I was very keen to get all the WKRP in Cincinnati, it was listed number one thing to get. I don't know what it is (I think it has something to do with music royalties, that is the big hold up) I watched season one and found it great entertainment, it is the great dialog (strange humor) and only the dialog that turns me on with WKRP in Cincinnati, absolutely nothing to do with music.

But as time has dragged on, I am now at the stage I don't give a hoot anymore on series two(plus), my five stars has gone down to one. I have spent money on other DVD TV series and it is getting beyond the joke, if I get a Email to say the other WKRP in Cincinnati series are available, I might rethink if I want to spend even more money, in the mean time I am going to move on and get a life (without WKRP).",1272326400,3,830,3.911242603550296
3146992,5,B0015QWZ7O,I have been waiting a LONG time for the 2nd season to be released!!  I am hoping this long wait is because the producers are trying to get the original songs onto the DVD.  Would that be cool!  Now I admit it takes some getting used to the generic songs on the 1st season DVD and some cuts here and there... it is still a funny show and I got some good laughs.

I am almost willing to purchase a bootleg in order to watch every episode of WKRP.  Please don't make me do it!  At least WGN shows it on Sunday night and I applaud them for it.  Still, I want to have every episode of WKRP on dvd. Release them NOW!  Thank you.",1235433600,16,414,4.037037037037037
3146994,5,B0015QWZ7O,"Please, please, please release the rest of the WKRP seasons - this show deserves a long life on DVD in my library - come on, work it out and release this show!!!! :^)",1227139200,16,166,4.0606060606060606
3146995,5,B0015QWZ7O,"This is in no way realting to the sequel series that lasted two seasons in the early 90s and was criminally underrated by many. That was a funny show too, with some new cast members (we got visits from Venus and Johnny and Jennifer was in many of the episodes, but sadly never a visit from Andy travis or bailey Quarters). What I'm talking about are the original uncut and unaltered episodes, aired in the original network and early syndicated runs of the show withy the original music remaining. When the licensing ran out on much of the music used, many scenes had to be altered with generic soundalike songs, and in the process, a lot of the jokes fell flat as a lot of those songs were either used as comedic commentary on the scenes they were used in. When the first season was released, a lot of people (myself included) sent our DVDs back unopened. To me, WKRP without the music is like watching M*A*S*H with all the references to Korea removed! I've since found a DVD set of the entire series which was obviously taped back in the 80s and transferred to DVD. The quality for the most part is not perfect but very acceptable. I'm very curious as to what's intact musically when season two finally sees the light of day. The repeats on Sunday nights on WGN America actually have some of the original songs still in place. Wikipedia has a list of what was edited out and replaced, for those of you who are curious.

Love the sahow...in its original form...and even The New WKRP (1991-1993) had many funny moments too. I rolled videotape on those shows as well, with the original music that aired on that show. Not holding my breath, but the shows still make me laugh out looud some 30 years later.",1220918400,12,1702,4.472668810289389

3147015,5,B0015QWZ7O,"There is a very noticeable disclaimer on the back of the box about WKRP in Cincinnatis music right issues (an entire essay could be written on the topic). I guess the question boils down to are you willing to accept some musical changes to get this slapstick funny comedy series out on DVD or not? This is probably the best that WKRP fans are going to get barring major change of heart in the future.

In Season Two, character aspects are a lot more defined (see Herbs over the top suits, for example.) The show really got on a slapstick comedic role with these over the top larger than life figures like Johnny Fever, Herb Tarleck, Les Nessman, Mr. Carlson. Andy and Bailey play the straight man, but even they have depth to fit in with the more screwball characters.

We also see something of an evolution in the material thats covered as serious topics such as abortion rear their head. Although of course being that its WKRP in Cincinnati, it is done in a lighter way. When a show like WKRP goes serious, it stands out in a way where it wouldnt if the show was Law and Order SVU for example.

3147023,1,B0015QWZ7O,"Despite the TREMONDOUS hype from Shout! Factory about the successful Herculean efforts to get the music rights for the show, the S2 DVD set acknowledges that they fell short.  Further, I have yet to see ANY specific statements from this company regarding either the percentage of original music or even which episodes (if any) contain all the original music. This went as far as Shout! making a general statement when I raised these issues in a tweet.

I have watched the first two discs in the S2 set and have not noticed any difference regarding the success rate in getting original music compared to the highly criticized non-Shout! S1 set and have noticed (and am ""man"" enough to admit an inability to think of specific cases) the same instances as in the S1 set in which DJs Dr. Johnny Fever and Venus Flytrap announce a song by an artist only to have the same type of generic music in the S1 set begin to play.  Both the TREMONDOUS hype and the past glory days of Shout! led me to expect better.

A related point is a confident prediction that the Shout! Machine will result in people (perhaps with an undisclosed horse in the race) writing hostile and inaccurate responses to this review. I would ask that these same individuals please provide concrete statistics and examples to support their original music claims.",1450569600,4,1323,4.714285714285714

3147048,5,B0015QWZ7O,This is a hoot of a series - just watched a couple of episodes last night - I think they may have included the original music in the 2nd season release as the publishing house seems to be different then the first. Have to caution - didn't really pay attention to the two episodes music - focused more on the giggle of the story lines etc ... I'll update accordingly if I find they've messed with the music in later episodes ... Didn't spring for the complete collection as I'm budget pressed at the moment & figure the rest of the season's should be released since there's a complete season release & it's just a matter of packaging ...,1430956800,,636,4.352941176470588

3147060,4,B0015QWZ7O,"I know it states at the end of each episode Filmed in Hollywood Before A Live Studio Audience - - that may be true but when you hear all that loud laughter practically after every line or gesture an actor makes, it's hard to believe that an actual audience is making all that noise, especially considering episode 3 takes place outdoors on a baseball field

I was never a real follower of this show when it first aired, but was intrigued by the DISCLAIMER on the back of the cover. It States:

WKRP In Cincinnatti has a complicated history of music rights restrictions. To make this the most comprehensive DVD release possible, we have done our best to include every scene uncut and to license as much original music as possible.

WHAT A JOKE!!!!! Sure you get to hear the opening and closing Theme Songs, but What Music Is There in the rest of the episodes ??? - 2 or 3 seconds of a song clip ....REALLY, too quick to even recognize it sometimes.

In fact, the battle over music rights has delayed the release of a number of classic TV shows of the past. Wonder Years was finally released this year, with most of the music intact, about 20 - 30 second clips of 3 or 4 songs per episode, but then it costs around $250 for 6 seasons. And Happy Days season 5 was released last year with all the original music replaced with generic music, yet the cost was still over $30. This year Happy Days season 6 was released and had 2 20 second clips of original music, ""Blueberry Hill""  by Fats Domino and ""The Twist"" by Chubby Checker, still around the $30 mark. But if you add the total music clips of WKRP for this season, it doesn't even add up to 3 minutes !, and some clips are barely 1 second long, eg Little Richard, and the audio is so low, you can barely hear it. THIS IS INSANE !!!!!, you can get compilations of practically every decade of 30 original songs or more by the original artists at Walmart for $5 each.

On the bright side though, you get to see Loni Anderson, looking her best. And Howard Hesseman is fun to watch as Dr. Johnny Fever. And the other cast members are enjoyable as well. And the storylines are usually interesting. So if you are a fan of this show, then by all means, get it, but not for the music. But I sure wish I could have turned off that very annoying laugh track, it is a real distraction.",1426723200,2,2323,4.292237442922374
3147061,5,B0015QWZ7O,I would watch this show and can't wait to hear what music Dr. Johnny Fever would play and watch a fine cast of actors. Each episodes get better. I Highly recommend this T.V.Show!,1426550400,,178,4.424242424242424
3147062,5,B0015QWZ7O,"Shout! Factory has done a great job delivering the WKRP Complete Series in October 2014, and this stand-alone version of Season 2 should match its quality.  Much of the original music has been restored and I agree with the reviewers that say that the Shout! versions are probably the best quality copies of WKRP that we are likely to see.  Recommended.

Still, I want to have every episode of WKRP on dvd. Release them NOW!  Thank you.",1235433600,16,414,4.037037037037037

3381492,5,B0015QWZ7O,"This is in no way realting to the sequel series that lasted two seasons in the early 90s and was criminally underrated by many. That was a funny show too, with some new cast members (we got visits from Venus and Johnny and Jennifer was in many of the episodes, but sadly never a visit from Andy travis or bailey Quarters). What I'm talking about are the original uncut and unaltered episodes, aired in the original network and early syndicated runs of the show withy the original music remaining. When the licensing ran out on much of the music used, many scenes had to be altered with generic soundalike songs, and in the process, a lot of the jokes fell flat as a lot of those songs were either used as comedic commentary on the scenes they were used in. When the first season was released, a lot of people (myself included) sent our DVDs back unopened. To me, WKRP without the music is like watching M*A*S*H with all the references to Korea removed! I've since found a DVD set of the entire series which was obviously taped back in the 80s and transferred to DVD. The quality for the most part is not perfect but very acceptable. I'm very curious as to what's intact musically when season two finally sees the light of day. The repeats on Sunday nights on WGN America actually have some of the original songs still in place. Wikipedia has a list of what was edited out and replaced, for those of you who are curious.

Love the sahow...in its original form...and even The New WKRP (1991-1993) had many funny moments too. I rolled videotape on those shows as well, with the original music that aired on that show. Not holding my breath, but the shows still make me laugh out looud some 30 years later.",1220918400,12,1702,4.472668810289389

3381512,5,B0015QWZ7O,"There is a very noticeable disclaimer on the back of the box about WKRP in Cincinnatis music right issues (an entire essay could be written on the topic). I guess the question boils down to are you willing to accept some musical changes to get this slapstick funny comedy series out on DVD or not? This is probably the best that WKRP fans are going to get barring major change of heart in the future.

In Season Two, character aspects are a lot more defined (see Herbs over the top suits, for example.) The show really got on a slapstick comedic role with these over the top larger than life figures like Johnny Fever, Herb Tarleck, Les Nessman, Mr. Carlson. Andy and Bailey play the straight man, but even they have depth to fit in with the more screwball characters.

We also see something of an evolution in the material thats covered as serious topics such as abortion rear their head. Although of course being that its WKRP in Cincinnati, it is done in a lighter way. When a show like WKRP goes serious, it stands out in a way where it wouldnt if the show was Law and Order SVU for example.

3381520,1,B0015QWZ7O,"Despite the TREMONDOUS hype from Shout! Factory about the successful Herculean efforts to get the music rights for the show, the S2 DVD set acknowledges that they fell short.  Further, I have yet to see ANY specific statements from this company regarding either the percentage of original music or even which episodes (if any) contain all the original music. This went as far as Shout! making a general statement when I raised these issues in a tweet.

I have watched the first two discs in the S2 set and have not noticed any difference regarding the success rate in getting original music compared to the highly criticized non-Shout! S1 set and have noticed (and am ""man"" enough to admit an inability to think of specific cases) the same instances as in the S1 set in which DJs Dr. Johnny Fever and Venus Flytrap announce a song by an artist only to have the same type of generic music in the S1 set begin to play.  Both the TREMONDOUS hype and the past glory days of Shout! led me to expect better.

A related point is a confident prediction that the Shout! Machine will result in people (perhaps with an undisclosed horse in the race) writing hostile and inaccurate responses to this review.

I'll update accordingly if I find they've messed with the music in later episodes ...

3381557,4,B0015QWZ7O,"I know it states at the end of each episode Filmed in Hollywood Before A Live Studio Audience - - that may be true but when you hear all that loud laughter practically after every line or gesture an actor makes, it's hard to believe that an actual audience is making all that noise, especially considering episode 3 takes place outdoors on a baseball field

I was never a real follower of this show when it first aired, but was intrigued by the DISCLAIMER on the back of the cover. It States:

WKRP In Cincinnatti has a complicated history of music rights restrictions. To make this the most comprehensive DVD release possible, we have done our best to include every scene uncut and to license as much original music as possible.

WHAT A JOKE!!!!! Sure you get to hear the opening and closing Theme Songs, but What Music Is There in the rest of the episodes ??? - 2 or 3 seconds of a song clip ....REALLY, too quick to even recognize it sometimes.

In fact, the battle over music rights has delayed the release of a number of classic TV shows of the past. Wonder Years was finally released this year, with most of the music intact, about 20 - 30 second clips of 3 or 4 songs per episode, but then it costs around $250 for 6 seasons. And Happy Days season 5 was released last year with all the original music replaced with generic music, yet the cost was still over $30. This year Happy Days season 6 was released and had 2 20 second clips of original music, ""Blueberry Hill""  by Fats Domino and ""The Twist"" by Chubby Checker, still around the $30 mark. But if you add the total music clips of WKRP for this season, it doesn't even add up to 3 minutes !, and some clips are barely 1 second long, eg Little Richard, and the audio is so low, you can barely hear it. THIS IS INSANE !!!!!, you can get compilations of practically every decade of 30 original songs or more by the original artists at Walmart for $5 each.

On the bright side though, you get to see Loni Anderson, looking her best. And Howard Hesseman is fun to watch as Dr. Johnny Fever. And the other cast members are enjoyable as well. And the storylines are usually interesting. So if you are a fan of this show, then by all means, get it, but not for the music. But I sure wish I could have turned off that very annoying laugh track, it is a real distraction.",1426723200,2,2323,4.292237442922374
