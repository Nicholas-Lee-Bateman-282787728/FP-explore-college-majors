This was less to my taste, although I can see the validity of it in showing a part of American civilization that I have never or only peripherally encountered. It is a sound film, with clean photography and sound. I would imagine those who experience this kind of life will respond well. I can only comment on the technical skills, which were excellent.",1463443200,,525,4.844444444444444

All the little clips and blurbs that flashed by you in America's heart and soul, are now highlighted in this 4 disc set. It takes quite awhile to watch this. It is very enjoyable.",1432339200,,265,4.659574468085107
8213945,5,B000UNYJNQ,"This is a collection, a series about the US, like an extended version of America's Heart and Soul. I found the description very confusing, the product details were misleading and the actual description was for an animal video, which is just wrong, but since it was on sale for $6 with shipping, I figured what the heck. So, after receiving my box set, let me clarify it for you, this is a documentary series. Each episode is about thirty minutes long. There are four discs, the first disc is 198 minutes long and has seven episodes, the second disc is 176 minutes and has five episodes, disc three is 198 minutes and has six episodes, and disc four has bonus features. Near as I can figure out there are no working subtitles, unlike the film. I live abroad and special ordered the full length film to use in class, it is always quite popular. I am very excited to have an extended series about the US that is beautifully filmed and diverse.",1332633600,8,940,4.47093023255814

It is without a doubt a sleeper, a wonderful film..
  I received my DVD's and opened the package with some apprehension, There was only 3 DVD's and I thought Oh boy, I am not going to receive much new knowledge or entertainment from this,
  I was Ohhh so wrong, This is a very well done probe into American Culture of today.
  It is not only entertaining it is done very well. I have found myself back watching it several times,
 It is packed with a through amount of great film making, detail and research and a outstanding detailed presentation of our America!!!
  I am very satisfied with this package and my friends who have borrowed it for viewing have felt the same,
 Great buy , entertaining and thought provoking.....Sure beats by far the trash on American paid for TV Channels offered........ It will stay in your family I can assure you and be enjoyed for years",1203033600,13,1027,4.5027027027027025
