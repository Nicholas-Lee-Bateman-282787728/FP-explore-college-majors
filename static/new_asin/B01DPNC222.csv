7721647,1,B01DPNC222,"My husband purchased this for me as a gift and it has been a HUGE disappointment. Don't waste your money.  Every single disc in the set pauses, skips, freezes or repeats on the very first play.  It's like someone is repackaging old, used discs and reselling them as brand new.  It is a complete ripoff.",1485043200,,302,4.454545454545454

8756632,5,B01DPNC222,"Lost was a great series, although it wasn't an original idea. The Lost Islands and The New People are a couple of examples of shows that came decades before Lost. The New People is one of those shows that Ive wanted to buy on disc for years, but its never been available, and its not available to watch on Amazon either. Peter Benchley's Amazon is another plane crash survivor shows that preceded Lost.

After buying the first two seasons of Lost, and liking it, I bought the rest of the series on disc. I laughed at the crazy Jack character and some of his silliness, but overall the series was very entertaining. The ending didn't live up to the hype. Some reviewers said that Everybody was at the church in the last episode. Not true. Mr. Echo, Libby, Lucia and a ton of other characters were not at the church. The church was mostly empty. I think the church represented Purgatory.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2210,5.164804469273743
