2633447,4,B000HC2LOE,"I got this as a Christmas present for a sister-in-law who is developmentally delayed and enjoys watching reruns on TV (before the days of home video and now DVD) - I received this in a very timely manner, and she was very excited to receive it, and has told me that she thoroughly enjoyed watching it (and my sister and her husband verify!).",1267228800,,341,4.428571428571429
2633448,5,B000HC2LOE,"I bought this DVD for my kids (ages 8 &10) because they kept seeing the Brady Bunch on the on-screen TV guide and wanted to see the show. I figured they should see the beginning of the series so as to really understand how the group came to be ""The Brady Bunch"". Well, they loved it! I am glad we bought this,  as it was fun for my husband and me to relive all that Brady fun! There is a lot of Carol and Mike hugging and kissing. I had not remembered all that lovin when I watched it as a kid. Those Brady kids acted like real kids: they fought and got angry, but resolved things in the end. I would recommend this DVD without hesitation. Of course you can't beat the Amazon price and the free shipping made this purchase a no brainer. Enjoy!",1261872000,8,743,4.089041095890411

8138185,5,B000HC2LOE,"Like so many others, I grew up with the Brady gang.  My kids now 7y and 8y are so much better on car rides when I actually use the dvd player. I was looking for something w/ short shows - not a movie- but not with the usual 'comedy' of today w/ smart talking kids and pranks.  Not only do the lessons learned by the Brady's ring true today, my kids are glued to each story! They laugh at the corny jokes and often can see the 'lesson' to be learned. Their gentle ( um, sometimes unrealistically perfect) parenting and the gang of kids that are respectful of adults is refreshing.  Lastly, just as a side note- I'd do anything to have an ""Alice"" in my home- she's like icing on that sweet, sugary Brady cake!!",1433203200,2,708,4.1911764705882355

8138192,5,B000HC2LOE,"It's the Brady Bunch! We love them! The classic American family that has  a life before the Wii, cell phones, internet and all the rest of the garbage that is in the world today. My kids are 2,4,6,and 7 and love the episodes. The local library said that they are the most popular dvd checked out. The new versions, they can't give away!!
These are great for a cold Wisconsin night when there is nothing on tv. Sit back and make some popcorn and laugh with your children. They will remember these times and you never ever get them back! Cheers!",1290643200,8,543,4.376237623762377
