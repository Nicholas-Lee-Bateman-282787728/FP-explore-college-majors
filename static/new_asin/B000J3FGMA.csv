2666683,5,B000J3FGMA,"Yes the Earth shook on that day! There is no doubt about it! This DVD is a new Manowar masterpiece and I have been a fan of Manowar for about 19 years now and with each release Manowar does it every time! The quality of the DVD is totally mind blowing. The picture and sound is superior and the production is totally astonishing! Just the quality itself does not mean anything without the proper content and I assure you this DVD has it all!

The live show is mind blowing. The total length is 7 hours, filmed in full HD quality with 27 cameras and the biggest suprise of this DVD is, it features all band members past and present on the same stage performing!!! This is a dream for many harcore Manowar fans like me. The DVD also includes the extended version of the Manowar Fan Convention which is totally cool.

If you are a Manowar fan the chances are you have already ordered this DVD, if you are a heavy metal fan this is a must have Metal masterpiece. if you are a poser well... Leave the hall!!!",1164585600,12,1003,4.273684210526316
2666684,5,B000J3FGMA,"Manowar finds the way to deliver the goods with the frills.

You may or may nit like the ""viking attitude"" but it works for these guys, and the music is awesome.

I have been a fan since ""Hail To England"" years ago when I got a cassette copy from a buddy of mine in high school

Manowar needs to tour teh states, last time I saw them was years ago at THE MACHINE in Ohio.

Manowar delivers and I cant wait for the new studio cd that has been in the works for over 3 years now....",1164326400,3,479,3.9072164948453607
2666685,5,B000J3FGMA,"When are these people going to put a full concert version of 'Carry On' on one of thier DVD's - I'm tired of waiting.
 And when are they coming to the United States? (Southern (Orange County) California).

8148906,5,B000J3FGMA,"Ten years ago, I traveled to Germany to witness this once-in-a-lifetime event. Seeing all eight past and present members of Manowar on stage together was well worth the long journey.

The DVD is the next best thing to being there in person. The show is spectacular, the Fanconvention is chaotic and personal, and all of the incredible Manowar fans are just who they always are - metal to the core.",1437523200,,397,4.671428571428572
8148907,5,B000J3FGMA,What more can you ask for? All current an original members playing on particular songs. An on Battle Hymns 3 drummers 3 guitarist 3 solos. It REALLY means Absolute Power... Best live DVD iv bought recently,1404864000,,205,4.722222222222222
8148908,5,B000J3FGMA,"Kick ass, high quality footage or a huge Manowar show, Manowar style. BIGGER, LOUDER! If you cant afford a trip to Europe to see a Manowar show, this is the closest you will get to it.",1395446400,,184,4.138888888888889
8148909,5,B000J3FGMA,"I wasn't expecting much, I'm not a music snob at all but I have heard a few MANOWAR albums that sounded like recordings of Gothic sounding Norse recordings done as background music...to ,,,well..Nothing!  This is simply a terrific DVD with great filming and sound and above all an amazing concert.  The shots of the animal like crowd singing along to the screaming lyrics (that I can't comprehend0 is quite a tribute to a band far more cartoonish than I had expected. They sing about METAL in just about every song...Mettttal.. HAHA
This is really FANTASTIC stuff. If you take it seriously well...go ahead...But if you put tongue firmly in cheek.  This is great",1379894400,,661,4.831858407079646
8148910,5,B000J3FGMA,This live DVD is one of the most epic moments in metal history. All of their previous band members on stage at one time rocking out. Sound quality is superb and camra angles are great.,1354838400,,184,4.285714285714286
8148911,5,B000J3FGMA,"I have bought this DVD for my husband. And to tell you the truth, it has worth every penny.
The sound and picture quality are perfect.
The performance of the bad, the audience, the stage, the ambience,.. everything is awesome.
We have said that this was hell of a show. We wished we could have been there...",1292889600,,307,4.4035087719298245
8148912,5,B000J3FGMA,"When I thought that Manowar reached their top, and started to repeat, they remade themselves live, in this awesome presentation. A must to a fan, a must to anyone in heavy metal willing to have a piece of live history in his hands. 3 awesome guitars. 3 spectacular drums. One super chorus. One orchestra. 2 full hours on one disc, of full music.

Heavy metal is the law, and as a chorolarium this DVD.

HAIL AND KILL",1186963200,,416,4.3896103896103895
8148913,5,B000J3FGMA,"Of course when someone write about a DVD is for some secoNdary good or bad reaction... this is not the exception, but. Of my long list of rock power or heavy music DVD, this became the pearl.

Excelent Video quality (just comparable as Maiden death on the road)
Excelent 5.1 , not comparable to anything
Excelent play list

Is awesome how 1 bass?, 1 guitar, 1 drum and the big voice make so loud sound.

The extras are really great , too much material to see. This is a REAL DVD born to be a DVD.... not a recorded concert with a couple of interviews.
Not a fan of Manowar till this (1 week ago)

buy THIS",1184284800,,605,4.145299145299146

8148915,5,B000J3FGMA,"Verdaderamente Todos aquelos que somos fans de Manowar, ya conocemos ampliamente su musica y sus temas, este album nos deja mas que satisfechos. La eleccion de los temas no olvida ningun clasico, con el plus indescriptible de haber reunido a todas las formaciones del grupo de todos los tiempos....killer!!!.  El final es apoteotico y es un verdadero regalo a los fans, la perfomance en sonido es muy buena.

Todo lo que queremos esta en este cd. para todo fan de manowar es un deber comprarlo, y para todo aquel que le guste el heavy metal, les digo Comprenlo ya!!.",1173398400,,566,4.707070707070707
