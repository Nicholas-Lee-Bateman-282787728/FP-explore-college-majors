8492104,1,B0063J9CZ6,"Another really bad DVD-R release. I believe this movie was transferred from a VHS tape in the PAL format to NTSC DVD-R. After about 10 minutes into this 120 minute movie you start to notice that the video and audio are not in sync, but that's just the start of this problem. As the movie progresses, it gets even worse. The sound gets up to about 3-4 seconds behind the video. You see someone talk, but hear their voice in another scene when some other person is talking. You see an explosion, but hear it in another scene. Add to that the pixels and ghosting in the video and you have a release that is frustrating to watch. Buy it only if you the patience to sit through almost 2 hours of this, or you never get headaches!",1401494400,,724,4.253623188405797
8492105,3,B0063J9CZ6,"I am a hardcore scifi buff and I like to brag that there isn't much I haven't done in the genre: StarKnight, Lorca and the Outlaws, Treasure Island in Outer Space, Jupiter Moon, Salvage 1- been there done that all so you could imagine my surprise when I happened upon Escape from Jupiter: a two hour feature film based upon a successful series of the same name that follows the adventures of the five children who escape, along with a handful of adults, from the crumbling, over-mined world of Io, one of Jupiter's moons.

Furthermore, and making for good movie material, their attempt to reach earth aboard an abandoned space station called KL-5 is met with a never-ending stream of disasters.  A little further research reveals that the show itself was an Australian children's science fiction drama which aired from April 1994 to July 1994 that ran a mere 13-episodes.

The film incarnation (being reviewed here) apparently condensed the 13-episodes into a 2-hour film that, unlike the series it's based on, got an international DVD release (in November of 2011) from a company called Worldwide Media Organization.

But before we move on to discuss the film itself, it turns out that little ol Escape from Jupiter was actually popular enough to warrant a novel in 1995 (by David Ogilvy) and a 13-episode follow up series in Australia called Return to Jupiter in 1997.  You have to admit, when viewing all of the attention this little series earned, dropping $12.95 on the item here is pretty much a no-brainer.  Unfortunately, things get shaky the moment you actually pick up the DVD case.

I don't know a whole lot about Worldwide Media Organization but computer printed cover art and stills that look like they were photographed from a VCR on pause will have even the most optimistic among us wondering if this wasn't made in somebody's basement.  But no worries, judging films by their cover art is a lot like judging a book by its cover right?

Unfortunately popping it into the player does little to ease skeptical minds.  The 1:33:1 aspect ratio does indeed confirm suspicions that this was transferred from a grainy VHS copy to digital.  As a result color bleeding, a small viewing area, and choppy tracking during camera movements are all a given.  The audio survived the transfer slightly better in terms of volume and clarity but after a few moments into the film, the mouth movements and dialog have absolutely nothing to do with one another.  Sadly this trend carries right on through to the film's conclusion.

Amazingly, the show foregoes use of models for its special effects in favor of crude computer generated imagery.  As you probably already realize, early CGI was pretty rough, nothing like the seamless transitions of today.  To compare it to something, it's rather like 1987-88's Captain Power and the Soldiers of Fortune.  If that means nothing to you, think very early video game cut scenes.

In case you haven't been following along, it's pretty safe to say that the audio/video quality of this piece is definitely a lot closer to what one would expect coming out of the early 1970s rather than a show produced in the mid-90s and put on DVD in 2011 but again, oftentimes the experience of decent science fiction television transcends the limitations of the AV (think Blakes 7, Star Trek: The Original Series or Space: 1999).  In that line of thinking, does Escape from Jupiter deliver?

Well sort of- I've heard it said that the plot may have been loosely based on the classic Robert A. Heinlein young adult novel ""Farmer in the Sky,"" and indeed there are more than a few passing similarities.  The cast was well selected, with some pretty memorable kid actors bringing the characters to life (as the adults here are presented as either incompetent or malicious).

The main focal point is a character named Michael Faraday, a boy in his teens who has lived in space his entire life. Having never been to Earth, he resides with his father on the moon Io. Despite being a mining colony habituated predominantly by adults, few have their families with them. Michael's best friend is Kingston, the son of the medical officer of the colony. In addition to this duo are Jarrod and Anna, both children of a fellow miner Carl. Jarrod and Michael always compete with each other, Jarrod being the brawn and Michael being the brains. Michael's father is the local space tug pilot who ferries passengers and equipment to and from the moon to the orbiting space craft.

The action heats up when mining too close to the moon's core causes a series of quakes and volcanic eruptions.  The surviving crew and their families flee to the orbiting space station KL-5 and plot a course in the antiquated vessel to reach earth.

From there the film should really be called A Series of Unfortunate Events as the plot shifts from narrowly avoiding disaster on the moon to narrowly avoiding disaster in space time and time again.  And again.
From nearly running out of air, to attempting to traverse the asteroid belt, to a rogue defense satellite mistaking them for enemy craft and attacking with deadly laser fire, which sends them off course towards the sun, KL-5 is a certainly a craft of struggle after struggle.

In the end, the experience isn't quite painful but it really can't be called enjoyable either.  The story is passable, albeit close-call ridden, and could probably be made to work with modern AV, digital transfer techniques and CG that isn't so primitive.  As it stands however, maybe worth a view on the net if, like me, you've ran out of new space science fiction series to discover.",1361577600,,5608,4.806451612903226
