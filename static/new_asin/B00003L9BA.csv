1331325,1,B00003L9BA,"I wish I had read some of the other reviews before purchasing.  My 4-1/2 year old son and 2-1/2 year old daughter (who both love Thomas and have  watched multiple Thomas videos) can't even watch this.  My daughter was  crying and son had his hands over his ears so he couldn't hear - we can  only watch one story and the song from this video.  Needless to say, we  were disappointed.  My children don't watch TV and not many videos so  partly I'd say they're not de-sensitized to what's out there - but the  bottom line is this is NOT like the other Thomas videos we've seen and I'd  recommend trying to view it first before buying if your children are  sensitive.",965088000,3,664,4.352459016393443
1331326,5,B00003L9BA,"After three attempts, Alec Baldwin, the narrator has put some life into the characters that was missing from his earlier efforts on ""Cranky Bugs"" and ""Races and Rescues."" As the editorial review  suggests, this video is scarier and more suspenseful than earlier Thomas  stories, so I don't consider it suitable for children under 5. ""Spills  and Chills"" introduces a new character, Boulder, a big round rock with  a pouty face that is probably the most clever Thomas character yet.  ""Spills and Chills and Other Thomas Thrills"" would be a fine  addition to your Thomas video library.",951696000,23,583,5.020833333333333

1331386,5,B00003L9BA,"I'm a 24 year old Thomas buff and I have watched Thomas since the early '90s. I have never found any Thomas adventure boring and I love ALL of the stories on the DVD just lots of fun and yes I still have the VHS copy when it came out in 2000. Fun adventures with Thomas, Rusty, Henry, Toby and all of the Island friends. You get to meet new characters like Bertram (a small Narrow Gauge Engine), Thumper, Tiger Moth (a biplane), Old Bailey the fogman, among others. It was also fun seeing Rusty get chased by a giant boulder (does that sound like some familiar Hollywood film?), Toby befriend a 'ghost' that turns out to be a little Narrow Gauge engine that looks similar to Duke, Henry find out that a 'ghost' inside a station is actually a friendly fogman named Old Bailey, and see Sir Topham Hatt and his family go on a wild and crazy vacation. You will not be disappointed! I know I'm not and I never will be. Two thumbs up!",1444435200,,928,4.248587570621469
1331387,2,B00003L9BA,"This is the one Thomas & Friends video that we won't let our son watch anymore. It's very scary at points and it tended to stick in his imagination and memory. The runaway boulder was especially scary for him.

After viewing it,  we bought a round wooden ball at a craft store and painted it light gray with a flat paint.  We drew Boulder's face on it in pencil.  We had a plastic mountain with a flat top (from an unrelated set of toys), and boulder sits on top of it on the train table at our house.",1389312000,,397,4.297297297297297

1331469,1,B00003L9BA,"I thought that Thomas and friends was a safe tv show for my son. However, I noticed that he has developed a penchant for crashing. When I watched several shows and paid closer attention to the lyrics of the song ""Accidents Happen,""  I noticed that in about 90% of the shows, someone is crashing.  At first, I was leary but thought maybe that's fulfilling the aggressive side of boys and began to monitor him more closely. From that day to this I've noticed aggressive behavior and him crashing all his toys and telling me stories of how he hopes the el train skips the track a crashes with passengers in it.  I'm appalled and though this may not be the typical result of watching Thomas, why do so many episodes promote crashing? I am now conducting empathy training with him. And no more Thomas videos. We know make up empathetic stories while playing with his trains.",1293753600,,869,4.5576923076923075
1331470,5,B00003L9BA,"My 3 year old loves Thomas. This video is a particular favorite because it is a bit suspenseful. When our VHS player ate the tape my little guy was so upset I bought the DVD. Now peace has been restored in our house

1331471,1,B00003L9BA,"My husband and I have relied on Thomas the Train videos to be ""safe"" for toddlers.  So we were astonished at this one.  WHY did the writers think that making a spooky video would be beneficial to their young audience!?!  Halfway through the third story we stopped it.  Our 3 1/2 year old son said it was scary.  Needless to say, this one ended up in the trash.  Next time we will not assume that Thomas is harmless.",1230595200,,415,4.256410256410256
1331472,5,B00003L9BA,"When we recieved this DVD as a gift I was a bit apprehensive, then I watched it.  My son's face lit up at the action and adventure that Thomas and friends provided.  He ask me all the time to watch ""boulder"" video.  Boulder is a character in the movie.  Now when he goes to bed I ask him to tell me a story, and he tells me about boulder.  I nearly cried at how cute he was telling me about the boulder on a cold night on the island of sodor.  I recommend this for all parents of Thomas lovers.",1097020800,6,494,3.89
1331473,1,B00003L9BA,"Okay so I guess the stories one this tape are supposed to be scary like a ghost engine and a unexpected visit to the scrap yard but I think they should just stick to the regular Thomas stories because how could Thomas possibly be scary. Actually, this one was so terrible that I even feel bad giving it one star. The Stories are:

Toby's Dicovery  C:

This story starts out all happy when Toby and Sir Topham Hatt are trying to find a lost castle. They also find a mine near the castle and Sir Topham Hatt decides to put the mine back in business. But at night the mine looks very scary at night, at least to Toby it does. Soon enough Toby sees an engine that he thinks is a ghost.

Rusty and the Boulder  F:

Okay here are the highlights of the story, I boulder, with a mind of it's own starts rolling around the Island of Sodor, Yawn. This is probably the WORST THOMAS STORY OF ALL TIME!

Duncan Gets Spooked  B:

One of the better ones on this video. Duncan's driver and fireman play a trick on him while crossing the old iron bridge. Duncan soon thinks that he sees the ghost engine that fell of the bridge in an old legend.

Stepney Gets Lost  F:

Another awful story. Stepney gets lost while going home from a long day of pulling freight cars and, after taking an wrong turn, he finds himself in the scrap yard. His old enimies, Arry and Burt, take him to the incinerator to be turned in to scrap iron. But then Sir Topham Hatt saves Stepney and he is able to go home after all.

Haunted Henry  A:

The best one on this video. Edward tells Henry about the ghosts that come out at night one the old railway. Henry refuses to believe Edward, but when he travels on the old railway that same night, he sees something that might be a ghost.

Sir Topham Hatt's Holiday  C:

Sir Topham Hatt and his family go on a holiday. But Sir Topham Hatt encounters some problems and his holiday is ruined until Thomas helps him out.

Again, not a very good Thomas video and I wouldn't recommend it.",1096588800,4,1987,4.222811671087533
1331494,2,B00003L9BA,"This video does have some decent stories on it, like Duncan Gets Spooked, but there are also some of the worst episodes of Thomas & Friends on it too. Rusty and the Boulder for example has a boulder with a mind of its own chasing the little engines, ending up crashing into a shed and bursting into a fireball. The narration by Baldwin is ok, but it could be better.",1087862400,,366,4.242857142857143
1331495,5,B00003L9BA,This is probaly the 2nd or 3rd Alec Baldwin tape there was and I thought he did a okay job. It wasn't really that scary. My sister has been much more scared in Percy's Ghostly Trick or in Thomas Percy and the Dragon. I wouldn't not give this tape to anyone because it's not that scary. I think their now makiing Stepney the Blubell Engine from Austraila. And it the books Stepney's not even the Fat Controler's engine. And when he was first introduced in the tapes he wan't Sir Topam Hat's either. Just because their's a new narrator doesn't mean they should forget the old stuff. I thought Rusty and the Boulder was pretty good but I wish Thumper was used more often. He was in only one. This tape was good but it didn't stand out from the others.,1075334400,3,748,4.3120567375886525
1331496,5,B00003L9BA,"Lots of children think this video is scary. Well I think they need to understand the stories are just tall tales (That means the stories are made up). The stories are really cool to me. My favourite stores are probatly ""Duncan gets spooked"", ""Stepney gets lost"" & ""Rusty & the boulder"". I also like ""Haunted Henry"".
But, did you know that the engine who falls off the bridge in
""Duncan gets spooked"" was acctually played by Skarloey? Maybe children will like it when they are between 4 & 5 years.",1049760000,3,496,4.522222222222222
1331497,5,B00003L9BA,"A video that made my kids rejoice!! When my kids invited me to watch this video, I thought that it would be lame. But what I got was a very nice video. My favourite one was when stepney was almost scrapped. A good video and well done to Alec Baldwin for good narrating. But parents be warned...this is not a video for squimish kids. I thought that it was a bit extreme for littles but for oldens i would reccomened it!! It was the best even for me.",971136000,3,448,4.1022727272727275
1331498,3,B00003L9BA,"We bought this video for our 2 and a half year-old.  Well, shame on me, I should have previewed it before we popped it into the VCR.  She loves  Thomas and his friends, but the stories on this tape are pretty frightening  for such a young child.  I think we'll put this back into the closet until  she's 4 or 5.  The only part she really enjoyed was the cute little  song/video at the end of the tape.",965088000,4,401,4.051282051282051
