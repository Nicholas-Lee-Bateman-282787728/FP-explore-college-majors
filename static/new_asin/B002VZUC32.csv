8382666,5,B002VZUC32,"Good Eats is the only show I have ever purchased on DVD. I watch all of them as I cook dinner. The only thing I'd be able to complain about is that this set has the THIRD different cover scheme. There are no outtakes or an ""Ask Alton"" segments, which is too bad, but it does have what you bought it for: three Good Eats episodes. Which are always excellent and worth watching again and again.",1275004800,2,392,4.171052631578948
