On one hand, it does have some material that really isn't suitable for children. So parents should probably screen it first.

But on the other hand, it does neatly break the 70s into 10 chapters. Obviously, this dvd only has 1 1/2 hours to convey what happened in 10 years. So it can only cover so much.

But that said, it does offer us a nice quick glance. It mentions how the 70s were a reaction against not only the 50s, but the 60s as well. We get to see the fashions, and some important historical events.

It also allows us to see some of the shows and movies that were popular, as well as the rise and fall of Disco.

Interestingly, it shows the great things about Studio 54, but also the dark side in how certain powers played God.

While it offers some comical elements, it also has some really sad moments such as the death of Elvis.

Overall, it's a great package that gives a nice quick look at the decade. I do suggest it if you are looking for some 70s nostalgia. But I also agree with the reviewer who said that some of it is not fit for children.",1347148800,3,1098,4.1753554502369665
7998203,1,B0000C5054,"Even with the realization that I may be viewing my childhood through the rose-colored glasses of sentimental reminiscence, I can't believe that this DVD attempts to pass itself off as a well-rounded view of the seventies.  It seemed as though each year had its mention of the sexuality of the period, along with views of scantily clad women, a couple of takes on the Rocky Horror Picture Show, mentions of Sex Shows and Gonorrhea, and even some female streakers, which they saw fit to replay at a later time in the show... just when you thought you were past all the streakers, etc.  they would play the same footage again.  At the beginning, this movie was billed as one which would be suitable for adults and children... I don't know many people who would appreciate their children viewing streakers and discussions of gonorrhea and sex shows, etc.  No mention at all of the superb automobiles of the seventies, with their jacked-up rear ends and sqealing tires... the bicycles we all had with banana seats and tassels on the handlebars... the only TV shows mentioned were The Partridge Family, The Brady Bunch, All in the Family, and Saturday Night Live.  There was plenty of commentary by The Village People, and the actor who played Greg Brady.  Danny Bonaduce talked really quickly, with very little inflection, racing through the dubious points of interest.  I found this DVD to be a big disappointment.  People who were small children in the 70's are very unlikely to find any connection between the topics chosen for this film, and the actual lives they lived during that time...",1200009600,8,1588,4.833948339483395
7998204,5,B0000C5054,"If you experienced the 70s, whether as a child growing up with the Brady Bunch and the Partridge Family or as an adult thrust into polyester leisure suits and platform shoes, you will LOVE this entertaining DVD!  Danny Bonaduce was an excellent choice for narrator -- not only because we knew him in the 70s as ""Danny Partridge,"" but also because his humor and inflections were on the mark.

If you survived the 70s and haven't seen this yet, it is a MUST see!",1152921600,8,460,4.464285714285714
