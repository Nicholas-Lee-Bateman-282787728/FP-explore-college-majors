8341747,3,B001TK29UO,"This DVD could be played b4 a meeting starts; just enough time to get everyone seated, etc., b4 the Service begins.
It's not a high-tech professional product. Basically, simple piano music, playing c. 1/2hr. A scripture transposed on the front of each hymn. The words to the music is there (also), so could be sung by congregation participation.
It's not polished but it'll do
The first copy I received had a glitch but when reported Amazon replaced it 'auto' w/o request for replacement! They made an exception.",1511568000,,512,4.896551724137931
8341748,5,B001TK29UO,"I have had the pleasure of visiting Kodiak, AK, and I can tell you that viewing this DVD was the next best thing to being there. The scenery on this DVD is as inspiring as the music. I can watch it over and over again with out ever becoming tired of it. I have just ordered one for a dear friend who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. I know it will lift her spirits and be a real blessing to her. Thank you, Linda, for taking the time to put this wonderful DVD together!",1238457600,,480,4.010416666666667

The arrangements of these beautiful hymns took me back to a more reverent time in my life, and I enjoyed being there!  This is one that will stay on my list of wonderful music and beautiful pictures for a long time.  I can't wait to see and hear the next DVD from Ms. Kozak.",1235865600,,530,5.769230769230769
8341752,5,B001TK29UO,I live in Kodiak so the scenery on this DVD has special meaning to me. I never tier of the Islands beauty! For those who do live here I would only imagine that you will be awe struck by the grandeur of Alaska. If there was no devotional music along with the videos I would still feel the joy of Gods many gifts. But with the addition of music and verse my wife and I find an uplifting experience every time that we play and sing along with this DVD. This is a great addition to your video library. Great job Linda!,1235865600,3,514,4.049019607843137
8341753,5,B001TK29UO,"Ms. Kozak has masterfully captured the island's beauty, and together with the perfect selection of classic hymns and inspirational verses, she has woven them into a fluid tapestry that transcends time and generations. This DVD is perfect for anyone seeking encouragement for themselves, a friend, or a loved one; as an instrument of worship; or a souvenir of Alaska's Emerald Island. Have several on hand, as this is sure to be a blessing that you will want to share with others!",1235779200,,479,4.925925925925926
