4897798,3,B005VUTRGW,I had seen this movie on tv before I purchased it.  It appears to be a condensed version of the movie and not the entire thing. Very disappointed.,1355270400,,146,4.214285714285714
4897799,3,B005VUTRGW,"I bought this DVD because I had watched it on T.V. I tivo the movie which was on in 2 nights, but something happened to my cable box & I had to return it to the  cable people. I lost all of my movies, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was one of myminiseries that I lost.  When I found it Amazon I quickly purchased it, but was very disappointed with it, you cut almost half of the movie out. Scenes like when she went to the Kennedy compound for thefirst time, She sat with Mrs Kennedy, & then she called over Joe, thats not in there, another scene when she was having lunch with her daughter it wasn't there, Scenes with Onassis were cut out, I'm very disappointed with the DVD.Unless you can correctly copy a movie made for T V, then don't make one at all",1348963200,4,759,4.191780821917808
4897800,3,B005VUTRGW,"I first saw this movie when it originally aired on CBS back in 2000. I was very excited to find a a DVD copy  until I watched and found that many scenes had been cut from the original movie when it first aired. That being said, it s not the best movie ever made regarding Jackie and the Kennedy's but it s enjoyable nonetheless.",1346716800,,328,4.125
4897801,1,B005VUTRGW,"Bad acting, bad accents, real silly movie to me. In fact I diliked it so much I only watched half and turned it off.",1335916800,3,116,3.875
4897802,3,B005VUTRGW,"In order to tell Jackie's story the way it should have been told,I think it would have needed to be at least twice as long. I got the feeling we were being hurried over a lot of things and others were left out.  However, this is the first movie about the Kennedys that put forward the idea that Jack married Jackie pretty much because it was time he got married according to his father and she happened to be the society girl in his life at the time.  The undertones of why she was attracted to him lies, I think, in his resemblance to her father in manner and behavior.  Joanne Walley gives a rather boring, one dimensional performance.  She isn't tall enough or thin enough for the role and I don't think she really conveyed Jackie's soft voiced charm. That was always the first thing I noticed about Jackie Kennedy - that little girl almost breathless voice. Tim Matheson does not fit the role of JFK. He appears too old right from the first scenes. The hair isn't right and his performance is also one dimensional and boring. It's certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen about the Kennedys but it's not very good. Of course Tom Skerritt is wonderful as always but doesn't quite get the accent. Baker is embarassing as Rose. Not enough to do and didn't do much with what she was given.  I keep wondering when Amazon is going to offer the excellent 6 part series ""The Kennedys of Massachusetts"" on DVD. Now, THAT was a Kennedy movie.",1335398400,5,1440,4.4393939393939394
4897803,5,B005VUTRGW,I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE A LOT. I AM INTO HISTORICAL MOVIES VERY MUCH. I ADMIRE JACKIE IN WHAT SHE HAD TO GO THROUGH LIFE THAT WASN'T ALWAYS FAIR TO HER.,1334620800,,154,4.0
4897804,3,B005VUTRGW,"Dear Diary,

I just recieved the DVD, ""Jackie Kennedy Bouvier Onassis"" in the mail yesterday,a TV miniseries that aired on CBS in the Fall of 2000...unfortunately I missed it and I have been looking forward to it being released on DVD to complete my collection of all things ""Kennedy"" (I am still waiting for the excellent ""A Woman Named Jackie"", starring Roma Downey,to be released).
Oh, Diary, I was sorely disappointed with the cover art of the DVD case...the lady in the pink jacket is actually Mrs. Onassis herself, not Joanne Whalley, who plays Mrs. Onassis in this film. Why?  Plus, Mrs. Kennedy is wearing her Inaguration outfit, which was originally an off-white/tan, and is now pink!  Probably to mimic Mrs. Onassis' most famous outfit of all (the strawberry pink dress that she wore that day in Dallas?)Enough about the cover art.

The movie itself, although a beautiful spectacle,is a bit of a letdown.  Joanne Whalley is wonderful as Jackie, especially with that voice of hers (her mimicry of Jackie's voice and mannerisms are dead-on, even to the way that she walks)...although Ms. Whalley seems a bit too mature to play Jackie as a teen/young woman, it seems to work...

My main problem with the movie is how it glosses over major parts of Mrs. Kennedy's life...the White House years are a mere seven minutes...we go from JFK's inauguration to the Cuban Missle Crisis within a matter of minutes; half a minute later, we're off to Dallas!  What?!  Although the restoration project is given airtime (maybe 45 seconds)the funeral scenes are impressive (maybe 5-7 minutes are given to this subject)...Jackie grieves and within minutes, 2 years have passed and we're being wooed by Onassis...Jackie discusses with RFK her intention to wed Onassis and then we're at the wedding...what happened to RFK's murder?  I honestly don't remember the movie even mentioning it.

Dear Diary, I'm not saying that the movie is horrible or even bad. It's just that a woman of Ms. Kennedy Onassis' stature should have been given more time for the audience to get to know her.  In this version, her motivations aren't clear because so much factual info has been rushed or ignored.  However, my completist heart has been quenched by this newest addition to my ""Kennedy library"".",1326240000,20,2270,4.9447368421052635
4897805,2,B005VUTRGW,Another docudrama based on the life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. With all the footage  available and now even the personal tapes of this woman's recollections and observations you would think someone would be able to make a half way decent documentary. I am sure the public that loved loved and admired her would much prefer that,1324339200,8,331,4.910714285714286
4897806,4,B005VUTRGW,"This television miniseries focuses on Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis and does have a tendency to overplay the 'villains' (the portrayals of Aristotle and Christina Onassis are completely baffling unless you know more about Jackie's complex relationships with the Onassis camp) and underplay several key aspects of her life (Jack Kennedy's infidelity, the tempestuous relationship with her mother, the estrangement from Aristotle). It has never been advertised or represented as a documentary and while many aspects of her life are either dramatized or shoved to the side, Joanne Whalley does carry herself off well as Jackie throughout the years.  Using a combination of tenacity and tenderness, she shows us the ups and downs of a life lived mainly (though mostly unwillingly) in the public eye.  The real Mrs. Onassis was a tall woman, but Joanne Whalley carries herself with true style, bringing forth a portrayal of an American icon with style, sophistication and wit.  She's a very talented lady and this could not have been an easy role for her to take on.

For a more complete and historically accurate telling of the Camelot years and of Mrs. Onassis in general, PBS' American Experience aired the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-American-Experience-The-Kennedys/dp/B000BITUKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The American Experience: The Kennedys</a>&nbsp;as well as dedicating a separate episode to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackie-Behind-the-Myth/dp/B0002NY8GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackie - Behind the Myth</a>",1321747200,9,1631,6.502304147465438

This is what made me think the actress looked just like her and why I bought it. I didn't notice this until I got it in-person and looked closer. Great editing and cinematography. HORRIBLE WRITING and the actress never once made me believe I was looking at Mrs. Onassis. I adore Jackie and 9 times out of 10 biopics done on her....except this! The Katie Holmes version ""The Kennedys"" is a lot better. This one moved WAY TOO FAST and way to slowwww. VERY BAD.

4897834,4,B005VUTRGW,"This movie provides good background scenarios explaining certain things about her parents, especially her father ""Black Jack"" Bouvier. Not every movie in which Jackie Kennedy is portrayed does that in such a creative way. I wish this movie showed a little more about Jackie's personal talents and her process of growing up to become a lady of fine culture. A short scene of her happily studying French would have been cute. I do like the inclusion of Aristotle Onassis's family issues concerning the marriage and the scene of how Jackie wound up losing him, through seemingly no fault of her own. The scenes and dialogue made it interesting to point out that their problems between each other had nothing to do with politics or the fact that he was not American. A couple of spotlights on JFK, Jr., and not only about him as a young child were nice to see, though don't expect an overload of those.

The actress playing Jackie in this movie doesn't look stunningly like the real Jackie physically. More like just another very attractive brunette imitating her. To see the absolute best likeness of the real Jackie, have a glimpse at actress Blair Brown playing her in  ""Kennedy - The Complete Series"" starring Martin Sheen.

Tim Matheson tries with obvious effort to pass for JFK in every aspect of what many of us have learned about him in books and from TV documentaries. However, if you've seen this actor in other movies before (most notably as college party boy Otter in National Lampoon's ""Animal House""), while watching this movie it may be somewhat  hard to take the focus off the fact that it's Tim Matheson.

If you're interested in who so far is the best resemblance of John F. Kennedy is as an actor playing him, Greg Kinnear in the miniseries ""The Kennedys"" is the one.",1393545600,5,1782,4.717041800643087

4897843,5,B005VUTRGW,"When Jackie Bouvier met John Kennedy she had no intentions of marrying Jack in the least, but decided to marry him after he proposed to her.

Joanne Whalley did an outstanding performance of portraying the most prominent First Lady in America, and with Tim Matherson (John F. Kennedy) by her side, the saga of Camelot began.

Watching this dvd I can not but wonder about their marriage, as I got the impression that it was no different from the millions of other marriages of the time. Jacqueline married for love, suffered her husband's career, fell out of love because Jack was never home for her. His womanizing and drinking was made public because of his very public life.

John's career became more and more important to him than his wife, and without noticing, his life with his beautiful wife was falling apart. His career was pushed by his father's ambitions, as his career was ended, so pushed his sons to do what he could not accomplish.

Jacqueline was a loyal, committed, caring and supportive woman who loved her husband despite what she knew was going on in his own private life. She was a very strong and determined woman.

As a child she was born into privilege, but a broken home gave her the strength to later endure more than most. While her often heartbroken marriage to John F. Kennedy made her want to say, ""No more"", her strength and intelligence made her strive to keep it together, without the help of her husband.

She endeared herself to a nation, and in some respects and her many admirers worldwide, and in the days that followed her husband's assassination in Dallas, most peoples' hearts went out to her as she came to grips with what happened.

It sounds like any marriage to me, but it had an entire nation, and the world as it's stage. What marriage could possibly survive the public for that long? It is hard for a woman to bury a husband she loved, despite his failings, so imagine the pain she had to endure as a world turned out to share their pain with her.

With the help of family she prevailed, and by a chance, met an old friend Aristotle Onassis, whose friendship turned to her. With the assassination of Robert, Jacqueline, I believe, was pushed and eventually fell for Aristotle.

Tragedy struck again with the death of Aristotle's son, Alexander, and her divorce to Aristotle.

Towards the end of her life she said that she was so blessed despite all the loneliness and tragedy, she found love in her old and dear friend Maurice, that she had found nowhere else.

Jacqueline's story is one of the many stories women have to endure during their lives, and yet survive admit the turmoil to walk out the other end stronger for the experience. But to be in the public limelight most of her life, especially since that day in Dallas, would have put so much more burden on her shoulders than most people could carry.

This dvd is definitely five star material, and I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in a bit more of the story that was Camelot, and a lady who endured much.",1370908800,,3029,4.588888888888889
4897844,4,B005VUTRGW,"Mainly due to the fact, I like biographies. It was a bit short, but there are things in which to learn about our past leaders and their wives in America's past traditions. She was very much loved internationally and spoke several different languages which was a great help to her husband. She was also a very important aspect of our love by other nations at the time.",1367798400,2,367,4.492537313432836
