4846273,3,B005NFJAV2,"I just saw it as blu ray and bought it, but after i bought it and played it i felt there was a problem with the resolution, I have seen the 1080p quality in a friend's home, it was so beautiful. Then i looked around the blu ray to see it as 1080i. Very disappointed!! At least they should have mentioned it in the product description...",1339459200,5,336,4.106060606060606
4846274,5,B005NFJAV2,"I have tons of blu-ray trilogies from Star Wars to Matrix to the Mummy.  While I love to watch the movies for the story and action, I can honestly say my eyes love to watch this the most.  The BBC series is the best eye-candy programming I have ever seen. I like it so much that I bought two more copies for no other reason than to share it family and friends in a lending-library type, where people who know me can simply borrow the other one of the copies and see and share it with their friends and family.

IMHO, anyone who gives this less than 5 stars is a person 1) who hasn't seen the blu-ray, 2) can't afford it or got the DVD versions, or 3) has in-home IMAX theater system.  Get this for your friends and family, and one for yourself, too.",1338854400,,749,4.109589041095891
4846275,5,B005NFJAV2,This is the best in nature filming brought together in one package. David Attenborough  lends his brilliant voice to some of the finest scenery and animal cultures this world can provide.,1337385600,,187,5.032258064516129
4846276,5,B005NFJAV2,"Saw this on NatGeo or Discovery a few months ago and it was breathtaking, the HD quality is incredible and will leave you mesmerized for hours. I highly recommend this.",1335052800,3,168,4.633333333333334
4846277,5,B005NFJAV2,"One of the best visual displays of some rare beauties of occurancies through out earth. Many parts of the film are memorizing when viewed in HD. If you have blu-ray capability, then do not buy the DVD version as this is something that needs to be watched with the best picture possible.",1335052800,18,286,4.519230769230769
4846278,5,B005NFJAV2,"This is simply a repackaging of two TV series that have already been released previously.

Having said that, these are probably the two highest-quality nature shows ever filmed, so if you don't yet own them then I highly recommend this set.  These are the original BBC versions of the show, with the great narration by David Attenborough.  This is the preferred way to watch these shows, because the Discovery Channel versions of the show is known to have cut/missing footage and most agree that it's a much lower-quality narration.

There are 10 discs in this set: Life is a 4-disc set, and Planet Earth: Special Edition is a 6-disc set.

The audio and video quality on these discs is outstanding.  The images are vibrant and the photography is breathtaking - this is the kind of content that HDTV was meant for!

4846282,3,B005NFJAV2,"5+ stars for content and -2 for the overblown price-tag.  This is basically re-packaging of two existing BBC documentaries with some extras thrown in.  The extras and the new packaging would surely be a gem for some people and my intentions are not to demean the content of this package but to point out it's high expense in comparison to other options on Amazon.  Usually the first two documentaries someone purchases after being introduced to the world of BBC nature documentaries is Planet Earth and Life.  This particular set would not be the best way for most people to start their collection.

If you're interested in getting the most for your money then this would be an extremely bad choice.  At the time this was written the price was $91.  In comparison, at this time for $95, you could get The BBC High-Definition Natural History Collection 1 and 2.  These are both Blu Ray box sets with multiple documentaries included in each.  The BBC N.H.C. 1 has -  Planet Earth, Wild China, Galapagos and Ganges.  The BBC N.H.C. 2 has -  Life, Nature's Most Amazing Events, South Pacific, and Yellowstone.  The version of Life included in N.H.C. 2 is the same version offered here, narrated by David Attenborough.  In this alternate route you would get 8 documentaries instead of two.  I wanted to pass this information along to those who may be new to these incredible BBC documentaries and to those who are looking to add as many as possible within their budget.  Another pointer to anyone new to these BBC documentaries is that you should avoid any of the ""Americanized"" versions because there are truly inferior.  In the American version of Life, narrated by Oprah Winfrey, they take a BBC masterpiece and transform it into an average piece of work.  I hope this info is helpful to some or you out there.",1453161600,9,1808,4.722044728434505

4846287,5,B005NFJAV2,"Great TV series's for anyone that isn't already familiar with them.  Only annoyance is that for the spines of the sleeves to face outwards, you have to put the sleeves in facing the opposite direction of the box - in other words, when resting the box face-up, you have to put the sleeves in face down to expose the spines.

Blurays add some behind the scenes features and stories that I haven't noticed on TV broadcasts or Netflix.",1432598400,2,431,4.512820512820513

4846299,5,B005NFJAV2,"Make sure you get the David Attenborough narration.  The Sigourney Weaver and Oprah ones aren't the worst I can imagine, but I just think Attenborough is a much more appropriate and knowledgeable narrator for this program.

Visual quality is amazing, sound very much the same.  If you're looking for something to show off your new TV, this will work perfectly.",1413676800,2,360,4.966666666666667

4846304,1,B005NFJAV2,I did not buy the life documentary to constantly hear about evolution.  If you want to make a documentary on evolution please do! But don't hijack a documentary showing the beauty of our current natural world!  Their was no point to constantly discuss evolution.  It just made the documentary more boring and seem like a propaganda tool.  Which I guarantee their agenda was to use this to push evolution.  Not everyone believes in or even cares about evolution.,1408492800,3,461,4.858974358974359
4846305,3,B005NFJAV2,"I got this set back in April (brand new) since it was on a good sale, but just opened it up this week and found out I had multiple scratches on multiple disks - some of them looking pretty severe.  Thankfully I have not had any playback issues on the disc with the most severe scratches, but I still have a few more disks to go through before I can rest easy on the matter.

This is a great series collection otherwise.",1405900800,,419,4.097560975609756
4846306,5,B005NFJAV2,"I own the standard DVD American-market version of Life, and I watched all episodes of both series on Discovery Channel.  I am ecstatic that David Attenborough's versions are now available to Region 1.  Don't miss out.  The watered-down scripts and the annoying commercial-break fade-outs in the American-market DVDs are gone.  And having watched each of the Life episodes many times on American TV, I noticed right away the extended scenes on the Blu-ray discs.  Naturally the resolution is much crisper than the standard DVDs and can be appreciated with all the necessary close-ups needed to film small animal and plant life.  In Life ""Plants"", you can almost touch the dew droplets on the sundew, and the Venus flytrap looks like it will jump out and grab you.  And I've never seen a fly's eyes with such clarity!  Sorry Oprah, sorry Sigourney.  I love you both, but Sir Attenborough needs to handle this business.  He brings both experience and gravitas to his rich narration.",1402531200,2,979,4.950920245398773

4846313,5,B005NFJAV2,The item was delivered earlier than expected which was great. It was carefully packaging and the item was in mint condition from the outside.

I would certainly purchase other products from this seller.,1398124800,,311,4.473684210526316
4846314,5,B005NFJAV2,"David Attenborough is one of the greats to take you on the tour, and the photography is unmatched - DEFINITELY purchase on Blu-Ray for the HD.

My only ""gripe"" is the fact they jump around a LOT when it comes to location or type of creature... I think the producers had ADD. It does still flow well though.",1392508800,,306,4.275862068965517
4846315,2,B005NFJAV2,"Despite the many accolades heaped upon Mr. Attenborough, I believe Sigourney Weaver is the better narrator. After listening to Attenborough for a mere 30 minutes, I find myself having flashbacks of my middle school years.  Attenborough's voice lack inflection - if you're not careful, you could find yourself dozing off, despite the  beautiful cinematography artfully displayed in the series.

I do hope that more versions of ""Planet Earth"" series narrated by Sigourney Weaver are made available on Amazon at price comparable to the soporific versions narrated by Mr. Attenborough.",1390953600,,581,5.50561797752809
4846316,3,B005NFJAV2,Amazing DVD's but non of the LIFE ones worked in any bluray players or playstation 3's that i tried.  For some strange reason they did work in a playstation 4.,1388620800,,159,4.3

4846318,5,B005NFJAV2,"I really like how Life came out with a David Attenborough version. He helps to make the animals and natural scencery as engaging as if you were there and I can really tell he enjoys narrating. I can't really say much about the DVD's themselves; I've been watching them consistently since they have come out and are probably the most watched DVD's I own. Unbelievable scenery, amazing wildlife, this series will be tough to beat.",1373846400,,428,4.72

4846333,5,B005NFJAV2,Such amazing film and good narration. I watch this over and over whenever my girlfriend and I are bored. It is some of the most inspiring shots. Beautiful animals in their natural habitat. I am so glad I bought this and have it by my TV to watch. Add this to your collection. One of the best purchases Ive made.,1370390400,,311,4.2
4846334,5,B005NFJAV2,"Excellent videography just like the Planet Earth. As the focus is on how human adapt to survive in some of the harshest parts of the earth, it is a good complement to Planet Earth. You will be truly impressed with how creative men can be to survive. Highly recommended.",1370217600,,269,4.510204081632653
4846335,4,B005NFJAV2,"I love the planet earth and life blu ray set but what I will say is that I'm a little disappointed by the HD in the planet earth discs.  I don't know if it's just because they are older or what.  The life discs seem to be much more clear and mind-blowing!  I think I was expecting amazing clarity and that's just not what I got with the planet earth.  I have a fancy 3D LED Samsung flat screen television and I was a little disappointed by the clarity.  I love the set though, it is truly amazing.",1369008000,,497,4.030612244897959

4846354,5,B005NFJAV2,"This is an experience of immersion into life itself.  A direct interaction with multiple species and adaptations.  Presents the viewer as  both witness and participant the opportunity to learn and reflect on nature's diversity, beauty and relentless give and take for survival and thriving. So much I didn't know. Let me discover the deep empathy and similarity with life forms.
Beautiful photography and music that enhances the environment.  Intimate revealing portraits that take you beyond the egocentric world of humans.
Though I had watched Attenborough's bird  anthologies, and Blue Sea Life offers  a further feast for the senses and heightens  understanding of who shares this planet and how remarkable, fragile and evolving we are. And how and why we must become aware and participate in cooperatively conserving and responding to the needs of all forms of Life!

Eagerly look forward",1359590400,,893,5.328571428571428
4846355,5,B005NFJAV2,"I am so amazed by the shows BBC puts out. This is __THE BEST__ filming, storytelling, and editing you can get on this subject. Some of the shots they got were simply breathtaking. They almost seem staged.

I love the little behind the scenes they have at the end of the episodes that talk about how much of a mission these films are. I don't even own a Blu-Ray player, but I bought this to show my support and hope they continue to make these great films.",1359072000,,455,4.2298850574712645

4846357,5,B005NFJAV2,I'm currently on deployment and whenever my shipmates and I have some downtime we throw this series in and thouroughly enjoy it. David Attenborough has become a legend in our berthing and we always cheer for him whenever he first starts his narration. He brings everything to you in such a great narrative that it feels like he's personally behind each camera during every experience. Everyone on board has really enjoyed this and I encourage anyone that is considering it to purchase this.,1358553600,2,490,4.9156626506024095

One of the best documentary series I've ever seen!  My children alternate between Life and Planet Earth.  we're about halfway thru, there are many hours of entertainment here.  This is one of the times where I fully appreciate HD1080p resolution!

PACKAGING :3 of 5 stars

well, the combo box packaging is actually hard to get the sets out of.  I've considered several times taking the discs out and putting them in their own CD zip case, if nothing else to keep from wearing out the box set.",1356393600,,675,4.533333333333333

The documentary itself is great, though, and I'm pretty sure this blu-ray version jas more stuff on it than the DVD version so I don't feel like it warrants anything lower than a 3 even though I now own 2 versions of it.",1350691200,,458,3.9782608695652173

4846381,3,B005NFJAV2,"First of all, Planet Earth is awesome. I wish I could say the same for ""Life"" but I couldn't watch it!!

The Disc didn't work in my Sony Blu Ray Player. I contacted the seller, Simon Tang, and he said he'd ship me a replacement.

The replacement never came.

I contacted him and he said there must have been a mix up and he just shipped it out and I should have it in a week.

Again, 3 weeks later, still no replacement. Now it's way past the 30 day return policy and I got scammed out of half my purchase because the seller, Simon Tang screwed me.

BEWARE OF Simon Tang. Buy from some other reputable vendor.",1345939200,9,609,4.127118644067797

4846383,5,B005NFJAV2,"This collection is excellent. I have watched this series in other oportunity and I think than this edition has two of better nature series that I have watched. Although this edition is on Blueray, both documentals are in 1080i, but video quality very is good and  sound is great.

I really have enjoyed it again.",1344729600,,312,4.654545454545454
4846384,5,B005NFJAV2,"Don't know what I can add that hasn't been said, but to reiterate ...

The cinematography on this set is simply out of this world! If you're watching on a blu-ray player, with a quality Hi-Def TV, you're going to feel like you're there!! If you're watching on a DVD player, with a mediocre TV, you will see the production level on this set is such that it will STILL make a viewing difference.

The production quality of these two programs is of the best quality. And David Attenborough is one of my favorite narrators.

So, in short - if you're at ALL on the fence (why, when the reviews are so high!?), simply do yourself a favor and buy this set!",1344643200,,649,4.30327868852459
4846385,1,B005NFJAV2,"Before I go on, note that I'm not knocking the content of either series in the least.  We all know how amazing the production is, and I do prefer David Attenborough over Sigourney Weaver as well.  I purchased the original Planet Earth set when they first came out on Blu-ray and absolutely loved them!  Apparently I loved them too much, as the 2nd disc in the set got a scratch on it and would no longer play, much to my chagrin.

Then I saw this awesome set for a great sale price on Amazon!  I bought it, eagerly awaited it's arrival, and when it came popped them right into the player.  Something was wrong though... something was... off.  Was this a bootleg copy?  Why was the picture quality lower?

Then I saw on the packaging that it's 1080i instead of 1080p.  If you're not familiar with the difference, let me explain.  'i' stands for interlaced, which means when the frames change, instead of the whole frame changing at once only half the frame changes (in a 'window blinds' pattern), then the next half etc, so that the motion is staggered.  Back in the heyday of interlaced television, when you were dealing with a 19"" tube TV with low-definition, relatively static imagery this actually made for a smoother transition.  Nowadays, when you're on a LARGE, HD screen with a lot of motion--which is the situation most people are going to be in when buying blu-rays instead of DVD's--it makes a staggering negative impact.  So you know that awesome shot of that howler monkey flying through the trees?  Well now he leaves behind a stripey trail.  That amazing opening video when it's zoomed in on the flock of birds and then slowly zooms out to show the MILLIONS of them?  Now when it zooms out all the tiny birds are lost in lines and you don't get the sense of the enormity of it all.

If you're not buying this to take advantage of the amazing detail and clarity that normally comes with blu-ray discs, then by all means enjoy your purchase!  If you are, you may want to think twice about this set, do a bit of research through Google to find out which sets are 1080p (and believe me, there's plenty of discussion about it), and grab one of them instead.

To me, when you're buying the newest blu-ray set of something, you're expecting the highest quality video and audio.  The bottom line is that this particular set is the worst quality of any of the several Planet Earth packaging out there.",1344124800,8,2406,4.523148148148148

Don't have to hear Oprah narrate Life.
DVD extras are finally on the Blue-Ray discs.  Bout time!!
Amazing footage and narration.

4846388,4,B005NFJAV2,"Just bought this complete set when I come over to US, it's almost half price compared to HK!!

Going back to the topic, I read through lots of comment, not only in Amazon, also some other sites. People arguing about the video format (1080i vs 1080p), I took a chance to test a few disc with PS3 in the office right before my flight, I picked 2 discs from Life as well as 2 from Planet Earth. Both discs picked from Life are in 1080p format while both I picked from Planet Earth are 1080i. Outside the box only 1080i is mentioned, so the description is partially correct.

From my research, the only 1080p version of Planet Earth should be the one selling in UK, and it's a 5-disc version (still 1 disc less than the US version), and with region code restrictions.

I do find little quality difference among Life & Planet Earth, but this price I would say it's unbeatable!! The only 1 star deducted is about the packaging, can it be a more rigid box rather paper?",1340150400,5,962,4.333333333333333

8480422,4,B005NFJAV2,"I never got to see the complete series for both untill now. The British versions are way better than our US Broadcast versions seen on TV. No commercial cuts and no Oprah. XD

There are a few downsides but they are very minor. ""Life"" recycled a fair bit of content from ""Planet Earth"" and they almost constantly used a film grain effect that hinders the image quality. Too many films use it. XD

Another issue is that the ""Planet Earth"" discs are packaged in sleeves. Scratch magnets. XD

Overall though, both of the documentaries are great. Anyone who loves nature will love this package. Go for it!",1495324800,2,600,4.588785046728972
