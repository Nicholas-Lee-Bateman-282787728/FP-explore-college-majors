8273099,4,B00199OTHQ,I showed this to my environmental science class and they seemed to get a lot out of it.  So did I.,1372723200,,98,3.6666666666666665
8273100,5,B00199OTHQ,"this is a must see film, even if you think you understand energy use and going green, this film and it's statistics will blow you away.
did you know every kwh uses 1 pound of coal, and that the Appalachian mountains are being blown up and leveled to get to the coal, and that an environmental disaster larger than any seen east of the Mississippi was caused by this mining and it's all been kept secret? do you think nuclear power is the answer? do you know the risks and that is is NOT clean energy at all.",1271980800,2,507,4.183673469387755
8273101,5,B00199OTHQ,"This DVD has more impact than thousands of words and has the ability to turn energy-groupies into individuals changing specific actions and habits to make a difference in energy consumption, energy costs, and energy impact on themselves and communities throughout the world.  NIMBY's - take notice.  This IS in your back yard.",1260230400,,326,5.25
8273102,5,B00199OTHQ,The best thing about this documentary is that it doesn't just tell us we have a problem--it provides real examples of solutions.  After watching this film my family made some immediate changes and we are looking into more significant changes in the future.,1245542400,,256,4.953488372093023
8273103,5,B00199OTHQ,"The first time I saw this film, I was blown away at the consequences of our current energy supply...in particular the mountaintop removal coal mining.  And I immediately went home and changed every lightbulb in my house to a compact flourescent.  One segment of the film shows over 400 mountains that have been victim of mountaintop removal.  400 doesn't sound like a lot, but when you see the flags designating mountains that no longer exist on the map, it really hits home.  The BEST thing about this film, is that it focuses mainly on the SOLUTION...things that people are already doing to save energy and money.  The DVD also includes a short feature film, Jeff and Heather's Energy Tips, that shows low cost things you can do right in your own home, that can result in savings up to $1000 per year.  This is a great film to own on DVD to watch again and again and share with family and friends.",1236643200,,899,4.518518518518518
