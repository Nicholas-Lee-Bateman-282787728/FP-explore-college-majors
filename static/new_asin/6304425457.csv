Looks Like It Was Produced In Someone's Backyard...By The Snobby, Agnostic, Descendants Of The Very Same Hateful People That Burned Jeanne To Death.  may 30, 1431. After 10 minutes of this insulting mess, i threw it in the  trash.",950140800,19,292,4.705882352941177
7871149,1,6304425457,"I really do not feel good in writing negative reviews on anything, specially on Joan of Arc Movies. Anyhow, I really have nothing good to mentioned about this tape, except that it is a very difficult task to  understand the English they speak. These are the names on the movie.  Written by Hilary Pooler; Narrated by Liz Beswick; Produced & Directed  by Jeremy Freeston; Joan of Arc Played by Catherine Sage; and Inquisitor  Played by John Carvin. I never heard anything about them.
I wouldn't say  it is absolutely unworthy buying it, but only do it if you are a Joan of  Arc movies' collector.",948758400,9,595,4.619047619047619
