4461742,5,B004RV70U6,"This is very worthwhile history.  The commentaries by historians Ian Kershaw, Briggitte Hamann and Goetz Aly are worth the price of admission alone. Each of these three is a noted historian and author, each offers insight in their particular area of expertise, and each substantively augments a clearer picture of what happened to the viewer.  Their collective contributions are the reason this documentary is better than any other I have seen on the Third Reich.  The disc runs over three hours, but it is divided into equal parts to facilitate watching it over the course of a few evenings.  This documentary is a well balanced and unbiased presentation of the facts.  The creators did not fall into the trap of making excessive value judgements about the events, a common fault with most documentaries on this difficult subject.  Rather the events and pictures speak for themselves, the interpretations are left to the three professional authorities.  There is better writing, better visuals, and better and more in-depth interpretation in this film than anything I have seen heretofore. Highest recommendation.",1379980800,12,1114,5.259887005649717
4461743,4,B004RV70U6,"I liked this DVD.  The authors did a good job summarizing the rise and fall of the Third Reich.  I especially enjoyed the narrator , Ian Kershaw who has written a biography of Hilter , which I have not yet read, but after viewing this DVD am looking forward to reading.  Well worth the money if you have not seen many WWII flicks on the subject.  Entertaining and informative.  I had not seen 85 percent of the video scenes of Hitler's Germany on this DVD.

4461746,4,B004RV70U6,"if havent' watched much on Hitler's rise to power ..this is a good one. Although you might want to get some other ones too. This one is not to expensive..so it is worth at least $15 . I had left that this was a ""repetitive"" documentary...but althought this might be somewhat true. The documentary is quite thorough and good and has quite a lot of information , good interviews, and plenty of film on the Third Reich. What I also really like about it is that it is 4 hours long and has SUBTITLES...that way you can just turn the volume down and read the information without the annoying ""noises"" that many documentaries seem to have these days.

I would recommend . (especially for $15~!)",1339718400,,687,4.496
4461747,5,B004RV70U6,"This program really is tops, it gives a very inside story of what was one of the most feared periods of modern times. Its viewing is worthwhile regardless of how one sees the Third Reich.",1330214400,2,187,4.371428571428571

""On the 30TH of January, 1933, a cheering crowd of Hitler's followers marched through Bradenburg Gate holding torches after his appointment as Reich Chancellor.  12 years, 3 months, and 9 days, everything [was] over.""

The above comes at the end of this fascinating documentary.

It is well-narrated and has comments throughout by three famous historians of the Third Reich: Sir Ian Kershaw, Brigitte Hamann, and Gotz Aly.

This program is divided into the following parts:

(1) 1933 to 1935
(2) 1936 to early 1939
(3) late 1939 to early 1942
(4) late 1942 to 1945.

This documentary traces such things as the politics, day to day life, the war years, and the Third Reich's crimes.

And the film footage (some in colour) is just fantastic with hardly any blemishes (which you would not expect).  In some cases, there is rare previously unpublished amateur footage.

Finally, there are subtitles and there are no extras.

In conclusion, this is truly a fascinating documentary with good narration and interesting comments made by three famous historians.  I leave you with the legacy of Hitler's regime:

""16 million dead.""

Young people of today do not really understand the horrors that took place at that time, & are often mislead into believing the Holocaust was an elaborate hoax",1313884800,3,333,4.859649122807017
4461751,4,B004RV70U6,"Judge Victor Valdivia, DVD Verdict-- Chronicle of the Third Reich mixes archival footage with interviews with historians and authors, most notably Sir Ian Kershaw, author of a well-known biography of Hitler. There are no interviews with surviving Germans, Jews, WWII veterans, or any other witnesses. There are also no reenactments or battlefield maps; this isn't that kind of show. Director Michael Kloft has made several previous TV documentaries on this subject (such as Television Under the Swastika) and he demonstrates here that when he finds an approach that works, he can deliver an excellent summary of this story with a unique perspective that even history buffs will find enthralling.

Chronicle of the Third Reich, then, is an excellent Nazi history, combining the best of historical analysis with documentary footage to make a series that even viewers used to WWII programs can enjoy. Some may find that it shortchanges a couple of key areas (battles and survivor stories key amongst them) but those are covered in so many other places that it hardly seems necessary. Moreover, the techniques that Kloft uses here, such as ironically contrasting Nazi propaganda footage with raw unreleased footage of what actually happened, are illustrative of his central thesis of how the Nazis used deception to wield their power and how the German people allowed themselves, for various reasons, to be deceived and led to ruin. It may not be the definitive account of this story (if such a thing can ever truly exist) but if you're at all interested in history, it's worth seeing.

Technical specs are standard: anamorphic 1.78:1 transfer, stereo mix, both satisfactory. The archival footage can look a bit rough at times, but that's to be expected. There are no extras.

World War 2 was so Calamitous that those who are moved to inquire should read these books.
I do not trust the schools to tell the History because the Teachers simply do not have time with
all their demands which we make on them.  In addition we have never paid enough money to our school-teachers.
Teaching of any sort is a most demanding Profession, leading to Mental Breakdown.
Parents do not realize that their children are needing real big money to build the Nation, and to speak English correctly.",1414800000,2,551,4.729166666666667

The producer who put this together also did some french television documentaries utilizing over 70% NEW footage that had not seen the light of day on the countless other Documentaries on WWII. Worth the price and multiple viewings!
Highly Recommended.
