8568494,5,B00BHIQH3S,"Well, I admittedly hesitated before ordering this video because I liked the old Bike-O-Vision Grand Canyon & Sedona title enough, I didn't really want to spend the money on a whole new trip there.  But now Im glad I did because this is one special ride!  I got the impression that whoever is doing these videos really love these places and put a lot of effort into capturing them.  This new look at Sedona is vividly exciting and really energizes my workout.
The Painted Desert section is maybe a bit more toned-down but has some unique aspects.  Theres something very pretty about the way the sagebrush gives way to the various patterns of eroded sand in the late afternoon light.  The ride itself is mostly flat-land but good for getting up a good long-distance pace.  Overall- a gorgeous ride for a great value!",1410566400,3,814,4.6573426573426575
