8180610,1,B000NQ28MO,"while the movie itself is very good, the quality of this DVD SUX. It looks like someone took an old VHS tape and converted it using some off the shelf software. There was a bright white line down the left side of the screen for most of the movie. Had I purchased this at a Dollar store, I would have taken it back. BTW- you can see the same quality of this movie on YouTube for free. save your money.",1503964800,,400,4.0125
