8308292,5,B001HB1JVK,The guys and I watched this docutainment movie. I thought it was funny and pure Americana. Let it tickle your inner-aisler. [...],1247702400,,129,4.909090909090909
8308293,4,B001HB1JVK,"We used to live in Columbia, MO where this was filmed.  It was really fun for us to see this movie two years ago at the True/False Film Festival, but we bought it because while it's extremely funny, the stories of my former townspeople really touched my heart.  We all have wonderful life stories to share.  Some good, some not so good, but we don't often have a chance to share them in our busy lives.",1231632000,,402,4.2631578947368425
8308294,5,B001HB1JVK,"If you liked films like Waiting for Guffman or Best in Show, you must see this one. Imagine those films but with the main characters all being real people.
Once again, reality outdoes fiction. Great fun and also very touching!",1227139200,,226,4.675
