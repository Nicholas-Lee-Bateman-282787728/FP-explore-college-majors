If you thought ALIENS was good, then this is the movie for you! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time the movie was playing on TBS. This is sooo worth the [amt]. I mean, the alien can set the amount for firepower his gun shoots! One time he blows up a truck, and the other time he only wants to stun the guy. Oh by the way, i jumped out of my seat when the Murdercycle jumped out at the group from inside a building. He is a cold blooded killer. But that is just some of the action of this action packed riveter. HOpe to see you all at the Murdercycle MOVIES. nick yee for life!",1003104000,8,752,4.122448979591836
192304,5,1573470821,"Murdercycle is da bomb! The special effects are great!! I'll give you a preview. A guy is attacked by an alien on a motorcycle. Some people go looking for the guy. A lady named Lee, who is a Psychic, two men who are from the CIA, and the rest, an army squd. They are attacked by the Murdercycle shortly. One of the guys named Wood(what a name) is such a jerk, you just want to [hurt] him, is hidding something from everybody, even from the other CIA guy(forgot his name). They find the guy who they were looking for, who was killed, but they stumble onto something else. They find a guy named Dikko(what another name) who was a friend of the guy who was killed. Thats all I'm telling you. If you want to know what happens you'll have to rent it or buy it. SEE YA!!!!!!",993081600,,768,4.195945945945946
192305,4,1573470821,"Dazzling Special Effects...NO!  Breath Taking Scenes...NO!  Top Notch Actors...NO!  Excellent Visual Effect...NO!  A pretty good Action/Sci-Fi w/ a decent cast and not too corny dialouge....YES!  This is a  Full Moon  Pictures/ActionXTreme release that really isn't all that bad.  True the  Title is kinda goofy, but it does have a story line!  An alien meteorite  thing lands on earth and transform a no one on a dirty bike, into an  Advanced Alien killing machine!  The story develops around the characters  trying to destroy the Alien to save earth, of course. This movie has a  twist or two, and keeps going till the end.  It gets a little slow in one  part, but then the alien pops back up and then the movie is back on  track...Rent and buy this video!",958867200,3,758,4.744186046511628

7798307,4,1573470821,"This Sci-Fi/Horror shocker from 1998 is an edge of the seat thrill ride from start to finish. The action never lets up. It keeps up and keeps you guessing until the bitter end.

It all starts when a meteorite crashes onto earth in a top secret government zone and possesses an innocent motorbike rider who has seemed to lost his way. He soon turns into an unstoppable killing machine and is determined on keeping it's immortality even if it means killing anybody who is intent on stopping him. A team of US marine soldiers led by a female psychic are using everything in their power to stop the reign of terror by this phantom motor bike rider. The psychic finds a way that this can be done,but she knows that she has to race against time to save herself and the soldiers. Will she succeed? Will the soldiers win? Can they together STOP the phantom rider's reign of terror once and for all?

Never in the tradition of films such as Duel, The Car, Christine, Maximum Overdrive, Wheels Of Terror and Trucks has a movie had been able to carry you over the edge. While those movies are entertaining in their own right, none of them can even equal the power of this thriller. Murdercycle is strictly in a class by itself. Murdercycle is an edge of the seat thrill ride with non-stop action and thrills and some very good acting performances by the cast.

If you are a fan of non-stop action Sci-Fi/Horror films, this one is for you. Murdercycle is an action packed thrill ride to enjoy again and again.",1415836800,,1497,4.4963235294117645
7798308,1,1573470821,"In our world where people are starving to death as we speak, it's sad that some people got a bunch of money together and spent it on this piece of crap movie.",1285286400,,158,3.96875
7798309,2,1573470821,"""Murdercycle"" is an epically stupid and cheap motion picture. The premise is that a meteor falls from outer space near a guy on a dirt bike and he transmogrifies into the murdercycle, making the US defenseless against attack, at least in this one flea-bitten western town.

By way of backstory, Sergeant Kirby is facing severe disciplinary action by the Marine Corps. Despite the obvious negative security ramifications, they pick him to lead a top secret mission to find the murdercycle. There is the obligatory psychic woman love interest angle which, in turn, yields the stupidest psychobabble ever uttered outside of Washington, DC.

All of this is covering up a truly pathetic CIA plot of some vague type, which for budgetary reasons (presumably) occurs in the ghost town of Prairie Dog, Colorado. There are numerous silly plotpoints to be seen: the murdercycle's blood smells like motor oil; an injured Marine is shot because he is in pain; there's a freedom fighter nerd in a barn; and the film ultimately reveals that the ""whole area is a hotbed of alien activity."" Presumably murdercycles are commonplace there; certainly the government's facilities are first-rate! The film all leads up to a very dramatic ending, which I won't spoil for you. I will, however, tell you that it's as least as stupid, contrived, and predictable as anything I have ever seen in any other film of any genre (and I have seen a lot of grade Z films.)

""Murdercycle"" is not a good movie; having said that, it is a good movie to mock, so if you want to have some friends over for a little cinematic cheese, this could be a good choice. If you want to be entertained by a movie that is well crafted or scary (or both,) this is not the film for you.",1240963200,2,1732,4.70957095709571
7798310,3,1573470821,"You can't expect much from a movie called ""Murdercycle"", but as C Grade Sci-Fi films go, it isn't all bad.

Sure, there's a lot of unintentional comedy (like lasers that don't seem capable of giving a human a minor, irritating skin rash and a psychic who can be repelled just by thinking bad thoughts at her), and the acting ranges from adequete to subpar.  But the film has a decent pace, and it kept me interested enough to watch to the end.  Plus, it's got an alien cyborg motorcycle!

One question though:  Why do all aliens / monsters have such grainy, blurry vision?  No wonder the Murdercycle kept missing with his stinging lasers of owie.",1139184000,4,646,4.573913043478261
7798311,3,1573470821,"I've seen hundreds of Sci Fi/Horror movies over the years.  This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road.  You just can't remember.

All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi/Horror movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.",1127001600,4,380,4.463768115942029
7798312,1,1573470821,"First of all, if your looking to be entertained in any kind of conventional sense, then this is definitley not the movie for you. But if your looking for a movie that you can laugh at other than with, then look no further. A Full Moon pictures release which should really say it all. Bad props, bad CGI effects, horrendous acting, and a plot that requires the films budget not exceed $500. At least the goresploitation flicks of the past offered some really gruesome visuals. Even the fake stuff was kind of creepy. But this CGI crap...Man! I saw the trailer for this on the ""Killer Eye"" movie (which I turned off after about 20 minutes) and ordered it to give my friend as a gag-gift because we constantly quote the trailer for kicks. ""Kill that damn rider!!!"" and ""This is ground zero for the INVASION!"". HAHAHAHAHA. Maybe Full Moon makes these films solely to play a joke on people? I hope so, cause the alternative is far scarier. Please stop....",1073952000,3,950,4.56140350877193
