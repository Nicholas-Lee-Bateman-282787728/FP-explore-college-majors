7988308,3,B00008ZL5K,"Everyone who complains about the faded yucky color in this Alpha Video version of ""The Witch's Curse"" is right, although I suspect it's hard to locate a decent-looking edition.  But what I have always liked about the movie is the outrageous notion of having brawny hero Maciste riding a horse into 17th Century misty Scotland!  He comes to the aid of a young lady who is being blamed for the local women hanging themselves from a gnarly tree, because she is descended from a witch named Martha Gunt who was burned there one hundred years before.  Martha Gunt had been one hot babe who grew into an old ugly witch, and she was ordered burned alive by a judge named Parris, who had been her lover.  Martha curses the village, which gets her innocent later namesake in trouble.

  Into this turmoil rides Maciste, who beats up the village men to defend the newlywed. Upon hearing the backstory of the curse, he uproots the hanging tree and wanders down into the Underworld where beautiful witch Martha and her lover Parris watch his progress on a kind of infernal television.  Maciste runs into such mythological personages as Prometheus, cursed for stealing fire from the gods by being eternally shackled to a rock while a buzzard chews on his innards.  Maciste clobbers the obviously stuffed bird, but another takes its place.  Our hero also encounters Sisyphus, condemned to forever roll a huge boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back down every time.  Another, much less friendly infernal resident he meets is Goliath, who constantly is roaring ""ARRRGGGHHH!"" and tries his best to beat Maciste up.  Then Maciste has to turn back a herd of rampaging steers, who get pushed down into a ravine.  I have an unpleasant feeling there were real injuries among the unwilling bovine extras for this stunt.  The movie was shot in the impressive Castellana Grotte in Bari, Apulia, Italy.

  At another point, to cheaply eat up some running time, Maciste is exhorted to look into a magic pool which replays for him scenes from his adventurous life (from previous Maciste movies).  Finally, the brave muscleman meets up with the stunning youthful version of witch Martha, who exhibits a kind nature by healing his badly burned hands.  Kirk Morris as Maciste and Helene Chanel as Martha are awesomely attractive young people.  Trying to judge acting in these dubbed movies is mainly pointless.  The players perform their chores at a physical level.  Maciste groans, sweats, and ripples his muscles in the service of good, and Martha makes dreamy eyes and smiles cryptically as the enchantingly gorgeous witch.  I especially liked the hair-raising music with chorus by Carlo Franci.  Too bad about the full-screen presentation and runny colors.  But I got a kick out of these Italian peplum movies when they ran on Chicago TV back in the mid-60s, and they are still quite brainless fun today. The notion of a young, mighty strongman adventuring around the world, righting wrongs and protecting the oppressed, is still an appealing concept.  The Italian peplum movies would vanish with the advent of ""spaghetti"" westerns and their cynical heroes.",1417910400,,3136,4.914448669201521
7988309,1,B00008ZL5K,"This is not a review about the film itself but the Alpha Video transfer: it's horrible. Really horrible. In fact, I believe this a complete ripoff. Who in their right mind believes that the transfer on this DVD is anything close to watchable? I'd like to see the folks from Alpha Video sit through it and try to watch it. I'm sure they could not watch it for more than 5 minutes.

Avoid this DVD at all cost. Hopefully the film will have a presentable transfer one of these days.",1210032000,4,479,4.322222222222222
7988310,1,B00008ZL5K,"I only gave this movie 1 star due mainly to the horrible quality of the dvd transfer. I would warn anyone buying vintage movies to check if it is a Alpha Video release. They consistently produce the worse quality movies imaginable. I have seen a number of different titles from them and the are shockingly poor. The With's Curse may be the worst. It is not even in color. It looks yellowish-brown...everything!

You have to go into the movie knowing it's just pure fantasy. In saying that, it is still bizarre that this gladiator shows up out of nowhere in 16th century Scotland to help right some wrong or stop injustice.

Still, I really like this movie. It's a lot of fun. I hope a real studio produces this title some day. For now, if you want it, you will have to suffer with a Alpha release.",1138924800,6,797,4.414965986394558
7988311,2,B00008ZL5K,"What do Greek mythology and 17th-century Scotland have in common?  Absolutely nothing - yet the two are paired together in The Witch's Curse.  It all starts with Martha Gunt, a true crag of a witch burned to death at ye olde stake at the start of the film.  She claims the high and mighty judge is just getting back at her for her refusal to accept any of the woo the guy was pitching to her back when she was young and pretty (and, by the look of her, that must have been about 300 years ago).  Anyway, she puts a curse on the whole town.  A century later, the young women of the village keep going mad and trying to hang themselves off the dead, haunted hanging tree (which bursts forth with blooms whenever a young wench bites the dust).  Then who should come to town but Martha Gunt - on her honeymoon, no less.  This Martha is just an ancestor of the old witch, but that doesn't stop the villagers, ever ready to grab pitchforks and torches, for trying to put her to death for witchcraft.

Then, from out of nowhere, comes Maciste (Kirk Morris).  Remember, this is 17th century Scotland, but Maciste comes strolling up with nothing but a loincloth between his well-oiled muscular body and God.  After getting the innocent girl what amounts to a temporary stay, he pushes over the haunted tree, finds a gateway to hell underneath, and goes down to convince the old witch to release her curse.  Here's what you need to know about Maciste - sure, he's a big strong man, but this guy couldn't pick up a spoon without heaving and straining so badly you'll find yourself reaching for the phone to call the paramedics.  And that's all he does - pick up rocks and trees, rip chains apart, and - on one occasion - power-jump.

It's hard not to call this guy Hercules.  After all, he helps out such Greek mythological characters as Prometheus and that boulder guy while he's in hell, glistens and bulges and dresses like Steve Reeves, and - in some releases of the film - is referred to as Hercules.  Doing a little quick research, I was amazed to discover that this Maciste guy is actually a legendary Italian movie character (did I mention the film was made in Italy?) featured in dozens of films (going all the way back to 1914).  I have to assume some of those other films were better than this one.  Apparently, the guy just shows up anywhere and everywhere, free of any restraint an actual back story would entail, and helps battle evil.  Speaking of 1914, the color of this film is so degraded that it oftentimes looks like one of those early sepia-tone movies that preceded the talkies.",1133481600,4,2589,4.472340425531915
7988312,1,B00008ZL5K,"THE WITCH'S CURSE is one of the worst sword and sandal epics to grace our screens.  The DVD transfer is horrible; the colors are washed out and the sound atrocious.  But even if it had the crystal clarity of a better transfer, the material is so bad, it wouldnt help.  Kirk Morris, one of those hunky 60s bodybuilders, plays Maciste, a muscleman who appears out of nowhere and goes to hell literally to put and end to a witch's curse.  The movie takes place in 16th century Scotland, so what is this Roman gladiator even doing there?  Morris has little dialogue, and he spends most of his time showing off his muscles by lifting trees, moving rocks and ditto ditto.  It isn't even campy enough to be funny.  What a waste of time and effort.",1126828800,2,740,4.437037037037037
