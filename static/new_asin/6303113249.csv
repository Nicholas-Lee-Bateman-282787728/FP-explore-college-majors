7837900,4,6303113249,"Set in a dilapidated property in the Deep South, LAST OF THE MOBILE HOTSHOTS has strong Biblical overtones; it takes place over seven days during a time of incessant rain, culminating in a flood that washes everything away - except one house, that bobs up in the current like Noah's Ark.  This flood occurs on the Day of Judgment, when human beings are either redeemed or damned.  Interspersed with this theme, Tennessee Williams weaves a complex tale of racial transgression, in which the past casts a giant shadow over the present.  There are those who wallow in the past, such as Jeb (James Coburn), without acknowledging its powerful influence; others, such as his half-brother Chicken (Robert Hooks) manage to come to terms with it, even though this acknowledgement only happens right at the end of the film.  Myrtle (Lynn Redgrave) initially appears as someone only concerned with the world of surfaces and consumerism - represented by the new fitted kitchen she wins on a television program - but as the film unfolds, she realizes that personal issues assume far more importance than material wealth.  LAST OF THE MOBILE HOTSHOTS has strong echoes with Williams' earlier work - notably STREETCAR and SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER (Vidal also write the screenplay for this film).  Sometimes the performances become over-strident, but Sidney Lumet's energetic direction holds our attention throughout.",1365811200,2,1397,5.1866666666666665
7837901,3,6303113249,"I collect all films made from Tennessee Williams plays: some show why the play one the Pulitzer; others leave you wondering why they were published:  Last of the Mobile Hot Shots, also known as The Seven Descents of Myrtle, and also Kingdom of Earth. The story is a tragic comedy played primarily by only three actors: Lynn Redgrave, James Coburn, and Robert Hooks. James Coburn is an ailing alcoholic with a desperate legal need for a wife. Lynn Redgrave is the naive woman who falls for the tales of an opulent life in a plantation mansion, who meets him on a couples' game show. Robert Hooks is the other resident of the plantation mansion with whom Lynn Redgrave must contend in order to help her husband in his mysterious legal needs. In the end we discover the shocking secret between the two men, as only Tennessee Williams could have conceived. And the climax is the last minute decision that Lynn Redgrave must make before the levee breaks.
As entertaining as I find it, this is not one of Tennessee Williams' best plays, nor is the film one of the best made. But it is pure Williams camp that grows on you as a comedy.",1358294400,,1128,4.529411764705882
7837902,5,6303113249,"Another great film from Lumet who gave us The Fugitive Kind. No one liked that film and no one liked this one when I saw it in 1969.

It is brutal, brazen and honest as hell. However, this is an ""R"" rated version and this is an ""X"" rated film that has been cut to serve the rating system once more, and to get average buyers to purchase safe sex stuff.

The Last of The Mobile Hot Shots"" had some of the most disturbing images ever filmed by Lumet and they are gone now. What you get is the skeleton, but I hear Criterion, who rescued The Fugitive Kind from the mill of the conventional is very interested in The Last of The Mobile Hot Shots"" and this means a complete version, one hopes.",1326412800,4,688,4.126865671641791
7837903,4,6303113249,"[LAST OF THE MOBILE HOT-SHOTS -(1969)- Widescreen presentation - directed by Sidney Lumet]  As we've come to learn in hindsight, the celebrated works of Tennessee Williams have transitioned to the big screen with varying results, and this film is no exception. The familiar themes of Southern white trash, racial tensions, familial skeletons, class division, backstabbing bigotry and incestuous relationships are all fondly recalled here, making this an odd duck of a film, maybe even a platypus, among the cinematic canon of Williams' plays. This isn't a 'big screen' adaptation like 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'; no, this one's pared down to three eccentric characters stationed in a dilapidated dwelling with all the accommodations of a cave or tree house, and the occupants are scheming malingerers the likes of which you've probably never seen. (And I hope for your sake that this is true). Claustrophobic, anyone?

James Coburn plays the main miscreant, a lecherous lizard in a dirty linen suit who spots wacky Lynn Redgrave on line to get into a local TV game show where contestants are pulled from the audience and given a chance to win prizes. It's a lowbrow, redneck version of 'Let's Make A Deal' minus Monty Hall as host. He follows her inside and sits nearby, and when she's picked to get onstage as part of a couple's competition, she grabs Coburn's hand and drags him up there with her. Moments later, they're in deep - in order to win a houseful of electronic appliances, they must agree to get married right there on the spot during a televised segment. Instead of chewing his hand off at the wrist and hightailing it to a nearby saloon, he submits to the marriage, in spite of the fact that Lynn Redgrave has six kinds of crazy tattooed all over her.

Well, the lucky newlyweds win the appliances, hitch a trailer to his car and drive through a downpour back to Coburn's 'estate', a rundown decrepit mansion with no windows, hot water, electricity, heating or a/c. Lots of filth, though, if that's your thing. Coburn thinks that he and Redgrave will restore the mansion to its once-stately condition and live like land barons in their own Garden of Eden (have I mentioned that he's a highly delusional drunkard?). But the new Adam and Eve have a houseguest, in the form of a half brother, who just happens to be black and has the deed for the property in his back pocket of a pair of pants that haven't been washed since, oh I don't know, ever? And Coburn wants Redgrave to get that deed and deliver it to him by any means necessary. All the while, it's torrential outside and the levee's about to break, just as it has several times in the past, and when it does the only safe place to be is on the roof. Plot-wise, that's all you'll get from me.

As usual, James Coburn is himself, as we like him, just seedier and slimier, but not as Southern-sounding as he should be given the film's roots. Lynn Redgrave, however, is so genuinely Southern, warp-speed wacky and blistering over-the-top she's phenomenal to watch, chewing up every scene she's in, much to my delight. I never knew she could be this good, no, make that magnificent. And Robert Hooks is shrewd and shifty as Coburn's brother (he's much better here than in 'Hurry Sundown'), and sparks do fly in the scenes he does with Redgrave, the chemistry between them is abundant. This time out, Coburn gets almost lost amid the complexity of his co-stars, something I've never witnessed before. They're overpoweringly perverse in their roles and make the film stand up straight, something Gore Vidal's screenplay (whose next script would be 'Myra Breckenridge'- ouch) and even Sidney Lumet's direction couldn't bring to the table intact. The film sways and staggers intoxicated from time to time, buckling under the sheer weight of its characters, their motivations and the knotted back-story that's led to the current crisis while attempting to tie up all loose ends before final credits roll. It succeeds just as often as it fails - this is no 'Dog Day Afternoon' for sure, but it is one helluva train ride over bumpy terrain. To some it may be considered a trainwreck, but I enjoyed it for what it was, not what it wasn't. If you're still reading, you'll probably want to check out these 'Hot Shots' long before the levee breaks. Another interesting addition to the Warner Archive collection.",1311897600,11,4364,4.776158940397351
7837904,5,6303113249,"Saw this at the cinema in 69 and it was like a shot to the heart by way of the gut. Spare and splendid, it is the grand rot of Williams' Old South clinging by its very nails to the last crumb in the quiet before the storm. The cinematography and music caress the dream scape performances of this fine trio of actors as they nail every scene. Its been forty years and I'm still in awe.  Didn't know it was still in print and I'm getting it immediately.",1230854400,4,451,4.067415730337078
7837905,5,6303113249,"This movie is one of my top twentyfive movies.  A movie that polarizes

the audience, and forces each and every one of the audience to explore

our own personal prejudices, and the outright racisim that this film

exposes.

The fans of Tenessee Williams may not agree with the way his story was

related to film.  But does that matter, if the film brings the cancer

of prejudices and racisim to light, in a manner that even the most dull

among us could draw a conclusion, without commiting emotional or mental

battery on the audience.  The film is done in what I would  classify

as a dark comedy, comedy that acts as a vehicle for the message.

James Coburn represents old south, and he doesn't miss a mark or a trick,

he played the roll as a character you could sympathize with on many

levels, without portraying the character as a pathetic relic of the old

south.  While Lynn Redgrave seem to represent those in the middle,

those who's opinion sways in the current of the shifting power struggle,

and she does it in such a delicious white trash affectation, it brought

a wonderful aspect to the film. Robert Hooks, who represents the new

south, is magnificent, bringing all the hope, pain and long suffering

of a long standing family dispute, with a wicked sense of humor and

a sense of what is and what is going to be.

The three main actors all did an excellent acting job, bringing these

characters to life, 3-dimensional, living and breathing life, and getting

the point of the film, which is the message, in a manner that made it

seem that these people lived one plantation over from you.",1175731200,2,1611,4.557894736842106
7837906,4,6303113249,"Well, until ""Not About Nightingales"" makes it to the screen, ""Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots"" will be the last of original, never-before-filmed Tennessee Williams scripts.  Some parts of this movie are so slow, but the images are timeless.  James Coburn descending the stairs in a wedding dress, Lynn Redgrave winning on a TV game show, the flooding of the Mississippi delta are all hard-wired in my mind.  After this 1969 Lumet film, only retreds of older Williams scripts ensue.  Critics of the play ""Kingdom of Earth"" complain that it is so derivative of earlier material that neither the play nor the subsequent film version are sucessful.  I tend to agree with the previous writer from Australia--the movie is subversive in the best sense of the word.  Like the flood, it will creep up on you and change the way you see some things in your life, forever.",1028851200,6,857,4.795918367346939
7837907,5,6303113249,"I loved this film.  I loved the story and the stars and the way out way that it was staged.  I have not read the original play but I felt that this film caught the spirit that is Tennesee Williams not like the mess made of some of his other plays including A Street Car Named Desire.  This film showed the sickness, the desperation and the lies that make up so many lives.  I was so surprised to note that it has been unpopular and I cannot understand why, except that people missed the point.  James Coburn always excellent, was a wonderful pick as the desperate, dying southern aristocrat living on hate and Lyn Redgrave was so loud and so lush that it was important to have a contrast in the half brother.  This was well done and he was not just more of the same. It was in the colour of the film and the tension of the impending death and disaster (which would be first) that the film's tragedy was really felt.",995846400,7,915,4.2298850574712645
7837908,1,6303113249,"Only one of the most dreadful movies ever made, especially considering the big-name talent involved in the production. It's the kind of movie Ed Wood might have made if he'd had any money.",956448000,2,188,4.7272727272727275
