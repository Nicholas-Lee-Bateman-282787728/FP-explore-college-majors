321747,5,6301258746,By far the best concert Gloria & The Miami Sound Machine have ever recorded. Now it's time to put it on DVD!,1218326400,5,108,3.9545454545454546
321748,5,6301258746,"This is Gloria Estefan at the apex of her career. She is gorgeous, sounds great, and is clearly basking in the warm glow of her hometown audience. Like others posting here, I am astonished that this classic performance has not yet found its way to DVD.

I'm ready to start up and sign an on-line petition to get this concert onto DVD!!!!",1216080000,9,337,4.435483870967742
321749,5,6301258746,"I agree to everyone here. This video should be released on DVD. Gloria is so beautiful and energetic along with her fantastic and talented musicians, Miami Sound machine. They were all having fun on stage unlike the rest of her concerts, MSM became her backup band.
I would definitely get one if this would be out on DVD...
I love them.",1215216000,2,336,4.524590163934426
321750,5,6301258746,"This is the concert where I fell in love with Gloria and the MSM.  The music is classic and the performance brings me back to my happy teen years.  I have played the video at least once/week for the last 15 years and it never fails to make me feel good.
Gloria's outfits are very sexy and alot of fun to look at.  From the thigh boots and tight body outfit it to the chaps wearing biker chick look she oozes Sex Appeal.
Hoping some day it'll be on DVD and re-released as a Classic.

321751,5,6301258746,"This is a classic concert. And I agree that it should be released on DVD. ""Words Get in the Way"" performed accousticly with John and Jorge on guitars, ""FANTASTIC"". Or how about Gloria looking ""Caliente"" wearing jeans covered by some leather cowboy stuff. Next year I went to the concert in Rotterdam, but she didn't wear the outfit. Hahahha. Should have asked my money back. No, seriously. This tape is EXCELLENTE (Y CALIENTE?).",1170460800,6,428,4.876712328767123
321752,5,6301258746,"Filmed in 1988 at the Miami Arena, with a sold-out, enthusiastic audience, Gloria Estefan is a marvel in this well-filmed concert from the early days of her incredibly successful career. The musicianship of the Miami Sound Machine is also terrific, and they put on a show that is full of energy and pizzazz. Gloria looks stupendous, with flawless skin and a glorious mane of hair, with 2 skin-tight costume changes, and an electric personality. My favorite piece is the stupendous ""Conga,"" and Gloria dedicates ""Words Get in the Way"" to ""The Ballad King,"" Julio Iglesias, who is in the audience, and takes a bow. There are 2 medleys sung in Spanish, as well as part of ""Anything for You,"" and the rest is sung in English. The guys in the Miami Sound Machine deserve a lot of credit, and they are: Bass: Jorge Casas, keyboards: Clay Ostwald and Jim Trompeter, percussion: Rafael Padilla, trombone: Teddy Mulet, trumpet: Randy Barlow, guitar: John De Farria, sax: Mike Scaglione, and drums: Kiki Garcia. The audio and visual quality is very good, and total running time is 80 minutes.

Song list:

1: ""Hot Summer Nights""

2: ""Bad Boy""

3: ""Surrender Paradise""

4: ""Can't Stay Away from You""

5: ""Let it Loose""

6: Medley: ""Baila Conmigo,"" ""A Toda Maquina,"" ""Dingui-Li-Bangue""

7: ""Falling in Love (Uh-Oh)""

8: ""Words Get in the Way""

9: Medley: ""No Sera Facil,"" ""Me Enamore,"" ""Renacer""

10: ""1-2-3""

11: ""Rhythm is Gonna Get You""

12: ""Conga""

13: ""Betcha Say That""

14: ""Dr. Beat""

321753,5,6301258746,"This is the best of Gloria--this definitely needs to be on DVD.

7810466,5,6301258746,"Without a doubt this is the best concert of the 80's. Gloria, the band, the sound, the freshness of their music and, of course, the people of Miami in the audience living a great party. All songs arranged in an amazing way only to be improved.

7810469,5,6301258746,I never been to a gloria estefan concert and I never really knew that much about her. One night I was flipping the channels on cable and came across this concert at first I wasn't very interested but something told me to keep watching and soon recognized some of the songs so I kept watching and shortly became hooked the next time it came on cable I even taped it. I was worried that as soon as the tape was worn out it would be impossible to find again. Since I have been converting over to dvd I discovered somewhere along the line I through the tape away I was heart broken and thougth there was no way I would find it. I am still wondering why this concert is not on dvd yet I am sure there are others who feel the same way. All i know is if I found this concert on dvd I would buy it in a minute. I cant thank the seller enough this is one concert I thought I would never find again,1281139200,2,888,3.938888888888889
