6446002,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"Just when you think Prisoner Of War cannot get any better this series amazes you with its intricate script, real acting, and great directing. The actors who play the characters in this series bring them to life. They seem so real that you cannot stop thinking about their life and what is going to happen. You really develop a love for them as human beings. This series is unique in the way it weaves interconnected elements such as intrigue and suspense with character development. Prisoner Of War gives you and inside view of what it's like to be a POW, how difficult it is for these solders to adjust to the changing world they left behind and what life is like for all the people who live in this area. War is a way of life.",1420329600,5,728,4.360294117647059
6446003,5,B00KTFJ6VK,Excellent series.  Much better than Homeland.  In depth character development of both the prisoners themselves and the loved ones left behind who were forced to endure during their absence.,1419811200,3,189,5.482758620689655

6446008,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"Brilliant T.V. Just observing the subtle variations in plot and theme between this and it's remake, Homeland, is worth the time. But in its own right this show is much better, much grittier and much more informative. This is probably the only Israeli T.V. show I have ever seen and it is fully informative about  the state of consciousness ""on the ground"" in that country. The people, the difficulties, the way of life seem to be beautifully shown. Very informative, moving and altogether spellbinding. A+++",1418947200,15,507,4.964705882352941

6446011,5,B00KTFJ6VK,We think this is a very outstanding series,1474416000,,42,4.375
6446012,4,B00KTFJ6VK,"A story of three PoW turned a very special direction as a Jew-cum-a-jihadist-commander changes sides once again and is being rescued by an Israeli superman-commando annihilating a dozen of terrorists-fighters, bringing about a saved man with his Palestinian boy-in-care into Eretz.

From my viewpoint, this rather a fantastic story triggers much broad questions than of mere hostile affairs Semitic cousins-Jews and Arabs-exercise during a history recorded.

As understood, no TV show continuation was to date produced and, as such, I turn my attention to the American remake ""Homeland"", bearing possible significant differences from an Israeli original in mind.",1474243200,,662,5.744897959183674
6446013,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"The video quality of Season 2 is much better than the smeared out Season 1.  Season 2 looks like and is written like a real Hollywood show.
Because it was originally a television show, the flashbacks happen just a bit too often for serial watchers, but that's a tolerable objection.
Surprised Yael Eitan (Dana in the show) didn't make more of an international career as a highly talent actress.",1469232000,,394,4.7101449275362315
6446014,5,B00KTFJ6VK,Awesomely played and really poignant story line. Really heady vs simply action plot that deals with some very important societal implications of these issues.,1466985600,,158,5.625
6446015,3,B00KTFJ6VK,"This is one of the best television programs I have ever seen.  It is far more impressive than the American Homeland.  However, the quality of the video on the Second Season discs is very poor.  The pixelization is very apparent.  This was not an issue with the season 1 disks I got from Netflix, but on these discs purchased from Amazon the quality is extremely poor.  The show is available on Hulu.  That might be a better way to go.",1455062400,4,434,4.3625

6446019,5,B00KTFJ6VK,One of the best series by far that I have watched. I am looking forward to another season. I watched the entire season in one sitting.  I couldn't wait to see what happened next!,1447632000,,178,4.235294117647059

6446023,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"So glad I had season 2 on hand to start viewing immediately after the stunning first season finale.  What a blockbuster!
The second season twists the story in a different direction switching scenes from Damascus and Jerusalem as it ultimately merges with the prisoners of war for a riveting wild ride.  I also really liked the ""sequence""s that were interspersed with the story where Gideon gives us info on the actors, the staging of some of the intense scenes, and other background information.  This series exceeded my expectations- can't wait for Gideon start filming season 3.",1443139200,3,580,5.020833333333333

Very talented good scripture. Kept me on the edge  of my seat through all seasons.",1438387200,,197,5.09375
6446026,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"Homeland was great - but it is like a ""walk in the park"" compared to this Israeli series.
Prisoners of War is not for the faint-hearted because it's much too powerful and suspenseful. Keeps you guessing every minute what's going to happen next. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, you find out you were wrong!
Season 1 was great (mainly character development) and Season 2 exceeded all expectations (mainly suspense thriller). Sure hope there's going to be a Season 3.",1433980800,4,483,4.761904761904762
6446027,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"Although,it certainly makes,the Palestinians among the worst torturers, and thus is a powerful propaganda piece against them, the revealations of Israeli duplicity and hard heartedness are not absent.  The family and personal reactions are plausible, the complex effects believable.  Not one actor is less than perfect.  On balance, it is impossible not,to,sympathize with the tortured and hate the torturers even though morally a balance is struck.",1431993600,6,449,5.7727272727272725

6446029,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"Easily flowed into season 2 from the first season. Because of the subtitles, sometimes hard to follow. Expect some things were lost in the nuances of the language and the English translation. Same holds true for season 1. The ending was not all that fulfilling for me. All in all a fine series.",1424649600,2,294,4.566037735849057

8661330,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"* Spoiler Alert *

I loved this series. BUT, I am conflicted about the season 2 finale. The rescue of Ami was lame. Two soldiers are held kidnapped and tortured for 17 years, but one commando can be captured, get away, kill all of the bad guys, and escape back home with two others. All in one day. Gimme a break. But then at the end of the last episode, Haim ponders the thought that perhaps it was all too easy. And then dismisses it and the season ends. Unfortunately they never made a season 3. Is it possible that the rescue was a setup?? Maybe it really was too easy?? Maybe it wasn't lame?? Isn't that what Haim was hinting at?? So then maybe Ami was being set up as a sleeper agent in Israel??",1533427200,,701,4.154411764705882

8661334,5,B00KTFJ6VK,"So much better than the American version Homeland. This is made for Israel and their particular issues, the fact that such a small country knows the families of those held captive. This is character driven and family driven, how POW's never leave captivity even when they leave and neither do their families. Also fascinating, how Israeli agencies are on the case even after release, following, questioning, always wary of their security and the ""patriotism"" of the released soldiers. Are they still Israelis or have they been turned",1483920000,,533,5.137931034482759
