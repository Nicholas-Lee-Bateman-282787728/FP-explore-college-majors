2249008,5,B0007XT7OA,Here is a very informative and amusing documentary with a cause. Woody Harrelson is the man!,1232841600,4,92,4.8125
2249009,5,B0007XT7OA,"This is a fantastic and inspiring movie. The people in it are relateable, the music is great, and the message is timeless. It is funny, but not cheesy, the message is vocalized but not preachy. Ron Mann is a great director who made a motivating and inspirational movie. And in response to one reviewer calling it a spoof, it is not. I am a member of the Ruckus Society and they are a %100 legitimate organization with real activist training camps. In short, everyone needs to see Go Further.",1214352000,7,491,4.52808988764045
2249010,1,B0007XT7OA,"This movie is a spoof -- he is the enviro hippy, yoga, organic Borat . Read why! It was insulting.

The multiple long scenes of them hold hands at the ocean were suppose to be funny + they were all the same.  The bike riding footage is sporadic and inconstant with the timeline (trip map).  They coincidentally met all these wacky people with fake projects --  a worm farmer that showed them a home video of a beach trip? --an activist training camp?

They were smoking pot and always had pot hanging in the back ground (as a Joke!).  The Raw food was a setup for the non-converted to joke about.  The meal was not all raw food.

My favorite was the constant fake take of logging trucks.  In one scene two logging trucks with the exact same types of trees pass each other honking (going in opposite directions). This does not happen -- they don't deliver trees to a clear cut.

The same people were in many scenes!!!!!!  Extras!!!!!

This movie is a dumb spoof.  Everything.  They were not even riding half the time.
There were no facts about anything -- the spoof that these people know nothing.",1191196800,2,1096,4.442211055276382
2249011,4,B0007XT7OA,"This movie is for the every day Joe and Josie who are more concerned with putting food on the table for their families, rather than if it was microbiotic.  Its not a get on your soap box movie, its a ""this is a journey we took with like-minded folk telling our personal truths"".  They offered up the menu with ease and grace.

The real heros of the journey were not the attendees, but rather those folks they met along their journey at the side of the road.  There were the individual farms, whether it be food or worm farms doing their thing in the manner that made their hearts sing.  Yes, they had stereotypical teen drug users they met up with for a few moments and a lot too much of a two-faced sexiest named steve, small ""s"" intended.

The movie is worth your time and the message is worth all of our efforts.  This coach potato might just get up early and go to the Saturday Farmer's Market in Eugene tomorrow.",1186099200,5,917,4.296511627906977
2249012,5,B0007XT7OA,"After reading reviews on Amazon about this movie I was prepared to be disappointed.  This is hands down the best movie I have seen that tries to put an entire organic way of living into a holistic framework.  I have been disappointed in the past where people implement sustainable living in one area of their life but not others. For example I see raw foodists travel all over using fossil fuels and live in large houses. Also there are many good one issue movies such as the movie Blue Vinyl which I loved but the director was overweight and I don't know if she got the rest of the sustainable picture with regard to eating right, being close to nature, and using Yoga and meditation. There are many single issue movies and books out there looking at Biodiesel, sustainable agriculture, raw foods,green building and Yoga, but there is not one that puts them all together as well as this film.

What I really love about this movie is that it is upbeat, positive, and the poem at the end by Woody is worth the price alone.  Also, don't miss the extras where there is a speech by Julia Hill Butterfly that is awesome.",1124668800,20,1115,4.477832512315271
2249013,5,B0007XT7OA,"For a fat carnivore like myself, I found this exremely motivating.  It isn't preachy.  It isn't super political.  It's just some basic truths and ideas presented.  I've always been pretty ignorant about environmental things and didn't have the will power to want to change my eating habits.  I loved the way this was presented.  The musical presentations were great too.  You should check out the website if the movie did anything for you.",1120089600,27,439,4.931506849315069
2249014,3,B0007XT7OA,"Unfortunately, in this case the medium drowns out the message.  Ostensibly the story of Woody Harrelson's bio-organic powered bus trip/college speaking tour of the West Coast to promote ""environmental awareness"" and ""simple organic living,"" this documentary is, unfortunately, less about that than about the consciousness-raising transformation of a corn-pone eating, mentally challenged hayseed named ""Steve Clark.""  Why producer-director Ron Mann chose a sexist, junk food and cigarette addicted dimwitted ""everyman"" to be the centerpiece of this movie escapes me. Although, I suppose that was the point.  If so, yeech.  I assure you, a very little of ""Steve Clark"" goes a long way.

The real lameness in this movie only becomes abundantly clear once one views the ""special features"" and ""deleted scenes"" which are far more interesting that watching ""Steve"" ogle a ""chick"" or shout through a megaphone exulting in his conversion to a new healthy life style (urp...).  The real problem is that the movie seems edited for maximum ""Steve"" camera time (with the attendant bumps and bruises of bicyclist's life on the road) and only incidentally about environmentalism and alternatives to mass consumer culture.  Which is to say, the best moments are found in the deleted scenes; for instance, a beautiful and haunting song by Dave Matthews and his quite thoughtful discourse on the current state of American mass media as a distorted misrepresentation of ""reality;"" Woody Harrelson's ""poem"" is likewise an ""extra"" as are much of the lectures and q&a of his campus crusade.  So when one looks at the entire package it becomes apparent that less ""Steve"" and more relevant and intelligent material would have perhaps made this movie a tad more didactic, but certainly more interesting.

On the up side, the movie does have the last recorded images of the late, great writer and counter-culture guru Ken Kesey, and a lecture by former cattle rancher turned activist Howard Lyman who in no uncertain terms delineates the source of the feed that results in cannibal cow madness (which must, one assumes, have some affect on voracious dead cow eaters).

All in all, a mixed effort whose best moments were left on the editing room floor.",1119225600,12,2227,5.195530726256983
2249015,2,B0007XT7OA,"This film basically consists of keeping Woody Harrelson company as he rages against the machine. And while this is not useless or a waste of time, it does not make for good cinema. Besides technical problems such as bad sound and lighting, these people do a poor job of getting their point across. They really do little more than scaremonger and whitewash.  To me yelling that every glass of milk has blood and pus in it is just as counteractive as D.A.R.E telling kids that all drugs will destroy their lives, in that once that lie is exposed you lose all credibility with your audience. When I watch an excellent documentary, say ""Fahrenheit 9-11,"" I get two things that were lacking in this film, boiling blood and answers to questions that would come from the other side. For example, in this film why couldn't they answer why we are living longer than ever if all we are eating is blood, pus, and pesticides? Or, why is it okay to take drugs that were created in a laboratory, but not food that was created there? And it wouldn't have killed them to poke one of two holes in their theory, just to keep things real. I simply did not believe that every person they ran into were dying to eat their organic food, and that once they did they all loved it, got clear skin, and became sexual maniacs. As a liberal I was disappointed to see them poorly using tactics that I associate with the right in this country (once again: scaremongering and whitewashing). That said, millions of people tune into Bill O'Reilly every night and all he does is sit in an office. At least Harrelson and company rode a bike across the country to get your attention. I enjoyed the scene when they ran into Sharon because to me she represented the current state of the American mind (""Were not at crisis as long as I choose not to see it.""). I also thought the training ground for protestors was fun and informative. Also, it is obvious to me that one day hanging out with these people and I would lose all my liberal street cred.  I like my dairy and chocolate and meat. Yes I know big corporations are usually evil (especially Monsanto), but the food companies make it so that people in this country can eat. From where I'm sitting that is a lot less evil than. . .oh say. . .locking your employees in the store after hours and union busting.  Still, for the most part the trip is dull and preachy. The film would have been better served with more statistics and less megaphone. 2.5 out of 5.",1119052800,3,2474,4.4449339207048455
2249016,3,B0007XT7OA,"Woody Harrelson travels down the West Coast in a huge but environmentally friendly RV spreading the mesage of ""walking lightly on the planet"" and using all things hemp.

Kind of amateurish and boring, and very 60s (I almost expected Peter Fonda to ride by on his monkey barred hog tripped out as Captain America). The somewhat unfocused message is further muted with a gaggle of hangers on, including a scene hogging idiot who is also a junk food addict who has nothing to say and says it constantly.  My favorite was the cute vegan chef and her mix or radical food types.  Seaweed slushie anyone?

The filmmaking by Ron Mann is unimaginative. It reeks (no pun intended) of a too long, stoner, home movie.

The basic message by Harrelson is worthy of a bolder, more focused movie that backs up its message with visual proof of the argument.  Stopping by to chat with radical 60s icon Ken Kesey is not nearly enough.

A bizarre vanity production by an eccentric, rich guy with an earthy message that is lost in the telling.",1114041600,5,1022,4.613259668508287

What I got
- No outtakes, intervews or additional performances
- No excerpt from Wormania!
- No special pull-out insert
- The movie
- The Original Theatrical Trailer
-Trailers for a few other movies
- A menu item that gives me info about mongrel media

This makes me sorry with my rice.  The entire reason I purchased the DVD rather than just streaming it was for the included extras.  The DVD I got has a different cover than the one above, and is released by mongrel media rather than home vision entertainment.  It's totally not worth the effort to return it for less than $10, and the seller is not really at fault, but I did not get the item I ordered.",1448409600,,923,4.773584905660377
8053663,3,B0007XT7OA,"Good movie, especially for Woody Harrelson fans.",1436486400,,48,6.0
8053664,2,B0007XT7OA,"Should have a trailer. This is about Woody's attempt to recreate the Magic Bus tour with his entourage while doing speeches for his cause at various learning institutions. His cause is living naturally and sustainably, and how corporate america is taking over and that we need to fight this. His positions on these issues often seem oversimplified, without going into detail how we can make these things work from a practical standpoint. The journey isn't all that compelling, either. Might be worth watching if it was included as a Prime offering.",1426464000,,548,5.032967032967033
8053665,2,B0007XT7OA,"I love Woody Harrelson. I saw the movie ""Ethos"" and have read about him in Veg times mag. I love his message on animal rights and environmentalism. I though this movie would give personal insights into what precipitated his vegan lifestyle and how it has changed him etc. I was really disappointed. This movie is basically watching a group of people ride a bus. When they would get to a place where he was going to speak they would stop tape as soon as Woodey got on stage and bring you back to the bus. If I hadn't already heard him speak on the internet I would only have a vague idea what his passions were by the movie alone. I bought the book as well so maybe that will be more of what I was looking for.",1400371200,,709,4.144927536231884
8053666,2,B0007XT7OA,"It seemed like this movie was about their adventure down the pacific coast, rather than the issues that the tour was about.  I would have liked to see more about their speeches and interactions with the public along the way.  What was this movie even about?  Pretty disappointing.",1377734400,,280,4.791666666666667
8053667,5,B0007XT7OA,"This should be required material in our school systems.  As a nation we need to focus on our impact on the environment and the changes we can make.  Like most effective learning, Go Farther prompted me to do additional research.",1366761600,,228,4.675

8053669,5,B0007XT7OA,"This documentary of Woody's road trip is a good introduction to the many environmental problems we face. I hope it encouraged people to investigate further.
It's unfortunate the movie spent so much time documenting Steve's transformation. Steve went from a junk food eating douche to an organic, raw food eating douche.",1255132800,2,319,5.2745098039215685
