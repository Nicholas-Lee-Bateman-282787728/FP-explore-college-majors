From fighting a girl with sticks of bread, to spraying water hoses on people she was a pretty funny character. I think the other female character said it best ""She is an idiot but very very fun"". Spliced in between watching Akemi (I think that's how her name went)there's sex thrown in there. Awkward because it boarders between sad to funny to pathetic in some scenes like with the hair dryers to the scene where she gets beat up for money. It kind of just make you question why are you watching this? I can only guess like in typical Japanese fashion this is supposed to be weird and confusing. The end made me laugh even (there's a dance scene) if you watch in the background you can see a little boy punching one of the actors in the stomach it's funny because I don't think it was in the script.

I'm not a fan of these ""pink films"" only one I ever saw that was note worthy ""man woman and the wall"". I would have enjoyed this better if they removed the sex stuff made it 45 minutes longer and turned it into a comedy/drama type of film. I thought the acting was good enough for this type of film it seemed to fit right in with the rest of it.",1306454400,2,1216,4.196581196581197
8216731,1,B000V6LT4E,"Do you like to make fun of Art Films? Then do I have a doozy for you. This Japanese ""Pink Film"" called ""Frog Song"" is an incomprehensible mess involving unfaithful boyfriends, a manga artist doubling as a hooker, the wife of the unfaithful boyfriend who runs around in a giant frog suit. There's sex, SM, hints of lesbianism, and for no apparent reason, a song and dance encore.

With all the visual aesthetics of a college film project and some of the most un-arousing sex ever forced onto DVD, ""Frog Song"" would be a Mystery Science Theater natural if it was in English. It was over in just more than one hour and I felt like I had been trapped for the entire day. I can't even emphasize how awful this is...from the women fighting with bread-sticks to the creepy SM actors dancing with the frog suited characther in the finale, this is even worse than your hipster buddy's entire DVD library's worst moments compilation.",1241136000,,923,4.593939393939394
