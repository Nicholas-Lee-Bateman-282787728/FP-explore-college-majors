8323765,5,6304349637,"This video may be low budget, but that is part of the charm for me. I was still very overweight a year after I had my first child, so I bought this video and the Workout with Baby video that goes with it. I lost 40 pounds in a month and a half using this video at least once a day. It was like working out with seriously non-judgemental friends. When the workout provided was no longer sufficient by itself, I started jogging and swimming with my child as well.

  I have another child now and a plethora of workout tapes, dvds, a health club membership, and yet I find myself drawn to working out with this friendly group once again.",1134604800,2,634,4.223140495867769
