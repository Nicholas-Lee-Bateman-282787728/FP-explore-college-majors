8665415,3,B00LEK4E34,"I picked this movie up the other night without ever having heard of it before based on the box and the description.  I was expecting a martial arts/kung fu style movie.  ""Game of Assassins"" is nothing like that!  It is a movie about a group of people thrown into a prison/dungeon and the bulk of the movie is them trying to figure out why they are there in the first place and how to get out.  I won't give any spoilers, but it is a fine movie for what it is, it is just very different from what I expected it to be looking at the box/synopsis.  There is some action, but the focus is on mystery/trying to solve puzzles.

Parental guide: It has: language, satanic imagery, some violent death scenes, It doesn't have: nudity/sex, alcohol/drug use",1424908800,4,745,4.401459854014599
8665416,5,B00LEK4E34,"I bought the electronic version of movie and watch it a few times. Well acting and directing, the things I like about movie is it keeps you in dark and makes you continue to watch to the end.",1413331200,,191,4.052631578947368
8665417,4,B00LEK4E34,"Have you ever seen a movie cover that caught your eye, so you picked it up, read the back, and thought, Hm, sounds interesting.  You take the movie home and throw it in the player, but once it starts, you quickly realize the cover and the description don't have much to do with the actual film you're watching.  Ive run across this several times over the years, and it never fails to make me roll my eyes.  I can only assume the person in charge of promoting the film didn't actually watch it before they decided to market it.  Such is the case with GAME OF ASSASSINS.  While the description does tell a bit of the plot, the cover (and the title, for that matter) makes no sense.

Even so, the film is well done and entertaining, therefore I am not giving it a bad review.  However, I do feel I have to be honest in my reviews, which is why I tell you things like this.  Theres nothing worse than paying money for something, only to find out its not what you thought it was.

Now that Ive gotten my rant out of the way, I will start off the review by stating I really enjoyed this film once I disregarded the cover and title.  It is a slick little thriller chocked full of intensity and an intriguing plot.

GAME OF ASSASSINS is shot well and looks good onscreen.  I particularly like the dark, almost Gothic nature of the sets.  They help set a very eerie and unsettling tone for the movie, which in turn draws the viewer deeper into each scene.

The acting is pretty good as well.  I always enjoy seeing Bai Ling onscreen, and this time shes joined by Dustin Nguyen, Warren Kole, and Jaime Ray Newman.  While no breakout performances can be noted, the whole cast does a good job in their roles.

The plot of GAME OF ASSASSINS is what wins me over here, though.  I like the mystery that unfolds as the group ventures deeper into their prison.  And when the big reveal comes at the end, it does not disappoint.  Overall, this is a satisfying movie experience.

GAME OF ASSASSINS is a tension-filled gauntlet that pleases on several levels.  I recommend giving this little gem a look; just disregard the artwork on the DVD cover (it literally has nothing to do with the film).  The movie is available now in a variety of formats.",1413158400,4,2228,4.354368932038835
8665418,4,B00LEK4E34,"Five stars for Bai Ling, well, it's Bai Ling, enough said,  Minus 1 star for the rest of the cast, B rate actors..  But all in all a nice performance from Bai Ling, Luv her.",1412380800,3,173,3.914285714285714
8665419,1,B00LEK4E34,Just horrible,1412208000,,13,6.0
8665420,3,B00LEK4E34,"David (Warren Kole) who is a Boston cop awakens in place that is a bit like purgatory. He is joined by other people, Jin (Dustin Nguyen) Emma (Jaime Ray Newman) Tyler (Nick Lane) , Anna (Murielle Telio) and Kim Lee (Bai Ling) who provides us with token eye candy.

If you read the title, you know they all have something in common. The film is a bit like ""Cube"" as they must solve a puzzle to go on to the next level. The film has religious overtones, but is not a religious film. Has a couple of good scenes, no great ones. The drama felt like a reality TV show when they eliminate someone. It was a bit fake.

The acting was what would expect for such a film. Warren Cole, the main character was a bit dry.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",1411776000,,752,4.172413793103448
