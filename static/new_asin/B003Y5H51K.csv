4220435,4,B003Y5H51K,"Based on a real life, near death caving experience, Sanctum is a thriller that squeezes claustrophobic audiences into tight, dark spaces, and forces all viewers to imagine and evaluate their personal fortitude if put in a precarious situation.

Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh), a professional cave diver compared to Jacques Cousteau and Neil Armstrong, is on a caving/cave-diving expedition with his highly trained team and his mercurial son Josh (Rhys Wakefield).  Exploring the Esaala Caves in Papua New Guinea, the team has to traverse thousands of meters of virgin caves in order to ultimately find a connection to the sea.  The eccentric financier, Carl (Ioan Gruffudd), with experience sky diving, caving, and cave diving, stalag-might have a problem with an imminent typhoon that threatens the expedition.  The team is in over their heads when Mother Nature expedites the timeline; and they must navigate an underwater labyrinth in order to survive.

Similar to a real surfer watching Point Break, a rock climber watching Cliffhanger, or a skydiver watching...Point Break, there are plenty of technicalities to nitpick.  The point, however, is entertainment, not a documentary.  While utterly predictable during most moments, the movie nonetheless whitens knuckles and squeezes air from lungs.  Beautifully rendered and lit, the cinematography had to naturally extend a little creative license in order to capture some of the brilliant underwater scenes.  Particularly thrilling were the wide-angle cave diving shots and the crystal clear caverns.  If pristine, unexplored worlds, alien to the average human eye were intended, then kudos are warranted.

While I enjoyed the script (regardless of predictability), the dialogue was weak at times.  The worst moment was during a particularly harrowing moment, when water was flooding a portion of the cave system, young Josh declares to his father, ""The cave is flooding.""  Department of Redundancy Department calling.  The lines not withstanding, the emotional stress on the key players is appropriate but tired.  Of course the father and son butt heads.  Yep, the son transforms during the film and accepts responsibility.  Does someone make an honorable sacrifice to aid the team?  Guaranteed.  I suppose some spokes are necessary for the wheel.

Ultimately I enjoyed Sanctum.  As a scuba diver the underwater scenes excited me, but I'm quite sure avid cave divers won't be using in for PR purposes.

4220436,3,B003Y5H51K,"The biggest, deepest cave in the world, lots of water, rumblings, a cyclone up above--danger and perils everywhere. If you are claustrophobic, fear tight underground spaces and being breathless under water, and if you fear clich&eacute;s and stereotypes, it might be well if you avoid ""Sanctum."" If you're short of cash, you may not want to pay a premium to see this epic in 3D (It's also available in 2D).
 This is almost one of those ""And Then There Were None"" sagas, because characters are drowning very regularly in this one. There is a classic battle going on between a strong-willed father and an equally determined son. The stubborn, tyrannical father has spent his adult life exploring caves with great danger to himself and to those around him. He's a cold-blooded, some would call a maniacal spelunker. Cave exploration, it seems, involves mountain-climbing skills, underwater diving, toying with death, and conflict-management.
 Of course in such an endeavor you have to have an ambitious, willful, selfish, risk-taking villain who defies orders, is nasty and puts others at risk. For most of the 109 minutes of movie running time, you are in these caves that are lit well enough to see the actors, and it's bright enough to see them get knocked off. There are no creatures down there to threaten them which may put off some animal enthusiasts in the audience.
 The actors all do a credible job, but I never heard of any of them. James Cameron was executive producer, but it doesn't look as if he played a very active part in the creative end of the production. The special effects are not particularly noteworthy.
 There's excitement, suspense, and you can't help becoming involved, but somehow it lacks that creative spark that's needed. It's non-stop action which younger viewers liked. One thing I discovered about 3D movies. Look at them without the glasses and the picture is brighter, the colors are sharper.",1297468800,17,1926,4.953560371517028
4220437,5,B003Y5H51K,"Great entertainment. All the things that can go wrong in a cave. Flooding, hair getting stuck on descender/stuck on a water fall ascent/ rope cut, panic, out of air, last resort radical rescue techniques, equipment failure, fall, rock fall, back up taken for granted, failure to listen to reason, etc. Lights are the lifeline in caving just like air for scuba.
This is as hardcore caving can get. Key there was to evacuate early. Ego and panic kills in this environment. Exlploration push fever is  like having the summit fever. This is a cavers dream without  murphy. Too bad for the tragedy. Great diving movie just like the Abyss and Le Grand Bleu.

4220439,2,B003Y5H51K,"""Sanctum"" exemplifies what happens when innovation becomes more important than a screenplay. The story is contrived, calculating, and unpleasant, but never fear - James Cameron is the executive producer, and he will see to it that we gawk helplessly at the difficult camerawork, the authentically claustrophobic sets, and the 3D effects. Perhaps it was his intention for director Alister Grierson to experience his own private version of ""The Abyss,"" a technological breakthrough that came at the expense of a notoriously difficult shoot. The only difference is that, this time around, the needless suffering is reflected in the finished film, which tells a story so bleak and simple-minded that it's an insult to audiences, especially the ones that paid extra for the 3D glasses.

It's said to be based on a true story, but considering the way the plot unfolds, I can't help but take that claim with a grain of salt. It depicts an ill-fated scuba-diving expedition in Papua New Guinea's Esa-ala, a vast network of underground caves; the plan was to surpass a base camp deep beneath the surface and continue further in, but things take a turn for the worst when a massive storm floods the cave's opening and traps the people within. According to the team leader, Frank (Richard Roxburgh), it's merely a matter of finding an underground river and following its current, for all rivers flow towards the sea. He would, of course, say something like that, for he understands caves far better than the mind-numbing routine of CDs, mortgages, and fatherhood.

I've admitted in the past that I don't understand the thought processes of mountain climbers and thrill seekers. But movies about such people are usually made in such a way that we, the audience, can somehow respond to the unexplainable lure of nature. The best current example is ""127 Hours""; even with James Franco's arm pinned between a dislodged bolder and a canyon wall, director Danny Boyle had the decency to explore the simplistic beauty of Blue John Canyon, to show the rock formations bathed in sunlight. Compare this to ""Sanctum,"" which takes place almost entirely within the confines of cramped, desolate, dark, waterlogged caves. Such locations fail to inspire a sense of awe. Because of this, it's virtually impossible to sympathize with any of the characters.

Not that they were well developed in the first place. Their primary function is to spew inane dialogue before displaying many of the ways in which a person can die in a scuba expedition. By the end of the movie, we will have seen examples of the bends, hypothermia, broken bones, and drowning - which, I'm sorry to say, isn't always an accidental occurrence. One of the characters, the girlfriend of the expedition's financier, is inexperienced as both a scuba diver and a mountain climber, and that sort of makes me wonder why she was allowed to join in the first place. She, along with just about everyone else, is as disposable as a teenager in a slasher film, and about as authentically written.

The only two characters that matter are Frank and his son, Josh (Rhys Wakefield). The more scenes they share, the more obvious it becomes that ""Sanctum"" was manufactured strictly for the purposes of watching them reconnect. They have never gotten along; Frank is an explorer who hears only to the call of the wild, and Josh has been forced to partake. But they have more in common than it might first appear, a revelation that pretty much exists only in movies like this. They will eventually find themselves in a commonplace survival scenario, one that involves someone who has gone mad out of desperation to escape. I'd expect this kind of thing from a western or a horror movie, but not from a man-against-nature drama.

Although not credited as one of the writers, I have an uneasy feeling that James Cameron contributed to the screenplay. Let me make it clear that I've always championed him as a filmmaker and storyteller, and that includes his latest effort, the monumentally successful ""Avatar."" But now, I feel I must admit that, in one key area, he has consistently disappointed me: The man has a tin ear for dialogue. With ""Aliens,"" ""The Abyss,"" ""Titanic,"" and now with ""Sanctum,"" there is not a single line that sounds like something a person would actually say. You know something is wrong when the only way to counteract the effects of a bad scene is to overcompensate with foul language, which flows freely in just about every scene. This is a surprisingly bad movie, something that doesn't deserve the name of James Cameron.",1296777600,,4571,4.91580310880829
4220440,1,B003Y5H51K,"Sanctum certainly seems to have a lot of potential, doesn't it? It was filmed in 3D and produced by Avatar director James Cameron. Even if you're like me and not completely sold by the TV spots and trailers, it's bound to be decent because Cameron is somewhat involved, right? Keep telling yourself that. Sanctum is probably the most disappointing theatrical experience in the first few months of the year.

You'll probably notice how fantastic the film looks. Sanctum was obviously filmed in 3D and uses the same techniques Cameron used for Avatar, which also isn't surprising. Nearly everything seems to jump off the screen, but at the same time the film doesn't really have any standout moments where the effect is utilized in a way that really wows its audience. Most of the underwater scenes are spectacular though. Seeing those vast underwater cavities, even if they were probably mostly created in front of a green screen, is incredible. There are also several scenes where you're looking at the giant hole in the earth the main characters first enter as if you were looking down from the sky while it's raining that are really memorable because of the perspective. So at face value, Sanctum has the appearance of a good film or at least a decent one.

Nearly everything else about the film is awful. You know things are going to go downhill once Josh mutters the line, ""What could possibly go wrong in a cave?"" Everyone in the film just makes terrible decisions from then on out. Remember that thing that happened last time? Let's make it a point to mention that, so it won't happen again. Sure enough, it happens again. DON'T do whatever you're thinking about doing. I know it's a drastic situation and you have to think on your toes, but you will surely die if you do what you're thinking of doing. So what does the person do? That thing they were advised not to. So guess what happens? Josh and Victoria are probably the worst of them. Josh points out the stupidest of observations. When the cave first starts to flood, he's in the team heading to the surface but decides to go back for his dad and the others still down in the cave. The cave is flooding. Water is pouring in. It's very obvious what's happening. So Josh runs in, around rocks, all out of breath and calling out to his dad. When he reaches the cave entrance, he yells out the brilliant statement that, ""THE CAVE IS FLOODING!"" Gee, you think? Victoria does something in the film that is incredibly stupid and you know it is right when she does it, then later looks back on it realizing she should have done what she was advised to do in the first place. Do you want to defile a dead woman's corpse or develop hypothermia and freeze to death? The answer should be obvious. The rest of the characters aren't so great either though. Josh's dad, Frank, is basically emotionless and nothing more than an Australian version of Christian Bale's Batman while Ioan Gruffudd's Carl is the typical selfish character that makes a lot of over the top decisions that never pay off.

Throw in the lame attempts at humor and terrible dialogue and you have yourself an hour and forty nine minute groanfest. Carl mentions something about Frank's anus being so tight that a dog won't be able to hear him fart while Crazy George spews nothing but bad jokes and even worse dialogue the entire film. Developing the clap in Mexico along with advising to grow gills if your equipment goes faulty and telling someone to calm down because the ""panic vulture sits on your shoulder"" are all things that are memorable for all the wrong reasons.

Some of the tight spaces traveled through while underwater were able to trigger my claustrophobia at times, but it was nothing that hadn't been done better before. Remember The Descent? Most of me was wanting Crawlers to show up and kill everyone in this horrible film after it was established that every character had been dropped on their head at some point in their childhood. The other part of me was wondering why this pushed for an R-rating. Other than a few brief moments of gore and the F-bomb being dropped a few dozen times, the film could've easily been edited down to a PG-13 rating to appeal to a wider audience. Then again, with Cameron's name slapped onto the film and the main marketing ploy, maybe a PG-13 film that mostly takes place underwater would remind too many people of Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss and make them think it was a remake or something. Well, let me tell you, this doesn't come anywhere close to even touching The Abyss.

Sanctum is a dull, predictable, and cliche thriller with terrible dialogue, a lame attempt at humor, some of the dumbest characters to ever be included in a film, and just a rather underwhelming journey in the end. Don't go into this expecting it to be another Avatar just because Cameron is connected to the film in some way or because it was filmed in 3D. Don't even expect a good film. If you have any interest in Sanctum, I recommend waiting for the rental because it really isn't worth paying expensive movie theater ticket prices in addition to whatever you have to pay for 3D films.",1296777600,16,5142,4.627601314348302

4220920,5,B003Y5H51K,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  There was a lot of panic, and a lack of leadership and teamwork among the crew of around eight people whom were trapped in an underground cave when a tropical storm arrived earlier than expected, cutting off their only access route to the cave.  The only way out, was to journey to the ocean.  But most of that journey was through an unchartered underwater labyrinth.  The movie made me realize that respect for nature, as well as for other team members, is needed in order to survive.",1404691200,,544,4.41
4220921,5,B003Y5H51K,I just loved the suspense  and constant action packed all the way through the whole movie kept me on my toes.  Thank you very much.,1404172800,,131,4.2
4220922,4,B003Y5H51K,"I watched this streaming on Amazon just last night. I thought I would just have something on in the background while I cooked dinner but I soon got engrossed and had to sit down and give it my full attention. So why did I like it and so many other not like it?

For one thing, I consider myself somewhat of an adventurer. At least, I like to do adventurous things. I have never participated as a spelunker or gone cave diving, but I am a diver and have owned and operated my own ocean adventure business, primarily wreck, wall, and cage diving with sharks. I like to think of myself as someone who would remain calm under pressure. Fact is, when push comes to shove, you never really know how you'll react.

People complain about the dialogue. It didn't bother me. It's sparse, and very job-centric, meaning. most of the time, people are talking about what they're doing or what they're about to do. I'll agree that in the very beginning, when we're meeting a couple of the characters, some of the conversation is less than convincing. I mean, we're given a chance to see characters interacting before the tragedy strikes, in the hope that through this interaction, we'll get to know them and their relationships better. For some, this conversation or dialogue didn't work. Maybe they thought it was flat and two-dimensional. Fact is, these characters, these explorers, ARE two-dimensional. People who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of something like this have to be two-dimensional. It's called focus. And part of the story has to do with this very two-dimensionality and the cost that it has on father and son.

The action and exploration of the cave, particularly after the storm hits, is very realistic and at times upsetting and gruesome. Claustrophobics will have a difficult time with this movie, especially, I would think, in 3-d. I didn't see it in 3-d. There are also two pivotal and very dramatic scenes that I wouldn't want kids to watch.

Speaking of these two scenes. The movie is produced, in part, by Cameron, and during these scenes, you can't help but think of Cameron and the movie, The Abyss. These two scenes are very dramatic and intense, but knowing of and appreciating Cameron's fictional work and some of his obsessions yanks you temporarily out of the movie.

I can't say I was completely invested in the characters or that I cared all that much about them. I felt sorry for them at times. And the challenges, pain, tragedy, they had to face and struggle through, kept me on the edge of my seat. Mostly, what I liked about the movie was its study of leadership and survival, the hard decisions only a true leader can make. By the end of the movie, you're left with a better understanding of what it takes to be a real explorer and leader, the cost real leadership can have on a person's private life.

There's is a scene in the film where it becomes obvious the cavers are going to be in a life and death struggle, that the chances for survival are very small. People start to freak and the main character pulls them together with a comment that basically amounts to: This is it. This is what true exploration is all about. Not the game, the fun or the thrill. When no matter how good you are it all goes to s*** and you have to find your own way out.",1403308800,,3282,4.554237288135593
4220923,3,B003Y5H51K,The 3d is not that good. I watched it on a Samsung 7100 series big screen 2013 model. The tv is top of the line. This movies picture quality was snowy along with other imperfections that really affected the quality of the 3d. Even had an old projector type line going down the screen. This movie should of been a great flick to watch in 3d. The frames and borders of the caves ect should of gave it a great depth of view. So thanks for all those people out there giving great 3d reviews of water spilling out of your tv which I seen none of. Nothing about this movie pops. Blurry snowy does not feel like 1080p more like a converted to 3d on a regular up converted dvd.,1402790400,,669,4.114503816793893

The entire movie takes place in a cave and the friends/coworkers have to find a way out.

The dialog was well less than stellar. The photography was adequate. The characters would never be let out of the institute let alone in the water.

And I assure you, all the characters redeem themselves in the end, despite their cartoonish portrayal in the beginning. At least, the few that make it to the end.

If you are an outdoor adventure buff, Highly recommended. P.s. the movie is realistic. I've explored caves with underground river systems and I've scuba-dived in the Cenotes (sinkholes in southern Mexico). Although not with the gear they use in this movie!",1383868800,,729,4.832

4221155,5,B003Y5H51K,"""Sanctum"" is great! This is how the story goes: Master diver Frank McGuire has explored the South Pacific's Esa-ala Caves for months. But when his exit is cut off in a flash flood, Frank's team - including 17-year-old son Josh and financier Carl Hurley - are forced to radically alter plans. With dwindling supplies, the crew must navigate an underwater labyrinth to make it out. Soon, they are confronted with the unavoidable question: Can they survive, or will they be trapped forever?

The cast led by Richard Roxburgh (as Frank) & Ioan Gruffudd (as Carl) is great! The directing by Alister Grierson is great! The story by Andrew Wight & the screenplay by Wight & John Garvin is great!

The music by David Hirschfelder (who also did the music to ""Strictly Ballroom"" (1992), ""Shine"" (1996), ""Sliding Doors"" (1998), ""Elizabeth"" (1998), ""The Weight Of Water"" (2000), ""Australia"" (2008) & ""Legends Of The Guardians: The Owls Of Ga'Hoole"" (2010) is great! The cinematography by Jules O'Loughlin is great! The film editing by Mark Warner (who also did the film editing to ""Rocky III"" (1982), ""48 Hrs."" (1982), ""Staying Alive"" (1983), ""A Soldier's Story"" (1984), ""Weird Science"" (1985), ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989), ""Dolores Claiborne"" (1995), ""A Family Thing"" (1996), ""The Chamber"" (1996), ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997), ""Double Jeopardy"" (1999) & ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" (2001) is great! The casting by Gregory Apps (who also did the casting to ""Proof"" (1991), ""Romper Stomper"" (1992), ""Chopper"" (2000), ""Garage Days"" (2002) & ""Knowing"" (2009) is great! The production design by Nicholas McCallum (who did the art direction to ""House Of Wax"" (2005) is great! The art direction by Jenny O'Connell is great!

This is a great action-thriller that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat (with your heart racing, as well) at the same time. This is an interesting story that looks well in 3D.

If you think you have a strong spirit and personality, you should see this movie; it might change the way you look at life. Richard Roxburgh did a stunning job in his role; you knew what his character was feeling even though he did not let on to it. It takes an exceptionally strong leader to do what must be done, even if it goes against your very nature. Well written, a spot or two where the acting was a little rough (not Roxburgh or the actor who played his son) but all in all a great movie. I would not recommend for children under 13 and even then be prepared to explain why some things have to happen the way they do, especially during extreme and life and death circumstances, but also because of some extreme peril and violence.",1364947200,2,1006,4.328042328042328

Other than learning about scuba diving in caves, it really wasn't all that interesting. I actually regret seeing this movie as a lot of the scenes were cringe-worthy. The one thing I did appreciate was that if someone is claustrophobic, diving underwater in caves is terrifying. One of the scenes does a great job with letting the audience know how and why this is a tangible fear. I just failed to see any redeeming quality to take away from this. There was not enough of character-building to make this worth watching at all. One scene, I can't get out of my head and deeply regret have seen.

4221240,5,B003Y5H51K,"The title of this excellent film is particularly well chosen, as ""sanctum"" means a secret place known only to few people and also a sacred or holy area. This film tells the story of a group of people who are forced by circumstances to enter such a place - and then try desperately to find a way out... This review contains some limited SPOILERS.

Produced by James Cameron this film contains some elements (the masterful use of lights and shadows, a predisposition for blue and gray, some very dramatic fast happening scenes) which remind of his films. It was however directed by an Australian director, Alister Grierson, who made only one film before, ""Kokoda"", which was a rather good war movie. With the exception of Ioan Gruffudd actors were unknown to me, but they all did an excellent job.

The story is relatively simple. A group of cave-divers is slowly and methodically exploring and mapping a HUGE complex of partially inundated caves in New Guinea. An unexpected development will force them to explore this place in depth (pun very much intentional) and on the double, taking enormous risks - and I am not saying anything more.

This film has absolutely NO supernatural elements - do not expect monsters, mysterious forces, etc. Everything is realistic, sometimes inspired by real problems met by speleologists and cave-divers in the real life - even if the accumulation of all those events during just one expedition is of course rather unlikely, but after all this is an adventure film...

The atmosphere of the place of action is absolutely unique. There are moments that I really had the impression that heroes entered a kind of grandiose heathen temple, immensely ancient and so holy that it was never meant to be seen by humans. And indeed, at moments there seems that there is a HIGH price to pay for discovering secrets and splendors, which were not really meant for us. It can almost seem that those who entered there were not meant to leave - and this chtonic ""inner sanctum"" will show great reluctance to release those who violated its peace...

This movie had temporary potential in the very beginning, but just went downhill. The dialogue was cliche and plot predictable. The characters made unrealistic decisions that lead to their deaths. Idiocy spread like the raging water that filled the caves. I was surprised all the females died because usually a female always makes it out alive with the surviving hero, or the female herself is the lone survivor. However, all the females in Sanctum were idiots and didn't deserve to survive. I felt more people should have survived. I think if they threw a supernatural element into the story it could have gone way further given the location and plot. On the pros side, the sets and locations were nice.

4221367,1,B003Y5H51K,"It's generally a good sign that when a big name producer/director is tagged to a movie with a ""Presents"" or ""Produced by"" line that something is amiss.  Shame on Cameron for this pathetic marketing grab.  I cannot fathom how this man felt this movie would help his reputation.

Sanctum is a terrible movie experience.  I found nothing redeeming in this mish-mash of movie cliches and horrible wastes of money.

1.  The acting is atrocious.  Everyone is over-acting or just failing miserably in every sense of the word.  Not only is there a sheer lack of talent here but they show absolutely no conscious ability to even remotely get into the situation they are supposed to be in.  However this is due to two larger issues as well.

2.  Embarrassing writing.  The screenplay for this film is a giant steaming turd.  The characters are all unlikable.  Not a single one has any redeeming trait.  The film basically moves from one terrible movie cliche to the next.  We have the pouty teenage boy rebelling from his famous explorer dad, the over cocky no fear rich guy with his snotty out of her league girlfriend, the abrasive father who pushes too hard, and the sage sidekick with some ironic ailment for the job he is doing.  Everything in this film is predictable and the writers didn't seem to care.  Whats worse is the pathetic attempts to generate drama are insulting.  The father son quarrels and bonding moments a midst a major disaster are just ludicrous and had me literally cursing the screen.

3.  Directing.  The director got nothing out of his actors here and most likely was incompetent to do anything different.  The actors had no flow.  One minute they would be screaming and crying, the next minute they are smiling, joking around and taking pictures like tourists.  This is not just bad acting, it's bad directing.  Clearly the actors were losing their sense of direction from a broken up shooting schedule.  The director should have kept them in the moment but failed to do so.  The main character is this no name teenage boy whose basic range of acting is grinning like a moron to squinting really hard when trying to cry.  Just pathetic.

4.  Cinematography.  The main character in this film was supposed to be the cave but the combination of terrible camera work combined with shoddy CGI just made the whole film look terrible.  Half the time you couldn't see anything because the cameras just couldn't catch the action.  Camera angles and positions were poorly chosen and I suspect budget concerns didn't allow for many reshoots.  Later on in the film they give you wide angle shots of CGI caves that are so far back you can't make anything out.  Much of the film has you starring at a rock wall with no clue where you are supposed to look.

By about halfway through the film I stopped caring if these morons made it out of the cave alive.  Perhaps most insulting was how it climaxes.  There was no story, just some cheesy disaster film thrown together with no direction and a lot of bogus cheesy film cliches.  Waste of time and money.  Don't even rent this one.  It only encourages them to make more of this trash.  Shame on you James Cameron indeed!",1333929600,6,3173,4.6516245487364625

Actor Richard Roxburgh (Frank) puts in a fabulous performance, but while watching this movie I kept finding myself noting most of the other performances seemed poor (especially the ladies) as well as some of the interaction scripting.  (a bad sign in a movie)

Thanks to solid performances from the mostly Aussie cast, we feel their struggle and desperately hope for a satisfactory outcome.

The scenes from the inside of the cave are majestic - Cameron knows how to make nature even more awesome than it is by itself but he can't direct real dialogue worth a darn. Maybe he can blame the(other) writers but this is often a weakness in his movies -- he requires a macho/military/taskmaster type for the other characters to play off of-- it can work but not if they are spouting stupid-isms like the 2 Alpha males in this movie.

4221408,4,B003Y5H51K,"I'm deciding whether Sanctum deserves a 3 or 4-star rating... since I'm in a good mood, we'll go with a 4.

The biggest problem by *far* is that the first 30 minutes is some of the most basic and predictable Jurassic Park-like writing I've ever had to endure.  I flat out *hate* the 30 minutes that open Sanctum.  No, there's no dinosaurs roaming around, but the adventurous flow and the average writing makes the two films strikingly similar.

Only when the one woman is determined to not put on the diving suit of a dead person does the storytelling improve.  This is what, 45 minutes in?  Even the death scene before this is exaggerated and uninteresting.  You really have to wait a while for things to improve and I honestly can't blame you if the boredom sets in sooner rather than later and encourages you to shut the movie off.

Luckily the second half of the movie actually lives up to the suspense that was promised through the advertisements.  It's an underwater diving mission through deep dark caves that goes horribly wrong for the entire diving team, and people die one by one.  That just about sums up what you can expect.

The storyline eventually improves as the film rolls forward so you probably won't be disappointed in the end, but again, the beginning is torturous for viewers because of the blandness and mediocrity of the writing.  You've been warned.  There's even a touching moment involving a father and son, which is probably the number one reason I'm giving Sanctum a passing grade.

Our adventurers are trying to figure out how all the rainwater that comes in through a giant hole in the ground makes its way to the ocean.  Couldn't all this energy and money be better spent on finding a cure for cancer or a better way to avoid traffic?  Why would anyone care about rain finding its way through a cave?  The thrill is the journey, I guess.

We start out with the grizzled expert played by Richard Roxburgh (""Moulin Rouge""), his teen-age son, his financier (Ioan Gruffudd) and his girlfriend, and an assortment of guides and long time companions.  We know that a tropical storm is approaching, but since it's a day or two away, what the hell, let's go diving!  Now we know based on the filmmaker playbook only one or two will make it out alive.  Sure enough, the storm comes quicker than expected - nice communication - and the flooding begins, cutting off the explorers escape route.  We can pretty much pick off the casualty order although it is more difficult with this film because of the unknown Aussie cast.  So then we have to watch for each cast member to do something stupid that will effectively cause his or her doom.  The script is full of clich&eacute;s and we have a lot of yelling.

The movie does have its moments however.  When the actors manage to shut up, there are some pretty tense scenes squeezing through small openings, getting tangled, getting lost and getting frustrated.  The film also contains some beautiful photography.  Some is underwater and some in real and artificial caves.  The film is rated ""R"" because of a few too many ""F"" bombs.  I suspect it might have done better in theaters with a PG-13.  At least with the ""R"" they could have gone forward with the wet suit changing scene between one of the dead female divers and the hot live one (Alice Parkinson).

This movie was eh there was the obvious diving scenes that was pretty cool and I loved hearing them talk even though I ended up not really caring WHAT they were saying! I think there was some parts that could have been cut out like a lot of the fighting, i got it that daddy and son don't get along from their little chat on the screen so I didn't care for when they were arguing for how many minutes. It annoyed me that Josh blamed his father for that lady drowning...she was freaking tired. he should have demanded her to stay but since she went she wasn't in the state of mind and panicked so fast. I know nothing about diving but I'm sure that if she had gotten rest, her thoughts would have been a lot more clear. When the storm was first starting and those four people were coming back up and they started screaming and dadada, i think they could have made that scene into a 2 minute than instead of what it was. I loved George's character, when he got decompression sickness and was dying that made me upset. It really annoyed me when they were like telling Frank not to drown that one guy that broken every bone in his body like really, so you gonna let him be in pain? i was thinking you are idiots. When Frank and his son made it to where that military thing was they could have done something to get out in my opinion, and than why go back?!?! And all that drama between Karl between Frank and Josh my god....cut that whole crap out...Freaking psycho he deserved to get left alone in the first place. OOH and about his girlfriend if you are unexperienced why they heck are you going down there? I thought Karl said that they met at another expedition that maybe she knew something but than Frank was she came down here knowing nothing, mistake number one and mistake number 2....blah blah blah...where was the sense from her and her boyfriend obviously not where its supposed to be!!! When the son drowned his daddy cuz he was hurt and slowly dying, not gonna lie it made me tear up cuz at that point you just saw that the boy finally understood his father.

I think Frank should have gone all the way, he got everyone to the point where they were and yea he should have been the one to conquer it...but eh whatevs.....

I should have done so because this is a captivating thriller that pushes a lot of emotional buttons in the audience. Even viewing it at home, I can see clearly that some highly sophisticated cameras where in operation here. This is a human story more so than anything else and a fantastic adventure. I was pretty shocked that the death scenes turned out to be so brutal. This was not because of anything gory or grotesque but because the filmmakers put the viewer into the boots of the characters so well that once someone bites the proverbial bullet, it stings much more than in a typical action thriller where people are dying in every other frame of film.

The character of the father may remind many of their own old man, a no nonsense, go for broke fanatic that keeps his more delicate emotions firmly in check while lashing out in anger whenever someone questions his leadership. His son is one member of the new generation of men, sensitive and spoiled, self-centered and attention seeking. The father-son confrontation of wills was a big part of the backbone of this film. The underwater photography glorious and the set design claustrophobic and unsettling.

There are many other cave movies out there, ( The Cave, The Descent and so on ), and most of them rely on tried and true terrors such as monsters and mutants hiding in the dark and waiting for their victims. What I enjoyed about Sanctum is that it forgoes those cliches in favor of a more classic duel between man and nature. The natural world is remarkably beautiful and profoundly dangerous. I personally am not a big fan of cave exploration myself, preferring to get my adrenaline and adventure in other ways, but Sanctum seems to both summon people to explore and at the same time warn them about the possibilities when things go horribly wrong.

4221513,2,B003Y5H51K,"With the name of James Cameron attached as executive producer (actually, he is one of the film's nine producers), you might expect a thrilling adventure tale in ""Sanctum."" The beautifully shot Australian film is about an expedition team led by a veteran cave diver Frank (Richard Roxburgh). The group explores an underwater cave system in Papua New Guinea, but when a cyclone suddenly hits the area, the expedition goes terribly wrong.

Fantastic cinematography cannot disguise a run-of-the-mill script and stock characters including Frank's twenty-something son Josh (Rhys Wakefield), the team's financial backer Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) and his girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson). Like the passengers in ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" they struggle to survive. One major difference is that in ""Sanctum"" we don't really care about the characters.

The screenplay by John Garvin and Andrew Wright is said to be based on the Andrew Wright's real-life experience. It is a terrifying story being trapped inside a flooded cave, but here the story is told in an ineffective way. Some scenes are rather good, I admit. The deluge of water itself is scary to look at, and so are the claustrophobic spaces. It takes cinematic narrative skills, however, to generate tension and suspense, which the director seems to forget to use.

In short, with decent dark cave and underwater shots, ""Sanctum"" attempts to be a gritty survival action movie, which it is not. It needs better storytelling. We don't need a strained father-son relationship. We don't need a Coleridge poem, either. We don't like watching characters constantly make stupid decisions.

4221520,3,B003Y5H51K,"Set in Papua New Guinea, Sanctum (2011) is a film about the struggle to survive in an elaborate system of underground tunnels.  It begins with a wide scope, focusing on a group of scientists exploring a huge cave, and then narrows down to center on a small group of survivors who become trapped underground.

With James Cameron as executive producer, Sanctum has some nicely done underwater sequences, and some cinematic views of nature.  Unlike recent films like The Descent (2005) or The Cave (2005), Sanctum does not feature a threat from some kind of vicious creature.  Instead the danger comes mostly from natural causes.  While Sanctum scores some points in the technical departments, it doesn't exactly break a lot of new ground, and is also weak in character development, dialog, and realism.  The film tries hard, but doesn't quite succeed in telling a story that connects emotionally with the audience.

Expert cave diver Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) is the leader of an expedition exploring a huge subterranean cave, which consists of a system of tunnels, with several sections that are flooded with water.  With bad weather on the way, the team is hurrying to complete their work, before the rains come.  McGuire's son Josh (Rhys Wakefield), has just arrived back at camp with Carl Hurley (Ioan Gruffudd), the man bankrolling the expedition, and Victoria Elaine (Alice Parkinson) his girlfriend.

Incredibly, those at ground level loose communication with the team below, and are unable to warn them that a huge storm has suddenly arrived, and heavy rains soon begin to flood the cave.  Josh doesn't have the best relationship with his father, and they have an argument after a diver accidentally dies.  Josh is on his way out of the cave, but returns to make an unsuccessful attempt to get his father and others on the lower level out, before they are trapped.  Instead, Josh finds himself among those imprisoned, with the route to the surface blocked by water.

Frank immediately takes control of the situation, euthanizing a friend who is gravely injured.  Although he has no solid information about the weather conditions, McGuire feels that the group must continue to descend to avoid being drowned, and somehow find a path to the sea.  The survivors include Josh, Carl, Victoria, and Crazy George (Dan Wyllie), a long time member of McGuire's crew who has been banned from diving for health reasons.  Although she has no diving experience, Victoria manages to make it through a tight squeeze in an underwater cave, as the group emerges in an unexplored underground cavern.  As Frank continues to push forward, constantly barking orders like a drill sergeant, conditions soon begin to worsen.

Once the explorers are trapped, no attention whatsoever is given to anyone outside of the cave, until the very end of the film.  While the survivors may be on their own, and a rescue attempt might be futile, totally ignoring those above seems odd.  There is a brief interlude when the survivors can see the sky, as they explore the remains of a tank from World War II, but they choose to reenter the caves and continue on an underground path.  You have to cut filmmakers some slack for any film set in a cave, as the lighting is almost never realistic.  Even so, Sanctum lacks realism in many other ways.  Swimming in chilly water, the survivors should all be freezing, but only Victoria is shivering.  These people are constantly wet, yet again, only Victoria shows any signs of being cold.  There's a lot of skin exposed, but the group remains injury and scrape free, except for a small mark of Josh's arm.  In general, the geography is pretty whacked, as the group conveniently finds an unlikely path to the sea.

Besides a tale of survival, Sanctum is also about the evolution of Frank and Josh's relationship in a crisis.  The situation is rather clich&eacute;d, as Frank's passion for exploring caves has cost him his family.  The explorer comes across as such an arrogant dislikeable bastard, as Josh and the rest, discover just how hard survival can be.  Enduring the physical hardships involved in making the film, the acting performances by the mostly Australian cast are generally good, probably doing justice to the implausible script.  Rhys Wakefield is a young actor with a lot of potential and good screen presence.  Alice Parkinson is a stunning beauty, who is put through some tough physical trials, and hopefully will be seen much more in the future.  Ioan Gruffudd, known for playing Reed Richards, isn't quite as noble here.

Coming into the project, director Alister Grierson did not have a lot of feature film experience, but he meets the challenge fairly well, delivering an entertaining, but flawed action/adventure that feels like a slightly manipulated ride.  With a little more thought and effort, Sanctum clearly could have achieved much more, but various plot issues keep the film from having more impact.",1313798400,2,4949,4.970838396111787

first the movie storyline...  Me, I didn't like the movie at all....  I disliked soo much, I didn't even finish watching it...  IMO, it was depressing!!!!  maybe I just don't like watching a group of people slowly going to their watery grave by drowning, but, it just wasn't something I could not stand...  moreover, none of the characters were likable, the seemed timid, selfish and somewhat stupid...  except for the father and he just seemed wierd....  Maybe it was the acting, maybe he was supposed to be brave and fearless, IMO, he just came across as being a jerk....  and that son... man, I wanted to slap some sense AND a spine into him myself....

now, for the 3Dness...  I really couldn't see it....  IMO, it is a waste of money to watch in 3D...  as long as you watch either in HD or w/ Blu Ray, I think you'd get the effect of the scenery....

final verdict, I suggest renting first before you buy....  you maybe like me (and quite a few others) and just not like it enough to watch the entire movie let alone purchase it!!!!",1313193600,,1137,4.373205741626794

Household names they may not be to some, but nobody's, they are not and in truth, the director probably needed a few good, fit and flexible actors for this demanding movie.
It's tense, claustrophobic and well paced on the good side. On the bad side it's cliched and predictable. But no more so than a lot of movies about right now.
Anything with James Cameron's name attached to it is going to draw interest, and probably unreal expectations. Avatar this is not, nor even the caliber of The Abyss.

All that said, this ""inspired by true events"" movie is worth seeing in my opinion. The character interactions, life and death scenarios and sheer palpable feel of the underwater scenes make it worth it.
Not a new story, cave diving team get trapped by weather, must go down and in, to get out. Unknown territory, virgin caves, cold, wet and the inevitable power struggles between high flying playboy (Gruffudd) and grizzled pro (Roxburgh), who's trying to save the team, and reconcile with his son keeps the story moving forward.

It was a great caving and exploration movie but I think too much was made of saying it was inspired by true-life experiences.  Of course, Pannikin Plain Cave is nowhere as spectacular as the images shown for the movie.  Oh well.  Truth or art?

Well, looks were deceiving in this case. First off, this is one of the worst blu ray transfers I have ever seen. Most of the visuals were still amazing, but it was disappointing that they were grainy. Second, the acting and writing here is extremely poor. It's hard to care about any of the characters or believe they are actually in peril when you're constantly cringing. Third, the story never reaches its potential...it doesn't do enough to hold an audience for more than five minutes at a time. I understand that the intent was to make a realistic movie, but come on, even if they had thrown in some cheesy cave monster or some tribe of underground cavemen at least the movie have been interesting. I'm not saying that this movie necessarily needed a major plot change...it's just that I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen that would make me care, it never did. I am relieved that I picked up a used blu ray copy rather than spending over $20 for a new copy I will probably end up giving away.

The blu ray extras where nothing to get excited about. There is a short documentary featuring the actors and of course James Cameron talking about the making of the film. Most of which centers around the actors talking about their experience working with green screen/CGI technology and whining about how difficult the stunts were.

If you're like me, you loved Cameron's ""The Abyss,"" and wondered if there would be something here to love. If you're like me, you'll regret even spending the dollar at Redbox to find out otherwise.

""Sanctum"" is centered around a team of cave explorers in Papua New Guinea (actually filmed in Australia) as they go deep into a cave purported to be one of the world's most unexplored and possibly largest systems. Of course, a tropical storm is on the way, but they all believe they'll be just fine, with a few days to spare. The storm turns into a typhoon, the comm system goes down, and the team is trapped deep in the earth as the torrent of rain causes the water to rise within the caverns and threaten their lives. In the midst of these struggles, we find a teenaged boy at odds with his famous explorer-dad, and others who are more interested in self-preservation than in any act of human decency. We find bits of ""The Abyss,"" ""Alien,"" and ""The Descent"" all mish-mashed into a colossal mess.

The first obstacle for me was the ridiculous dialogue, which sounded like teenagers trying to impress friends and screenwriters trying to fabricate drama. The next obstacle was the world-class explorers who panic and turn on each other the moment any danger hits. The third obstacle was the typhoon which arrives in seeming minutes, with no time to warn anyone even though a storm was known to be approaching days earlier. The fourth obstacle was watching experienced explorers leave others far behind in caves and then asking where they are. This is just ridiculous behavior by anyone who has spent more than a few hours outdoors or in the wild. The fifth obstacle was the tribal man shown three or four times for no purpose other than to suggest, I guess, that he has called this storm upon those desecrating his land with their exploration. If, in fact, he was meant to issue a warning, he never did so. It seemed his purpose was forgotten by the directors and writers. The sixth reason was that the film's two women are said to be adventurous in one case, and very experienced at cave-exploration in the other case, yet both die due to their own panicky reactions to things. Apparently women just can't handle the pressure of being in such a pathetic movie.

I stopped caring ten minutes into the movie, but kept watching for the few scenes of beauty and natural wonder (the only reason for giving it one star). I began hating the script forty minutes into it, and by the hour-mark I hated myself for wasting a dollar and my evening. If you're like me, you'll want to pass on this mess.

I don't mind tight spaces as long as there is a clear way out but if you throw water in there you couldn't pay me enough money to go down there and I think thats what draws you into this movie.

Its also refreshing to see a cave movie that doesn't have some kind of creature trying to kill them, those types of horrors like ""decent"" or ""the cave"" take away from the truly scary and very real killer that is the cave its self.

Forget those critics who have lost sight of what watching a movie is all about and just be entertained. Critics are like junkies their first film is a great high and then they spend the rest of the time trying to re live that moment but no film ever lives up to it so they just spend their time complaining.

4221688,5,B003Y5H51K,"Sanctum, is a brilliantly planned Movie. From the Genius who brought us the movie Avatar, James Cameron the Executive producer did it again. The back-story behind this Amazing story is one of the divers that escaped from this incident also happened to be one of the writers. By having one of the actual survivors of the event they could more accurately tell the story of what happened down in that cave. Although as in most movies to keep the viewer entertained they had to variate the movie from some actual events. The director was unknown for he had not made a movie since 2006 and he had also not made a feature length. So for his first full length movie in 2011 I'd say he did a fantastic job.

 There were very few characters for the surprising budget spent which amounted to 30 million. For being a James Cameron film that is still relatively low though. There were only 13 cast member throughout the whole movie. yet only 7 were shown for more than 5 minutes of the 108 minute film. These talented cast member name in the film were, Frank, Carl, Josh, Victoria, George, J.D., and Luko.
The ever expanding cave was the setting for the movie.

 The Thrilling plot for this movie was The members listed above spent thousands of dollars bringing equipment down to a cave to explore it. previously unexplored the group had no idea what they were getting into as they experience problems in the first dive. This causing Josh the son of Frank to start to doubt if his father the ""supposed""  expert. As the plot continues a storm outside got stronger because of this the cave entrance flooded while they were all still inside. I will respectively leave you here as I don't want to ruin any of the events of the movie. But I will tell you the rest is them trying to escape as they fight the madness.

 The themes of this movie besides drama and intensity would be mixed along so many ways. Although if there was one dominant them in this movie it would be an intensified sense of deception.
Throughout most of the movie your on the edge of your seat wondering who's going to listen and who's going to freak out and go their own way. If this movie were an hour longer I would still be watching it's every step with anticipation.

 I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone willing to watch a movie of this genre. The intensity packed into this movie with those slow dramatic pauses. Just to reel you back in with the next scene. Since this was such an excellent movie I'd see it again.

4221692,3,B003Y5H51K,"SANCTUM (defined as a holy site and a place where one is free from intrusion) is touted to be a film by James Cameron of Titanic and Avatar fame: he is only a producer.  This 3D film would likely be more interesting in a theater where the 3D aspects of the photography by Jules O'Laughlin would enhance the beauty of the film.  But given those aspects of this little movie SANCTUM is a visual delight, a harrowing experience of witnessing nature at her most angry, and a bit of a sentimental slight story about father and son relationships and the interaction of humans when pitted against the hostile vagaries of Nature. Of note this film was written by Australian underwater explorer and photographer Andrew Wight (with assistance from John Garvin and may be based on some true adventures.

Frank McClure (Richard Roxburgh is a grumpy, hard cave explorer and diver exploring the Esa-ala Caves off New Guinea with his trusty support team (Dan Wyllie, Christopher Baker, Nicole Downs, and Cramer Cain) when he is joined by the wealthy but shallow thrill seeker Carl (Ioan Gruffudd), his climber girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson) and Frank's seventeen year old son Josh (Rhys Wakefield, a remarkably impressive handsome young actor from Queensland, Australia): Frank and Josh have never been close nor understood each other.  The mission is to explore the cave's connection to the sea and all goes well until the descent begins.  A storm begins and becomes a cyclone, filling the cave with rushing water in which members of the exploration team are lost. As the numbers of the groups taper down we're left with a father/son confrontation before the explorer party dwindles down to one.

Director Alister Grierson in tandem with his special effects people make the most out of this rather superficial and flimsy script.  The cast is Australian and Welsh for the most part and the film was shot primarily in Australia.  The scenery, both above and below the ground is the real star here and the film's primary appeal is the nature of Nature. Keep expectations low and the film will entertain.

As for the story, it was pretty silly and certaintly cheesed up for the big screen.  I found alot of the movie itself rather predictable and full of mediocre acting.  There was some suspense to the movie, just waiting for something to happen.  There are no monsters or creepy critters in the cave, it is based on true events, however ""based on"" is a loosely used term.  Overall the movie was alright, worth watching once not really anything spectacular.  The 3d didn't really impress me all that much, it was average.  Really it just tried to bring you more into the cave with them, then to project items outside of it.

4221718,2,B003Y5H51K,"Not sure what to make of this film. As I'm typing this - it's thirty minutes in and so far I'm basically watching 'The Abyss Part 2'.

Abyss Checklist:

- Deep unexplored water, check.
- Technology used to exploit/explore same, check.
- Pet named submersible ROV, check.
- Storm threatening support crew far above, check.
- Dark foreboding water sequences, check.
- Close up of a woman drowning, check.
- Loss of communications with the outside world, check.

The point of all this James Cameron homage/brown-nosing would be... what... exactly?

Now I'm genuinely terrified that a bunch of glowing aliens will be at the bottom of this cave. I hope not. So help me, if any Colonial Marine shows up with armor piercing rounds to shoot a Cyberdyne product - I'm fast forwarding to the last ten seconds of the movie.

And back to the show...

Minute 35 - I tell you, it doesn't pay to be a female in this flick. Ouch.

Minute 47 - Screaming in place of dialogue. Excellent. I'm hoping Sergeant Apone makes an appearance. Still, as Luko is the token person of color in the film, I'm guessing the filmmakers have already met their racial quota.

Minute 49 - Oops, spoke to soon. Having just offed his friend, the transparent plot now clearly reveals our anti-hero will not make it out of the movie alive. Too bad, he's the one character that has more to him than a cardboard cut-out of a role to step into.

Minute 53 - So, let me get this straight. Women are: Prone to overestimating their abilities, likely to panic, get randomly entangled and bonked on the noggin, make foolish choices (I'm not wearing a dead person's wetsuit because I know I'd prefer freezing to death), and are foul-mouthed extroverts who can't deal with stress. And big surprise - Director Alister Grierson is from Australia. Yup.

1:12 - Woman weak. Man strong. Dang sheilas.

1:14 - Just noticed that Grierson just ripped himself off with a repeat of the entangled woman under falling water making a bad choice. Can you even rip yourself off in the same flick? Male chauvinism deux?  :-D

1:15 - Someone, anyone, call the screenwriting police!

And it's over.

Underwater scenes were middling to pretty spectacular. And that's about it. The story is derivative, predictable and overwhelmingly underwhelming. One also has to deal with a disturbing fatalism that's woven into the entire film: Gotta keep an eye on those young-ings, lest you get old or injured and can't keep up.

Cameron's blockbusters were never lauded for their scripts but for his genius in creative film-making, visually breathtaking and stunning.  He also had the starpower of DiCaprio, Winslet, Weaver, etc.
SANCTUM doesn't have those hit making elements.
SANCTUM does have some chilling moments but the script's cliches and banal dialogue are tedious and uninvolving.  Some of the editing is sloppy and David Hirschfelder's score is routine and disappointing.
Richard Roxburgh is quite good as the cold-hearted leader and father; Rhys Whitfield is effective as the estranged son and Alice Parkinson is a good anti-Sigourney as the doomed girlfriend who makes three bad decisions.  But the Rod Steiger Overacting Award goes to Ioan Gruffurd's billionaire Carl whose descent into madness is almost laughable and unrealistic.

Like westerns filmed in Death Valley, the old Iverson Ranch, or up near Ranger Rock, Sanctum comes to life in the depths of the cave environment.  I did not see it in 3D, so I cannot judge the cinematography, but on a regular TV, it was amazing.  The sheer beauty, the sheer awesomeness of the caves, the close quarters, and the ugly side of deep sea diving is inspiring.

Filmwise, I can certainly say that I would not want to be faced with the decisions that Josh and his father made.  Mind you, this is truly, a life or death situation.  Do you bring someone through the caves (who is certain to die), and will most certainly cause your death?  Whose life is important?

This is a film that begs the question, a film that could easily be about a group of people starving on a island without food (except each other), or a shipful of people floating on an ocean waiting for rescue.

8408769,4,B003Y5H51K,"Sanctum is a fairly predictable formulaic movie of a group of cave divers, along with some such as a girlfriend who weren't planning to, being forced to dive deep into the unknown in a hope that they will find where the rain water that goes into a massive hole in Papua New Guinea, ends up coming out at sea.  Now perhaps this was their only solution, but I was waiting for an explanation of why they couldn't just don the scuba tanks, and stay in the cavern they were in, with all the spare tanks roped to them, if it filled up with water from the cyclone, they could then go through the tunnel with what little air (tanks) they could carry on their backs, or use up the same amount, if not more air they would have from the other tanks as well, staying exactly where they were until the water dropped enough for them to have some air pockets, or back to the original cavern space level. Perhaps it would never have rose high enough to need the tanks, or they could have constructed with the tarps and stuff some areas to make air pockets. They've got a billionaire with them, it's not like there's not going to be a rescue attempt launched straight away, clearing whatever debris and rocks are between the outside world and the first place they'll look - that cavern, an hour later or whenever the cyclone has left.

But the movie is what it is, unfortunately you know who are the token to be killed off initially characters. ""Bet you he dies!"" You'll say to someone else, and you'll be right. ""Bet you that present he hates, he'll need at one point,"" and things like this.  It has some really odd music at the start, like from some old 70's TV show or something, and of course we have Australians putting on American accents, so they sound neither like Australians or Americans. The dad character who is also the expert cave diver, likes to yell all his lines.  The bimbo girlfriend was a bit dumb to be believable and inconsistent.  She was supposed to be a rock climber but needed help and assurance the son ""has her"" to abseil into the hole. Surely repelling down rocks would be done when rock climbing. Refusing a wet suit because it had been worn by another woman might be a fashion choice, but surely you'd wear one rather than freeze to death.  The fact the others even let her come when making such as stupid decision didn't seem plausible.

Although you can predict the outcome for the group who set off to find freedom, it's still a fun movie.  At times it's obvious when we're looking at the flooded sound stage at Warner Brothers Movie World. but there's enough real footage of actual caves to give the movie some authenticity feel wise and it would be impossible with non light and not much space to film this all in them anyway.  Sanctum isn't a true story, but was written by the writer Andrew Wight (one of)  who was a cave filmer, who in 1988 with 13 people decided to go down a similar looking hole to the Papua New Guinea one in the film, in the remote Australian Nullabor.  A freak storm turned up dropping months worth of rain which caused a landslide which buried all their gear.  He climbed out and got help and everyone was rescued.  He mentioned to James Cameron they should one day make a cave diving disaster movie.  Sanctum is it.",1520035200,,3261,4.413333333333333
