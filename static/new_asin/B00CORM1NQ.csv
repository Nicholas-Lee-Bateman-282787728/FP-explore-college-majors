5731508,5,B00CORM1NQ,"I hope the way episode 24 ended is not the ""real"" end. The writing is, as usu, superb. Each and every character fully carry their weight, but i must admit that i am partial to gunvald, mikael persbrandt.
an aside, from the first time i saw gunvald dance, i knew he had some classical training. trained as a ballet dancer. ck him dancing on youtube-graceful and comical. enjoy",1427760000,,375,4.529411764705882
5731509,5,B00CORM1NQ,"It is not as sophisticated/complicated from a Crime point of view, but the characters
just keep you glued to the screen. Humanity wins another one.",1393891200,,147,4.92
5731510,5,B00CORM1NQ,"When I watch an episode of the show, I can't wait until I can purchase the dvd. There are so many parts to each character that you can watch these over and over and still find out something different about each character. I really like it when they are involved with people other than Swedish, it makes you realize how close the other countries are and makes you wonder what it would be like in the states if we each spoke different languages and had different law systems in place. I know it is true that the people there can speak other languages, but they also have to understand them and where they are from. This show does a great job in showing that this is just a way of life there and treating everyone's problems or crimes the same. I really hope there will be more episodes because these characters are too good to not make more and the stories are always top notch. PS I have all the dvds and watch them over and over and still enjoy them very much.",1379030400,,960,4.251366120218579
5731511,5,B00CORM1NQ,Superb writing and acting! The stories were intriguing with one surprise after another. The characters are interesting and memorable. Buy it!,1377043200,,141,5.761904761904762
5731512,3,B00CORM1NQ,Not as unique as earlier episodes. I think  that the writer's are running out of steam. Production and acting just fine,1376956800,,119,4.666666666666667
5731513,5,B00CORM1NQ,"I've been a fan of this series for quite a while, particularly for the uniformly high quality of the acting, the quirky and prickly relationships between the main characters, and the timeliness of the issues that are addressed.  These three episodes are as smartly produced and engaging as previous ones, and I look forward to seeing more in the future.",1376006400,2,353,4.883333333333334
5731514,5,B00CORM1NQ,"Well done, insightful entertainment.  The characters are interesting, especially Beck, Gunvald and Beck's daughter Inger.  Recommended for people of all ages.",1375488000,,158,6.476190476190476
5731515,1,B00CORM1NQ,"I hate this. -- Each of these episodes as described are ones I've seen before. I ordered the 19-21 episodes, hoping to catch the final seasons, but, while the first two were new to me (though it was clear they appeared earlier in the line-up) the third is The Japanese Painting, which I've seen twice (due to it's having been cleverly inserted into another 'new' season); it's one of the best, but I really don't want to see it again.
This series is among the best available. But the dvd mixers and sellers do a disservice in palming off duplicates of episodes they've already sold us in the past. Watch and read the titles before you buy.",1372464000,8,639,4.47008547008547
8584084,5,B00CORM1NQ,"Who wouldn't love Martin Beck?  I have every film, every episode and love them all.  Beck and Gunvald's characters are so opposite at times they are hilarious and yet they manage their differences and work really well together as well as with the others on the team.  Great!  I love Gunvald's sarcasm, very dry sense of humor against Martin's slow and take it easy think it through calm.",1516924800,,387,4.647058823529412

8584088,5,B00CORM1NQ,"This is the final (?) set of Beck episodes from MHz networks #22-24 tho episode 25 & 26 do exist for sale on Amazon UK in region 2 format. Those episodes are sold individually and quite expensive (nearly $35 apiece US after currency exchange & shipping). These last 3 episodes here, are like the previous 7 seasons which I own with three 90 minute installments. Beck is a great swedish police detective show with 2 great lead cops, grisly crimes, plus eccentric characters (Beck's next door neighbor is a 'strange duck' but also hilarious). American audiences will find much to like in this series particularly if you've seen The Killing, or Wallender or The Bridge. It should be understood that Beck is a 'series' in that many of the same characters run thru the 24 episodes but they often do not run seamlessly from one to the next like most American shows like NYPD Blue, CSI, etc (which are also great BTW). Story lines and characters can just 'disappear' from one episode to the next which can be frustrating to American audiences unfamiliar with that style of TV. But you begin to just 'roll with it' after awhile and enjoy the episodes individually and appreciate that Scandinavia, France, Germany, Britain do crime shows 'different' than we do and that's part of the fun of discovering them. Discovering nordic crime shows like Beck has been a treat for me because it led to so many other great cop shows from the other countries I listed that you can never see on American TV, but can if you invest $40 in a region 2 DVD player like I did.",1451520000,,1548,4.592057761732852
