3149608,5,B00161C3KW,"The 1922 ""Prisoner of Zenda"" is surely one of the best silent films ever made.  Its major actors knew better than to over-emote and it obviously had a very competent director in Rex Ingram. Even though the plot,costumes, and scenery are straight out of an operetta, the players mostly come off as natural, demonstrating that good acting was not something that somehow emerged with the advent of sound.  Even Ramon Navarro as the villainous Rupert of Hentzau shows himself to be far more than just a pretty face as he turns his role into a droll, animated tour de force.

The picture begins in the manor house of Englishman Rudolph Rassendyll, the camera zeroing in on the extremely beautiful eyes of Lewis Stone, by now a 43-year-old stage veteran who, in most other respects, looks like a rather ordinary middle-aged man in trim physical condition.  But, of course, there is nothing ordinary about Stone's histrionic talent and, besides, he has all the charm that made him so beloved as Judge Hardy about 15 years later in the ""Andy Hardy"" series.  Rassendyll decides to attend the coronation of his cousin, Rudolph of Ruritania, [whose twin he could be] and finds his kinsman to be a dissipated mess.  Lewis Stone plays both parts, needless to say.  The weak king-to-be has an ambitious but evil brother, Duke Michael, who plots to seize the throne for himself and kill Rudolph in the process.  On the eve before the coronation, the duke arranges for his brother to be drugged so that he will not be in any shape to attend the ceremony.  Therefore, the king's loyalists persuade the British Rassendyll to take his place for a day and keep Michael from having his way.

The Ruritarian Rudolph has a beautiful fiancee played by the luminous Alice Terry.  The couple do not have much use for one another but she is a popular princess who would serve to bolster Rudolph's own shaky position.  However, Rassendyll and the lovely girl take to one another at once and, sensing an unexpected change in her intended, the princess no longer sees her role as future queen as a mere duty.  Of course, the plot thickens and there is another female involved, played by the alluring but less natural actress, Barbara La Marr.  Rudolph Rassendyll cannot go home to England after the coronation but must stay on in order to help rescue his endangered royal cousin. There is skull-duggery aplenty and sword-play, too.  All make for a fascinating film and it is quite a revelation to see how effective a younger, doe-eyed version of old Judge Hardy is in the love scenes.  Pretty sexy!
It is probably no accident that the actor who played the dual role in the next ""Prisoner of Zenda"", Ronald Colman, resembled Lewis Stone quite a lot.",1281744000,11,2718,4.738853503184713

8260652,5,B00161C3KW,"The Prisoner of Zenda is one of my favorite stories. I saw the 1937 version as a child, and I still remember it. I read the book and its sequel as an adult, and I have the 1952 remake with Stewart Granger as well as the 1937 version with Ronald Colman. I recently added the 1979 comedy version with Peter Sellers, so this silent version seemed just the thing. The picture quality is very good for a silent film. The piano score is of course new, and some of the title cards may have been redone. It all actually looks pretty good.",1497830400,,530,4.205882352941177
8260653,3,B00161C3KW,"This silent suffers from the same failing that most reissue's of silent films suffer from: a poor soundtrack. I can't describe how many great classic movies have been ruined by bad modern soundtracks. The soundtrack itself isn't unpleasant, I like the tune. But 1 hour and 53 minutes of the same 8 or so minute stanza on repeat? They couldn't even develop one more stanza of music? This is not how silent films were meant to be watched, they were meant to be watched with interchanging tunes that develop and complement the emotion of the story.

As for the story and plot, it's great! The filming is great, inter titles are in depth and the characters are vibrant. This is a top notch film ruined by modern music.",1493769600,,714,4.578125
8260654,4,B00161C3KW,"Not bad - an enjoyable adaptation of the old chestnut. However at 43 Lewis Stone was too old, too bland for the role. (Ronald Colman was even older when he played it, but he carried it off.). Alice Terry was very good, as always. But the surprise for me was Ramon Novarro - wonderful as the rogue, Rupert of Hentzau. Too bad MGM didn't film him in an adaptation of the sequel - ""Rupert of Hentzau"". Amazing to see the kind of productions MGM could regularly produce and to think of how much they would cost now. But I suppose it would all be done digitally now. The streaming print is good, a few of the intertitles too dark. There are a few obviously missing sequences but nothing too terrible. Beware of the score which consists of the same 15 seconds of music repeated for nearly 2 hours. Turn down/off the volume to protect your sanity.",1482451200,4,840,4.391025641025641

8260659,3,B00161C3KW,"Metro's 1922 version of The Prisoner of Zenda is an early example of what would later become the house style for many forgotten prestige pictures at MGM in the Thirties: a lot of money, a lot of class but not a lot of panache or excitement for much of the running time. It's a solid rather than inspired adaptation (already the third) that's hampered somewhat by a plot that isn't always silent movie-friendly, with much of the first half of the film taken up with character actors sitting at tables delivering exposition. Lewis Stone may be closer to novelist Anthony Hope's hero Rudolf Rassendyll than later incarnations, very much the distinguished and capable middle aged English gentleman but not exactly over-blessed with charisma in either role, though at times he looks so very like Ronald Colman you can understand why the latter would be cast in the classic 1937 version. For charisma you have to look to Ramon Novarro's charmingly duplicitous Rupert of Hentzau (""While you're unhung, Hell lacks its master!""): just on the cusp of stardom and heroic roles he knows he's got the best part in the picture and knows just how to steal it. Other key roles, like Robert Edeson's Colonel Zapt, aren't so well cast as in later versions, but Alice Terry and Barbara La Marr make formidable leading ladies.

Rex Ingram's direction is somewhat hit and miss. He never disgraces himself but he seems hampered by the talkative nature of the plot and in the first half of the film it's only in sporadic scenes like the coronation that he really seems to show what he can do. As if realising this the second half peps up quite substantially with assassination attempts, swordfights and the rescue of the real king from Zenda, all of which may not be as elaborately executed as later versions but are still undeniably enjoyable. In the process the growing love story between Rassendyll and the King's betrothed tends to get short shrift and has to be taken largely on faith, which takes some of the pathos away from the inevitable ending when honour trumps desire. Nonetheless, it's one of those stories it's almost impossible to not make an entertaining film out of (though Peter Sellers and company certainly did their best, or worst) and it's certainly one of the better adaptations even if it doesn't measure up to Colman and Stewart Granger's times trying out the crown of Ruritania for size.

Warner Archive's DVD-R is taken from a reissue print that capitalised on Novarro's stardom by giving him top billing (he was originally billed as Ramon Samaniego) and which is apparently twelve minutes shorter than the original release.",1399248000,7,2628,4.863839285714286
8260660,5,B00161C3KW,The item came on time and was packed in easey open container I would buy from this company again the DVD is without flaw,1339891200,,120,4.041666666666667
8260661,1,B00161C3KW,"The five-star review here must be for the Warner Brothers Archive Collection DVD of ""The Prisoner of Zenda."" If it were for the Grapevine Video release, I'm sure it would have mentioned the abysmal quality of the DVD. Grapevine's transfer to DVD was made from an extremely bad print of the film, with absolutely no attempt at restoration. Many of the title cards are so dark as to be unreadable; surely it would have been a simple matter to create new title cards for this release--unless the Grapevine people couldn't read them either. The contrast in one section of the film is so high that characters and objects are reduced to featureless blobs on the screen.

I agree completely with the other reviewer's comments on the acting and the cinematic qualities of the 1922 film. I'll be returning the Grapvine DVD, and I'm willing to try the Warner Brothers release, but in the meantime I'll stick with the 1937 Ronald Coleman version.",1312675200,20,935,4.771604938271605
