4858235,5,B005QC3CD4,"An American Tragedy is a pre-code classic. Josef von Sternberg was not a conventional director but he did an excellent job with this film. Unlike the remake, we get insight into the character's background. He was always on the run and his idea of love was superficial. Phillips Holmes reveals his inner emotions by a mere look on his face. He hires Roberta (Sylvia Sidney) to work in the factory and while he is out of her point of view, he leers at her. He knows how to work her to get her to invite him into her room and she becomes pregnant. By then, he has met socialite Frances Dee and it is an opportunity for him to move up in social circles. He pushes Roberta aside until he gets an idea as to how to get rid of her and her child. It is his child, too, but that doesn't matter to this sociopath. When the boat capsizes, he swims away. Thus, he runs away once again. The courtroom scene is superb. While the remake, 'A Place in the Sun' is glossy and Roberta (Shelley Winters) is frumpy, Sylvia Sidney makes her far more sympathetic. The socialite part was enlarged for Elizabeth Taylor but in the 1931 film, Frances Dee's role was secondary to Sylvia Sidney. The pre-Code version was able to use a much different slant than the Code film in 1952. I do like 'A Place in the Sun' but I find 'An American Tragedy' to be a classic in pre-Code films.",1436918400,16,1353,4.2890625
4858236,3,B005QC3CD4,"The film is not as creaky as many from that era are, although if you can't stand ""dated"" movies you probably won't like this one either.  The court room scenes are very well done, and form a decent primer for future trial lawyers on the importance of projecting proper emotions.  During a trial the jury focusses on the lawyer, not the client.  Perhaps you can't get away with some of this stuff these days, but you won't know until you try it.  Note:  this film is not a substitute for A Place in the Sun.  If you're curious as to how it got made, Bennett Cerf's memoirs has a discussion about getting Dreiser to sell rights to Hollywood.  Incidentally, Dreiser doesn't sound exactly like a hale fellow well met.",1394064000,10,713,4.48062015503876
8483194,5,B005QC3CD4,"This movie is superlatively directed by Sternberg, especially the first half. He knows how to use light and shadow and composition. Sylvia Sydney is excellent as well as the other cast members (Phillip Holmes and Frances Dee). I love how Sylvia's expression breaks into a smile when she sees Clyde. Their love scenes together are enchanting.

An American Tragedy is a character study of a weak-willed, young man named Clyde Griffiths. Clyde undergoes a series of ""tests"" or events in life which require him to make a decision. From the outset, he's unable to refuse his friends when they insist on going out to party. When his night results in a horrific hit-and-run, Clyde chooses to run despite his being innocent. Later, when he meets a rich young woman, he decides to give into temptation and dump Sylvia Sydney. However, he can't go through with murdering Sylvia, except that circumstances make it possible for him to run just like he did after the car accident. Throughout the trial, he persists in lying, including to his own mother. Only at the end does he finally confess the truth.

The film is also an indictment of the environment and its large part in forming Clyde's character. It's a harsh world. Look at the way he's treated by everyone because he's poor. His wealthy uncle's family seems contemptuous. The workers in the stamp factory are also treated like machines. No wonder he thinks that to be treated with respect you have to have lots of money.

The criminal justice system is also criticized. Look at how the jury decides to condemn Clyde by bullying the lone juror. Also, the defense attorneys only decide to take up the case because they don't like the prosecuting attorney, and not from any moral conviction.

Finally, I should say something about the pacing of the film. It hurtles through Clyde's life to his fate and feels like you're caught up in the cogs and wheels of a machine.",1493337600,,1911,4.764350453172206
8483195,3,B005QC3CD4,"The book was so much better.....I think if they made the movie now, it would be much more captivating and follow the story with better detail...that said...they used what they had back then and made an almost verbatim movie to match the story....still worth a watch",1488585600,,265,4.782608695652174
8483196,3,B005QC3CD4,"i have a lot of problems with a place in the sun, its slight changes from the novel making a titanic reversal to the entire moral thrust of the story, but this really old version makes you appreciate the 1951 film all the more. 'an american tragedy' is such an old movie that it has to hurt it a bit. the acting is so old fashioned and mannered and stark it's a little hard to stomach for a modern person, modern being someone used to seeing movies at least as recent as 1936.  the storytelling of 'an american tragedy' seems very primitive; so many foundational scenes are missing and merely covered by a dialogue card. this is where the more recent george stevens movie makes great strides. all in all, in our time 'an american tragedy' comes off more of a curiosity for film buffs, rather than a great movie. for the record i love many old movies, often preferring them to modern movies. for example, i LOVE the old frederick march 'dr jekkle and mr hyde,' far more than any later version, because it is old and has a much more electrifying moral center, despite the old fashioned acting and cutting, so it's not just that i don't like old things. as far as  'an american tragedy' goes, i still want to hold out for another version for our time; i feel that neither of the extant movies have yet hit the target and really done the theodore dreiser book justice, or wrestled with some of the untouched themes that make the book so interesting.",1488067200,,1445,4.428571428571429

8483198,2,B005QC3CD4,"Substandard Transfer. As another reviewer states, this film is preceded by a statement that the film was restored by  UCLA  film department. his prelude looks the same as the film following it. It is soft, laced with chroma & crawling with digital artifacts, looking for all the world like an Alpha, Brentwood or Mill Creek Entertainment PD copy. There is really no excuse to charge a premium price for a copy of a film that is taken from a substandard video source. Why have a film restored by a major film archive, only to release it in such shoddy condition?",1482451200,2,561,4.6
8483199,5,B005QC3CD4,"A wonderful piece of movie history. Every film buff should see this - interesting comparison to ""A Place In The Sun.""",1470614400,2,117,4.619047619047619
8483200,3,B005QC3CD4,"One has to consider that this is a very early talkie and the copy not the best.  Sometimes the dialogue is hard to understand.  But it is worth having just to watch Sylvia Sidney.  Her portrait of the girl is so much better than Shelley Winters who whined and kvetched during the whole movie.
But Phillips Holmes is no actor.  I can see why he was popular with his good looks but his acting leaves a lot to the imagination.  Some of the other actors chew more scenery than Mandy Patinkin but one has to remember it was filmed in 1930 or 1931.  Frances Dee's part is much smaller than  Elizabeth Taylor's in the remake.  Montgomery Clift and Anne Revere are much better in A PLACE IN THE SUN.  But this is worth having for collectors and for the fine performance by Sylvia Sidney.  The poor thing had to stamp collars all day but never whined like Shelley did in the remake.",1446249600,4,873,4.333333333333333
8483201,3,B005QC3CD4,No Place in the Sun but a fairly good restoration imminently watchable. I agree with Maltin a strangely Unminvolving movie. Holmes was a real drag with little charisma. He may have blossomed if he hadn't had such an untimely death. Sylvia Sydney as usual great.well worth a look.,1443398400,,279,4.833333333333333

8483203,4,B005QC3CD4,"Sternbergs AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY (1931) has been waiting in the wings for Universal to finally add it to their MOD-DVD-r Vault Series.  Alas its only an adequate copy, obviously derived from an old video master, tho theres a lead-in stating it was sourced from a restored UCLA Archives print.  Yet its certainly a welcome release for anyone with a serious interest in cinema of this era ... the film has a fascinating history as a studio project, with Dreiser, Eisenstein and others involved, ending up in Sternbergs hands, with enough of his unique visual flourishes to make it unmistakably his, working with ace cameraman Lee Garmes just prior to SHANGHAI EXPRESS.  Contrast is good, but clarity is only satisfactory, no better.  Now, we just need Universal to release THUNDERBOLT (1929) to complete the Sternberg titles available from their holdings on DVD/DVD-r.

Still have high hopes that the Sternberg-Dietrich titles will eventually make it to blu-ray/fully restored, befitting Sternbergs legacy as a master stylist, and in keeping with Universals touted commitment toward preserving its important holdings in the best versions possible.",1437264000,22,1143,5.3277777777777775
