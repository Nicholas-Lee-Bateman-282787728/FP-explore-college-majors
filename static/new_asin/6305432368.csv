1041882,4,6305432368,Always loved this movie.  There is a background clip not included here where Ms. Swanson indicates a bit of real hostility to Mr. Madsen.  Of course he is always the hero or the turd you love to hate.,1377216000,,200,4.2368421052631575
1041883,5,6305432368,Good story line. Good play off by the actors with the banter back and forth. Liked it a lot. Good buy for the price,1368144000,,115,3.8333333333333335
1041884,5,6305432368,"Essentially, Supreme Sanction is about abuse of power. A clandestine U.S. government agency called Alpha Section is engaged in Counter Terrorism or CT. The government has been cutting back on funding for counter terrorism (you can tell this was made before September 11th, 2001) and the administrators of Alpha Section come to the conclusion that if their agency's funding is ever going to be restored to its previous high level, then the agency is going to have to create a domestic terrorism scare by engaging in terrorism itself.

The movie begins with a helicopter belonging to an alleged terrorist group in Arizona shooting down a National Guard chopper. Another guard helicopter then shoots down the terroristic copter. In the ensuing investigation, the lead investigator starts to come close to the truth about the alleged terrorist group and just who is behind it and Alpha Section reacts by having one of its top assassins, Jenna (Kristy Swanson) kill him off. This assassination not only removes a threat to the agency's agenda, but it also helps further a domestic terrorism scare in the country.

However, unknown to the Alpha Section higher-ups, Jenna became disenchanted with her job once she realized the full implications of the hit. When the agency tasks her to assassinate award winning TV investigative reporter Jordan McNamara (David Dukes), her feelings towards her employers come to a boil and she rescues him from a certain death. Both Jenna and McNamara are subjected to a harrowing chase by terroristic government agents who will stop at nothing to kill them off.

Eventually, they make their way to the secret hideout of the ""invisible man"" Marcus (Donald Faison) who is a scientific genius of the first order. Marcus helps Jenna and McNamara craft a plan aimed at both eliminating as many government thugs as they can as well as exposing the evil Alpha Section as the out of control agency that it really is.

While the above may sound like a farfetched plot, the way that this movie is executed, it is a well done action thriller and it actually holds up to repeated viewings. The acting is very good especially by Swanson, Faison and Ron Perlman in the role of the chief administrator of Alpha Section. Of all the main actors, only Michael Madsen turns in a poor showing.",1140825600,7,2300,4.920103092783505
1041885,3,6305432368,"A government assassin develops the most deadly weapon of all...a conscience.

A government assassin (Kristy Swanson) refuses to kill a reporter (David Dukes) and instead teams up with him to break the story of corruption in her agency, all the while being hunted by her ex-superior (Michael Madsen) and protected by her good natured ""gadget man"" (Donald Faison).

This is an above average TV movie that's simply fun to watch.

Be on the lookout for Ron Perlman as ""the-iceman-cometh"" bad guy looking through the world with rose colored glasses.",1106006400,2,544,5.089887640449438
1041886,3,6305432368,"This is really a shame. Supreme Sanction is a fast-moving, enjoyable action thriller, but so much of it has been copied from other movies. The 'assassin refuses to shoot and becomes a target himself' theme is straight  out of Replacement Killers. The 'Government agency fakes terrorist attack  to get more funding' comes out of Long Kiss Goodnight' and the helicopter  stunts that open the movie are the same footage I saw in Firebirds. This  said, Supreme Sanction is a well acted movie with a good script. Madsen an  Swanson do an interesting 'good killer/bad killer routine' and the score  and effects were quite decent. A pity they could not get a more original  story.",957830400,6,673,4.850877192982456

7890811,4,6305432368,Not bad at all. Better than many so-called B-movies. It's got a plot and continuity!,1521417600,,84,4.666666666666667
7890812,5,6305432368,"This is the perfect movie. I like the action and violence. I like the helicopters. I like the pursuit type action. I like the kicking, punching, shooting and explosions. I am really enjoying these action movies from the nineties. They are not 16:9 or theater wide. They are not 5.1 surround sound but the stereo gets split up by a surround decoder for a very pleasant experience. Thanks again, Amazon Prime. After watching numerous 16:9 and 5.1 surround features I realized that I just want good action and violence so I am tripping in the twentieth century.",1520208000,,558,4.762886597938144
7890813,1,6305432368,This movie has way too many stars I am just trying to balance it out. this is a 2 or 3 star movie at best and is showing up on Amazon Prime as 4.5 stars.,1519430400,,153,3.4

their salt they'd have killed the target...
From now on I will avoid a Michael Madsen films...Ad nauseum...",1514678400,,241,4.148936170212766
7890819,2,6305432368,"Unenthusiastic caste likely from lame dialog.  Producers must have saved money by using grade school yearbook club members to write script and a director whose only experience must have been at a 4H summer camp.  Still, Could have been a Tarantino film if they had caste a listers spewing expletives. Save your time; you'll get more excitement out of an evening of knitting.",1514332800,,374,4.920634920634921
