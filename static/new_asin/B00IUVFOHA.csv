8645587,4,B00IUVFOHA,I love this guy's voice so much. His first album Boo-Tay - which has disappeared from everywhere - is one of the greatest CDs ever. I wish the movie had longer music segments. I wanted to hear many of the songs in full. I'm going to buy a new CD of his to support him. Have to figure out which one to start with.,1507852800,,312,3.890625
8645588,5,B00IUVFOHA,A glimpse into the realities and effort it takes to make a living as an independent artist that marches to the beat of his own drum.  With a revolving cast of backing musicians who also struggle to realize their own dreams this is life out on a limb of a very musically pure tree.  Well done.,1461369600,,292,4.196428571428571

8645591,5,B00IUVFOHA,"I enjoyed this movie and am glad I bought it. Bobby Bare Jr. seems like an interesting and uniquely-talented person I am glad to have discovered. I intend to pick up some of his music. The movie gives a good glimpse into his life, his music, and the significance of the other impressive people who are impressed by Bobby Bare Jr.",1434931200,,329,4.409836065573771

8645594,5,B00IUVFOHA,"A honest look at the life of a hard-working singer-songwriter.  Not all that glamourous when you actually care about your craft.  In the age of the Americal Idol soaked, materialist crapfest we call ""culture"" today, Bobby Bare, Jr. is my hero.  A working class hero is something to be.",1419292800,3,285,4.775510204081633
