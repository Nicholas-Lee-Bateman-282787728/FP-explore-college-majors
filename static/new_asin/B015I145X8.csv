7441678,5,B015I145X8,I bought the entire series at Walmart and I was so lucky because it hasn't been released yet. I recently watched the Flood Warning episode of this and it's good to get back into it. It brings back fond memories.,1447632000,3,211,4.3

7441681,5,B015I145X8,"At long last, all 91 episodes of The Wild Thornberrys are combined into a 15-disc DVD set, in a similar manner to the complete series of Hey Arnold just last year; 2 thick cases in a box, containing every season set and every episode of the series! If you're a space-saving nut, it's a lucky thing CatDog was only 2 normal size cases thick, and only 68 shows long, for its own complete series set. The Wild Thornberrys Movie and Rugrats Go Wild are still owned by Paramount and sold separately, if you're wondering about them. The whole series of The Wild Thornberrys is a world tour of all sorts of exotic lands and animals, starring Eliza Thornberry who's given the gift of Gab, and her family; Nigel and Marianne, her parents who run their nature show no matter where they go, her ""emo"" big sister Debbie who doesn't give a hoot about much other than boys and fashion, Donnie the wild child and stepbrother to Eliza and Debbie, and Darwin the hoity-toity chimp who found the Thornberrys. You never know where they'll go or face next, such as meeting a so-called shape-shifting dolphin/human, being stuck at sea, Debbie's shampoo-less predicament with her hair, Eliza's first crush, having holiday predicaments at Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and beyond, dealing with cousin Tyler Tucker's braggart-type antics (played by J.T.T. himself, Jonathon Taylor Thomas), and dozens of other 22-minute around-the-world adventures; all from the creators of Rugrats, AAAHH!!! Real Monsters, Duckman, and The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald. This was the first Nicktoon series to be entirely made up of 22-minute episodes; most of the others up till this only had episodes that long on special occasions, like holidays and non-holiday specials, except Kablam and Oh Yeah Cartoons, which were always variety shows. Since this is an all-in-one reissue of all its season sets, including those never seen in real stores until now, the deluxe packaging and much lower price, are the only new things about it; no bonus features at all, and not even the pilot episode, which is only 11 minutes long, according to YouTube having it! As for when the live-action Nick series Hey Dude, will be a series set in places other than Walmart and Sam's, that still remains unknown as of Easter 2016. In the meantime, Shout Factory's Nicktoon library is now entirely in series sets sold in stores AND online, now that The Wild Thornberrys just joined their ranks! Time to do the Wedgie Dance, that Donnie always loved to do!",1444176000,9,2506,4.926713947990543

7441704,5,B015I145X8,"I love animated Tv shows(from early 2000s back to the 60s) so when I saw this I bought it really just to add to my collection since I had very little memory of really liking the show when it was on tv.  That being said I couldn't be happier because I absolutely love it.  Perhaps it has a little to do with me having a dream of visiting secluded nature areas around the world and I am an animal lover, but I think it's more than that.  I think the wild thornberrys had a great combination of voice actors who worked brilliantly with each other as well as having great personalities.  They also had a mixer of episodes that kept you on your toes whereas most cartoons stick with a theme.  Take animaniacs for example they were always over the top humor you knew it was coming, Thundercats always fighting an enemy that gets the upper hand before they finally defeat him, etc.  You never knew what an episode would elicit from you, sadness in Thornberry Island, worry in Operation Valentine, hilarity in Blood Sisters, a little fear in Bogged Down, creeped out in Naimina Enkiyio, or just a relaxing enjoyment.  I also have to say the first several episodes are fairly dull, but it picks up traction quickly probably in part because the voice actors get better chemistry.  The second season is probably the best, but by the fourth season it goes down and finishes with a lame fifth season.  It's not a terrible finish, but I thought the quality within the episodes went down.  It is still a fabulous show and I like it now way more than I remember liking it which is odd because usually I remember liking shows and being slightly disappointed.  IMO Nigel was the high point in the show and probably the greatest non main character, character of all time.  Also as far as education goes, I'm not exactly sure how accurate or realistic some of the stuff is but I kid you not, I have answered a handful of questions from Jepardy solely from information I learned on the show and most of those questions no one on the show knew the answer.",1482969600,,2033,4.450134770889488

The quality is the same as Nickelodeons Avatar:The last airbender when it first came out in dvd. I do wish Nickelodeon would polish their cartoons prior to making a boxset and maybe offer it in Blu-ray. But as far as this set goes, its good, considering how long ago this show aired.
