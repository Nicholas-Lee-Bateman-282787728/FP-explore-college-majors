8739420,4,B017IT8LPG,"I didn't like the last story, because i felt the treatment of the victims was too extreme, in view of the revenge killing taking place. i myself was not clear on who was doing the torturing - the girl who had been raped many years earlier or the man seen running away from the crime scene.
The series felt 'heavier"" in the mood of the unit finding the crime performer than in the previous series. i liked the addition of the young woman to the team.",1534464000,,449,4.232558139534884

8739424,5,B017IT8LPG,"""Arne Dahl - Season 2"" is a 2015 Swedish murder mystery and detective procedural, based on the books of the Swedish crime novelist Jan Arnald, who uses the pen name Arne Dahl when writing crime fiction. There are five two-hour episodes, each of which is based on a separate crime novel by Jan Arnald. The story line centers around the activities of the A Unit, a highly-specialized team of Swedish homicide detectives tasked with investigating and solving a series of challenging and high-profile murder cases. In this second season, after having been disbanded two years earlier due to insufficient funding, the A Unit is now being reactivated, with new leadership and several new team members, in response to a wave of brutal murders that have recently been perpetrated in Sweden. ""Arne Dahl"" features an intelligent and intriguing story line, interesting and likable characters, and the dark and foreboding Nordic Noir. Arne Dahl is a decidedly intelligent, intriguing, and suspenseful murder mystery and detective procedural series, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. This second season of ""Arne Dahl"" continues to feature superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1522022400,3,1314,5.352657004830918
