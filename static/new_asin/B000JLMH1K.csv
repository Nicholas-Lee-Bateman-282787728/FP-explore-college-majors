Movie divided in three sections.  In the first section, Mr. Moretti cruises around various neighborhoods in Rome on his motor scooter sharing his offbeat observations.  In the second section, Moretti explores the Italian Islands with his friend looking for a quiet place to write -  encountering family and characters along the way.  The final section shares Moretti's personal health issues including chemotherapy, a rash that won't go away and the loads of medical solutions offered up by the medical establishment.  This movie has beautiful Italian scenery and I felt like I was on a slow walk on a breezy day in Italy - experiencing what Italians see and feel each day.",1209772800,2,740,4.935483870967742
