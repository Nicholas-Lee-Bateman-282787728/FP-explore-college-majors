7925618,1,B00004WLY4,"This video was made 15 years ago, so it's funny to watch the guy show you the maintenance of a ""mountain bike""- it's more like a communte bike in today's standard. The pros explain the technic in a very unnatural way and the lousy camera man made them look even worse. Not much you can learn from the riding scenes and the given advise, maybe 10 minutes out of the whole time is educational. The last part shows some good BMX tricks and that guy is awesome, however, it's not Mountain Biking! There are not too many videos out there teaching you how to ride properly, but go get Ned Overand's ""Performance Mountain Biking"". Don't waste money and time on this one.",1071187200,,663,4.442622950819672
7925619,5,B00004WLY4,"This video was produced back in the early days of mountain biking when race promoters served chili and beer after the races, and when mountain bikers shared a special camaraderie.  Remember, this was 1989, the early days.  This is the second mountain bike video ever produced (the first was ""The Great Mountain Biking Video"" which features Ned Overend.)  The featured pros, who helped bring mountain biking into the scope of national attention, put their ""advanced techniques and winning strategies"" into their own words.  Take it from someone who rides a mountain bike three times a week -- in actual mountains:  Maybe the equipment has changed (full shock systems, clipless pedals, etc.) but riding techniques have not.  This video won a Houston International Film & TV Festival Award, the International Film & TV Festival of New York Award, and a Silver Telly.  ""Ultimate"" features  Tinker Juarez, Cindy Whitehead, Jim Deaton, Glen Adams, John Howard, Margaret Day and Ot Pi - riders who literally gave their blood, sweat and tears to bring mountain biking to the world.  This video is a true classic and belongs in the video library of any true mountain biker.",1054512000,,1164,5.020833333333333
7925620,1,B00004WLY4,"This was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. It was suppossed to be an instructional video, but what little bit of actual instruction there was is virtually useless. It showed a few sequences of the pros riding, followed by them reading from a teleprompter some useless instructions of how to accomplish the technique. If you like being bored to tears and wasting your money, then buy this video, otherwise, I would recommend Ned Overend's video ""Performance Mountain Biking"" or ""West Coast Style"" for the more extreme techniques.",1036886400,2,538,5.056179775280899
