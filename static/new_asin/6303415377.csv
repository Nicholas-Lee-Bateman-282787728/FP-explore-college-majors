7846947,5,6303415377,Bought this movie in 1995 and have watched numerous times loaning it often to friends. It truly is a mystical journey that you can just get captured into. Now 20 yrs later afraid to loan or hardly play it  since the tape is old. Please can someone make this movie on dvd for us that are fans. Newer films with scenes that would seem similar doesn't hold a candle to Third Stone from the Sun.,1436400000,,391,4.213333333333333
7846948,3,6303415377,Reviews lead me to believe this was something other than what it is. My fault for buying it.,1425772800,,92,4.166666666666667
7846949,5,6303415377,"I first saw this movie on HBO maybe 12 years ago. At that moment I was hooked to New Age music, specially from Narada Records, so when I began to listen to listen to artists that were some of my favorite (David Lanz, David Arkenstone and others)I just got caught by the movie. I serched when it was scheduled again and recorded it on VHS. One of the great things of this movie is how well images of great landscapes and music fit so well. Each landscape is of so beautiful. It's a pitty it is not on DVD",1210723200,3,503,4.090909090909091
7846950,5,6303415377,"Third Stone from the Sun is a very nice change from all the stealing, killing, lying and sex in all movies.

The problem is, no one has put this beautiful creation on DVD.

As you know, Beta and VHF players are out dated.

Someone get the company to put this great movie on DVD.

The price will go up, but this movie is well worth the price.

Our world is changing. This maybe the best record for future  generation to see how beautiful the Earth really is.",1137283200,6,457,4.195402298850575
7846951,5,6303415377,"This scarce film was originally sold at Radio Shack.  They used it to demonstrate their TV's because unlike the normal 18 frames per second, this was filmed at a higher speed (24 frames?).  Consequently, when water splashes, you see every drop.  Rich music and only a smattering of dialog, the story is of an exta-terrestial child who's planet is doomed so he's been sent to search for a new world.  A white Schooner guided by a spirit helper shows him the great Northwest.  Sometimes I'll watch the film with the volume off and substitute music of my own. Maybe one of the most unusual films you'll ever see and one of the few you'll watch over and over again.",1041552000,5,661,4.5210084033613445
