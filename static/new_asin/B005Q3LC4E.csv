8482868,2,B005Q3LC4E,This is a cute movie but this copy is obviously a dub of a dub of a dub of a dub.  The picture quality looks more like an animated Monet painting....the picture just is not clear.  The sound quality is good though.  I would not purchase this unless you are in to being disappointed with online purchases.,1366156800,3,304,4.298245614035087
