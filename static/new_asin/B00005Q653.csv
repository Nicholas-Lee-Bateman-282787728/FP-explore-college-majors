7949765,5,B00005Q653,excellent if you want to know how code breaking helped win the war and shows the incredible efforts that the allies put into determining the enemies plans. It should also act as a warning the codes are unbreakable,1383782400,2,213,4.631578947368421
7949766,5,B00005Q653,The history of code breaking is extremely interesting. What is more interesting is the mathematical genius behind creating these code. It's a wonder they could be broken.
