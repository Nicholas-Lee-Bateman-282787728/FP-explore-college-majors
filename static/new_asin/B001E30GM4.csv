8296168,5,B001E30GM4,"I received a copy of this film from the Director when he premiered it at a film festival and friends of mine who've watched it have wanted their own copies too. It looks as if this film was made due to the criticisms of various religious leaders of politicians who have run for public office in the past. One of those being John F. Kennedy (Catholic) and more recently Mitt Romney (Mormon). The director of the film speaks with many religious leaders, attorneys and constitutional experts to better understand their points of views and beliefs. One thing I took away from watching this film is how many religions are misunderstood. Many of the religious leaders interviewed in this film don't know a thing about other faiths and some don't even care to learn about the beliefs of others. They speak badly of them even. So many people like to stay within their bubbles and not seek to understand those around them, keeping a closed minded view on everything. This is a huge problem in our society. I think we need to do as this film suggests. Learn about those around us, keep an open mind and love them regardless of our differences.",1305158400,,1133,4.6138613861386135
