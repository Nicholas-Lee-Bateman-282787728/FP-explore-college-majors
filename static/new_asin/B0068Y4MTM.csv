4979444,3,B0068Y4MTM,"A more suitable title would have been ATTACK OF THE ALCOHOLIC ZOMBIES, since the film takes a much more critical look at the effects of alcoholism than it does on meat-eating. After years of failed crops, a desperate wife turns to witchcraft to revive the grape harvest for her struggling husband. The vines return, but the juice from their fruit transforms all who drink it in to winethirsty zombies who attack anyone that has had a drink! VEGAN ZOMBIES' goofy B-movie plot compliments the title, but is derailed by the seriousness of the acting and filming. It has trouble deciding if it is a silly spoof or a socially conscious metaphor, especially when it shares just as many thematic links with NIGHT OF THE LIVING as it does with TROLL 2. Townsend makes the most of his inexperienced actors, colorful settings, and ambitious camera work, which borrows generously from genre classics like THE EVIL DEAD. A lighter tone and increased vegan zombie action would have benefited this small film, but for the budget, it makes a valid effort at creating something unique and significant that Indie Horror fans are sure to enjoy.

4979447,4,B0068Y4MTM,"I consider myself an avid cinefile, however, there are crater sized holes in my viewing history. The films of Pedro Almodvar and Zombie films are two of my greatest deficiencies. I spent 2009 working towards a respectable knowledge of Zombie films, but many of them seemed too slick - fast zombies with high production value, comedies wrenched from gore splattered premises, post-apocalyptic scenarios too farfetched for me to suspend my disbelief. The Zombie films I enjoyed all seemed to hearken back to Romero's original whose craftsmanship indicated that perhaps actual Zombies were part of the filmmaking process. The lower budget Zombie films seemed more adept at my belief in Zombie lore and more creative. ""Attack of the Vegan Zombies"" has that wonderful grass roots quality to it. Ominous and unsettling, at times this film feels like a 1970s hard-to-categorize film. The distinct vineyard setting, the undercurrent of the ravishes of alcoholism, and the stoic quality of the lead actor all lead one to wonder, ""What is this film about?"" For those who eschew airplane movies and Hollywood cranked-out crap, ""Attack of the Vegan Zombies"" is a stagger in the right direction. The directorial debut of Jim Townsend may have some imperfections but the true zombie of the film world is the dearth of original thought - I found ""Attack of the Vegan Zombies"" all together human and certainly worth watching.",1266796800,3,1409,5.130434782608695

Anytime you pair killer plants with a spoof, its going to be good -- just remember Killer Tomatoes people, need I say more?

There are several key scenes where you wonder to yourself if they are serious or joking, but they really do mean to be funny all the way around. The acting is great for the genre it's in, you can tell that people put a lot of hard work into the movie. All of these people deserve to move up in the world of acting -- they fake bad acting and seriousness all at the same time, it makes for an extremely good laugh.

The scenery and setting were really good and he really created a creepy setting out of a vineyard.  In one scene, which reminded me of Creepshow 2 (in a good way) two girls sunbathing by a less than impressive looking lake as approached by a floating mass of vines in a surprisingly frightening moment.  A great shot that made the most out of zero special effects.  But sadly that wasn't enough to save the film.  The concept of killer grapes that turn people in alcoholic zombies just didn't work.  I commend the writers for thinking outside the box, but it just came off as silly.  But the film was never silly enough to be a comedy and never scary enough to be a horror.  The zombies in this film were really not zombies (vampires with green skin would be a better description) and their motivation (drinking the blood of humans in an attempt to get some of the alcohol in their blood) just comes off as contrived.  Also, although there are some surprisingly good actors in this film (Christine Egan, who played the heroine, did a great job) the bad actors sadly overwhelm her.

4979464,3,B0068Y4MTM,"When a married couple's farm produces ANOTHER year's worth of bad crop for producing the wine they make and live by the wife, Dionne goes to her mother who is a witch. While she has turned her back on the ancient craft that flows naturally through her family she has her mother help her cast a spell to help save the next year's crop so they don't have to either move or lose their vinyard. Wine? Witches? Where are the undead?

Well instead of the usual science and classic voodoo we are used to on where the zombies come from we have them created from witchcraft gone wild. (I'm pretty sure that was also the name of a bad porno.) Basically the ritual used required human blood and the husbands was volunteered without his knowledge. The problem was Joe was drinking that night and the alcohol in his blood may have caused a problem, though the crop did seem to come in quite well. With the successful crop the couple ""hire"" one of their friends who is a teacher to hire a few of his students to work on the last of the crop while they take a break. A teacher, 2 geeks, and 2 women show up to help out and its clearly setup themed off of classic B movies everywhere to show us who exactly are going to have issues.

I do have to warn you that while it has some classic B-Movie scenes to it you are going to be watching an independent film while you see it and it absolutely shows through. Some of the acting and editing is a bit painful but overall enjoyable regardless. It follows the B-Movie horror genre in so many aspects it's exactly what you you'd expect. There is a clear cut explanation on why there is first no cell phone service and later when they are required to be cut off from civilization why the phones are out. While many B-Movies are happy to show off the full female frontal I do warn those who are used to the abundance of nudity in standard B-movies you only get one scene. While the picking of the grapes starts out going fine the error in the spell soon brings forward the true problem - the vines have become alive and want the wine they are making. Yes the vegan aspect starts here but gets so much worse as it will drain the blood of any who have had the wine to reclaim the alcohol it wants so badly.

Magic safety tip: Don't use blood full of alcohol when casting spells.

So how do the vines drain the blood from these people? If you've seen the first Evil Dead movie (and if you haven't stop right here and buy it immediately) you'll remember how the trees went around and attacked people. Think of this as the exact same thing aside from vines that the grapes grow on (and no attempted plant / human rape.) When they have finished with their snack they turn the humans into zombies of a sort. Zombies that are literally green from now being part plant. Here's a geek reference for you - Star Trek the original series alien women green. It's almost a little too distracting but with the hinted at plant explanation you can buy the lack of what we are used to for zombie makeup and run with it. I'm not going to lie to you and say this is one of the best films of all time to get. I am going to tell you though if you can deal with an obvious independent film that is going for that B-Movie feel you should get a kick out of it. The Evil Dead styled plants are classic, the lesbian scene is sadly not long enough, and most importantly there is a scene with what reminds me of a meat grinder (clearly something for making wine but I couldn't begin to guess what it is.) Overall that is exactly what it is - A fun film that could have used a bit more production money to really polish it up to be a great B-Movie.",1348963200,3,3642,4.206008583690987

4979467,4,B0068Y4MTM,"Attack of the Vegan Zombies seemingly ignores the very nature of the zombie as a flesh-feaster, yet somehow pulls off a fine Indie horror film.

Synopsis:
Joe (Jim Townsend) is a struggling vineyard owner who can't catch a break. Bad weather, dry soil and other hindrances, both explainable and unexplainable, prevent him from having a good grape harvest and realizing his dream of a good life in the country. His loving and supportive wife Dionne (Christine Egan) does her best to be supportive and encourage her husband, but it's no use... Joe is ready to give it all up and takes solace in liquor, though he gave it up years ago.

Dionne, not one to whither away like a raisin on the vine, decides to take matters into her own hand and consults her mother (H. Lynn Smith), a witch from way back. Dionne too, complains mother, also has ""the gift"" and foolishly decided to turn her back on the old ways and go for the life of a vineyard owner's wife - but that doesn't stop her from helping her daughter cast a powerful spell to encourage the grapes to flourish and save the vineyard. Just a bit of blood from the now passed-out Joe and the spell is complete.

The next year the vines are lush, packed with grapes bursting with juice, and it appears that a happy ending is in store... but the vines seem to have a mind of their own and will stop at nothing to quench their unearthly thirst.

Thoughts:
Everything about Attack of the Vegan Zombies is all wrong, right from the start. Just the concept of a vegan zombie is just stupid, and zombie aficionados wouldn't be criticized for turning their back from the beginning... but wait. Believe it or not, Attack of the Vegan Zombies actually works, and manages to make the unlikely concept fit acceptably within both Wiccan sensibility AND zombie lore. Not only that, but the camp is acceptably applied so as to lead one to believe that this is an actual horror movie rather than a silly farce. Plus the digs on vegans were particularly satisfying, especially for an avowed meat-eater.

From a cinematic standpoint Attack of the Vegan Zombies is a pure success, mastering the elements of sound quality and cinematography that are often so elusive to those who create micro-budget Indie horror. The filming and sound are both gorgeous and add to the feel of a quality entry to the genre. The story is very strong and, actually somewhat believable for the most part; the story element is often the strongpoint of the Indie horror scene, and Attack of the Vegan Zombies is no exception. This film was undoubtedly made with love and respect for horror.

The performances of the actors are generally very good, especially Christine Egan as the hesitant witch. Most of the other characters are over-acted caricatures of real human beings, but for some reason that is not bothersome in this case. Well, the nerdy guys who come to pick grapes are especially overdone to the point that it is annoyingly noticeable in some parts, but the guys managed to win the viewer's hearts over time. Writer/Director Jim Townsend is a little flat in his performance, but again, not to the detriment of the film. The girl-on-girl action more than makes up for it.

I had decided before watching Attack of the Vegan Zombies that I was not going to like it. As a self-proclaimed ""zombie guy"" the whole concept was just too much to consider, but this film won me over soundly. Be prepared for some silly camp along with vines lurking around the grounds, but you can still settle in for a good time with this film. Of all of the Indie horror I watch, this is one of those rare productions that I have shown again to friends. That's saying something.

I needed to bullet point that, because i spent most of the movie questioning what i was hearing. These two cheerleaders are trying to earn money and drink wine, so they are there to be stereotypes, and so are the two nerd boys, who are so overdone it's painful to watch.
The lead Dionne is actually a great actress, so i think that's why i kept watching. Dionne is desperate to save the winery since it was her fathers.

8495022,3,B0068Y4MTM,"Love bad movies. Love zombie movies. It's not campy enough for the 1st, and just (barely) qualifies as a zombie movie. This is a student's idea of a zombie movie. Beware the Nickelodeon Goop!",1453593600,,191,4.647058823529412

8495024,2,B0068Y4MTM,"This movie was not at all what I expected. I thought that it was going to be a campy movie with the silly premise but it appears they wanted this to be a serious horror film. Either way, it didn't work. Realizing that all zombie movies have flaws in the plot this one had too many to mention. How did the grapevines move around?  Why couldn't a fine healthy man outrun a plant? How did the vines become alcoholics? Why couldn't Endora just cast another spell? I have a goal of watching every zombie movie and Hulu, Amazon and Netflix otherwise I would have skipped it halfway through.(I know that it not a very ambitious goal)",1447804800,,626,4.396551724137931
8495025,1,B0068Y4MTM,"This is not good at all! I am laughing at myself that I watched it through, that is probably the only funny part. Zombie's shouldn't talk or think, painting one green and having them converse with their victims was crazy! The nerds got on my nerves watching their forced nerd acting. The only slightly interesting part was the last 15 min, but still that wasn't good. I thought being a vegan this might be funny, but stick with the walking dead.",1446336000,,445,4.506172839506172
