2377586,3,B000A796SA,"I love Bollywood workouts and own many. When I got this dvd I was dissapointed. I really don't see this being ""bollywood dance"" I can see where it could be inspired by bollywood like the mudra and such but if you are looking to dance like a bollywood movie, this isn't the dvd.
You get your heart rate up fast when they start the dancing because you just right into it learning the moves as you go but then once you learn the last move you don't go through the dance all the way it just cuts to the strengthening section. The cardio could have lasted longer, a lot longer.
If your looking for a dance dvd where you don't learn any real moves just are told when to raise your hands stomp your feet and spin this is for you.
If you don't like cheesy faces and overdramatics avoid it because the blonde girl on the right will annoy you to insanity!",1235260800,,845,4.190184049079755

It has a short warm-up section with Yoga Booty Ballet's signature mudra and intention-setting.  Then it's off to the cardio which gets your heart pumping.  The choreography is a little tricky but having a little challenge makes it all the more rewarding once you ""get it.""  There are a few turns, some bellydance type moves, scooting, etc.  It's very high energy and the instructors are enthusiastic without being overly-perky and annoying.  It helps to have resistance bands for the sculpting section but they aren't absolutely necessary.  I liked the sculpting because you do moves intended to tone the thighs which is my problem area.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It is highly unique and very fun.",1201305600,2,973,6.148148148148148
2377588,5,B000A796SA,"I've only done it once so far and enjoyed it. I know from experience with some of their other themed dances that once you've done it a few times you get more out of it.  Definitely well researched and executed.  I'm glad I bought this one, as I expect it to enhance my fitness routine.",1197331200,2,285,4.163636363636364
2377589,5,B000A796SA,"I got this DVD after trying the basic Yoga Booty package and loved it.  The video gives you exactly what the title describes, a Bollywood Style workout.  It is wrong to expect a bellydance style workout from this video.  True, many moves from bollywood style dance numbers are borrowed from bellydance, but bollywood dance is distinctly different from bellydancing.  The instructors have done their research well, and have created a nice workout with bhangra, dance and yoga. The steps you see in this video are the same steps you would see at an Indian wedding.  I loved this DVD and use it again and again.",1174867200,12,608,4.752380952380952
2377590,4,B000A796SA,"This was my introduction to the yoga booty ballet experience. I absolutely loved it. You get a great workout.

  The only thing I would have liked better is if after they were done teaching you the cardio bollywood workout instead of just starting the cooldown & strengthening they actually ran you through the complete dance routine 2 or 3 times. You spend all that time learning the moves and putting them together and when you finally learn them all they stop & go straight to strengthening. The only place I'm gonna do these moves is in my living room while the dvd is on so I felt a little ripped off that they didn't go through the entire routine at the end a few times.  Despite that you get an awesome workout.

THIS DVD IS DEFINATELY WORTH THE CALORIES BURNED!!!!  GREAT PURCHASE!",1149379200,19,789,4.52112676056338
2377591,3,B000A796SA,"This is another video from the Yoga Booty Ballet Live series; each workout in this series contains dancey cardio, a toning segment, and some yoga-inspired stretches/breathing/meditation.  Instructors Gillian and Teigh teach live in front of a large studio class, leading in a tag team style, and Ravi the live drummer is ever-present. The entire workout clocks in at about 34 minutes.

As with the other YBB Live videos, Bollywood begins in a seated position for some breathing work and setting your intention for the practice.  I particularly liked that you start the warm-ups in this position, using flowing arm movements to loosen your chest and shoulders.  You then do a little stylized turn to move to a standing position and continue with the same types of flowing movements; you'll also preview some of the moves featured in the cardio portion.

As the name of the video implies, the cardio here is supposedly inspired by Bollywood-style movies.  In general, I found the movements to be nicely flowing and fun to do, but the choreography was more difficult for me to follow than in the other YBBs I've tried (Hip Hop Abs, Go Go).  Gillian and Teigh do perform extra repetitions to help you learn the movements, but there are some tricky, quick transitions that just make the routine a bit hard to follow.  Another issue I had is that several of the movements have a left-side focus (eg, the stomp and hip drop), and they are repeatedly performed on that side of the body only, which left me feeling uneven.  Despite these issues, I did actually enjoy the cardio routine, but I was disappointed that my heart rate never got into my target zone even though I felt I was putting a lot of effort into the workout.

Gillian and Teigh have a habit of stopping the cardio portion rather abruptly mid-way through the routine (about 15 minutes total), and Bollywood is no exception.  They then tell you to get a band and a yoga mat (you don't really need the latter though) for the sculpting portion, which consists of about 6 minutes of standing work.  They use the band to add upper body work to lower body exercises such as squats and lunges and also to isolate muscles such as the biceps and tricpes; this section was okay, but I'm not sure how much I got out of it.  The final 4 minutes of the workout feature stretches performed on the floor, first with the band and then without, which provided a nice little end to the workout.

Although I found this video to be somewhat enjoyable, I didn't feel very worked out by the end, so I'm not sure how much use I will get out of it.  It could be that there is a ""learning curve"" to the routine, so I will give it another try; I could see keeping this in reserve for when I don't feel like doing anything else.  If you like the YBB Live series and are looking for a fun, light workout, this may be for you.",1141430400,26,2854,4.523346303501945

They are fun and upbeat and I have enjoyed exercising with their DVD's.  The time flies by and you can't believe you are done!

8075394,5,B000A796SA,"I have to say that I was an intermediate exerciser before my second pregnancy. Once I had my son I felt I was more a beginners level. I started working out again when he was 7 months old. I wanted something not too hard and fun. This fit the bill. I love yoga in general, and this gives me some yoga, meditation, cardio, and toning, all delivered in a very fun way!!!!!! Teigh and Gill are great instructors and easy to follow. I am so glad I found Yoga Booty Ballet! Even though the workouts are a bit old they are excellent. Very different from what I am used to do (Cathe, Slim series, 10 minute trainer, 10 days to a better body, Tracy Anderson, etc.)
I recommend all of the YBB dvds!!!!!!",1369008000,,693,4.2180451127819545
8075395,5,B000A796SA,"I hate exercising- but this DVD is so fun that I can't help but love doing it! I bought this DVD in 2008 and STILL put it to good use 4 years later! It's a light work out, but it gets you moving.  Also, you get out what you put in.  Exaggerate the moves and you'll burn way more calories!",1347753600,,288,3.783333333333333
8075396,4,B000A796SA,I already knew I love Teigh and Gillian and their ideas and concepts. I love this workout because it is not too long yet I feel it each time I do the workout. The dancing is fun and different being sort of belly dancish. The resistance makes you feel it without turning your arms into jello for the day. Overall a great addition to my YBB library.,1302220800,,347,4.1940298507462686
8075397,1,B000A796SA,"I'm flabbergasted by the positive reviews for this! It's, literally, the WORST workout DVD I've ever bought. There's zero explanation about the moves, the cueing happens when the moves are already happening (after no demonstrating the moves, either). The thing is, the instructors KNOW it's bad, as they're always saying ""Don't worry, you're learning! We'll do this a thousand more times until you understand it."" They should have made the workout longer and spent time actually explaining the moves. Luckily I bought this at a used bookstore. I'm tossing it straight in the trash.",1294185600,3,581,5.191489361702128
