8019822,5,B00020X8Y8,"Bill Holt (John Miljan) is a famous detective. He is on vacation and borrowing a house on Glen Athol. He is invited and practically forced to go to a party in the mansion next door. A wickedly flirtatious girl Muriel Randel (Iris Adrian) tells him of all the skeletons in everyone's closet. She seems to be some sort of scamp that uses everyone including the detective. It seems to be an early night as the detective goes home to finish a book he is writing. The scamp is exhausted and goes to bead early. All is well.

Bang! Bang! Shots heard. That night the butler mistakes a nephew (guest) of being a burglar and shoots him. Soon other bodies are found and the simple minded police pin it on the nephew. Our detective without overtly playing his hand must find out the truth.

Be sure to concentrate on the first 10 minute introduction of the characters or you will get lost in the shuffle.

Watching many detective movies it is not hard to guess the whole story as it is thinly masked and hurried at 69 minutes. However it is fun to watch the story unfold before our eyes and a rather refreshing but not unique conclusion.

The film has the feel that we are coming in in the middle of a series. However there is no reference to a book or any other movie either this character. The Writer of the screen play, John W. Krafft, has a string of credits to his name for many other movies and TV series.",1505433600,32,1400,4.3320610687022905

8019824,4,B00020X8Y8,"My mom and I love old movies, especially mystery movies. My great great aunt is Irene Ware, so we where very excited to find this movie with her in it!

My one advice is to pay close attention to who all the characters are or you will get lost very quickly!

The DVD itself was in perfect shape.",1459296000,,295,4.068965517241379
8019825,4,B00020X8Y8,"A well-known detective receives a forced invitation to a party from his pushy neighbors.  He'd rather stay home and try his hand at writing a book instead.  Unfortunately, his neighbors don't understand the concept of no thank you.  Soon, he's embroiled in murders, blackmail, a missing necklace, and gangsters.  There's a car chase, a shootout, and several bodies too many.  Happily, the character that deserves to die, does.  The police are corrupt and not too bright.  Things move along at a brisk pace.  A light touch is used throughout.  It's actually quite good for the period.  The transfer leaves a lot to be desired (vertical white stripes are the worst of the visual destruction from age).  Otherwise, it's absorbing and fun.",1442275200,,735,4.991735537190083

8019827,2,B00020X8Y8,"""Murder at Glen Athol"" is a routine Poverty Row murder mystery, in a typically bad Alpha Video print - washed out and scratchy, wtih plenty of reel change marks.  It would be useful for showing someone what bad B&W TV reception was like, back in the analog days. To me, the movie had only a few points of interest, listed below, which probably include SPOILERS.

-Although both Amazon and the IMDB date it to 1936, it seems older: the character of Colletti is a bootlegger (Repeal was in 1933) and the few cars that are seen look older, and seem to have been shot silent - although they could be stock footage from an older movie.

-Iris Adrian, as the perky Muriel, is the best thing in the picture even though her dialog contains cubic yards of exposition - but she vanishes very early on.

-Irene Ware (Miss USA of 1926!) is, to me, nothing special, and is given the worst clothes and hair in the movie.

-Ridiculous moment 1: The hero and his faithful companion are driving home when they realize they are being pursued by gangsters. Faithful companion asks if the hero wants to shoot it out with them. Hero replies, ""No, I have a better idea"" - which turns out to consist of pulliing over, getting out of the car, and shooting at the gangsters as they drive by.

-Ridiculous moment 2: The hero calls all the surviving characters together for a big announcement, which he intends to be the solution to the mystery.  However, at the get-together, another character announces a solution - which the hero decides to accept!  When then asked what he called the meeting for, the hero blandly announces that he and Miss Ware will be getting married (the very next day, too) despite never having made the slightest suggestion of it to her earlier!  But in the very next scene, they are on their honeymoon.

-The musical score is conspicuous by its complete absence.

Despite some of the above, I cannot recommend this movie.  It is ugly, dumb, and mostly dull.  Even of its type, there are much better time-passers out there - for example, ""The Death Kiss"", which has a far more interesting locale and cast.",1305763200,2,2104,4.578666666666667
8019828,4,B00020X8Y8,Very good early murder mystery.  The DVD by Alpha is a pretty decent print with a minimum of splicing.  I especially enjoyed the part played by Iris Adrian.,1243814400,8,156,4.535714285714286
