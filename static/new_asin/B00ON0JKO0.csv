8684321,3,B00ON0JKO0,"People watch this because it is the archetypal mid-period Rainer Werner Fassbinder film, and forget that it was made for entertainment or at least a psychological presentation. If you are looking for Fassbinder a much better presentation is Welt am Draht or World on a Wire 1973.

The characters speak slow enough and clear enough that any German you may have picked up in school is clear and not slurred. I still had to use subtitles for some words but ignored them for the most part because who ever wrote the subtitles transliterated in stead of word for word (and it can drive you up the wall.) Subtitles: Peter + Waltraut Green.

Even though there is music it is not a constant background noise that drowns out the voices. The closing scene is also done to music.

There is a feel of a T.V. production rather than an art film. It is a little coisotropic as it is all indoors. Notice only women; I suspect the same of the cats.

The film has that 1972 everyone smokes problem. Luckily this production only has a gratuity light-up.

I watched the Criterion version with all the extras. The Extras (German with English subtitles) help explain what Fassbinder is trying to be portray. Then you can go back and watch the movie again.",1528329600,,1233,4.586363636363636
8684322,4,B00ON0JKO0,"I was unprepared for a movie that transpired completely in an apartment. Yet, the film was well done and was psychologically and emotionally dramatic. The English subtitles were good.",1518739200,,183,5.344827586206897

8684324,4,B00ON0JKO0,"We follow the shifts in power among a successful fashion designer (Margit Carstensen) and the two women in her life.  Marlene (Irm Hermann) is a silent fellow designer who allows herself to be treated like a slave, and Karin (Hanna Schygulla) is a fresh young model with a tragic past that has not deepened her character.

Director Rainer Werner Fassbinder is eager to communicate his ideas about the relationship between power and love, but he does so without much subtlety.  As foreshadowed by its title, the whole thing is very melodramatic.  As unfair and reductive as it may be to say so, for me it often came off as a Very Earnest Director making a Grand Statement with makeup and mannequins.  However, it was intermittently effective with some scenes of real emotional power, culminating in a final scene that is surreal, funny, and devastating.",1463184000,4,852,4.888888888888889
8684325,5,B00ON0JKO0,"This is truely a masterpies for no doubt at all.
I still remember seeing Fasbinder's other film <The Marriage of Maria Braun>. After seeing the ending, I was just literally freezed and couldn't moved for at least 5 minutes. It was just a truely shocking!
And now almost 15 years has been passed and I've got this 9 disc collection of Fasbinder that is only about 12$ from UK amazon and that include this movie.
This movie is first attached my attention because of the artwork and the camera work.
The art work is all sexual. The wall is painted with nudity of a man naked with his peanuts shown and a woman also naked. The manequins are all so very real looking that are all skin toned naked figures. All this things make the mood of the only location of this movie very erotic.
As you can see this movie is about Petra von Kant who is just divorced and falls in love with another woman who is her model the 23 old lady Karin.

The camera work is truely amazing. It sometimes frames like this.
The two naked manequins are on the two edge side of each left and right while two women are talking on the middle side about sex and stuff. It truely make the mood more erotic that way.
And When also two woman are talking about awkwad way of sex, the camera is tightly moving to the secreraty on the backside typing and suddenly focuses out to her and moves back to Petra von Kant on the right side front. It clearly shows that the secretary maybe has been involved with Petra as well. See, the secretary never speaks as if she is a mute. She works like a slave, whenever Petra tells her, she does whatever she asks her to do like a maid or something. Petra even shouts at her whenever she feels like she wants to. She never complains or shows any signs of discomfort at all.

The whole relationship thing is very interesting in this movie as well.

Peter Von Kant the owner of the Apartment is kind of powerful woman but since her model/ lover Karin comes and live with her, she becomes her (kind of) slavish woman. she gives her money, love and even do whatever she asks, for instance when she tells her I want a wine, she gives her a glass of wine which she never did before. She always used her secratary before.
Also Karin is a free woman who sleeps with othe man whatever she wants to even if she is in love with Petra. That makes Petra pisses off.

Then the mutish secretary. A mistary woman who is kind of slavish lady. She never speaks and do whatever Peter asks her to do. Constantly work-typs as a secretary. At the end when Karin leaves Petra and Petra becomes sick for a while and recovers from sick, then she kind of overcomes not being with her lover Karin she tells the secretary Martene that you are free now. This indicate that she was kind of a slave before. IT is the word YOU ARE FREE NOW that makes her able to go out from the apartment.

Then there is Petra's daughter who is kind of dependent girl.
And her mother who is all about her happiness.

See all the people appear in this movie are female only that is also interesting.

The movie ends as I mentioned before when Petra releases the secretary Martene free and she packs her stuff and leaves the apartment.

The whole story is only happening in the apartment and mostly in the bed. But I never felt a single minute boring.
This is an amazing film next to his other film <The Marriage of Maria Braun>.
You should check it out.
I am so blessed purchasing the 9 disc collection of Fasbinder. Now I have chance to see 8 more movies of his.

PS: I forgot to mention that the cinematography was done by Michael Ballhaus.",1461110400,4,3589,4.289512555391433
8684326,5,B00ON0JKO0,"A profound minimalist piece of film-making made on the humblest of budgets, but it doesn't look it. Michael Ballhaus's photography is exceptionally good and it really shines on this new Criterion Blu-Ray. Definitely ranks amongst Fassbinder's greatest achievements.",1448236800,3,265,6.0
8684327,5,B00ON0JKO0,"Fassbinder's best, probably?  If you like the bitter battle of women together, you'll have a ball with this.  Fassbinder really understands women's motivations. The color, the dialogue pits against your senses.  The animal cruelty staggering.
Great transfer.  Not for the fainthearted.",1444089600,5,285,5.878048780487805

8684329,4,B00ON0JKO0,"Very strong film. The color is VERY vivid -- think Black Narcissus; think Red Shoes too -- and the photography and art direction and the direction itself very striking. But what makes the film remarkable is a very intelligent, perceptive script. The characters say earthy things that are in contrast to the framing and composition of shots. And a great final scene with Marlene.

Put this film on expecting nothing, you will be surprised and impressed. Well worth the two hours.",1423267200,21,478,4.901234567901234
