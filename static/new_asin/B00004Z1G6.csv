7927920,2,B00004Z1G6,Disappointing image quality. Was only in the French language with a non disconnectable English subtitles (very distracting).,1467936000,,124,6.352941176470588
7927921,4,B00004Z1G6,"A young tour guide is spotted as the unknown son of a
famous dead New Wave film maker.  While he's skeptical at first, he never did know
his own father, so who knows?

And suddenly a world of artists, actresses,  etc. open
up to him, as he `finds' himself in what might be a complete fiction.

This garnered critical reaction all over the spectrum, though mostly positive, some raving.  I'll go
with funny and clever, but I'm not sure I buy it as the deep work of art that some see.
Still, I'd be happy to re-visit.

As for the transfer, I agree with the other reviewer that it was far from optimal, but
found it good enough that I could still enjoy the film.  I've seen a lot worse!",1309824000,,683,4.207692307692308
7927922,1,B00004Z1G6,This is an amusing film with many cameos from well-known French film stars.  Unfortunately Fox Lorber continues in their tradition of releasing substandard DVDs.  The transfer is horribly blurry and the subtitles are burned into the print and not removable.  Order at your own risk.,1009238400,12,282,5.222222222222222
