8508637,2,B0071VDX5A,I really like Lawrence Tierney and enjoy this movie but the region 2 version of this film has permanent spanish subtitles plastered across the screen even though the menu clearly has an option to watch without subtitles. The menu is defective and having spanish subtitles ruin the picture when watching a movie in english absolutely ruins the dvd.,1451520000,5,347,5.0
8508638,2,B0071VDX5A,There are two different ways to turn off the Spanish subtitles for this film and neither of them work. Love the movie but with the subtitles splashed across the screen it ruins this dvd for me. Pay good money and get a defective product. What else is new.,1451088000,6,255,4.333333333333333
