1379521,4,B00004YZEL,"Early in John Woo's career as a director in Hong Kong, he had the auspiciousness to direct three of the seven fortunes in Yuen Biao, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung in their first movie together Hand of Death (1976: Chinese Title literally means Shaolin Gate) though much was not made of this at the time because they were all struggling to make a career. They have yet to work together again in such a capacity though they have said nothing but kind words about each other since.  An interesting point, in hindsight, is that the star of the film is none of the three (it is hard to spot Yuen Biao as his role is of a stunt double and bit actor) but Korean export and Tae Kwon Do expert Dorian Tan Tao-Liang.

Dorian Tan Tao-Liang stars as Yun Fei a Shaolin trained fighter looking to find Zhang Yi (John Woo) and escort him through White Stone town and across the White River. Zhang holds a map of all Qing bases in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in southeast China.  He can get a hold of Zhang by contacting pupil Chiu Guo.  However, when he is found, he has already been arrested and ready to be beheaded by the Manchus led by a traitor of the Shaolin Shih Xiaofeng (ubiquitous bad guy James Tien: Fearless Hyena, Winners and Sinners) who has taught himself White Crane Soul Chaser Style (he is the titular Hand of Death).  Even though his Kung Fu is superior, he has the additional help of Eight Bodyguards with different styles and two top ranking guards in Smiling Fox and Du Ching (Sammo Hung who also does the stunt coordination) whose overbite is quite preposterous and resembles a ""hopping vampire"" though he is trained in tiger and crane styles.

Yun Fei gets the assistance of a woodcutter Tan, who helped him earlier to get past a roadblock and dispose of a body (a true friend helps you get rid of a corpse). Tan's elder brother was killed by Shih's men.  Tan also obtains the help of ""The Wanderer"" (Yeung Wai) an expert swordsman who accidentally killed a prostitute he was in love with also because of Shih and would have given up his sword for good if it was not for Yun.  These men will help Zhang Yi get across the river to get the plans to help once and for all defeat the Qing Empire and restore the Ming Dynasty (the plot of the Qing Dynasty as bad guys is one of the staples of Hong Kong martial art movies like Heroes Two, Royal Tramp and Iron Monkey).

Many will have bought, borrowed or rented this movie because of the presence of Jackie Chan.  He originally was only supposed to have a stunt man role (helped hired onto the film by his ""big brother"" Sammo Hung) but as John Woo found one of the Korean actors lacking in the physical department, he replaced his part with Jackie Chan and expanded his role according to an interview with Lee Server in ""Asian Pop Cinema"" he stated he ""changed the whole script to focus more on him and show his great skill."" though there might be some fraudulent hindsight with that statement.  Jackie originally had been the stunt coordinator for Woo's first film Young Dragons (1975) that came out a year earlier.  Jackie did get hurt on the film, getting knocked unconscious after being pulled by a cable while being kicked by Dorian Tan and landing and hitting his head on a rock (though this would not be as bad as his most famous accident in Operation Condor where he almost lost his life).

Others might watch this because it belongs in the oeuvre of John Woo.  It is still very early in his career (his fourth film in two years of being a director), but you can see traces of his talent.  There are some nice handheld scenes, a little use of slow motion and hints of ""heroic bloodshed"" elements (though this would come to blossom in Last Hurrah for Chivalry (1979)) like an early scene when Jackie Chan and Dorian Tan first meet which seemed to hint a certain homoerotism (or else those were some of the most strange smiles I have ever seen), but then failed to capitalize on it later in the film.

Overall, this is a decent, yet unspectacular film.  The direction is solid, yet it does not feel like a John Woo directed movie.  The scenery of the Korean hillsides is absolutely beautiful and helps makes this movie easier to watch.  The story is mediocre, but not too many glaring holes in the story. The Kung Fu ability is give or take.  The kicking of Dorian Tan is beautiful to behold, his punching ability and forms are good but not great.  Jackie Chan is also awesome with his fighting and you get to see him use a spear the Little Eagle God Lance as it is called in the film (which that and the staff are the traditional weapons that Jackie is best with).  The highlight fight scenes of the movie are when Jackie fights several of the Eight Bodyguards and later when Dorian fights Sammo.  The latter is especially impressive because of Sammo's willingness to hurt his body to make Tan look good.  James Tien is not much of a martial artist, though his acting if fine as he is the consummate Hong Kong bad guy, so his hand-to-hand combat scenes are a bit pedantic though he has one scene wielding a sword that was good.

The Fox/Fortune Star R1 release is a very good barebones release.  There are no dubtitles and the film is uncut.  There is an English dub, a genuine Mandarin mono track and it is presented in a very nice looking widescreen transfer though there is some damage to the elements.  Unfortunately, like most of the Fox/Fortune Star releases you only get trailers as extras.  Here is another example where the best release is the R2 Hong Kong Legends version -- Ultra-Bit Edition.",1208304000,4,5580,4.463582677165355
1379522,3,B00004YZEL,"I really like this movie co-staring a very young Jackie Chan. This is not a Jackie Chan movie. He has a small role but when he starts to kick but it's worth the wait.

1379523,4,B00004YZEL,"This is a pre 1986 John Woo film.  He wrote it and directed it it is a good movie.  It has a good plot.  It is a realy slow moving film action wise.  The charactors are very well thought out and planned and the story is realy good but it is a kong fu movie with a lot of acton sceens.  It's not meant to be a film just on the basis of plot and story.  The action sceens are a staple of what this film is as a period martial arts film.  Believe me I love movies with that are period films that aren't martal arts films in hong kong but they don't need to be based on the sole idea of reveange. They are sopposed to be a certan way.  I finaly got used to this film and I do like it.  But there is no reason why the action sceens should be this slow paced Samo Hung is tha acton director after all.  I think that John Woo must have wanted the acton sceens this slow paced but for what reason I do not know.  Even the stars of the movie in ""count down in kung fu"" also called head of death by golden harvest in the original english dub.  Tao-liang Tan was the lead and I have seen him do crazy insane stunts but in this movie it was very slow and tame.  See it for youself! To you it may be good it may not!",1131235200,,1203,3.764
1379524,4,B00004YZEL,"1976 R-rated Chinese Kung Fu Film (widescreen). Also known as ""Countdown in Kung Fu,"" ""Shao Lin men,"" ""Shaolin Men,"" and ""Strike of Death."" Contains brief nudity. (Note: the Manchu (or Qing) were the rulers of China when the ""Westerners"" arrived and were the last Imperial rulers.  As they ruled from 1644 until 1911, and had many rebellions to put down, it is unclear when the actions of the movie are supposed to occur).

DVD Features: The DVD contains the movie (in English and Mandarin, and with English subtitles), two trailers for the film (one original, one newly edited), and four other trailers (Spooky Encounters (Sammo Hung, ghost story); Legacy of Rage (Brandon Lee, rated R, modern era, prison movie?); Winners & Sinners (modern era, Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan); Warriors Two (R-rated; older era; Sammo Hung)).

Credits: John Woo (""The Killer"", ""Face/Off"", ""Paycheck""; or as the film credits him: Wu Yu-Sheng) wrote and directed this film.  Sammo Hung (""Martial Law"") provided the Action Direction (and acting, he is one of the Manchu officers (as Lord Du Ching)).  The movie stars Tan Tao Liang (Yunfei; ""Dual Flying Kicks""), James Tien (Commander Shih Xiaofeng; ""Blade of Fury""), Jackie Chan (Tan Xiong; ""Cannonball Run,"" ""Rush Hour""), and Chang Chung (Wanderer the Swordsman or Master Sword; ""Dragon Strike"").  John Woo also appears as Scholar Cheng. (Note: These are the credits as they appear in the movie).

Plot: The Manchu (Qing) rule China, and have tried to take over the Shaolin martial arts.  They failed, and now they have set out to destroy the Shaolin way.  An ex-Shaolin (James Tien) works for the Manchu's to destroy the Shaolin way.  A Shaolin disciple (Tan Tao Liang) fights back with the help of Jackie Chan (delivery man) and Chang Chung (swordsman).  Meanwhile an anti-Qing revolution is underway.

Review: The English subtitles and the spoken English do not match up (though both are providing information not conveyed in the other medium), and the dubbing is distracting (the actual English isn't that bad, but hearing the English and watching the mouth movements is distracting).  In a way, more than one movie is on the DVD.  The spoken English version is not the same as the subtitled English (at one point Hung tells (spoken English) Liang that he likes him, while the subtitled English says something like how Liang is a fool and will die), and you can get a different movie by listening to the spoken English, or reading the subtitled English.  I don't speak Mandarin, nor read it, so I don't know if the three different versions are different (two tracks are for different sound equipment, the third is the original soundtrack). After very brief testing, the Original Mandarin soundtrack  is the track I listened to (seemed best in the limited test).  The movie is shown in widescreen, and the English subtitles show up very well in white in the bottom black bar.

The music, by Joseph Koo, is impressive and provides the right complement to the movie.  The martial arts action is impressive and well done (I'm divided on whether the fighting looks too staged or looks more realistic than the more ""magical, flying"" martial arts action of today).

It's interesting to see Jackie Chan so young (you can also see the young Jackie Chan in the 1981 US movie ""Cannonball Run""; it should be stressed that neither Sammo Hung nor Jackie Chan are the main stars in this movie).

The fighting is quite impressive, the acting (as much as I can tell) is good, the music is great, the plot is solid (maybe slightly less than I would expect from John Woo, and more than I would expect from an early Kung Fu movie). At times the movie seems to be a Chinese version of the Magnificent Seven, though missing one or two people (not sure if I should count Zhang or not as he is someone they have to protect, instead of a fighter; the movie is very vaguely similar to the Western). Lovely countryside they run around in.  Overall, I would give the movie 4.23 stars.",1118188800,14,3986,4.822320117474303
1379525,5,B00004YZEL,"Great film, but a bit misrepresented.  This is not a Jackie Chan movie.  He is in the film, but by no means is he the star.  Tan Tao Liang is the hero.  Great villains.  James Tien is so convincing with his mini blade.  How does he spin that thing?!?!!  This is also a rare opportunity to see Sammo Hung as an evil counterpart to Tien in the film.  Tan Tao Liang kicks are amazing.  This is a a great tale of heroism and patriotism.  Sounds strange, but the English voice overs match perfectly with how the characters act.  That can be a problem with many martial arts films.  Make sure you get the Leg Fighters too!",1043971200,8,616,4.2155172413793105
1379526,4,B00004YZEL,"The action in this film was very continuous but when there was no action sequences it got kinda of boring.  YOu can really see John Woo's style beginning to build up.  He clearly is starting his signature characters where they start to bond with brotherhood sacrifice and friendship.

1379527,4,B00004YZEL,"Hand of Death (aka Countdown to Kung Fu)'s main weakness is that its main character is almost devoid of personality.  By contrast, the supporting players are mostly highly watchable, creating an imbalance.  Nevertheless, on the strength of tremendous fight choreography and a fairly tight plot, Hand of Death is a must-watch for martial-arts fans.
No surprise about the fight sequences, since the choreographer is Sammo Hung, who's been called ""the Orson Welles of action"".  The various styles of fighting are incorporated seamlessly into the film, and ever-shifting locales keep the fights interesting.  Veteran martial-arts actor James Tien steals the entire show as villain Shi Shao-feng, projecting charisma and complexity aplenty, playing a truly formidable opponent.  Unfortunately, Tan Dao-liang as the lead character is weak, the character underdeveloped and passive, and Woo himself (under his Chinese name Wu Yu Sheng) doesn't fare well even in a small role as Zhang Yi, the resistance leader who is rescued by the good guys.  Good thing, then, that Woo had enlisted Jackie Chan (strangely billed as Chen Yuen-long in the film), who walks off as the strongest protagonist character in the whole film with his athleticism, dogged earnesty, and genuinely charming sense of humour.  Hung also has a role as an evil henchman, and his fight scenes are amazing as ever, his unorthodox fighting style always interesting to watch.
Hand of Death is an important and entertaining Woo movie, where he already shows a panache for directing better action scenes than anybody else.  Aside from his very '70s, infuriating overuse of the zoom lens, his work on Hand of Death is highly impressive, making this film a good solid entry in his back log.",1023235200,6,1743,5.2
1379528,5,B00004YZEL,"This is the personification of a Kung Fu film, not your average KF film where the main character has to take revenge for some wrongdoing by the villain, and goes to a shaolin temple or meets some drunken nomad and learns some new Kung Fu technique, and takes his revenge eventually as expected. Nope, alot of twists and turns in this John Woo flick, (which is pretty much his style)Betrayal, sadness, revenge, this film has it all!! Sort of like a Kung Fu fanatics soap opera. The martial arts talent was displayed very nicely by Flash Legs Tan and Jackie Chan, although Jackie wasn't the star of the film and is almost missing throughout half of the movie, his talents were not  wasted.

The story  is about a renegade shaolin disciple who turns on his former Shaolin  brothers and disbands them into secret factions who long for revenge.  Jackie plays the brother of one of the Shaolin men who is killed by the  renegade who joins Tan and a swordsman to take his revenge. Jackie has two  fight scenes with a spear that are very good and along with good fight  scenes from the others. Sammo Hung is in this one also playing a villain,  and also choreographed the fight scene. The story isn't half that bad  either, although it does move kind of slow in some parts.

The attraction of Hand Of Death for me is that the monster makeup  seems to be an early version of the Fantastic Four's the Thing; thus sparking endless debates among comic fans whether or not Jack Kirby's rocky creation influenced this enjoyable sci-fi gem.  The picture quality of the DVD is very sharp and clear, but the muffled audio could use improvement; at times it sounds like it is being broadcasted from a cheap walkie-talkie.

1379543,5,B00004YZEL,"BOTTOM LINE: This motion picture has long been considered something of a ""lost"" film. I have wanted for literally decades to get an opportunity to see this movie, in ANY condition. As an avid fan and collector of B-film science fiction & monster movies, finally obtaining a watchable copy of THE HAND OF DEATH was like finding the Holy Grail! Well... sort of. Now having said that, let me tell you up front that the movie itself is just your typically silly sci-fi nonsense programmer picture, in the grand tradition of such fare. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun! I mean heck, we've got joltin' John Agar as our hero! How can you go wrong? Although in THoD, John becomes his own worst enemy. In most movies of this type Agar is battling the title monstrosities. Here, as in The Brain From Planet Arous, John actually BECOMES the monster. HoD is an entertainingly silly sci-fi quickie, barely clocking in at an hour. Highly, highly recommended for fans of obscure, old school sci-fi. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): The opening scene of this film is very mysterious and grabs you right away. That's a good thing, because the first third of THE HAND OF DEATH's criminally-brief 60 minute run time is wasted on gag-inducing girlfriend histrionics. Ugh! Anyhow, once the mushy love life junk is out of the way we get to the real meat of the movie. Agar is working on nerve gas experiments for the military, so right up front his character loses some major ""sci-fi hero"" points. He isn't some rogue doctor trying to invent a great whatzit for the benefit of all mankind or some other such noble cause. Nope, he's just a clock-punching lab monkey working for those war-mongers in Washington! But hang on folks... that's really just a side note in this film. In the well-established cinematic tradition of over-eager scientists, Agar, in a rush to obtain viable results before his research is shut down, disregards safety protocols and is accidentally exposed to fumes from one of his own experiments while working into the wee hours. He quickly succumbs to the vapors and passes out on a cot in the lab. In a way-cool dream sequence that follows John experiences hallucinations of floating test tubes, beakers & dancing mice(!), which literally fill the screen. You can't get much cooler than that, kids! Upon awakening the following morning Agar realizes that his skin has absorbed the lethal properties of his latest chemical weapons test gone awry. His very touch can now instantly kill - as his unlucky lab assistant fatally discovers. John panics (and I mean REALLY panics) and heads for his boss's home to seek help in reversing the process. While hiding out there his skin continues to darken and bloat up, eventually giving his complexion the appearance of dry, cracked earth. During an argument with his boss, Agar grabs the old man, unintentionally killing him. He flees the house and the final reel has John racing up the California coast in a stolen taxi in search of his girlfriend, (or best friend, or something. The script is easily the weakest element of this movie). He inadvertently kills more people along the way and in the film's final moments he ends up like most every other lumbering monster in the history of sci-fi cinema.

THOUGHTS: The monster make-up is unique and interesting and certainly MUST have influenced legendary Marvel Comics artist Jack Kirby when he drew the original Ben Grimm/The Thing designs for The Fantastic Four. (THE HAND OF DEATH was released only a few months before the first issue of THE FANTASTIC FOUR hit the news stands.) The similarity is TOO strong to be mere coincidence, right down to the hat & trench coat disguise! The black & white cinematography for THoD is surprisingly well-done for such a short feature. The soundtrack is a little unusual; a sort of jazzy score that helps keep the proceedings off-kilter throughout.

THE DVD: The really good news is that this DVD-r from FOX is nothing short of a miracle! After being considered ""lost"" for decades, is it a joy to see this rarity finally arrive on home video looking so utterly magnificent, and in it's proper 2.35:1 'scope format, too! The film's focus is impressively sharp & crisp and thankfully there's very little artifacting, pixelation or edge enhancement. I honestly never thought I'd ever get to see this movie, let alone see it looking so terrific! The bad news is that it's a little pricey. That's because THoD is a manufactured on demand (MOD) release thru Twentieth Century Fox's ""Cinema Archives"" branch. (As such, you MAY experience playback issues if your DVD player is an older unit or is in need of a firmware update. Newer DVD and Blu-ray players should have no such troubles, but YMMV so buyer beware.) In all honesty it's a pretty safe bet that no else is likely to offer up this ultra-rare/obscure sci-fi quickie any time soon. So, if you simply must have this title in your collection, (as I did), then you'll just have to dig a little deeper and pony up the dough. As for me, I'm pleased as punch to finally have John Agar's THE HAND OF DEATH in my treasured B-film library.

-interaction with the white cabbie
-the ""mixing"" of volatile-chemicals
-the ""propensity"" toward violence, coming along with turning black.
-The bongo-driven exotica-music score, in a movie that has nothing to do with the jungle

Even the old doctor and his polio is a metaphor for the perceived ill-effect on society from emancipation of human-chattle.
If you go into this film with your eyes open, (or with a black friend, if you are white) it all becomes very obvious, and for it more interesting.",1517961600,,865,5.006944444444445

7927863,2,B00004YZEL,"This is a review of The Hand of Death, a kung-fu movie (not sure why some of the other reviews are about a sci-fi movie).  Jackie Chan is not the main character, he is a secondary character and this movie is from a period when Jackie Chan is so young that it was difficult to recognize him as he looked so different than he is today.  The kung-fu choreography is okay.  The villain is a general who kills everyone who goes against him, particularly masters of the Shaolin Temple, as they are considered a threat and is believed to be working with rebels to overthrow the emperor and his generals.  Jackie Chan helps out a monk assassin sent by a Shaolin Master who seeks revenge for the death of his Master.  Similar to many kung-fu movies, this film is too simple about the good fighting the bad villains out of revenge. Nothing more.",1492905600,,835,4.431372549019608
7927864,1,B00004YZEL,"Boring 1976 chop sockie (!) with Jackie Chan only having a walk-on. He wasn't yet famous enough for it to be a ""cameo"". Granted I stopped half way through, so he might be back later. It is NOT a ""J.C. movie"", however. Also, something must be wrong with... I don't know. This is the page for a martial arts movie ""Hand of Death"" NOT a S-F movie with John Agar.",1491696000,,359,4.142857142857143

Lots of familiar faces though. Enjoyed the shots in Malibu. The house where the girlfriend was hiding is favorite
filming spot for other monster flicks. The She Creature comes to mind. I used to park my 57 Ford Wagon on the
highway next to that very house from 63-66 to surf the easy waves there. I was 16-19 years then no more surf
