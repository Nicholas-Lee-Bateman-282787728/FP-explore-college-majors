551634,4,6303073786,"Being one of Hitchcock's third sound film, it is amazing how quickly he could master using it.  The use of the music, provided by an actual orchestra behind the wall, when Herbert Marshall is going through the case  in his mind.  The barrage of the the questions of the jury to Marshall.  Also, this play is a rarity in his films: a rather straightforward  whodunnit.  The supporting cast is rather humorous and provides some light  moments.  Marshall provides a good performance and the mystery is a good  one.  Hitchcock is spreading out his wings with this one and shows signals  that is destined for even better works.  However, Murder! is a worthy  effort and is very entertaining.  Take a look at it.",947721600,3,706,4.680327868852459

551784,5,6303073786,"Suspense, a touch of madcap comedy, a brutal killing, a fetching lady in distress, a suave everyman to the rescue, coupled with a climatic scene where the killer meets his end, and you have first-rate Hitchcock.  The 1930 film has been digitally remastered and despite a few glitchesand I do mean a fewthe movie looks remarkably well for its age.  The fetching lady (played by Nora Baring) is an actress who is caught standing over the corpse of a fellow actress.  Worse, she has amnesia and remembers nothing about the murder, or herself.  She is convicted of murder and sentenced to die.  Puzzled by the case, and feeling guilty because he once rejected her for his repertory theater ensemble, one of the jurorsSir John (Herbert Marshall)turns amateur sleuth, engaging two former trouper members to help him find the real killer.

The film is a bit slow-paced and dialogue driven, andlacking English subtitlesrequires close attention to follow the story.  That said, it has several of Hitchcocks touches, including a play within a play, and a cross-dressing villain (Esme Percy) who performs both as a clown and as a trapeze artist.  In one of the most memorable and moving scenes, Percys piquant acting skill manages to elicit our sympathy. The climatic scene takes place under the big tent with the villain performing on the trapeze.  If you're into Hitchcock, as I am, this is a must have.  Five stars.",1459209600,8,1407,4.89873417721519

551846,3,6303073786,"This is one of my least favorite Hitchcock films. It begins with a murder in a neighborhood where everyone works for the same theater group. The supposed murderess is a wimpy wet rag of a girl who delivers her lines like she is a zombie. The murder trail jury deliberation is the bright part of the film with its humor and exploration of human prejudices and lack of judgment. On the jury is a fellow, Sir John, who is a prominent actor who has denied the accused murderess of a job and thus feels guilty that in some way his denial of employment to this wilted flower girl has lead to the murder. Sir John takes it upon himself to prove the young lady innocent once she has been sentenced to death. In a wise move, he hires the theater manager and his gossipy supporting actress wife to assist him in the investigation, turning the twp opinion leaders into his allies. Is the murder solved? Well, yes and no. At 92 minutes, the film drags on in directions that are tangential to the main story.

551852,3,6303073786,"Film = barely 3 stars;  restoration = less than 1 star.  A not-so-bad early Hitchcock sound feature.  Since the dots are connected before they are defined, the film lacks much in the way of suspense except for the plot: the reason for the murder is left up to the viewer to make a best guess.  Sound is exceeding primitive, the music often drowns out the dialog, and the English accents (except for the male lead actor) are thick and turgid.  Subtitles are really needed!  Camera framing is good and camera movement often fluid (the latter is usually missing in early sound films except for some made in France).  Fake exteriors look like, well, fake exteriors.  More disciplined editing would have minimized/eliminated several boring patches.

551935,4,6303073786,"Alfred Hitchcock was well known for making movies about ""wrong men,"" or men wrongly accused of a crime. Sometimes he even made ""wrong women"" movies.

One early example was the obviously-titled ""Murder!,"" one of the earliest movies he made with sound. Hitchcock's signature style was still pretty rough here (particularly in the courtroom scene), but he shows considerable skill at spinning up suspenseful whodunnits with amateur detectives, with some intriguing camerawork.

Young actress Diana Baring (Norah Baring) is found near the body of another murdered starlet, and is assumed by the police to have murdered her ""rival."" She has no memory of what happened; at her trial, most of the jury decides that she's either guilty or dangerously insane. The only one who thinks she's innocent is Sir John Menier (Herbert Marshall), but he's pressured into voting ""guilty"" along with everyone else.

Naturally, he feels guilty about this. So he begins investigating the murder along with stage manager Ted Markham (Edward Chapman) and his wife Doucie (Phyllis Konstam), and quickly discovers that the police's assumption of Diana's guilt meant that they didn't check several important clues. With only hours to go before they hang Diana, Sir John and his allies must find the REAL murderer.

""Murder!"" is an early film of Hitchcock's -- he didn't make early classics like ""The 39 Steps"" or ""The Lady Vanishes"" until years later -- and it was only the third movie he made with sound. So it's pretty rough around the edges. Hitchcock clearly was still learning how to integrate video with sound, and he made some noob mistakes with sound fades and too-abrupt transitions. The courtroom scene may cause whiplash.

But he also showed a lot of raw talent -- the camera drifts and slowly zooms where Hitchcock wills, and there are flickers of the style that would later become legendary. Not many movies from 1930 have such artistry.

And Hitchcock had his trademark mix of mystery and grim humor here -- for instance, there's a thick cloud of suspense over the entire story, which is slightly undermined by the fact that we don't know much about the ""wrong woman."" But it has some  beautifully memorable scenes, such as Sir John staring in the mirror while ""Tristan and Isolde"" blasts from the radio. But he also knew when to leaven the grimness with humor (a bunch of unruly children invade Sir John's bedroom).

One thing does date the movie badly, though. That would be the racial aspect of the plot -- it's not handled in a racist way, but the ""deep dark secret"" and the terminology feel bizarre to a modern viewer.

Marshall (in his first sound role) gives a lovely performance as a clever, posh playwright who is trying to establish some reasonable doubt -- he feels like a genuinely nice guy who wants to right some wrongs, especially if he contributed in any way. Baring does a decent job, but we only really get to know her character over an hour into the movie -- and honestly she plays Diana as a bit creepy in her first scenes.

""Murder!"" has the flaws of a young, developing filmmaker, but it also has the raw talent of a half-flowered genius. Definitely worth a look for people who love a well-written mystery.",1367712000,,3215,4.850364963503649

The questions bother a juror in the case, a wealthy man who eventually is able to prove the young woman...  For an early sound film, the ability to film all that Hitchcock did when sound microphones made actors static and the camera barely able to move.  Hitchcock does quite a bit with the film and shows as many locales as he can to liven up what is essentially a filmed play.  The story is a bit dampened by lack of suspense and intrigue that would make many of his later films classics.  This is a learning curve film and it shows.  The story is too long and needed to be cut and the infatuation with sound at the time made conversations go on a bit too long.

551939,5,6303073786,"Were one teaching a class in the history of the film or in film-making, this 1930 effort by Hitchcock should certainly be on the list of works well worth a few hours of detailed watching and analysis. Almost every minute reflects one or another device that later were used with greater subtlety and cunning in his recognized classics. Of course, this is hardly a masterwork; it still reflects its time, learning how to transform techniques honed in the silent era to the new technology of sound film. Not only is the director confronting this dilemma, so to is the top star-to-be Herbert Marshall, and some of the lesser lights who made successful transitions. Yet, despite the difficulties confronting all involved, it is still Hitchcock, it is still an entertainment of some charm and interest. It is a film that film buffs should, if not must, see and enjoy, first as a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes, and, second, as a lesson in how a morbid subject, murder, can be a vehicle for suspense, interesting characterizations (despite being stereotyped), and drollery.
I can heartily recommend the film to all those who miss the days when AMC, Turner Classics, and the like, were filled day and night, with the studio output of the late 20's and 30's (when some of us were young).

I replaced my VHS with a LaserLight DVD edition -- unwittingly sacrificing the uncut original 104 min. version for the truncated 92:52 min. US edition.

After learning this, I came to this page and, based on the graphic, assumed I could get a DVD that would be the same as my lost VHS copy. However, the Amazon Marketplace company I bought from (no longer listed here) sent me a DVD by a completely different publisher, Westlake Entertainment Group -- and it was just the incomplete US version again. I asked another company listed at the time which edition they were selling, but they never wrote back.

I let time pass and then took my chances by buying an inexpensive used copy from a 3rd Marketplace company, secondspin_us (apparently out of stock as of this writing). They sent me a DVD published by Leisure Entertainment. Luckily, it was the uncut 104 min. version, despite Leisure's case claiming 90 min.

Thus, if you order from this page, it's a tossup what you receive, unless the company answers your enquiry beforehand. This ancient, multiversion, unpopular movie has been released under so many labels, and with unreliable printed statistics to go by, so a tossup may be all you can do.

I had a hard time believing this was a Hitchcock film.  It was only his second attempt at using sound (this was the 1930s).  His first was ""Blackmail.""

A young actress is accused of a murder.  A titled actor, Sir John Menier (Herbert Marshall), who has met the young lady earlier, is on the jury.  The rest of the jurors are convinced that she is guilty, but he is reluctant to accept it; however, due to the overwhelming evidence and the pressure from the other jurors, he goes along and she is due to die.

But, Menier is not willing to concede her guilt and does some investigating of his own.

This is a good mystery thriller, made in England in the best tradition of the films to come in that genre.  It is as captivating as all of the rest of the Hitchcock films, and even includes his trademark cameo appearance, although the term ""cameo"" had yet to be coined for a bit part, by Mike Todd when he made Around the World in 80 Days.

552007,3,6303073786,"This 1930 British sound film is an early effort by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, to continue to experiment with the use of sound in film.  One year before, Hitchcock made the first British sound film, BLACKMAIL,  which is famous for the scene where we hear the subjective thoughts of a character via creative sound editing.  While BLACKMAIL is still largely a silent film, MURDER! is a more complete attempt to make artistic use of sound to advance storytelling and character depiction.  In the opening moments of the film, we see people react to the sound of a commotion nearby, but we never actually see what is causing the noise.  In fact, no act of murder is shown in the entire film.  Many scenes are conveyed via creative uses of sound.  In one ingenious moment, Hitchcock shows the inner thoughts of a distraught stage actress, who imagines the sound of applauses that she would have heard on stage.  In a humorous moment, a man speaks in a high-pitch voice off screen in order to prove to others (including the viewers) that he can convincingly imitate a woman.  There is also the moment which Hitchcock once said was the best in the film: a man's thoughts are revealed to us while he is looking at the mirror and his gramophone is playing in the background.  As his thoughts become more emotional, so does the music from the gramophone.  All these usages of sound are commonplace today, of course.  But during the early sound era, a film like MURDER! was a rather novel and rewarding experience for the audiences.
The story in MURDER! now seems standard: a stage actress is seemingly wrongly accused of murder, and a veteran actor (Herbert Marshall in his first sound film) tries to prove her innocence.  Often described as a whodunit, the film actually reveals the murder's identity about 10 minutes before the end.  The film's last act borrows from Shakespeare's Hamlet, with Marshall trying to stage a play that re-creates the murder in order to catch the murderer off guard.
MURDER! is available in several DVD versions, all of which have mere VHS video quality.  The version made by Madacy has the least sharp picture.  It also has severe cropping at the top of the screen, so that Herbert Marshall's name during the opening credits is completely cut off.  The audio is relatively hiss-free, but probably due to an overuse of noise reduction, which renders the soundtrack muffled and hard to listen to.  And there is no English subtitles nor closed captioning.
The Madacy DVD version, however, is the only video version available in North America that I know of that has the uncut, original 104-minute British version of the film.  The film was cut down to 92 minutes for release in the US, and so video versions of the film have existed only in the 92-minute form.  Madacy has apparently somehow obtained the uncut British print.  Even though the DVD case shows the running time of 92 minutes, it runs 104 minutes.  The DVDs made by other companies, such as Delta (Laserlight) and Whirlwind, all run 92 minutes.  Laserlight's version has marginally better picture than Madacy's, and has a hissier, but less muffled soundtrack.  The Laserlight DVD also has Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese subtitles, but no English.
So what does the extra footage in the 102-minute version consist of?  Not much.  I noticed only one extra scene, which happens to be the great character actress Una O'Connor's only appearance in the film.  In the 92-min version, the scene where Marshall discovers a broken basin is followed immediately by his trip to the prison.  But in he 102-min version, it is followed by an extra scene in the rooming house where Marshall has just spent the night.  The scene is mainly about a light-hearted conversation between Marshall and the rooming house landlady (O'Connor), who indirectly offers clues to the murderer's identity.  The scene also introduces the existence of the cigarette case that later helps pinpoint the murderer.
Since these DVDs are selling at such lower prices, it probably wouldn't hurt if you buy all of the DVD versions.  Buy the Madacy version for the extra footage, and buy the other versions for more presentable picture quality.",1083628800,25,4193,4.855133614627285
552008,4,6303073786,"Parts of this film have more in common with the works of Resnais than with any of the overwhelming bulk of Hitchcock's other films. At times achieving a bizarrely effected comic realism: stylistically, Murder is his most severely surrealistic work.
It is very weird, peculiarly paced, and at stages either 35 or 70 years ahead of its time. Here Hitchcock is wildly experimental. Amidst heated tete-a-tetes, the camera may rest on the listening face of a silent participant for some minutes on-end. The hosery scene in the first few minutes, the transvestitism, and the sick-in-bed sequence are all grotesquely hyper-realistic.
The backstage scene is incredible, and again very strange. There is a refreshing honesty about Murder. For all its slowness, Hitchcock seems precise in what he includes and excludes here.
Essential viewing for any fan of Hitchcock, Surrealism, film history, or art history more generally - and for that matter of Resnais, Welles, Truffaut, Jarman, Roeg, Hamlet, Friedkin, Bergman, von Trier, or Peter Jennings (e.g.). This movie will freak you out.",1061596800,5,1075,5.292397660818714
552009,3,6303073786,"Unfortunately, unlike Laserlite's okay transfer of ""Blackmail"" and unexpectedly superb transfer of ""Rich and Strange,"" this Hitchcock film gets the bottom-of-the-barrel treatment. The transfer is pretty hideous. However, to Laserlite's credit, every transfer of this film that I've ever seen (4 in all) has been pretty intolerable with terrible contrast, several missing frames and enough hissing and popping to hurt a construction worker's ears! But this DVD's no better or worse than, say, Madacy's horrific treatment of the film. Criterion desperately need to get hold of this film and restore it.
The movie's great, but I'm not going to dwell on the plot or the production, as it's hard to give a proper review of this film when I've never seen it in good condition. If you want to know what it's about, read Leonard Maltin's movie guide or one of the reviews below.
4 stars to Hitchcock for the great movie, 2 stars to Laserlite for trying and failing.",1043971200,2,957,4.9875
552010,3,6303073786,"This 1930 effort by Hitchcock has moments of interest that are a sign of  things to come. But overall the movie is a bit dry, even for 1930.
There  are long pauses in dialogue, lending a staged feel to the film. Some of the  acting is stiff. The identity of the murderer becomes clear a bit too  early, and the attempt to flush the killer out into the open is a bit  overacted.
However, there are some fantastic moments that herald what was  in store for moviegoers. The interview in the prison, the jurors  deliberating, and the climax with the killer are pure Hitchcock.
Another  innovation was the voice-over segment as Marshall is shaving in a mirror.  Due to the limitations of the equipment, the sound could not be dubbed in.  Hitch had to place an orchestra off-camera, along with a recording of  Marshall played over a speaker in order to achive the effect.
Film fans  should also look for Una O'Conner, the well-known character actress.",968284800,,945,4.626506024096385
552011,3,6303073786,"As Hitchcock's first film to be conceived from the outset as a sound production (his previous film, ""Blackmail"", had most of its scenes reconceived for sound only after news of the success of ""The  Jazz Singer"" over in America), ""Murder!"" is worth the time  of serious Hitchcock aficianados for that reason alone.  It also delivers  some interesting elements just on the merits of its story and direction.  I  liked the jury trying to overcome the one hold-out who didn't want to vote  guilty (in surrealist fashion, they used a sing-song, schoolyard-like ditty  to break down the juror's objections); the whole theatre-based atmosphere  (the accused is a stage actress and the lone juror who initially doesn't  want to convict is a producer of plays); and the creepy denouement during  the trapeze act.  Be warned, however, the film is NOT a masterful  edge-of-your-seat thriller with all kinds of interesting thematic  undertones (though, there are a few!).  I would still say it's mainly of  historical interest, but-- Hitchcock being Hitchcock-- there's nevertheless  some good stuff to appreciate here.  The Laserlight DVD is fine, by the  way.  It offers a solid print and one or two interesting extras.",957139200,2,1209,5.134020618556701

7836456,4,6303073786,"This review is for the 1998 Madacy DVD of Hitchcock's Murder! (1930).

I bought a used copy of this out-of-print edition, because I was looking for the full movie as opposed to the 92-minute truncated version which is commonly found on VHS and DVD.  An Amazon reviewer kindly informed the readers that the Madacy was the only complete edition, and I followed his advice.  I'm pleased to report that he was right:  the Madacy edition contains the entire 104 minutes of running time, including the full front credits and British Censor Board notice.  He was also right in noting that Madacy undersold the edition on this point: the Madacy case says that the version is only 92 minutes long.  So if you see the Madacy edition, don't be put off by the 92-minute figure on the case: it's the complete edition.

I'm also pleased to report that the picture and sound on the Madacy edition are quite good.  Not excellent, but quite good.  There seem to be only a few picture flaws in the film, but they occur mainly in the midst of Hitchcock's camera tricks, so they may be intentional.  The dialogue is always audible (though of course there is the usual adjustment to be made for British accents), and the picture is clear.  As if often the case with DVDs of older films, a tiny bit is lost at the top and bottom -- you can't quite read the first and last names on the screen credits, and sometimes the top of the actors' heads are very slightly chopped off, but mostly this is not a problem.  Overall, the viewing experience is pleasant.

The main sound problem is caused by Hitchcock's own directorial decision to make the soundtrack ""realistic""; when two characters are talking at once (which happens sometimes in real life, and in a few scenes here), you can't always make out the detail of what everyone is saying.  Similarly, when there is realistic background noise, say traffic noise from the road coming in through a window, sometimes you can't hear dialogue clearly.  In such scenes, Hitchcock chose to go for realistic results at the expense of perfectly distinct dialogue.  I found it mildly irritating, but not excessively so.  It occurs only a few times in the picture.

The soundtrack leaves a bit to be desired; sometimes the volume of the background score is too great and overpowers the dialogue.  Whether this was Hitchcock's decision, or a technical problem in early British sound films, or a defect of the print used for the DVD, I don't know, but it was noticeable two or three times.  I would argue that a film like this -- a character-driven murder mystery -- should employ minimal underscoring anyway, so I would fault the director and/or producer (whoever was responsible) for using too much music.

The story is interesting enough.  I did not find figuring out who the murderer was particularly difficult, but the emphasis was more on character sketching than solving the mystery, so that was not a problem.  A highlight of the film is the performance of Herbert Marshall in an early sound role; he's really quite good.  Una O'Connor shines in her brief scene as a high-pitched, garrulous landlady plagued by her large brood of noisy kids.  Miles Mander is reliable in his role as well, though it's a weak, ill-defined role that leaves him unable to show his talents.  The other actors I don't know very well; many are British actors who never crossed the Atlantic to make American films.  Nonetheless, I found them all pretty good.

The acting, dialogue and story are all low-key, so much so that the film seems a bit anemic at points.  At other points it moves along with energy.  I would not rank this as one of the great Hitchcock films, but it has its moments, both story moments and camera moments.  The trapeze scene near the end contains some of the best camera moments.  As a Hitchcock film, this one is outdone by the earlier silent version of The Lodger (a true masterpiece), and would be outdone by many of Hitchcock's other 1930s films.  But I still think it's a good film; even a mediocre Hitchcock film is generally above average in comparison with other films.

The special features are nothing to write home about.  They are all text features, though in one case, the mildly informative text feature on Hitchcock's camera tricks is illustrated by a clip from the film.  There is also some false advertising on the back of the DVD case about the extent of the special features.  (Note: I have the Canadian DVD manufactured in Quebec, and what follows may not be true of any American Madacy edition.)  The case advertises 10 trivia questions when in fact there are only five, and it advertises a complete filmography of Hitchcock, which is absent.  (Only Hitchcock's films from 1925-30 are listed.)

The scene menu is virtually useless -- only 6 stops for a 104-minute film amounts to only one stop every 17 minutes, which is grossly inadequate.

Overall Judgement:  Bad scene menus, weak special features, but a good print of the complete movie.  And you can get used copies of this edition fairly cheaply from various merchants.  Definitely recommended for Hitchcock fans who have never seen the film, or have only an incomplete edition. But before purchasing, verify with the used merchant that it is indeed the 1998 Madacy edition that is for sale.",1501027200,,5288,4.73224043715847
