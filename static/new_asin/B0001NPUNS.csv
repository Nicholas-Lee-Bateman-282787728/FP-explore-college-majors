8015659,3,B0001NPUNS,"Poor quality black-and-white image, audio not great either, but fine performance, especially by Magda Olivero.  Rubrics are in Italian only, but can usually figure out by cognates.  Difficult to figure out the two different menus that popped up.  Have not yet viewed the second disc, with other performances by Olivero; should be interesting and rewarding.  Web listing did not mention this second disc.",1457222400,,403,5.349206349206349

8015661,5,B0001NPUNS,"This is a document of the ""young"" Magda Olivero (then 50) in one of her most successful roles.

It is a movie production, not filmed from the stage. The lip-synch is not good - Magda sings for God, not for the audience!

If you are a fan of Magda Olivero (born 1910 and still alive) this DVD is a must have.",1300838400,2,307,4.016393442622951
8015662,5,B0001NPUNS,"This Tosca is one of the best I have ever seen and heard.

Finally I can again listen to the real italian way of singing opera.

Here is beautiful voice projection,passion,smothness,perfect diction, and fantastic acting too. The tenor Misciano as Cavaradossi sounds and looks better than the best Pavarotti and Domingo,Fioravanti as Scarpia is the best I have ever seen and heard. Magda Olivero as Tosca is stunning. Buy this DVD, and you will understand what real opera is about!",1149292800,24,480,4.9875
