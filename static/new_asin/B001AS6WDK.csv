8279349,4,B001AS6WDK,"Manje is a terrifically fun horror movie. It has plenty of scenes that will either make you jump, groan, laugh and some at the same time.
There is some great acting here especially by Joe Gerety as ""the Creature / Ed "", who is very convincing and scary.  Tyler McGraw delivers a very noteworthy performance as "" Roger "".  If you are fan of campy horror films you will enjoy this one.  Don't miss it.",1392508800,,399,4.293333333333333
8279350,5,B001AS6WDK,I would suggest this film to mostly anyone because it sort of is like one of a kind in terms of a horror film.,1374192000,,110,3.625
8279351,2,B001AS6WDK,"In the Haitian Creole language, ""manje"" means ""to eat"" and ""food"". So naming your slasher flick about 9 friends camping in the woods while a maniac stalks them MANJE kind of gives away the big reveal. It doesn't take a genius to realize there's more at work here than your typical lone killer slicing and dicing horny teens. Surprise surprise, the killer is eating his victims as well.

You'd think that would be enough to make MANJE stand out, however this one extra ingredient is then overpowered by a myriad of other, just as powerful, spices. There's the acting, the script, the special effects, the score . . . . You can have the most original take on a subject you want, but if all the other components of the dish don't marry well, what you've got, in the end, is just another bland dish with a hint of . . . is that cumin? Paprika? No, it must be all-spice.

Before we get to the bad stuff, let's look at the story.

A group of college friends are going to an abandoned bed and breakfast that one of the characters is about to start work renovating. But before the place is a mess of sawdust and sweaty carpenters, all of his friends are invited up for a weekend of booze and consensual sex. After dinner, just as the festivities are about to get under way, normal early-20s drama begins to plague the couples as relationships are ended, old friendships are renewed, and one new relationship looks just about to begin. Things appear to be business as usual, until one by one our plucky cast is picked off by a mysterious person stalking them in the woods.

What's worse, when one girl happens upon her best friend, she sees she's not only been murdered, but the person responsible is ""eating her intestines like a bowl of spaghetti.""

It appears that, before the gang arrived, someone went into the shed and performed a satanic ritual meant for bringing the dead back to life. Of course, if you've been paying attention to the movie, you know immediately it's Krista's dad--who was killed in the opening scene and who's death is the whole reason for the trip; one of Krista's friends planned the trip so she could get out of the house and have some fun for a change--who has been brought back to life. The only mystery is by whom. And even that's not that big of a problem to solve.

So I can almost applaud MANJE for trying something new in terms of the story in a low-budget slasher flick. At least writer Jason Pitts was trying. Unfortunately his dialogue-writing skills are subpar at best, and director Josh Muscatine couldn't manage a cast of actors if he had to. I can see having a hard time with a bad script and trying to make it work, but can we at least try to get the ""brothers"" to share an accent? And if you show a woman sitting on the toilet, having her pants up kind of kills the illusion. And finally if you're going to make a slasher movie, even on a low budget, for God's sake splurge once or twice and maybe show the kill!

Every killshot in this movie takes place off-camera, or just out of frame. Yes, it saves money, but it also diminishes the impact. When the unlikable characters--and there are plenty of them--get theirs, but we're not allowed to see it, we're still left feeling hollow over the whole thing. Who cares that the dillweed got his comeuppance if it takes place out of frame. And when the characters we genuinely like bite it . . . no, I'm just kidding; I didn't like any of these people.

The score for the movie, by Christian Wood, felt out of place, with too many sweet moments and not nearly enough energy. Every time the characters had a heart to heart, which was surprisingly often for a movie like this, here come the strings. How about you ease off on the sappy score and really help this movie by offering some of your day-job expertise (Christian Wood is a digital effects compositor, working on movies like ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: THE SQUEAKQUEL and MARMADUKE)? Maybe then we could have had some gore instead of just cheap blood splatters on the walls and trees. Throw us a bone here.

Or maybe the fault lies with me. I had no expectations of liking this movie when I started it. In fact, I believed without doubt it would be a cheap dumb movie that promised nothing and delivered. And I was right, for the most part. The backstory of why this is all happening wasn't the least bit original, but it worked within the parameters of this story, so I give it credit for that.

In the end, MANJE is nothing more than another movie. While it contains elements that set it apart from the rest of the pack, the production falls so short in almost every other area that it's just hard to take seriously. If' you've got 87 minutes to kill and absolutely nothing else to do, have at it. Otherwise, this is one to skip.",1342483200,,4767,4.425313568985176

8279353,1,B001AS6WDK,"Don't waste your time or money.  This is a typical teen slasher flick with very little slashing, horror or scares.  90% of the film is devoted to cliche teen talk...girls trashing one another and the guys around them.  This is a real loser.  No acting, no thrills, a plot as thin as a blade of grass and horrible camerawork.  Move on.",1290988800,,334,4.409836065573771
