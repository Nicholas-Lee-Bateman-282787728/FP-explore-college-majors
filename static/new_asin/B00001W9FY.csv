1246753,4,B00001W9FY,One of the sexiest movies.  Beautiful scenery on the Yucatan. Jeff Bridges (the finest specimen of a male form)  at his most beautiful and Rachel Ward always a beautiful class act.  The Mayan Ruins scene is the most beautiful love scene ever. Many of my friends didn't like this movie. If you want to feast your eyes on beauty. This is the movie.,1499904000,,346,4.4603174603174605

1246757,5,B00001W9FY,"The genre of ""Noir Film"" will never die. And the eighties and nineties seemed confirm it. (Body heat, The postman always rings twice, No way out, White sands, China Moon). This solvent remake of ""Out of the past"" carve in relief many other sub plots; the existentail boring of this outsider femme fatale, the sordid corruption backstage, the dazzling landscapes of Cozulel and Chichen Itza, the firm directorial command of Taylor Hackford, the solid performances of Jeff Bridges and James Woods.

The triangle affair will carry out unpredictable consequences on the run. A Noir that certainly has not getting old despite thirty three years after being released.

1246798,1,B00001W9FY,"Saw this around the time it first came out and didn't like it then. Lately, I've been hearing the song on the oldies radio station, so I thought I'd give the movie another try. After all, Rachel Ward is so beautiful and I couldn't remember the plot anymore.

If you like movies where all of the characters are either partially or totally morally bankrupt, this is the movie for you. An injured football player is sidelined and he feels it's some kind of plot to kick him off the team. It may well be, because his former lawyer is now working for the evil rich lady who owns the team. Sidelined football player is offered a couple decent ways to earn a living (high school coaching, bartending) but he is too unfocused and/or lazy for a real job and besides, he already spent all his football loot and is deeply in debt. Instead, he decides to take quick cash to go looking for a spoiled rich girl who ran from her corrupt boyfriend after he beat her. BF says she stole 50K from him. First she denies it, then she admits that even though she gets a huge allowance from Mummy she stole his 50K. I won't add any more spoilers ... you get the general drift. All the characters and events follow the same path -- crimes, immoral stuff and more crimes. Somehow the two main characters manage to fall in love, though exactly how this happens is not fully developed.

I actually dislike the movie even more than I did when I was a very young woman. A lot of people were ga-ga about this movie when it first came out. I have no idea why and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Nice theme song though.",1459209600,,1588,4.325503355704698

1246837,3,B00001W9FY,"Good blu-ray video and sound quality in this popular 80s neo-noir remake of a much better film, Robert Michum's 1947 ""Out of the Past."" Bridges and the gorgeous Rachel Ward look marvelous and generate some R-rated heat; the scenery in Cozumel and the Yucatan are great; but the dialogue is wooden and some fine actors [Richard Widmark, James Woods, and Jane Greer, the prototype femme fatale in the '47 original] are wasted as cardboard cutout evil capitalists. Its a shame the writer and director Hackford didn't watch and learn more from Chinatown a decade earlier when he attempted this modern neo-noir. Where was Robert Townes when they needed him? Though the video transfer is pretty, as are Bridges [hard to believe he was The Dude 14+ years later ....] and Ward, this one simply hasn't aged well.",1418860800,,803,4.868613138686132

1246839,4,B00001W9FY,"I may be prejudice here, I was fortunate enough to work on the film as Alex Karras' stunt double. I was captured by the smooth of Jeff Bridges, the beauty of Rachael Ward, the majesty of Taylor Hackford and the essence and alluring beauty of the Yucatan.
The opening chapter to my book, ""Star, Stunts and Stories; One Man's Fall to Fame"" is dedicated to AAO. The fact that I was to perform a stunt that several others had turned down, may have been what sparked my interest in the film, but when I saw it in the theater for the first time, I was immediately wooshed back to the steamy and sweltering days working in the middle of the Mayan Ancient ruins...which is in the middle of the jungle.
I think that Jeff and Rachael were true to their characters and I believed their struggle...just as I believed that James Woods was a spoiled rich kid. I believed it all. The music by Phil Collins is perfect,  the love story is honest and deep. And the action (did you see that car chase?) The movie overall is an exciting story, beautifully shot and hey, watching Jeff and Rachael on screen ain't so bad either. Definitely catch this film!",1416441600,9,1134,4.425837320574162
1246840,5,B00001W9FY,"I absolutely ADORE this film! Sure, it's not perfect, but who says it has to be? The acting is good, for the most part and the locations are great. It ages really well. Here I am watching it decades later and except for a couple of the hairstyles, you can't tell how old it is. I have to watch it every time I catch it on tv. Jeff Bridges has never looked better.

As much praise as I can offer for, Against All Odds, see the original, Out of the Past, with Robert Mitchum, Kirk Douglas, and Jane Greer, they may remake them, but they don't make them better.

1246911,3,B00001W9FY,"This remake of the 1946 noir classic ""Out of the Past"" can't stand up to the original. Though not even half as old, it already looks and feels dated - despite the location shooting you never lose the sense there's a camera crew hovering next to the actors. I like Bridges and Woods, but the original is studio Hollywood at it's shimmering best - dark, mysterious and gritty, with Mitchum and Kirk Douglas in top form, plus the astonishing Jane Greer (also in this version). That said, this does have moments and the DVD commentary is pretty interesting.",1341014400,2,553,4.653061224489796
1246912,4,B00001W9FY,"I read the reviews like everyone else before buying this movie, and I have to disagree with some of them. Although this movie does make you wonder where all of it went wrong in the first place, I had fun watching it. It was an interesting maze, filled with dark secrets. Anyone who likes finding the dirt on other people (in movies, if not in reality) would find this movie very appealing. It's like every character in this movie has some kind of dirt on them (Don't we all?).

With every twist, my mouth dropped and I was like ""Oh no, he/she didn't!"" It's true that you can kind of see where the twist is coming and how it will come up but by the time you can get over it, the plot has continued without you, but eventually one catches up.

To be fairly honest, I only watched this because of James Woods, being a girl fanatic about him. On his part, he had some amazing acting, and this goes right along with his trademark of portraying dark, intense characters. Though he wasn't as intense as I would have expected him to be, he still gave that stunning performace, creating a certain creepiness out of Jake, that makes the audience know he's not playing games with anyone.

My only complaint that keeps this movie from being five stars is that I felt there were too many love scenes between Jeff Bridge's character and his co-actress. Though the two made some great chemistry, I thought there were one too many love scenes.

The scenery is very breath-taking, making shots of the Mayan Ruins where not a lot of movies have been able to take place. I am a bit of a history buff so when the two stars talk about how Mayans used to place bets on football, you get a little taste of a Roman game, in some ways. It's stunning and breath-taking, almost makes me want to go there and see it for myself.

This movie was very good, despite some bad reviews. I'd say if there's a fan out there that likes Jeff Bridges or James Woods, they must watch this movie. Even if they don't watch it again, at least you can have it under the belt as one of the movies they've watched.

I'm keeping this movie :)",1336348800,,2095,4.318066157760814
1246929,5,B00001W9FY,"If it is possible to rate art the way CONSUMER REPORTS magazine rates appliances, I award the 1984 film AGAINST ALL ODDS four stars but add a fifth for this D.V.D. because of two of its features, commentaries by 1)the director and two actors and 2) the director and writer.

The drama-thriller AGAINST ALL ODDS tells the story of people struggling to keep what they don't realize or we don't realize was never theirs, with the ruins of Cozumel, Mexico, a foreshadowing setting.  James Woods' performance as the intense bookie Jake Wise knocked me out when I saw AGAINST ALL ODDS at the movies in 1984.  While the original poster pictures lead actors Rachel Ward and Jeff Bridges, I notice the D.V.D. image here includes Woods, whose career continued to blossom probably in part due to his work in this picture.

All these years later, a couple of weak plot devices in AGAINST ALL ODDS work against what is otherwise still a challenging story for grown-ups.  Most distracting is a fight between lead character Terry Brogan, a football player played by Bridges, and one of his coaches, an ex-player played by Alex Karras, where Brogan emerges as if nothing happened despite, among other blows, having the Karras character kick him in the stomach.  Also, the character of Edie, played by Swoosie Kurtz, proves instrumental to resolving the story but she is left out of the film's wrap-up.

I guess because of the hit 1983 television drama THE THORN BIRDS, Rachel Ward has top billing in AGAINST ALL ODDS. At the time one might have thought Ward was on her way to stardom, as she also had the films SHARKY'S MACHINE and DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID under her belt but I never saw her in another movie or television production after AGAINST ALL ODDS.

Interesting and, thanks to James Woods, often funny, the two AGAINST ALL ODDS commentaries add value to this D.V.D. package.  Hearing director Taylor Hackford and others talk about what went into AGAINST ALL ODDS refreshes one's appreciation for the art of filmmaking.",1321315200,,2012,4.791907514450867

1246934,3,B00001W9FY,"The fact that the show includes Rachel Ward should tell you to take a look.  Regardless of her haircut, she was great; I prefer her with longer hair.

Some of the plot/storyline is a little disjointed and hard to follow.  The premise is easy enough: bummed out hero needing work and shifty buddy to provide it.  Of course, hero latches onto female who happens to have history with buddy.  Obvious complications ensue and the fun, as well as some confusion begins.  Jeff and Jim do well, and again, there's Rachel.  There are nice cars and a very much-underrated car race - that was nicely done.

The scenery (not just Rachel) is great and indicative of the 80's mood.

Russell finds her and they fall in love, but Ward has some quirky personality traits and ends up back in the states with Woods.  I kind of lost interest when the plot shifted to the states.

1246962,5,B00001W9FY,"Expert opinion says that since the advent of color film, a good contemporary noir film is an L.A. noir film; that seems to be largely so, except then you've got ""Body Heat,"" set in Florida.  Be that as it may, ""Against All Odds"" is an LA noir film: it profits from the unique atmosphere of Los Angeles, the sinister corruption behind the sunny smile; the reality of arid desert behind the wastefully-watered green lawn.  And most particularly, the parched, penned-up ill-respected Los Angeles River that features in Roman Polansky's mythic ""Chinatown, and ""in ""The Narrows,"" one of Michael Connelly's recent books. The river also, of course, features in that well-known teenage film noir,""Grease,"" in which John Travolta and his all-singing, all-dancing fool friends stage their drag race in the river's concreted bed, graced by only the merest trickle of water. The Los Angeles River: Ignored until it rampages.

""Against All Odds"" is a loose 1980's remake of Robert Mitchum's film noir, ""Out of the Past.""  Jane Greer. femme fatale of the earlier film, plays mother to Rachel Ward, this film's femme fatale.  Richard Widmark, important player in many earlier films noir, is on hand here too, in a small but critically important part.  The plot is set in motion when Jake Wise,(James Woods), well-connected nightclub owner and man of many parts, sets his old friend, used-up former pro football player Terry Brogan (Jeff Bridges), to find and return his runaway girlfriend Jessie Wyler (Rachel Ward), hiding somewhere in Mexico.

For starters, Mexico, Bridges and Ward have never looked hotter, the Ward-Bridges sex scenes are too darn hot, and the seemingly mandatory confusing LA real estate corruption subplot doesn't stop the main story line cold too often. The film was ably directed by Taylor Hackford, and the three principals carry their roles. There's also a flavorful supporting cast: Swoosie Kurtz, Saul Rubinek, Alex Karras, Dorian Harewood. ""Against All Odds"" is a bit dated, stuck in the '80's, and it's not the greatest noir story ever told, but it offers a lot of visual heat.  It also delivers on the emotional heat meter, at least to me: true to noir conventions, nobody gets what they want, surely not Terry Brogan, who realizes, belatedly, that Jessie Wyler is literally too hot for him to handle,and he's going to have to leave her to her rich, powerful mother.  Yes, it's been done before, possibly better, but ""Against All Odds"" stands and delivers on its own, and is worth a look-see.",1162857600,60,2509,5.012019230769231
1246963,2,B00001W9FY,"I can't get over all the glowing reviews of this deeply flawed film I've read here! First off, let me say that Jeff Bridges is one of my absolute all-time favorite actors (""Big Liebowski"" and ""Fearless"" by themselves would make up for a dozen ""Against All Odds"") but this movie is a serious train wreck! What a waste of good actors and beautiful locations. It is truly poignant to see the highlights of the Yucatan area circa 1983 before that wondrous part of the world became package tour Gringolandia and that alone is almost worth the two hours and two bucks but Good God does this movie nosedive into atrocious absurdity over the last hour or so! I think a couple of more rewrites might have done a world of good as none of the actors involved are bad (George Poppadopalous arguably notwithstanding), the locations are second to none, and the basic storyline had at least a marginal amount of promise. Whatever the case, I suppose that's neither here nor there because this movie turns into a semi-glossy Matlock crapfest once Jeff and Rachel finish steaming up the Mayan stonework. Que pena. The amazing footage of the pyramids and statues of Chichen Itza and the gorgeous turquoise waters of Cozumel and Tulum are definintely worth checking out though if you think you can stomach the ham handed TV movie way in which the last half of this film unfolds.",1152748800,8,1359,4.690376569037657
1246964,4,B00001W9FY,"What do you get when you combine Jeff Bridges, Rachel Ward, James Woods, Richard Widmark, and Jane Greer?  The VERY best of the old and the new.  This movie was a classy remake of ""Out of the Past"" which was made sometime in the 1950's.

Rachel Ward plays a spoiled rich girl bent on rebellion much to the consternation of her mother played by Jane Greer.  ""Jessie"" (Rachel Ward) runs away from home and aging football star, Terry Brogan, (Jeff Bridges) is hired to find her by her boyfriend Jake Wise. (James Woods)  From there this plot takes off with more twists and turns than I have ever seen in a movie.  The triad of Jake, Terry, and Jessie becomes more entangled and complicated in a maze of deadly secrets and lies.

What I loved about this film was the way the director used the plots and subplots to weave together a fantastic and suspenseful drama.  Richard Widmark is superb as the corrupt Ben Caxton.  The soundtrack is exceptional and the scenery is great. All in all this is a quality film that I loved when it came out in the mid 80's, and still love today.",1129766400,7,1074,4.411167512690355

The acting is pretty good - Jeff Bridges was pretty sexy at this point (and I'm a straight GUY!), Woods is always good, and Rachel Ward always seems to play the same character so I can't fault anything here.  The movie gets bogged down in the politics played between Terry, his agent, and a subplot involving some land-development.  A streamlined script would have made this much better.  Direction is good, though, especially in the car race.
If you're looking for steamy remakes of old movies try Body Heat instead.  William Hurt plays virtually the same character as Bridges does here and the script is much tighter.

1246991,3,B00001W9FY,"Before 'eighties became a cliche, it was considered modern and chick. This is a serious film from that era. It takes its time for the story to develop and for the dialogue to sink in. James Woods gives an excellent performance as a nightclub owner and a gangster. Rachel Ward does an excellent job portraying an adventurous woman in an age before adventurous women in pop culture came to be signified with guns and leather jackets. The film is really two films in one; the first is a romantic triangle between James Woods, Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward. The connection between athletics and organized crime and nightclubs hangs ominously in the background and the characters are subtle, if not sophisticated, showing off the eighties hip in the natural setting, and it culminates in Jeff Bridges discovering the girl.
The second part of the film is poorly done, essentially it's a remake of Chinatown with a giant conspiracy that unites the real estate developers wit organized criminals and the football team in one universal conspiracy. Guns are fired, people wind up dead and everything is tied up neatly in the end. It's too conveniet to be a decent thriller and it avoids the complications of dealing with girl leaving the leading man on her own free will and going back to the creep she used to be with, which come to think of it, is the realistic ending!
They could have made an excellent film by developing the romantic story to its conclusion and treating it relaistically, as they had the first part of the film, leaving the guy holding the empty bag in the end, alone and picking over the remains of his career, instead they opted for a typically Hollywood conclusion of ending up with the Big Bang fireworks of biblical proportion that lets the leading man get away clean and start over again.",1009497600,,1804,4.73015873015873

One of the first videos we rented was thsi one and though I was a little young I watched it to the end, fascinated---the complexity even then floored me and I remember crying at the end.  (My mother fell asleep halfway through.)  Pulled out another videotape while on vacation and watched this movie again and it drew me in, I haven't watched it in years so there was a level of not quite remembering what occurred and why.  What has always caught me in this movie was Rachel Ward as Jessie and how essentially flawed she is, she has enough of a cherubic face and a sensual appeal that it's never quite clear how much of her actions are genuine fear and genuine manipulation.  I had forgotten the scene where she goes to her familyf or help and her descriptiopns of her relationships to them are belied by the way her mother shows genuine concern for her and the way she she cuddles up and into her godfather's arms---the exact same way she does with Jeff Bridges and James Woods (both who inhabit the roles, the dialogue with an ease and menace that is wonderful)!  Her mom, Jane Greer stands behind them with a look on her face that suggests there is another layer of relationship going on between the two that crosses some line, it's a perfect moment to watch for.  Swoosie Kurtz shows up in a pivotal role that got me to take notice of her and remember her and her name even way back then (much like Grace Zibrikie) and there is enough meat to her to show that Terry doesn't notice a good thing right unde rhis nose as she shows him a kindness and eventually an assistance that puts her in constant career and physical jeopardy. The plot is complicated and secondary to the point of the story which is Jessie getting people to love her and then it being a measuring game of who can take better care of her.  At the end when she watches Terry and the crtedits role, as she still stands there, small motions occuring, it is a brilliant way to capture her many mercurial moods and to also heighten the thought of what will occur between these two later one, there is a playfulness to her, a lack of regret, that suggests that even with the risk they'll get back together but after watchign her in action---is that a good idea? The best, absolutely best part of this is the sweat house sex scene--I'm by no means a film voyeur but it rates as literally number one of number two on teh scale of movie erotica---there is a moment when Rachel Ward cries a single tear that to this day blows me away, lookign at acting and even the intimacy, it crosses that invisible line where I sometimes wonder if everyone is unattached in a scene in their personal lives, how real is a sex scene?",994118400,7,2875,4.360747663551402

1246997,5,B00001W9FY,"Director Taylor Hackford doesn't make a lot of mistakes.  But he points out one in the deleted scenes area of this disc.  When I saw it back in 1984, I didn't understand what the heck Jeff Bridges was doing flying  around Mexico to throw James Woods off the train while Rachel Ward went to  the Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza (an awesome but hellishly hot spot I visited in 1995).  The deleted scene helps make this clear and really enhanced my  enjoyment of the film.

Whether you like the movie or not, the chance to  see the seaside ruins of Tulum and the astronomical temple of Chichen Itza  is worth it.  No one apparently had been allowed to film there before.  And  Jane Greer is great as the chilly mother of Ms. Ward and real estate heiress.  In a role that demonstrates the calm and quiet banality of evil, Ms. Greer is also a link back to the film's inspiration - the great ""Out of the Past,"" which she did with Robert Mitchum in 1947.

It's true the film comes apart a little i the end with some obvious twists you'll see coming.  But it doesn't matter.  The whole effort is beautifully shot and assembled with a young Swoosie Kurtz thrown in for some comic relief.

Blu-Ray update:
I was ready to pick up the blu-ray of this title, which came out in Spring 2011. However, it's only a single layer BD disc. The studios should come up with a new rule that if in 2011 and beyond they're going to take a cheap approach to transfers of great films and only place them on 25GB discs instead of the normal 50GB, then they should charge half the price of a normal blu-ray.

When sleazy James Woods slinks into the picture the threesome implodes.",1505347200,,617,4.421052631578948
