809147,4,6304184689,"This entry into the zombie movie hall of shame is worth viewing a few times. The zombies are the italian purple and red kind for the most part. The acting is horrible, the plot is that of Dawn of the Dead, the soundtrak  is stolen from Dawn of the Dead, but it's a worthy try at a  ""good"" zombie flick.  But, weirdest part of the movie: The  journalist lady gets nekkid to go into the tribal village in Papua New  Guinea, then gets makeup on out of nowhere while stock footage is edited in  with no remorse! It's a weird Natl Geographic gone horribly wrong.",924220800,2,557,4.257142857142857
809365,2,6304184689,"Every review in this section seems to be referring to the Bruno Mattei movie Night of the Zombies.  This product, however, is a movie of the same name directed by Joel M. Reed.  It has nothing to do with tropical island zombies, but rather WWII-era Nazi zombies!  NOTZ (get it?) is about a CIA special-agent investigating deserters from the U.S. Army Chemical Corps unit.  Once in Germany, he uncovers a plot of world domination involving...Nazi zombies!  This movie is terrible, but in a good way.  I suspect an updated version could be done much better, but if you like cheese you'll appreciate this one.",1103587200,3,606,4.778846153846154
809366,4,6304184689,"This is one of the cheap knock-offs of DAWN OF THE DEAD, right down to the ripped-off soundtrack. It is poorly made, and sort of slow in parts (especially the terrible National Geographic stock wildlife footage)... but if you're into Zombies or European gore from the 70's/80's... this film is a MUST. When the zombies attack, the movie really kicks. Expect the usual gore as the cast is butchered. Great apocalyptic ending, too. I give this 4 stars from the view point of a zombie fanatic, if you like Zombies, you're at the right stop!!",1094169600,,538,4.673684210526316
809367,1,6304184689,"Note: This review is for the Night Of The Zombies DVD released by Cydonia Pictures.

For those who know the history, Night Of The Zombies is one of the many names for Hell Of The Living Dead.  The transfer for this DVD appears to be the same master tape used by Vestron Home Video in 1985 and Creature Features in 1996.  Both versions has tape creases in the same spots during the opening credits.  And, for those who have seen the 10,000th generation copy version of Vestron's release (I have not personally seen Creature Feature's version on tape.) it is so dark you really cannot see what is going on during a scene!  This transfer is, for sure, Creature Feature's release because the end copyrights state: ""Copyright 1996 Creature Features.""  As stated, get the Hell Of The Living Dead DVD from Anchor Bay.  That one has the exact same cut, with the different titles, plus an untruncated closing credits sequence, BUT most importantly, an original vault film print was used.  It was cleaned up and letterboxed.  FAR superior to this one... which, somehow, is even DARKER!  The color even fades in and out almost as if Macrovision was detected during the transfer!

I got this DVD because I'm a Night Of The Zombies completist.  And, even at that, I can't recommend this DVD over Hell, because for the same price or less, you can get the better DVD.  This DVD does have a few extras not on the Hell DVD, but, they are not worth the price of admission: a TV trailer, which consists of the exact same text used in Dawn Of The Dead advertising, 3 ""newspaper ads,"" even though they're the same ad just edited down and truncated, and a stills gallery which has some pictures not in Hell's gallery, including unused scenes or shots entirely for publicity modeled after existing scenes.  There are also two trailers for The Gates Of Hell, interestingly also released by Creature Features in 1996 with Night Of The Zombies, but, one of them is just a shorter version of the other.

All in all, not even this Night Of The Zombies completist can recommend this DVD transfer.  It's worse than the Vestron VHS; I could make a better one with my VCR and a DVR!  The extras just aren't worth enough to own it and Hell Of The Living Dead.

Lastly, just to address the other question I had had over this DVD.  Yes, this is the Night Of The Zombies directed by Bruno Mattei (As Vincent Dawn.) and not the one starring Jamie Gillis.  So, for anyone else wondering, the front cover art is correct, despite some sites that have listed this exact same DVD as the Jamie Gilis release.  (BTW, interestingly enough, the text on the back cover of this DVD release is exactly the same text used on the Vestron VHS home video release!)",1085702400,3,2711,4.5484536082474225
809368,3,6304184689,"Alright, I hated this movie upon its first viewing. It isn't oscar material here... this is a campy zombie movie directed by Bruno Mattei. Much un-intentional humor, laughably bad acting, random scenes of animal stock footage and a score ripped off from Dawn Of The Dead all can be found in this gignatic cheese fest. If you own more than 10 zombie movies (and are a fan of the campier ones, ie Burial Ground), I suggest getting this. If you can tolerate or are a fan of B and low budget horror movies, I suggest finding a copy of this. It has been released as Hell of The Living Dead on a nicely done DVD. Its a fun little zombie camp fest you cant help but laugh at. Rent it and have a good time.",1082073600,,698,4.177777777777778
809369,2,6304184689,"This movie is definately only for the die-hard zombie fans, because we are the only ones that could find anything redeeming in it.  I mean I have seen a lot of the eurotrash zombie movies, and this one is up there as one of the worst.  Very reminiscent of Zombie (which is a classic), but only because it rips it off.
The acting and dubbing are awful (to be expected and can be overlooked), even the horrible zombie makeup can be appreciated.  But this movie is drawn out, especially with the addition of the stock jungle footage.  I mean there is hardly a story behind this movie:  just a beginning an end and some ... in the middle.  But I won't overanalyze, you're not supposed to with this kind of movie.
There are a few redeeming points to this movie that warrant at least a two star rating.  The Goblin soundtrack (the same band from Suspiria) is pretty good.  There are definately some great gore effects, and a few deaths not to be missed (some even made me squeamish, which is hard to do).  There is a lot of over the top humor, which is really corny (and strange), but definately enjoyable.  And of course, there is some nudity, albeit it seems as if it was an afterthought.  I was a little disappointed with the nudity though, I have come to expect more blatant nudity with this caliber European horror movie.
I found this movie used, and paid very little for it, and therefore find it worth owning...I wouldn't pay too much for this movie though.",1046044800,2,1458,4.443609022556391
809370,2,6304184689,"This movie was bad. As much as I hate to bash any zombie movie, I found myself fast forwarding through it. I have never done that to any movie. Somehow the director took a good story line and (messed) it up.
Whats up with all of the stock jungle footage? The coolest part of the movie is when the girl gets naked.
And that is not all that. Im giving this movie two stars. One for being a zombie flick, and one because I like zombie flicks.",1007683200,,439,4.057471264367816
809371,5,6304184689,i get mad when people talk bad about this movie it was grat so what if it was dubed not good at all you have to chek out this movie especally if your a fan of zombi films and comon the sound trac is from goblin they rock long live zombies,1006646400,,238,3.6862745098039214
809372,2,6304184689,"Ok I am a huge zombie movie fan and this film was filled with ridiculous themes.  Its just the average zombie flick goes on a tropical island find these undead people walking around blah blah blah.  The acting was down right horrid, usually english dubbing is bad but this is horrid.  The theme of survival was down right hilarious it was so stupid, i mean a soldier letting the zombies circle him and teasing them, one guy suppose to look for undead decides to play dress up in this deserted house where the undead aren't far, oh and he puts down his gun so he can dance around with a cain while looking for survivors, give me a break.  I only say this movie was ok because of the gore, though it was overly done itself, the zombies looked pretty dumb themselves, very poor make-up.  All in all its a dumb zombie flick but as a zombie fan go ahead and check it out if u haven't seen it, though i must say towards the end when the woman got her whole face ripped throuh was pretty cool looking, well thats enough said.",1006041600,2,1018,4.253886010362694
809373,1,6304184689,"Being a fan of genre films (I think Fulci is brilliant), I have to say this is probably the worst movie of all time, bar none, no arguments.  Sure, it's a slice of Italian cheese featuring the Italian monster of choice: the zombie.  But even hordes of the living dead and millions of rounds of ammo being emptied out can't raise the pulse (or laugh quotient) on this sputtering junker of a movie.  Vincent Dawn (who's really talentless hack Bruno Mattei) has to have been the most worthless director on the low-budget scene during the 1980's.  NOTZ is inept, poorly written, has no likable characters.  The CREATURE FEATURES print of this film is incredibly awful and looks like a 2nd-generation bootleg at best.  All in all, a movie that will have you hating life long after the end credits have rolled.  You've been warned.",972172800,,825,4.6875
809374,5,6304184689,"This movie aplies only ot die hard zombie fans.  But in are eyes it is a thing of dreams.  The first death is a man who is killed by a zombie rat he falls and unleashes a toxic gas that kills eveyrbody and turns them into  flesh eating nombies.  This films shear poorness is what makes it so good.  The best part, no happy ending.  All ther stars die and the zombies are  left to raise hell.",956448000,3,391,4.0

7864759,4,6304184689,"As a teenager in 1984, Hell of The Zombies (or Night of The Zombies as it was known in the states) was playing at the local theater. My Dad,stepbrother and one of my friends went to see it, I was originally going to go, but alas, I chickened out and stayed home. I guess I was afraid of all the gut munching carnage that Zombie films are known for. Well, when my dad and company came back, they were laughin and ranting over how bad Night of The Zombies was. Years later I saw it in the horror section of Blockbuster. By then I had toughened up a little when it came to gore, so I rented it for a get together with my friends. The reaction? Yes, the story was mind numbingly stupid, yes, the soundtrtack was obviously lifted from Dawn Of The Dead, yes, the dubbing was off track with lame and predictable dialouge. But you know what, we were all laughing watching this ""bad""  zombie flik all the way to the ending. Looking back to 1984, my stepbrother was having fun telling his friends not about how bad it was, but all the great kill scenes! Night Of The Zombies may not be Dawn Of The Dead or Lucio Fulci's Zombie, But despite it's cheesy atmosphere (which could be one of it's strong points) it's a hell of alot of fun to watch, if not for the kill scenes, but also for it's sloppy execution. I think this dvd would a welcome addition to anyones Zombie Horror collection. Happy gut munching!",1331078400,6,1395,4.284090909090909
7864760,4,6304184689,"This is a hoot! The dubbing is terrible and whats with the flying monkees and wildlife. You know its bad when the director uses a different name,hey great way to hide from everyone. Its a total rip off of Dawn of the Dead with SWAT guys and the same Goblin music used in Dawn of the Dead here. Oringinal! Its gory as hell and the cat coming out the old woman was classic. This movie had different titles,Hell of the living dead,Zombie creeping flesh. Sit back and get ready for a laugh fest and watch the woman at the end she's still screaming after having her neck ripped open.",1257206400,2,578,4.3119266055045875
7864761,3,6304184689,This film from spain was just a splatterfest. Sure its actors are terrible and the dubbing is bad....That's the point! Like the previous writers said its so bad its good. I only wished they would of focused more on the city area and not the natives. The birds diving and the other animals hunting their prey was not necessary. I found it distracting! Overall this one stays in a collection for a cheap laugh providing my mood.,1185667200,,426,4.545454545454546
7864762,4,6304184689,i had to take away 1 star for the quality because its hard to see whats happening at night but if that were better i would have givin it 5 this movies really cheesey and gorey so be aware if your looking for something serious,1171497600,,225,4.022222222222222
7864763,3,6304184689,"The big problem I have with this movie isn't the storyline.  I love the storyline, it is a very Faustian, very grim, storyline about the desire to end world overpopulation by...well...as the chemicals show...creating zombies across the 1st and 2nd world countries.  And things work out pretty darn well...no more overpopulation, everyone's a zombie, and everyone has a meal... the living... a great story, and while the actors and special effects aren't anything to write home about, I think the movie does a great job bringing the story from beginning to end.  The big problem I have with the movie is the transfer of the movie onto DVD.  Now, yes this is a fairly old movie, and it seems that the DVD company that's selling it isn't around (at least I couldn't find it on the net).  Still, one would hope for this price we would see the transfer far clearer than when the movie was viewed on vhs.  I really wish the film was cleaned up enough so that I can see what's going on.  Still, if you like zombie movies, this is a great one, I give the movie itself thumbs up...you'll just be straining your eyes to see what's going on!",1153785600,4,1130,4.509803921568627
7864764,2,6304184689,"Stan Runk summed it all up pretty well: 'Hell of the Living Dead' is the kinda zombie movie you see after you've seen all the good ones.  And yeah, this is pretty crappy, and not as amusing on a camp level as a lotta other lousy horror movies.  However, if you're the sorta person who is even considering watching this film, you might as well go ahead.  You'll probably enjoy yourself, more or less, though you'll probably just wanna watch 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'The Beyond' again for the 10th time rather than watch this again.

Zombie movies have never been too good with plot, and this film is no exception.  There's a not too bright seeming journalist lady, who will get naked, a couple a dudes in blue uniforms who are apparently supposed to be SWAT team members, and zombies.  A whole zombie conspiracy, as a matter of fact, leading to what has got to be the lamest attempt at social commentary your gonna see in a zombie movie outside of 'Dr. Butcher M.D.' perhaps. (That movie is awesome.  Check it out if you haven't seen it, though if you're looking at this, you probably already have.)  The film takes place in New Guinea, I believe, which leaves them ample opportunity to splice in a lot of nature doctumentary footage, and some tribal people documentaries as well.  This is totally the least convincing, most obvious combination of multiple films in the modern era.  Pretty funny.  Some of the stuff they show doesn't seem like it would be in New Guinea, but I've never actually been there, so I can't prove 'em wrong.  It can get boring though.  Still, aside from travel footage Mattei likes to throw in a nice shot of bird or something totally at random, like right after a zombie is attacking someone.  Pieced together doesn't begin to describe it.

The zombies are standard Romero style ones, with obviously cheap but passable makeup.  What can I say, zombies are always fun, and these ones aren't bad at all, 'cept they aren't given enough to do.  They do have some of the finest zombie moaning/wheezing I've ever heard, however.  There's some gore, but it's nothing to remarkable.  However, I can't comment on it all that well, as the version I saw was pitch black.  I guess they dropped the print in a tar pit, or something.  Everything was severely murky all the time, and it is literally impossible to make anything out at a few points.  Still, I don't think being able to see it would've helped this movie too much.

They stole the soundtrack from 'Dawn of the Dead', and don't use it very well.  That soundtrack was kinda a mixed bag, definitely some of Goblin's weakest work, but the real problem is that they totally don't know how to use it.  The music is frequently highly inappropriate to the scene.  Still, some of it is pretty cool.

There's quite a bit of hilarious dubbing, but the movie as whole is a bit too slow moving, with mundane zombie carnage, which makes it not totally work on a camp level.  Still, I was never terribly bored, and more or less amused most of the time, so I can't help but tell other Italian/Zombie horror fans to check it out.  But, it is pretty damn crappy, no doubt about it.

7864765,2,6304184689,"this movie was bad. the characters are taken right from dawn of the dead, just like some of goblins music. this movie wants to be dawn of the dead SOOO Bad, but it's a movie easily forgotten, only to be revisited and talked about by people who agree that it was crap. the only good thing about the movie was i'll admit some of the gore was good, and some zombie hordes weren't a let down, like the end",1120867200,3,401,4.0886075949367084
7864766,3,6304184689,"A reviewer brings up a good point in making us aware that the information listed for the video on this page is for the Joel M. Reed 'Night of the Zombies' and not the Bruno Mattei/Vincent Dawn 'Night of the Zombies'. He misses the point that the reason everybody else has reviewed the Bruno Mattei 'Night of the Zombies' on this page is because that is what they got when they ordered a copy. This is the only listing for 'Night of the Zombies' and the Bruno Mattei film is more common and popular than the Joel M. Reed Film. If you look in the used and new section you will find both movies. You need to examine the listing carefully to make certain which movie you are ordering. Unfortunately when two movies have the same name, this causes quite a bit of confusion in the listing, especially when both movies are obviously the same subject; and it does not help that they share the same release year (although I believe the Reed film was made several years before it found a release and a place on Elvira's show). Reed's film is about Nazi zombies (not to be confused with 'Oasis of the Zombies') who apparently have nothing better to do than battle each other (while plotting to take over the world?) while being investigated by an ex-porn star playing a CIA man. Mattei's film is about Interpol commandos on the island of New Ginuea who end up babysitting a reporter and cameraman while fighting zombies on their way to the Hope Center, a synthetic nourishment plant, where a freak accident started this situation. I would rate Mattei's film at 3 stars just for its entertainment value and Reed's film at two stars for its lack of the same, but it is a good movie to poke fun at (why do you think Elvira ran it). Reed's film is low on the gore scale and Mattei's film is high on the gore and repulsion scale. By the way, if the name Joel M. Reed sounds familiar, think 'Bloodsucking Freaks'.--Bob",1103760000,4,1901,4.4498567335243555
