It's beautiful but, standard DVD just doesn't do it justice.  These cycling videos must be in Blu-ray to really enjoy them.",1431907200,,242,4.4772727272727275
8646595,5,B00IYTDGPK,"I like this video a lot because Ive been to Santa Barbara and it really captured the best beachfront area from the best angle coming down from the park on the hill above.  I respectfully disagree with the other reviewer that complained about traffic.  Well, if theyve ever actually ridden a bike in any semi-urban area at all, theyve had to put up with a lot more traffic than you ever see in these rides. I truly get the impression that whoever makes these Bike-O-Vision journeys takes a heck of a lot of care to avoid traffic while still being able to take us through some of the most popular places.
  Besides, that other reviewer probably doesnt cycle, because if they did, they would also know that bike paths on beaches can be some of the more annoying places to try and workout with all the joggers and beach-goers constantly crossing your path.  You can never really get going fast.  A friend of mine was involved with a collision with a dog on one said beach path that sent him to the emergency room for a broken collar bone!  Ill take my chances on the road with the other real cyclists, thank you very much.
  For example in this video the long stretch along Newport Beach is just right for getting a really even cadence going!  Also interesting in this dvd is the ride through the Danish-themed village of Solvang- how quaint!  And there were other nice parts, but I must stress that I do not agree with that other negative reviewer- this ones well worth the asking price!",1412035200,,1484,4.479553903345725
8646596,3,B00IYTDGPK,"This is meant as a bike ride but it's clearly filmed from a car and moves much faster than other biking videos. In fact you'll notice yourself passing all the people on bicycles. Your ride will be limited to the areas a car can travel on aka the roadways. If you're looking for something off the beaten path, this is not it. If you want to ride through traffic then you'll love this video. While it's not terrible, in my opinion there are better cycling videos out there.",1400371200,,471,4.363636363636363
