8022719,3,B00026L84O,The first in the trio was pretty good the others were just OK  The dealer on the other hand was excellent to deal with!,1370390400,,119,3.9583333333333335
8022720,4,B00026L84O,"The first two DVD's in the set are nothing but trauma and major medical related incidents. The footage is graphic, so if you do not like the sight of blood, death and disfigurement then do not buy this DVD set. The third DVD does have traumas, but a good bit of the footage shows what is going on in the back of the ambulance while transporting the patient to the hospital. However, I am about to start EMT school and I actually found that the DVD's showed what really goes on some trauma situations. I was told though that in the real EMS world that only about 5% of all EMS calls are serious traumas like those that are shown in these DVD's, so don't think that this is what every call a EMT or Paramedic handles is like. There is no narration and it is filmed like the show COPS. I personally think the DVD's are interesting and is good for anyone considering going into EMS.",1289088000,,878,4.263473053892215
8022721,4,B00026L84O,"The footage in this video is unscripted, completely uncensored, and real.  These DVDs contain actual footage of Paramedics/EMTs/Firefighters working on trauma patients.  From horrible/fatal car accidents, shootings, stabbing call, and various trauma calls.  Volumes 1 and 2 are good, but the 3rd is not.  After viewing this video, you will think twice about driving too fast on the highway.  Some of my family members who saw the video didn't really like the bloody scenes, but they thought that it was a very interesting DVD to watch.  If you're told that the DVD is fake, it's not! I have personally been on emergency calls when I did my EMT internship, and I can tell you that it's 100% real.  Picture quality is not like today's DVDs, since it's apparent that they shot these scenes back in the 90s, but it's not too bad (it was transferred from tape to DVD).  Sound quality is not all that great either, but we all know that we're not buying these DVDs for their sound quality, but more so for the material.  The trauma scenes definitely make up for it, though.",1215388800,,1066,4.688172043010753
8022722,3,B00026L84O,the first two are very good. the last one is thrown together and has some inaccurate stories.,1181865600,,93,4.529411764705882
