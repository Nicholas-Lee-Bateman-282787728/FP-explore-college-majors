8177293,4,B000NDECF8,"This is a great series that shows what dedicated, driven (and faily rich) young people can accomplish. We are horse people so this was exceptionally inspirational for my child and I. You need to know that the DVDs are a bit expensive for what they are and the quality is really poor. But if you or your child compete in the hunter/jumper world this series is a fun way to spend time.",1371686400,,383,4.333333333333333
