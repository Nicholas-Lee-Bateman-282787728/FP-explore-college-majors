8364609,1,B002CXJI2O,This DVD is a joke. There is no voice or visual quality. It is like an ameteur video.,1266624000,,85,3.7777777777777777
8364610,5,B002CXJI2O,"My three-year-old daughter at first thought this dvd was too hard, but it's so fun to watch that she stuck with it and just makes a little improvement each time she watches it. She already knows the ballet terms and what they mean, and her improvised ""around the house"" dancing now has a balletic look to it. She prefers this DVD over her other ballerina DVD because Caterina is *really* charismatic. Watching my daughter stretch and plie for fun is so cute!

I'm very happy with this DVD. I bought the DVD to improve activity during the winter, and it's already inspiring her to dance around the house.",1256083200,3,603,4.583333333333333
8364611,5,B002CXJI2O,"My girlfriend's 4 year old loves Prima Princessa...so I gave her a copy of Caterina Ballerina for her birthday.  My friend said she loved it!  She was immediately taken in by ""cat power"", and kept asking her mom to replay the dvd.  My friend said she loved it because it not only gave her daughter exposure to classic ballet moves, but to the technical language as well -  which provides her with a stronger foundation when in class.  Highly recommended!!",1245283200,3,455,4.6375
8364612,5,B002CXJI2O,I highly recommend this unique DVD to your aspiring little ballerinas.  My five-year old daughter tells me that dancing along with Caterina is more fun than her ballet class.  This DVD captures the beauty and magic of ballet.  We never get tired of watching it!,1245283200,2,261,4.7555555555555555
