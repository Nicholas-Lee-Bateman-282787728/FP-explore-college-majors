3896226,3,B002BWOZ1A,"An odd little film: Inside the home and the mind of an old man who was a body guard to Hitler. Living literally with his memories he has forged an identity for himself out of the ruins of his life. Through the interviews with the daughter and the housekeeper with a person off screen, one expects the first to thoughtfully, just as one expects the second to casually drop a bomb shell, and they do, but not in the manner one expected. Requires some thought, and there's no happy ending. Might merit 2nd viewing.",1337558400,12,511,4.446808510638298
3896227,4,B002BWOZ1A,"I am greatly interested in factual information related to ww2 Hitler Stalin Roosvelt, and Churchill. I enjoyed the dvd. Not as much historical information as I would have liked but still I enjoyed it.",1337299200,3,200,4.911764705882353
3896228,3,B002BWOZ1A,"The film (DVD) follows Rochus Misch, the last living survivor (witness) as to Hitler and the final days in the Fhrerbunker in Berlin (1945). Given the fact Misch was born in 1917, he still has a sound mind and gets around pretty well. The film shows his modest home in Berlin where he has lived these many years. His devoted housekeeper is interviewed and she gives her views on Misch and Hitler. She tells how there is a disconnect between what she learned in school and the stories Misch has told her.

The best part of the film is when Misch is going through his old wartime photos and tells anecdotal stories about the people and places shown. There was not enough time spent on that in the film. The filmmakers spent a lot of time interviewing Misch's adult daughter and showing how she views things differently from her father. I will say it is of some interest to show the family dynamitics in relation to Germany's past, but again, I would have liked to hear more as to Misch's interactions with Hitler and ""the inner circle"". In the end, the World War II buff and student of German history will find the film interesting, keeping in mind the caveat mentioned above.",1302480000,12,1174,4.537735849056604
3896229,5,B002BWOZ1A,"This is a really an amazing story. The filmmakers made an excellent research work to bring us this story.
The editing of this documentary really will not let off your eyes of the screen. I am sure there is a lot similar stories like this one and they just waiting to be revealed, till then, you must watch this movie.",1248048000,4,317,4.3
3896230,5,B002BWOZ1A,"This is an amazing story of the man who lived in Hitler's court, working as his telephone operator and bodyguard, tells a Jewish woman from Israel about the final years of Hitler's life, about his last hours. Thrilling untold story.",1247616000,4,232,4.825

8362207,5,B002BWOZ1A,Remarkable first hand insight into Hitler's personal world by a man who was there day in and day out. The hundreds of candid pictures taken by this subordinate give and interesting account of the private life of Hitler and his cronies.,1407888000,,235,4.7560975609756095

8362209,5,B002BWOZ1A,"This man is the Last person alive on Earth to have served close to Hitler as his personal bodyguard and assistant. He clearly describes the other side of Hitler, which at the least helps to put Hitler in the realm of a human being. It is interesting to hear accounts of how Hitler's private and personal side was rather polite and kind, but how his other side was that of cruel Monster. This Man never got to see first hand the Evil cruel side of Hitler, therefore he can only speak of what his experience was. It was just his post as a personal aid to Hitler and he was not given inside info about Hitler's master plan. In his mind he may have questioned the integrity of things, but his job was not to ask questions.",1405209600,2,718,4.248175182481752
8362210,1,B002BWOZ1A,"I stopped watching this flick after three minutes and twenty seconds, the time it took for the main character to announce that he took photographs of Hitler, and for the second character to be filmed walking down a deserted street, enter a house, take off her coat and announce that she had bought some carrots.  If this was to be an hour-long documentary it wasn't going to waste anymore of my time by filming nothing but fluff, which has or had nothing to do with the Second World War.  It took more than three minutes for the film to convey one line, and only one line, that the main character took photos of Hitler, and from what I saw, not very good photos.  There may be something worthwhile here, but I don't have the time to find it. These filmmakers don't pass documentary 101,",1391299200,,786,4.444444444444445

AND frankly the daughter (shudder) was a cocky wench also.......being quiet, to this one, is a WEAKNESS......

Yeah, this guy wasn't the sharpest pencil in the box........but, of the three, he DEFINATELY seems to be the most likable.",1380672000,,440,5.083333333333333
8362212,3,B002BWOZ1A,"I watched this video a couple of times before I made another trip to Germany. Kind of on a whim I stopped by Herr Misch's house in Berlin to see if I could meet with him. His housekeeper (the same lady in the film) let me in and we had lunch and chatted about all kinds of stuff. I mentioned that I had seen this video and Herr MIsch laughed and commented that he thought it turned out to be a ""stupid comedy"".

It was a fascinating conversation and I was sorely disappointed with how much interesting stuff was just completely left out of the video in lieu of family drama, etc. The stories that I heard were so much more interesting than the ones on the DVD.",1376870400,35,660,4.15625
8362213,3,B002BWOZ1A,"PLOT: one of the last Nazis alive from Hitler's Bunker Talks~

a former Nazi ~ one of Hitler's ""telephone"" operators~ is still alive and a Tel Aviv TV group film him for interviews. This is a DOCUMENTARY. The gentleman in the film is in his 90s and very alert and intelligent and (articulate). He has a treasure trove of photos from both Hitler and Ava Braun and the Hitler inner circle. HIS story is good but he ""loves"" the attention and it shows. He comes across as a very likeable man who has a bit of history to share. He does enlightening details about the LAST hours in the BUNKER for Hitler and Braun and even Goebbels and his family. He has become a local ""celebrity"" of a sorts. His daughter is also interviewed and she speaks very good English. She was born in the 1940's. Her Father was in prison for years and she clearly picked up anti Nazi feelings from her Family and EDUCATION. She is not closed to her father and she speaks out about it. THE HOUSEKEEPER is the third person interviewed and we see her busy ""cleaning"" what is amazing is her ATTITUDE that history is wrong and the EX NAZI is right about the killing of the Jews. This is both SAD and interesting. This is told mostly in German with excellent subtitles. I would recommend it as a CHARACTER STUDY on history. I give it 3 out of 5 for both interesting people and attitudes to the ""same subject"". worth wataching ONCE~",1374796800,9,1395,4.386100386100386

8362215,3,B002BWOZ1A,WWII documentaries usually fascinate me but this one did not hole my interest.  Not sure why but it wasn't what I expected.  Perhaps it was too 'clinical.',1356566400,,155,4.703703703703703
