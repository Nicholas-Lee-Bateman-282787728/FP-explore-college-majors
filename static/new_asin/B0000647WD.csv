8329550,5,B0000647WD,"Been looking for this as a DVD  for years because I used it a long time ago & really liked it. Bought this DVD thinking I could view it in the US but it wouldn't play. Totally crushed, I then problem solved by buying a vhs of it then sending it to a digital resource specialist which can make a dvd from it (legal under fair use laws).  You can also dub it on your dvd/vhs player to make a dvd of it. Why all this bother  for one dvd? Because I really like this workout. The steps are easy for me to do & I like the pacing. I just put on my own rock & roll music (which helps with the monotomy of the moves) and go. None of the confusion, frustration & utter exhaustion of other exercise workouts that leave me feeling like an uncoordinated, frustrated failure. It feels nice to workout to & I can feel I get a great workout. I can be a success with this workout! And let me tell you my weight just MELTED OFF. I also like how I can add levels with the step to increase my exercise level, which is very helpful to get over plateaus & to keep on losing weight when you have a lot to lose. I love Susan Powter!",1437350400,5,1108,3.9375

I have had the VHS tape for years and I love this work out video, I thought I hit pay dirt when I finally saw the DVD.  It was a little confusing seeing the copy in english, I just didn't read far enough.  Click/purchase....My mistake.  I want to state though that the company was very quick in responding to my request to return it, they provided a U.S. address for me to ship it to and assured me that when they receive the DVD back in Germany, they will refund my money.  I just shipped it back last week so I have a little more time to wait until the refund is processed.",1423008000,2,693,4.0661764705882355
