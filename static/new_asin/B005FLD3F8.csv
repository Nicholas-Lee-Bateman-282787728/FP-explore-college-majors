8470223,2,B005FLD3F8,I didn't find anything worth keeping this film for. If the people behind it HAD to get rid of money... it'd have been better spent just giving it to ME!! This movie is NOT one I'd choose to see over again!,1364601600,,205,4.024390243902439
8470224,1,B005FLD3F8,"This video was previously  promoted as ""The Get Down"" for approximately six years it never made the big screen with this title. Some genius rechristened the same schlock video ""The Chick Magnet"" hoping the movie may have a chance with a new title. It did hit the air waves on late, late, late night filler for cable the genre was listed as a ""comedy,"" but given no star rating, this should have been a hint of what to follow. The movie opens with tasteless toilet humor, the acting was excruciatingly painful and the rest of the ""plot"" fell into a humongous sink hole or should I say ""stink hole?"" The biggest accomplishment here is the listing of several big celebrity names across the top of the DVD box when they pop up in the film for about ten seconds each. They got Owen Wilson, Rosario Dawson, Kristen Bell, Tracy Morgan, Kristy Swanson, John Witherspoon and Kevin Smith (guess they ran out of space for Jason Mewes). Essentially what these guys did was hit up a red carpet event and do quasi interviews they did not have roles in this movie. Purely a waste of time and money. It really deserves 1/2 star at best.",1348272000,,1120,4.490196078431373
8470225,1,B005FLD3F8,"This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.  The plot is cheezy and predictable, and the execution is tremendously shoddy.  The only legit reason to watch it is the softcore porn, and even that is mediocre at best.  That leaves the Plan 9 reason; I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy watching firey train wrecks.",1320796800,,323,4.631578947368421
8470226,2,B005FLD3F8,"""Be warned, you cannot possibly understand the toll this gift exacts on the body, yes, but more gravely on the mind, on the soul."" Phil (Venables) and Jen (Cady) are getting divorced and Phil moves out. When Phil and his friends run into a stranger with a shirt with the power for any man to get any woman he wants they think they have it made. Phil decides to try and use it on his wife. This movie is pretty much exactly what you would expect from the preview. A little bit of a plot and a lot of sex. This movie has the three main characters in any good movie like this. The sensitive guy, the fat dumb guy, and the cocky guy. This is no where near the quality of the ""American Pie"" movies and is barely watchable. Ten minutes in you can predict the ending. But all this really means nothing. When you watch a movie like this you watch it for one thing. Overall, an OK movie that runs out of laughs at about twenty minutes in. I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - I doubt it.
