8167844,5,B000MCICZG,"Here, Angelina Mouseling [voiced by Finty Williams] tries to be a prima ballerina under the coaching of Ms Lilly [Dame Judi Dench], her devoted dance instructor. However, she faces some obstacles in the form of Ms Hodgepodge, her grumpy next-door neighbor and bully Sam Watts. This release also features two live-action programs: ""Taking a Dance Exam"" and ""Dancing Like You're Doing Something Else"".

The animated stories remain faithful to the source material by Katharine Holabird, and retain the original illustrations by Helen Craig. The quality of the animation is above average, lending an almost real-life quality to the little mice, and the language is clear [British accent is used here]. In between the animated episodes, there are scenes of actual dance lessons, either ballet, folk or others.

I'd highly recommend the Angelina Ballerina series of DVDs to aspiring young dancers, those who love immersing themselves in a world inhabited by adorable little mice and this is probably suited to preschoolers and up.",1240790400,3,1024,5.314814814814815
