4339069,4,B004EPYZP8,"A slick and well-paid defense attorney takes the case of a wealthy man who is accused of assaulting a prostitute. His guilt or innocence is seriously in question early on, and the case brings into doubt the guilt of one of his previous clients who is currently imprisoned. The lead character, Mickey Haller is not very likable, but the storyline is quite engrossing. There is no dead time in the film, with the entire movie focusing on the case at hand, keeping the viewer intrigued. The resolution of the case is not seriously in question, but the journey in getting there is worth the trip.",1300924800,2,592,4.647619047619048
4339070,5,B004EPYZP8,"which is a good thing. The actors hit their spots and this feels great. All characters are less than perfect. Some are evil. Real lawyers can say it feels real. Can't ask for more from a movie like this. Good actors in even the small parts, which is a testament to their belief in the movie. Liked it a lot.",1300579200,2,307,4.133333333333334
4339071,5,B004EPYZP8,"""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Mickey Haller is a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney who operates out of the back of his Lincoln sedan. Haller has spent most of his career defending garden-variety criminals, until he lands the case of his career: defending Louis Roulet, a Beverly Hills playboy accused of rape and attempted murder. But the seemingly straightforward case suddenly develops into a deadly game of survival for Haller.

The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (excellent as Mickey Haller) is excellent. The directing by Brad Furman (who also directed ""The Take"" (2007) is excellent. The screenplay (based on Michael Connelly's novel) by John Romano (who also wrote the screenplay to ""The Third Miracle"" (1999), ""Nights In Rodanthe"" (2008) & the story to ""Intolerable Cruelty"" (2003) is excellent.

The film editing by Jeff McEvoy (who also did the film editing to ""Wonderland"", ""Turistas"" (2006), ""Swing Vote"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Cat Run"" (2011) is excellent.

This is an excellent thriller that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is an entertaining and well-crafted movie. Matthew McConaughey gives one of the best performances, if not, the best performance, of his career, thus far.",1300492800,2,3257,5.36986301369863

4339373,4,B004EPYZP8,"There's solid writing here and Mcconaughey really delivers the goods. It's also got a fantastic supporting cast. Although, Phillipe is a bit underwhelming in his role. The film's main offense is it's third act. It's tremendously convoluted and overstays its welcome. There are far too many plot turns packed into a meager 10-15 minute span. For instance, the biker gang thread seemed disposable, just more clutter. And a last minute reveal is not appropriately prepared for or ever really explained (w/r/t character motivation) -- worse, it's unnecessary. All in all, it's a pretty compelling yarn that's hampered by its break-neck pace and an overlong, ill-constructed third act.",1519776000,,680,5.364485981308412

4339473,4,B004EPYZP8,"Revisiting this film based on the Michael Connelly bestseller of the same name was a treat.  While not a faithful retelling of the book the big screen version is entertaining in its own right.  L.A. attorney Michael J. (Mickey or Mick) Haller is a savvy defender of sleaze balls and bottom feeders.  He lost his drivers license in a DUI and works out of the back of a Lincoln Continental (hence the title) driven by his part time chauffer Earl.  Haller gets involved in the case of a wealthy young playboy accused of murdering a prostitute.  There are plenty of twists and turns along the way and the story holds your attention.

  Matthew McConaughey,plays Mick Haller with flair, his presentation is a bit slicker than Connellys depiction but it works well here.  Unfortunately, clocking in at just under two hours theres not a lot of time for character development.  Hallers investigator played by William H. Macy and one ex-wife and ADA played by Marissa Tomei are fairly fleshed out but everyone else is pretty one-dimensional.  For example Hallers other ex-wife Lorna is in the movie but her role is miniscule here and if you didn't read the screen credits you wouldnt know she appeared at all.  In the novels she has a much greater part running Micks admin side of things.

  All in all The Lincoln Lawyer is a good time that will keep you guessing even if you read the book.  It would have been a good franchise vehicle for McConaughey,or even turned into a TV series.",1518048000,,1476,4.662790697674419

4339690,4,B004EPYZP8,"The Lincoln Lawyer stars Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club) as Mick Haller, a smooth Los Angeles criminal defense attorney, who cruises the streets in his mobile office  a Lincoln Town Car. Hes adept at using his Southern accent and self-assured swagger to charm assorted members of the legal system.

Hallers ex-wife (Marisa Tomei) works in the DAs office, but he prefers to work in the lower levels of the court system. His bail bondsman friend (John Leguizamo) brings him his latest case: Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), a rich Beverly Hills child of privilege accused of beating up a prostitute. The arrogant Roulet treats the charges against him lightly, and refuses to accept a plea deal, insisting on his innocence despite incriminating evidence.

McConaughey made this film after a series of lightweight romantic comedies, and it showcases an acting ability beyond merely smiling, making wisecracks, and doing at least one scene bare-chested. The character of Haller is complex, and the script takes some interesting and unanticipated turns.  The supporting cast of Phillippe, Leguizamo, Tomei, Brian Cranston, Michael Pena, and William H. Macy (as Hallers private investigator) are excellent, adding stature to this legal thriller. There are some convenient coincidences in the plot but, for the most part, the story builds suspense and keeps us involved.

Bonus materials on the R-rated 2-disc 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray Combo Pack include the featurettes Making the Case: Creating The Lincoln Lawyer, At Home on the Road, and One On One with Matthew McConaughey and writer Michael Connelly; and deleted scenes. A digital HD copy is enclosed. Other editions available are single-disc Blu-ray and single-disc DVD.",1502928000,,1720,5.379182156133829

4343888,4,B004EPYZP8,"Even though I read mysteries all the time, I had never read a Michael Connelly book.  That is until I learned that The Lincoln Lawyer was being made into a movie.  A few months before the film was released, I read the book.  Having watched the film, I've got to say, I am impressed with it.

Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) is a defense lawyer working in Los Angeles, California.  Since his cases are spread out all over the area, he works from his Lincoln town car.  His clients are as diverse as the drug grower for a bike gang and a prostitute addict.

But Mick thinks his ship has come in when he takes on the case of Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe).  Louis is accused of beating a woman with the intent of killing her.  Louis proclaims his innocence, and it really does look like it will be an easy win for Mick.  Just as his dreams of a big payday begin to fade, things begin to heat up and Mick realizes this case isn't going to be as simple as he thought it would be.  Can he clear Louis' name, or is Louis guilty?

As a reader, I often have a hard time with movies based on books I've read.  They leave too much out, or change things I loved.  I definitely noticed some changes here, but they were minor things.  In fact, in some cases I think it helped the flow of the story.  They certainly did a good job of taking a 400 page book, condensing it down to 2 hours, and leaving in all the twists and turns.

Of course, to do that, some things did have to be cut.  Most of the cutting involved character development.  The characters in the book were richly drawn, and they aren't nearly as real here.  Likewise, some of the twists seemed a little abrupt with little to no explanation to go along with them.  I think I actually understood the story a little better because I'd read the book.  A few things would have me scratching my head if I'd only seen the movie.  But maybe that's me being thick headed and it won't be an issue for anyone.  On the plus side, they did cut down on some parts of the book that I felt dragged.  This story is always movie forward.

When I first heard this movie was being made, I heard people complaining about the casting of Matthew McConaughey as Mick.  This is only one story with the character, and people naturally have an attachment to him.  Since I've only read the one book and it was recently, I didn't have nearly as big a problem with this casting choice.  And I thought Matthew did a great job.  He's charming, smooth, and oily at the beginning, but he delivers the weightier emotions as the story really gets going.  Likewise, Ryan Phillippe is outstanding as Louis.  Any time the scene focuses on the two of them, the dynamic between them is outstanding.  The rest of the cast delivers as well, but those two are really the stars of the film.

I wasn't at all surprised when I learned that this movie was rated R.  Between the language in the book and the sexual nature of the crime at the heart of the story, anything less would have robbed the story of so much.  Just be aware what you are getting into when you step into the theater.

Fans of The Lincoln Lawyer have nothing to worry about.  I don't know how we could have gotten a better film version of the book.  And if you are new to the story, you'll find an entertaining thrill ride that will made you want to search out more of Michael Connelly's books.",1432080000,,3368,4.268987341772152

4344832,4,B004EPYZP8,"The Lincoln Lawyer

 Many movie mavens have long suspected that Matthew McConaughey might well have the capacity to be a great dramatic actor.  In The Lincoln Lawyer the suspicion becomes fact. We can no longer discount McConaughey as just a pretty face, just someone to fill in the male half of romantic comedies.  This movie is great fun, interesting to watch, very well written and performed by a truly outstanding cast with flawless acting.
 The first kudos must go to the writer, John Romano.  Romano also penned the successful and fascinating Intolerable Cruelty.  The Lincoln Lawyer has enough twists and turns for even the most jaded mystery junky.  McConaughey plays the lawyer.  His client might well be innocent of the murder for which he is charged.  The Lawyer is haunted by the possibility that he might not be able to save an innocent man, a threat that hangs like a shroud over his professional life.  Romanos script keeps the surprises coming and the intensity building until the very last frame.
 We begin to view the film with an introduction to the McConaughey character.  He is a streetwise young lawyer with the typical McConaughey swagger and confidence and a relentless, unprincipled ambition.  As the plot is reveled, we see him fold in on himself as the pressures of the case squeeze in on him until we find him pouring down desperate quaffs of Alka-Seltzer.
 Oscar winner Marisa Tomei plays his ex but still affectionate wife.  To see her is to be reminded exactly why she has been nominated for the Academy Award on three occasions.
 William H. Macy gets to play a gritty, long haired investigator who is the right hand man to the lawyer.  Other excellent efforts can be awarded to both Ryan Phillippe and especially to John Leguizamo, the latter as a truly slimy bail bondsman.
 This is absolutely the best lawyer film in several years and is arguably the best Matthew McConaughey role ever.  This outstanding film lasts almost exactly two hours.  It is rated R for adult situations, murder and language.  With a $40 million budget and worldwide receipts of only $58 million, the film is bringing in much less than it deserves or that will please the producers.  The Lincoln Lawyer is nearing the end of its theatrical release.  You should see this four saw blade film while you have the chance.",1424044800,,2324,4.8106060606060606

With no shoot-outs, car chases or whiz-bang special effects, the film has to rely, most refreshingly, on the quality of the acting, plot and the direction. McConaughey plays the central role of the coolly professional defence lawyer with understated aplomb and the plot is sufficiently twisty (though, unfortunately, by no means totally unpredictable) for the narrative to remain engaging. There is also a lovely, almost old-fashioned, stylishness to this film which perfectly matches the consistently managed pace.

4345435,4,B004EPYZP8,"Great Movie.  A well-written fast-paced, suspenseful thriller with a masterful chess game of wits between killer and attorney.
It's a fascinating peak behind the scenes of the criminal legal system and how one educated man 'rolling on the streets' not only uses his education to succeed but his gut and street sense to be the master player of all.  You hate him but love him too,  I hate that!  RRRR  Probably, why I have a history of picking the wrong men!  Oh...,.about the movie.,..

Mathew McConaughey aces his part as Mick, Defense Attorney and America's favorite Marisa Tomei makes you love her all over again, Matthew Ryan Phillippe - wow, just wow!  A well- crafted cast leaves no room for disappointment.

thus far have been about surfer dudes (seriously, the 2008 film was called Surfer, Dude), adventurers (as
in the 2005 film Sahara or the 2008 blunder Fools Gold), or a seemingly endless string of garden variety
fluffy romance comedies (reallya ton of those, like 2006 Failure to Launch or 2003 How to Lose a Guy in
Ten Days). It was in fact 2003 since Ive seen him in something because everything that hes been in has
not been my taste. Whose taste do they appeal to? Im not sure, but I am certain that somebody reading
this will say, Who is this guy (meaning me) to bust on my Matthew? What a hunk he is (meaning that
guycertainly not me)!
Then there comes The Lincoln Lawyer. In this film, McConaughey plays a defense attorney who loves his
work of getting the scum of the earth out of sticky legal situations. He makes his office in the back of a
dated Lincoln Continental, where he has a driver escorting him around after a DUI incident a number of
months back. So I love the premise, which shows great promise. But Matthew McConaughey? Do you
mean you're really going to get me into a theater where a Matthew McConaughey film is playing?
As if the premise wasn't enough to lure me in, the film stars Marisa Tomei. Heck, I don't even have to
like a movie to enjoy Marisa in it. Look at last years Cyrus? What an odd, too odd to like, movie. But did
I like her in it? Well And Ive always like William H. Macy, whose characters are convincing and his
delivery although in the same vein flows differently every time. He cleans up well, and he gets grungy
well too.
The Lincoln Lawyer delivers. And Im not just saying that because I like legal thrillers (and lets not kid
ourselves, thats all this is), but this does not sacrifice story for stereotypeand McConaughey (here it
is, hes going to say it) pulls off his characters tormented and trapped nature beautifully. Wow! Have
things changed for McConaughey? Will I rush to see his next movie? I guess time will tell.",1408406400,,2067,4.442105263157894

4347434,3,B004EPYZP8,"Good actors and acting.  The story was one of those overly contrived Hollywood tales.  Where the movie wants to go guides the story instead of the other way around.  It has the characters ""showing off"" too much and, as a result, the story just doesn't ring true.  Some may like this kind of ""showy"" movie.",1403827200,,305,4.490909090909091

The after shock will last for a good time, you even might pray and force yourself to believe that every one in prison had a good first hand Attorney, handsomely paid, that did everything for their client but since they were guilty and Lady Justice is blind so they are in prison for good . You also want to force yourself to think that District Attorneys do not get evaluated by the number of their convictions, or that public defender did more than just a 15 minutes looking at each case out of 400 cases they are given and none are fresh out of school with no experience. You are not into finding what is going on that will have effect on you, your family, you children and their children and so on this is still a good movie with some good twists that can only be learned from an Attorney.",1403827200,,878,4.170588235294118
4347436,4,B004EPYZP8,Great movie but it was ridiculous that I had to pay around $4 for such an old movie.  Amazon Prime sucks compared to Netflix and streaming Redbox. You even have to pay to watch television series. Huge Ripoff.,1403568000,,208,4.473684210526316
4347437,5,B004EPYZP8,I didn't know that this movie was made based on a set of books.  I enjoyed story and the actors were very believable.

4347624,5,B004EPYZP8,ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT! This movie is just too cool! MM is a  loosey goosey lawyer when he gets into a real mess threatening even his family.

I highly recommend it.",1394323200,,178,4.59375
4348501,1,B004EPYZP8,Not worth watcing because of the language. Why do people think there has to be fowl language in a movie for it to be any good? That ruins the whole movie.,1394323200,,154,4.0
4348502,5,B004EPYZP8,"Not a real deep movie.  But, it's fun and it kept my interest throughout.  I recommend it for just sheer entertainment value.",1394236800,,125,4.636363636363637
4348503,3,B004EPYZP8,"This is a good adaptation of Michael Connelly's Lincoln Lawyer series.  It's not exactly as I pictured it, but what hollywood
production does.  McConaughey comes across as even better than Connelly writes Haller.",1394236800,,213,5.424242424242424
4348504,4,B004EPYZP8,"the Mike Haller series is fast-paced with snappy dialogue and a twisting mystery. movie stays with the book so wait before watching if you just read the book. If you haven't read this series, each is a new, fresh, mystery with the characters evolving as each new story is written. For quick, enjoyable reads, can't be beat. Michael McG is a good selection for the book's main character as are the rest of the actors/actresses.",1393804800,,426,4.693333333333333
4348505,5,B004EPYZP8,"McConaughey nails the title character and the movie follows the book pretty well. I'd say this is a ""must see"".",1393804800,,111,4.6
4348506,3,B004EPYZP8,"I thought the writer got the salient details of the original book by Michael Conelly, and I thought Conaughy (sp.?) rendered the part of Micky Haller very convincingly.  I didn't like his southern accent, not having heard such an accent in the voice of the reader whose work I have so much enjoyed in listening to the Harry Bosch/Micky Haller series on CDs.  The action moments and the rest of the cast were superb!",1393632000,,415,4.594594594594595
4348507,5,B004EPYZP8,I enjoyed this one too.  McConaughey seems at home in all sorts of parts and a free lance lawyer for hire suits him real fine.  Terrific.,1393545600,,137,4.230769230769231

4348509,5,B004EPYZP8,"Really enjoyed this movie.  I am going back to watch McConaughey movies for the first time after getting hooked on True Detective and seeing McConaughey interview on Inside the Actors Studio.  Only down side is there are so many more of his movies to watch now, but this was a great place to start!",1393286400,,298,4.5

4348704,5,B004EPYZP8,"I loved the book, but was worried McConaughey couldn't play Mickey Haller, but he pulled it off.  Really enjoyed it",1392595200,,115,4.75

4348706,5,B004EPYZP8,"This was a favorite book of mine from Michael Connelly.  McConaughey  is the perfect Mikey Haller.  Now if the Bosch series
is picked up I think Connelly fans will be truly indebted to Amazon instant video.
Again...thanks Amazon",1392508800,,228,4.947368421052632
4348707,5,B004EPYZP8,"This company is trustworthy. I ordered the DVD plus Blue-ray version, and I received just the blue-ray version. I contacted the seller, and they responded promptly and mailed me the correct version immediately and let me keep the one they initially sent anyway. I got a present for myself, and my dad got an additional Christmas gift!!",1392422400,,335,4.894736842105263

4348709,5,B004EPYZP8,"This movie written by Michael Connelly and starring Matthew was intriguing and gave the viewer quite a ride. All the characters were at their best found this to be an entertaining film.  Film for adults, some violence, not for children.",1392249600,,236,4.9
4348799,5,B004EPYZP8,Excellent movie and plot. Mathew is awesome as always. A definite must see especially for Michael Connelly fans. Great movie,1392249600,,124,5.25
4348800,4,B004EPYZP8,"Despite the recent ascent of Matthew McConaughey in America's acting pantheon, my expectations for The Lincoln Lawyer were not correspondingly elevated. But The Lincoln Lawyer was very decent entertainment. This is not the remarkable McConaughey we have seen in recent films (perhaps starting with the fantastic Mud), but it is quite engaging and highly recommended. There is a fun story and it is snappily edited.",1392249600,,414,5.384615384615385

4348803,5,B004EPYZP8,"I saw this again last night and it holds up beautifully.  Connelly should be very pleased and ready to sign on for a series of Mickey Haller films.  This is smooth, effective filmmaking: a strong plot, exceptional actors, top production values and just enough sex and violence to earn the R without distracting us unnecessarily.

Matthew McConaughey plays Mickey Haller to a fare-thee-well.  He is defending a decadent sleazeball and, in return, pocketing a tidy fee.  At the same time his heart is breaking over the fact that he struck a plea deal for a former client who, he now knows, was innocent.  The man is rotting in San Quentin and will likely spend 15 years of his life there.  Suddenly it hits him: the sleazeball he is currently defending may well have perpetrated the murder for which his other, falsely-accused client, took the fall.  This guy likes to kill women and then watch others serve time for it.  He also likes to entrap his lawyer, who is bound by attorney-client privilege rules.  Mick has to get the sleazeball off but, simultaneously, he has to also see him convicted and his prior client freed.

How will he do that?  Thats the nub of the mystery.  In the process he will be supported by his ex-wife Maggie (Marisa Tomei), his investigator (William H. Macey) and the head of a biker gang (Trace Adkins).  This is delicious L.A. crime narrative.  If you haven't seen it yet, a significant treat awaits you.",1391990400,,1433,4.698795180722891
4348804,4,B004EPYZP8,"I first saw The Lincoln Lawyer on cable TV and liked it sufficiently to purchase both the book and the dvd. Both arrived as promised and in tip top condition from Amazon.

I have since read the book by Michael Connelly which truly reflects the movie, which is a pleasant surprise. I have re-run the movie several times because it shows an aspect to the way some people might practice the law in LA

I am a fan of both Marisa Tomei and Matthew McConaughey and enjoyed both of their performances in this movie.

I am tempted to purchase and read other stories in the series and if they are as good as this one I hope that additional movies can be made of them.

4349572,5,B004EPYZP8,The Lincoln Lawyer is a great movie that went under the radar when it was in theaters.  This movie showcases  Marisa Tomei and Matthew McConaughey's acting skills.  Matthew McConaughey will likely get an academy award nomination this year for his performance in Dallas Buyers Club.  This movie shows his growth as an actor.  The movie is a thiller that features great character actors as well like country music star Trace Adkins.  The movie is well constructed and had me into it from the first scene on.

This one has the unique concept of a criminal trial lawyer that doesn't really have an office, other than his Lincoln town car.  Most of his clients are guilty as sin and the one thing he is most worried about is having an innocent client.  The right thing to do in that case would be a complete acquittal--not something he usually tries to achieve.  This one has some crazy twists and turns, a decent amount of suspense and the acting is mostly really good.",1385510400,2,617,4.37719298245614

4349686,4,B004EPYZP8,"This movie perfectly meets the requirements of the genre, and the only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that the genre itself -- slick, plot-driven, ""sting"" movie -- is a pretty easy thing to do and doesn't really stretch the actors all that much.  I enjoyed the novel on which this movie was based, and now, about 4 years later, I've gotten round to the movie.  It does justice to the tone, spirit and much of the detail of the movie.  The cast is absolutely up to the job -- McConaughy, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Ryan Philippe, and, in a small role, Bryan Cranston -- all are fine, as are the less well-known supporters.  If I had to pick one out, I would say that Macy brings something -- maybe just his look -- that you remember in a quite small role that is nonetheless important to the plot.  Pacing, camera work, music -- all apt.  So if you like plots that have more twists than a corkscrew and haven't seen this one, it won't disappoint you.",1385424000,,969,4.2967032967032965
4349687,5,B004EPYZP8,Matthew McConaughey played the character well.  I read the book and for the most part the actors were a good match for the characters in the book.  There are always some changes from the book to the movie.... but that's to be expected.  It was exciting and action filled.,1385337600,,271,4.489795918367347

4349689,5,B004EPYZP8,"An excellent movie with Mathew McConaughey as a lawyer that works from a limousine.  He takes clients that many would turn down because they may not look innocent.  When he gets the wrong man off he works to see that justice prevails even if it may mean he is disbarred.

4349690,4,B004EPYZP8,I like McConaughey so right there may make me a little biased. Still it was a good flick and entertaining. A little over the top but it made me laugh.,1385078400,,150,4.033333333333333
4349691,4,B004EPYZP8,An interesting story with unexpected twists and turns.  Main star is so good in this movie.  We continue to see it over and over for this reason.  A believable drama.,1384300800,,166,4.466666666666667

4349765,5,B004EPYZP8,Fast shipping. Dvd is great quality. Son-in-law loves it. Was his Christmas present last year. Matthew has the looks and the brains to pull off the savvy kind of lawyer that this role requires-someone asked to do the wrong thing for the wrong reason and find a way to exonerate himself  yet make sure his client gets justice in the end. Great movie.,1383782400,,349,4.5396825396825395
4349766,5,B004EPYZP8,"While this plot has been used very sparingly - once on Matlock - it is still a fantastic movie.  Matthew McConaughey is strong as a criminal attorney and knows how not to alienate those that many would be afraid of - burly bikers!  The movie is action packed even though you can guess at what is coming next in parts of the movie, but the twists at the end are unexpected.
Definitely rent or buy this movie, expecially if you are a Matthew McConaughey fan.",1383696000,,456,4.352941176470588

4349774,4,B004EPYZP8,Lincoln Lawyer is a pretty good film based on a terrific set of books by Michael Connelly.  The time limit afforded by the film media is just not enough time to fully develop the plot and characters as much as I would have liked.  It still provides a very nice evening's entertainment.  I have read the book again after the film.  I recommend reading the book before watching the film.  I think it will add to the enjoyment of the film.,1382572800,,436,4.333333333333333

4349975,4,B004EPYZP8,Love hate with Mr. McConaughey. He adopts the southern lawyer role easily and performs to the scripts standard. I believe he delivered what was asked of him in this thriller. Not the best movie of the year but you will be satisfied with watching.,1382400000,,246,4.613636363636363

4349980,2,B004EPYZP8,"This movie was ok but it was not what I expected. I thought the plot was about something else- perhaps a lawyer that lost his corporate job but kept operating out of his car for the good of the community- and i was disappointed.

4350112,5,B004EPYZP8,"The Lincoln Lawyer, 2011 film

A man gets out of a car and enters a secured place. Another man talks to him about a criminal case. He talks to a bailiff about a defendant; the trial is held over. Lawyer Michael Haller stops his car to talk about that case. Haller visits his next client; ""it was a set-up"". The man is accused of beating a woman, but gets out on bail. Haller knows how to handle the press! He names his price to the family lawyer. A young woman is fingerprinted and processed. Haller arrives to advise her and learns what happened. Her customer paid in drugs not money, then she was caught. Haller talks to the prosecutor and makes a deal: his client will walk if she gives up this wanted man. Louis Roul is out, Haller meets his mother. Roul insists he is innocent, and tells his story. Note the differences in the point of view! Investigator Frank will check out the client's story. \

Haller gets a ride home. Next morning Frank brings in a DVD about the event. Haller shows the DVD to the prosecutor. There is a discrepancy in the discovery file. [Prosecutors have to turn over their known facts to the defense counsel.] Haller tells his client to follow orders. A detective talks to Haller about the justice system. Later Haller meets a woman and they become very friendly. Haller studies the pictures of that woman. [Note the lack of bruises on her left side.] A prisoner insists he is innocent and won't take a deal. Haller visits a prisoner and hears his story. He reconsiders this case. Was a client really innocent? Haller has a dilemma. Can Frank find other cases like this one? Roul makes a surprise visit to tell Mich something. The next day Haller learns his investigator was shot and killed at home! [Note the black blood from a body over an hour old.] Mick is upset and sees a man who could be involved.

Later Mick talks to Maggie about ""pure evil"". Mick listens to his answering machine. Frank was killed by a Colt Woodsman (a .22 automatic). Did Mick have an unsecured pistol at home? The trial of Louis Roul goes on. The police search Mick's home. They have old evidence on that Woodsman, it was a gift from Mickey Cohen. Regina Campo testifies and is cross-examined. The next day Louis Roul testifies. ""I am innocent!"" There is a rebuttal witness, a man held in jail (a ""snitch""). Why do people talk to him in jail? Can an old newspaper report affect the trial? There is a surprise ending! ""Whose side are you on?"" But there's more to come. Where is he going? There is a final confrontation. Mick knows people who can help him. There is another surprise at the end! Call 911. [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.] ""Martinez is free."" There is a repeat customer.

This story starts out as an example of the practice of criminal law, then develops into a very interesting story about a murder. There was a novel in the 1960s ""The Seventh Juror"" about a murder trial where the real murderer was an observer in the courtroom. Would he be found out in the end?",1380758400,,3017,4.420863309352518

4350118,5,B004EPYZP8,"I have to admit, my brother wanted me to see this for the longest, and I pushed it to the back of my mind, cause I didn't think that it was going to be worth the bother to watch.  Now, I was so wrong...this was a very good movie and I loved it!  Just when I thought that it was over, it wasn't.  It kept the story moving until the very end.  Matthew is a very good actor, and after his first movie, I thought that his career was going to be a lark...WRONG!!!  I think I may need to check out more of his flicks, especially if they are as entertaining as this one.  WAY TO GO!!!",1379808000,,577,3.847457627118644

I thought it was kind of refreshing considering so many movies are so involved now.  I enjoyed being able to sit and relax and watch it without a lot of constant aggressive action going on all at once.  I realize everyone's taste is different, but I wouldn't have any problem recommending it.

Update...I did go ahead and buy this.  IMO, worth watching more than just once.  At the great price I paid couldn't pass it up.",1379462400,,677,4.138461538461539
4350252,5,B004EPYZP8,"There is something so satisfying about seeing two really smart people in a battle of wits. It's one of my favorite plot devices. For me, another favorite is handsome men...and look at this cast:
  * Matthew McConaughey (""We Are Marshall"") is a slick, successful, street-wise lawyer, but he actually believes in Justice. His office is a Lincoln town car.
  * Ryan Phillippe (""Breach"") is his client, accused of rape and attempted murder. This baby-faced character presents quite a quandary: Is he or is he not guilty?
  * Josh Lucas (""Glory Road"" - I've been a fan since ""Sweet Home Alabama"") is the prosecutor confronted by death of a thousand cuts. It's not as bad as it sounds.
  * Michael Par (""Hope Floats"" and for you hard-core fans, ""Eddie and the Cruisers"") is a frustrated detective.
  * John Leguizamo (""Moulin Rouge!"") is the fast-talking street guy who pulls our hero into the game.
  * William H. Macy (""Shameless"") is our hero's right-hand man, quick, resourceful...and funny.
  * Laurence Mason (LOTS of TV) is his chauffeur; he has the best line: ""You're nobody 'til somebody shoots you!""

The female roles are mostly window dressing except for Frances Fisher (""Jolene"") who plays the accused fellow's mother; the script has plenty of laughs, with many upbeat characters and a twisty plot worth following. By the time we know what happened, we still can't see where we're going.

All in all, this is an exciting, satisfying, well-shot film with plenty of people to root for, very little profanity, no car chases and no blowie uppie stuff.",1379462400,,1553,4.89272030651341

4351371,3,B004EPYZP8,"I grew up wanting to be a lawyer as a kid. I grew up watching perhaps the best show of the 1990s, easily the best show in the drama category of that decade-The Practice, followed by its spin-off Boston Legal, as an adult. But I didn't think I'd be as interested in this movie, probably because watching a lawyer on film is different from watching one on television. But I gave it a shot. I won't exhaust you with the details of the storyline or criticize Matthew Mcconaughey (which seems to be a popular thing to do), given that there are over a thousand reviews of this movie, but I will briefly say, this is a film about a lawyer whose client turns out to be something he initially suspected and they take turns outdoing one another, which has fatal consequences.

I agree with those who gave this film a 3-star rating. I also give it a 3-star/3-1/2 star rating. It's an ok/decent film, nothing too exciting or original and not a horrible or even bad movie.",1376784000,,959,4.418079096045198

4351491,5,B004EPYZP8,"First, I enjoyed Michael McConaughey in a more serious character role.  He's funny in a comedic part, but he is well suited to playing the role of a street wise defense attorney.  He's like a 'worm protector' who is good at what he does and ensures he gets a fat check.  Usually attorneys are government wise.  The casting is good.  The story is great and you need to follow it from the start.  Justice is in the eye of the beholder so, stick with the movie till the end.  It's the drama and your own investigative thoughts that keep the suspense alive.",1376611200,,553,4.362745098039215

See if you can figure out who he is in this movie! Matthew McConaughey is a perfect fit for this part as a somewhat slimy lawyer (aren't they all?).  We watched this with our early teenage boys and had to fast forward thru a couple of inappropriate sexual scenes that the movie could've done without.

If you have read the book I think you will find this follows very close to the wit and essences of the character found there as well as the story.

This film does a good job of giving you the flavor and thrill of the book, without too much compromise on plot.  I know that honing a book and its story down to 2 hours, more or less, is daunting, but this is one of the better attempts.  McConaughey makes a better than passible Mickey Haller and Ryan Phillippe is very well cast as his dubious client.  This is one to see.",1375488000,,514,4.11

4352675,5,B004EPYZP8,"I grew up in a small rural town.  Most of what I know about city crime and criminal behavior is from movies and books.  The Lincoln Lawyer himself, Matthew McConaughey, is the epitome of city smarts.  He can handle the scumbags, the tough bikers, and on to the rich sophisticates.  He pushes the legal envelop and with the help of his great chauffeur Earl, played perfectly by Laurence Mason he is able to ride the edge in style.  The bad boy Louis Roulet will make you mad as he tries to manipulate Mick Haller, the lawyer.  Though I wouldn't call the movie a thriller, it is a great mystery story and is as much fun as was the book.

I read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it as much or more than the movie.  Like all of Michael Connelly's stories this one kept you turning the pages and hating it when you got to the last one.  The movie will keep you glued the same way.",1375228800,,879,4.153846153846154

The acting is superb -- McConaughey gives his best performance ever, and the rest of the cast is excellent, down to the supporting roles of the prison cons. The linchpin to the plot is how the Lincoln lawyer can solve his dilemma of defending a client he knows is responsible for sending another of his clients to life in prison, and the suspense builds to the very end.

As opposed to a cheeky ladies man, he plays a very deep and dynamic character that you have zero trouble sympathizing with. I have never been more impressed by him.

4353596,5,B004EPYZP8,Loved it! Wish they would make another one !it left me wanting more of him and his driver.  Matthew  McConaughey was great!  Great story.,1374192000,,137,4.625

4353598,5,B004EPYZP8,You get a gutt feeling as the case goes on the accused is not innocent.  Sure enough he is rotten to the core and Matthew has to decide if this case is worth doing the right thing. How do you stop someone you are supposed to defend.,1374105600,,232,3.9361702127659575
4353599,5,B004EPYZP8,I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie but figured I would give it a try.  Ending up being more than I expecting! Great flick,1374105600,,131,4.038461538461538
4353600,3,B004EPYZP8,Started out so so then it gets kinda slow. the end has a twist to it but nothing that aint been done before. I had time to kill it was ok for that. Glad I didn't pay theater prices for it.,1374019200,,188,3.6097560975609757
4353601,5,B004EPYZP8,Matthew McConaughey does a great job as an attorney who stands for justice.  He knows the difference between skirting the law and staying true to his core beliefs.,1374019200,,163,4.821428571428571
4353742,4,B004EPYZP8,"Matthew's performance was very earthy...I kept seeing Paul Newman. The story was excellent--not too gory--suspenseful. I liked this lawyer, character defects and all.",1374019200,,166,6.260869565217392
4353743,4,B004EPYZP8,The only real issue i have with the movie is that why did they use an old Lincoln? For some reason that bothered me. Other then that The Lincoln Lawyer is a solid adaption of a entertaining book,1374019200,,194,4.131578947368421
4353744,4,B004EPYZP8,"This is a well done screenplay and good acting. However, a trite too much sociology for my taste. Enjoyable in all.",1373932800,,115,4.523809523809524
4353745,4,B004EPYZP8,Very riveting movie on how this lawyer ends up basically being the victim of his very own client and how he still manages to see the man is punished for his crimes even though not convicted of the one that he was defending him on.  Traps him on the others.  GREAT movie!!!,1373932800,,272,4.211538461538462
4353746,3,B004EPYZP8,"Kind of predictable for most of the movie. Not bad to rent for a couple of bucks, but glad I didn't pay box office prices.",1373932800,,122,3.92

4353748,5,B004EPYZP8,"Loved it. It was fast paced and interesting and I loved all the twists and turns it took. And it has a good complete ending, a very essential thing in my book. Matthew McConaughey did a great job (and he's good lookin').",1373932800,,220,4.261904761904762

Good thriller.",1373846400,,184,4.382352941176471
4353750,4,B004EPYZP8,The movie encapsulates the prime stuff from the book and was a great sit down and watch.  A good one for sitting with the better half and appreciating the twist and turns.,1373846400,,171,4.34375
4353751,4,B004EPYZP8,"We really enjoyed the movie, especially since it is based on a Grishom novel. There were some great twists but in the end we don't know who the real killer was or if it was a team. Now we'll have to read the novel. Not a bad thing, just a necessity now. Enjoy!",1373846400,,260,3.9245283018867925

4353913,4,B004EPYZP8,"This movie seemed to be like many others with a lawyer, Matthew McConaughey, defebding scumbag clients. When a wealthy man is accused of assault and seeks him out to defend him, the story gets really good.",1373760000,,205,4.722222222222222
4353914,4,B004EPYZP8,"To early for me to say, the concept is cool and McConaughey is the right guy to be sharp enough to hold his own as an attorney and use his car for an office. It may be easy to get tired of though. If I change my mind, I'll come back and revise my review.",1373760000,,254,3.6363636363636362

4354096,3,B004EPYZP8,"The movie was not really what I expected based on the title, so it threw me off balance right from the beginning. I was an atypical lawyer movie displaying the seedier side of defending entitled criminals that are guilty. Three stars might be too generous.....",1373500800,,260,4.8
4354097,5,B004EPYZP8,This was the 2nd time seeing this movie.  We love it.  Matthew McConaughey was great. It was suspensful and we were on the edge our seats. Trace Atkins was also great.  Good to see him again,1373500800,,190,4.222222222222222
4354098,5,B004EPYZP8,"I remember when the movie came out in theaters, I ignored it. I thought it was some boring drama about a do-gooder lawyer, or even maybe a late 19th century period piece. Boy was I wrong! This is a legal thriller in the league of Gresham.",1373500800,,238,4.195652173913044
4354099,5,B004EPYZP8,"I don't usually enjoy this genre of movie, but once I started watching it, I was spell bound.  It keeps your interest, Matthew McConaughey did a great acting job, and you'll be wowed by the surprise ending.",1373500800,,206,4.5675675675675675

4354102,5,B004EPYZP8,It was interesting to see how the unorthodox lawyer dealt with a tricky ethical conundrum.  What initially seemed to be a one dimensional main character turned out to have some depth.,1373414400,,183,4.903225806451613
4354103,4,B004EPYZP8,"I did not anticipate things to unfold as they did. However, I was pleased.  Matt and Marisa are great.  I don't care much for Ryan, but he got the job done.",1373414400,,156,4.0

4354247,4,B004EPYZP8,This is the first time I watch an instant streaming movie with my Prime membership.  Didnt know there were so many movies to watch with my membership.

4354249,4,B004EPYZP8,It took me a while before I had the time to watch the movie.  I love MM so it was a must see.  It felt like they were trying to work the same angle they did in a Time to Kill but it ran short of that caliber.  They put a slight twist and attempted the same level of suspense but fell short of the previous mark.  It was still good and I am glad I watched it.,1373328000,,358,3.551282051282051

4354253,5,B004EPYZP8,The movie follows the book closely.  Great plot and I didn't guess the ending for once which for me is always a bonus!,1373328000,,118,4.130434782608695
4354254,3,B004EPYZP8,Just when you think the movie is predictable a spin takes place and you don't know if or how it will resolve. held my attention,1373241600,,127,4.12

4354379,3,B004EPYZP8,Was a little disappointed but worth the watch at home.  Had high hopes for this one.  Good enough for a rainy day movie.,1373241600,,120,4.173913043478261
4354380,4,B004EPYZP8,I really liked the storyline. I will have to read the book to see if the movie did it justice. No overacting by anyone.,1373155200,,119,4.0

4354382,1,B004EPYZP8,"I think the heading says it all...Pedestrian and obvious plot, the film relies on closeups of MM instead of relying on his acting.. He cannot carry a film..at least in this case he didn't",1373155200,,187,4.529411764705882
4354383,4,B004EPYZP8,"Was a good movie , enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot.  Would watch again on a night I was looking for a movie to watch but not my all time favorite.",1373155200,,155,3.696969696969697
4354384,4,B004EPYZP8,Somewhat stilted but entertaining for late night.  Could have used a little more drama.  I will never review again if told how many words I must use.,1372982400,,149,4.481481481481482
4354585,2,B004EPYZP8,I like most of MM's movies but this one was a bore. I liked that I could watch the movie through my kindle by plugging it into my big screen using a hdmi cable though.,1372982400,,167,3.8

4354592,5,B004EPYZP8,"This movie really kept my attention.  You wanted to find out the twists and turns that were involved in the big case that Matthew McConaughey's character got asked to accept.  Trying to figure out whether his client was really guilty or not was also a hook that kept me watching.  While the love scenes with Marisa Tomeii help show the character's softer side, the more interesting part was the whole question about the case and what the client actually did.  If you like trying to puzzle together the truth and the judicial system, you should watch this movie!",1372723200,,561,4.6938775510204085

4354724,5,B004EPYZP8,"I was reluctant to watch initially because I wasn't sure how good it would be. My mother in law loved it, but she's a forgiving woman lol. I loved it! He is definitely badass and witty. Twists and turns Everywhere! Worth a watch!",1372636800,,229,4.348837209302325

4354727,4,B004EPYZP8,A good fantasy trial lawyer movie where he does the right thing for the right reasons. I was glad that it didn't try to portray meth dealers and other crooks as misunderstood. To bad Marisa Tomei did not have a bigger part.,1372636800,,223,4.333333333333333

4354731,3,B004EPYZP8,"Although the movie is entertaining and worth watching, Matthew McConaughey does not fit the novel's character. Mickie Haller is a robust, slightly gruff character who doesn't blink when it comes to crossing ethical lines.

Watch ""A Time To Kill"" I think it was his first serious movie and he is excellent. His girlie fluff movies are usually from a formula that has been done over and over. He needs to do more real acting jobs so his talent shows",1371945600,,330,4.15625

4355422,5,B004EPYZP8,"I fell in love with Matthew McConaughey in his first movie, A Time to Kill.  I feel like I discovered him and I watched him closely as he has grown and expanded his talent, but has refused to be typecast or limited in any way.  His popularity continues to grow and he moves in and out of roles with apparent ease.  Just put him on the screen and let him entertain me.",1371513600,,367,4.069444444444445

4355713,4,B004EPYZP8,Matthew McConaaughey delivered a solid performance with a very good supporting cast.  The dialogue was a bit rushed making it hard to catch the full impact of the dialogue.  It is definitely a movie you see when you just want to escape into moderate action with twists and turns in the story line.  Not appropriate for young preteens..  The storyline is more important than the action that this age group seems to want.  I was able to enjoy watching this movie through prime time streaming.,1371340800,,490,4.7176470588235295

As Haller and his investigative team dig deep they find their client might not be the lily white poor little rich boy they had been led to believe. The middle part of the story drags a bit but catches fire toward the end. The exciting legal protocols might just be the best Connelly has written. Even if you're an anti-lawyer person, Connelly does a masterful job of roping you in with Haller's enticing courtroom actions. The last half of this novel will keep you up long past your bedtime.

I'm not easy to please with this type of movie, but this one had enough twists and turns and unpredictability that kept me interested up until the end.  Matthew McConaughey was excellent, one of his best. I think we can assume that the dealings of the attorneys who work with some low lives was more realistic than we are used to seeing.  If not, the tricks this attorney used made the story more interesting.  Really liked this movie, and I'm usually more into relationship dramas.

However, this courtroom thriller plays well as a DVD for home entertainment and does a nice job of mirroring plot progress of the book. McConaughey fit my vision of Mickey Haller, and I'd like to see movie sequels for this Mickey Haller book series. (For those just getting started with Connelly books, Mickey is the half brother of the longer book series starring Detective Harry Bosch.)",1369785600,3,492,4.9397590361445785

4356919,4,B004EPYZP8,"Michael Connelly's 2005 novel, The Lincoln Lawyer, garnered critical and commercial success. The film adaptation stays loyal to the novel, and is very entertaining.

Matthew McConaughey portrays the main character Mickey Haller as a kind of lovable, bad boy. Haller is a lawyer who has made a career of representing criminals and outcasts. He runs his practice out of his old Lincoln, and drives around town looking for his next case. Early on in the film, we are introduced to his ex-wife, played by Marisa Tomei, with whom he has a young daughters. It is in these moments that we get to see the softer side of Haller.

The story really gets moving when Haller is called to represent Roulet, a high profile, Los Angeles playboy who is accused of murdering a prostitute. Despite a bad gut feeling, Haller knows that this case could be the high point of his career. With the help of his own investigator Frank Levin, played by a show-stealing William H. Macey, Haller soon finds a connection to a previous case that has haunted him for years.

Overall, the film is a great mix of action, intrigue and comedy. McConaughey's everyman persona really helps Haller to be relatable and an effective protagonist. Ryan Phillippe is surprisingly effective at staying in the grey area as Roulet. The real star of the movie is Macey, who's appearance is cut short way too soon. This movie effectively captures the essence of Connelly's novel while still adjusting to the new medium. While this adaptation is pretty black and white, it is still very entertaining.",1369699200,3,1550,4.841509433962264

However there is one big problem.  With the HD version the top part of the movie is always cut off.  So your character looks like a fifth of the actor's head is missing.  This was a big let-down for me.

I haven't tried the SD version so I can't say if that would have the same problem.  But all in all I would pick another HD movie instead.",1369008000,,500,3.881188118811881

It showed the real LA, not just the Bel Aire/Beverly Hills view we usually see on the screen (I have lived and worked in the LA area all my life).  Great shots: e.g. The County Jail, LA River, and Metro Link train, all in the final scene. There should be a sequel!",1368662400,,341,4.246153846153846

I managed to loose my place in the book a couple times -- not the book's fault -- but I did go searching through the whole thing to find my place and finish.

I expected a movie about a typical defense lawyer - Give me the money or I won't help you!  Instead, I got a super thriller about a man looking for an innocent client and not recognizing it when it is right in front of him.  And someone else who uses that blindness to his own advantage.  Great movie!",1368662400,,390,4.1466666666666665

Bad, because McConaughey's career has since reignited and it seems unlikely he will make a sequel.

That could have been a good story!",1368316800,2,358,4.523076923076923

4357642,4,B004EPYZP8,"Matthew does a phenomally good job as a L.A. ""Defense Lawyer"" in this suspense thriller.  Just the right amount of both sleaze and pinache to work the court system as well as a client who tries to outwit him.  Ryan Phillipe is a believeable ""Choir Boy"" type character with a dark soul.  The movie is very reminiscent of the 1996 Richard Gere movie ""Primal Fear"" in many was, however this is the much updated version.

I do NOT recommend for under 17, and certainly not under 13, due to the graphic, sexual violence that is shown in flashbacks of the crimes he is dealing with.  I didn't let my kids watch it, and you shouldn't let yours, unless they're already hopelessly jaded from watching the evening news.

Matthew McConaughey played an impressive, slick, street smart attorney who truly believed that everyone deserved legal representation. To him, the scariest thing to have was an innocent client because if the client went to jail he could not deal with the guilt. He preferred the guilty client because he could then justify his tactics and definitely not feel guilty if the client got time.

The Lincoln Lawyer was a nice little escape. I would not pay to see it in the movies, but I would pay to rent (thank goodness it's included with prime).",1367107200,,614,4.531531531531532

4358291,2,B004EPYZP8,After reading the book and reading some of the other Amazon reviews I decided to watch this movie.  I was very disappointed in the result.  The movie plot did not provide for charter development and was more of a cartoon or TV show version of the book.  The plot it self was a shallow as the characters.  All in all a waste of my time.  There are better dramas on FX to be watched then to spend time on this movie.,1366761600,,414,4.061728395061729

4358365,4,B004EPYZP8,"Certainly exceeded our expectations. McConaughey is at his best in this type of role, so it seems, although he seldom disappoints.  The final resolution is lacking any complexity, but that didn't diminish the overall experience.",1366761600,,228,5.514285714285714
4358366,5,B004EPYZP8,"A great job of portraying the character from the book.  Nicely done. I think they captured the style of what a slick attorney Haller is, yet how he fights for justice within the system.",1366675200,,185,4.4411764705882355
4358367,5,B004EPYZP8,"When I heard about this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was something predictable--and yet not quite. Matthew Mac Connohey is the lawyer, who has an office in his Lincoln Continental. His dealings are somewhat shady, but he does stay within the limits of the law. Most of his clientele are rough,but he knows his way around them. He has a good reputation for getting people off and his next case is a strange one. The man is seeking to go free, problem is, he is really guilty, but because of client lawyer confidentiality he cannot do much against it. There is a plot twist here, and not without some dark humor. You'll have to watch and see.",1366675200,,659,4.409836065573771

I already have a daddy/daughter date set up for my second viewing.  When my wife finishes school and finally has more time on her hands, I know I'll have another viewing.  I have the book ordered too, and I'm looking forward to its arrival and reading.  Usually the books are better than the movies, but this is an excellent movie.  You will be entertained, thrilled, surprised, and satisfied when the end finally rolls around.  If you like John Grisham's lawyer movies, you should enjoy this one.",1366156800,,673,4.605042016806722

4358645,4,B004EPYZP8,"I'm not overly fond of McConaughey as an actor, but I thought this movie seemed interesting enough to give it a chance. Overall I was happily surprised by it, the story of a high priced attorney who seems to not have any moral fiber, but finds his limits in his most recent case defending a man accused of assault. The dynamic with Marisa Tomei plays well into the story line, if a little over the top in their relationship. It is a solid drama, maybe not edge of your seat worthy, but above average overall and worth your two hours I would say.",1366156800,,545,4.300970873786408
4358646,5,B004EPYZP8,"This movie has an unexpected twist in the plot when MM represents a man who strongly claims he is innocent. I watched it on my computer using Amazon Prime free online videos.  If I paid to see it in the movie theatre, I would have probably given the movie 4 stars because it is hard to beat laying in my bad wrapped in a blanket with my pillow watching a movie in my most comfortable position.  Nevertheless, I think the actors and actresses (such as Marisa Tomei) did well in the movie and it had a very intriguing plot.  I am glad that they had a very beautiful age appropriate woman in the movie and didn't search for a female star in the nurseries of hollywood.  I had to stop it halfway through and I couldn't wait to come back and finish the movie the next night.",1366156800,,769,4.210884353741497

4360120,3,B004EPYZP8,This movie was decently entertaining - it reminded me of a typical John Grisham movie.  Matthew McConaughey played the same character he plays in many other movies.  It's a good 'don't want to think too hard movie'.,1364083200,,215,4.783783783783784

4360128,5,B004EPYZP8,For pure class The Lincoln Lawyer proves the merit of a committed writer and a production company willing to maintain the true feeling of the story. And it is fun. And it is fun to be surprised.,1364083200,,194,4.27027027027027
4360199,3,B004EPYZP8,"I wonder if McConaughey would have preferred Hollywood's bean counters to have backed off this film, that his effort to star would have given way to his ability to act? The film was a missed opportunity warped by the wolves in the box office.",1364083200,,242,4.5227272727272725

4360204,3,B004EPYZP8,"At first you say to yourself, ""what exactly is this movie about"" because too much is happening.  At the end, it feels compelled to tie all of those little pieces together.  However the ending just seemed weak.  For the middle portions, it gets very smart; but it fails to conclude with the same brains and finesse. With such a great cast, you have to blame sub-par directing.",1364083200,,375,4.567164179104478

4360309,4,B004EPYZP8,I'm always glad to see a movie where I can't guess the next thing that is going to happen. This movie was entertaining. There were enough things happening so I could enjoy 'watching' it instead of just waiting for the next expected event to occur. Storyline was believeable although unlikely. It's worth watching.,1364083200,,313,4.9245283018867925

4360442,2,B004EPYZP8,"Predictable, formulaic, cliche.  Disappointed that such a mediocre movie has such a great cast -- Matthew McGonaughey, William H. Macey, Marisa Tomei, Brian Cranston -- could not carry the weak and predictable dialogue.  Characters are shallow and two-dimensional.  Disclaimer: In all fairness, I stopped watching about 30 minutes before the end during the big courtroom scene.  I just wasn't confident that the conclusion of the movie would make up for the disappointing stoyline and dialogue up to that point.",1363651200,,511,5.430379746835443

4360445,4,B004EPYZP8,This was not a typical lawyer movie.  It was interestingly different. I did not get bored while watching this movie.,1363564800,,116,4.8
4360446,3,B004EPYZP8,"Movie was OK.  It was an easy watch for a cold Sunday afternoon.  I found that it was kinda predictable.  Not bad, not good but worth watching if you like this actor.",1363564800,,166,4.125
4360447,4,B004EPYZP8,"I enjoyed the plot twists and the way the characters developed.  Bad make up job, but overall entertaining.  There were some unanswered plot issues, but the acting made up for it.  Better than I expected.",1363564800,,204,4.771428571428571
4360448,5,B004EPYZP8,Very entertaining. The ending was a bit of a SUPRISE to me. I never saw it comming. McConuaughey played his roll to perfection!!!,1363564800,,129,4.6521739130434785
4360539,5,B004EPYZP8,Well-conceived story line for this murder mystery.  Matthew McC plays the part of a lawyer who is likeable and disgusting at the same time.,1363478400,,139,4.791666666666667
4360540,5,B004EPYZP8,Matthew McConaughey is back at it in a lawyer roll. The guy knows how to at a lawyer! This is a great storyline and fun to watch. Stream it for sure!,1363478400,,149,3.838709677419355

4360546,5,B004EPYZP8,Matthew Mc does one of his usual parts great parts as someone that doesn't follow a straight line. Here you have a lawyer with no office that does well cause his expenses. He goes to visit his clients. I guess that's a great idea having no office no staff only expenses the car and driver. The way this main part was written could only be played by a good actor and in this case  Matthew makes it work. Good movie!,1363478400,,414,4.175

4360568,4,B004EPYZP8,"Matthew McConaughey pulls this one well above its level.  The story's only so-so and the plot twists are formulaic, but the supporting cast is solid and Mr. McConaughey's performance makes it all worth while. And that's without even baring his pecs.

4360569,5,B004EPYZP8,"I love Matthew in this flick. Actually, I enjoy most of his flicks. He's got that extra something special that only a few actors have. He has the aire about him that he could actually pull off being a stree-savvy lawyer.",1363392000,,220,4.390243902439025
4360570,5,B004EPYZP8,Loved it!  This movie had me captivated all the way through.  McConaughey played this role well from the ball busting lawyer to a soft loving father!,1363392000,,149,4.6923076923076925

4360690,4,B004EPYZP8,This is a good movie!  Can't believe I missed it at the movies.  Matt D. always puts out a good performance.

Perry Mason he was not. Perry probably would have gotten 4 stars, only because he failed only in two cases in his whole carrier.

A fear came over me in watching the movie, which was ""wondering if LA lawyers were really that bad? If so it provide with one reason why so many are in prison today.

From a desperate, poor man going through the legal system who can only think about what his conviction would do to his mom to a numb, cynical man was nothing short of brilliant. Matthew McConaughey also gives a wonderful performance, adding a depth to his character that some of his other roles have not demanded.

For all that, I liked the movie better than Amazon's "" it's okay"" which is their 3-star rating. So I gave it four.

4361269,4,B004EPYZP8,"The Lincoln Lawyer is based on the best selling novel by Michael Connelly and he isn't the typical lawyer you've seen portrayed in every John Grisham/Law & Order wannabe. Matthew McConaughey is great as Mick Haller. This guy is unbelievably smart, charming, and refreshing. McConaughey takes the brains from a Time To Kill, throws in the swagger of Sahara, and adds in the stellar writing of Connelly, (who mixes old school wit and modern ideals), to create a character that is easily the best of his career. It honestly seems to me like the role was written for McConaughey, it is that good of a match. Ryan Phillippe plays Haller's client in the film and continues to blossom from the shy southern boy in White Squall to a guy who will one day be a major player in Hollywood. It's hard to review a film like this without spoilers, all I can tell you is this. The Lincoln Lawyer is one of the smartest movies I've seen in a long time.

The lawyer role seems to fit Matthew perfectly.  It's like he doesn't even have to try.  Thank goodness for us ladies that he decided to be an actor instead of a lawyer.  This has a great plot, and story line.  I bought this movie after watching it a few times on Netflix because I wanted to own it.  I love having it on my computer so I can pull it up whenever I want and wherever I go without having to tote around DVDs.  This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time, wondering who did what, who is lying, who is telling the truth, and what is going to happen next.  The music in the movie is pretty nice too.  It is different than what you would think but it is very fitting.  So sit back, relax and enjoy.  You are going to be very happy with this movie.

It's an extremely risky move to backstab your lawyer,
and count on a great defense, with no counter-
sabotage!

Everything else about this film is great, top to bottom...
but if you analyze the script, it's really too big
of a hole, and should have been altered.

Now to the movie itself, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.  If you enjoy courtroom movies, this is a must see. A great plot. Somewhat predictable at points (but at others you have no idea what to expect). You may be able to see a scene unfolding, but you may not understand how it's going to get from A to B. If you have prime, definitely a must watch, if not - rent it!",1359763200,,455,3.989010989010989

4361530,5,B004EPYZP8,"They did a lot of setups early on that explained away what seemed like implausible moments later in the movie so it worked. Then there was that little Deus Ex Machina moment, but it was so subtle we actually had to go back and watch that portion of the movie again to figure out what exactly happened. There were a couple small details we couldn't quite figure out but I won't go into them so as not to ruin the story. Bottom line was we were surprised by twists and turns and most of them naturally worked. Now, if they could have just gotten by with out the little Machina--though at least the main character acknowledge luck was involved.",1358553600,,641,4.394957983193278
4361531,4,B004EPYZP8,"A compelling film if you don't mind the usual courtroom thriller tropes--e.g., Why oh why does the defense attorney always have to be exes with the hotty prosecutor? {At least here, she's not the opposing counsel he's facing in the Big Upcoming Trial.} Despite some very unlikely situations, THE LINCOLN LAWYER's twists and turnabouts are better than average, and once this film really gets going, it keeps the attention without much difficulty.

There will be mixed reactions to McGonaughey's performance as Mr. Slick-and-Slimey, Ultra-Mercenary, Hard-Drinking, Wisecracking, Craftily Hackish Defense Counsel Mick Haller. He's about as stock a character as there can be, but then again, he acts just like many real-life trial lawyers actually DO act. I think this film reveals quite well the role that he's ingrained in himself--the lawyer as actor, etc, etc. Many of the supporting characters, particularly the cops, bikers, and bad guys, are effectively portrayed. William Macy (as Haller's P.I.) and Shea Whigham (as Corliss the jailhouse snitch) are especially in-character and add a nice dose of reality here.

In search of more specific things to say about THE LINCOLN LAWYER, I notice that the majority of the other reviewers here basically like it but don't have that many specific observations to make either. It's just a good thriller: That's all.",1358553600,,1358,5.282407407407407
4361532,5,B004EPYZP8,"This is a brilliant feel good feel cool film.  There are few movies I ever want to see twice, some I can't even sit through in entirety but this film is a keeper. I would definitely recommend it and I would definitely enjoy watching it another few times",1358467200,,253,4.270833333333333
4361533,4,B004EPYZP8,"The strength of this movie is its excellent pacing- it barrels along at a brisk, engaging pace, keeping the viewer interested in what might come next. The legal jargon strikes that sweet spot of being interesting and somewhat complex, without ever going into the mind-numbing realm of the incomprehensible.

Of equal significance is the outstanding performance of Matthew McConaughey. He pours on his charisma at full blast, and even though he's a defense lawyer who makes a living of representing the worst scum in the state of Texas, you can't help but like the guy (even before he begins to question the morals of his life choices).

As for the plot itself, it's decent- not ground breaking by any means, but this is a solid legal thriller. The mystery aspects are presented in a fairly interesting manner, though the characters' motives can be a bit implausible/nonsensical at times. The ""Lincoln Lawyer"" is ""comfort food"" for people who want to watch a movie that plays out like a John Grisham novel.",1358294400,,1005,4.905882352941177

4361579,5,B004EPYZP8,"Twists and turns set to some awesome music.  Let's face it, it's really hard not to love Matthew McConaughey.  He's easy on the eyes and ears so he's always easy to watch in a movie.  But sometimes, he's just damn compelling.  He can be so intense in some roles that you can't turn away and this is one of them.  He plays a slick street-smart lawyer who gets played.  Some parts of the film are predictable but the movie overall is so well done and acted that you've still got to like it.  I don't know why I keep being surprised by how just how good Matthew McConaughey is.  With this and A Time to Kill (also a favorite with me), I'm fairly convinced that Matthew McConaughey would have made for a dangerous trial lawyer.  He's so slick and smooth, but intense and good-looking -- seriously deadly combo.

Did I mention how much I loved the soundtrack? Also, why does Ryan Phillippe seem to play the same character over and over?",1357344000,,931,4.391812865497076

He is good at his job, really good! He gets called into a case to help get a young rich man off on the charges of assault and battery and he finds out that he and the young man have more in common than he believes and risks his very survival in taking the case....

This is an excellent film with a good plot that twists and turns and makes a good story that is well acted out.  I enjoyed this film so much that I just recently watched it again on the Amazon Instant Video system using my Prime account. I enjoyed watching the slick and fast thinking Haller trick other lawyers, his clients and even the judges to get the results he wanted.  It is a deep movie and I recommend it to you as one worth owning.  I like Matthew McConaughey as an actor and he and the entire cast did a good job playing their roles in this movie.

The only upside is that I watched the movie from beginning to end with less than five interruptions of various lengths.  Considering my first attempt to watch the movie failed completely after the first 15 minutes, I believe this go around was moderately successful. It seems that my Shockwave Player (adobe) plug in needed updating (I'm on a Mac). Once I did that, I got through the entire movie with only a few connection hiccups.

This movie, already based on a book, had a great story to start with and the actors did a good job of pushing the story along.

The story is very compelling, the characters are very savvy and not at all formuaic. Great performances by Marisa Tomei, Ryan Phillipe, and the great, great character actor William H. Macy.  Mathew McConnahey was solid as a lawyer who is a shark with an ethical streak. The story builds in tension and the bad guy is refreshingly original.

4361791,5,B004EPYZP8,"This was like watching a movie from the days before younger directors ransacked Hollywood with skills suitable for producing duplicate blockbusting cookie cutters with comic book characters, competitively magnified mayhem and predictable CGI gimmicks. I swear, I was watching this movie thinking it had to be made by a seasoned old timer with decades of experience in directing. But I figured anyone with that kind of skill was already dead and buried.  After the closing credits, I searched for Brad Furman to find out who he was and thankfully he's young enough to make many more movies and treat us to a long, distinguished career in film.

This movie was totally entertaining and suspenseful without falsely manipulating the audience with shiny monsters or close-up car crash andrenaline. Instead, the plot's twists unfolded naturally. You knew they were coming but he kept us in the present moment until they popped us in the jaw. On the set, but behind the scenes, the present and past eloped and their oddly quiet offspring became this film's best friend.  A fusion of rap and rhythm and blues were caught on yellowed Kodachrome without predictable nostalgia or sentimentality. The supporting cast of camera work, editing, acting and post production meshed seamlessly in unified support of the story. Matthew McCanaughey about-faced from his sometimes loveable dufus into a man again.  Increasingly beautiful Marissa Tomei softly sparkled as if native to her almost ordinary but notably fresh character dimensions.

For the time being, Brad Furman plans to stick with stories from his life in Philly, but I see him branching out into new territory he doesn't even think he's ready for, making himself into one of Hollywood's top director/producers. He's gritty now, but he'll move into a style he doesn't foresee, at least publicly.  He'll be crafting covertly hypnotic visual and psychological dreamscapes you won't notice you entered until the lights come up and you're unable to stand. He'll write, direct and/or produce movies that, despite their big budgets, will blow us away using only a table fan and an open window.

Brad Furman dons the finesse of a high-class hit man, instinctively savvy enough to never walk it on the street. But as he passes in the lobby we can't mistake a hint of ozone in the draft of expensive cologne following his deceptively casual stroll through the sliding glass panels that open to the kleig lit, sapphire carpet running its full length to the entryway of the Awards in progress.",1354492800,,2526,5.072289156626506

RATING: 3.5 out of 5.0

Based on the Michael Connelly novel, 'The Lincoln Lawyer' pulls you in right away with its intriguing title. Will it be about an attorney who's known for his honesty just like our legendary 16th President? Not quite. The Lincoln Lawyer is Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a slick and somewhat sleazy barrister who conducts most of his business inside his aging Lincoln Continental town car. But in a sense, the parallels between Haller and 'Honest Abe' are not completely off base. Like President Lincoln, Haller has an incredible command of the law. And more importantly, he's cultivated the right connections which enables him to call in favors at crucial moments, guaranteeing his success.

Haller is one of those characters that may be a little too cool to be believable. Nonetheless, film audiences will identify with Haller as a man who is never intimidated. Consider how he's not afraid to demand more money from his client, a member of a motorcycle gang who's now in trouble with the law. And when he meets up with the head of the gang to demand payment, he has no trouble asking for an additional $10,000. There's also humor to be found here, when Haller is granted a continuance from the Judge for his biker client, after advising the Court that he needs more time to question a new witness: a ""Mr. Green"" (Green of course being the additional funds owed to him by the biker gang).

The film's neo-noir narrative, conveys a heady verisimilitude of the California criminal justice system. For example, when Haller meets with a former drug addict client who's now been re-arrested (again for drugs), he advises her that she's going to have to do some jail time (as she's already been through pre-trial rehab). When the addict agrees to give up a confederate, Haller gets her back in pre-trial rehab (an event which later figures prominently in the plot).

We break into the second act when Haller is introduced by a bail bondsman to a new client, Louis Roulet, a young Blueblood from a rich, Beverly Hills family who turns out to be a psychopath and possible serial killer. Roulet (played menacingly well by Ryan Phillippe) has been charged with beating up a prostitute but claims he's been set up by her along with a sleazy associate. Haller soon establishes a link between a former client, Martinez, who was accused of murdering a prostitute, Donna Renteria, in the same way the current victim was assaulted (both had wounds on only one side of their face). When he visits Martinez at San Quentin and shows him a photograph of Roulet, Martinez won't even look at it, as he's bitter at Haller for not believing in his innocence at the time of trial and forcing him to accept a plea bargain which sent him up the river for at least fifteen years (I was not entirely convinced that Martinez wouldn't have entertained Haller's offer to at least listen to what he had to say, in an attempt to ""make things right"").

Haller conscripts an investigator who he works with, Frank Levin (William H. Macy), a former police officer who looks like an aging hippie, to see if there's a connection between Roulet and the earlier victim. Haller is murdered after leaving a cryptic message on Haller's voice mail, indicating he was on to something. Roulet breaks into Haller's home and admits that he's guilty of murdering Renteria but invokes attorney-client privilege to keep Haller quiet.

Roulet goes beyond the usual serial killer routine (murdering prostitutes), when he threatens to harm Haller's wife Maggie (played by an underutilized Marisa Tomei) and their daughter. While it may have been a stretch to believe that most serial killers such as Roulet would include his own attorney as one of his targets, the way in which Haller figures out how to undermine Roulet without losing the case, is quite ingenious.

Haller calls in Favor #1 from his drug addict client who he got into pre-trial rehab. She fills jail house snitch Corliss in on the fact that Renteria had a sexy snake tattoo on her body that only the killer would have known. The assistant DA puts Corliss on the stand, but Haller discredits him by citing a case in which Corliss's testimony resulted in an innocent man being convicted. Roulet's case is dismissed but he's detained for questioning due to Corliss's testimony about Renteria's special tattoo.

Haller enrages Roulet by implying that he was responsible for setting up Corliss's testimony. Once Roulet is temporarily detained, Haller figures that's enough time to get to Maggie's sister's house (where Maggie and the daughter are hiding) so he can intercept the now out of control Roulet and call in favor #2 from the biker gang honcho. The once calculating but now impulsive Roulet shows up at Maggie's right on schedule and the gang members end up beating him up in broad daylight. Not likely, but again entertaining.

When Haller figures out that Levin had discovered Roulet's parking ticket put him near the scene of Renteria's murder, along with Martinez's possible ID and Corliss's testimony about the spider tattoo, that may be enough to put Roulet away for good.

I wasn't very surprised by Roulet's mother admitting to killing Levin and also shooting Haller, as it was pretty obvious from the get go that the mother-son relationship wasn't very kosher.

'The Lincoln Lawyer' may be nothing more than an extended Law & Order episode, but it's still highly entertaining. I didn't buy all of it, especially the rather easy way in which Haller prevents the killer from doing harm to his family. I also wasn't entirely convinced that the DA really had enough evidence to convict Roulet at a second trial. Nonetheless, 'The Lincoln Lawyer', with its realistic atmosphere and excellent performances, proves to be a notch above many of films in wide release today.",1350000000,5,5860,4.866599799398195

4362003,5,B004EPYZP8,"Haven't read the other reviews.  (Spoiler coming.) This entertaining little story commits political correctness as only Hollywood can, making the bad guy as lily white as they can, and it turns out he's a real son of a bitch.

Tomei and McC---y were both good, though Tomei was nearly  a cameo, but not wasted either.  McC----y wasn't really ""noir"" enough to suit me, and this could probably be re-written in a darker style that would really work.  Nevertheless, I had a smile on my face at the end and didn't have that nagging ""how could I have wasted a perfectly good 90 minutes on -that-??"" feeling, because it was just good story telling.  Five stars, not for being world shaking, or brilliantly acted, but for being a nice little yarn.

There was a half-twist at the end that didn't quite surprise, much less live up to the twisted ending I thought I saw coming, and the movie never really explained it.  You just don't care when you've been entertained.  Hollywood, for that matter, can't really tell a story that ties the loose ends together any more, if they ever could.  We don't really mind that much, do we?  After all, it's pop fiction.  What do we expect?  We expect entertainment.  Nothing less, but little more.

4362072,5,B004EPYZP8,"Walking into `The Lincoln Lawyer', I was well aware that the film itself would have to work extra hard to earn my respect.  I don't really care much for courtroom dramas, and I find Matthew McConaughey to be a really dull presence on screen.  I know that everyone swoons over him and talks about his `Southern Charm', but I just don't buy it.  On top of that, I just don't find him to be a convincing actor.  I don't see layers in his work; I merely see a lazy approach to telling the same character over and over.  There has been a lot of talk of the sudden upswing in his career, starting with this particular film and moving right on into his string of successful turns this year.  Much has been made of his Oscar chances for `Magic Mike' and he's getting career best notices for the savage drama `Killer Joe'.  Needless to say, I didn't care much.  I have yet to see any of his films from this year and I wasn't really anticipating them much to tell you the truth.  When I hear the name Matthew McConaughey I don't expect much.

So, last night I settled in to catch up on my DVR recordings and I noticed that I had `The Lincoln Lawyer' on my DVR.  I didn't record it, must have been the wife, but I wasn't really in the mood to think and so I decided to give it a whirl, since I expected it to be `good' at best and hardly something I'd feel compelled to dissect.

I have to learn to stop judging every book by its cover.

As a film, `The Lincoln Lawyer' is riveting and kept me glued throughout.  I was stunned.  The plot twists are engaging, and while the obviousness of the `villain' is a little too on the nose from the start, it becomes an easily forgivable offence since they aren't really interested in keeping his innocence ambiguous for very long.  The progression of the plot is well done and expertly paced by director Brad Furman, who holds onto the tension efficiently.  The final courtroom scene is pulse-racing for sure, and basically exemplifies everything that a courtroom drama should be.  In fact, I loved the fact that I never knew what Mick's next move would be and why he was making it, but when it all fell into place it made perfect sense.

And that brings me to Mick, or should I say, Matthew McConaughey.  Why do I call this a case of Oscar snubbery?  I don't know if I'd personally nominate him, considering that last year was ridiculously strong, but a very solid case can be made for McConaughey being a snub because this role is every bit a perfect one to garner a star their first Oscar nomination.  What McConaughey does here is actually quite remarkable, and I don't say there merely because he took me by surprise or because I expected him to fail.  Any other actor in the role doing what he does would have garnered the same response from me.  I am not one to shy away from eating crow, and that is what I must do here.

Something that I have always accused Matthew of doing is giving us a surface performance, with no actual depth.  I understand that in the beginning of his career he tried the whole `soul searching drama' stuff, and he did do `A Time to Kill' and yet I didn't care much for what he did in that film and so it doesn't count for me.  I've never felt that he has ever gotten under the skin of the character much at all; until now.  As Mick Haller, McConaughey layers so much on this man it's ridiculous.  In fact, the more I think about it the more stunned I am by the scope of his performance.  Mick is suave and under control and possesses that `Southern Charm' and sheer confidence that makes him a firm presence in any room.  That is something that McConaughey should be able to handle in his sleep.  But it is the tiny layers of panic that ride through his face when no one is looking that took me by surprise.  Mick wasn't just a stone, and as this `case' took over his personal life and threatened him in the severest of ways, you saw those cracks.  McConaughey let us in to see the inner turmoil, but then batted an eyelash and firmed up his stance and delivered a `performance' for the rest of the room that read otherwise.  Mick is a showman, and McConaughey mastered that aspect of his persona with ease.  The way he plays his part in the courtroom or the way he betrays his own panic by laying a threat of confidence out on his `client' is compelling and 100% believable.  The anger that floods his motives is also stirring and he sells his biggest moments with such authenticity.  I appreciated that he never overacted here, and there was place for it.  Instead, he displayed an honest depiction of emotional outbursts that stayed true to the man he was portraying.

When all is said and done, Mick Haller may be human, but he is one cool cat.

So, I give this very high marks.  The film is intriguing and engrossing from start to finish.  It has the ability to veer into `television courtroom drama' territory, as do a lot of films in this genre, and yet it pulls back with a glossy treatment and a plot that thickens rather well.  It's more `CSI: Miami' than `Law & Order', but Matthew McConaughey delivers a star performance that puts David Caruso to shame.",1345766400,,5129,4.348054679284963

The biker guys  really gave him a beat down and there was several actors in movie that could have been deleted since they did not add any value. The Love interest Marsha Tomei  role could have been bigger. Overall the movie was Ok and it is the kind of movie you can watch more the once.  3stars and I wanted to give it 4 stars but as stated the plots were like you seen it before.,1345248000,,569,3.973684210526316

4362136,4,B004EPYZP8,"Based on a Michael Connelly bestselling novel, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" follows the story of Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey), the ""Lincoln Lawyer"" of the title, who defends a wealthy family's son Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), accused of beating up a prostitute Reggie Campo (Margarita Levieva). As the story unfolds, however, Mickey realizes - maybe too late - that the case is not what it at first appears to be.

Admittedly, the central mystery of the legal thriller is not as engaging as the character McConaughey plays, a criminal defense lawyer whose ""office"" is the backseat of a Lincoln continental. Clever and witty, Mickey is a capable lawyer, always knows what he is doing, and though he is not infallible (just like any of us), he knows what he should do, having his own code of ethics.

The script is overlong (sometimes it feels like watching a pilot episode for a TV series), but is populated with interesting characters played by the talented cast including Frances Fisher, Bob Gunton, John Leguizamo, William H. Macy, Michael Pea and Marisa Tomei. Josh Lucas also appears as a state prosecutor, who gives a nice contrast to McConaughey's character.

The courtroom drama in the film's second half will keep you interested with some surprises, though you know that this hardly happens in real life. Directed by Brad Furman (his second feature), the well-paced film is also notable for the effective use of on-location shots of Los Angeles. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a solid and entertaining legal thriller with memorable characters.",1343001600,,1545,5.074803149606299

Yet, as stated, this is a very good film because the acting is consistently very good, and Matthew McConaughey gives an even better performance than he usually gives.

4362325,4,B004EPYZP8,"First of all, I'll be upfront about this movie. I never got the title until I saw the extras. The extras explain that Matthew McConaghey's lawyer character works out of his Lincoln Continental car. Maybe I'm slow on the uptake but if the whole setup was this lawyer found it more convenient to work from his car, then I missed that. Even though there are lots of scenes of him going to and from court to wherever driven by his chauffeur, I just thought the open briefcase, the talking on the cell phone and the meeting up with the Hell's Angels clients on the road were all they were.

In another scene you see McConaghey going through old files in his garage so I just assumed he worked out of his home. Anyway, that's where I'm coming from.

The extras also pointed out by the book's author upon which the movie is based that the action occurs in this one justice area in Van Nuys, California, that houses various buildings such as a holding jail, courthouse and various bail bonds offices. In the movie I never figured that out as when they cut from scenes in each of these places you never really see McConaghey walk from one building to the next.

So in this sense despite a terrific movie that has great characters, tremendous twists and turns, great supporting cast (Marisa Tomei and John Leguizamo are among the ""names"") a very evil Ryan Philippe, I don't think the director who converted the book to screen if it took the extras (which are all pretty terrific) really was able to give us a sense that much of the courtroom and prisoner-lawyer scenes were all within virtually the same block.

The extras (and sorry to go on about them more than the actual movie but they really are terrific) also had the author Michael Connelly (a former LA Times crime reporter)take us on a drive around the LA of the Lincoln lawyer which was endlessly fascinating and very much Raymond Chandler-esque.",1328659200,,1896,4.567647058823529

There is no way he could represent client A, ethically, and should have withdrawn from the case. Plus, you cannot represent a client in a way that ultimately causes that client detriment.  And he breached the duty of confidentiality to do it by getting the information to the jailhouse snitch (and ruining the career of the prosecutor in the process).

One day he is presented with a client accused of rape.

It is violence an actual person would commit in similar circumstances rather than heroic movie violence. The characters experience personal growth but no grand epiphanies with soaring music. Yet the movie is engaging throughout. Truly a balance between drama and realism.

A crime thriller adapted from Michael Connelly's best selling novel of the same name, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a solid and entertaining film that is easy to follow.  It is rife with noteworthy performances and events that offer its main character a new outlook on himself and the law.

Mick Haller (McConnaughey) is a high-profile defense attorney in LA who is known for his good looks, devil-may-care persona and fetish for Lincoln towncars.  His ex-wife and fellow attorney Maggie (Tomei) is immune to the facade, decrying his sensibilities as a lawyer (""I'm trying like hell to keep scumbags off the street while you're busy putting them right back on it"") right along with local law enforcement (""Where does someone like you sleep at night?  With all the scum you represent?"").  Haller laughs it off but his good humor is stifled when he offers to defend Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) against a rape charge. When his client's self-proclaimed innocence doesn't mesh with the facts and things get sinister and dangerous, Haller ends up fighting for his life to render a verdict he doesn't believe in.

Though this movie was enjoyable, it takes one too many liberties for my liking.  First, when Roulet is on the stand, he directly addresses the jury to once again proclaim his innocence while giving them a sob story (this would never fly in a real courtroom).  Then, towards the film's end, Mick calls in a ""favor"" and exacts some justice of his own.  I just can't see him getting away with this one considering the circumstances: he represents the people who perform said ""favor"", his victim is able to place him at a specific location at a specific time, and there is property damage and assault involved.  Far-fetched, in my opinion, but I guess at this point the audience is only supposed to care about seeing a scumbag get what he deserves.  And let's not even mention the unlicensed firearm he uses to defend himself during a skirmish.

What viewers can fathom is Mick's dilemma in defending a man whose innocence is either questionable or false, and McConnaughey renders his character's tribulation splendidly.  Though I don't think it equals his performance in ""A Time To Kill"", it comes fairly close.  Phillippe is passable as the arrogant Roulet.  He doesn't come off as menacing as the character could be - all I saw was a Machiavellian pipsqueak but perhaps this is the interpretation the director wanted. It's a shame that Tomei is relegated to the background; I wanted to see more of her, especially since her character was an attorney.  Most everyone else ranges from good to serviceable.  The only error in casting I see here is William H. Macy - why give a man that talented such a short-lived role?  What a waste.

Though this kind of story has been done before in different ways and possesses a predictable outcome (most movies like this don't let the bad guys get away), ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is decent entertainment for someone who wants an exciting plot and a denouement that gives a sense of closure.",1323388800,3,3162,4.788213627992634

4362500,4,B004EPYZP8,"Sometimes, a pretty boy actor doesn't get interesting until he's developed a few more wrinkles on his face, gravitas on his mug, suggesting a life having lived. Of late, Matthew McConaughey has been dismissed by naysayers as a good-looking huckster, grinning that toothy grin, flexing those ripped abs. And he hasn't done himself any favors with his recent cinematic outings (GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST, really?). THE LINCOLN LAWYER, adapted from Michael Connelly's novel, should get his critics off his back some. It's a corker of a legal thriller, and McConaughey hasn't been this watchable in years.

McConaughey plays Mick Haller, Los Angeles's slickest criminal defense attorney, the sort of sleazy legal practitioner that Atticus Finch longs to take behind the woodshed. Mick, who works out of the back seat of his classic Lincoln Town Car, has sold out a long time ago. He doesn't give an ef if a guy is guilty or not as long as the money's good. He lists on his rolodex some of L.A.'s shadiest lowlifes. Although, this time out, he's landed a posh client (Ryan Phillippe) accused of assault and attempted murder, except that this uppercrust young gent claims his innocence. But they all say they're innocent, ain't that so? Mick Haller regards this as a slam-dunk case. The rest of us know better. Strap in for a rollercoaster ride of ruses, runarounds, and reversals.

It's a solid supporting cast. I am so glad Marisa Tomei got cast instead of some vapid model-type. Tomei is a real-looking woman and beautiful. She plays Mick Haller's fierce rival in court, a tough prosecutor as well as his ex-wife and the mother of his daughter. When the chips are down, she becomes Mick's most steadfast anchor. William H. Macy again makes lemonade out of lemon with his otherwise-would've-been-blah part of Mick's investigator. John Leguizamo does his usual squirrelly thing as a bail bondsman who tips off Mick to this plum case (but even that's a lie). In just a few short scenes Michael Pea provides one of the film's most sobering moments as he transitions from Mick's weepy panic-struck client to a hardened, dead-eyed convict. Josh Lucas, whom I always regarded as something of a McConaughey look-alike, goes up against McConaughey in court and he's pretty workmanlike, but not bad.

There's enough twisty material here to make you lean into the screen. As Mick unearths deception after deception, he begins to suspect that his rich client may well be guilty (but is he?). One knock against the plot is that it does seem a bit too contrived that one of Mick's old cases happens to tie into this new one. There's a nasty, low-down feel to this story, a scruffy edginess, and it grips you. McConaughey invests a measure of grit and slime into his performance, and I really enjoyed it. Check out his Mick Haller, sly as a serpent, fast-talking, deal-making, working all the angles, scruples gathering dust on the shelf. Except that there may be a twinge of righteousness still left in Mick Haller which might make him turn a corner. Or is that another red herring? THE LINCOLN LAWYER doesn't achieve the heights of THE VERDICT or A FEW GOOD MEN, but it does what it sets out to do. It is a ripping legal thriller and comes at you with attitude. It is hopefully the first in a film franchise. After all, Michael Connelly's written four novels starring our morally grey counselor. And McConaughey's got them wrinkles now. Take advantage of that, yo.",1320796800,3,3449,4.852292020373515
4362501,4,B004EPYZP8,"It's been a while since there has been a decent courtroom drama, but happily now that one has come along, it turns out to be worth the wait.  Matthew MaConaughy is the titular purveyor of legal expertise, which he does not from an office of leather topped desks and imposing shelves full of legal tomes, but rather from the back seat of his Lincoln.  It soon becomes clear that he is quite happy to represent anyone at all, indeed that this may even come from his conscience - his greatest fear being that he might have the responsibility of defending someone who is actually innocent.  It's an interesting and satisfyingly explored twist on the usual moral-high-ground style lawyers we usually see in these movies.  However his next case defending the rich Ryan Phillippe character, turns out to be challenging both to his sense of what he knows is right, and a challenge to his skills in out-manipulating.
All this leads to some satisfying courtroom scenes, and perhaps does not hold too many genuine surprises.  Except perhaps for the biggest surprise of the movie - a remarkable return to form for Maconaughy, after years in sub-par rom-coms, his first return to the courtroom since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Time-to-Kill-Blu-ray/dp/B0019NG7GI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Time to Kill [Blu-ray</a>] makes you wish he'd never left. He certainly holds the movie together, far outshining the lesser role given to Ryan Phillips.  Which is not to say his is the only good performance, surrounded by an assortment of top notch character actors (Marisa Tomei, John Leguizamo, William Macy and others) adding a real sense of reality and grittiness to the movie.
I liked it, and I recommend it.  It loses a star for a certain level of predictability and a less than charismatic performance from Ryan Phillippe, but still gets a solid 4 stars on the basis of terrific characterization and interesting spin on the courtroom drama formula.",1320537600,,1983,5.236593059936909

Good early reveal, which I won't ruin, but it keeps you wondering how McConaughey's slick but likable lawyer is going to figure his way out. McConaughey is a defense attorney who has grown too used to defending ""innocent"" men when he stumbles upon a case that seems to reveal that he may have let an innocent man go to jail for a crime he didn't commit.  Not sure how this did in the theaters but it is really a good flick with satisfying payoff.",1320278400,,608,4.611111111111111

4362576,3,B004EPYZP8,"I wish I could give this 3.5 stars...I feel three stars is a little bit low, as it was enjoyable and I will probably watch it again (I bought it before viewing).  However, I don't think it really warrants 4 stars.  As a fledgling attorney, I wasn't all that happy with the way the justice system is portrayed here (particularly the star attorney).  I know he is meant to be a ""hero"" as he is lashing out at the bad guy and helping to free the innocent man, but I had a hard time liking him because of his methods.  NOTE: I know this is probably a minority viewpoint, so if you don't think this will bother you, I would recommend it as a good watch.

As as I said to my husband after the first 45 minutes or so ""oh so many ethical violations""; whether he thinks he is doing the right thing or not, the main character commits numerous ethical violations at the beginning, and again at the end after he realizes what is really going on - I am tempted to play a game and see how many I can spot the next time I watch it. While this is not a bar to enjoying the movie (as I said I did enjoy the plot), I found it hard to like the main character because of it, and as an attorney I didn't appreciate the portrayal, particularly - and I find myself hoping there are very few attorneys like him.

Furthermore, the story would have (in my opinion) been even more interesting if it had delved into how the legal system ACTUALLY handles such situations; it has happened in real life, and there are cases out there that the author could have utilized.  ""Truth is stranger than fiction"", and has the benefit of being truth.  While I don't think inaccuracy or ""fluffing"" of a character necessarily detracts from a movie or book, I think it did so here, at least for me.  The story could have been done equally well (probably better) without such a sleazy main character.",1319760000,9,1856,4.264957264957265

Mickey (McConaughey) eventually does and the courtroom fun begins.  And I do like courtroom drama.  In spite of the twists and turns, the movie really doesn't break new ground.  Well except for the co-star, a 1988 (I think) Lincoln Towncar that Mickey uses as his office.  This is the most prominent use of a Lincoln since ""Entourage"".

There were a few bright spots of acting when Matthew McConaughey's character cries over not being able to recognize the innocent from the guilty or when he's figuring out he may have put an innocent man in jail, but other than that his acting was not so great.  The highlights came from (in order) the guy who played the prostitute's ""john"" and the rehabbed ex-con who both took the stand in this courtroom/crime drama.  Their performances had me in stitches -- they were really good.  Ryan Phillipe wasn't too bad.  He made a reasonably believable sociopath.  The dialog was pretty thin... not the worst I've seen, but still.  The plot was a bit choppy too... didn't seem to flow right (IMHO) - lol.

4362714,5,B004EPYZP8,"Remember the last good movie Matthew McConaughey was in?  You have to reach back a way, but it was Time to Kill, where he played a lawyer whose life gets turned upside down after taking a high profile case in which there are questions of the defendant's actual guilt.  It should come as no surprise then, that his role as Mick Haller - a slick-talking, deal-cutting, lowlife-defending criminal defense lawyer whose life gets turned upside down after taking a nearly identical case (at least outwardly) - produces a crisp, if somewhat unoriginal, movie high on intense legal thrills and unsolved mysteries.  The primary dissimilarity is rather than superb oratory skills used on a sympathetic jury, Haller uses the flaws and loopholes in the legal system to his advantage in an effort to correct wrongs as he sees them.  This does not gain him favor with the prosecuting attorneys who view Haller as bottom-feeding scum.  Secondary to lawyer differences is the client.  Instead of a poor black man it's a rich white man (Ryan Phillipe as Louis Roulet, perfect casting for the entitled WASP).  The two movies are so similar McConaughey even has a hot wife in this one (Marisa Tomei); although, she's not as hot as her film predecessor (Ashley Judd).  Speaking of Judd, this movie is believable, unlike the legal dramas she's been in.  Which is probably why it's so engrossing.

When a man (Roulet) accused of beating a hooker (Hooker), a sleazy bail-bondsman (Leguizamo) gets Haller and his P.I. (Macy) the case.  Once the details begin to get exposed, mystery and truth is revealed.  As the shady deals, criminal informants, and plot twists unravel, The Lincoln Lawyer displays how a superb mystery can be crafted without a ton of extraneous fluff thrown in for no other reason than masturbatory screen-writing.

An all around fine film that has very little room for improvement.  Highly recommended.",1315958400,,1899,4.968354430379747

There are a few obvious flaws in the plot, a great entertainment nevertheless. Highly recommended!",1315872000,,424,4.985915492957746
4362717,2,B004EPYZP8,"This movie starts out showing us that Mcconaughey plays a smooth, tough as nails, street wise defense attorney who is as good as it gets in criminal cases.  Then it rolls into a pretty good story with a high profile case.  Don't be seduced by the flashy trailer and synopses, this movie is no such thing.  It's a very, very bad thriller that hinges on an implausible and faulty notion of the meaning of attorney client privilege.

Shall I explain?  Attorney client privilege only applies to what the client says about the case!  If a client confesses a crime or says he's going to commit one, that is not privileged, in fact it's your ethical duty as an attorney to notify the police if you believe your client is going to commit a crime, has committed one, or is going to otherwise harm himself, and no, you do not get disbarred for doing so.  It's the same thing you do as a psychiatric counselor, and no, your headshrinker wouldn't lose his license either!  The conflict of this ""thriller"" is that Mcconaughey's client confesses to a past crime in which a former client of Mcconaughey's is in prison for, confesses to breaking in to Mcconaughey's home, to threatening harm on Mcconaughey's family, and to having Mcconaughey's partner killed, and rather than hold its screenwriters to accurate representations of what attorneys do, they tell us that Mcconaughey's going to lose his license if he brings any of this to the police which is indeed his duty to do so.  Huh?  Did the writers actually ask an attorney what attorney client privilege means?  I guess not.

At this point of the film, it just turns to trash and I'm told the novel is the same.  Excuse me for being so critical, but I'm sure you're the same way.  You want your sports movies to accurately represent the sport your watching.  You want racing movies to accurately use car talk.  You want medical movies to plausibly show what doctors do, but why can't we have such high profile crime thrillers like this accurately show an attorney?

Mcconaughey is over all the smooth, brazen, and cool Mcconaughey we like watching, rather than the watered down one he usually is in his Rom Coms, but all that is wasted on bad writing.",1315612800,6,2192,4.637305699481865

His bondsman has just snagged him another case: Louis Roulet, accused of sexual assault and attempted murder.  Roulet professes innocence, and Haller, for once, believes him.  But the case is deeper and murkier than it appears on the surface, and Haller is about to be confronted with something even worse than an innocent client: true evil.

Brad Furman's THE LINCOLN LAWYER hews fairly close to the Michael Connolly source novel for the first two-thirds, which presents some good things (suspense, an interesting lead character) and bad things (major plot holes and contrivances).  Matthew McConaughey is perfect for the role of Haller (apparently, Connolly himself wanted McConaughey for the role); he never truly sinks his teeth in, but he's sufficiently charming, troubled, and devious to keep you entertained.  The film features a great deal of talented actors (Bryan Cranston, John Leguizamo, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Shea Whigham, and Michael Pena) who never truly get their chance to shine, and other mediocre actors (Josh Lucas, Ryan Phillippe, even Trace Adkins for God's sake) who get stuck with two-dimensional characters.

In it's final act, though, THE LINCOLN LAWYER diverges from the novel, and this presents a major problem: the moral ambiguity Connolly built up so effectively is utterly lost.  This doesn't completely ruin the movie--note the three stars--but it puts a damper on things.  Still, fans of the genre won't care.  If you want a slick thriller, with a touch of suspense, a charming lead, and a bit of intrigue, THE LINCOLN LAWYER is right up your (well-lit) alley.",1315526400,,1687,5.169117647058823

Ryan Phillipe is his rich playboy client, who initially proclaims his innocence, but of course doubt prevails. Marisa Tomei co-stars as McConaughey's ex-wife who is also a prosecutor, and William Macy as his investigator.

The main problem with the movie for me was the writing, particularly the dialogues. Most of the conversations feel very artificial, and rushed - the story is at pains to fit in all the twists I think, and so each scene revolves around the information it is meant to convey, as opposed to being driven by character or realism. In that it felt a bit like an extended Law and Order episode, rather than a high- level feature film. The characters felt thin for the same reason, particularly the Marisa Tomei and William Macy characters - both fine actors who are completely under/mis- used here. Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Phillipe both felt a bit wooden to me, even when they were angry, also probably partly due to the writing.

So story is OK, writing and acting so-so, just a 3-star film for me.",1315094400,,1310,4.766519823788546

4362856,4,B004EPYZP8,"Matthew McConaughey proves he's not just a pretty face in The Lincoln Lawyer. It's difficult to translate books to the silver screen, and this is no exception. Based upon the novel by John Connelly, the movie lacks the heart that enlivened the written version. It does do justice, however, to the character of Mickey Haller, a smart, fast-talking defense attorney who knows all the tricks and doesn't hesitate to play them. Kind of a conman with a conscience, if you can picture that. I wondered about the choice of Mcconaughey to play Mick, but I'm happy to report that he captured the Haller essence. His client, a rich boy accused of assaulting a working girl, will pay very well indeed if exonerated, but Mick senses there's more to these accusations than meets the eye. A mature Marisa Tomei portrays Mickey's ex, and while she handles well the material she's given, the nature of their relationship (still loving each other) does not come through. William H. Macy shines as Haller's investigator, as does Laurence Mason, the chauffeur with a keen mind. Michael Pena, a now-incarcerated former client (you can't win 'em all) makes the most of the few key scenes in which he appears, forwarding the momentum of the plot.  But this is McConaughey's show, and if his performance here is anything to go by, his career should be taking off from here on out.

I don't really care about the premise of the film.. The bottom line is it was boring.  The movie was about as well written as a crime drama you'd see on Fox.  It was entertaining enough to sit through once, but I'll never watch it again and the ""surprise ending"" wasn't all that surprising.

4362859,5,B004EPYZP8,"Matthew McConaughey plays a slick L.A. criminal defense attorney in the movie adaptation of Michael Connelly's legal thriller ""The Lincoln Lawyer"". Many of Sexy Mcconaughey's fans may remember him as a Mississippi lawyer 15 years ago in the movie adaptation of John Grisham's legal thriller ""A Time to Kill"". Those fans will be pleased to know that the guy still looks great arguing in a courtroom!!! This time, Sexy McConaughey is Mick Haller, who's familiar to fans of Connelly's best-selling detective novels as the half brother of the LAPD's Harry Bosch. Haller's an unorthodox smoothie: His ""Legal Office"" is the backseat of his chauffeured Lincoln Continental(hence the movie title ""The Lincoln Lawyer"").  Sexy McConaughey's newest client, is Louis Roulet(played by Ryan Phillippe).  Louis Roulet is the son of a rich family, and he's been charged with attempted rape and murder. He swears innocence, but he may or may not be guilty...  And his case bumps up against that of another former Haller client already wrongly convicted.  When Sexy McConaughey uncovers a deep, dark secret of his client Louis Roulet(Ryan Phillippe)the whole thing gets Haller's morals whirling in a way that makes you hugely admire him.  In the end, I will say justice is truly served to Ryan Phillipe's character Louis Roulet as it is deserved!!!  To some this may strike a sensitive nerve...  In my opinion: This movie is by far one of Matthew McConaughey's best, alongside John Grisham's ""A Time To Kill""!!!

4362861,3,B004EPYZP8,"Ryan Philippe has a habit of playing opposite more charismatic male stars,here against Mathew McConaughey,in Breach it was as understudy to a mole(Chris Cooper) in the FBI.In both films he ostensibly tries to outsmart andmanipulate more experienced men. For Mick Haller (McConaughey),a Los Angeles criminal defence lawyer,who operates out of the back of his Lincoln Towncar,having spent his life defending petty gutter-variety criminals,unexpectedly lands the chance of a lifetime,defending a rich kid realtor,who is accused of attempted rape and murder. Part of the conflict in this film is that Mick, being bound by attorney-client confidentiality rules, can't go to the police or the DA. Roulet(Philippe) broke into his house, threatened his family, stole his gun (of course, that isn't proven, but circumstantial is strong), and his friend/investigator is murdered and he is being framed for it... and still, Mick has no options other than to keep quiet? The whole point of the film is the way Haller dealt with the problem. He outplayed Roulet. It wasn't very realistic but it was entertaining! You also have the fact that his current case was connected to another one of his client's cases. Not sure how that would complicate things but he also has a responsibility to that client. His current client actually confessed to a murder involving that client:the sight of Michael Pe&ntilde;a, as one of Mick's old clients,going from freaked-out innocent to stone-cold lifer in a few short scenes.

Ms. Tomei plays a character and not just the love interest. She isn't the star, of course, but without her and the other exceptionally well-cast supporting players, Mr. McConaughey would have a tougher time making you believe that he was to the sleaze born. After his breakthrough in A Time To Kill, either he or his management team fell into the familiar Hollywood trap of following the money rather than following the talent. Here, he infuses life into a wonderfully seedy character, a lived in quality. Mick's confidence about his place in the social food chain is upended by a building sense of doubt and guilt, culminating in telling moment when he says, ""There's no client as scary as an innocent man."". Mick's descent into self-questioning limbo ends up tainting the lives of his straggly haired investigator (William H. Macy) and his district attorney ex-wife (Marisa Tomei), the few fledgling branches making up his hollow family tree. and Furman can't help but drench the film in unnecessary lens flares, split screens, and jump cuts. All the twists and turns add up to little more than an anti-climactic showdown and a simplistic moral awakening,with the cheasy ending of sucking it to a repeat client next time.",1313452800,,2722,5.144469525959368
4362862,5,B004EPYZP8,Movie was very well done. Acting was great and plot and themes held you in suspense throughout. Was sorry when I missed this when it first came out. Would definitely recommend.,1313366400,,176,4.709677419354839
4362963,3,B004EPYZP8,"Have you ever watched a movie thinking before hand it would be a good movie only to discover that it was just so so once it finished? A movie that just leaves you feeling a bit bland, as if had you not watched it you wouldn't notice it but that you thought was entertaining enough anyway? Such is the case with THE LINCOLN LAWYER.

Based on the best seller by Michael Connelly it tells the tale of slick lawyer Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a stereotypical lawyer who will do most anything to get his client off be he guilty or not. Mick is also likely to take his client for as much as he can get while the getting is good. Not the most loveable character you'll find in a movie.

Things get odd when Mick takes on a case for bail bondsmen/friend named Val Valenzuela (John Leguizamo). He has a client in need of an attorney, a young and wealthy guy named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillipe) accused of attempting to rape and beat a young woman. Roulet claims innocence from the start and Mick is willing to take him at his word. Refusing money from his mother to differentiate the client from the witness base, Mick sets out to discover all he can about the case and all involved.

Using his best friend and investigator Frank Levin (William H. Macy), he sets out building an alibi for his client. But when he has Frank look into something different, Frank ends up dead and the most likely suspect in Mick's eye is Roulet. The problem is being his attorney Roulet is protected by the lawyer/client privilege. And when ties to a case that didn't set well with Mick years ago start to form, he begins to wonder just who this young man really is.

Along the way we meet an assortment of characters to round out the film. Marisa Tomei stars as Maggie McPherson, Mick's ex-wife who works in the D.A.'s office. There are several policemen who don't care for Mick's way of doing things, especially helping criminals evade justice headed by Bryan Cranston. And then there's Earl (Laurence Mason), Mick's chauffer, the man who drives the Lincoln town car that connects to the movie's title. Mick doesn't use an office you see, he spends most of his time in his car.

The mystery involved doesn't offer an incredibly difficult plot to follow nor puzzle to solve. Who did what to whom becomes pretty evident early on. The best part of the film deals with Mick's trying to find a way to not break the law by turning in his client and at the same time finding a way to get him convicted of the crime.

The performances here are for the most part pretty standard. There is no break out performance to be seen but everyone does a fine job. The cinematography is well done with a few hand held shots that aren't so obnoxious as to get in the way. The direction feels more by the book than anything. As I said, this movie offers a decent mystery but for the most part feels sort of bland. Still, when it comes to a rental its better than a number of movies out there and you just might enjoy it.",1313366400,13,2978,4.395644283121597

The rationale for picking Haller is too complicated to easily explain, as well as highly improbable. Regardless, Haller ends up as a suspect in the murder of his own investigator (actually done by his client's mother). To escape the trap, Haller engineers a complex double-cross that's even more complex and improbable.",1312761600,,618,5.252525252525253
4362972,4,B004EPYZP8,"Yes, I know, everybody, everybody including Richard III, I think, who uttered some variation of that idea in William Shakespeare's play of the same name, hates lawyers. Hates them until old justice time comes along and everyone, including this writer, hopes to high heaven that their lawyer is up to the task of representing them zealously, and in some desperate cases more than zealously. And that combination of sentiments, that hate/love thing, is what drives this film which according to my usually reliable sources follows the Michael Connelly novel pretty closely.

Needless to say, except for the thugs, pimps, dope dealers, hellish motorcycle angels, bail bondmen, public servant grifters and grafters and a bewitching lawyer ex-wife (played by Marissa Tormei) nobody, no viewer anyway, is suppose to like the Lincoln lawyer at the outset. (Named the Lincoln lawyer, by the way, not for his ethical resemblance to Father Abraham but because he rides around in a chauffeur-driven Lincoln.) His wheeling and dealing just this side of the law is what makes him the darling of that rogue's gallery of characters listed above (except, of course, the fetching ex-wife, and maybe her a little too) and the bane of the District Attorney's Office and the Los Angeles Police Department establishment.

That deft and ruthless maneuvering is what also draws him to the attention of a vicious killer of women, women of the night to use a quaint phrase, and a surefire way to commit the ""perfect murder"" and like so many before him said murderer thought he was scot-free as is the usual case once the Lincoln lawyer was on the case. But see, said Lincoln lawyer ""got religion"" along the way after he and those around him were slated to take the fall if that vicious killer (a mommy's boy to boot) got tripped up.

So you know damn well pretty early on that our trusty Lincoln lawyer is not taking the fall and, moreover, is going to see that an actual piece of real justice occurs in the process by the freeing a framed man who was sitting in stir through his negligence (and disbelief in innocence) by seeing that that vicious killer gets his jolt up at Q. Therefore you see we had it all wrong. There is some rough justice in the world. And one had better not kill off all those lawyers if there is going to be even that amount. The twists and turns getting there, although fairly well-worn by now in movie-dom, are what make this film one to see.",1312675200,,2443,4.730046948356808

The familiar LA background pulsates in new ways, achieving an almost surreal quality.  The supporting cast is superb:  Marisa Tomei as Mickey's ex is sultry but maternal too; William H. Macy shines as Mickey's friend and PI; Ryan Phillippe as the smarmy Louis Roulet; Michael Pena as the wrongly convicted murderer; John Leguizamo as the treacherous bail bondsman; Frances Fisher as Roulet's cool mama; Shea Wigham, the snitch; Bryan Cranston and Michaela Conlin's detectives and Josh Lucas' self-important prosecutor.

4363017,4,B004EPYZP8,"As you've no doubt worked out from the slew of 4 to 5 star reviews this film has received - Brad Furman's ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a superlative legal thriller very much in the vein of twisting John Grisham screen adaptations like ""The Client"" and ""A Time To Kill"".

Adapted from Michael Connelly's book, the brilliant screenplay is written by John Romano - and it gets its hooks into you early and doesn't let go. It also helps that the entire cast is top notch - Francis Fisher plays the ruthlessly determined mum (of the accused), Bob Gunton (of The Shawshank Redemption) plays the defendant's family lawyer and employee of mum - a man who is all too willing to bend a few rules for his rich clients. Marisa Tomei plays Matt's long-suffering ex-wife and a prosecution lawyer in her own rite, William H. Macy plays Frank - Matt's equally long-suffering private detective partner and best friend. Josh Lucas plays the earnest but nave prosecuting lawyer, Laurence Mason plays Earl - Matt's savvy chauffeur (he drives The Lincoln) while both John Leguizamo and Michael Pena are exceptional as Latino hustlers and hoods.

But the film belongs to the two principal leads - Ryan Phillippe brilliantly portraying the accused - a convincing weeper on the stand who may indeed be innocent - or may be a an artic-cold slasher monster who needs to be put down like a rabid dog and not just put away. Add to this a central performance from the all-too-often underrated Matthew McConaughey shining like a diamond throughout (a sleazy lawyer forced to face up to his questionable legal tactics and outcomes) - and the whole thing feels like a really well-made movie - because that's exactly what it is (dialogue above).

The BLU RAY print is immaculate throughout and accentuates the gritty sweatiness of so many scenes.

It's not all genius of course, but ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a hugely enjoyable watch - when such things seem to be in short supply these days.

Most of the actors mumbled there lines so much that we had to stop and go back and see if we could figure out what they were saying, and most of the time, we couldn't.  William Macy was a great support for McConaughey but once gone the film fell flat. With few exceptions, there was a consistent lack of emotional connection, even Marisa Tomei, whose always good seemed flat. The story might have been interesting in another, more accomplished, director's hands.  Too bad.  Much to do about nothing.",1312243200,,642,4.605263157894737
4363019,5,B004EPYZP8,"Excellent courtroom thriller with a gritty Los Angeles setting.  The movie was based on Michael Connelly's novel of the same name.  Several plot elements were different from the book most notably two major ones but overall it was true to the book.  The film makers can be forgiven for the changes in my opinion because so any of us love Connelly's books and devour them as soon as they come out.  They had to throw in some surprises for us readers.

I'm not a Matthew McConaughey fan maybe because I've seen him in too many vapid romance comedies with Goldie Hawn's mini me Kate Hudson and other actresses.  I also love Marisa Tomei but thought she seemed too old to play Mick Haller's ex-wife.  I take it all back.  McConaughey and Tomei were perfect as were the cast of older character actors who almost stole many scenes.  In William Macy's case he DID steal the scene(s).  Country singer Trace Adkins is a delight as the bad boy leader of the local Hell's Angel group.

However, what does set the movie apart from your average tv night is the stellar cast not only the lead but support from Marisa Tomei as the ex Margaret McPherson and William H.

This may be M. McConaughey's finest acting performance but he operates in a pretty narrow range.  He is great at playing charming sleazeballs, and he plays this one to the hilt.  Marisa Tomei is great at playing luminous but damaged women.  Ryan Philippe is the best of the angel-faced manipulators.  Nice to see Frances Fisher in a small but pivotal role - she is a great aristocratic beauty.  And William H. Macy can play anything, so his part was a particular delight for me.

4363127,5,B004EPYZP8,"In a nutshell, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" story is: A slick lawyer skilled at getting small time perps out of trouble lands a high paying gig and, possibly for the first time, a potentially innocent client; things get interesting when he must figure out which of his clients is guilty, and who - the guy already serving time, or the guy who is likely to serve time - really is the criminal, and how to keep or get the other one out of prison.

It's the sort of story with a lot of potential, and this film doesn't let down. Matthew McConaughey (the slick lawyer) is at ease in the role, and transitions from easy-going and slick to worried and revengeful when the time is right. The rest of the cast is likewise excellent in their roles. The story is clever and intriguing, and progresses at an ideal pace - not too fast to lose you, but not so slow that you're bored.

5/5 stars, for a fun, interesting legal thriller",1311379200,,912,4.358823529411764
4363128,4,B004EPYZP8,"To me what made this stand out was the story, written by someone who knew or had heard of the ins and outs and tricks of the so-called justice system. This isn't the first movie in which Matthew plays a lawyer, and there's something about him that makes him especially fitting for the part. Ryan P. has filled out a bit since I last saw him in Crash, and he seems perfect for the pretty rich boy role he was cast into. *spoiler at asterisk

Still, the plot was the main feature here. It seems to tell us that when it's all about the money, there's a lot of dirty tricks that can be used to rig the game. I don't think all of this stuff can be made up, so perhaps we've been given a glimpse into the scandals inherent in the system.

*But, what was his motive to kill from the beginning? Who was trying to frame the lawyer and what was their personal motive in doing so? Why would Ryan implicate himself in a murder? He didn't appear to be the killing type; it seemed random. Was it because his mother was a hooker (or dealt her sex for good real estate deals), and he found out, couldn't hurt her, so he takes it out on other hookers?",1311206400,,1134,4.126696832579186

4363187,4,B004EPYZP8,"This film is about a criminal defense lawyer who practices out of his Lincoln Towncar.  The movie embraces many of the lawyer stereotypes and shows Attorney Mickey Haller (played by McConaughey) wheeling and dealing with his clients to make a buck.  For instance, in several scenes, Haller is shown strong-arming his criminal clients into paying by delaying a trial or making up excuses about the costs of expert witnesses.  Much of what was shown would be unethical and violate the rules of professional responsibility applicable to all attorneys.  But, it makes for good drama.

Without giving too much away, one underlying issue is the impact of the ""attorney-client privilege"" (a rule that forbids disclosure of confidential information about a client) as it relates to his representation of a present client while learning of information that could exonerate a former client.  Throughout the plot, the audience is given a few twists as Haller investigates the crime and learns what ""really"" happened.  In my opinion, most are predictable.  But, it is clever how they put it all together in this film.

One of the most interesting parts, in my view, is how Haller gets around attorney-client privilege and cleverly obtains justice in the end.  When you watch it, notice when the detective asks ""why did you subpoena me"" to come to the trial.  The reason is obvious if you think back to the detective's asking about the client who was in San Quentin and the implication that the detective was familiar with that case.

In the end, it is a great legal drama.",1310860800,3,1560,4.934865900383142

4363192,4,B004EPYZP8,"I'm not a huge Matthew McConaughey fan, but I did like him in ""A Time to Kill."" While I haven't read the original novel, my wife and I figured ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" might be a good midweek flick, and we were right.

McConaughey is Mickey Haller, a defense attorney who seems to do most of his business from the back of an old Lincoln. He's shrewd, wily, and fits right in with those he represents from the shadier side of the streets. As far as he's concerned, he doesn't ever have to feel bad if he loses a case because he knows all his clients are essentially guilty. It seems, though, that his father once warned him about the day he would represent an innocent client. Sure enough, his father's warning proves prescient when Haller ends up being retained by an ultra-wealthy L.A. client, a young man played by Ryan Philippe. This man has been accused of assaulting a hooker in the midst of a transaction, and indeed he was discovered with her blood on his hands, but he swears his innocence.

Haller takes the case. He makes a lot of money from it. But he also uncovers some small lies by his client. What is his client trying to protect? Does it have something to do with a rich mother who suffered abuse of her own? Soon Haller is getting pulled back into an old case and is questioning his own judgment, even while trying to make amends with his ex-wife and his young daughter.

It's pretty obvious early on that something is not right, but the manner in which this unfolds, both in the courtroom and on the streets, makes this a fast-paced and entertaining story. It has some lessons hidden in there about justice and the flaws in the legal system, particularly apropos after the Casey Anthony trial, but it never rises to greatness. There are some sloppy moments that may have worked better in book form. For example, I kept wondering how a Maserati managed to go unnoticed in slum areas, especially when the driver was supposed to be oh, so intelligent.

In the long run, Haller lives up to his own tarnished and questionable character by meting out justice on his own terms. He doesn't prove himself above the law, but he does show that he has a penchant for wanting the truth and wanting justice at all costs, if it means protecting the truly innocent. It leads to some interesting ethical discussions without ever taking itself too seriously in the process.",1310688000,2,2369,4.540983606557377

That was from the book. Unfortunately, the rest of the writing is like a juvenile living in mom's basement. Matthew McCanoughy is very good as the slick, unconventional attorney, but when you have him approaching a holding cell to talk to someone who's just been arrested surrounded by other prisoners you know the screenwriting is done by someone who's never been near a jail in his life. Similar embarrassing demonstrations of ignorance mar any drama that the courtroom scenes could have/should have had. Absurd give and take from the witness stand and complete lack of understanding concerning what a lawyer would have objected to mingle what is actually a pretty good plot twist.

4363235,5,B004EPYZP8,"The Movie
What we have here is a nice thriller about a lawyer named Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) taking a case that he will soon find out details and clues as to what he really has got himself involved in. Without giving anything away, the case he gets involved in is about a 32 year old male named Louis Roulet (played by Ryan Philippe) accused of beating up a prostitute. What Haller finds out throughout the case is clues about other cases he has took and all of this leads to frustration considering he finds out he is sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place (you will see why when you watch). The story does take time to evolve. Actually, things go quite slowly for the first 40 minutes or so and then things get going after that. There is a slow build up of suspense throughout, but for what its worth, the 2 hour run time does seem a bit longer considering how dragged out parts of the movie were. On the other hand, we have a good supporting cast around McConaughey including Ryan Philippe, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, and even our buddy Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad makes a couple of brief appearances. I thought all the characters did a very good job in this film, however, The Lincoln Lawyer was all too predictable for the most part which made it less enjoyable than I thought it was going to be. Perhaps the end of the movie picked up too quickly and a lot of things happened at once, but overall this movie deserves a 4 rating which in my book is pretty good, but not great.

Video Quality
Depth is very strong and black levels are deep. This is a very detailed and impressive presentation for the most part. The views outside had quite a bit of depth to them. Palm trees, pavement, scenery, you name it, had high amounts of detail. The presentation was also nice and filmic. There were some scenes with some very light banding if I had one nitpick. Otherwise the video quality is pretty awesome.

Audio Quality
This is not going to be your big budget action movie with explosions, but the DTS-HD MA track got the job done. It does contain a 7.1 mix so those of you with a 7.1 setup will surely be pleased. If you are renting the disc it looks like there is only a 5.1 mix which is really stupid if you ask. Lionsgate must have pressed different copies for the rental edition. Anyways, this is primarily a dialogue driven film and it is delivered very well. The surround speakers were used quite well too at times. You could pick up a lot of little things that were going on in and around the court room from time to time. Better yet was the hip hop tunes that would play and the scenes with the motorcycles. The sound stage came alive during these scenes.",1310601600,3,2690,4.356573705179283

Unfortunately it was so disjointed and poorly edited that it lacked continuity and flow. People and objects suddenly appear and disappear off camera with no reason. The flash backs seemed too flash-backy as if the director knew he had to fill some storyline holes. The rent-a-biker-group of stereotypic old codgers and the strange missing pistol prop and the off screen death of an investigator are a few examples of let's-just-stick'em into the story and see what happens mentality. The courtroom scenes also seemed very staged. The acting was too scripted and predictable as was the obvious things-aren't-what-they-seem plot twists. As far as writing it seemed as if the writer just tossed together bits and pieces of books and movies he had seen before and basically just rearranging the pieces.",1310601600,3,892,5.158620689655172

4363241,5,B004EPYZP8,"THE LINCOLN LAWYER is a classy, well-written (adapted from Michael Connelly's novel by John Romano), well-directed (Brad Furman) drama that benefits from the presence of a well chosen, first class cast. This is one of the stronger movies of the year, the kind of film that reminds us of the art of cinema.

Mike Haller (Matthew McConaughey in a brilliant performance) is a money hungry smarmy defense lawyer whose brilliant mind is bent toward representing sleazy types who pay well.  He works out of his Lincoln automobile driven by his trusted ally Earl (Laurence Mason), lives in a dumpy apartment, works with a shoddy appearing detective Frank (William H Macy), and spars with the beautiful fellow lawyer Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei) with whom he has a daughter and an on again off again relationship. One of his fellow workers Val Valenzuela (John Leguizamo) tips Mike on a case of  wealthy realtor Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of beating a prostitute: the case smells of lots of money so Mike of course takes it on - along with Louis, wealthy mother Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher) and the family lawyer Cecil Dobbs (Bob Gunton).  Mike's investigation turns up evidence that suggests his client is not the 'presumed innocent' he appears and there are connections between this case and an old case Mike handled - Jesus Martinez (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) - and Mike's usual 'go for the money' attitude takes a turn toward actually seeking justice in the courtroom. A shady dealing lawyer does actually have a conscience and finds a way to prove the truth will out.

There are many cameo roles worthy of mentioning - Josh Lucas plays the prosecuting attorney Ted Minton, Pell James is Mike's girl Friday Lorna, Margarita Levieva is the victim prostitute Reggie Campo, Trace Adkins plays the motorcycle gang head Eddie Vogel, and Shea Whigham inhabits the role of the jail snitch DJ Corliss.  But the major attraction here is Matthew McConaughey's Oscar worthy role: he is magnetic in his transformation from a lawyer you want to loathe to a victor you want to hail.  Marisa Tomei is once again given the opportunity to demonstrate just how fine an actress she is. This is a fast moving, well-scripted film that is simply one of the better moves to come out in a while.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, July 11",1310515200,3,2326,4.883248730964467

I would put this kind of in the same category as ""Primal Fear"" with Richard Gere and Ed Norton.

The cast is amazing giving Mathew McConaughey his best role since A Time To Kill as Mick Haller the slick, street smart resourceful Defense Attorney who develops a conscience on his journey through this film.
There are just enough twists and turns and nothing that's so absurd that you don't believe it.

4363266,4,B004EPYZP8,"Matthew McC does a very good job as the lead, the best since he played the religious leader in CONTACT. He is a defense attorney, more likely to be defending Hell's Angels than the hoi polloi.  All that changes though when he gets the scion of a Los Angeles real estate family.  This good looking defendant is played by Ryan Phillipe who is fast becoming a pro at playing creeps. He does a good job but I hope he gets another kind of role soon.

My problem with this film is with the women and specifically the mother of the defendant, played by Frances Fisher. Fisher does a fine job.  However, I read the book years ago and I seem to remember that the mother's role is a lot more complex than the way it is presented in the movie. In fact, the mother's role in the book is a doozy.  So I did not like losing that aspect.

I'm not sure how many more of these ex wife type of roles Marisa Tomei can play.  I think she may be reaching the end of the line with these roles and needs to start looking at more mature parts.

Essentially in this film we have a client, Phillipe, taking over the case by taking one step after another to back his attorney into a corner. Worse yet, the lawyer has a small daughter and has to worry about his client using his daughter's safety to control him.

If I had to choose between reading the book and watching the movie, it would be no contest.  I'd pick the book.  However, if you have no intention of reading the book, the movie is well worth watching and Matthew McC does an excellent job as the lead.

I have a difficult time putting my finger on why I feel that way, but it just seems we don't get a lot of movies like these out of the studios these days. There are no visual effects, no bombast, no 3D gimmicks. It's just an actor and a story cleverly told. Credit to McConaughey for bringing this guy to life. He really is electric here, further bolstering his impressive portfolio of attorney roles; he's got that way of being slick and in command and approachable without coming across as a douchebag--vital ingredients to pulling the Haller character off. And though we may be deprived of a neck-twisting Primal Fear-like twist, the thrills are still potent and the payoff is rewarding. Extras are headlined by three HD featurettes: an overall making-of documentary, a tour of LA with Michael Connelly, an interview with McConaughey conducted by Connelly, and a handful of deleted scenes.

The film doesn't hold back at any stage. A very good performance and it's good to see MM do a good job because he's not my favourite actor usually.

4363269,4,B004EPYZP8,"Matthew McConaughey is a talented actor who has spent the last ten years making forgettable romantic-comedies that stunt his ability to show his range. While The Lincoln Lawyer does not have him stepping into Oscar-worthy territory, it's a role that renews faith in his ability as an actor. Additionally, it's a solid film with a tremendous supporting cast and confident direction from relative newcomer Brad Furman (whose IMDB picture, with his Good Charlotte T-shirt and sideways hat, would not lead you to believe he was capable of making a coherent film).

McConaughey plays Mick Haller, a smooth-talking Los Angeles defense attorney who operates out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car, defending garden-variety criminals who can pay the right price. Mick is very good at his job and clearly fond of the luxuries it affords. When his driver, Earl, asks him if he can keep the job after Mick gets his license back, Mick replies ""I got my license back three months ago, Earl."" Out of the blue, a bail bondsman named Val (John Leguizamo) approaches Mick with an offer to defend a high-profile client; Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), the son of a wealthy real estate mogul, has been accused of brutally assaulting a prostitute. Louis vehemently professes his innocence and, although he is suspicious, Mick takes the job. Along with Frank Levin (William H. Macy), his investigator, Mick begins analyzing the evidence to build his case and finds discrepancies that only make his suspicions stronger...

The Lincoln Lawyer starts with a strong script, no doubt adapted from a strong book. I am not familiar with the author of the novel, Michael Connelly, but the last film adapted from one of his books was the 2002 Clint Eastwood thriller Blood Work, which was well-received. Two solid films out of two ain't bad; I think it's a safe bet that he's got talent. The script follows the formula of including a twist at every opportunity and this twisty plot keeps the film surprising and interesting. There are elements that require you to suspend your disbelief a bit (nothing too extraordinary, just too convenient) and it does get contrived at times, but it's much smarter and fun than the average Hollywood legal thriller. There are really two types of films here, the first hour being a mystery while the second being a legal thriller. I was a bit taken aback when they spill the beans only an hour in, but found the courtroom drama just as engrossing as what came before it. The mystery element is effectively intriguing, while the courtroom stuff is well-played, with intensity and snappy dialogue.

It's been a long time since McConaughey was in such fine form. This is a role with real bite and he reminds us that he's a movie star with genuine acting ability. Mick Haller is a suave, charismatic, arrogant, crafty, and manipulative character that McConaughey really sinks his teeth into. As an actor, he naturally exudes charisma and he takes to this character in the same natural way a Jazz musician takes to their instrument. Marissa Tomei as the L.A. prosecutor, and Mick's ex-wife, has a natural chemistry with McConaughey and a likeability and natural warmth that brightens up a film just by having her walk on-screen. Macy doesn't have much screen-time, but has the unique ability as an actor to bring a distinct quirkiness to his role and effectively steal all of his scenes. As the comic relief of sorts, he does just that here. The stunning supporting cast is not short on big names and big talent, consisting of Josh Lucas, Frances Fisher, Michael Pea, Bryan Cranston, and Trace Adkins (!?).

The Lincoln Lawyer is consistently entertaining and suspenseful while it moves at a brisk, clever pace. It has structural similarities to recent films (one that comes immediately to mind is 2007's Fracture), but what it lacks in freshness it makes up for in execution. This is not a film that tries to reinvent the wheel, but merely keep its audience entertained while they watch the wheel spin. It's well-acted and addictive. It's nice to see a film that that aspires only to entertain, but doesn't disregard intelligence completely in doing so. It's not a great film, but it's great entertainment.

not complicated and muddled like other movies.  The plot was well developed

on how the law should be applied and upon whom.  That way it was really
great.  The only flaw in the movie was when the criminal's mother is shown
also as a person willing to defend her son by doing criminal acts.  I thought
that was a bit far fetched that a rich upper class lady would be ready to get
into these kinds of activities herself.  That stretched the plot a bit too far.

4363272,5,B004EPYZP8,"Brad Furman's ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a slick, fast-moving, outstandingly entertaining legal thriller about a defense attorney burdened with the client from Hell. Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey)--known as ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" because his office is the back seat of his chauffeured Lincoln Town Car--is an arrogant hotshot who prides himself on being able to play the legal system like Jimi Hendrix played his guitar. After several plot twists and turns, however, Mickey suddenly finds the system playing him. He's even being framed to look like the perpetrator of capital crimes, and because of attorney-client privilege he faces disbarment--or worse--if he tells what he knows.

To say anything more about the plot of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" would be a capital crime in itself. Let's just say that the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat literally to the last minute, and that even the savviest thriller fan won't guess all the surprises Furman has in store. Matthew McConaughey hasn't been this good since he played another, very different lawyer in ""A Time to Kill,"" and he is matched by an impeccable supporting cast including Marisa Tomei as his prosecutor ex-wife, Ryan Philippe as a rich kid accused of rape, Frances Fisher as Philippe's imperious mother, William H. Macy as a scruffy P.I. and John Leguizamo as a sleazy bail bondsman. Airtight and engrossing, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is pretty much flawless for what it is.",1304812800,3,1434,5.102127659574468

4363316,3,B004EPYZP8,"This film is entertaining and well-acted, but in the end I give a mere 3 stars, because it is so unreal in certain important ways.

The Story:
Matthew McConaughey plays a street-wise, prison-wise lawyer (Mickey Haller) who works the system to make a living.  In some ways he's a sleazy guy, representing biker gangs, bribing clerks for info etc, but he's also got a kind heart for his daughter, his ex and his friend Frank (Bill Macy, a private investigator).  I think it's good role for McConaughey, and like a lot of other Hollywood ""pretty boys"" (e.g. Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio) his acting gets better as he ages and plays more serious parts.  If you'd ever gotten accused of a crime, his Mickey Haller character would be the guy you'd hire to battle the system!

Haller comes upon a case of a snobby rich young man (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of a nasty assault on a prostitute, and takes over the case from the family's clueless ""blue-blood"" lawyer.  Then the story gets intriguing, as you wonder if the rich kid is ""playing"" Haller.  Then you realize that he is, big time, especially when Macy gets killed, and Haller seems like he's in a deep hole that's impossible to get out of.  It's when he's in this impossible-seeming situation that McConaughey's acting skills come out.  Is he a cool lawyer with the whole world at his feet, or a lonely, angry, divorced drunk who is barely clinging on without losing it?  It's this time of desparation & suffering that gives the movie a little more depth than your typical formulaic film noir.

All Haller has to do is lose the case and the rich snob will be jailed for a long, long time.  But he's set on winning the case for his client and simultaneously getting his client booked for murder. How he does this is a little too slick for me to believe, but I admit it's good escapism.  Also, as many viewers say, the movie has well acted characters.

So WHAT'S WRONG with this movie (SPOILER ALERT BELOW!)?  It took me a while of contemplation to figure this out.  What's wrong with its message? Why doesn't it resonate with me?  It's because it is a total warping of reality.  This movie, while it PURPORTS to be realistic, is total BS reality-wise.  A sleazy defense lawyer who is amoral and works the system for money, is the hero?  A white, handsome, upper-class, Ferrari-driving real-estate salesman and his well-dressed successful Mother are evil Bad Guys, like the Joker and the Riddler?  Biker gangs are other heros who are on the side of the hero?  Of course, we HAVE TO BE PC.  SO ... can't have Blacks or Hispanics, who are 95% of the gang population in LA, be the criminals!  No!  The gang-looking latino who was put in jail for murder, was framed!  He even says ""My Mom is going to die when she knows I'm going to jail!""  He says it so well, you think you're going to cry!  Forget about all those other gangbangers who aren't innocent (like the guys who beat the Giants fan into a coma), this movie tells you that you just can't generalize!

So the movie (& I assume the book) depicts a flipped reality in which the population that is probably responsible for <1% of the violent crime in the US (rich, white, USC-educated real-estate selling golfers, AND their mothers) are the evil-doers.  And everyone else in the non-upper-class world: prostitutes, ex-hippies, minorities, bikers, sleaze-bags, are just fine ... i.e. they're GOOD PEOPLE.  Who we should really hate are those rich golfing bastards, not only because we're jealous of their money, and they're not taxed enough of course, but they are evil serial killers to boot and guarded by their homicidal 65 year-old Armani-clothed mothers.

In other words, what passes for a thriller on the surface is also very manipulative class warfare and PC propaganda.  But I guess it's worth a few bucks for some temporary escapism.",1303084800,11,3847,4.660237388724036
4363317,4,B004EPYZP8,"The film critics I've read have done an unusually good job discussing The Lincoln Lawyer, as I saw it.  I will just hit the main points about the movie, pro and con, that made an impression on me.  Overall, I thought the movie was well-acted, well-produced, and entertaining, even if limited by what might be called a good TV-caliber screenplay.

The movie drew me in at the very start when the Lincoln town car of the title and its driver turned out not to be the phony Hollywood glitz I had expected but a seedy image that fit the movie perfectly.  (One amateur review's complaint that the car somehow failed to serve its purpose simply because the title character drove around in other vehicles at various points is silly.)  The well-acted characters and unusually dingy L.A. settings generally felt authentic, as far as they went.  Matthew McConaughey fit naturally, smoothly, and effectively into the lead character of Mick Haller.  Haller is a slick, shady L.A. criminal defense lawyer who gets results for his low-life clients, even if things do not always turn out for the best.  Haller runs into serious problems, suffers blows from them, does not act always and mindlessly cocky (unlike the annoying, one-note young prosecutor-on-the-make in the movie Fracture), yet draws on enough strength, ingenuity, and resourcefulness that his confidence rarely fails him.  This made him fun to watch.  Sometimes, he stepped over the line, but not so far as to throw believability to the winds.  The story was basically interesting and tied up fairly neatly.  In fact, it is quite an accomplishment to make a mystery thriller that was generally this entertaining and satisfying without going completely over the top, the way so many of these kind of movies do (such as The Firm, Final Analysis, Just Cause, Guilty as Sin, General's Daughter, and the Ashley Judd films Double Jeopardy and High Crimes).  Lincoln Lawyer was refreshingly free of exploitative, sensational scenes used to gin up cheap shock value, horror, suspense, or titillation.

At the same time, I have to agree with the critics that the movie's story and characters do seem familiar.  Although workmanlike, including the courtroom scenes, well-handled by McConaughey, the movie lacked the sparks of imagination, originality, intricacy, and electricity that can sometimes come from films like this.  It did not really hit the high notes that make watching not just enjoyable but exciting.  The writing, while good, seemed more like a script for a high-quality TV show than theatrical film.  And some of the supporting characters, especially Haller's ex-wife and the bail bondsman, were badly under-developed and pasted on, wasting talented actors in nothing or contrived roles.  Haller's interactions with his ex-wife were not convincing.  Similarly unconvincing was the degree to which he felt a crisis of conscience about the way he represented a past client in light of newly discovered information from representing his current, rich-boy client, accused of trying to beat to death a woman he met at a bar.  Haller had more practical and selfish reasons for resolving the current case the way he did, without delving so deeply into soul-searching and noble motives, which seemed ill-suited to the rest of the movie.",1303084800,9,3284,5.112359550561798
4363318,4,B004EPYZP8,"This legal thriller is a refreshing break from all of the mindless, style-over-substance 3D fare Hollywood is churning out lately. It's a throwback to the days of classic courtroom dramas and police procedurals, with enough interesting twists and turns to keep eyeballs glued to the screen. Matthew McConaughey is superbly cast as the smooth operator lawyer. The rest of the casting is also exceptional, down to some of the bit parts like the bail bondsman, the jailhouse snitch, the biker, and the busted hooker. (I especially appreciated William H. Macy as the private investigator; I do wish that Marisa Tomei had a meatier role that allowed her to shine as she did in ""My Cousin Vinny."") Michael Connelly is one of the best current authors in the hard-boiled police procedural genre, and the adaptation stays pretty true to his spirit. As someone who works in the criminal justice system, I appreciated the realism. Money, connections, backroom wheeling and dealing, and simple twists of fate often trump justice. Just four stars because although it was solid and great fun to watch, it lacked a profound message or deep impact that would make it  memorable. You certainly won't regret watching it.

4363320,5,B004EPYZP8,"""The Lincoln Lawyer"" with more twists and turns than a corkscrew reminded me of those classic L.A. crime thrillers like ""Chinatown,"" and the hardboiled school of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and James M. Cain. Mickey Haller is a shrewd lawyer who manipulates the law, but can't stand it when he gets set-up and framed. In this one there are multiple set-ups. It is very cleverly woven together. The acting is serviceable and effective, but not superb. It is filmed very neatly with a fast pace that adds to the suspense. It is partly courtroom histrionics, but much of the action takes place outside the courtroom.
 Mickey is played by Matthew McConaughey, and he is well-cast for the part as is Ryan Phillippe, his client who is accused of an assault upon a woman. Mickey is a scammer who even scams the stuffy family attorney with a videotaping scheme.
 At the beginning everything happens at a breakneck speed, and it is difficult to hear the rapid conversation. It settles down, and we catch our breath. Phillippe plays spoiled and wealthy Louis Roulet who fervently pleads his innocence. Haller has been dealing with the lower echelons of the accused, and he needs a financial break. He's represented a member of a biker gang, a mob that shows up regularly in the movie and comes in handy. Other unsavory clients and cases have been Haller's stock and trade. He gets chauffered around in a Lincoln limo by a man who owes Mickey money for handling his drug case.
Get ready for layers of plot intrigue, ploys and mazes within mazes. Never try to scam a scammer, because he's probably going to catch on. I got pulled into this narrative, and the time flew by.
Author Michael Connelly has consistently turned out the best American crime novels of anyone out there. His detective Harry Bosch is legendary. Mickey Haller is a good addition to the Connelly cast. I can see a sequel on the horizon because there are several Haller books in my library.",1301875200,5,1955,4.747058823529412

As in ""Time To Kill"" and ""Two For The Money"". The smooth man pushed to the edge. Saying almost anything about the movie will give too much info away but I will admit that after being in the ""Movie Business"" for over 10 years I've seen enough that it's very hard for me to be surprised at a movies ending. The twist at the end of this one had me totally thrown and I love when that happens. I had high expectations for this and it surpassed them all. Watch this movie, you will not regret it. I loved it.

4363322,5,B004EPYZP8,"Agatha Christie would be proud of the five-twist ending to THE LINCOLN LAWYER. The film is clearly top-notch and street smart. It's the most efficient, solidly crafted courtroom thriller since PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. It has so many twists and turns that it's likely that the popular mystery writer would be giving it her approval.

It also reignites the career of Matthew McConaughey as an actor, not just a charismatic star. He manages to be smoothly appealing despite playing a corrupt lawyer who has no scruples in defending guilty clients as long as they provide the cash flow he demands. It's only after defending RYAN PHILLIPPE from a charge of murder and rape that he realizes he does have a few scruples left. And the plot twists provided by the screenwriter John Romano from the novel by Michael Connelly, are deftly handled for maximum shock effect. Brad Furman keeps the direction tight and forceful.

The cast surrounding McConaughey has been selected with care and all of them offer realistic performances. Marisa Tomei is appealing as his ex-wife who knows his shortcomings but is still attracted to him, and William H. Macy delivers a solid performance as his investigator friend. Ryan Phillippe is excellent as the client whose surface appearance belies the fact that he's as street smart as his sleazy lawyer, and FRANCES FISHER is outstanding in a small but pivotal role as the young man's protective mother.

Not since the days of PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION has there been a more intelligent script than this one, designed to baffle and blindside the viewer in the course of unraveling some startling surprises.
