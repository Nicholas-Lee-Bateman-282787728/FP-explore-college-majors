1077353,5,6305807760,"We can finally throw away our 8th generation Video Search copies... Don't Torture A Duckling is here! By far one of the most twisted giallos ever made, it is also one of Maestro Lucio Fulci's best films... truly a  masterpiece.

1077354,4,6305807760,"This 1972 giallo by Fulci may disappoint fans of his later gore films (although there is a bit of grue in this one as well), but it's a must for fans of euro-horror and giallos.  This widescreen 2.35:1 presentation on  DVD from Anchor Bay is a triumphant visual experience.  Fulci shows that  he can use the camera's eye as a canvas...filling each side of the image  with a character or action....if you've only seen this film in a pan and  scan bootleg, you're missing half the picture!  It's a joy to see it in  the correct aspect ratio -- it's stunning especially since it's 2.35.  The  film itself is fun as a standard giallo, albeit a bit more grim than usual,  and includes some nudity (Bouchet), gore, and another great wide-eyed  performance from Florinda Bolkan.  Young boys are being murdered in a  small village...who can the killer be?  And what the heck does Donald Duck  have to do with it all?  Watch it and find out!  The DVD is a very  basic package from AB --- the only extra is the Fulci bio-info that is on  some of the other Fulci discs.  So the movie is the key here -- and  although there is some graininess here and there --- you shouldn't be  disappointed.  Who would have ever thought someone would be releasing such  titles on DVD?

1077448,4,6305807760,"Dont Torture a Duckling,"" directed by Lucio Fulci, takes place in a rural area in southern Italy where a serial killer is targeting local teenage boys. The superstitious locals are quick to assign blame, the suspects including the local witch, mentally unbalanced Maciara (Florinda Bolkan), the village idiot (Vito Passeri), a voodoo practitioner (Georges Wilson), and a young priest (Marc Porel). With the bodies piling up and the community gripped by panic and a thirst for vengeance, two outsiders  city journalist Andrea Martelli (Tomas Milian) and spoiled rich girl Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet)  team up to crack the case of who is murdering young boys in the small village of Accendura.

The film is filled with red herrings as the police commissioner (Virgilio Gazzolo) heading the investigation and the cynical local police captain (Ugo Dalessia) keep getting the wrong suspect and the murders continue. Though there is less blood and gore than in typical Fulci movies, Dont Torture a Duckling incorporates a series of strange characters and sustains suspense, always keeping the murders in the forefront.

The movie was shocking at the time of its release for its brutal violence and themes of child murder and pedophilia. Today, its regarded as Fulcis masterpiece. In addition to being a dark murder mystery, it is a social commentary on mob mentality and vigilante justice, the arrogance of modern thinking, and the disrespect outsiders have for traditional values. It also provides an unflattering depiction of the Catholic Church.

Bonus features on the unrated 2-disc Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack include audio commentary by Tory Howarth, author of So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films; Hell Is Already In Us, a video essay by critic Kat Ellinger; Lucio Fulci Remembers, a 1988 audio interview with the films co-writer/director; interviews with actor Florinda Bolkan and key crew members; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork. The film is in Italian, with English subtitles. There is also an English language track.",1507075200,5,2078,5.303951367781155
1077449,4,6305807760,"The last 10 years or so have been very kind to the reputation of Lucio Fulci.  Once dismissed as an artless, exploitive, misogynistic gorehound, the release of most of his back catalog on home video has proven at least one thing:  he's certainly not artless.  And Don't Torture a Duckling (1972) is a rare bird indeed, both within Fulci's oeuvre and the giallo genre as a whole.

A killer is at large in a rural Italian village, stalking only young boys and leaving their lifeless - but unmolested - bodies for the authorities and press and discover. The suspects pile up quickly:  Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), an urban outsider and sexual tease....Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a wandering witch doctor...and Guiseppe, the village idiot always teased by the local kids.  Andrea (Tomas Milian) is a reporter who, in true giallo fashion, suspects the cops are missing vital clues and begins to search for the murder on his own.

Don't Torture a Duckling's pre-pubescent victims and a rather daring religious angle make for a much more serious thriller than the slick, urban nightmares of A Lizard in a Women's Skin, which Fulci shot just the year before.  Although the narrative is arranged in typical giallo fashion, the rural setting is fairly unique to the genre and gives the movie a drastically different vibe.  Ironically, it feels more authentically Italian, something most Italian films tried to avoid at all costs.

But that doesn't mean it's not without its exploitive appeal.  And Bouchet's opening nude scene, in which she flaunts her body in front of one of the neighborhood kids, is a doozy.  Like Sharon Stone's manipulative interrogation in Basic Instinct, Bouchet has complete control of the room...yet the context of the scene, seducing an underage boy, is something only the Italians would attempt.

Fulci makes a great case for any of his red herrings to be the murderer, investing some real character-building moments along the way.  And his approach to violence is - for the most part - surprisingly mature.  Case in point, a mid-film beating suffered by Maciara showcases all the glorious bloodletting the director would become famous for in the '80s, but sets it against an ironic pop song that changes - and intensifies - the meaning of the scene.  It's certainly one of Fulci's finest moments...but that doesn't stop him from laying down some unjustified splatter in the final reel just for good measure.

Arrow Video finally brings the film onto hi-def with a dual format Blu-ray / DVD set that looks wonderful and comes with its own set of extras, including a new commentary by Troy Howarth, video discussion with author Mikel J. Koven and video essay with Kat Ellinger, who focuses on Fulci's reputation for misogyny.  There is also a set of audio interview with Fulci himself along with new artwork on the collector's case.",1507075200,4,2848,4.96
1077450,3,6305807760,"In the small Italian town of Accendura a young boy goes missing. A ransom note is delivered and the police arrest a suspect, the town idiot who claims he is innocent. To make matters worse, the boys body is found strangled. With the public incited by this even they call out for the suspects blood. But then another boy goes missing.

The body count rises and the list of suspects remains as narrow as it did from the start. A promiscuous newcomer to the town is a suspect at one time but she has an alibi. Forming an alliance with a reporter the pair attempt to solve to murders before the police.

The police in the meantime continue to look for the more standard suspects. One is a recluse the townsfolk consider a magician. A woman who helps him is suspected as well, having had issues with the boys when they were alive.

The only tie that the boys shared was playing in the local churchyard. The priest their offers to aid the reporter and young woman sharing any and all information that he has. But as the film progresses the odds of finding out just who the murderer is remains to be seen.

The movie progresses slowly and can be a bit confusing at times. Much of the story does has the usual problem of losing something in translation. It wasn't until watching the extras that I learned the film was talking about the difference in lower and upper class areas, something that would be unknown to most. While I enjoyed the film I found it not among my favorite Fulci films or among my favorite giallo films. Still, it is an important part of film history and deserves the spectacular treatment that Arrow Video has given it.

Director Lucio Fulci had directed another giallo film the year before with A LIZARD IN A WOMANS SKIN but was more well-known for the gore soaked horror films he made. These included ZOMBIE, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE BEYOND and HOUSE BY THE CEMETARY. He was considered one of the premiere Italian directors during the 70s and 80s. But for some reason only those who consider themselves horror fans are acquainted with his name.

With the popularity of first VHS and now DVD thats changed. More and more of his movies have become available in recent years. Now Arrow is providing a fantastic looking edition of this film. I saw the film years ago on VHS from Anchor Bay. While the quality was better than a bootleg it still seemed fuzzy and faded. Thats not the case with this new edition. The film looks better than ever.

In addition to that Arrow has accompanied the feature with their usual bag of goodies when it comes to extras. Those include a new audio commentary track by Troy Howarth (the author of SO DEADLY, SO PERVERSE: 50 YEARS OF ITALIAN GIALLO FILMS), THE BLOOD OF INNOCENTS a new video discussion with Mikel J. Koven (author of LA DOLCE MORTE: VERNACULAR CINEMA AND THE ITALIAN GIALLO FILM), EVERY WOMAN THEIR OWN HELL  new video essay by critic Kat Ellinger, interviews with co-writer/director Lucio Fulci, actor Florinda Bolkan, cinematographer Sergio DOffizi, assistant editor Bruno Micheli and assistant makeup artist Maurizio Trani and a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.",1506988800,2,3164,4.667863554757631

I borrowed my friend's Blue Underground DVD.  After I watched it, I thought that the movie was actually good for a who done it story but you can figure out pretty quickly who the guilty is lol.  Kids in this village are being killed off by a killer or killers.  The movie has style and captures early 1970's Italy very well.  For the uncomfortable scene involving the female lead giving a young boy a free peek at her naked body, I don't think it was meant to be a sexual scene but more like a tease to adolescent curiosity.  Still kind of creepy.  Might of worked better if the boy was day dreaming of it happening to him.  The ending has a neat graphic death scene that you will be cheering for.  I will definitely pick this up for Arrow's Blu-ray release.",1500249600,,924,4.222857142857142

Swapping the stylish trappings of LIZARD for a more backward, old-world setting in a remote village in Italy, DUCKLINGs plot revolves around child murders and voodoo, a subject that would never be touched upon today as it is here, in the current era of political correctness. Whats even more shocking are the seduction scenes of prepubescent boys by a nude woman who is obviously enjoying toying with the lads curiosity. There is some dubbing that comes off rather strange (the boys sound like they were dubbed by a 40-year-old woman trying to emulate a 12-year-old male) and some of the acting is a little over-the-top, but if you like 70s exploitation and giallos, this is worth checking out.

1077496,5,6305807760,"A lot of depravity goes on in this quiet Italian village.  There's witchcraft, perverts of all kinds, sex, and violence.  Several boys are brutally murdered.  There are suspects aplenty starting with the village idiot/ peeping Tom.  Then there's a salacious slut who enjoys getting naked and tempting a young boy.  Also a suspect, the resident wicked witch who likes to dabble in the dark arts, which includes sticking pins into effigies then burying them once they've served their purpose.  As soon as a hardnosed reporter starts digging into these crimes, a couple of new suspects come to light.
The subject matter is decidedly taboo (killing children).  The overriding themes involve drug addiction, voyeurism, pedophilia, and the nature of predatory adults who prey on the innocent.  At times florid and overwrought, this spectacle is nonetheless an absorbing melodrama with a few subtle moments that one doesn't expect from Lucio Fulci.  I was mesmerized and sickened by this discourse on iniquity.  I do wish Fulci had spent more time though, delving into the mindset behind the murders rather than just concentrating on the villagers' reaction to them, which was entirely expected considering it involved their children.  The reason for the murders was a brief sentence tossed in at the end (it only explained a tiny part of the killer's rationale).

Slight complaint aside, Fulci artfully maneuvered through some tough terrain to deliver this powerful film.",1434326400,6,1465,5.240343347639485

1077563,3,6305807760,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such, cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

It's interesting to note where 'Don't Torture a Duckling' falls in Lucio Fulci's filmography - it was his twenty-fifth directorial effort out of the fifty-six he would go on to do, but it also comes before any of the titles with which I'm familiar.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie/dp/B005CU5OEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B0036R92US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of the Living Dead</a>, the western&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-of-the-Apocalypse/dp/B000PC6Z3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four of the Apocalypse</a>, as well as all of his other titles that I've heard of but haven't seen came after.  Since I didn't recognize any of the earlier films, I have to wonder if 'Don't Torture a Duckling', which I had heard of, is the film that marked a sort of turning point for him, but was still early enough in his career that he hadn't yet begun to rely on the use of the shock effects with which he would later be associated.

I think this is important to bring up, as Fulci's reputation as an excessively gory filmmaker may induce some to pick this film, hoping for the over-the-top style of 'Zombie'.  If so, prepare to be disappointed.  'Duckling' is very restrained in comparison to his sensational later efforts, although he manages to create a feeling of menace quite well without resorting to ripping off heads or popping out eyeballs.  In fact, he reins in the bloodshed until an unfortunate choice to go for broke at the end, which, for me, was so laughably bad that I had to drop a half star and rate this one at three-and-a-half rather than four.

Someone has been murdering the young boys of a small Italian town, and the police have plenty of suspects.  Tomas Milian, in another excellent role, is a newspaperman drawn to the story, and who watches as the investigating officers battle the people's fear and tradition while hunting for the killer.  Suspects are caught and then exonerated; some confess yet the killings go on; and all the while director Fulci crafts an intriguing story that comments on what he saw as the ignorance of many widely held beliefs.  I won't say that the revelation of the murderer came as a complete surprise, but there were enough red herrings to keep me wondering.  The biggest problem I had with the film, as I mentioned earlier, was the very end.  Instead of simply ending it, Fulci opts for an extended sequence detailing the murderer's just deserts, and the effects were so ridiculous that it destroyed any suspension of belief I'd maintained up to that point, and thrust me completely out of the story.

Still, for fans of the Italian thriller genre - or giallos - this is one of the better ones I've seen, excluding the a few scenes during the finale.  The acting, led by Milian, is reasonable and appropriate, rather than over-emotive, and the storyline is logical without any obvious holes.  Even the dubbing sounds legitimate.  Despite its drawbacks, 'Don't Torture a Duckling' is recommended for Fulci, Giallo and mystery fans - it's just a shame the director didn't edit out those last five or ten seconds.",1321056000,,3469,5.3474264705882355

It was very very slow, not very scary, not a good story, just plain stupid. This is one of those movies where I will no doubt never watch it again. I don't recommend it.

1077565,5,6305807760,"At the beginning of Duckling, you may be a bit disorientated. There are no dark shadows, no murder in the opening minutes, nothing looks undead or even a bit ripe. No, nothing but a beautiful sweeping shot of the Italian countryside; in the distance, a young boy sings in Italian. But as Lucio Fulci's name pops onto the screen, so does a 30-something woman, digging in soft wet earth with long beautiful fingers and what she's exhuming places us exactly where we are. The woman is tenderly digging up the deformed remains of an infant, almost certainly her own, and we are in the middle of one of the most disturbing giallo ever made.

The essential plot of Duckling is that someone is killing little boys in a very religious Sicilian town. Unlike an inferior horror film, this is a true mystery flick as well. The film is filled with rich characters and possibilities, and the tension that holds the town makes everyone fear the skeleton in their closet--and everyone has one.",1285200000,2,978,4.686046511627907

1077568,2,6305807760,"Warning: I'm a spoiler type reviewer from time to time, when my reviews take on specific aspects of the plot, so be forewarned.

Try as I might, I just simply couldn't get into this one.  Perhaps it was the washed out tones; perhaps it was the drawn-out approach--I'm not really sure, but though this was by no means a ""bad"" movie, I didn't really find it to be very much of an ""effective"" movie (words that I understand are so much more arbitrary than their common uses).

So, basically, the deal here is that a series of adolescent boys' deaths sets off an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town, triggering a witch hunt.  What do the boys' death have to do with the mysterious, sexy woman who has appeared in town?  Is the crazy hermit woman involved?  Is it voodoo?  The story is a mixture of crime drama and horror as the various townspeople are all suspect and corpses keep appearing while bloody violence ensues.

Good enough, but to me, most of it fell a little flat.  Oh, it had it's moments... the one boy walking in on a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good, and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter commentary (even if the effects themselves failed, considering her skin seemed to peel off as if they were whipping her with red-hot irons).

My biggest issue was the ending.  I've already put spoiler tags on this review, but BE WARNED, HERE'S THE BIG SPOILER: I don't believe it.  I don't believe that a priest could convince himself to kill young boys for becoming sexually aware without some hint of that psychosis appearing earlier, with other boys, with a history, or some other personal affect.  The movie didn't really earn its ending.  END SPOILERS.

Nonetheless, Fulci is a big name and I'm more than certain there's an audience out there for this.  I definitely need to check out more that he's done, because this may have been a poor introduction.  Most Italian giallo is hit-or-miss anyway, so I'm waiting to see what else this guy can do before writing him off.

1077569,4,6305807760,"Italian master filmaker in extreme gore and horror Lucio Fulci, experimented in this 1972 disturbing and tense ""Giallo"" thriller,  a different aproach of collective fear, madness and religious censorship, a work that was actually his best effort before he turned his attention to  atmospheric supernatural horror, zombie nauseous imagery and shocking graphic violence, in classics like ""Zombi"", ""city of the living dead"" or his all-time masterpiece ""The beyond"".

When several young boys are brutally massacred in a southern small italian village, the locals decide to take bloody justice in their own hands: Consumed by fear and ignorance, the supersticious villagers turn against the obvious suspects with violent  rage, and weird misfits fall under the vicious attack of the linching mob. When the police is overwhelmed, a nosy reporter comes to town to investigate the murders, and soon became curious about a young priest and his influence over the villagers, who censors the reading to prevent the corruption of their souls. What continues was an unseen  morbid tale of  sexual desire and creepy explorations of moral values.

With the usual tight budget and time that 70's italian horror movies suffered from, Fulci accomplished a tense, disturbing and gruesome story that actually manages to turn the Italian rural provinces in a hellish scenario, with a cerebral and absorbing tale of  superstition and ignorance, violence and revenge. The moody and dense photography of Sergio D'offizi transforms the beautiful italian landscapes into menacing spaces of  despair, and the haunting and macabre music score of  Riz Ortolani gets under the viewer's skin.

The most effective thriller scripted and directed by Fulci himself, never actually reached the status that deserved, but for fans of Fulci this is the most popular and frightening work. The threatening and creepy atmosphere involving the villager's superstition, religion and dark magic, adding to the macabre situations like the early highlight of a linching mob assasination sequence,  the endless riddles of the tense story and the disturbing encounters with the gore imagery, was a serious demarcation of Fulci over the world of horror cinema: With the minimum resources, a great talented filmaker can create a whole universe of fear, thrills and chills.

George A. Romero's ""Night of the living dead"" was the most outstanding example of an ""accidental"" masterpiece that described with cheap effectiveness the very end of the world, with only few shots of outer lanscapes, an old house and amateur crew and extras, staged media reports on radio and tv,  plastic special effects and great passion and imagination. Now, if Romero could do such a monumental achievement that changed the vision of horror cinema forever, Why the masters of the B-horror movie's style of the 70's, including the grade-A student Tobe Hoper with the milestone ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"", can't be considered genius as well?

The answer is obvious: Classic italian horror filmakers are the very school of  flawed but astonishing achievements with less-than-much budget, but with a cappacity for creating surrealistic ambients and a weird abstraction of fear that borders dementia, an incredible talent that Romero himself wish he had.

It is not by any means his goriest or most f****d up but for the time the child murders and anti-catholic message were unheard of. There are a couple of cool special effects scenes and it is not completely devoid of gore, especially one scene that is reminiscent of ""The Beyond"" (the cliff scene is cool too) and can definitely see the start of a gory career for the maestro. The other great thing about this movie is the music is done by Riz Ortilani, the same man who made the excellent music for ""Cannibal Holocaust"".

1077601,5,6305807760,"Italian director Lucio Fulci is rarely given the credit he deserves. Fulci was a director of great utility, who traversed generic boundaries regularly before he became firmly associated with the horror genre. His final gory step into the horror genre with ""Zombi 2"" was as much the result of economic imperatives and producer influence as it was a conscious decision on Fulci's part. These films were marked by an ambivalence towards conventional narrative patterns, which makes his 1972 effort ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" all the more exceptional. This film is as tightly plotted and efficiently constructed as any giallo film, but with its undertones of peasant superstition, the supernatural and witchcraft, places it firmly within the thematic universe of the director. This is giallo Fulci style and the concessions he makes to the conventions of this form are purely within the remit of iconography. This is a giallo marked by a particularly unsettling atmosphere of hypocrisy and perversion (one only need look toward a truly shocking scene in which a young boy of 12 is prick teased by a naked Barbara Bouchet). This is further augmented into the white washed walls of this rural northern Italian city, and its superstitious villagers, who aren't above a bit of chain whipping vigilante action. Fulci invests a great deal more in the procedures of the police, but ultimately the resolution is arrived at by amateur detectives, who represent both modernity and bourgeois society. The murders of innocent children, intriguingly, are not due to perverse motives, but instead an idealistic religious conviction which sees the modern world as a haven of vices which can only corrupt the innocence of youth. Fulci shows the negative side of both modern Italy and its rural counterpart. By showing that both are marked by ignorance and arrogance, Fulci seems to offer a particularly nihilistic vision of mankind.

 This DVD re-issue by Blue Underground is excellent value for money. The picture quality is very good for a film that has been mishandled and distributed badly for decades. This is a must buy for anyone interested in European horror, not only is it an exemplary giallo, but also Fulci's most rounded cohesive and enjoyable pictures.",1181779200,,2246,5.1506849315068495

The townspeople become paranoid and police seek out the killer. Interesting story, and twist in the end. You think you know who the killer is, but you don't! Great movie. Excellent setting and pace. A must for your Giallo or Italian horror collection.",1176768000,,384,4.661764705882353
1077603,4,6305807760,"Starting in 1979 with the release of Zombie, Lucio Fulci became known for gore movies. That continued through the 80s with a string of gore flicks, which include The Beyond and City of the Living Dead among others. Don't Torture a Duckling isn't your typical Lucio Fulci film at all. There are pretty much no gore scenes, though there are two scenes where Fulci delivers some gore, but I'll touch upon that later on.

Don't Torture a Duckling as I stated before is very different then what Fulci did in the late 70s and 80s. If you're looking for gore you will not find much at all. Actually about half the murders take place off camera. The plot is rather dark; pre-teens being killed is quite disturbing. Gore and violence is not needed when dealing with that subject matter. We also have a woman in her 20s that seems to have a weird sexual attraction to young boys.

It's really a strange movie and like I said unlike most of Fulci's other movies. While yes, Don't Torture a Duckling can be slow in some spots, and my biggest complaint is the sense of dread isn't quite there. Here, Fulci at times creates some great tension and atmosphere and other times it just doesn't work. Oddly enough I found Fulci's gore movies to have more tension at times.

But with that said this is still an excellent movie and Lucio Fulci proves he is more then just a gore director. While some scenes I felt lacked tension others had overall Fulci nailed it. While watching the movie I did enjoy it, but it was afterwards when I thought back I realized how good the movie actually was. There are several things while not directly brought up are hinted at, from sexual repression to pedophilia.

With all that hinted at and all going on in the movie it really does add to the movie and it shows what a talented filmmaker Lucio Fulci was. While I won't spoil who the killer is their motive was really creepy and they didn't do simply because they are psychotic, which yeah sure the killer is, but the motive was downright creepy.

As for the gore; one woman is whipped with chains and while not overly gory like in Fulci's later movies the gore was decent and the scene was really disturbing and with the music playing in the back-round it was even more disturbing. The last death in the movie is also a bit gory, but it's quite clear a dummy was used, but hey it still works well.

If you are a fan of Giallos I would very much recommend Don't Torture a Duckling. And for those who think Fulci is just a gore director should really check this out.

In closing, Don't Torture a Duckling isn't a perfect movie; it can at times be a bit slow and some scenes lack the tension they should have had, but overall Lucio Fulci delivers an excellent film and one of my favorite Giallos.

Co-star Barbara Bouchet has to rate as one of the most beautiful women to ever grace cinema.",1175472000,2,2854,4.422857142857143
1077604,1,6305807760,"Don't get me wrong I love Fulci movies, but I love them for the same reason most other people love them (the gore quotient). Fulci can always be depended upon to splatter tons of blood, guts and gore all over the screen and perhaps this is his way of covering up the fact that he's not the best director. I'd never go into a Fulci movie expecting a deep plot or oscar worthy acting.

With that said I did go into this movie expecting more. Maybe I expected too much and therefore I was very disappointed. Fulci's effort here falls short of suspense, character and atmosphere. Argento's ""Bird With The Crystal Plumage"" blows this film out of the water. Argento's ""Bird"" is intelligent, suspenseful and moves at a good pace. ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" fails to deliver any of the above. The reveiwer above states the movie is up there with Argento's ""Deep Red"" and that statement is as laughable as the way he spelled Fulci(Fulce).

I'm not taking anything away from Fulci. Like I said I love the movies he'd make 7 to 12 years later like ""Zombie"" ""New York Ripper"" ""The Beyond"" and ""City of The Living Dead"". All movies made between 1979 and 1983 as opposed to this one made in 1972. Fulci is known as The Godfather of Gore not the Godfather of Giallo. For good Giallo films check out any Argento film from the 1970's or Mario Bava's ""Bay of Blood"" (1972).",1125014400,5,1355,4.481781376518219
1077605,1,6305807760,"I waited ages to get this Fulci classic and now I wished I did not. It is probably Fulci's most confusing work to date and lacks all known production standards considering this is film #33 from him. I can buy GIALLO being a bit spaced out and highly far-fetched, but this one is just plain bad from start to finish, it is only really remembered for the infamous woman chain whipping sequence (chain whipping also appeared in ""The Beyond""; Fulci loved cashing in on all this stuff), ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is completely void of substance, mystery or crime and instead is replaced by everything that is camp about film making, from the obvious papermashy heads to the ""shall I stand here and act now"" type blemish on everyone's face, considering this is Fulci's 33rd film or thereabouts, it really looks like his first and it would be another 8 years before he made horror, I was expecting a somewhat smart GIALLO and got drawn out rubbish instead. Like I said - Watch ""The Bird with the Crystal Plummage"" GIALLO instead. It was made by Argento two years before this and is where you should be at instead. I would recommend that Argento 'primative slasher' over Fulci's cash crop schlock ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" any day of the week.",1111968000,5,1237,4.65296803652968
1077606,5,6305807760,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching one or two of his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is right up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best filmmakers ever to emerge from Italy. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your craving for gore. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Lucio from my play list altogether, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a competent director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography. ""Zombie"" is without a doubt his best film, but ""The House By The Cemetery"" runs a close second along with ""The Beyond"" and ""The Gates of Hell.""

This giallo, however, is magnificent, as good as many of Dario Argento's efforts. ""Don't Torture a Duckling,"" set in a small village out in the Italian sticks, follows the activities of journalist Andrea Martelli (Tomas Milian) as he attempts to ascertain the identity of a killer preying on children. The first part of the film shows us one of the crimes and introduces us to three of the potential suspects. Possible killer number one is Maciara (Florinda Bolkan), a gypsy and practitioner of black magic whose child passed away some time before. She buried her child out on a hillside only to discover that three local youths desecrated the grave. Her anger over the crime, as well as her ethnicity and the suspicions of the heavily Catholic locals, make her a prime suspect when one of these kids disappears. Possible killer number two is Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), an extraordinarily beautiful young woman with a shady past and a penchant for long drives at night. She also engaged in questionable behavior with one of the victims immediately before he perished. Possible killer number three is the local priest, Don Alberto Avallone (Marc Popel), a strange man who is on intimate terms with all of the youngsters in town thanks to his youth programs.

As the film progresses we learn more about the odd behaviors of the three principal suspects. Maciara, it is safe to say, fails to stay a suspect for long after several men in the town beat her to death with a chain. Patrizia's background rapidly comes to light partly through police investigation and partly through Martelli's persistent inquires. It turns out that she has a history of drug abuse, never a good thing when you're a suspect in a murder investigation, and she is staying in the village because of problems she incurred in Milan. Patrizia eventually teams up with Martelli to help solve the crime, but her continued evasion of critical questions--what about her cigarette lighter at the scene of a crime, for example--keeps her at the top of the list of potential killers. This journalist better watch his back whenever Patrizia is around. As for Don Alberto, well, we soon learn quite a few things about him and his mother Dona Aurelia (Irene Papas) that make us wonder if he isn't the one behind the despicable crimes. The strength of the film, as is the case with all wonderful gialli, is that it keeps us guessing right up to the final minutes. In fact, I think ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" takes us up to the very last minute of the film before revealing the identity of the killer.

The biggest surprise about Fulci's giallo is the lack of heavy gore. Most of us are so used to seeing his over the top gorefests that we assume he never made anything else as memorable. Not true. Besides this gem of a giallo, Fulci also made a spaghetti western (""Four of the Apocalypse""), a science fiction potboiler (""The New Gladiators""), a sword and sandal flick (""Conquest""), and a mafia thriller (""Contraband""). None of these films achieves the greatness of ""Don't Torture a Duckling,"" although ""Four of the Apocalypse"" does come close. While there are a few disturbing scenes here that signal the bloody atrocities to come a few years down the road, such as the chain whipping and a body tumbling down a steep cliff shown in extreme slow motion close up, the movie is a relatively bloodless affair. Fulci seems more interested in launching pointed attacks condemning the Catholic Church, the police, and the irrational prejudices of rural Italians. There's nothing like an old-fashioned murder mystery spiced up with social commentary, eh? Throw in an interesting musical score consisting of lots of twangy strings, and Fulci blends every element into a seamless whole.

The only problem I had with ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" involved the pacing. As good as the film is, it at times slows down to a snail's pace. By the time the credits roll you realize Fulci needed to include everything you just saw in the movie to make it work, but the film still felt slow in parts. Of course, life moves slowly in a small town, so perhaps Fulci merely tweaked his film to match the environment. Anyway, this is a great Italian flick that's sure to entertain. Give it a shot.",1102809600,16,5600,4.69959266802444
1077607,4,6305807760,"Before Fulci earned his title of the ""Godfather Of Gore"", which enhanced(and to some, ruined) his reputation, Fulci made this very entertaining giallo film.  I'm not 100% sure, but I believe this film actually got him blacklisted or something back in the 70s.  Duckling is a story about young boys who are being murdered in a small town.  Who's doing it?  Is it the peeping tom village idiot?  The local wizard?  The witch who sticks pins in(and spits on) wax figures of the boys?  The priest?  The priest's shady mother?  The sexy Annette O'Toole lookalike with a thing for drugs and 12 year old boys?  The reporter?  Or maybe the police themselves?  You'll have to watch it to see, and Fulci does a decent job of keeping us in the dark.  Those buying this for that trademark gore we all love will be disappointed.  There are only two real scenes of violence.  One is identical to the whipping scene in the opening of The Beyond, and the other is the killer's demise which looks pretty silly, but still cool.  This film shows what talent Fulci had, and proves that he wasn't a complete hackmeister....only mostly.  I think there are quite a few critics who actually like this one.  Though low on gore, it's far from p.c.  The subject matter is unsettling enough, but there's quite a tantalizing scene that is every boy's dream come to life.  The leading lady at one point throws herself at one of the boys, but the boy's pesky mother interrupts.  Were young boys allowed to act in scenes with naked women?  I suppose they could in Italy in the early 70s.  Watch it, good flick.",1098662400,6,1578,4.557142857142857
1077608,5,6305807760,"DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is a rare bird in Lucio Fulci's very gilded cage of horror. Made a good seven years before his gorefests, starting with the excellent ZOMBIE, that defined his reputation here in America and the rest of the world, DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is just as intense and brutal, if a bit less gruesome, than the typical Fulci fan is used to. Yet still in all, the story alone (co-written by Fulci) is as much a testament to Fulci's uncompromising and gutsy approach to horror and suspense as any gore scene in his later films (two scenes ended up starting off two later Fulci films). Hell, even the great Dario Argento says that this is one of Fulci's best films (it says so on the cover), and after my first viewing of DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING on New Year's Eve, I can see why; I also saw a lot of George Romeroesque social commentary in this film.
Child murders and disappearances are very galvanizing experiences for any society, especially in a town like in this movie. Everybody is desperate for answers as to who would do such a horrible thing. There have even been a few cases where some townspeople resort to vigilante behavior towards a suspect to satisfy their need for justice. Fulci handles this story in a surprisingly tasteful matter, with only two instances of violence against children; the fact that little boys are being murdered is shocking enough!
There are no likeable characters in the village, which makes the story more immediate and brutal. Even the little boys that are the targets of murder are portrayed as nasty (e.g., spying on naked people, killing animals with slingshots). The recent scandal with Michael Jackson gives more importance to the story arc involving Patrizia, whom one of the boys sees naked. The only character with any appeal is the reporter Andrea Martelli, who is covering the murders. That character is like the outsider that Argento gets you to identify with in his movies, and that plot device works wonders in this story.
The chain-whipping of a local Wiccan by three men as pop music plays from a car radio is the most psychosocially relevant scene in horror history. It speaks volumes about how far some people will go to achieve a degree of justice in the wake of horrible crimes. In this case, these men are driven by superstition since the woman claimed to have placed a spell on the boys because they were messing around her property. That entire sequence, appropiately hard to watch and grisly, tells you all about the moral decay of the entire village. Fulci also used a chain-whipping scene to kick off THE BEYOND, my favorite Fulci film, and it holds the same meaning.
*SPOILER ALERT* We all know how terrifying killers are in slasher movies, but imagine the killer being somebody who should protect you-such as a Clergyman. Just as Romero has always taken potshots at the military (e.g., THE CRAZIES, DAY OF THE DEAD), so Fulci knocks organized religion front and center here. The ultimate motivation behind the killings is a shocking one because it is so misguided. In fact, the eventual demise of the killer (reused for SEVEN NOTES IN BLACK/THE PSYCHIC) is all the more shocking when juxtaposed with some other footage. This plot point has more shock value in the wake of the scandal with the Catholic church of last year! I have never been stunned by a horror film since childhood until this one!
If DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING were to be released in theaters today, it would generate a major firestorm of controversy, especially in light of the aforementioned events in the media. Yes, this movie was definitely too strong for Europeans to stomach back in 1972 (it didn't get released elsewhere at that time) and it remains potent today. A gritty and ground-breaking giallo, Lucio Fulci's DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is a definite must-watch!",1073606400,34,3819,4.7791225416036305
1077609,5,6305807760,"Being a fan of Lucio Fulci and needing a copy of City of Living Dead, I decided to buy the 2 disc set even though I hadn't seen Duckling before, I am lucky I made that decesion.
First of all City is basicly the same plot as Beyond and even stars Catriona MacColl from Beyond. A priest hangs himself opening the gateway to hell and MacColl sees this in a phsycic vision and is scared into a coma. A report saves her from the grave as she is buried alive and they set out to close the gateway. While there are zombies in this film they are noit traditional ones, they have supernatural powers and rip the back of their victims skulls off. The priest zombie makes victims bleed from their eyes and vomit up their guts, this happens in a really great scene. There is also a brilliant head drilling scene, which is in my opinion one of Fulci's best effects. While not as good as Beyond, City is still a great Fulci film, with plenty of atmosphere and Catriona MacColl looking very cute, I haven't seen her in anything but Fulci films, it's a shame though as she is such a cute actress.
Duckling, which I though would be the weak movie, was surprisingly a brilliant. While I have heard of it refered to as a giallo, it really is more of a great mystery involving a series of child murders. While there are a few stalking scenes, Duckling lacks the gloved killer vibe of the standard giallo. What stands out in this film is the lack of Fulci gore, except one scene involving a witch being beaten by vigilantes and also Fulci proves with this film that he is capable of directing a coherrant plot driven film and makes a truely gripping film experience.
While slim on special features compared to the Beyond DVD, Anchorbay has as usual done an exceptional job of transfering these films to DVD. The pictures are generally as crisp as the day they were shot and really any Fulci fan should snap these up as there will never be better versions available.",1049414400,8,1944,4.402777777777778

Hi!  As always, my review is based on QUALITY of the DVD's and not on the movie, acting, or direction.
DUCKLING:  Picture-3.5, Sound-3.5
CITY OF DEAD:  Picture-2.0, Sound-3.0
Thus, my overall rating is 3 stars.  If I was rating ""Duckling"" alone, I would round it up to 4 stars by itself.
This is an excellent two-pack to buy if you enjoy Lucio Fulci.  The price of the two-pack is about the same as if you buy one separately, so get 'em both at once.  The case has kind of a hard-to-get-to insert card because the 2nd DVD flops around on a stiff plastic round.  The insert card has Chapter Lists, one movie on each side -- that's it.
I watched ""City of the Living Dead"" first and I'm glad.  There's not much to enjoy.  The picture is lousy and grainy -- this, from a 1980 film.  It is not true 16x9; in fact, it is more like a box on the screen.  Sound is empty with no depth.  Dolby 5.1?  I don't know; it's barely stereo.  The best part of the movie is seeing Catriona MacColl.
""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is a superb film.  There is a bit of gore, but this movie would earn plenty if released today in theatres.  The sound is listed as mono (true) and is sharp and clear, becoming a bit distorted during loud parts.  It is a true 16x9 picture and superior to ""City of the Living Dead"".
Whew.  Both films feature good-looking female actors, as you'd expect in any Argento, Bava, or Fulci film.  The prize here is Florinda Bolkan -- who gets top billing.  Now I know why.  She is very, very beautiful although in somewhat of a dirty and disheveled role.  She is taller and larger than some of the policemen -- I like that -- and her performance is dramatic and superb.  She did not receive an easy part to perform.  It's always good to find a new female hero although the film is from 1972.  She continues to work in film.  I'm glad I found her, and I will be looking for more of her work.  She literally spells the word GLAMOUR despite the grubby part here.
There is one very disturbing violent scene that many will not enjoy.  I didn't like it one bit, and most women will not either.  Whether it adds to the narrative or belongs in the film is up to you to decide.  This is an ""uncut"" version so I guess Fulci wanted it in there.
There seems to be a transportation challenge in this movie as people on their feet can travel faster than automobiles.  All the scenes are very interesting!
I will view ""Duckling"" again and again.  ""City..Dead"" is probably worth a view once every five years or so.

What makes this movie very unlike what Lucio Fulci makes is that it relies more on suspense, characterization, & disturbing realism other than blood & gore that which he is noted for.
In a small Italian village, young boys are being murdered. Who is responsible for these horrific crimes?
Probably one of the first of its kind of films that deal with the grim reality of serial murder (along with Fritz Lang's M & Ulli Lommell's THE TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES). And when the revelation of the murderer is is truly astonishing & shocking for its time when it was released.
The Anchor Bay video transfer is crisp & bright. They did a marvellous job of bringing this well-made giallo on video the quality is just marvellous.
Barbara Bouchet is mesmerizing as the town tease. Nuff said!

1077662,4,6305807760,"The idyllic Italian countryside, with a highway snaking along concrete supports, with church bells, houses clustered like barnacles on mountains, seems an unlikely place for murders to occur.  Well, guess what happens in the village of Accendura?
Three boys, roughly 11 or 12 years of age, are strangled by an unknown killer.  As the police point out, the killer's a maniac, ""but his minds works in certain logical patterns which has a reasonable meaning to him.""
At first, Giuseppe Barra, the village idiot, is accused, as he is caught picking up ransom money.  Then suspicion falls on Maciara, an outcast and local witch who claims she did kill them for disturbing the grave where she buried her dead and deformed child, but only by making wax effigies and stabbing them with a pin thirteen times so that anyone can kill them.
A further suspect is Patrizia, a hottie who is lying low in Accendura following a drug scandal in Milan.  She is so bored with nothing to do, that when one of the boys, Michaele, brings her orange juice, she, lying stark naked on a sofa, walks up to him, and asks him if he'd like to sleep with her.  That is something that would never if not rarely be touched on in mainstream American cinema.  She drives a cool red dune buggy and carries an expensive golden lighter.  Oh yes, and she really steams things up when she appears.
A reporter, Andrea Martelli, is trying to solve the case and enlists the help of Patrizia.  He also befriends the local priest, Don Alberto, who is worried about the effect material things have upon contemporary society.  While speaking to Martelli about the boys in his flock, he says, ""people aren't worried much about their immortal souls.  They watch TV, go to the movies, they read the paper with all these scandalous photographs...""  He tries to keep the boys occupied by having them play soccer, which is better than them playing in the streets and getting into trouble.  After all, at their age, they're most liable to temptation.  Indeed, there's a scene of Michaele is drawing dirty pictures, probably after seeing Patrizia in the altogether.
The most famous performer here is Irene Papas, and she has a relatively small role in the movie.
The music, with its intense, staccato strings, really helps work the tension up, especially in the opening, when Maciara's dirty hands dig the ground to produce the skeleton of her baby.  And the wailing song that is sometimes heard in the background provides that provincial small village touch.
Originally titled Don't Torture Donald Duck, or in Italian, Non Si Sevizia un Paperino, this giallo thriller ranks alongside Dario Argento's Deep Red.  Small question:  if Lucio Fulce was to make a sequel, would he have called it Don't Kick Mickey Mouse In The (...)?  Just wondering.",1019260800,14,2789,4.813417190775682

1077664,5,6305807760,"Lucio Fulci's Don't Torture A Duckling is a superb little giallo. It features a haunting score, beautiful cinematography, a gripping storyline about the murder of young boys. As the body count increases so do the number of leads and red herrings. A superb little film with a great sense of atmosphere. There is a powerful scene, one of such brutality but it remains integral to the plot. Overall I'd give this film 5/5, the films transfer onto DVD is quite brilliant with hardly any problems, there were only a few hairs and scratches visible for a very short period of time. The transfer looks beautiful, you can hardly believe the film is so old. The sound was fine on the disc, the film has a great music score. The film has no extras but who cares, when a film is this good I don't give a damn about extras. Check this film out if you like good murder mysteries or are a fan of Italian giallo films. This film doesn't rely on the heavy gore techniques that Fulci would use later in his career. Instead the film concentrates on it's characters and the atmosphere. Highly Recommended.
I'd also recommend Fulci's A Lizard in a Woman's Skin.",992217600,15,1141,4.543689320388349
1077665,3,6305807760,"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" obviously comes from an era when director Lucio Fulci--known mostly for his latter-day gore flicks--was more conscious of his audience and critics.  The reason I say this is because, for the most part, the emphasis is on story instead of grisly shocks.  That being said, DTaD may not be so easily accessible for fans of ""Zombie,"" ""The Beyond,"" etc.  But for those who stick with it (and give it at least two viewings), they'll be rewarded with a giallo that is definitely on par with what Dario Argento put out during the '70s.  The story has a murderer making progress through a small town, knocking off children, and the usual red herrings and twists and turns pop up well before the eye-opening ending.  Fulci directs with surprising expertise and coherence, something that would go unseen in his movies until 1982's ""The New York Ripper.""",988761600,,869,4.844594594594595
1077666,3,6305807760,"Why does this film have such an odd title? Does it include zombie ducks? Or exessive scenes of bird torture? No. Sorry, Fulci horror buffs may be disappointed with this one, but it's actually a pretty good film. It's more of a ""giallo"" mystery, concerning the murders of young boys in a small rural village, and does provide an entertaining story, but with hardly any gore, and a tiny bit of completely gratuitous nudity from Barbera Bouchet in a completely wasted role. Well, some scenes showing the corpses of small children may upset viewers, but there isn't really much to upset the stomach, as no child murders are graphically shown. What is most memorable, however is the sickening death that accompanies the climactic unmasking in the final few minutes, a seriously unpleasant scene involving a cliff edge, but capped with a surprisingly poetic denouement...worth holding out for. This film has certain similarities with Argento shockers, but it wasn't until later, with the mind-boggling ""Aenigma"" that Fulci really tried to copy Argento (""Aenigma"" is ""Phenomena"" with snails!!) Try that one for size, it's hilarious, but watch ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" in a more serious mood, and you will enjoy it as a surprisingly effective film.",982627200,,1242,5.0931372549019605
1077667,3,6305807760,"I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end.  And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.",969580800,5,555,4.721649484536083

7895211,5,6305807760,"The following unedited review appeared first on Mind of Tatlock.

Lucio Fulci has a varied career of cinematic weirdness, which ranges from gory zombie flicks, psycho slashers and quirky Giallos. This time around my review is going to about a quirky Giallo named Dont Torture a Duckling. If you're wondering what this little Duckling is about, its a convoluted, red herring filled murder mystery where it will leave you rightfully confused all the way to the end.

Lucio Fulci has decided that he was going to write and direct a murder mystery that was going to be filled with so much random shit, it almost comes across as comical. We have a mysterious woman who practices black magic, who may or may not be using the magic to kill the local boys. We have the weird loony who doesnt like the local boys. We have the gorgeous Barbara Bouchet, who fancies the local boys a bit too much, as in entering possible jailtime territory. All of it is mixed together and thrown at the wall, hoping that it sticks.

Does the messy story work? Surprisingly enough, it does. There is a lot that is not needed, which makes the story harder to follow, but in the end, once the killer is revealed, it all works in the end. The lunacy that is thrown into the flick, like the witch, is placed there to convey the towns craziness and out of touch morals. It also allows for Fulci to shoot a very graphic scene that is somewhat hard to watch.

Short answer Dont Torture a Duckling is classic Fulci all the way. Its a twisty, loopy story that packs in an abundance of quirky characters, but keeps the viewers in the dark as to who is behind the madness. Its a fun ride.

Violence

This is a Fulci flick, so there is some graphic violence on display here. We have children being murdered, a woman being savagely beaten and also a death that is hilarious looking, but explicit as well.

Sex/Nudity

Barbara Bouchet provides all the nudity in this flick, and its glorious. She is a drop-dead gorgeous.

Interesting Elements

The hilarious, cheesy death scene. I won't spoil it.
Barbara Bouchet. Beyond interesting actually.
Was I this horny as a twelve-year-old boy?

Blu-ray

Arrow Video has done a splendid job on the video transfer for the movie. Its so clear and pristine in places. The booklet in the package provides a lot of information on the transfer, so much information, in fact, it seems like Arrow Video is coming across as apologising for any issues, but I see no problems with this one.

Audio is also near perfect, with both a lossless Italian and English track. No complaints from this easy to impress reviewer.

Special Features are filled with plenty of interviews. We get an enjoyable older audio interview with Fulci. I liked the essay about Fulcis problems of being labelled as a misogynistic director. She provides plenty of pointers that show you that he wasn't misogynistic at all. I also admire the lovely cardboard sleeve supplied with the package. I know, small things impress me.

Verdict

Dont Torture a Duckling might be utterly confusing and convoluted at times, but Fulci has a certain quirkiness and raw grittiness in his films, that makes you always end up liking it and this film is no different. Arrow Video racks up another top Blu-ray in their ever-growing library of amazing releases.",1507248000,5,3301,4.685121107266436

  It was well worth the buy, as is usual for the Arrow Editions.  The picture restoration is of course AMAZING, in and of itself.  The commentary & rare interviews by Fulci are alone worth this edition.  Plus actor interviews, etc.  I really like this edition.  For those who like Fulci, this is a great edition to have.
  Arrow has made an excellent edition!!",1507075200,4,590,4.37037037037037
