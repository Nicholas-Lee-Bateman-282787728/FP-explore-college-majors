411526,5,6302000912,"I don't know why I didn't expect much from this set - somewhow I visualized a lot of talking heads telling me about every astronomer from Newton forward and backward.  Not!
The series uses current astronomers to explain the theory they are investigating, complete with research steps and glorious pictures of what they saw and hoped to see.  It was not biographical, but historical. The story line was the development of a theory.  Several astronomers and their work were used, for example, to explain dark matter - what it was, the theory, and how they hoped to prove something that cannot be seen.  Planets, star birth and death, supernovi,searching for the moment of creation, and other current matters of interest are given one tape each.
I am not saying this as well as I might. These videos taught me while keeping me so entertained that I just watched the set straight through.  It was neither too simplistic nor was it over my head.
I liked it well enough to search the box with a magnifying glass for the producers so I could go to their web site and find other masterpieces. Sigh! They were a one masterpiece group.
You won't be disappointed in this one - and if I didn't say so, the visuals are gorgeous and unusual.",1001548800,49,1227,4.610091743119266
411527,5,6302000912,"This set of videos does an excellent job of covering the field of astronomy in a comprehensive fashion. It covers both professional and amateur astronomy.

It has segments featuring John Dobson, who teaches  amateur astronomers how to build their own telescopes and travels to public  events to familiarize people with astronomy.

There are also segments on  the many different areas of professional astronomy, including astronomers  studying the stars and planets as well as those studying astrophysics and  cosmology.

There are interviews with the astronomers where they talk  about their work, how they got involved in the field, and segments on how  they work to bring an interest in the field to young people.

The focus of  the series is on astronomers themselves, but there are also many current  subjects in the science of astronmy discussed, such as the structure of  large groups of galaxies, the cores of galaxies, gravity, and so on.

I  highly recommend this series for anyone with an interest in astronomy or  those who are astronomers. If you or someone you know has an interest in  becoming an astronomer, either as an amateur or a professional, this series  is indispensible.",961804800,50,1193,5.0880829015544045

7819646,5,6302000912,"Very original, documenting rarely seen footage of behind-the-scenes events that are of great interest to astronomy buffs. Would highly recommend.",1364515200,,145,6.3
7819647,5,6302000912,"I didn't expect this program to be as charming as it was.  By that I mean I truly admire and respect the amateur astronomers and astrophysicist that have the passion to turn their telescopes beyond the heavens and bring the beauty and wonders to all of us. Yes this was made in the early 90's but it's such a gem and i'm so glad to own it! If you are truly becoming interested in the studies the cosmos, then I hope you find this video as informing and fun as I did. Cheers!",1339200000,2,474,4.096774193548387
7819648,5,6302000912,"The Astronomers.  This series when first shown on PBS, was enlightening.  Showing how a home constructed telescope was made to viewing through some of the largest telescopes in the world was amazing.  Even today, this series is excelent to be viewed by the family or passed along.  It really captures what it is to see ""first light"".",1332720000,,333,4.7894736842105265
7819649,5,6302000912,"This set is one of the best pieces of work that has ever been made in the field of astronomy documentaries. Slick, top-notch production, with a great balance of the personal insights and technical information of the scientists. Cinema quality in every aspect, the views of the observatories and the universe that surrounds us will give you an appreciation of science that will last a lifetime. Even the music score is absolutely immaculate. I say bravo! It is worth any price.",1311897600,2,476,4.888888888888889
7819650,5,6302000912,"The reviews for this video have gotten mixed up with reviews for another video called ""Winston's Potty Chair"" for some crazy reason.  The Astronomers is a great video.  All the reviews for it are 5-stars except for one 4-star and one 2-star.",1310515200,,241,4.714285714285714
7819651,5,6302000912,"This a good overall review of a relatively obscure profession. Earning a living in astronomy isn't easy and one does it more out of love than money. Much of a person's time is spent with distractions such as proposals, scheduling, and fund raising. This applies to teaching as well as research. Its not for the faint-of-heart. The program exemplifies this aspect very well. Remember, this is primarily about the profession with science thrown in. Its story telling style is very entertaining.",1308700800,,492,5.08641975308642
7819652,5,6302000912,"This series was produced in 1990.  I was a fan of the original PBS series and watched the VHS tapes.  The series discusses topics like dark matter,  the microwave background and exoplanets that were cutting edge in the early '90's.  These topics are in the news to-day and even though they have advanced since 1990, the quality of the series' presentation is so top notch, it still fascinates in 2007.  It is also very entertaining with magical graphics and music.  For the astronomy buff the DVD is an historical record.  For the novice, it is an introduction to the grass roots work of astronomers.",1168560000,3,600,4.711538461538462
7819653,4,6302000912,"I own the VHS tapes of this series and enjoyed it very much.  It has beautiful visual effects and shows much about the personal lives of the astronomers.  It would have been even better if Carl Sagan, the most lively and interesting astronomer of our time, had been involved in the making of this series. Unfortunately, he does not even appear in any of the episodes. A decade had passed since the Cosmos series, and Sagan, perhaps because of health reasons, was apparently unable to contribute his talents to this project.  But it is a very compelling series since you can see the work astronomers do from a very personal perspective.  The graphics and animation are attractive and appealing with the use of the best technology that was available at that time.",1155600000,3,761,4.742424242424242
7819654,2,6302000912,"viewed it 1st was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching,waiting,hoping!!!,the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough, must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the picture. My advise is for you to save your money and buy comos (the best imo)To be honest, i couldn't wait to sell it used at a $10 lose through amzn.the following week(they get a commission for sold items)nonetheless,i am content i no longer own it. Next time i will rent before purchasing on amzn. Just So you know, ""cosmos"" i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from amzn..the late carl sagans""cosmos"" blows away ""the astronomer""",1140134400,,724,4.62015503875969
