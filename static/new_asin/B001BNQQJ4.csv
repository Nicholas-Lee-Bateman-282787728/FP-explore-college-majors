8283894,5,B001BNQQJ4,"I chose top rating because it is the best historical prophecy of this age.
There is no reason to dislike an historical writing as significant as this is.  It's 'written in stone' as one man's revelation as to what will happen in former ages and especially in this final age.  It shows the wisdom which has been given to those who seek the truth.
Anyone who has also sought the truth of Biblical prophecies can understand the wisdom of those who have studied it in a former age and gain strength from the evidence of the presence of a Creator who has been with us since the beginning and will be there throughout eternity.",1388534400,,621,4.43859649122807
