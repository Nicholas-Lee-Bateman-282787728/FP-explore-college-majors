This disc also does not have the same wealth of extra features as the first season.  What it has is fun, but there are fewer than the first season offered.  This disc is basically for die-hard RT fans only, or for people who are stoned.",1364256000,,444,4.301204819277109
8448126,5,B004YCP9VA,"Fantastic and funny shorts! Just like what you would expect from Rooster Teeth. Even though all the shorts are free on Rooster Teeth's website, the DVD gives you higher quality and tons of extra goodies. This is definatly a must buy for any fan, but buy from Rooster Teeth's site.",1309305600,,280,4.62
