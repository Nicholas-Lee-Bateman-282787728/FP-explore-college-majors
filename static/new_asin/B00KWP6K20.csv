6452579,4,B00KWP6K20,I like this film. Greer Garson is believable as a grieving war widow whose life is suspended until a deranged young man comes posing as her husbands war comrade. He's full of uncanny information about the life she shared with her husband (Robert Mitchum). He (Richard Hart) seduces her by becoming that somewhat familiar presence of her lost husband who truly holds her heart.  I think it's definitely worth viewing!,1416182400,6,416,4.942857142857143
6452580,3,B00KWP6K20,"This was an MGM oddity that I have just seen for the first time.  It got disastrous reviews on release and all the directors involved wanted no credit. This is to my knowledge the only MGM film and maybe the only one that has no director credit.  Despite all this I found the film well mounted with excellent photography, good film score and really good performances by all the actors. Miss Garson looks lovely as always and is always a pleasure to watch.  Robert Mitchum paired well with Miss Garson and turned in a good performance.  The film is worth owning.  Not all films can be great, but this is not really as bad as all I've been reading over the years.",1408752000,18,661,4.385245901639344

I am very glad I did! Greer Garson delights again in this touching story of wartime relationships. The scenery is spectacular and the cast is marvelous.",1453507200,,307,4.310344827586207

6452586,3,B00KWP6K20,I happened to come across this movie on amazon. The synopsis sounded so suspenseful and intriguing that I wanted to ad it to my collection. Unfortunately I found it to be drawn out and not suspenseful at all. It lacked luster and the performances were not on their game. I was somewhat disappointed.,1445731200,2,299,4.660377358490566

6452590,4,B00KWP6K20,"Beautiful and atmospheric.  Where on earth did they get the village, the coastal house, those cliffs?  Was that what France looked like after the War?  Were those old customs and ceremonies still honored?  Wonderful film to look at, good story of an unscrupulous POW camp survivor taking advantage of a young widow's vulnerability.  Robert Mitchum is younger than I've ever seen him in movies and astonishing to behold...there's a shadowy profile where he's considering running out into the fog and danger, his face is mythic!  I liked this movie very much, the players were excellent, the location stunning.",1419984000,10,608,5.153061224489796

 Light, enteretaiing story, (adapted from The Last of Mrs. Cheney) very fun cast, especially the character acters of this era. FMI, See the other reviews, and IMDB site.",1531699200,,263,4.844444444444444

8662259,4,B00KWP6K20,"Well then.  Take the most beautiful vase in the world, oh painted by blind nuns if you wish, precious beyond ,,,,  then smash it in to thousands of pieces...... oh, you can do that with a film, this film.  Let me talk about what I like first.  Richard Hart was beautiful.  He was young and his voice was as a singer singing.  He could be soft and tender, almost naked enough, enough for the viewer to love this man.  M.G.M. was desperately trying to find another Gable.  This actor was in two films and faded away and died young of a heart attack.  Well,  Try to imagine him in films later on.  He and Lana Turner in a modern film in glorious color.  A modern mystery someone dead, and nobody cares about it.  Close ups, and legs moving only.
Mayer was said to adore Garson, Garson is to old in the part.  There are moments when she has hair one length and then it gets short again, then long.  My suspicion is that having ''Adventure'' not setting the world on a spin, and I love ''Adventure'', Joan Blondell keeping life worth living.  So Richard Hart makes a film with Garson and then with Turner, maybe the other way around, ''Green dolphin Street''.  The man was beautiful and his voice was wonderful.  Cukor drives me nuts with his great ability with women in film.  I have this idea that Gable was not to thrilled in the way that he came home sexy man/ no!  Sexy Garson equal with Blondell.  Was Gable a little pissed off that a Gable role without Gable and the director that Gable loved to hate was passed by?  Why all this GIGANTIC STORY about a film without a director.  The continuity is missing.  Ok.  A war story and missing men.  The lady finds a man that excites her after being alone so long.  They are about to be married.  And the husband comes home and doesn't like that.  That is basically the story of ''Desire Me''.  Had Mayer ben a gent. he might have offered the idea to Garbo, and with Garbo the pace would have been different.  Garbo would have enjoyed Richard Hart.  That Hart was somehow cast aside and died so young, nearly breaks my heart.",1492214400,,2069,4.349081364829396
8662260,5,B00KWP6K20,Greer Garson is in a class all by itself. Wonderful print. Good fast service. Happy.,1485648000,2,84,4.666666666666667
8662261,5,B00KWP6K20,any movie that Greer Garson is in...I would probably give it a 5 star rating....became a fan after watching Mrs. Miniver...great actress,1482105600,,136,5.2272727272727275
8662262,5,B00KWP6K20,"There are no explosions, murder, or flying heroes, just great acting by Mitchum and Garson. This is a great old move, well worth the time to watch it, and the money to buy it.",1478822400,,175,4.176470588235294
8662263,2,B00KWP6K20,"I love old movies, especially those with Robert Mitchum but this is far from his - or Greer Garson's - best. Both usually give down-to-earth, realistic, performances but this is not one of those times. Mitchum isn't on screen much, as he is presumed killed trying to escape a POW camp at the beginning of the movie. He doesn't show up again until towards the end, when it is discovered he is alive. Most of the movie is given to Richard Hart, a little known actor, who plays the villain. Whether the writing and direction are actually bad or badly dated makes no difference. No one watching this movie today is likely to be able to buy into the choices Garson's character makes. Hart plays a man who knew her husband in the camp and has become obsessed with Garson. She comes home one day to find a total stranger has made himself at home in her house. He speaks mysteriously about knowing her and only belatedly states he knew her husband. He doesn't give her his name and she doesn't ask but invites him to stay. The idea that a woman living in an isolated area would invite this creepy stranger to sleep in her house because he claims he saw her husband die, is weird. He has ""stalker"" written all over him. A sane person - even in the 1940s - would have kept her distance, not invited him to stay. Her behavior throughout the movie is that of an hysterical, irrational person. Not the Greer Garson most of us know. Neither she nor Hart are appealing characters and this is just not a movie that has stood the test of time.",1475625600,2,1526,4.376760563380282
8662264,5,B00KWP6K20,This is a film in the grand old style. Garson is radiant in a very nice story of WWII.  Mitchum in one of his early roles is good and on the money. Rugged locales and great music make this one one to watch.,1475193600,,206,3.7906976744186047
