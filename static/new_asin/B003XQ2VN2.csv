8408478,4,B003XQ2VN2,"I just want to tell people who love supehero movies that Daredevil,Elektra & the Fantastic Four are really great movies.
They rate up there with other superhero movies. I think there should have been second movies made for Daredevil & Elektra.
Fantastic Four should have a third movie because I loved this cartoon when I was a child. I would recommend these movies to
everyone who loves superheros.",1363564800,,398,4.867647058823529
