I have seen most of Cirque du Soleil's productions and I was not impressed with La Nouba. Age aside, many of Cirque's older shows are still far beyond the level of La Nouba. It's stage seems empty and bland, the characters are uninviting, the acts are less than ordinary, and the magic of Cirque is absent.

La Nouba presented by Cirque Du Soleil

****

La Nouba is a permanent venue at Disney Worlds Downtown Disney which according to its promotions is about the meeting of two worlds between The Cirque and the Urbains and when these two groups meet something magical happens. Cirque Du Soliel is more of an exhibition than a theatre performance and as result does not have a much in the way of story. Again, it is more about incredible stunts and incredible music rather than plot. The closest thing to a plot this performance has is that the Cirque and the Urbains, come into conflict and then at the end, come into harmony.

Unlike KA which had a tribal theme, La Nouba is clearly based off of the three ring circus, with clowns, strongmen, and acrobats. Perhaps a way of paying homage to the origins of Cirque Du Soliel, which has been stated as being an evolution of the circus.

The play does a good job with its theme. The circus motif is clearly visible and all of the performers are visually represented as clowns or mimes. Color is a strong theme that is conflicted with the stark surroundings of the theatre. The costumes too, are very colorful and distinguished with Cirque Du Soliel signature style.

The sheer skill of the performers is absolutely superb. The amount of practice required to pull off such stunts must be everything but all consuming. One must start out young when in the sport of gymnastics while the body is still malleable enough to handle all of that stress. The various stunts are just as impressive and the amount of dedication required to perfect them is beyond reason for the smallest misstep can result in disaster.

As always the music is superb and adds a classic Cirque Du Soleil twist to the classic circus horns. It knows when to be energetic and a little more solemn. A combination of the two characteristics has been a signature of the three Cirque Du Soleil shows CurtainWorm has seen.

One of the main features of this show is the two clown characters which guide the audience between acts. While the backstage is getting ready, the duo entertain the audience with a small bit. The clowns are both visually distinct and seem to have their own personalities. Personality is not particularly important but it is a nice touch. The bits themselves are rather hit and miss. Sometimes they are funny but sometimes CurtainWorm found himself looking at his watch. Still, it is good something as avant-garde as Cirque Du Soliel keep in touch with iconic members of the circus.

Speaking of personal experience from the CurtainWorm, if you ever get yourself down to Florida and take in a showing, be sure to not get seats in the very front as you will find yourself straining your neck in order to see the higher up acrobatic routines.

If you ever find yourself in Downtown Disney, you should definitely give La Nouba a try.

Nouba has more traditional clowns and I must admit that I am a clown too, a real graduate from Clown Camp, not the life of the party kind.
The entire performance is spectacular, but my purchase of this CD was specific.
I will spend the rest of my life trying to learn the double chair routine.

2139166,3,B0002XNSZY,"La Nouba has played at Walt Disney World West Side for over 10 years.  It's about time they changed shows.  The first time I saw this show, there are no words to describe the visual along with the artristy of the peformers along with the haunting music.  This is the most impressive show in all of Disney World, bar none.  I have one word of caution.  When I took my childrens to see it, my son bought the tickets online and was told there were no bad seats in the house... WRONG, WRONG you absolutely do not want to sit near the front of the theatre.  You can see only about 1/2 of the show, all of the things that are going on in the top of the arena you can not see.  Needless to say after all my praise about the show... My childrens were less than impressed.

Be prepared to pay upwards of $80 plus dollars for the show but it's worth every penny.  Compared to Disney asking price for entrance into the parks it's a pittance.  I promise you, you will not be this entertained in any park in Disney World",1330646400,,1007,4.144329896907217
2139167,5,B0002XNSZY,"I recently saw this show in Orlando and wanted to bring it back for my kids.
This unique blend of classical arts of the circus combined with ballet, and many performing arts tricks will dazzle the eye and keep all ages entertained.

My kids all LOVED it and the entire hour and a half kept them occupied.  They are from age 9 to 2 1/2.  In fact my 2 1/2 loves to watch bits and pieces of it as often as we would let him.

You will find yourself sitting in awe and amazement at the sheer talent and choreographing that is involved in this show.

YouTube doesn't do this justice.  You need to buy this DVD.
I can not wait till they come to town again so as to take my entire family to watch.
Each element from the music, to the singers, to the clowns, to the gymnasts to the lights... everything is done with such professional precision that you will be left in sheer wonder like a child while watching!",1329436800,,901,4.179190751445087

2139246,3,B0002XNSZY,"There is no way you can compare a Cirque du Soleil live show and one on DVD, so I cannot say anything critical about the content of this video.  If you have ever seen a show live, you know that there is far too much going on at one time for a camera to take in, and that the music and acts can only be truly appreciated when heard and seen in person.  However, the quality of the sound and picture of this DVD is a really big letdown.  I have seen Varekai on DVD and the colors are vibrant, the sound clear and wonderful.  La Nouba looks like someone filmed it with a camcorder.  The colors are dull, the picture fuzzy, and the sound less than impressive.  I am thoroughly disappointed.  I'm not particularly picky about picture & sound quality (I don't expect everything to be state of the art) but this is just not good.  Unless maybe I just got a bad DVD (is that possible?), this is not really what it should be.",1142985600,19,916,4.1647727272727275

  Last night 02/23/06 A friend and myself went to Detroit to see the new offering ""Delirium"" from these talented performers, my first time in person, IT too was spectacular. Can't wait for that DVD.

The living wheel segments are incredibly beautiful, and the trampoline act toward the end of the show will blow your mind! The finesse of the trampoline artists jumping onto and INTO buildings is spellbinding! It's off the mark to argue that a filmed presentation of a live show like La Nouba is not the same thing as being there; of course it isnt, and cannot be. But the cameras are consistently used with intelligence and artistic fire, and fully capture the essence of the live show. Once again, the musical score for La Nouba is scintillating and always beautiful, sampling jazz, Latin funk, European pop - original music of the highest quality. This troupe continues as one of the artistic wonders of the world. Dont miss this amazing dvd. It's a must have if you're a Cirque du Soleil fan, and the perfect way to become one if you've yet to experience these athlete artists. Unequivocally recommended - get this unforgettable dvd performance with confidence!",1137715200,9,1140,4.762626262626263

I visited Disney World's Epcot and MGM theme parks as well as Universal Orlando's Universal Studios, and La Nouba made my trip. The set was colorful and very interesting. The performers were beyond talented. They were spellbinding. The program included acrobats, a high wire act, trick bike riding, four little girls who performed a skin tingling juggling act while they did acrobats (they were the most exciting), and other performers. There was something going on, constantly, and I never got bored. So, I bought this DVD right outside the theatre so that I could enjoy the show over and over again. However, it wasn't exactly the program I saw; as I was told by the seller. The arrangement was different and alot of the program was cut out. For example, the little girls segment was cut drastically short and their performance was what I wanted to see the most. The audio is poor. The DVD just doesn't do the live show justice. The second disc in this set contains interviews of some of the performers. It doesn't include enough info on the performers. I  guess if I had not seen the live performance, this DVD may have received a higher rating. I realize that this show was recorded at an earlier date and some changes have been made in the live performance since its recording i.e there were 3 little girls performing in the DVD set,but 4 performed the night I saw them. However, I just can't help being disappointed!!! If you are ever in Florida and have an opportunity to visit Downtown Disney, go see La Nouba live. The tickets are high($61-91.00/ticket) but worth every cent. I guess I should mention that I paid twice as much for this DVD as listed by Amazon!!!",1127865600,8,1827,4.621538461538462

2139252,4,B0002XNSZY,"I saw La Nouba last July, second row, during my visit to Orlando, FL.  How I felt watching this amazing show cannot be described with words.  My only complaint was that there were WAY TOO MANY THINGS going on at once on that stage.  I didn't know where to place my attention.  I bought the DVD to remember this great experience, and with the hopes that I could appreciate the show better.  Like some other reviewer commented, the editing is done very akwardly.  The scenes switch from one to another so fast that I couldn't concentrate, hence my dissapointment came.  The show itself is fantastic.  The clowns are nothing but hilarious and the performers beyond perfect.  This DVD is an amazing way to relive my experience over and over again!",1124582400,2,743,4.653846153846154
2139303,5,B0002XNSZY,"After catching a few minutes of the amazing trampoline act on the Bravo channel, I bought this not only so I could see the rest of the show but so I could loan it to my friends.  The trampoline act alone is worth the price.  I believe it to be without question the single best act of all the Cirque du Soleil shows I've ever seen.",1123632000,3,330,3.984848484848485
2139304,5,B0002XNSZY,"What can one say about Cirque? It's simply undescribable, and this show proves it again. If your budget doesn't allow it, specially if you live far from Florida, what better way to watch La Nouba than in DVD? Once again the combination of nearly all of the arts makes this a performance to remember, though the video editing looks somewhat hazy at times, but not in a way that interferes with your enjoyment of the show.

The theme this time around is an urban theme, mostly noted in the acts and its jazzy, hip-hop influenced music. The acts are very varied, and they're all flawlessly executed by awe-inspiring artists, though there's a rather bland BMX act that's nonetheless difficult to perform. One of the musical highlights is the use of a counter-tenor as the male vocalist; I don't know why, but it just seems to blend perfectly with the music and general theme of the show

The DVD this time around is just as loaded as Varekai, disc 1 once again has the show available in 3 types of sound encoding. Disc 2 has all the extras, though saddly there's no multi-angle feature or ""Meet the Artists"" this time, but the latter is replaced by an equally interesting ""Meet the Musicians"". There's also cast interviews, a picture gallery and more.

In short, another excellent choice for anyone, whether you are a Cirque fan or not.",1114214400,5,1332,4.659574468085107
2139305,5,B0002XNSZY,"I just finished viewing ""La Nouba"" and I have to say that it displaces ""O"" as my second favorite Cirque du Soleil show. ""Quidam"" remains my favorite and the gold standard against which all other shows must be measured. In addition to these three, I've seen ""Mystere"", ""Zumanity"", ""KA"", ""Varekai"", ""Alegria"", ""Saltimbanco"", and ""Dralion"". It's no coincidence that my top three picks are all creations of Franco Dragone, who unfortunately, has left the company. All three also feature the music of Benoit Jutras. The artistry, surrealism, visual imagery, and music are all earmarks of a Dragone/Jutras show. There are some similarities between Quidam and La Nouba which might be the reason they are my favorites. They share some of the same acts such as the ""German Wheel"" and ""Diabolos"". The German Wheel acts are a bit different because in Quidam, there is only one wheel whereas in La Nouba, there are two. The result is that the single performer in Quidam maintains a faster, more acrobatic, pace where the duo in La Nouba act in sync. The Diabolos acts are virtually identical in both shows, except that Quidam's version has a spectacular ending that is lacking in La Nouba's. In both shows, the finale is the main event of the show - ""Banquine"" in Quidam and ""Power Track (PT)/Trampoline"" in La Nouba. Although ""PT/Trampoline"" is absolutely superb, ""Banquine"" remains my favorite of any act in any Cirque show. The combination of artistry, music, costumes, and unbelievable acrobatic ability in Banquine is sheer perfection. The weakest acts are the ""Cloud Swing"" in Quidam and ""Cycles"" in La Nouba. I've never really liked the clown acts in any of the Cirque shows and these two are no exception. Most Cirque shows have one or possibly two acts that are good enough to be the main event. La Nouba has two - ""PT/Trampoline"" and ""Flying Trapeze"". Quidam has three - ""Banquine"", ""Skipping Ropes"", and ""Statue"". Most main event acts feature large casts of at least 8-10 people and usually more. ""Statue"" is perhaps the only main event-quality act that has only two people. The one other advantage that Quidam has over La Nouba, at least on DVD, is the singing voice of Audrey Brisson-Jutras who is the daughter of musical composer Jutras. The lead vocalist in La Nouba is amazing, but there is something magical and haunting about Audrey's voice that sends chills up my spine every time I view Quidam. The reason that ""O"" drops to third place is that, as wonderful a show as it is artistically, the acrobatics are weak compared to most other shows. ""O"" does not contain a main event-quality acrobatic act. One other difference between Quidam and La Nouba is that La Nouba, with acts such as ""High Wire"", ""Balancing on Chairs"", and ""Flying Trapeze"" more closely resembles a traditional circus than Quidam. Both Quidam and La Nouba are ""must have"" DVDs for anyone who enjoys the Cirque du Soleil.",1111017600,35,2895,4.874239350912779
2139306,5,B0002XNSZY,"I have to criticize the editing of this DVD.  I saw La Nouba in person in Orlando this last winter and loved it (front row seat on right side).  I purchased this DVD just outside the doors of the building.  The first part of the DVD they do this 2 second collage segment instead of showing more of the initial parade.  Some of it is cool but I didn't care for it.  Reminds me of what the big networks did to us in the 1970's (show ""previews"" of the show you are about to watch for 5 minutes).

Having said the above, even though it may be painful, watch through it anyway.  It is worth it.  The begining is AMAZING!  If you can fast forward, look for a screen with a countdown 4 - 3 - 2 - 1, fade.  They even have a character that rides a bike on a wire about 20' above the floor - upside down!  Yes, that is right, the bike and the guy riding it are upside down as if gravity has been reversed.  I have watched this DVD more times than I can remember and would like to watch it some more.  This is why I say use your best DVD player so you can go back and forth.  The video quality is excellent (s-video if you have it).

They have a 2nd DVD that contains interviews with some of the performers.  This is amazing stuff.  How they paint themselves, prepare for a show, and how some of their characters came about.  They also interview the musicians.

I haven't felt like that since I was at a Ringly Brothers Barnum Baily circus as a child in the early 1970's.  Great show Cirque!",1107302400,14,1480,4.055363321799308
2139307,5,B0002XNSZY,"I have seen La Nouba live 8 times and the DVD captures all of the excitement of being there.  The show is awesome, and the performers are unbelieveable!

2139308,5,B0002XNSZY,"I had the chance to watch this spectacular show live on year 2000 and from the first moment I was amazed! Me and my friends were clapping all the time, so the rest of the audience, and this is just a natural thing to do when you get to see this circus...This is great, the best and a must at least once in your lifetime....but in the meantime get the DVD, which I was waiting for so long",1101772800,,387,3.9743589743589745
2139309,5,B0002XNSZY,"I have yet to see this DVD, but I did get the chance to see La Nouba live last June 03. La Nouba is by far the best live show I have ever seen in my life.  Every single second was awe-inspiring. The performers amazing talent and skill just grabs your attention and you can't peel your eyes away from them. Every single one of the acts are amazing.  I particularly loved Diabolos and Arial Ballet in Silk.  Arial Ballet In Silk just had this feel of romanticism that I loved.  Diabolos was my favorite , though.  Those little girls had so much talent and grace and everyone in the theatre gave them a standing O!

 From the minute the first acts came out, I remember realizing that I wouldn't leave feeling like the same person I did coming in....And I was right.  After seeing it live, you leave with this feeling of being a new person. So much adrenaline is rushing through your body and you just feel rejuvinated with not a care in the world.

I can't wait to get this DVD.  It'll be a wonderful way to remember the fun I had on one of the best (and most inspiring) nights of my life. I recommend this to anyone.  I would recommend going to see this show live as well though to get the whole expirence.  It's hard to explain the feeling it gives you, but you won't be the same person afterward, I assure you.  It's been over a year later and that feeling has yet to wear off.",1101513600,2,1377,4.190114068441065

2139311,5,B0002XNSZY,"If this DVD is anything like the live show in Orlando, Florida, it is a definite must have.

I would describe La Nouba as freak show meets the circus meets broadway. That is exactly what this is. I sat front row at the theater and loved every minute of it. There is so much activity happening on stage I wanted to get tickets for the following day show so I could see it all over again.

AWESOME!! worth every penny.",1100044800,,416,4.1875
2139312,5,B0002XNSZY,"I have other Cirque DVDs....I guess what made the anticipation greater was that they were never going to film one of their ""resident"" shows. Now that it finally here, it is great. The brilliant shots of the various acts are really impressive. It was good news to see that there were no acts that had been cut out (like the other Crique DVDs). The whole show is there. But, does it give you a reason to either go see it live for the first or third time? Yes it does, there is no topping the ""in person"" experience. Also, I was glad that Cirque released another 2 Disc DVD. It was money well spent.",1099526400,4,596,4.2368421052631575
