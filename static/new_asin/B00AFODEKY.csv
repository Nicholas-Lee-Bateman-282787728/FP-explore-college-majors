8551014,5,B00AFODEKY,"I've been trying to think of what to say about this for a few weeks now.  It is one of the funniest movies I've seen.  It fits well within the mo lei tau (T: S:) category.  There's a great disclaimer screen at the beginning that lists some of the actors who refused to participate

A couple of suggestions, however:

This is based on a framework of 'A Chinese Odyssey' (both parts) and much of the in-between action is based on 'Red Cliff' (both parts).  At least see 'Red Cliff' first; otherwise you'll end up giggling at odd moments when you eventually see it (I did).

The Wikipedia article on this lists all of the movies parodied in one way or another.  Many are parodied simultaneously.  For example, there's one scene that parodies 'A Chinese Odyssey' and 'Titanic' at the same time.

This thing is great fun.  Strongly recommended.",1370649600,,839,4.601351351351352
8551015,4,B00AFODEKY,"Right from the start you sense a comedic, spoofy, parody of Chinese classical historic action movies. There are parodies of Red Cliff, Kung Fu Hustle, Kung Fu Panda, Titanic (Rose) and others. Your first hint of wackiness occurs in the opening credits when the screen shows ""in this movie"" followed by Jackie Chan, Stephan Chow, Zhang, Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat, Maggie Cheung & Angelina Jolie. And you're going ""Whoa"" what a cast. Except, this disclaimer ""All refused to be"" begins to magically appear in front of ""in this movie"". The next indicator is a little too ethereal scene of an attractive immortal fairy, Rose (Titanic spoof?) poling a raft in an idyllic marsh being waylaid by the thief Quig Yi Se. In the next scene he's robbing her but now they're suddenly in a desert. Rose is on Earth looking for love which ends up to be chasing the wary Quig. They happen upon a Pandora's Box which transports them to the Three Kingdoms Era and the battle of Red Cliff. In the process Quig is transformed into the general Zhao Yun and is captured by Cao. Zhao (Quig) soon sides with the adversarial camp of Liu Bei and is assigned to guard the attractive female Turkestan Ambassador who turns out to be, of course, the disguised fairy Rose. There are also spoofs and allusions to ""A Chinese Odyssey""; the monkey king tales and other, more contemporary, humor such as a hastily built bamboo version of the Olympics Beijing ""Bird's Nest""stadium; the current economic subprime meltdown; porn; Bollywood dancing; a Guquin type stringed zither that transforms into an electric rock guitar, hip-hop dance; shopping malls and, of course, Pres. Obama. Even spoofs of martial arts with the new smelly feet and peeing babies techniques.

Minus one star for a lack of English subtitles for names displayed during the movie and in interviews and filming extras. If an English speaking audience is expected to help support a movie then a bit of attention should be paid to helping them appreciate the fine points in making the movie and nuances of Chinese history.",1285545600,3,2046,4.8125
