8599846,5,B00E0NK0XK,"Is there any singular substance that has influenced Western culture more than LSD?  Sadly, the story of LSD has thus far been a tragic one, but with new research at some of the leading medical universities in the USA, perhaps this phenomenal gift will make a resurgence and become readily available once again - it is too beneficial for just the most ill.  This DVD covers the entire history of LSD, including original footage of government and psychological experiments with the substance.  If you are interested in learning more about LSD, this DVD would be a good place to start.",1428537600,,582,4.8
8599847,5,B00E0NK0XK,"so I choose to give this documentary a 5 star was because I thought it was pretty cool , so yeah on many levels I am bound by my own biases but regardless of this or that , I believe its important that people don't do drugs , but I believe that people have to accurate information about what they are putting into their bodies if they do decide to go that route .
  Its funny that these substances , at one point in time played a critical part in the counter culture revolution in the 1960's as well as the anti-war movement , as well as many other parts of the human culture , but I can only hope that someday these things can be controlled and regulated in a mature way that respects human life and human freedom . I hope that  someday in the far future LSD and other psychedelics can be integrated into American Medical Culture .
  thank you Albert Hoffman",1400716800,2,859,4.181818181818182
