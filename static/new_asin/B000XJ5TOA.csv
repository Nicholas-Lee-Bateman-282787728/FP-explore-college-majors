3002486,5,B000XJ5TOA,"Ok so like, I was a huge fan of the Ben Stiller Show and Mr. Show and SNL was never as funny as when Odenkirk was active there.  So of course now I have ""Let's Go to Prison"" and now ""The Brothers Solomon"" in my collection.  Ironically, for both movies I wasn't too impressed with the first time I watched each.  But there's something about Odenkirk's movies that when you watch them the second time that you realize just how hilarious they are!  What's up with that?  Or is it just me?

Once I realized that this movie REALLY IS Dumb & Dumber part 3 the movie had me in stitches almost non-stop.  Coen and Farelly brothers beware, Odenkirk is on the prowl!  Rawr!  :D  McBride almost steals every scene hes' in in Odenkirk's flicks.  From eskimo kisses to a sobbing janitor I think McBride's roles are essential for the success of both films.  So far the combo of Odenkirk, Arenett and McBride has worked.  I wonder what awaits next from Odenkirk?

3002487,4,B000XJ5TOA,"Give this movie a shot.  It isn't over-the-top, you won't laugh until you fart and then spill popcorn in your lap.  The humor is mostly subtle, dry, honest, but at times, edgy.

At the core of this movie are two innocent, loveable and awkward brothers who would do anything to make their dying father happy.  Not to mention, it doesn't hurt to have two of the funniest actors currently working in the industry as the main characters.

So while it isn't entirely ""Dumb & Dumber"", it is almost as enjoyable.",1198627200,7,505,4.566666666666666
3002488,3,B000XJ5TOA,"The unequivocal epitome of absurdity, The Brothers Solomon is equal parts stunning hilarity and eyebrow-raising ridiculousness. With a mind-bogglingly offbeat sense of ""Dumb and Dumber"" humor, this film introduces such sustained socially-inept insanity by its unpredictably bizarre lead characters that it is constantly difficult to predict where it's all going. Despite the berserk brothers' insensibilities, this madcap farce manages to be entertaining and different from the recent slew of R-rated comedies.

When their father lapses into a coma and Dean (Will Forte) and John (Will Arnett) Solomon learn that his only regret was not seeing a grandchild, the two brothers determine to acquire one no matter what the cost. After the romantically (and socially) inept twosome fail at wooing a mate to bear their child, they turn to other means of conception...

Initially The Brothers Solomon appears to be an even wackier and more ludicrous version of ""Dumb and Dumber"", with a goofy duo of misfits who lack all cognitive thought processes. Early on, the film even steals a joke from the Farrelly Brothers' comedy, which is a huge mistake considering how widely recognized Harry and Lloyd's dialogue has become. But after the initial letdown, The Brother Solomon redeems itself with a nonstop barrage of hilariously awkward slapstick and unpredictable kookiness.

Like Steve and Doug Butabi from ""A Night at the Roxbury"", the Solomons never let their spirits down, as if they're completely oblivious to their unwieldy social shortcomings. Their chipper attitude remains constant, even when they disagree, and it casts a bizarre sense of satisfaction straight through to the moronic conclusion. To say that the events in the film are even remotely believable or sensible would be a gross exaggeration, yet one has to appreciate the inane degree of preposterousness the film achieves with its extremely over-the-top comedy.

From picking out a pornographic magazine at a sperm bank (they struggle over a copy of Indigenous Weekly), to a candlelit hallway dinner, to ""kickass"" parenting training involving hiding and mistreating baby dolls, to stalking children at a playground, the absurd gimmicks and slapstick the brothers employ is surprisingly entertaining. The entire film tests the limits to which imbecilic comedy can be pushed, and once that line is crossed, they continue forward into unknown territories of illogicality. Puppetry-based sex training and friendship-simulation aside, The Brothers Solomon is utterly pointless and largely trivial, and yet somehow the all new lows of intelligence make for an unusually high amount of laughs.

Reaching unforeseen heights in creative absurdity and comedic eccentricity, The Brothers Solomon appears uninhibited by stereotypical comedy output. The humor on display is a seldom seen blend of disturbing mockery and playful stupidity that is ultimately hit or miss. But when it succeeds, it does so with masterful relish creating simultaneous shock and laugh-out-loud silliness. Airplane banners, pedophilia, and infant abuse never looked so funny.

I wanted to see this movie because my childhood idol Lee Majors was in it as the father who lapses into a coma.  I loved the relationship between the brothers and the lengths that they are willing to go to give their father a grandchild.  Not the funniest movie I've ever seen,  but still worth seeing.  If you don't like it the first time you see it watch it again.  I found I liked it more the second and third time.

3002496,2,B000XJ5TOA,"Some films get absurd comedy right, and others fail, doomed to comedic mediocrity. In my opinion, this film is of the latter variety. If you want stupendous examples of recent absurd films, look no further than The World's End, The Hangover, This is the End, Super Troopers, ... the list goes on. Save yourself the time and the trouble and skip this one. My main issue was that the movie lacked originality: the awkward moments were all typical, the ending was predictable, and nothing about the movie was memorable. Will Forte's character was more or less the only saving grace (Arnett was a bit try hard). So yeah, there's a reason why this movie has a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes. Take heed!",1388966400,,689,4.655737704918033
3002497,5,B000XJ5TOA,"This movie is absolutely hilarious. There are comedic scenes that will make your jaw drop.

Arnett and Forte are delightfully looney, spooky misfits. They have ""madmen smiles"" accentuated with brilliantly white teeth. (Are they veneers or CGI ??) They seem to be wearing heavy makeup (much like the actors did in the old Technicolor days) and they resemble manic mannequins or life-sized dolls.

I was watching this on a treadmill and several of the scenes made me almost fall off!! The dating misadventures were great. But 2 scenes in particular approached comedic genius: the adoption agency scene, and the hot tub scene.  These guys are sick puppies, but they're only saying and doing what all guys want to say and do but can't.........

I highly, highly recommend this vastly underrated movie.",1378080000,,797,5.061068702290076
3002498,4,B000XJ5TOA,A really funny move. Its not Will Arnett's finest but is it is still a movie with a ton of big laughs in it.,1377129600,,108,3.5416666666666665
3002499,3,B000XJ5TOA,This movie started really clumsy and slow and is really stupid funny all the way through. I didn't like the racial jokes with the black janitor they kind of almost ruined the movie for me. Also will arnett shouldn't smile so big all the time he looks scary and super creepy when he does that not happy. Kristen Wiig is great as a straight woman in this performance this  time around. She adds a lot of deepness to the movie. Their were a lot of awwwwwwwwwwww moments and quite a lot more wtf moments kind of like the hangover and jim carreys old movies. Esp funny when they were trying to deal with the poop and popcorn. I liked that the brothers cared so much about their dad  they would try to make his wish come true and the length they go through to show the couple who is helping them make this dream come true that they are able to handle the responsibilties that go with the decision. Like that they used one of those blimp messages guys use to propose to get a point across and they argued and told jokes in the message.,1374451200,,1028,4.239795918367347
3002500,4,B000XJ5TOA,"This mocks the ""can do"" attitude of optimistic losers everywhere.  Two nerdy brothers drag into a hospital too late to speak with their dad Lee Majors before he slips into a coma. The doctor reports having a grandchild was the dad's great wish and could give him a reason to live.  Hilarious schemes to make a baby are pursued at a frantic pace often with a comatose bearded Lee as a comedic prop.",1369699200,,397,4.424657534246576

3002503,5,B000XJ5TOA,This movie is f-ing hilarious!  Such a weird abstract humor... I loved it. Definitely for goof-balls and quirky eccentrics. The brothers solomon is a great film.,1329782400,,161,5.1923076923076925
3002504,1,B000XJ5TOA,"This movie is as bad as it can be. Script, director of the movie and actors are not qualified for a movie release. It was horrible. Waste of time.",1262304000,,146,4.068965517241379
3002505,1,B000XJ5TOA,"In THE BROTHERS SOLOMON, John (Will Forte) and Dean (Will Arnett) are two siblings brought up isolated in the Arctic by their widower father (Lee Majors). Returning to civilization as adults, they are baffled by the dating scene. Hilarity is meant to ensue when their father lapses into a coma and they decide to fulfill his dream of a grandchild before it is too late. Unfortunately, THE BROTHERS SOLOMON is one of the most notable bombs of the last few years, and you're unlikely to find it a worthwhile experience.

The camaradery between the two brothers is similar to DUMB AND DUMBER, but laughs are even fewer. The maturity level here is so low--among the sparse gags is a lot of bathroom humour--that one might believe this film intended for a less than adult audience, but any plot where artificial insemination has a key doesn't seem likely to target a young demographic. I got this movie because I enjoyed Will Arnett's work on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT and in an infamous Human Giant sketch where he plays a hyperbolic pervert ultimately killed by a sex machine. His acting here is similar to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, and may not be all that great, but he's so much better than Will Forte, one of the most unversatile and unlikeable comedians ever cast on Saturday Night Live.

Just as the first film adaption of the Fantastic Four, the low-budget production of 1994, was made only to keep a hold on the rights and was never intended to be seen, I really wonder if THE BROTHERS SOLOMON was produced to give some secret boost to the parties involved even if it were a box office flop.",1259539200,,1586,4.681003584229391
3002506,2,B000XJ5TOA,"Like most modern comedies, this film aims to be senseless, absurd and go for the easy laugh. This film stars 2 obnoxious characters who are blind to the fact they are losers. The writer was probably going for ""Dumb & Dumber"", but there's very little likable about them. 99% of the comedy comes from the fact they are pathetic and disturbing. It gets old quick. Arnett and Forte compliment eachother because they can both be mildly funny. But this script, written by Forte, just sucks.

I can only think of ONE funny, actually BRILLIANT, gag and you'll know what it is if you watch it. It happens very late in the movie. I'm disappointed that this was directed by Bob Odenkirk who is a very funny talent. Kudos to Kristen Wig as the competent straight woman to the two lame title characters.

Worth a watch to see how lame comedians are these days and for a few surprising laughs.",1250121600,,879,4.522012578616352
3002507,4,B000XJ5TOA,"Normally, I hate these types of comedies, finding them to be too stupid to sit through. I happened across this movie by chance earlier tonight, and something made me stop and watch it. There were a couple of times when I turned away, but I found myself turning back to it, and actually starting to care about what happened. I even found myself smiling at the end, which was unexpected! For a stupid, run-of-the-mill modern comedy, this was pretty good. It's not ever going to be on my list of favorites, but I would not be adverse to watching it again. Good for those times when I don't really want to think too hard about what I am watching, but I still want to feel good at the end of it.",1235174400,5,690,4.2748091603053435
3002508,3,B000XJ5TOA,Ever since Arrested Development I have appreciated Will Arnett so it was just a natural to add The Brothers Solomon to my collection of his work. It is an odd ball movie but as usual Arnett makes it happen.,1231286400,,206,4.3076923076923075

3002510,2,B000XJ5TOA,"Raised at the north pole by their father, these two are
just not girl-wise? None of the girls  they meet seems remotely human
either. Having a baby by a sperm implanted mother for a lot of money
seems an option when their father's last wish before he goes into a coma is
for grandchildren? Just so much of them not getting social conventions

3002512,5,B000XJ5TOA,"This is without a doubt, one of the funniest movies I've EVER seen! I literally laughed at everything. I started to laugh 'til I cried. I almost got to a point where my face hurt from laughing so much! John and Dean Solomon are dim-witted brothers who are not so good with the ladies. When they find out that their dad might be dying, they find out that their dad wants a grandson. They try to find a woman who will have their baby. Janine will have their baby, but she will be a surrogate mom. She tells them to learn how to be good dads, so they buy a doll and pretend it's a baby. It's hilarious the way they use it! John tries to hook up with Tara, but she always turns him down. Janine has an ex-boyfriend named James who is always around, but wants to help. James is extremely funny too! Later, it seems like Janine enjoys being around John and Dean. I loved how they try to find Janine when she runs away. I love when they are at the sperm bank. I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE! If you love comedy, I highly suggest THE BROTHERS SOLOMON!!!",1220745600,4,1050,4.177339901477833

I decided to watch this this one because I really enjoy Will Arnet, but there is absolutely nothing going for this movie. To compare this to ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a total assault on stupid comedy, that movie had laughs, all this one's got going for it, is the dull, dry thudding sounds of one joke after the other falling flat.

""The Brothers Solomon"" is one of those comedies that makes the viewer uncomfortable, and where a lot of the comedy comes from the discomfort.  The brothers aren't stupid, so much as hopelessly naive and socially inept to an extreme.  The discomfort, and the comedy, arises from these fish out of water trying to pursue their quest in the real world.  If you loved ""Titus,"" the UK version of ""The Office,"" or ""Arrested Development,"" you will likely enjoy this movie very much.  If not, you should probably save your money and rent or buy something else.",1213574400,,656,4.572649572649572

If they cut out the swearing, this would be a PG movie that even kid's would say was not funny. It has it's moments, a couple of small laughs, but the same stupidness over and over is irritating and annoying after a while.

Cheap jokes, cheap laughs and a lot of failed humor. It could have been so much better with better jokes in it, but it falls flat. Even there attempt for a tearfully happy ending didn't work either.

Rent it if your curious, trust me, you will wanna return it.

3002518,2,B000XJ5TOA,"This film is rated ""R"" ostensibly because of the off-color language, yet probably the only audience that would really see any comic value in it is the under-18 set, so it fails there. The gags are predictable and repetitious.  The best I can say about it is that the leads play nicely off each other and both have good camera presences and are oddly endearing. If the filmmakers had cleaned up the language and snagged a PG  or a PG-13 it would probably have fared better. It's not a bad film, just a brainless one.",1200528000,,515,4.410526315789474

3236992,4,B000XJ5TOA,"I wouldn't exactly compare this movie to Dumb and Dumber because I don't think the Solomon brothers are dumb just socially unsophisticated.  I wanted to see this movie because my childhood idol Lee Majors was in it as the father who lapses into a coma.  I loved the relationship between the brothers and the lengths that they are willing to go to give their father a grandchild.  Not the funniest movie I've ever seen,  but still worth seeing.  If you don't like it the first time you see it watch it again.  I found I liked it more the second and third time.  It's one of those movies that kind of grows on you, if you give it a chance.",1389657600,,637,4.258333333333334
3236993,2,B000XJ5TOA,"Some films get absurd comedy right, and others fail, doomed to comedic mediocrity. In my opinion, this film is of the latter variety. If you want stupendous examples of recent absurd films, look no further than The World's End, The Hangover, This is the End, Super Troopers, ... the list goes on. Save yourself the time and the trouble and skip this one. My main issue was that the movie lacked originality: the awkward moments were all typical, the ending was predictable, and nothing about the movie was memorable. Will Forte's character was more or less the only saving grace (Arnett was a bit try hard). So yeah, there's a reason why this movie has a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes. Take heed!",1388966400,,689,4.655737704918033
3236994,5,B000XJ5TOA,"This movie is absolutely hilarious. There are comedic scenes that will make your jaw drop.

Arnett and Forte are delightfully looney, spooky misfits. They have ""madmen smiles"" accentuated with brilliantly white teeth. (Are they veneers or CGI ??) They seem to be wearing heavy makeup (much like the actors did in the old Technicolor days) and they resemble manic mannequins or life-sized dolls.

I was watching this on a treadmill and several of the scenes made me almost fall off!! The dating misadventures were great. But 2 scenes in particular approached comedic genius: the adoption agency scene, and the hot tub scene.  These guys are sick puppies, but they're only saying and doing what all guys want to say and do but can't.........

I highly, highly recommend this vastly underrated movie.",1378080000,,797,5.061068702290076

3236996,3,B000XJ5TOA,This movie started really clumsy and slow and is really stupid funny all the way through. I didn't like the racial jokes with the black janitor they kind of almost ruined the movie for me. Also will arnett shouldn't smile so big all the time he looks scary and super creepy when he does that not happy. Kristen Wiig is great as a straight woman in this performance this  time around. She adds a lot of deepness to the movie. Their were a lot of awwwwwwwwwwww moments and quite a lot more wtf moments kind of like the hangover and jim carreys old movies. Esp funny when they were trying to deal with the poop and popcorn. I liked that the brothers cared so much about their dad  they would try to make his wish come true and the length they go through to show the couple who is helping them make this dream come true that they are able to handle the responsibilties that go with the decision. Like that they used one of those blimp messages guys use to propose to get a point across and they argued and told jokes in the message.,1374451200,,1028,4.239795918367347
3236997,4,B000XJ5TOA,"This mocks the ""can do"" attitude of optimistic losers everywhere.  Two nerdy brothers drag into a hospital too late to speak with their dad Lee Majors before he slips into a coma.

Hilarious schemes to make a baby are pursued at a frantic pace often with a comatose bearded Lee as a comedic prop.",1369699200,,397,4.424657534246576

3237001,1,B000XJ5TOA,"This movie is as bad as it can be. Script, director of the movie and actors are not qualified for a movie release. It was horrible. Waste of time.",1262304000,,146,4.068965517241379
3237002,1,B000XJ5TOA,"In THE BROTHERS SOLOMON, John (Will Forte) and Dean (Will Arnett) are two siblings brought up isolated in the Arctic by their widower father (Lee Majors). Returning to civilization as adults, they are baffled by the dating scene. Hilarity is meant to ensue when their father lapses into a coma and they decide to fulfill his dream of a grandchild before it is too late. Unfortunately, THE BROTHERS SOLOMON is one of the most notable bombs of the last few years, and you're unlikely to find it a worthwhile experience.

The camaradery between the two brothers is similar to DUMB AND DUMBER, but laughs are even fewer. The maturity level here is so low--among the sparse gags is a lot of bathroom humour--that one might believe this film intended for a less than adult audience, but any plot where artificial insemination has a key doesn't seem likely to target a young demographic. I got this movie because I enjoyed Will Arnett's work on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT and in an infamous Human Giant sketch where he plays a hyperbolic pervert ultimately killed by a sex machine. His acting here is similar to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, and may not be all that great, but he's so much better than Will Forte, one of the most unversatile and unlikeable comedians ever cast on Saturday Night Live.

Just as the first film adaption of the Fantastic Four, the low-budget production of 1994, was made only to keep a hold on the rights and was never intended to be seen, I really wonder if THE BROTHERS SOLOMON was produced to give some secret boost to the parties involved even if it were a box office flop.",1259539200,,1586,4.681003584229391
3237003,2,B000XJ5TOA,"Like most modern comedies, this film aims to be senseless, absurd and go for the easy laugh. This film stars 2 obnoxious characters who are blind to the fact they are losers. The writer was probably going for ""Dumb & Dumber"", but there's very little likable about them. 99% of the comedy comes from the fact they are pathetic and disturbing. It gets old quick. Arnett and Forte compliment eachother because they can both be mildly funny. But this script, written by Forte, just sucks.

I can only think of ONE funny, actually BRILLIANT, gag and you'll know what it is if you watch it. It happens very late in the movie. I'm disappointed that this was directed by Bob Odenkirk who is a very funny talent. Kudos to Kristen Wig as the competent straight woman to the two lame title characters.

Worth a watch to see how lame comedians are these days and for a few surprising laughs.",1250121600,,879,4.522012578616352
3237004,4,B000XJ5TOA,"Normally, I hate these types of comedies, finding them to be too stupid to sit through. I happened across this movie by chance earlier tonight, and something made me stop and watch it. There were a couple of times when I turned away, but I found myself turning back to it, and actually starting to care about what happened. I even found myself smiling at the end, which was unexpected! For a stupid, run-of-the-mill modern comedy, this was pretty good. It's not ever going to be on my list of favorites, but I would not be adverse to watching it again. Good for those times when I don't really want to think too hard about what I am watching, but I still want to feel good at the end of it.",1235174400,5,690,4.2748091603053435

just not girl-wise? None of the girls  they meet seems remotely human

seems an option when their father's last wish before he goes into a coma is
for grandchildren? Just so much of them not getting social conventions
or how to behave in public goes a long way?

I almost got to a point where my face hurt from laughing so much! John and Dean Solomon are dim-witted brothers who are not so good with the ladies. When they find out that their dad might be dying, they find out that their dad wants a grandson. They try to find a woman who will have their baby. Janine will have their baby, but she will be a surrogate mom. She tells them to learn how to be good dads, so they buy a doll and pretend it's a baby. It's hilarious the way they use it! John tries to hook up with Tara, but she always turns him down. Janine has an ex-boyfriend named James who is always around, but wants to help. James is extremely funny too! Later, it seems like Janine enjoys being around John and Dean. I loved how they try to find Janine when she runs away. I love when they are at the sperm bank. I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!

""The Brothers Solomon"" is one of those comedies that makes the viewer uncomfortable, and where a lot of the comedy comes from the discomfort.  The brothers aren't stupid, so much as hopelessly naive and socially inept to an extreme.  The discomfort, and the comedy, arises from these fish out of water trying to pursue their quest in the real world.  If you loved ""Titus,"" the UK version of ""The Office,"" or ""Arrested Development,"" you will likely enjoy this movie very much.  If not, you should probably save your money and rent or buy something else.",1213574400,,656,4.572649572649572

If they cut out the swearing, this would be a PG movie that even kid's would say was not funny. It has it's moments, a couple of small laughs, but the same stupidness over and over is irritating and annoying after a while.

Cheap jokes, cheap laughs and a lot of failed humor. It could have been so much better with better jokes in it, but it falls flat. Even there attempt for a tearfully happy ending didn't work either.

Rent it if your curious, trust me, you will wanna return it.

The gags are predictable and repetitious.  The best I can say about it is that the leads play nicely off each other and both have good camera presences and are oddly endearing. If the filmmakers had cleaned up the language and snagged a PG  or a PG-13 it would probably have fared better. It's not a bad film, just a brainless one.",1200528000,,515,4.410526315789474
