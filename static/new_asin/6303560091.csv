679741,4,6303560091,"This average movie is a mellow-drama concerning the dedication of a statue to that great man, Ethan Hoyt. His first wife, Hannah, played by Stankwyck is over 100 & starts talking to a young biographer. The movie flashes back to 1848. She is very young, falls in love with Ethan (Joel McCrea) & they run off together & get married. Pretty quickly we find out he's not really so great. She is however, a cut above most woman. Another man enters their life, Steely (Brian Donlevy) & he falls in love with Hannah. The movie is a bit ambiguous about their relationship. He's a no good con man but she seems to bring out the best in him. The years fly by & in the course of them Ethan & Hannah become separated & estranged. He thinks she is dead in a flood. She has twins he knows nothing about. Lots of soap opera type stuff. The point being of course that behind every great man is an equally great woman. She ends her life story & then does a strange things. She doesn't die. Well done by director William Wellman. Good make up job as Barbara Stanwyck ages almost 100 years.",1284681600,,1071,4.306930693069307

679743,3,6303560091,"William A. Wellman, during a career that began in the early 20's and ended in the late 50's, directed such masterpieces as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Track-of-the-Cat-Special-Collector-s-Editon/dp/B000BDH6E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Track of the Cat (Special Collector's Editon)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yellow-Sky/dp/B000EHSVWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yellow Sky</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battleground/dp/B0001FVE40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battleground</a>. He produced and directed THE GREAT MAN'S LADY during the winter of 1941-1942 with two stars of that period : Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck. The idea that the film should have conveyed is that there is always a great Lady behind every great Man.

Well, maybe yes, maybe no but one thing is clear in my mind : THE GREAT MAN'S LADY is not a good exemplification of that statement of belief. First of all, the movie should have lasted at least one hour longer in order to convince us that Joel McCrea was actually a great Man because in the four or five scenes in which he's got the chance to defend his convictions, he rather appears as a selfish and greedy man than as an example. Now, I admit that Barbara Stanwyck impersonates a woman with a strong character, that she followed her husband to the West in spite of the consent of her family, that she preferred not to tell her husband she was pregnant so that he won't stay home because of her (a little melodramatic, isn't it ?) and that, when he finally made it socially, she chose to stay silent and hide the fact that Joel McCrea was already married to her. Interesting behavior for sure but, in my opinion, a little too passive to deserve the applause demanded by THE GREAT MAN'S LADY. The film really deserves only two stars but Barbara Stanwyck deserves an extra star for her performance. She was 35 years old when she played the character of Hannah Sempler and she managed to impersonate a 17 years old girl as well as a 107 years old woman.

A DVD zone Wellman minor efforts.",1175990400,4,2161,5.687306501547988
679744,4,6303560091,"This film features Joel McCrea as the great man, and although the story revolves around the effects he had on Stanwyck's character's life, his part is surprisingly small. Brian Donlevy plays a gambler named Steely, a part that resembles Rhett Butler from Gone With the Wind. But the real star of the film is Barbara Stanwyck, whose own strength shines through her character.

This story is told in flashback. It revolves around Hanna Sampler's (Stanwyck) involvement with the man who started Hoyt City (McCrea). It is melodramatic with constant twists and turns, but it is done quite well. Stanwyck's old woman makeup is very well done except for the mouth which was too restricting and made her mouth look like Yoda's from Star Wars.

The film does not end the way one might expect it to, with the death of the old woman. Instead, there is a satisfying but different end which makes for a better film since it is not predictable.",1131062400,3,930,4.734567901234568
679745,5,6303560091,"I love Barbara Stanwyck.  This film, made in 1942, was one of her personal favorites.  Teamed with Joel McCrea (the Great Man, Ethan Hoyt), theirs is a collaboration that would last throughout 7 pictures together.

Told in flashback, we see a reporter (K.T. Stevens), interview Hannah (Stanwyck) who is 109 years old just as they are about to dedicate a statue of Ethan Hoyt (her husband).  We then go into the flashback mode to the year 1848 where we see Hannah as a spirited young girl.  The film depicts Hannah's life with Ethan, their pioneering stock (nobody plays a pioneer woman better than Stanwyck), the tragedies they encounter, their separation and ultimate reunion.

Stanwyck, of course as always is excellent and it has been said she should have received an Academy Award nomination for this picture.  I agree.

This film was one of her own personal favorites but at the time it was released, it was never very successful and it broke her heart.

This film is excellent in every way and will disappoint none of Stanwyck's admirers.",1091664000,19,1044,4.820224719101123

7850083,5,6303560091,"This is Barbara Stanwyck at her finest. In my opinion she deserved an Oscar for the way she transformed her character from a bright and bubbly young woman to an aging and dignified matron. I first saw this movie years ago on Turner Classic Movies. I have wanted to own it for quite some time, but couldn't find it for sale anywhere. Then, most recently, I found it on Amazon.com. It is a great movie about an enduring love, that lasted for decades despite the obstacles and misfortunes that befell the couple along the way.

7850086,5,6303560091,Well packaged; delivered quickly.  Just a terrific movie!  McCrea is absolutely wonderful.  Stanwyck is also terrific as well as Donlevy.  The three are a good acting trio.

7850087,2,6303560091,"""The Great Man's Lady"" is a 1942 black and white western melodrama that resembles ""Cimmaron"" (1931) -  a multi generational story about the building of the West, told from the POV of the surviving woman who stood behind the man who got credit for their achievements. In this case the woman is Barbara Stanwyck and the man is played by Joel McCrea.

Sultry Barbara Stanwyck (1907-90) made more than 80 films and was nominated 4 times for an Oscar (""Stella Dallas"", ""Ball of Fire"", ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sorry Wrong Number""). She won 3 Emmys (""The Barbara Stanwyck Show"", ""Big Valley""). AFI lists her as # 11 among the ""Top 100 Greatest Screen Legends"".

In this film she has to play a woman who ages between 16 and 100+ years, and despite her considerable talents, her performance at these extremes leaves much to be desired. But her acting in between is up to her usual high standards.

Joel McCrea (1905-90) had a long career starting in the silent film era, and appeared in more than 50 films, usually as a hero in westerns - ""Wells Fargo"" (1937), ""Union Pacific"" (1939), ""The Virginian"" (1946), and ""Four Faces West"" (1948). But McCrea wasn't limited to western films, and he gave good performances in films such as ""Foreign Correspondent"" (1940) and ""Sullivan's Travels"" (1941), although I think his best job was in ""Ride the High Country"" (1952).

FWIW - McCrea and Stanwyck made 6 films together, beginning in 1934 (""The Gambling Lady""). This was their last.

Brian Donley (1901-72) plays the third leg in the romance. Donlevy was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1939's ""Beau Geste"" as the sadistic Sergeant Markoff. He appeared in almost 100 films between 1923 and 1969, but his busiest period was the 40s when he did more than 30 films including ""Command Decision"" (1948), ""The Virginian"" (1946), ""Two Years Before the Mast"" (1946), and ""Hangmen Also Die"" (1943). He often played a villain, as he did in ""Union Pacific"" (1939) that co-starred McCrea and Stanwyck, but in this film he (rather than McCrea) is the hero.

William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman (1986-1975) directs. Wellman was nominated 4 times for an Oscar, winning for Best Writer in 1938 (""A Star is Born""). He was nominated for an Oscar and a DGA for ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954). Among his notable films were ""Wings"" (1927), ""Public Enemy"" (1931), ""Beau Geste"" (1939), ""The Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), and ""Battleground"" (1949).

1942 was a good year in films - ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" and ""Mrs. Miniver"" were the clear Oscar winners and at the box office. Other popular films included ""Casablanca"", ""Woman of the Year"", Alan Ladd's ""This Gun for Hire"", Gary Cooper's ""Pride of the Yankees"",  and ""Road to Morocco""

The NY Times called the film ""a sentimental journey"" that ""doesn't reveal much cause for pride"" and criticized the ""poor script"". Variety called it a ""tedious story of the pioneering west.""

If you like the idea of multi-generational films of the West, you're better off with Cimmaron"" (1931) or ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962).",1337299200,,3025,4.87719298245614
