1996183,5,B0001FR3JA,"Purchased the CDs when they were released----and they remained in my stereo for at least six months. Rostropovich's interpretation is simply beyond words...so imagine my surprise over 10 years later, taking cello lessons. My cello teacher loaned me a couple of cello DVDs---we wondered aloud if Rostropovich filmed his monumental recording. It would be understatement in the extreme to say how delighted I was when I found he did. These DVDs are even better than the CD recordings, for the artist described each piece in detail. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1214784000,,548,5.238636363636363
1996184,4,B0001FR3JA,I have a Sony upconverting dvd player and there is a strange purple hue when the upconversion is enabled.  I have experienced the same effect using the component outputs on another dvd player.  It makes it basically unwatchable.  It looks normal without upconversion or over svideo.  It's upsetting for such a fine dvd.  It would be 5 stars otherwise.,1169424000,,351,4.88135593220339
1996185,4,B0001FR3JA,"If you study cello, or enjoy solo cello, this is great. This is unique, and can't be found elsewhere.

My complaint is the video taping technique and quality. It had dropouts, indicating it was either filmed or analog-taped. Some close-ups are not necessary and not steady, other times the person is too small. Guess the cameraman felt he had to do something. And the result is annoying. My opinion is that it is best not to do anything and just let the camera roll. Shame on the camera crew.

Despite the video drawbacks, the content is highly valuable, especially if you are a cellist.",1168300800,,587,4.634615384615385
1996186,5,B0001FR3JA,"This is a  breathtaking DVD. While the playing is scintillating, I was struck by Slava's remarks about the music. It is so illuminating to hear him speak about the energy in the phrase and demonstrate on the piano. This a disc for all the senses not just the ears and eyes. Not since Casals have we had such wonderful marriage of musicianship and scholarship in one package. Bravo!",1167955200,,381,4.602941176470588
1996187,5,B0001FR3JA,"I saw Rostropovich perform all six suites in Vienna during the mid-70s at the time he initially moved to the west. It was the first time he performed all six in one sitting. I also met the man after the concert, truly one of the greatest musical evenings I ever experienced. This man, a giant of his craft, makes these suites ""sing"". The recording was made inside a cathedral and to my eyes and ears, gets the visual and aural tone just right. These pieces are arguable at the apex of western music. The soloist quality of the performance is also an excellent entry point for anyone, particularly those with a jazz background, who want to ""get into"" classical music. ""Slava"" is at the top of his game in these recordings. A total must have for any DVD collection. Next stop: check out Rostropovich's CD interpretation of the Britten suites or Jacqueline DuPre's DVD of the Elgar Concerto. Cello heaven!!",1146182400,,903,4.65
1996188,5,B0001FR3JA,"I really don't know what to say about this DVD set. It is by far the wisest purchase I have made all year. I won't repeat anything that has already been stated, but this is so definitive, so incredible, so informative that it will leave anyone stunned and in need of some alone time with your Cello or Piano or Violin, take your pick.

The sound quality is superb. I listened to it with the DTS for enhanced quality, while there was also a choice of Dolby Digital Surround Sound and PCM 2.0 (default) for regular TV sets. Listening to Rostropovich talk about about Bach (in subtitles) was incredibly engrossing. I had to watch the entire set twice, to make sure I wasn't imaging how good this was. It was like taking a music history / theory class directly from Rostropovich himself.

I'm completely sold on Rostropovich and his philosophy with Bach and the interpretations. You'll see why.",1133568000,,890,4.6265822784810124
1996189,5,B0001FR3JA,"The insistent longevity of these Suites is powerful no matter who plays them. I beleive you need to see them being performed in that this induces another dimension of contemplation, for there has been a large range of interpretations from the inital Casals. I prefer Pierre Fournier, he simply has the right tempi, and  not so rhapsodic as Casals and Rostropovich who follows him. Although Rostropovich is my second preference,he seems to bring a bit more discipline to these Suites than Casals. And then Janos Starker,but this is in the end useless for we are speaking of different voices rendering a ""voice"" of Bach. There is also a fascinating dimension on an interpretation that has a more metallic timbre as Moshe Maisky,quite rich in timbre, than the original gut strings of Casals.
But Rostropovich as well soars to new heights especially in the E-Flat Fourth Suite. He adds well- thought through structural analysis and odd bits of historical information on these Suites,works that he regarded as the highest form of musical expression. There is a scheme to the keys of these Suites he says in his introductory remarks. The First Suite in G Major is the most positive ""youthful"" he calls it then the lamenting power of D-minor has a shadow over the entire history of music. This is resolved again with the Third Suite in the more positive C Major follwoed by another major key of E-Flat in the Fourth Suite, Then the real weight of these Suites resides in the Fifth C Minor,the most memorable moments and the hopeful again Sixth in D Major written for a Five-String Violoncello. The ""Preludes"" we learn here in each Suite has the weights required the foundations in structure and shape.
You see him then playing these Suites here within a cathedral Basilique Sainte Madeleine,Vezelay Yonne,France with perceptive cutting to and from away side shots,frontal and aerial isolated within a nook with adequete Christian images,solid white statutes of saints. The place was selected for the simple shapes,lines and rhythms of the archetecture the wall graphics in stone, shapes that Rostropovich felt the same strength of dignity as these Suites. I found this cutting away actually distracting,and I tend to think that these works transcend any frame of association with Christian icons and faith,Bach was Protestant. His use of the Sarabande is one glaring example, originally the Sarabande was the tune of the street for those of ill-repute, and one could have been incarcerated for playing a Sarabande in its original form from Spain. Well by the time the form came to Germany it was already purged of its murky past. But hardly the place of saints. These Suites if they have any meaning at all must transcend time and ideology, it is their overwhelming resonances not having specific associations.
Rostropovich you may find his timbre somewhat gruff and hard edged at times especially when the phrase is punctuated, at the end on a lower string, Sometimes it is here rendered as a ""noise"",and ""noises"" do have functions within this context, ""ugly"" timbres are permissibale within these Six essays on humanity, the human condition, the spirit, yet I don't prefer these dead tones Rostropovich renders especially within his playing of the Fifth Suite C Minor where the lower C open and g open is utilized more frequently. There are also many moments where he creates unimaginable tension by not giving in to increasing the volume of the tone. He plays these works on a full-size violoncello.

As I said the E-flat Suite he brings a focused interpretation especially the opening that could get tedious under the wrong hands with its continuous moving eighth notes,quavers,and semi-quavers. He discusses the ""time"" of these Suites, how they move in a strict motion, a reduction to what the pulse is, quavers or semi-quavers(eigtht notes and sixteenths).How whatever is established comes to be disrupted with cadenza-like gestures, as in the Fourth Suite ""prelude"" The balance of time is here discussed as well as the motion from strict business,heavier motions as ""allemandes""and ""preludes"",music that needs to establish the frame to flights of indulgent rhythms.lighter means and materials as ""bourees"",minuets"", gavottes""""gigues"", ""courantes"" runnings. Although even there Bach shines no light on each moment ""pulling back"" into minor keys reducing their timbre to whispers as in the First Suite ""Menuet""( I, II, I) (G major to G minor) in these Menuets""it was like a turning the voice backwards, a ""sotto voce"" yet a turning of the planar perspective as well, as space.",1104796800,,4574,5.089214380825566
8011850,4,B0001FR3JA,"A very enjoyable program. However, the item I received had the same three suites (1-3) on each of the two DVDs. I am returning the item and purchasing a replacement.",1503619200,,165,4.533333333333333
8011851,4,B0001FR3JA,"Beautiful performances, but for my purposes, a total 'FAIL' [as the kids say] as a listening experience with the otherwise interesting and thoughtful but lengthy introductions by Rostropovich interrupting each piece. I have a Cantatas dvd that also does this and I never play it as a result. Would have preferred them placed all together at the beginning or end of the set, or with a digital feature option to play all performances or all lectures separately. Oh well, still worth owning, but may not have purchased had I known that.",1481846400,,533,4.868131868131868
8011852,5,B0001FR3JA,"I'm neither a professional musician nor a Bach expert. Writing as a simple enthusiast of cello music, I can state unequivocally that this is the finest recording of Bach's cello suites that I've ever heard. I know that many consider Casals to be the standard, and it's hard to argue with that view. For my ear, however, Rostropovich has no equal. I would have been thrilled had this been merely an audio recording, but the added bonus of being able to watch the maestro perform and to hear his expert commentary before each suite is extraordinary. I'm extremely happy with this DVD - a great value from MovieMars.",1475798400,,613,4.685185185185185
8011853,5,B0001FR3JA,"My most recent purchase of this DVD was a gift for a friend, but I already own a copy; and the Bach Unaccompanied Cello Suites are for me a map of my inner landscape or the shape and sound of my own thinking and feeling. Rostropovich's performances are, as could be expected, among the very best, ranking with those by Pablo Casals or Janos Starker. This DVD version allows the added pleasure of watching Rostropovich as he engages with the music. Highly recommended.

My most recent purchase of this DVD was as a gift for a friend. I already own both the CD and DVD versions. Bach's Suites for Unaccompanied Cello are for me like maps of my own inner life, or incarnations of the elusive shapes of thinking and feeling. The DVD version allows the added pleasure of watching Rostropovich as he engages with the music and brings it to life. Watch this if you want to begin to know what music is about.",1434672000,,900,4.454545454545454

8011856,5,B0001FR3JA,"I can only second other laudatory comments here.  Rostropovich was the greatest cellist of all time; and wile I do prefer certain other cellists to him in these works (and even his live accounts from Prague on Supraphon from almost 40 years earlier, despite an inferior instrument there), his interpretations necessarily command attention from every lover of Bach and cello music for his unique insights, and it is a special privilege to have them preserved on video.",1428019200,,467,5.064935064935065

8011859,5,B0001FR3JA,This is a fantastic CD especially if you are learning to play the cello as you can learn a lot of technique from watching this. This CD has made a huge impact on both my husband and sister-in-law. Worth every penny.,1286496000,,215,4.2682926829268295
