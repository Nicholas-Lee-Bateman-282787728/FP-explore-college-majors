There are 3 things I particularly like about this DVD, Number  1 are the options, you can choose to do the full sequence or alternatively you can pick and choose shorter portions if you are tight on time. Number 2 is there are 2 individuals to follow, one who is super human and inspirational and the other who is slightly less strong and easier to mirror. Reason 3 it is narrated by Larry and not by someone who is actually trying to do the poses at the same time.  I found his directions and explanations very easy to follow, at certain points he would go back over some of the more complex poses with step by step explanation which was very useful.  Overall, buy it, use it and keep the Rocket alive!!!",1337644800,7,954,4.288888888888889
8396905,5,B003H8XQSU,"Great dvd! No frills or fancy production. Filmed in a yoga studio with Larry Schultz talking 2 students through the Rocket style vinyasa. The 2 students are a mix of a female and a normal size male (Not a typical stick figure yoga guy), which I really appreciated. The students were at different levels within their practice which was nice to see (Not everybody starts yoga being super flexible, which discourages most people new to yoga.. The flow was well paced and easy to follow. It is by no means a beginners dvd, but with dedicated practice you will grow with this dvd. Beautiful flow! No dvd like this.. I should know. I think I own every single yoga dvd out there =) You an see the Ashtanga influence behind the Rocket method. This dvd is a must have in any ones yoga dvd collection.",1322179200,6,791,4.462068965517242
