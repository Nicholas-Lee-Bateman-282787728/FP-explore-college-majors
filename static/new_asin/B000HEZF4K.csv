Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-a-Boy-Girl-Thing/dp/B0016QNSCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's a Boy Girl Thing,</a>&nbsp;this involves a surprise sex change for both. Here, though, the protagonists are pre-tweens - body issues pretty much end at ""Hey, it's not so hard to do this standing up."" That keeps it charmingly innocent.

The big tension is getting the two kids straightened out again, but side plots work well too: the misfit friend who finds his place, catty schoolyard rivalries, and the pressure of a mother try to live her dreams in her child. The two lead kids do a good job too, conveying the attempt to live the other's life but desperate not to let go of their own identities.

Parents will appreciate the lack of violence and adult themes, without giving over completely to saccharine inanity. This isn't the most memorable flick around, but a pleasant one anyway.

2777101,5,B000HEZF4K,"I saw this movie in the original German version, when my daughter Rosa was 8. Proudly she explained the plot to me, making sure she already was ""knowing"".  > By accidental wizardry a boy and a girl change their bodies, but not their mind. The girls mother desperstedly wants her daughter to be trained for swimming championship while the boy comes from an artist's family, where his dreaming and fantasy are encoureged. They both find out, that they have only few hours left to change back to their original bodies (and life!)They manage to coordinate their personal abilities, overcome their prejudices and find the old hobo-wizard in charge for the key to turn the spell back. A fantastic comedy not to be recommended for rednecks and bible-belters because of its freshness. The movie is made with lots of love, respect on sense of humour.

2777102,5,B000HEZF4K,"Kid friendly, fun, charming, light-hearted and watchable.  A really nice surprise, I'm glad I stumbled upon it.",1432252800,,111,5.529411764705882
2777103,4,B000HEZF4K,"I enjoyed this movie.  When I started watching it this time, I had forgotten that I had seen it before; but I liked it enough to enjoy it again.  The plot is interesting.  The dubbing is not great; but it is acceptable.  The dialog is pretty good and the voices match the ages and genders of the people pretty well. The major characters are fairly complex but some of the other characters are general types.  The acting is quite good.  This is a family movie with no bad language or sexual content.  The gender changing is innocently done and there are lessons learned while the viewer is entertained.  I would recommend it for family viewing.  Children will enjoy it and so will adults who like a good story.",1431993600,3,709,4.4765625
2777104,5,B000HEZF4K,"This is a charming comedy/fantasy, with a nicely intertwined multi-plot and a bunch of genuine laugh-out-loud moments.  The writing, direction, and acting is excellent, which makes the whole story as engaging as real life.  Remarkably, the magical aspects are well handled without resorting to big-budget special effects or CGI -- which just goes to show that you can't beat a plain old good story!  Although kid-oriented, adults will also find plenty to enjoy.  Parents who may be worried about the basic premise can relax:  this movie never strays into bad taste.",1430611200,,565,5.164835164835165

2777107,1,B000HEZF4K,"First, it's a poorly done production in any critical sense, just from the perspective of movie productions.

The story line is even worse.  It's not kid friendly unless you are trying to indoctrinate your child into a homosexual lifestyle, sex-change agreement and consent and/or encourage homosexual behavior.

I don't share any of those views and stopped this movie early on.  It is NOT in the style of Freaky Friday.  It is not a kid show unless you seek to change your child from what he/she was created.",1419206400,4,508,4.793103448275862

2777110,5,B000HEZF4K,"This is a fun and feel-good movie that can help kids respect and perhaps understand a little more about the different pressures boys and girls must face.  Although both genders share in one humanity, their experience and ways of relating are often quite different.  This film handled a difficult topic with fineness, insight and sensitivity while remaining classy and tasteful.",1409961600,,377,5.266666666666667
2777111,4,B000HEZF4K,"it was a little slow and boring at times, as if the script were not enough to fill a whole movie. Maybe they should have made it into a TV show.  But I don't regret watching it. Generally i really hate Vanguard movies, but since I love movies like Vice Versa and Freaky Friday, I decided to give this one a shot.  of course this isn't as good as the others, but it's pleasant enough.  I agree with someone who said that the dubbing was pretty bad, but I prefer that to subtitles.  I wish someone would re-make this with a slightly better script.

I gotta say, this movie does NOT ""encourage sex change"", as someone suggested. That's ridiculous!! LOL",1406332800,,649,4.375
2777112,5,B000HEZF4K,"This is a fun movie using the body-switching scenario which has been done many times but with a couple of major twists.
The first twist is that the two individuals who switch are not only not related but one is a boy and the other is a girl. The general theme in most body-switching movies is that each one envies the other, believing that the other has an easy life, but by switching bodies they learn about the other's life. That is not the case in this movie. These two go to school together and sometimes play together, more or less as rivals, but there is no indication of envy. They do learn a lot about each other while switched and working together trying to switch back, but they do not really learn a big life lesson.
The second twist is that this movie is really more about the magic which changed them. The girl's best friend is a ""want-a-be"" wizard who finds a book of magic which he is able to translate enough to tell the switching spell to the girl. She accidentally uses the spell to switch bodies with the boy, but the real wizard finds and takes back the book of magic before the ""want-a-be"" wizard is able to translate the reversal spell. The want-a-be wizard and the two who switched bodies must work together to track down the real wizard before time runs out to reverse the spell.
The plot is further complicated by another girl who learns of the switch and would personally gain in an upcoming sporting event if the two who switched bodies remaining switched and therefore works at preventing them from switching back.
A couple of other note worthy things: The complications of being switched supply most of the comedy in the movie. There is one brief nude scene, while in the boy's body the girl learns to pee standing up. Her (or his) bare buttocks is seen for about a second as she pulls up her pants.",1397606400,6,1828,4.443452380952381

2777115,2,B000HEZF4K,"This movie was originally in German.  Had they included English subtitles, it would be a bit more viewable.  However, I cannot stand dubbed movies because the actors speak and then five seconds later their ""dubbed voice"" kicks in.  On top of this, the plot is strictly intended for preteens.  It appears to be a film based upon some children's book, hence the plot.  I did manage to get midway through this film before I decided that it insulted my intelligence and I abandoned it altogether.  So I haven't a clue as to its ending.  But the plot was so predictable, one shouldn't wonder about its outcome.",1392163200,6,605,4.650943396226415

All I could remember was that it was a foreign movie, and I am so happy to have found it againn. Its a cute for the kids, like I said. Some other reviewer already said what the movie was about so I won't go there.

Its bascially a body swap movie, like freaky friday but a boy and girl instead of a mom and the daughter. I enjoyed, but some people might not. Each to their own you know.",1369008000,3,518,3.8411214953271027
