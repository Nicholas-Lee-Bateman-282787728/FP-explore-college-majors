The returns policy indicates that since the DVD is out of the wrapping and there was nothing wrong with the DVD (appart from some conviently place 'DAVE MATHEWS' in bold on the front cover) then I would get a reduced refund.  Combined with this the fact I live in Australia would mean the eventual refund would be 3/10 of bugger all.",1160179200,,775,4.398601398601398
