8603617,5,B00EBRWWG8,"I really wish i could give this more than 5 stars! It's THAT good. I love intense workouts and have tons of workout DVDs; mainly Beachbody ones. But over two years ago, I added Barre workouts in. But i would do one of my Barre DVD's, and pause it for a ""cardio break"" to spike my heart rate and really start sweating. I don't have to do that with this series! Wait, I DO have to pause but it's to catch my breath and get a sip of water: THEY DO NOT STOP! The owner, Darby, is in such awesome shape i almost think she's a robot (that's a compliment).

I have no real complaints about the series but I will say this: I don't love Bikini Bootcamp. I'm just not a fan of punching the air and can never get my heart rate up doing it. And this: AT TIMES, the instructors are working so hard, they forget to properly cue right or left. But seriously, who cares about that when you're getting a kick @@@ workout!?????

This is advanced.",1433548800,4,928,4.121546961325967
8603618,4,B00EBRWWG8,"All I can say is that I am humbled by these workouts.  They are more cardio based than the first Dream Body series and you definitely need to wear supportive shoes for the workouts.

True to Fusion Fitness style, the pace of these workouts is frantic.  I love the energy of this pace, but some may find it tough to take. Also, there is no warm up. Since I work out at 5 am, I do some light cardio before attempting these workouts.

Why I love these workouts:

*They are tough!

*There is no down time.  You keep moving from one exercise to the next.  Well, I should say that the workout crew is doing that, I'm using gasping for air and wandering around trying to find the next piece of equipment.

* The instructor fitness and nutrition tips that come with each workout.

* Workout versatility.  You can do the entire workout, or just do the cardio or toning separately.

* The no music option.  I am breathing so hard that I don't even notice the music, but it is nice to have that option so you can play your own music if you prefer.

Some things to note about these workouts:

* No real warm-up, so you might want to do some light cardio before doing these.

* No mirror cuing. I just pretend it is mirror cuing so I can work the same side.

* The instructors don't do all the reps, they jump in after talking and they are usually off beat from what the two background exercisers are doing.  This can be quite distracting, so I've learned to keep my eye on the background exercisers.

I enjoy these workouts, so these things to note don't annoy me a lot.  I also find I use these workouts as one-off ones and not so much all together in a rotation since for me, this leads to over training.

DISC 1: M.I.L.F. - aka Max Interval Laced with Fusion, with Darby (60 minutes)

Equipment needed:  2 pound weights, light resistance band, paper plates.

Oh my - this is one tough workout.  I thought Beachbody's Insanity workouts were the toughest ones out there, but this one is even tougher!  I think it's because you are not only doing cardio, but you are doing functional moves so your entire body is worked.  And all without impact!

The workout is broken down as follows:
30 minutes of cardio - with light weights.
25 minutes of toning - with focus on legs and abs
5 minutes of a well-deserved stretch.

DISC 2:  InTENse with Sadie (60 minutes)

Equipment needed:  1 or 2 pound weights, small playground ball, moderate resistance band, paper plates.

There are six ten minute segments alternating between cardio, arms and abs. I thought the first part of this workout was really, really tough.  So tough, there were many times that I was staring at the TV screen and saying some not nice things.  But, I loved it.  I love challenging my body.  Even the recovery moves were tough.

DISC 3:  BIKINI BOOTCAMP with Amy (57 minutes)

Equipment needed:  1 or 2 pound weights, green (moderate resistance) band

The workout breakdown:
* Bootcamp with the green band - 25 minutes
* Kickbox with light weights - 20 minutes
* Core - 10 minutes
* Stretch - 2 minutes.

The first time I did this workout, I really disliked it.  I found it hard to do the moves with the band since it kept slipping.  I also used a resistance tube instead of a band since I think it's safer.  The second time I did the workout, I was frustrated, but liked it a bit better.  I find it difficult to use the band while doing multi-joint moves.  It takes a lot of coordination, but you know what?  It's good for me to work on my coordination.

Why I am growing to like this workout:

* Your heart rate gets elevated without having to do high impact.  I love this!  My joints can no longer take the pounding, but I still love to do a tough workout.ith weights.

* Amy's instruction during the well-deserved stretch at the end.

Why I didn't care for this workout:

* For some reason, I just don't click with Amy as an instructor.  I find her more of a distraction than a help and I look will ignore her and look to the background exercisers to see what is going on.

* Amy will demonstrate a move, but it is for the wrong side and completely different tempo than what the background exercisers are doing.  This, combined with the frantic pace of the workouts, makes it tough to follow along.

* The modifier is on the right side, not on the left, like all the other workouts.

* The modifier rarely modifies.  It's as though she forgets she is the modifier.

DISC 4:  FUSION 50 with Brooke (50 minutes)

Equipment needed for this workout:
* 1 or 2 lb weights
* Green band (medium resistance)
* Paper plates
* Playground ball.

The workout breakdown:

Cardio #1 - 11 minutes

You do 11 different cardio exercises, while holding the light weights.  You do one side and then switch to the other side.

Cardio #2 - 12 minutes

You do 8 different cardio exercises, while holding the light weights.  You do one side and then switch to the other side.

Cardio #3 -6 minutes

You stand in a semi-squat while doing big arm circles.  You then do a prance with speed bag arms and then a down dog pushup.

Toning #1 - 6 minutes

You do 9 moves and then do the other side.

Toning #2 - 7 minutes

Focus on the core and triceps.

Toning #3 - 5 minutes

Ball under your back and you lift and lower your legs

Stretch - 2 minutes.

BATABARRE with Sadie (55 minutes)

Equipment needed for this workout:

* 1 or 2 pound weights
* Yellow band (light resistance)
* Playground ball
* Paper plates.

Workout sections:
Warm up - 4 minutes

Tabata - 23 minutes
Done with shoes

You do several rounds of 20 second tabata plus 10 second recovery.  You do one side and then the other.  I love the fact that the last few tabatas focus on the arms.  Who knew my heart rate could go through the roof by using tiny 1 pound weights and no impact?

Barre - 27 minutes
Done barefoot
Equipment:  Chair, playground ball, plate, 1 or 2 pound dumbbells

Standing Toning - 13 minutes
I love this fast paced barre work!  It reminds me of the Physique 57 workouts, which are some of my favorites.  The focus is on your inner thighs.

Floor work - 5 minutes.  Focus is on your outer thighs.

Abs - 5 minutes

Stretch - 4 minutes

This is my favorite of the Dream Body Series.  I don't think it's any easier, but I seem to enjoy it the most.  Perhaps it's because I'm getting more conditioned, after having done the first four workouts in this series.

If you are looking for some tough workouts that will really challenge you, you will like this series.  It may take some getting used to the frantic pace, but that is part of the energy of the workouts.",1407283200,3,6576,4.322368421052632
8603619,1,B00EBRWWG8,"I love this series! I bought the first series and loved it so much that I just could not help getting this one as well. These are tough! What I like about them all is that they are all so different and creative. Yes, the workouts are quite fast paced. I was a bit frustrated going through the first series because of this. I hit pause and rewind a lot. The transitions to the next exercises are very quick but after my first time through I was a bit more familiar with  the moves and the workouts are hard enough that you really won't mind missing a rep while you set up! All of this is true of this set as well. I know these are quite pricey but I have to say that the workouts are so very efficient in hitting your whole body and you will absolutely see results-super fast. I really look forward to my exercise sessions because these are really fun! Hard, but fun as well. I have a lot of dvd's and my favorites are these series and Tonique, which I own all of. You will work your tail off and feel wonderful when you are done. Promise! And you will look amazing! I highly, highly recommend getting these. You will not be disappointed!

11/9/13 Update...Okay, all of the high praise stated in my first review really goes toward the first dream body set. I got through this set and I have to say that I just don't care for this new set. I returned them. What I do not like about them is that the other instructors all seem to have put Darby's frantic spin on their workouts. My least favorite instructor is, in fact, Darby. She stresses me out! It seems like Darby sat down with the girls and said 'hey, lets make this series more my speed!' The first series is fast. But this one is just chaotic! Even the instructors mess up because it goes so fast. I feel pretty good after working out using the first series, however, after I was done with these I felt mentally drained and stressed the hell out! Not what I want to feel when I'm exercising! So, yes, I still recommend the first series. They are tough but creative and fun. This set...just not for me.",1382659200,15,2056,4.24234693877551
8603620,5,B00EBRWWG8,"I was so excited to when this new Cardio Series set came out from the Fusion Fitness gals because I love the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Body-Workout-Series-5-DVD-Set/dp/B00BACDFHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Body Workout Series 5 DVD Set</a>&nbsp;so much.  This new one is another winner, and even though I've only done each workout once, I know I'm going to love this set just as much as the first!

Unlike the first set, which comes with all five disks in one case, this comes in a box set, with five individual cases for the disks.  On the back of each individual case, there are some healthy eating tips from the instructor leading that workout, and the first workout (MILF) contains a small bookmark-sized paper that gives you an idea of how to rotate these into a workout schedule.  (See the end of my review for more information about using these.)

To do the workouts, you'll need the following equipment:

* one- or two-pound hand weights
* a small exercise ball like this one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Theragear-Pilates-Mini-Ball-Purple-9-Inch/dp/B000I1NJW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Theragear Pilates Mini Ball, Purple, 9 Inch</a>&nbsp;(I tried using my Physique 57 ball, but it was too large)
* a larger exercise/stability ball
* a firewalker-style band like these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Altus-Athletic-Altus-Fire-Walker-Loops-Circumference/dp/B0032HOOQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Altus Athletic Altus Fire Walker Loops Circumference</a>

* an exercise mat
* a chair

In the MILF workout, two of the women are using a high step, but the instructor Darby for that workout explains that you can use a wall, which is what I did.

The workouts are as follows:

* MILF with Darby - 60 minutes - The first thirty minutes are cardio intervals, where you cycle through interval circuits.  The second thirty minutes are toning moves.  This one really hits your legs, especially in one of the last few segments, where you use a wall or high step to target your hamstrings and glutes.

* InTENse with Sadie - 60 minutes - This one has a really good focus on the obliques and arms.  You alternate cardio, arms, and abs in ten-minute segments.

* Bikini Bootcamp with Amy - 60 minutes - Even though this has the same name as a workout from the first Workout Series, it's a brand new workout.  The first half-hour is cardio mixed with toning, where you use the toning band while doing cardio.  The second half is cardio-based kickboxing; while the gals held one-pound weights in this portion, I used my kickboxing gloves.  The final short segment is abs on a mat.  Although I usually love kickboxing, this one is my least favorite so far since the moves in the first half felt awkward to me.

* Fusion 50 with Brooke - 50 minutes - This one is similar in format to the Fusion workouts on the Workout Series.  The first 29 minutes are cardio and toning moves, and the last part is toning using a small exercise ball.  The first half of this felt super frantic to me, and I had a hard time positioning myself for some of the moves, but I hope that as I do it more, it'll get easier to follow.  There is also some great use of Gliding Disks in this one (it reminds me of the Horizontal Conditioning workouts, if you're familiar with those), and of the small ball (you use it behind the leg to do pulses).

* Bata Barre with Francie - 60 minutes - This one is actually broken into three segments.  For the first thirty minutes, you'll wear tennis shoes and do cardio tabata intervals.  After that, you'll take off your shoes, grab a chair or barre, and do about fifteen minutes of barre work, using the paper plates/Gliding Disks and a hand weight.  After that, you'll put away the barre or chair, and do floorwork, with a focus on legs, arms, and abs.  I love barre workouts, and love how this one incorporates the Gliding Disks.  It was really creative, and is one of my favorites from the set.

As with the first series, there is one instructor plus two background exercisers in each workout.  One of two background exercisers is modifying the workout.  Unfortunately, the modifier is not always on the same side in each of the five workouts, which can get confusing at times.

Although this is also billed as the Dream Body Cardio Series, I honestly don't see too much of a difference between it and the first Workout Series.  Each workout has a combo of both cardio and toning, and in pretty much every workout, you use a pair of one- or two-pound weights during many of the cardio moves.

That being said, I have to say I love how HARD these are and how creative the instructors are with the moves they use!  I never felt like I was doing a move that I had done in the first series; everything seemed very fresh and original.

Be warned, too, that this is definitely an advanced set!  I have about 350 DVD workouts in my collection, and the Dream Body ones are amongst the hardest I own.  I love, though, that I can grow into these more; I found with the first set that the more I do them, the more challenged I am since I know the moves better and can really focus on going deeper into the exercisers.

Two big differences between this new Cardio Series and the Workout Series is that this one has each workout shift gears about half-way through (so you can just do a half-hour workout) and there is also a music off option.

The two biggest negatives I see are this:

* there is still no mirror cueing on this set, which makes some of the workouts really frustrating

* some of the workouts feel even more frantic than those in the previous series; I'd definitely recommend checking out clips of these workouts on the Fusion Fitness website to make sure you'll like these before you purchase them

As far as results go, after doing just three of these workouts, I already started noticing a difference in my body.  Just as with the first series, this set gets quick results, and it really troubles women's problem areas, like the triceps, abs, glutes, and thighs.

I mentioned earlier in this review that the box set comes with a card about how to use these, but that card doesn't mention how to rotate them in with the first Workout Series.  Someone asked Fusion Fitness about this on their Facebook page yesterday, and here was their response:

 ""I'd start by alternating a cardio DVD (workouts with tennis shoes) with a toning DVD (without tennies) - something like this on a 7-day schedule: Day 1 Cardio DVD from new set. Day 2 Toning DVD from original set. Day 3 Cardio DVD from original set. Day 4: Your own workout - jogging/walking/running/swimming/hiking/etc. Day 5: Toning DVD from original Set. Day 6: Cardio DVD from new set. Day 7: Active rest day - you don't have to do a full-on workout but try and stay active and do a leisurely walk or playing outside with the kiddos/pets. If this is too much, just spread this out over 5 days and take two days off - take the stairs, park farther away in parking lots, etc. to stay active. Basically, however many days you want to workout, do this schedule alternating the cardios and tonings - you will have a lot of cardios to choose from and keep your body guessing! You can also throw in our original Dream Body DVD - it's a toning workout similar to Fusion Mix. I've also heard feedback from clients who purchase our prenatal DVD Fusion Bump as another to throw in the mix - it's still hard, don't worry! It's similar to Fusion Mix as well.""

Also, the disks are numbered differently on the cases from how they are listed/numbered on the back of the larger box.  Someone also asked them about this on Facebook, and they responded:  ""Go ahead and follow the DVD order, and the additional info in the MILF insert - doing your own workout between 3 and 4 and also using day 7 as an active rest day.""

My plan is to alternate these with the workouts from the first series, along with some Focus T25 workouts.

I know that this is an expensive set, so I hope that all these details have helped!

UPDATE ON 6-23-15:  I just wanted to pop back in to this review to say how amazingly effective these are for weight and fat loss.  I had taken a seven-month break from my Dream Body workouts, but just started adding this cardio series in these last two weeks. Just by adding in two or three of these each week, I've been able to bust through my weight plateau, most noticeably in my arms, waist, and legs.  These are TOUGH, but adding in a few a week will definitely help with weight loss.

UPDATE ON 11-28-15:  If you're looking for fusion-style workouts that are less intense, check out Linda Woolridge's Barlates Body Blitz workouts.  They're in a similar style as these, but are less frenetic, while still giving great results.",1375920000,20,9406,4.96109693877551
