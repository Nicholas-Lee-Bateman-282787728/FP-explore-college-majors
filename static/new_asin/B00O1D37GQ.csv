6701617,4,B00O1D37GQ,"I gave this 4 stars only because I haven't worked up to a 30 minute work-out yet, but I'm convinced this will be as great as the other WW CDs I've tried.",1423180800,,153,3.8125
6701618,3,B00O1D37GQ,I think it is a good work  its just not one of my favorites If you want to get a good workout this will do it.,1421712000,,110,3.230769230769231

6701620,3,B00O1D37GQ,"Due to recent foot surgery working out had to be discontinued for 6 months. The Weight Watchers DVD'S have been perfect for starting again. I am in my 50's and can no longer do the jumping excerises many workouts include(too hard on the feet and joints). While there are a couple of jumping excerises in the ""Burn"" work out they show you how to modify. These are not workouts for someone who is in good physical shape, or has been working out regularly. I really like the Watch Watchers Boot Camp DVD the best.",1419724800,25,510,4.4361702127659575
6701621,2,B00O1D37GQ,I exercise 45 mins to an hour daily and I found this dvd to be difficult.  I had a hard time doing the moves and keeping up. She just goes into the moves without explaining. The next day my back hurt too.  Not for me.,1475884800,4,217,3.8
6701622,4,B00O1D37GQ,I bought this at Target. I'm 240 pounds and I have rheumatoid arthritis. I find the beginner level appropriately challenging. It gets my HR above 140. I do have to modify the burpees and plank but I know I'll get there as I lose weight. I do this several times a week in addition to a strength training circuit. I only do the Burn workout. I prefer to do a different toning workout. I feel it's helping me. I dropped 3.4 pounds this week in addition to calorie counting.,1468454400,5,470,4.292134831460674
6701623,4,B00O1D37GQ,"Was hoping for a little more of a workout, but not bad.",1458259200,,55,3.6666666666666665
6701624,4,B00O1D37GQ,Very good video. This instructor is terrific. Not for the inexperienced but there are 3 levels to choose from.,1449532800,,110,4.842105263157895
6701625,4,B00O1D37GQ,Good workout,1448755200,,12,5.5
6701626,5,B00O1D37GQ,"Great workout!  I did the tone portion. 5 min warm up , 20min full body  compound moves using weights, 5 min stretch cool down. A great 30 mins!  Lots of variety and substitute moves for toning. If you cannot do lunges try squats,or lift your leg backward, or stand in place and lift your knees. The important thing to remember.... This is your work-out, you can substitute using a move that is good for your body. For the 2nd set (repeats the moves) I increased my weight to 8lbs each arm, because I knew the move. Or I didn't to the fast Sprint but walk in place....the goal is to move :-) you don't need a high intensity workout everyday.",1443916800,3,641,4.325
6701627,2,B00O1D37GQ,"I bought this on the strength of the positive reviews. Ultimately, I didn't like it. It's supposed to have a strength workout and a cardio workout. However, the strength workout incorporates a lot of cardio drills, and personally, I consider my strength routine to be a break from my cardio. In fact, there's so much cardio in the strength workout, that I thought it had been edited wrong. I also found some of the moves to be a little challenging for someone who's more than a few pounds overweight. As someone else said, there are a lot of lunges (including some rather deep ones) and squats: they're in the warm-up, the strength routine, and the cardio. I'm not sure why, but I also didn't find Lisa Wheeler to be particularly engaging. For a Weight Watchers video in particular, I was disappointed and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.",1440460800,,844,4.671140939597316
6701628,1,B00O1D37GQ,"I regret buying this.  The workouts are actually only 20 minutes if you don't include the warmup and cool down.  What is disgusting about the 20 minutes is that you repeat the same set of exercises TWICE.  With such a short workout, it should try to work different muscles with exercise variations, but you will be working the same set of muscles repeatedly with exercises that are not as effective as I've seen in other videos.  There are much better videos for losing weight.  Please don't make the same mistake that I did in buying this.  I wish somebody had warned me.",1439942400,3,572,4.5588235294117645

6701633,5,B00O1D37GQ,This video is great. Challenging for beginners and advanced exercisers. I am between the intermediate and advanced level and I am working hard & sweating. I use 5-10 pound weights and it pushes you. The instructor is motivating and explains the moves. I love that it is circuit training with moves that come from cross training as well. Cardio is easy to follow and works you out!,1431734400,7,380,4.686567164179104

6701639,1,B00O1D37GQ,"This exercise video is not appropriate for current Weight Watchers members.  The exercises involve a lot of lunges (which are very hard on the knees); very quick transitions between push ups (down on the floor) and then standing up lunges.  There is no instruction for the moves involved.  Also, very different from other Weight Watchers exercise videos, not one person in this video is overweight.  I would never recommend this product.  If you are interested, see if your local library carries it and view it first.

A much better choice would be ""The Older and Wiser Workout Video"".  All exercises there are designed to be off the floor and there is detailed instruction.  A much more pleasant exercise video.",1427155200,5,712,4.92436974789916
6701640,5,B00O1D37GQ,"Found this by accident at a local store, sorry amazon.com, but wow what a lovely surprise! The women in the video are attractive but represent different levels/body shapes which inspires but doesn't discourage. No Brittany/J Lo's to live up to here, nice as I'm middle aged and over all that. Main instructor Lisa is the true gem here. She is upbeat and the instructions are relatively easy, not a diva but great example of fitness without intimidating. Another bonus I realized only after watching other work outs on youtube is that the music isn't a distraction but helps you move along, the set is nice with soft colors that make it pleasant to watch. Will look forward to more of these productions,  it's been a long winter here in the Midwest and there are pounds to lose, areas to shape lol.",1426464000,8,797,4.652482269503546
8681440,5,B00O1D37GQ,"This can be really tough if you're not seasoned to working out. Only two sets per each group of exercises, but you'll sweat. If you're new to exercising or getting back into it. I really like the toning part. This also has a pick your level option beginner, intermediate and advance.",1525564800,2,283,4.568627450980392

8681448,5,B00O1D37GQ,"I found this dvd by chance at best buy (sorry amazon) for 3.99! I had recently bought a workout DVD that was TERRIBLE (Tracy Anderson Cardio Dance for Beginners)  so I was apprehensive to buy another. But hey... for the price, I figured what did I have to lose? Long story short this is a good DVD. I'd say while it does have the different levels of intensity, if you're the type of SUPER fit person who does insanity DVDs or Jillian Michael Shred type stuff.. it would probably be a little too easy for you. But if you're in okay shape but need some toning up and cardio help.. this is a good DVD. I sweat and definitely feel my heart pumping! My favorite part is the 30-minute burn portion.

As for the quality of DVD.. it was well organized, instructed, and choreographed so that you knew what to expect. Everything seemed professional and well put together (unlike the Tracy Anderson DVD.) I actually liked it so much that I just purchased (from Amazon! :)  ) The Weight Watchers 10 minute belly and thigh tone ups dvd. I can't wait to try it.",1485043200,2,1047,4.38659793814433
