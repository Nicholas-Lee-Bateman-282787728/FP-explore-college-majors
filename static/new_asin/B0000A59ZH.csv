1902430,5,B0000A59ZH,I found the movie very humorous and enjoyable. It is too bad it didn't get to the big screen. The interplay of the characters is great.,1082937600,2,135,4.230769230769231
1902431,2,B0000A59ZH,"This film is generally dreadful - with a simplistic plot, an obnoxious herione, and only one good laugh (it involves a Canadian Mountie).  Yet, as others have said, the saving grace is Michael Buble.  His singing is wonderful and he may have some potential as an actor.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't isolate its chapters so one could zoom from one Buble song to the next and skip this badly written film.",1079049600,9,407,4.704225352112676
1902432,4,B0000A59ZH,"This was a cute, light movie.  It made me laugh and had a fun plot.  If you want to watch a movie that makes you smile and is a little bit silly in the interim, Totally Blonde is the one for you.  Don't take it too seriously, though.  It's just plain fun.  And, HELLO!! Michael Buble has quite the voice and what a face...Frank Sinatra/Harry Connick, Jr./Bing Crosby mix.  Beautiful way to introduce himself to the world of music and movies.",1070755200,,441,4.382716049382716
1902433,5,B0000A59ZH,What a wonderful performance by Krista Allen and Michael Buble. Cleaverly written and directed by Andrew Van Slee.  A great way to bring Michael Buble's singing and acting together. This is a feel good romantic comedy. I wonder what Andrew will come up with next? Great job by all.,1069372800,2,281,4.73469387755102
1902434,1,B0000A59ZH,"Totally B movie with only one redeeming factor: Michael Buble's singing.
Buble's acting has some potential but it's his singing that's makes this dumb movie watchable.",1066003200,8,167,5.461538461538462
1902435,4,B0000A59ZH,"Though the title may suggest this movie is full of blonde stereotypes and jokes, the movie ends up being a romantic comedy that seems to forget the character of Meg Peters ""went blonde.""  Aft er the sequence under the opening credits, where Meg has just another one of those bad dates, she decides to dye her hair blonde to find Mr. Right.  However, after the initial shriek of excitement from her blonde friend, Liv, at the change, the issue is dropped.  Meg goes on a quest for Mr. Right, but her hair seems to have nothing to do with it.  Instead she gets wrapped up in other antics.  A confusing friendship with V-Club Owner Van and a roll-your-eyes at his stupidity one with pretty-boy Brad ensues.  Krista Allen is hilarious as Meg, a quirky but underneath it all good hearted and intelligent woman.  Her attempts at physical comedy are cute, not parallel to Lucille Ball, but still add a lot of fun and flavor to the film.  And personally, I think all women need a Wall of Blame!",1061424000,,986,4.5
1902466,4,B0000A59ZH,"This movie was made before Michael Buble became a household name.  Don't expect a great story, but if you are a Buble fan, its fun to see him act and surprisingly he did pretty good.  Story is predictable and been done before.",1353024000,,226,4.357142857142857
1902467,3,B0000A59ZH,"Bought this due to being a big fan of Michael Buble. My daughter has called this the worst movie she's ever seen, and she's seen her share. Maybe it's not the best of movies, but I've seen worse. I'm happy with it.",1330300800,,214,4.119047619047619
1902468,1,B0000A59ZH,"Wow.  If the Producer set out to make one of the most horrendous movies known to man, he did it.  Give 'em a Gold Star.

I like most movies I see.  But not this one.

Even though I had read some of the reviews, which were less than positive, I didn't think it could be that bad.  I'm a fan of soaps - Krista Allen (Days of Our Lives), Mauve Quinlan (Bold and the Beautiful, 90210) and Brody Hutzler (Young and the Restless, Days Of Our Lives) are actors that I've known of, and watched, for years.

But first and foremost, I am a fan of Michael Buble.  He is the reason why I decided to buy this movie and give it a shot.  I had never seen it on TV, I couldn't find a rental copy (after seeing it, I'm not surprised as no reputable rental establishment like Blockbuster would carry it).  So, I bought it.  He shows a bit of promise as an actor, although after seeing him perform this past summer, his passion is clearly music.

The only reason that I didn't turn this crap off within the first 10 minutes was because I knew that Michael had a fairly sizable role.

Do yourselves a favor and stay away from buying this movie.  It's not worth it.  Your time is more valuable that this - even if you sat on a rock, in a corner, twiddling your thumbs.",1288310400,,1247,4.1161825726141075
1902469,4,B0000A59ZH,"Yeah, its a silly movie...but its meant to be silly! I really liked it. I liked it so much I want to add it to my collection of dvds. Michael Buble is pretty cute in it and his acting isn't bad either...he's why I watched it in the first place. Also, the songs he sings are really good too. I say WATCH IT...you'll like it!",1283817600,,323,3.9846153846153847
1902470,5,B0000A59ZH,"I am like a few others and bought this because of Michael Buble'.  He is so sweet in this and although his control over his voice is much better now, the potential was there from the beginning. I will watch again.  I agree with one of the other reviewers, the canadian mountie scene was hysterical.  The movie is very predictable but is fun just the same.  If you are a Michael Buble' fan this is a must have.  I smiled through the whole thing.  Rita Weisburgh",1254009600,,460,4.290697674418604
1902471,5,B0000A59ZH,"Ok, I admit it, I'm a huge, huge, HUGE fan of Michael Buble, and that was the only reason I decided to sit down and watch this film. I have to tell ya, ok it's really chessy and corny, but in a funny sort of way.

Meg is tired of dating all the wrong guys so she decides to go blonde in the hopes that it will help. She ends up attracting the attention of the owner of the V Club, Van Martin played by talented Michael Buble. But she is actually in love with an old high school friend.

My heart goes out to Van in this silly yet fun movie. If I ever saw Meg, not the actress but the character herself, walking down the street, she better run. LOL!

There are alot of funny jokes. Michael is great at the different voices, that's my fave scene in the whole thing, and the IAG thing is too cute. My friends and I use it so much, it's sunken into our vocabulary now, in fact I have them saying it at work now too. LOL!",1169942400,,916,3.913978494623656
1902472,5,B0000A59ZH,"it's funny how these things happen.
i'm flicking through the channels late one night last week and happen upon a scene from a movie with a terrifically buxom blonde who has just stripped down to her underthings. naturally my eyes were riveted.
i don't remember too much more probably because i fell asleep.
several nights later,or,was it several nights before,while i was watching one of those late night chat shows(i think it was carson daly)who should be introduced but the very fetching actress krista allen. i knew her from the emmanuel in space series of movies(although i never watched one all the way through) and the girl-in-the-elevator scene with jim carey in liar,liar. again, i was half asleep so unfortunately i don't remember too much of the interview.
and then, and then, a few days ago i'm up late, eyes once again afixed to the tv screen and my nimble fingers caressing the remote button landing me on a movie......a movie with a very attractive tall blonde gal and THIS time i'm awake to watch it all the way through.
the movie was 'totally blonde'.
as i'm watching it and enjoying more and more krista's character in the movie as she giggles and frowns and jumps up and down to whatever the situation is, the scene, THAT scene, where our terrifically buxom blonde begins to strip down to her bare essentials appears and i gleefully recall ""oh! i saw that a few days ago!"" now i'm REALLY wishing i had payed attention to the daly interview a few nights before! arghhh
anyway,
in this movie, krista who plays a girl named meg is having an emotional tug-of-war with a guy she likes and another guy who she is really heads over heels for.  but the guy she just likes, or as she calls him, her 'friend', happens to be the real life singer(or more accurately, crooner)michael buble. and michael, in this movie, plays a guy named van who owns a jazz club featuring himself as a singer very much in the mold of michael himself. i hope this is not too confusing! lol
anyway, van is a very sweet guy and meg is very close to upgrading him from 'friend' status to something more when along comes an old high school crush-the guy she falls head over heels with. but van is really smitten with meg and sings to her several times in his soft and debonair style-anything a girl would melt for.
i did not realize until after the movie was over that this singing and the actor playing van is actually the singer michael buble~!
as well as having an outstanding singing style, michael is a very good actor. i really enjoyed watching his character in this movie. the part he played, van, was so likeable and natural and easy-going.
it kind of makes your head spin when meg becomes infatuated with her old high school crush who's a rather dorky(but, yes, hot looking hunk)surfer dude and in the process giving van his walking papers.
without giving the whole story away i would like to conclude with what i feel is a new discovery-her name:krista allen.
in this movie, she played her part of meg so sweet and playful. i really fell for her in a big way. she may look like a typical stuck up 'dumb blonde' but that stereotype does not apply here to fun-loving and big-hearted meg.
as played by krista i really fell in love with her, and krista.
i also thank this movie for introducing me to mr. buble-a great singer and actor .
if i may sum up this movie it would make sense to use the code that van himself uses several times during the movie......""i.a.g."" which stands for 'it's all good'!
oh wait!........it's not ALL good because the dvd version of totally blonde does not.....repeat....does NOT include the ESSENTIAL scene wherein meg/krista strips down to her bare essentials! this scene on the dvd is severely edited!  for shame for shame
i have to deduct a star for that!",1162080000,,3777,4.569321533923304
1902473,5,B0000A59ZH,"I gave the video 5 stars because it is Michael Buble's first movie and he is wonderful in it!!  And, I love the music of the big band era.  But quite frankly, the movie is a little cheesy!  You really have to be a Buble' fan to appreciate it!  It's a 2 star movie with a 5 star entertainer!!",1154476800,,291,3.8813559322033897
1902474,2,B0000A59ZH,"I watched this movie only to see Michael Buble.  Everything in this movie was disappointing except Michael's voice.  The songs were not up to his class, however--quite disappointing.  The female star in this movie is awful.  How did Michael get into this mess of a movie?  He is also much better looking than this movie shows him.",1146787200,,330,4.719298245614035
1902495,2,B0000A59ZH,"That was the only reason that I purchased this movie was so that I can watch Michael Buble....other than that, this movie wasn't very good at all.  Krista Allen plays this woman that can't pick the right guy, and when the right guy (Michael Buble) comes along, she's not interested in him.  He plays a really nice guy in the movie.  I didn't find this movie to be funny although it tried to be funny, it was more corny!  So, only get this movie if your a Michael Buble Fan!  I paid less than $7.",1144627200,3,495,4.168421052631579
1902496,3,B0000A59ZH,"I would recommend this movie for hardcore Michael Buble' fans only. Other than that, the plot is predictable, we've seen it all before with mostly bad acting, except for Buble' who turns out to be the best actor in the film, with some pretty good singing too.",1139788800,3,259,4.531914893617022
1902497,3,B0000A59ZH,"So, I love love loved this movie when I watched it a week ago on t.v.  I ordered it on Amazon so I could share it with my fiance.  As I started to watch, low and behold, it's edited.  It doesn't tell you this when you go to order it.  The best parts of the movie aren't there!  It's pretty bad when the t.v. version has less editing than the dvd.  Be smart and look for the UNedited version, it's so much more funny.",1138320000,17,416,3.892857142857143
1902498,4,B0000A59ZH,This movie wasn't as bad as some of the other viewers said. A total chick flick! Watch and see I don't want to give it away!,1133827200,,124,3.8076923076923075
1902499,3,B0000A59ZH,"Although the movie Totally Blonde wasn't all that great, Michael Buble was awesome! He was the best actor in the movie. I love his voice!. I have his c.d It's Time, and everyone should go out and get it. Me and my friend watched this movie a couple of days ago, because we were having a Michael Buble-athon. lol.

This movie is alright, but the reason why we keep on watching it is because of Michael!",1124496000,3,401,4.276315789473684
1902500,1,B0000A59ZH,"If this horrid flick were used to soften up terrorists at Gitmo instead of Christina Aguilaras' singing any terrorist would crack within 5 minutes.  Michael Buble is a wonderful singer and an actor with promise but his agent should be shot for getting him in this mess of a movie. Krista Allen should be shipped to the Antarctica ASAP before she strikes again. She is the biggest waste of time and space I've ever witnessed.  She can't act and she's so stupid that I don't believe that she's capable of anything but screwing something up. Until I saw this travisty I thought that the two worst movies I had ever seen were ""Ulzana's Raid""--only movie I ever walked out on because of blood and violence--and ""The Good, Bad and Ugly""--neverending, truly awful, spaghetti Western.  Little did I know that I hadn't even begun to see the worst.  Awful storyline, terrible acting, script must have been written by a couple of 6th grade boys.  I wish I could give this movie minus 10 stars.",1120435200,4,982,4.6531791907514455
1902501,3,B0000A59ZH,"The thing that gets me the most about this movie is...in what alternate universe is Krista Allen not hot?  She actually looks worse as a blonde, but I digress.  The plots not exactly the most original thing I've ever seen, but it's enjoyable with a few funny moments.  Michael Buble is really the best reason to watch.  His voice is amazing.  The scenes in the club are great.  Bottom line...this movie won't change your life but it's not a complete waste of time.",1112572800,,464,4.530120481927711
1902502,1,B0000A59ZH,"This is easily one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.  Let's be honest, folks.  I like Michael Buble - his singing even in this movie is amazing, but I think I'd rather be beaten silly than watch it again.

I'd say, in fact, that Michael's singing is the movies only redeeming quality.  And he actually is the best actor in the whole film... and that's not saying much.",1111190400,6,374,4.3768115942028984
1902503,5,B0000A59ZH,I love this movie!! I am in love with Michael Buble so i was very excited to watch this movie. I watched it last night and i plan to go out and buy it soon.  I hope all of you go out and buy his cds too.  He is a amazing singer and person.  I hope ya'll like him too.,1085702400,2,267,3.4166666666666665
1902504,4,B0000A59ZH,"I guess I'm a sucker for movies where the boy longs for a particular kind of girl and finds his true love in the end.  Even though this movie doesn't spend much time on whether or not Krista Allen's character's hair color is changing her love life (because so much more is going on than that), it's a movie with its heart in the right place...and we get to see Krista Allen as more than a one dimensional character.  (Yes, she really can act!)  There are a couple of things about the plot that are a little unexpected (hey, this isn't Citizen Kane), but overall the people making it seemed to be enjoying themselves...and the ending is very sweet.
Michael Buble's singing is also terrific (especially if you're a Sinatra fan like me).  I recommend you plug his name into iTunes and see all the albums he's released since this movie.  Great singing!
I've added this movie to my DVD collection and will watch it whenever I feel like dreaming of meeting the right lady for me.",1085356800,,973,4.47457627118644
