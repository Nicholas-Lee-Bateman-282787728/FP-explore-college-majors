2384596,5,B000ACQXHW,"The Shape Up series of workouts are short but intense. The workouts are more endurance strength training with very short cardio bursts. If you prefer to go slow-and-heavy with weights then Jillian's workouts are not for you. I like the fact that they're short workouts because I usually add in a cardio workout (30-45 mins.). So a rotation for me would be for Week 1: Shape Up Front plus 30 mins. cardio on Day1, Shape Up Backside plus 30 mins. cardio on Day2 and alternate them for one whole week. On the 2nd Week: Day1 is Jillian Michaels Maximize Full Frontal and 30 mins.cardio, Day2 is Jillian Michaels Back in Action plus 30 mins. cardio and alternate them again for one whole week. Try it and you will get GREAT RESULTS. It's also VERY important to eat healthy - CLEAN EATING!",1135296000,8,783,4.560283687943262
2384597,3,B000ACQXHW,"When I first read the description of this DVD, I thought it was going to be a weight training workout.  When I actually got the DVD, I found a very different workout than I expected.  It is a very intense cardio workout during which you do some upper body weight training.  However, because of the pace and how the weights are used in some parts of the workout (i.e, overhead), I had to go down from the usual 5 lb. hand weights I use for home workouts to the 2-pounders in order to keep up.  Now that I've done the workout once, I know that I could keep my 5-pounders nearby and switch to those for standard weight-training exercises such as tricep kickbacks, but keep the 2-pounders for aerobic movements with weights.

I exercise 5 days a week and do a combination of cardio, weight training and toning, so I'm in relatively good shape.  However, I am still about 35 pounds overweight (not to mention over age 50), so I found some of the cardio movements (mountain climbers, plyos, etc.) either too tough or too fast to keep up with.  I got through the entire workout, which was a half-hour I believe, but I had to do some alternative movements here and there.  (P.S. You need an aerobic step for this workout--she uses it as an aerobic step and also to lay on to do some weight work, etc.)

No doubt about it, Jillian is tough.  I truly believe that, if I was physically able to do this workout exactly as offered, I would see results.  However, that unfortunately isn't the case.  As a result, the workout had the effect of making me feel like a failure instead of inspiring and motivating me.  That's not Jillian's fault--I'm just saying that it makes sense for me to spend my money on workouts that energize me and lift me up instead of making me feel like I'm not good or strong enough.

Just to give you a basis for comparison, I rent and buy a LOT of exercise DVDs and it's not often I end up with one that I feel is above my fitness level.  When I first tried Tae-bo it seemed overwhelming, but now I can get through a 45-minute Tae-bo workout fine.  So yea, if I kept trying this Shape Up Front workout, it would no doubt eventually get easier for me.  However, doing the workout the first time did not leave me feeling motivated enough to keep putting myself through that workout until that happens.",1134604800,210,2312,4.377049180327869
2384598,4,B000ACQXHW,"This workout is for your chest, shoulders, abs and quads.  For every exercise, you do about 10=30 reps per set, but if you use a heavy enough set of weights, you will feel the burn.  There are the usuall squats, push ups, chest flies - all totally designed for sculpting although there is a little bit of heart raising work.  Just like on The Biggest Loser, she's tough and she's trying to make sure you'll get results.  She's always yelling at you to push yourself harder.  She IS motivating.  The good bonus, is that at the end, there is some recipes and nutrition tips for you.  Overall, I really enjoyed this workout and was sore for days.",1133827200,10,643,4.444444444444445
2384599,4,B000ACQXHW,"I would have to agree that the DVD Quality is somewhat poor, there are several functions on my remote that don't work with this DVD. The workout itself is great, its short, fun, and works you pretty good. She does simple mixes that make time fly by. The workout its about 25 minutes, but there is on chapter that just shuts off and then when I hit play it picks up close to where it left off. She has two main circuits-plus a nice warm up and cool down (both very short-but well meshed with the whole workout)",1130976000,9,509,4.204081632653061
2384600,5,B000ACQXHW,"This is an oldie but goodie. It may seem outdated to some folks but I can tell you that these tried and true exercises DO work!

You must be consistant and don't give up! Your muscles will be sore for a day or two the first time you do the video but DON'T give up!  The soreness will go away and if you do this 3-4 times a week you will see results FAST!  It's not an easy video to do but nothing good is EVER easy.

2384601,2,B000ACQXHW,"I love Jillian, but I think the distribution company was in such a hurry to release this DVD that they didn't QC them well.  I'm sure the work out is great, but I haven't had the chance to do it becuase as soon as the beginning warm up is over the DVD pauses and it brings me back to the main menu.  It would be fine if the work out was separated in the main menu by chapters but it is not.  If I fast forward past the problem spot that seems to work but who would want to do that each time?",1129766400,13,491,3.7475728155339807
2384602,2,B000ACQXHW,"This is old school Jillian. All of these from this collection of videos is. It is not the Jillian I am used to from Hard Body or One Week Shred. The workout is ok, but not refined like her newer ones. It just seems low quality and i am not used to that from her.",1459987200,,262,3.7818181818181817

2384604,3,B000ACQXHW,"I bought this at a thrift store for about $2, and while I like it, I'm glad I didn't pay full price. It's one 20-30 minute workout, and that's all (there might also be some nutrition advice, but that's not something that interests me). The workout itself is good--not only a tough cardio workout, but it'll also leave your legs sore. But the acting is terrible! I have several of Jillian's more recent videos, which I love, and I think Jillian does a great job in those. But in this one, Jillian acts sort of awkward and camera-shy, like she's trying too hard to be likeable, and it just was annoying for me. However, I'm able to turn the volume down and just watch what they're doing and get a good workout without becoming too irritated with the acting.

Overall, a good workout--but unless you find it at a thrift store, I would recommend buying one of her newer DVDs (such as Yoga Meltdown or 30-Day Shred) which give you more workouts and less irritation for the money.",1453766400,,974,4.47191011235955
2384605,5,B000ACQXHW,"Don't be fooled that this was released 10 years ago and may not be up to par with her newer dvds--it totally is. The workouts minus cool-down all range 22-25 minutes and if you use 8+ hand weights, you'll be dripping sweat. It's perfect for when you say you have no time because they aren't that long and you can say goodbye to the excuses.",1451692800,,340,4.246153846153846
2384606,5,B000ACQXHW,I love this series.  She is positive and not yelling at you like her other workouts.  Also she doesn't curse in these DVDs. I really see great results.,1449964800,,151,4.357142857142857
2384607,5,B000ACQXHW,"I've had these since 2007, and they're STILL my favorite workout.  I feel amazing, have so much energy, and look my absolute, sculpted best when I'm using these.  I've also gotten the Body Revolution series, but I always seem to come back to these.  I like to know my workout. These are great for me, because they're highly varied within each workout, so I get the combination of predictability I like with never getting bored.  And, man, do I see results! These are also great for working your way up.  If you're a beginner, be ready to modify for a little bit as you get into it.  Whenever I come back to them, I usually take it easy for a time or two through, and make sure to let myself take a 30-second break halfway through to catch my breath and grab some water.  Then, launch!  Back into it!  And once you're building up, these are great for meeting you where you are, all the way up to your advanced best.

I can't emphasize enough how amazing these DVDs make me feel, and how amazing they make me look!  If you're looking for a great set of workout DVDs or a great way to start with Jillian (but you don't want just one DVD), these are them.",1448064000,,1151,4.258064516129032

2384617,4,B000ACQXHW,"This is a set of progressively harder workouts.  I do like the name of the set.  I've had these for a while and my favorite is the cardio kickboxing.  The others go off a push pull philosophy.  She mixes cardio with weights and they are very effective for short workouts.  I think these are better than some of the more risky moves trainers are going toward now.  The only draw back is Jillian is young and obviously not use to being in front of the camera.  She's great at instructing, but is silly and laughs a lot.  One or two times viewing isn't that big of a deal, but when you watch it over and over it does tend to get on your nerves.  I would call these intermediate workouts. If they are done with heavy weights, more advanced.  A good go to if you want around 20 minutes to work out.  I think it is more beneficial to workout more than 20 minutes and have turned to Cathe Fredrick for most of my workouts now.  I might use these when I'm in a hurry or just want something different.",1428624000,,992,4.163157894736842

Likewise, as someone that has done cardio kickboxing at a martial arts studio in the past, I find that she moves too quickly through the moves.

Second, Jillian Michaels is a crazy workout ""Queen"". I admire her drive and unstoppable attitude. These workouts are no joke at all, but they work and even get a little easier if you just stick with it.
On December 22, 2012, I weighed 200 pounds - a weight that I have been striving to stay away from because it puts me at almost 60 pounds overweight. I was always tired, lazy, and I own very little clothing items in size 16 (women's). So I declared that I was tired of being fat which is why I ordered this workout.
On Januaray 22, 2013 (2 days ago), I weighed in at 190 pounds, and I am so happy about that. I intend to keep doing these very intensive, high-power workouts Jillian has put together.
Cardio-Kickbox is my favorite. She does each exercise in sets of 10, 20, or 30 reps, and she goes directly from one straight into the next one which is why the heart rate elevates, and the calories burn off. It was so hard when I did it the first time, and honestly, I did not complete it. But now, I not complete that DVD, but I push myself to complete the others as well.

2384666,4,B000ACQXHW,"I purchased this set because I was looking to work out and I do not like the gym. I was primarily interested in the kickboxing dvd but found all of the videos to be a fun workout. They actually raised my heart rate and made me sweat a bit. I usually only did one dvd per day.

The reasons why I'm not giving this product a 5 star review is because I have taken kickboxing classes (without the use of any equipment) and this dvd did not meet my expectation to the workout. It did not have enough of the kickboxing moves. It was still fun and worked me out though.

Also some of the dvds involve a step and weights to do the work out which meant I ended up purchasing more products.

Overall I would recommend if you are looking for a quick workout at home.",1341792000,,755,4.087837837837838
2384667,5,B000ACQXHW,"I bought this DVD set at Half Price books and I think I got a fantastic deal- these DVDs are GREAT!! I like these even better than the 30 day Shred series because she doesn't talk/ explain each move- fine when you're first starting but after 25 times I think I know what comes next. She also is funny ( I think) in this series as this is before she became a huge celebrity- so she seems more ""real"" not scripted.  I also feel like these workouts go by fast because you keep moving- there are no rest periods and  I like that because its over before I know it and I am drenched in sweat.  My boyfriend has said that only when I do Jillian Michaels can he see a big difference compared to other workout methods.  If you want the biggest ""bang for you buck"" and maximize your time- this is the workout for you. Also- she uses a step in the workout but I do the workout without and ""step up"" onto my workout mat and its still a great workout, I would say get the step if you need the advanced version.  Its a co ed DVD- so all of you guys that think this workout is for women only, think again- you will also get a great workout too. If you're still unsure- I check out all the DVDs I purchase from the library first to see if I like it enough to purchase.",1341100800,,1252,4.0120481927710845

First of all I bought this set back when people were not feeling Jillian Michaels like they are now so I knew then she was tough.  You will get results, but you have to work hard and stop crying about her using a step.  I also like her personality in this dvd because she is having fun and not being so rude like she is in her newest videos.  If you want your heart in your throat get this set and use the step.  You will feel this one!",1338854400,,517,3.876190476190476
2384669,4,B000ACQXHW,"Most of my workout videos are Jillian's, so I know her style and really enjoy her tough, down to business approach. However, with this set, unlike her stand alone videos, it was extremely fast paced, so fast that once she started each exercise, by the time I got my body set up, about three reps had passed, so I didn't get the required number of reps in. Also, it was so fast I didn't feel like I was in good form, something I think is really important, for safety and to get the most out of each workout. Jillian herself even emphasizes form. It seemed like she was trying to squeeze what is really a 45 minute workout into 30 minutes. If you like Jillian too, I would recommend her strength video No More Trouble Zones or her cardio video Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism over this set.",1337731200,,785,4.346938775510204

2384672,5,B000ACQXHW,"Its been a while since I've tried any type of exercise video. So, after purchasing this set almost a month ago, I set it on top of speaker and left it there. Finally, I decided to try it instead of a walk today. I thought for sure that Jillian was going to kill me. I was pleasantly surprised, however, when I realized this is a DVD that I can master. I tackled more than half of it today, and only took breaks when my heart rate was really high.. jumping back in when I felt more rested. I'm confident that I can use this in my routine, and use it as a stepping stone to really being active again. Once I've gotten back to my former energetic self, I'm glad I will have the videos at my disposal for when I'm traveling or need a quick workout I can do at home.

So, if you are getting back into exercise, give this video a try. Take it slowly. You don't have to do the whole thing the first time.. but you'll definitely be able to work your way up!

Note: The video suggests you have dumbbells (2-5 lbs) and a step. I don't own a step, so I just modified the exercises as I went along.",1330905600,,1086,4.023148148148148
2384673,5,B000ACQXHW,"I do not like Jillian (she's annoying), but I do love her kickboxing workout. It's packed with tons of cardio, and you'll be sweating after the warm-up.

I like this workout for a couple reasons. First, everything is easy to do, but you really work up a sweat doing it. She also repeats each exercise (various times). Each exercise is about 30 seconds so it's not too long either, but she moves right to another exercise, which brings out the cardio. You are ALWAYS moving in this workout.

The only tiny downside is that there's no punching combos or anything like that. It really is cardio but with kickboxing mixed in (I still love it though!). Jillian's new kickboxing DVD (coming out this March) looks like it has combos so I'm REALLY excited to try that one.

I'll usually do this workout 2 days a week (by itself), and it's usually in the middle of the week to mix in with my other workouts. You could definitely add this on to another workout though. It's 30 minutes, but it goes by quickly.",1329609600,,999,4.478021978021978
2384674,3,B000ACQXHW,"If you are looking for a real quick, but yet a somewhat aggressive workout, this should do fine.  This video is only 20 minutes long which is great to do during the work week.
However, the video is a bit annoying.  It seemed like Jillian was out of shape for her own workout.  She kept grasping for air.  Also, she was in such a giddy mood.  She kept laughing and giggling throughout the video.  It was pretty weird.  Regardless, this is still a keeper for me because I don't have a lot of time to spend on exercising and this video does enough to get my heart pumping and body moving.",1328832000,,585,4.216216216216216
2384675,3,B000ACQXHW,"I was really excited to be receiving these work-out videos from Jillian Michaels.  I admire her attitude on the show, ""Biggest Looser,"" which I've admittedly only watched a few times.  While these work-out videos are definitely challenging enough for someone such as myself who works-out to Insanity, P90X, other beach-body work-outs, 1/2 marathon training, etc., the videography is very disappointing.  It jumps around a lot, which makes it difficult to see the exact work-out technique.  I like to make sure I am completing the work-out correctly by using the correct form.  Also, none of Jillian's crew perform the modified version of the exercise.

There is no instructional video to show beginners how to perform the exercise.  Each video contains the same extra features - so it really is not anything special.

Each work-out is only thirty-minutes long, which you would not know until actually completing the work-out.  These videos do not contain the timer count-down as P90X or Insanity.  This is understandable because the videos are not produced by Beach Body; however, I am used to the timer, and I like it.

There are five work-out DVDs in this package, and there are five videos.  I am disappointed that there are not more work-outs.  It would be much better if there was more than one work-out on each DVD.

The work-outs require a Step.  I wish I had known this before ordering the DVDs.  Now, I am going to buy a step - to add to my gym.  The minimalist might be more upset, but I am trying to slowly buy enough gym equipment so I don't have to set foot in an actual gym ever again if I do not want to.  You could try to modify Jillian's exercises, so as to not have to buy a step, but to me, this doesn't seem as fun.

On the plus side, these work-outs are challenging and fun.  I like that I can easily play my own music during the video.  Because they are each only thirty-minutes, I can easily work these into my routine.  I love Jillian's attitude.  Her quirky laugh is cute and motivational.  These are great videos for anyone who wants to mix-up their routine or get in great shape!",1328400000,3,2106,4.599462365591398
2384676,4,B000ACQXHW,"I was not impressed w/ this series when I first got it. I actually put it away for about a year until I received a heart rate monitor for Christmas, which caused me to do EVERY dvd workout I own. Some of these dvds surprised me:

(In order of my preference):

1. Maximize - Back in Action
I had never even done this workout before. I am a dental hygienist so I cannot focus on my arms too much early in the week. If I want to work out my arms, I have to do it Thursday or Friday because I do not get to rest my arms at work (constantly have them lifted) and cannot handle it together.
I used light weights and was pleasantly surprised that I was able to feel the workout, but not be too sore at work. In addition, this video burned the most calories for me (133lbs) at 285 calories in 25 minutes. It is actually at the top of my ""30 minutes or less workout"" for burning the most. 11.4 calories per MINUTE.

2. Cardio Kickbox
I love kickboxing, so did use this dvd a few years ago. I burned 282 calories in 25 minutes w/ this dvd. High energy and high heart rate!

3. Maximize Full Frontal
249 calories in 26 minutes. Personally, does not impress me. Anything under 10 calories a minute is not my 'go to workout'. This is ranked 7th in my '30 minutes or less videos'. Good for arms and they did get tired, so it definitely serves its purpose

4. Shape Up - Backside
8 calories a minute... not impressed. Again, others might be, but I have been doing this too long to be impressed w/ that. Its last in my calories burned rank, but again, for beginners, definitely a keeper. She gets you going!

5. Shape Up - Front
I ranked this last because I let my sister borrow this DVD and when she gave it back to me, the DVD was not there... so I have not tested this one out!",1327190400,3,1764,4.083815028901734
2384677,4,B000ACQXHW,"Compared to Jillian's current workouts, this is almost a breeze.  It's intense, don't get me wrong -you're constantly moving, working up a sweat, getting good cardio.  But it's nowhere near as physically demanding as other kickbox workouts I've done, and it's only about 20 minutes long.

Also unlike her current dvds, this is a class setting.  Jillian interacts with her class throughout, joking and laughing. There is a sense of camaraderie.  Being an early dvd from Jillian, her demeanor is slightly different from her current persona - she's downright goofy at times here. Not a lot of coaching going on, or talk of form.  It's pretty basic kickboxing - front kicks, back kicks, roundhouse. Squats, jump rope, jab-cross and uppercuts, fast feet and standing abs.

To maximize, I do this workout 3 different ways.  1. I do Jillian's Cardio Kickbox first, followed by Denise Austin's Power Kickboxing.  2. I do Cardio Kickbox three times in a row.  The first two times, as is, and I use 2 1/2 lb weights for the jab-cross. The final time, I drop the weights and skip the jumping jacks.  3. I increase the reps of each exercise as I go along, turning it into one hour long workout.  For instance, instead of just 10 body-crosses, I'll do 40 each interval. Instead of 30 seconds of fast feet, I'll do one minute or more.  Instead of just 10 front-kick-back-kicks, I'll do 30, and so on.

As it is, a perfectly acceptable, intense, sweaty cardio workout.  But I'd love to see Jillian do an updated kickboxing dvd.",1325548800,,1512,4.739463601532567
2384678,5,B000ACQXHW,I love this dvd box set. I just got it for Christmas this year 2011 . Just got done doing the first dvd out of the box set. It was a hard workout but totally worth it. Like another review said it has a beginner person to show you the modified  moves so it easier to start out . I cant believe my first time doing this dvd is was sweating alot had to take a couple brakes in between the workout .,1324944000,,395,3.7590361445783134

2384680,3,B000ACQXHW,"VIDEO QUALITY
I would have given this a better rating if the video quality were better. It was a little fuzzy to me. Also, the music intro is a bit 1990's looking to me, and the workout just didn't have a very good ""ambiance"". I prefer workouts videotaped in energetic surroundings. This workout is taped in a warehouse locker room looking room (bricks and lockers).

EQUIPMENT
You will need light dumbells and a step!!

WORKOUT
The workouts themselves are great for circuit training. They are definitely for the intermediate to advanced. I would suggest you only try this if you are about 10 pounds overweight or are pretty in shape. I tried these postpartum at 60 pounds overweight. I couldn't handle it.

I've been a fan of Jillian Michael's workout videos for a few years, and these videos by far are the best yet.  The workouts are approximately 25 minutes long.  At first I thought that wouldn't be long enough to get a genuine workout.  I was so wrong.  I have never sweat so much in such a short period of time, and I'm so sore!  I work full time and I'm a mom of three kids, and finding the time to exercise is always a challenge.

2384683,4,B000ACQXHW,"I was really not prepared for this! It's actually a very good workout but it's probably not designed for the average 50 year old like me. I love the cardio kickboxing routine which I cope with quite well, although like all the workouts, it's full on and in your face. What I didn't realise is that all the other workouts require an aerobic step platform and that weights are used. I have weights but not the step so at present I'm doing it all as if I have a step. I prefer workouts without props.  To all you 40 plus year olds I highly recommend the  ""10 minute solution Kettlebell Ultimate Fatburner"" workout in which the instructor uses a dumbell rather than a kettlebell throughout, so no need to rush out and get a kettlebell. I alternate those workouts with one of these and the occasional walk throughout the week.
All in all the biggest winner is a good one though if you're into high impact tough workouts.",1309910400,,915,4.440476190476191

It's a doable, complete workout in half an hour, it's not too repetetive, and after a few weeks you can mute it and play music if Jillian's voice gets too annoying.",1308009600,,457,4.264367816091954

So i was already disappointed that this DVD was only 30 minutes, and when it comes down to it its closer to twenty. Also it is WAY too easy. And not really kickboxing. You do more squats, jump-roping, and jumping jacks than any kickboxing moves. Towards the end i finally broke a sweat and was getting reved up and it was over..... But i will give it 3 stars because it is an overall okay workout. Maybe for days i need a break from my more intense practices.

2384689,2,B000ACQXHW,"First of all, I LOVE that the workout videos Jillian Michaels came out with after her Biggest Winner series only require dumbbells, and at least two of her videos (Yoga Meltdown and Burn Fat Boost Metabolism) doesn't even make use of that and still provides a kick butt workout.

Secondly, I just prefer Jillian Michael's personality today.  She seems to have become more authentically simple and interested in fitness for health, not just for looks.  She still kicks but, and she makes sure you remember that if you want to have a nice body you have to swim in your own sweat, but there is something about her personality in older videos that don't jive with me.  I bought these five video set recently, and I will give it a try (I don't like wasting money, after all), but, I am not so inspired.  I have looked at them, and not having a stepper has not let me start trying these yet (as well as the fact that I am doing other workout videos), but, we'll see.

But when Jillian calls out ""jumping jacks"", ""high knees"" and ""squats on three"" I am right on cue. This makes the workout fun and still challenging while ensuring you aren't going to end up with a strained back. I use the videos to mix up my week between the gym, trail runs, hiking or other physical activities. They are simple, fun and challenging and easily adjustable to your fitness level and I have used them over and over again for two years. I also recommend  Ilaria Montagnani (Powerstrikes and Bodystrikes) for those of you who appreciate professional athletes teaching great fitness with an emphasis on correct posture and good form instead of silly matching outfits.",1300147200,2,840,4.7534246575342465

The circuit training keeps your heartrate up and definitely makes you sweat! All that's needed is some light weights, yoga mat, and aerobic stepper for plyometrics.

I was sweating, sure, but when it was over I could have done the whole thing over again easily.  Not nearly the butt-kicking challenge I expect from Jillian Michaels.

The production of the video is low quality and Jillian seems like she is nervous for some reason, which is really odd.  Compared to the Shred video, this one seems to have been done on a much, much lower budget.  Which is possible, as it was made in 2005.  I can deal with that, however, if the workout is awesome.  It's just not.

I gave up my gym membership, and Purchased a BowFlex Revolution a while back thinking I could cut my monthly gym cost down, and still get in a good workout.  Boy was I wrong.  Don't get me wrong the BowFlex is a good piece of equipment in addition to having a gym membership, it just doesn't stand on its own merits for serious gym minded people such as myself.

I've had to really start to become creative in how I workout, as a result of my purchasing my BowFlex Revolution.  This is where Jillian Michael's ( Cardio Kickboxing ) comes in.  From time to time I like to buy various dvds on yoga, Martial Arts, and aerobics.  This DVD ( Cardio Kickboxing ) really has stood up as great workout tool.  Its gotten to the point for me using this DVD, that I end up going beyond some of her moves, and actually changing them into different moves from time to time.  I can't say enough good things about this DVD so I won't try to.  Except to say Jillian makes you sweat, she makes you feel good about yourself working out doing the dang thang.

My only fault with this DVD is the advertisement is its current asking price.  When I bought this DVD brand new about a year ago its was selling for $14.00 dollars.  Now The current selling price its going for $49.00 dollars this must be wrong.  Jillian has a lot to offer people it will be a same for people not to experience the same benefits I have experienced using her DVD because of greed.  That's why I say the asking price for her DVD must be a misprint.  Jillian Michael's is well worth the money if you could afford to have her personally train you, but until then there's her dvds.

I felt these workouts were a bit more challenging but nothing too crazy. I got results using this series, which helped me get over the ""plateau"" I was stuck on. I'm on to other workouts for the time being, but these are in my rotation, and I look forward to getting back to them!",1290124800,,601,4.375

I was seriously more sore after my first Cardio Kickbox session than I was from an hour at the gym running and weight training.  I kind of love the idea that Jillian is talking to me (the audience) and her perfectly timed commands are eerie.

The only warning I have about these videos is that if you have bad knees, this may not be the best system for you. Lot of high impact moves.

In order to optimize your experience I would recommend you have access to a step bench, a yoga mat and some light weights.",1288051200,2,623,4.158333333333333
2384702,2,B000ACQXHW,"I checked this DVD out from the library, as I usually do before purchasing. I do own Shred and really like it, and I've tried a few of the Biggest Loser workouts and am usually pretty happy with those as well. To put this in context, I'm at a pretty high fitness level (spinning, running, kickboxing, circuit training, etc), have lost a lot of weight, and am working on getting the last 10 lbs off. Bob Harper's boot camp workout was doable but definitely gave me a workout, as did the full BL Cardio Max. I was confused with this one right off the bat. I never thought I'd describe JM as too giggly, but she is in this dvd, and she stops the workout - which is only about 22 minutes - several times, for silly reasons. First, she makes us stand there and wait while she stops several minutes into the routine to pull her hair back in a ponytail. Then a few times she actually stops to turn around and stare at the people doing the workout - presumably to scold them for not working hard enough, I guess. Only she leaves those of us at home hanging around and waiting for the workout to start back up. The workout itself is not a bad one if you're just looking to do a quick cardio routine. I like kickboxing and enjoyed a lot of her moves. But she seemed very unfocused, kept giggling, looking at her team, and trying to remember what was next. Finally, at the end, she was, literally, out of breath, which I also found confusing, as I was decidedly NOT out of breath. Ain't no way I'm in better shape than she is. Bottom Line: not a bad workout for a quick one but could get very annoying very quickly. Check it out or rent it. Don't buy it. If you want a good 20-25 minute cardio workout, get Shred. As another reviewer said, maybe if you put your TV on mute. And then maybe if you did jumping jacks during her weird breaks in the routine, it would be okay. But if I'm looking for a 20-minute workout, it's not going to be this one.",1287964800,9,1935,4.190348525469169

2384712,4,B000ACQXHW,"NOTE: All of ""The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing"" workouts by Jillian Michaels seem to have their reviews linked together.  However, this review is ONLY for her Cardio Kickbox workout.

Jillian Michaels had made a reputation of being one of the toughest trainers that there is, and this workout is no exception.  In this workout, however, as opposed to some of her more recent workouts, Jillian, has a more fun personality.  She is still tough, and she will still push you and be motivational at the same time, but she also will jokes and laugh throughout the workout.

There is a quick motivational intro by Jillian at the beginning, but then you start the warm up.  The warm up is a really short mixture of squats, kicks, and jumps.  It's pretty much of a really short workout in itself.

Next, you move on to the actual workout.  Jillian will cover everything from jumping jacks to punches to side kicks, and she will make it tough but fun.  She goes REALLY fast, though, so get ready.  I've never seen an instructor do punches, kicks, or jumps so quickly in a video.  I sometimes felt like my technique would be bad because of this, and I would have to slightly slow down to keep my technique good.  Jillian will also pretty much go from one move to another, so aside from one or two instances, you really don't get any kind of break.  The workout itself is about 20 minutes, which, trust me, is long enough!  This workout is intense cardio that will really push you physically!  Definitely not for beginners!

Then, at the end, there will be a short cooldown where you will be led through stretching of the shoulders, hamstrings, and neck.  That's it, though.  No more leg stretches or arm stretches, and I felt that there could have been just a few more.  After the cooldown, there is another quick motivational talk by Jillian.

Overall, this was a really great cardio workout that I will be doing very often.  It is extremely difficult, and this is coming from an advanced exerciser.  Other than the few cons of it being a little too fast or too few stretches in the cooldown, it is still a great workout that I recommend if you are looking for a short, no-nonsense kickboxing workout.",1274486400,7,2200,4.541984732824427
2384713,3,B000ACQXHW,I thought is more about focusing on the muscles but it had a lot of cardio that I wasn't interested in. It is hard to find muscle focused workouts with no cardio but I am pretty sure I found it in Jillians no more trouble zones.,1274486400,2,228,3.9782608695652173
2384714,4,B000ACQXHW,This was a good workout but before I knew it it was over.  She does some really good moves and I did break a sweat in the short period of time.  I will definitely add this dvd to my weekly routine.,1271462400,2,197,3.7804878048780486

2384728,4,B000ACQXHW,"I found this workout on YouTube and loved it so much, I ordered it. The workout is great! It's 30 minutes of non-stop cardio.

The first consists of things such as side kicks, punches, front kicks, knee crosses, jumping jacks, and the like. The second is fast feet, back kicks, and uppercuts. Then, the finale is thirty jump ropes, thirty jumping jacks, and ten pushups. The workout is great, but I find Jillian and little bit too much in this DVD. She yells quite a bit, does a lot of giggling, and tries to overact. By that, I mean she tries to hard to make the workout seem tough, with the excessive panting and fussing.

2384739,4,B000ACQXHW,"First, you do not need any other equipment for this DVD. Some people are writing that you need a step and I think they must be referring to the other DVDs she has put out. This one can be done with nothing but enough space to kick (you jump rope with an invisible rope).

Pros: Jillian does the whole thing with you. I'm almost positive it is one continuous shot. She breaths heavily and never has the freshly hydrated/toweled off look. I really appreciate that because I hate ones where they obviously film in segments and then the instructor is yelling at you to keep going and you just spend your time resenting that they obviously stopped to check their makeup and grab a drink in between segments.
Jillian is motivational. Some people say she is mean in her videos, but I can tell you that is not the case here. She says things like it isn't going to kill you"" or ""stay with us"" right when I'm about to give up. It isn't rude. She also tends to giggle here and there (which some say is annoying), but I think it shows that she is having a good time and enjoying the endorphin rush.
It is challenging because she hops from one thing to the next with out a break which is hard for out of shape people like me. So mid-way, I had to start cutting down on some of the things (doing 5 kicks instead of 10). I can't wait to be able to do the whole thing.

I also like that Jillian acknowledges that it is hard. When she introduces the person doing the modified workout, she says that it is still hard even with modification. I don't like the programs that are like ""Too easy drill sergeant!"" when we all know it ain't easy. So the fact she was very real about it made me feel good.

CON: There is no correction of technique. I would have liked more instruction on proper form - like telling me to make sure to do X or Y as I went. I don't know how to punch and I think my arms and legs became a little nilly willy as I got more tired. I also started to get off balance and I think it is probably due to me not really knowing how to place my feet. It was sort of a ""do the moves"" attitude instead of ""do it right"".

Do NOT do this if you have back problems (lots of bouncing which might be why my back hurt). I have bad knees and they were okay even though there was a lot of squat positions which I usually can't do at all. I did this while my wrist was hurt and I was fine.",1248134400,12,2372,4.051172707889126
2384740,5,B000ACQXHW,"I know a lot of people are put off by Jillian's attitude, in my opinion that is what makes her such a good trainer, she has put in her time so I beleive she has every right to act a little full of herself, I mean LOOK AT HER.
As for the workout, I have lost 25 lbs. of course that is combined with a strict diet and 100 fluid oz of water a day.  There is no magic workout, I am sorry in order to lose weight you have to work out and diet, this is the best place to start, if you are a beginner, use lighter weights and work up to it.

I have only done the basic dvds so far, the front and back shape-ups.  The workouts are SHORT, maybe 10 minutes each.  I use them as a warm-up for some other workout dvds that I have.  I look forward to her Cardio Kickbox and more high-intensity Front/Back dvds (the other three in the set).

Things to know:
You need a step.  I don't have a step.
The ""beginner"" example hardly does any modifications, and she is rarely on screen anyway.
Jillian doesn't work out with you, and has, as mentioned, weird interactions with the people working out onscreen.
I didn't feel like there were enough sets--I think the workout just needed to be longer.

2384747,5,B000ACQXHW,"I just bought this DVD 2 weeks ago from Sports Authority [...].  I am not a fan of The Biggest Loser show (never really watched it), but I do know that the contestants lose an incredible amount of weight, so I was eager to try this.  It is an amazing DVD- kick butt workout, but not for beginners!  Jillian doesn't stress form or breathing techniques so for beginners, I recommend starting with a more instructional video in order to avoid injuries and maximize benefits.

This is a hard-core workout.  When Jillian says in the middle that you're not going to die, it definetely felt like I was going to the first couple of times.  I do this 3 times a week (alternating with strength training videos like Denise Austin).  In the two weeks I've been doing this (along with changing my eating habits to cut out sodas and unhealthy snacks totally), I'm already seeing results.  I've lost a few pounds and dropped an inch in size.

The first 2 or 3 times I did this workout, I had to pause to drink some water.  But now, I am able to go the whole way through and only sip at the times when she pauses.

I like the fact that she shows you and gives you a hard effective workout in a short amount of time.  Let's face it, we have lives to lead and that's most people's resoning behind not working out.

I decided they were a little more than I could handle and put them in the closet where they have sat since last winter.  I got them out again a couple weeks ago and discovered they were still difficult but I felt really great after using them.  I know that after 30 minutes I have really done something and my workout is out of the way for the day.

Note:  You will need a step, the longer ones are better than the shorter.  So plan on spending another 30-50 on a step.  Light weights.  I am starting with 3 & 5 pound weights.  My husband is starting with 5 & 8 pound weights.

2384754,5,B000ACQXHW,"I was urged to get this workout dvd collection by my sister-in-law, who lost 30 pounds in about 5 months doing nothing but these videos.  I am just getting started with them, but here's my take.

Pros:

The moves are simple.  A lot of exercise tapes are confusing and hard to follow.  It takes forever getting the complicated moves down.  I am totally uncoordinated and I look like a dork in aerobics classes.  But these videos are very straightforward.  Nothing complicated, nothing fancy.  Some people have criticized her for not emphasizing correct form, but in my opinion, all you need to do is watch the tape through one time and pay attention to the form of the participants.  It's not rocket science.  If you've exercised at all, you should know the basic forms for these exercises.  I appreciate the simplicity of the exercises.

It is fast paced.  I get bored very easily with workouts.  But this moves along so quickly and changes it up so much that you don't have time to think about being bored.  I love that it is only 30 minutes.  It's often hard for me to find an hour.  But 30 minutes I can do, and I feel like I've worked out for an hour.

I like Jillian's personality.  Although she has been criticized on here by others, I think she's fun.  She's upbeat, she is demanding, and she's positive.  I don't find her cuteness to be fake like I do with other video instructors.

I am feeling the results.  I am sore in places I didn't know I had.  This workout is WORKING.  I can tell.  It's tough...all kidding aside.  I'm not in super good shape and I'm approximately 25 pounds overweight.  But I can do the whole 30 minutes.  I may not be able to lift my legs as high and I may miss a few reps, but I can do it.  But its NOT easy.  But that's okay because I'm not looking for a light aerobic workout.  I want results and I want them quickly.  I can tell that I'm going to get that with this workout.

CONS:

You really do need to watch the tape through the first time, simply because you need to know what she means when she says ""20 mountainclimbers.""  She moves so quickly that she doesn't stop to explain what the set of reps is.  And sometimes the camera is focused on her and not the ones doing the exercise.  This isn't a big deal if you watch the tape one time through or have at least done it one time through.  But I think the camera work could have been a little better.

It's hard to deal with the pain at first.  My muscles are on fire after a week's worth of workouts.  I'm not sure this is a con per se...I mean...it's obviously a great workout...but some people may have a hard time sticking with it.  If you're in poor shape, you might want to start without any hand weights or a step and do everything at a very low level.  This workout is easy to overdo it with.

Overall, I highly recommend this workout!!",1234915200,2,2839,4.281663516068053
2384755,3,B000ACQXHW,"This is a quick bootcamp-style workout. Not a lot of complicated cardio, mostly athletic strength moves without weights. It changes quickly.

My heartrate is usualy around 50-60% maximum during most of the workout.",1234742400,,386,5.046875

After only 6 weeks, I have an amazing waist line and those cute belly curves are starting to form.
The workouts are quick and hard and I feel truly exhausted at the end of each one. If this is your first workout DVD at home, I recommend starting with the Cardio Workout and then trying one of the Shape-Up workouts. And get a step. I did the workouts for the first two weeks without one and noticed a big difference once I got the step.

2384763,5,B000ACQXHW,"I've never heard of Jillian Michaels (one of the few people in the nation that doesn't watch Biggest Loser!) until I saw her recommended on a healthy-living website I belong to. I ordered this set and her 30-day shred DVD.

I love these workouts! I've been an avid exerciser for years now, but I've never really been challenged until I got these DVDs. I've done Denise Austin, Prevention fitness systems DVDs, 10-minute solution DVDs, and some others, but those were my main workouts I went to again and again. Now that I've found Jillian, I'm hooked and can't wait to see what she comes out with next!

Each DVD workout is about 25-30 minutes long.  I've been using them in this order: Shape Up - Front, Shape Up - Back, Cardio Kickbox, Maximize - Full Frontal, Maximize - Back in Action; Mon.-Fri.  They are circuit training or interval training type workouts, which means you use a light set of weights and alternate between strength exercises and cardio exercises, sometimes using the weights during cardio sets.  She tells you to use any weight you're comfortable with and that pushes you (for me that's 5 pounds, a beginner might use 2-3 pounds, and advanced women or men might use 8-10 pounds or more).  You move quickly from exercise to exercise, and the time flys by.

Sometimes she gets a little chatty and seems to be wasting time, but only for a few seconds here and there.  She also has had the people exercising in the DVDs do more sets if she thinks they didn't try hard enough or it went too quick, which I thought wasn't fair to people at home using the videos!  I also thought it was strange that she doesn't do the whole workout - she goes around and watches the other people or makes it harder for them.  It makes me wonder if she could do the whole thing she's expecting others to do (I'm sure she can, just look at her, but I've never had a DVD where the instructor didn't do the whole workout with you).

So other than those minor complaints, I highly recommend these videos to people looking for a challenging workout that isn't time-consuming.  Most people only have 30 minutes or so to spend on exercise, and these DVDs fit the bill.",1233014400,2,2159,4.5218508997429305

2384766,2,B000ACQXHW,"I have the Cardio kickbox dvd and was very disappointed.  The pace of the workout seems very awkward, the instructor doesn't really know what is coming next, and most of all in between each different exercise, she just stops rather than keeping moving during the full amount of time.

2384769,4,B000ACQXHW,"I am a 35 year old woman and have been a regular exerciser for over 15 years. I like fast-paced, difficult aerobic workouts that last 40-60 minutes. I needed something to have at home in case I can't make it to the gym. I think there are pros and cons that go along with this DVD set.

Pros:
- I am usually sore (in a good ""feel the burn"" kind of way) the next day
- The exercises are simple and can be modified (she shows a beginner and advanced levels)
- The videos provide a good amount of exertion if you are willing to put in the work

Cons:
-The workouts are only a little over 20 minutes, so I end up doing 2 DVDs in a row. By the end of 2, I do feel like I've had a good workout. Just one per day will not transform anyone's body to look like Jillian's.
- Jillian doesn't follow the beat of the music
- There are no transitions from one exercise to another. It's just stop and start, stop and start.
- She sort of has a cheesy shtick

Given the cons, I do think the DVDs are good to have around when you can't get to the gym or out for a run or whatever. I often times turn them on while my toddler naps. So they're handy to have around. You'll need a few sets of hand weights and she uses a step, but I don't recommend buying one of you don't already have one.

To do the workouts you do need some lightweight dumbells and a little bench step thing, which I didn't know until I started doing the workouts.  And probably a sweat headband because your heartrate is up the entire time, the quality of the workouts are definately worth the price of the dvds.  Jillian has a team of people in the videos, and one person does a beginners version to the exercises which is still pretty intense, and I am in pretty decent shape so word of caution it is a nonstop workout so yeah...I'll definately buy more of her dvds in the future.",1231632000,,642,4.423728813559322

2384772,5,B000ACQXHW,"Wow.. I love Jillian.

With this dvd, you get what you give. If you slack & don't do what she says, then you won't see the results you want. Use heavier weights if this dvd's too easy. Use lighter weights if necessary, but this will BURN that fat off your butt or gut. She pushes you w/her ""hard core"" ways-- but you know, I'd definately say you have to be in somewhat descent shape to do this dvd.. Lots of core, lots of legs.. it's great if you love the PAIN of working out.. a good pain of course, but you know what I mean, ""the burn"" .. if you love it, and crave to be challenged, do this dvd.
It's got cardio in it.. with weights though..strength & cardio, all of it. It will tone you, just make sure you're watching what you eat on the side though.. sure you might get stronger with this dvd, but to lose the weight, don't over eat when you're trying to get fit.

I think this is a great work out DVD series to use.

What you should know:  You'll need weights and preferably a step to complete most of the routine.  (Why don't workout DVDs come with a big sticker on it that say ""you need X, Y, and Z for this workout""?)

This workout is not for the faint of heart.  When I first did it, I was really sore and fatigued.  And that's just after a 30 minute workout!  She does a good job of working multiple muscle groups at a time, as well as doing interval aerobic training.

One thing I don't like - I do wish she had an optional pre-warm up that was a little smoother.  I do like to have just a moment to stretch out and literally warm up my body first prior to jumping in.  Jillian's idea of a warm up is starting with 30 jumping jacks!  So when I do these workouts now, I spend a few minutes before I start trying to warm myself up.

As a trainer, I like Jillian's no-nonsense kind of style.  I like that she's sort of down to earth and playful with the others, but not in that cheesecake way that I hate from some trainers.

The set offers great variety.  Of course I have ones I like more than others (Maximize, Back in Action is my favorite).  But overall a great set for someone looking at short, effective work outs.",1231200000,3,1509,4.02020202020202
2384776,4,B000ACQXHW,When I bought these I was looking for some sort of workout to do at home while it is freezing outside ( I live where it gets really cold during the winter).  I decided to go with these DVD's as it came with 5 different workouts which I thought was  a great deal that way you don't have the same workout routine everyday it allows you to do a variety of things.  If you actually do the workouts as instructed and put your heart into it you'll find that it works you really good and you'll feel the workout afterwards.  If you just put a half heart into it you'll feel like these are a waste of money.  The one thing I wish I would have known before I bought these was she wants you to have special equipment like a stool and weights but you can improvise if needed.  The only other complaint I have is that you have to watch her little video every time about how working out has changed her life.,1231027200,3,895,4.085714285714285

2384778,5,B000ACQXHW,"I've only gotten through the first 2 DVD's, Shape up Front & Back, but I can tell you this is how a trainer will work you out at a real gym.  With regard to another buyer who commented that she gave this DVD series a 4 instead of a 5 due to the lack of instructions...well, if you read the DVD (it was either on the packaging or within the DVD words scrolling) to review the ENTIRE DVD before doing any of the exercises.

First of all, I do that with every DVD I use because how else can I record what I'm doing if I don't write it down.  Yes, I actually write down everything that's done and log it in my computer system so every time I do it, I'm not retyping but just seleting the workout so I know what it consisted of.

Anyway, it's a very intense set of DVD's and it's not for the beginner.  I also bought one of her other DVD's (30-Day Shred) but haven't use it yet as I bought them around the same time.  There are good reviews on this one too but you only get 3 separate workouts which are supposed to be progressive.  The reviewers pretty much tell you to alternate all three levels anyway so your workout won't get boring...just do the beginners versions on the ones that are difficult.  Sounds like a great idea to me.  I wouldln't have waited to progress anyway simply because I like to keep it interesting.

Remember, weight bearing exercises are extremely good for your joints and bones...i know I have chondromalacia patella...and if i can do them and feel MUCH better afterwards that's saying something.

Good luck to everyone using this.

The ""beginner"" she tells us to watch is rarely shown on the videos and even that beginner is slim and looks to be in good shape. No, I had hoped there would be a little more reality in this workout and not something I'd have to work out for a year before I can do.

If sweating is what you want to do, you'll definitely do it. However, she doesn't spend much time explaining the exercises, doesn't talk about modifying them if this is your first ""Jillian"" dvd purchase and no where on the DVD does it say that you need a step.

I'm selling these to my gym. They'll use her workouts in the ""boot camps"" they hold for those that are in shape and want to increase the intensity.

Not for beginners... not a DVD that encourages you to get into shape or continue a fitness routine. I was discouraged and disappointed.",1225152000,2,1099,4.377450980392157

2384791,3,B000ACQXHW,"This Cardio Kickbox workout it best used as an addition to your other cardio and weight workouts.  It is a quick 20 minute workout that Jillian recommends using in the middle of the week to take a break from weight workouts.
I'm a 45 yr. old working mother with three kids.  I only have an hour in the morning to exercise/stretch/cooldown/shower so I was looking for something short but intense to help me lose these last 10 lbs.
I gave this 3 stars because I would prefer it to be 30-35 minutes. It's a little too short. I'm in pretty decent shape, but I do work up a sweat.  I feel that it doesn't work any particular muscle group intensely, but more of an all-over workout.  You work some on your obliques, your legs a bit, but nothing too intensly.  This is more of a cardio workout, as it says in the title.  I do like to use this in the middle of the week to break up harder workouts that use weights.  I also have her 30 Day Shred workout and use that at least two to three days/week.  That includes weights for the workout.
The other reason I gave it 3 stars is that she is a bit annoying in this.  She does a lot of giggling and even takes a break in the middle to put her hair back.  It seems like they started taping this and just went with the first take.  It's not as professional as some other tapes.  But, it you can get past that then it's an OK workout to use to give yourself a change of pace.",1223164800,3,1411,4.090909090909091

2384796,5,B000ACQXHW,"These workouts are hard and will give you your money's worth with great variety.  It does require the step and weights listed and it's hard to get by without them, so I would recommend investing in a good quality step and a set of weights that suit you.
  It is true that these tapes are hard if you are out of shape, but I recommend sticking with it. When I started using Jillian's tapes I was 183lbs.  I'm down to 155lbs after 3 months and I did that with the tapes and bettering my eating habits.  Do what you can and work your way up.  There was a time when I could do maybe half the steps the way she wanted me to, so I substituted other moves when I had to.  Now I can do it all.  It just takes time.  If you are really out of shape I don't know because even when I started I had a good range of motion and was able to move around for a while.
  But the bottom line is you get what it tells you you'll get and it works if you stick with it.  I'm still losing and more importantly my stamina is up and my body feels great.

I am very surprised with the DVD's. I've bought exercise videos in the past and never get past a few days. Jillians workout is NOT for beginners. I use 3lb weights and after three weeks I'm moving up to 5lbs in some of the exercises.

It's a 25 minute workout with warm-up. Test yourself and push yourself. You won't see the results if you don't put your all into it. I do one video a day before I go to work. After three weeks, I can a see a little change. I sweat more in a 25 minute period than I do using an eliptical at max heart rate for 60 minutes.

The first time I worked out to this DVD, every time I felt myself wanting to stop she seemed to know it and would tell me to keep going!

I resistance train seriously at the gym and so I am always trying to find strictly cardio (no ""toning,"" thanks) videos I can use at home on rest days.  This is one of the few videos I have found that really fits the bill.  It's higher intensity than most cardio videos I've encountered, the choreography is not ridiculous (I can only do so many step-touches and box steps, so I like that it's kickbox-based) and it's nice and short.  Plus, I love Jillian.  It's very hard to get me to do my cardio and so it is a credit to this video that I will often do it twice, back to back.  My only real complaint is that the music sucks.

2384804,5,B000ACQXHW,"I have used these for the past couple of weeks. I have done *TONS* of workout videos over the years (Jane Fonda, The Firm, Kathy Smith, Yoga, Biggest Loser, etc.) and I am a certified Body Pump Instructor.

I find this set to be great. Each video is about 25-30 minutes long. Jillian combines smaller muscle groups with larger ones - which produces better results in shorter periods of time.  When I finish a video I normally have achieved a 3.1 Training Effect with my Suunto heart rate monitor.

I have found these videos to be great. It is challenging and gives results. She seems to target muscle groups that are forgotten in a lot of other videos. Due to this I have already begun to see a changes in several parts of my body. I do warn you though this can be fairly brutal in parts and does require quick movements from floor to standing. I have found at times, (since I workout in a very small space) that if I need a few more moments to move my floor matt out of the way - its best to just pause the video for a few seconds - and then reset my space, and then go on.

Beginners I think would benefit from this set; however, they need to realize that it will be challenging. Start slowly, do as many reps as you can of the movements and just hang in there. If you can only do 5 out of the 30 reps, that's fine, just stick with it and keep doing it everyday. Eventually you will be able to do the whole thing. Exercise is not easy, but if you give it a chance you will end up a lot happier and healthier!!!

As with any exercise product, you will see results, but only if you STICK WITH IT and EAT HEALTHIER!!!

No video will change the way you look, unless you get them out of the package and actually use them - and this video if you do that will help you get the body you deserve.",1218153600,3,1789,4.097142857142857

Her nutrition guidelines and fitness programs are excellent!  This five-disc set provides very good workouts in a short amount of time, and you will start seeing a difference very soon.  I also recommend her books, which are geared to different fitness levels and goals.

One word of caution-- Jillian's workouts can be very intense.  I started too quickly into doing her high-impact program daily and injured my knee and back.  It really was a product of my fitness level, not her exercises, but I do encourage everyone to be careful.  She is so motivating that she makes you want to do it full-on and push through pain, but be sure to consider what shape you're in so you don't end up doing more harm than good.  I had to stop exercising for a while to recover, when I wish I just would have built up to the high impact moves slowly.

They combine a lot of exercises most people don't do together, (for example; lunges with bicep curl or jumping jacks with shoulder press).  It's an awesome workout and I think good for beginners or advanced individuals.  I don't like the fact it takes a good 10 minutes to get through the intro music and all that stuff but it's normal for any workout dvd.  I don't care who the instructors class is or anything she has to say.  I want to stick the video in and get to work instead of waiting around for her to say her piece.  That is the only thing I hate about the videos.  You definately need a step if you don't have one because she uses the step in all but one dvd.  Just a heads up for anyone looking to purchase these.  I'm glad there is no instruction to each exercise because you usually watch the video once anyways to see what it is all about and if you had to deal with that each time it would be aggravating.  So I like that she didn't put that into her video.  That is just my opinion, i just want to work out, who cares about who her workout crew is and all that other b.s. she talks about.

I was already a regular exerciser (doing around 5-7 hours of cardio/toning per week) but the first few times I did these DVDs I struggled a lot! They are now much easier to get through and I can see that my fitness has improved dramatically. Stairs are now a breeze!

Each DVD is under 30 minutes - it is easy to fast forward through the intro at the beginning of each one.  But they are quick, and effective.  I have quite an extensive collection of exercise DVDs - from Tae Bo to Pilates, to various Dance workouts and those ""10 minute"" deals.  But this set is the only one which gets my heart pumping in a really short amount of time.  Thanks to Jillian, now I have a huge collection of exercise DVDs just gathering dust!

Keep in mind, there is a lot of jumping, and she does move quickly from exercise to exercise without much direction as to what the next move is, but that's how she is able to squeeze so much in very little time.  And really once you have done it once, the DVDs are very easy to follow along.  The moves are easy, but very effective as you are not wasting a second of your time.

Combined with her ""30 day shred"" DVD (another AWESOME workout), I am finding my clothes are fitting better and are even getting too big on me!  I'm down from a size 6 to a size 4!  Being of pretty average build, I have struggled with getting more lean and cut, but these DVDs have really pushed me past that plateau and towards a really toned body.  No other DVD I own has given me such quick and effective results.

I am 20 years old, so this may not be a helpful workout to the older crowd, but I love this!  I just had a baby 6 months ago, and I have been trying to find some workout tapes that worked for me that didn't lose my attention.  I have been buying dancing exercise videos, and I saw this..it was a good price for 5 videos, so I got it.

There are pros and cons...

CONS- Most of the videos require you to get other exercise equipment, such as a (for lack of a better word), step.

Can not be done in a small room, a cluttered room, or a hard-wood floor.

Smokers will definitely not survive.

I would not recommend this video to someone over 45 or someone more than 40 lbs overweight.

I would not recommend this to anyone with bone/joint problems.

-Jillian gives NO BREATHING TIME at all, so you may have to pause this tape at first for breaths and drinks of water.

PROS

-I've only one this workout once, but I can tell you, I know it is going to be effective.

-This workouts muscles and is also cardiovascular

-The kickbox video is my favorite.  It works flexibility, along with lung ""strength"", tolerability to exercise, and muscle mass.

Overall, the only reason I didn't give this video 5 stars is because it requires other equipment and doesn't say so on the box.

I would definitely reccomend this to people trying to tone up, post-pregnancy, and people who have had experience in martial arts.

I would not reccomend this video for older people, people who never work out, or seriously obese people.",1210550400,3,1564,4.364583333333333

I got these videos hoping to get some definition.  Well...these video's rock. I have noticed a difference in only a week and a half.  These video's are definitely not for out of shape overweight people.  I struggle to get through them, but when you do...you feel so good about yourself!  She is tough.  She does constantly laugh in the video's which is kind of unprofessional and annoying but other than that..these are great videos that really push you to the edge.

I will use it as a pick me up workout for when I am short on time (not long at all) and after my circuit.  I don't understand why she says this workout should be done maybe once a week and then at the end says, ""See You Tomorrow.""  It can easliy be done a few times a week.  I wouldn't do this everyday.  It's not that an interesting of a workout and Jillian gets talky and sometimes silly.  She does have a phenomenal body and its a little endearing (or annoying) how she tries to act like the workout is hard for her.

Jillian herself does not workout but walk around the others to explain the workout. i would like to see her last through the workout. Other than that its a really good work out. For those who are looking for a tough challenging workout. There is no resting in between so you have to move quick and have everything ready. and I ercommend lots of workout space for a step platform and a mat beside it. you also need hand weights.",1208649600,2,652,4.266129032258065

2384842,2,B000ACQXHW,"With the hype about her TV show, I thought I'll give this one a try. I like kickboxing, but I should have known better, because I didn't like her weight workouts either when I tried them some time ago. It appears she gears toward overweight individuals that are out of shape, but there are many advanced exercisers out there that want good, fun, challenging and LONGER workouts because after a while exercise becomes addictive and no pep talk is needed. This one does get your heart rate up somewhat, but it's over before I feel that I got a real workout. I think it's only about 20 minutes at the most.  The rest on this DVD are testimonials, recipes, advice, etc. I just don't think it's worth the time and money when there are so much better choices out there.",1208390400,3,763,4.45

You'll really feel her workouts like no other.  Overall, great for shaping the back, abs, chest, shoulders, arms, legs and for aerobics - even if you skip her kickboxing DVD, you won't miss on aerobics since she integrates it in all of her body-shaping workouts.

But in my opinion, if your endurance and pain tolerance isn't high, it can enough to make you give up because the challenge is too great. But, maybe it's like she said, all a mind thing. You have to tell yourself you can do it, because you can. ??. The Cardio Kickbox is my favorite. I get a hard workout in about 30 min and it's doable. The other ones, I break up.

I read the box and individual DVD's when thay arrived but did not know until they began to play that they required weights (which I had) and an aerobic step (which I did not have). I improvised but felt that I was wasting my time not having the proper equipment.
The videos are tough but appear to gove a good workout so far. Not much warm up / cool down compared to some of the other videos I have done through Prevention. Overall I am excited about the results I expect to get from Jillian's intense work-outs. Dissappointing that she does not do the entire workout, but stops and walks around to make it more difficult for her team.",1207526400,2,721,4.348148148148148
2384849,4,B000ACQXHW,"While I think these DVDs are an excellent workout, I gave it 4 stars because it is NOT for a beginner.  She does have one of her group showing the ""beginner"" moves, but they are not modified enough in my opinion.  I know Jillian is known for her hard core discipline, but I cannot hang through the whole workout.  I have to take little breaks in the middle.  I will continue to use these until I can do the entire workout without stopping.  Also, I don't think there is enough explanation of the individual exercises.  She just goes from one thing to the next very quickly and assumes you know what the various moves are.  By the time I figured it out and got into the move, it was time to change to the next exercise.

I would recommend this, but just understand that it is a hard workout and you might have to work up to it.  It will kick your butt!",1207353600,2,851,4.171779141104294

2384854,3,B000ACQXHW,"As with any exercise video, it is important that you watch this one the whole way through at least once before you try doing it for the first time. This is especially important with Jillian Michael's Cardio Kickboxing, because she does not waste any time trying to show you how to do the moves. Nor does she emphasize proper form, for that matter, so I recommend you take some extra time the first time that you the workout, to do it slowly and make sure you are doing each move properly. Do not try to keep up right away, as you may injure yourself. (This is especially true if you have never done kickboxing before.)
 While this video was not as hard as I expected to get through the first time I did it, it seems to get almost more difficult each consecutive time. This video is HARDCORE and will have you sweating within the first 5-10 minutes, no matter your fitness level. It is definitely not for a beginner. I consider myself at intermediate level in my cardio, and this 30-minute workout is very difficult for me, to say the least. The only reason I gave this workout three stars instead of the four it would have otherwise received, is because it is very difficult, at times, to keep up with Jillian and her crew. As they begin a particular move, they are going at an even, measured pace. But often times, as the continue through the 10-30 reps they are doing, they start to go faster and faster. This only makes it harder to keep up with the video, especially if you are trying to sustain proper form. I recommend you keep a measured pace throughout each set of reps. Even if you are doing less reps than the people in the video, I think you will get better results and it will help to keep you from exhausting yourself too quickly. As you progress, you can pick up the pace a bit.
 On a more positive note, this video will definitely work your entire body, from head to toe, combining squats, punches, front back and side kicks, jumping jacks, plie hops, and more. I have already seen personal results from using this video on a once-weekly basis. It is a great way to shake up and intensify my usual workouts throughout the week. Cardio Kickboxing with Jillian Michaels will wipe you out, but with continued use, it will definitely be effective in toning your body, and increasing your cardio endurance.",1206662400,,2316,4.472813238770685
2384855,5,B000ACQXHW,"Several things attracted me to this set of DVD's.
One, the length of each DVD.  Having a busy schedule makes it difficult for me to get in much over 30 minutes for a work out... and each video runs about that long.
Two, diversity.  I'd rather not do the same routine every day... now I have a five day workout plan that is different every day.
Three, I wanted something that was fast paced... I really feel that I get a good work out in a short amount of time because you literally move the entire length of each DVD.
Four, the use of weights and an exercise step... I had both of those items collecting dust and was happy to be able to pull them out and start using them.
I know it sounds cheesy, but I also enjoy the pep talk at the end of each video.  She congratulates you for making it to the end, and talks about how hard it is but how worth it you are, and I like that she closes it with how she'll see you tomorrow... it seems very genuine and motivates me for the following day.
I would recommend this set because I enjoy it very much.",1206489600,2,1044,4.058252427184466

Anyway, this workout involves a simple warm-up, very basic moves, and then a cool-down. Again, I'm not saying the technique was bad. I'm just saying this was the type of video best used by a newby to the world of cardio kicboxing.",1206316800,3,486,4.34065934065934
2384858,1,B000ACQXHW,"After a few sessions, I'm motivated to break my TV, DVD player and the DVDs themselves, but not much else.

Michaels is great about setting a fast pace and making you work hard, but she gains that pace by completely failing to explain anything she's doing. So if you're someone who might injure yourself when you do something incorrectly in an attempt to recreate something you're seeing for the first time while being screamed at in high-pitched banter, don't bother.

Furthermore, Michaels is flat-out verbally abusive to the others in the video and the user. She's frequently yelling at others for not working hard enough while she's doing NOTHING AT ALL. If you're prone to throwing things when angry, put some kind of shield in front of breakable objects before you insert the DVD.

If your goal is to find the most annoying fitness video out there, this package has five of them, so it's a great bargain. If you're interested in finding a workout plan that you can stick to, that's easy to follow and low on mental torment, try something else. ANYTHING else.",1205884800,23,1064,4.7405405405405405

If you are just getting into kickboxing this would be a great video for you if you have been doing it for a while- go for something a little more challenging. I also bought Kickbox Strike Zone, but I haven't had a chance to try that one yet. I'll let you know how that one is, too. :)",1205280000,2,547,3.807017543859649
2384862,1,B000ACQXHW,"I have the maximize video set, and jillian's personality is obnoxious. She is not inspiring at all, but is narcissistic and rude. Her laugh is so annoying and she treats the viewers and her 'students' disrespectfully.

Some of the moves are unsafe and she does not explain how to perform them properly. The box also does not explain what equipment you need- a large (long) step, plus weights and surprise!! A floor mat too. She has you lying on your back for some moves and then jumping up right after to do something else and i feel like i am going to black out. Aren't you supposed to ""roll-up"" slowly to prevent dizziness?

On top of all this you have to listen to her annoying ""inspriational speech"" before each class. totally nauseating.

At the end of the day, it is not even a good workout. I don't feel sore afterward at all. It's pretty much a mediocre cardio workout.

I would not purchase any videos starring jillian again. I hate this video but do it because i spent the $23 and want to get my money's worth.",1205020800,8,1020,4.438502673796791

(You may get form tips from her book -- I haven't read it, so I don't know.) However, almost all of the exercises are classics, so most experienced exercisers should already know proper form. The thing I really like about these videos is that Jillian Michaels does stick to classics and really gives you a good workout with them.

At times, she moves so quickly, switching from weights, to steps, to the floor (etc) that it is hard to keep up--especially if you have limited space and have to move the step or switch to heavier weights. While I am a fan of the Biggest Loser, I actually found her a little annoying in these workouts. She seems to focus on herself, constantly talking about herself and what a tough trainer she  is. I usually only do 15 minutes at a time because that is all I can take of her.

2384878,2,B000ACQXHW,"I bought the box set, expecting (like everyone else) a fast-paced gruelling workout.  I was most excited about Cardio Kickbox...and also most disappointed after the workout.

Negatives:
Too short of a workout

Always stopping between reps - cardio kickbox should have a constant flow, but Jillian would literally stop between EVERY exercise to explain the next one.  Meanwhile, everyone just STANDS around with their hands in their pockets.  I couldn't keep my heartrate up because she kept stopping.

No Combos - cardio kickbox should have combinations and should work arms and legs at the same time.  But when Jillian has you do a set of 10 side kicks, it's just 10 sick kicks.  There's a decent pause between kicks, long enough to throw in a good cross punch, but she doesn't bother.

""Fake"" Exasperation: for some reason, Jillian spends the entire video acting like she's dying, like the workout is SO hard.  But it's not hard.  Not only that: who wants an exercise teacher that constantly WHINES about the level of difficulty?  Not me.  I want her to make it look easy, to inspire me to get to her level.  Instead, you end the session feeling duped into believing you had the toughest workout ever.

Positives:
To make the workout worthwhile, i suggest adding shuffle steps between all of her reps, and creating your own combos of kicks, knees, and punches to elevate the level of difficulty and maximize your workout.

Suggestions:
I would suggest that Jillian go to ANY local gym across the country and participate in a basic 50 minute ""cardio kickboxing"" class, so that maybe then she'll realize how sad her own video looks in comparison.

Recommended for:
someone who has never taken a cardio kickbox class before and doesn't realize that this is not it.

EDIT: I have tried her Front/Back discs and I would rate them at 4 stars.  They're fast-paced, challenging, and keep your heart rate up and your body sweating.  It's great to have a strength training workout that invovles cardio as well - I felt like I was working out for a lot longer than I was.  And you can modify it to be as hard as you want (with heavier weights).

I would still like to see a much longer workout though.  I hate how it seems like every workout video you buy today is less than 30 minutes.  What's the point?",1202688000,4,2296,4.668329177057356

These are challenging workouts where not everything is obtainable right off the bat and it gives you something to work towards.  I like to workout at home on the nights it's to cold to go to the gym or I am in a time crunch.

They are only 30 minute workouts but you will sweat and get fit in no time!",1201219200,,276,4.288461538461538
2384886,3,B000ACQXHW,"After reading the other reviews of this product, I still decided to buy it.  Unfortunately, I think that I could have spent the money on a better exercise DVD.  The workout is 25 minutes long which is kind of nice when you don't have a lot of time, but there is also only one workout included on the DVD.

I was expecting Jillian to act like she acts on The Biggest Loser, but she starts laughing at some points and even whines that the workout is hard.  When one of the people behind her says ""that's it?"" at the end of the workout, she makes everybody do a few more exercises and then at the end of the workout, complains to the woman that she said that.  I was able to make it through the entire workout (and it is a good 25 minute workout) so it wasn't THAT difficult.

I also didn't like the camera work.  A number of times they focus in too much on the upper body of Jillian...but when she is doing leg stuff.  They should have panned out to show her entire body and what she is doing.

I did like the fact that we went through the exercises quickly and kept our heart rate up.  I do have to say that I own The Biggest Loser workout with Bob and I like that DVD better.  It has a number of workouts and seems to be better produced.",1200960000,,1237,4.049382716049383

That doesn't mean I don't get a workout anymore from them.  I Do! I'm really glad I got the whole set. There is one I do less than the others but I still mix it in too. I love how down to earth she is and yet tough at the same time.  She can make you smirk in the middle of a workout and therefor keeps you going.,1200441600,,618,3.6742424242424243

If I could be guaranteed The Biggest Loser workout videos would only have Jillian and Bob, I would have bought those too, but JM all by herself? Working out, giving pep talks, yelling in that special JM way. yeah. I can't resist. The workouts are really nice, they are a bit on the short side, most around 30 minutes, so if you want a solid hour workout you'll be doing two vids. Even if you only do one you'll feel it, but not feel like you've been murdered (Tae Bo, or that you can't keep up). Overall FANTASTIC! Please make more! Jillian rules!",1200182400,2,705,4.268656716417911
2384890,3,B000ACQXHW,"This is the first workout DVD I've ever used.  I'm a 20-something who has spent the last 3 months trying to shed some extra weight and get back in shape after a few years of sheer laziness.  I am now in average shape.  I just worked up to 30 minutes of running with no breaks, to give you an idea of my level of fitness--I haven't even gotten above a 3 mile run yet.  I exercise about 4-5 times per week including cardio, weights, and circuit training and I enjoy a tough workout.

So I was expecting to get my booty kicked when I popped in Jillian's cardio kickboxing DVD this weekend.  Unfortunately, I can't say it worked.  I was able to follow along easily enough and felt that my form was fine.  I timed the workout and it is just over 20 minutes, not including the stretching at the end.  By the end, my heart rate hadn't gone much above 140--compare that with 150-170 during my usual cardio workouts (I wear a monitor).  Did I break a sweat?  Yeah.  Did I burn some calories?  Sure.  But when someone in the video said ""That's all?"" at the end of the workout to kid around with Jillian, I had to agree.  I ended up running on the treadmill for 15 minutes afterward just to feel as if I'd gotten in a good workout for the day.  This was supposed to be a heavier cardio day for me, but ended up feeling light.

The exercises were relatively easy and very repetitive.  You do the same 5-6 exercises (side kicks, front kicks, jumping jacks, pretend jump rope, back to front kicks, knee/elbow raises, punches) with a couple of variations over the course of the 20 minutes.  Maybe this is par for the course with workout videos; as I said this is the first one I've tried so I'm not sure if that's normal.  The part that really got me was the punching Jillian did in between many of the exercises.  She instructs you to get into a squat position and punch the air for about 30 repetitions.  This is supposed to be aerobically challenging?  I got lower and punched harder to see if I was missing something, and noticed my heart rate dropping...dropping...

All in all, I found the cardio kickboxing DVD disappointing.  I was hoping for a tough cardio workout from this self-proclaimed tough girl.  I didn't get one.  I might use this video occasionally to mix up my routine, but I get the feeling it'll mostly be collecting dust on top of the DVD player.

Edited to add: I was finally able to get an aerobic step and tried the Shape Up--Back workout yesterday for the first time.  I will admit that this one was much more challenging than the Cardio Kickbox workout!  However, it's still just over 20 minutes, not including the cool down/stretching, so I still feel the need to work out for an additional 15-20 minutes when I'm done with the DVD.  I am guessing I'll feel the same about the remaining three DVDs in the series, which I have yet to try but look very similar to Shape Up--Back.

The good news is that the price of these DVDs can't be beat.  If they were more expensive I think I would be much more disappointed, but for $15 plus free shipping, it's hard to complain much.

So if you're a beginner or in average shape and looking for a decent 20 minute video, you can get some use out of these.  But if you're looking for something really tough, you may have to add this on to your usual routine to create a full workout.",1200182400,3,3334,4.339805825242719
2384891,3,B000ACQXHW,"I bought this set of 5 dvd as I had liked the kickboxing workout I had already tried.
But... I have to admit that the quality of these dvds is quite bad: bad music, bad cam angles. Music is important in a sport workout to keep the motivation going. And what to say about the bad angles? Well, it's really bad. Sometimes you just can't see the moves they are doing, as the cam stays on the face of the teacher. OK, she is really pretty, but hey, we want to see the moves so we can do it too at the same time!
Anyway, out of the 5 dvd, I only just use 2 : the kickboxing workout and the maximize full frontal.
The first two dvd ""shape up front"" and ""shape up back"", I just don't find them motivating enough, quite boring shall I say.
And the last one, ""Maximize back in action"" is ok, but too arsh on my knees.

2384904,2,B000ACQXHW,"I'll begin with the positive: this workout keeps your heart rate up and isn't too long for those individuals like myself that don't like to do cardio.

Negatives: too many!  I was shocked at how poor the counting was in this workout.  I would even start the exercise movement as soon as Jillian mentioned it and still be on #9 when they would count to #10.  I consider myself an advanced exerciser and will often do my movements faster to fit in more of a workout.  This is not the case with this DVD, the counting is completely unacceptable.

Next, Jillian herself forgets more than once what the next movement is.  That is completely unprofessional and shows she did not put any thought into creating the video and did it clearly for the money.

Lastly, she flirts with/teases the guys and girls more than necessary that it leaves you standing there waiting for her to start the next exercise.

I think if you watched this DVD a few times you'd be able to do these exercises without the DVD and while watching TV instead.

i'm probably going to get electrocuted from sweating all over my laptop. ick.

i couldn't finish the frigging disc. got halfway through and basically wound up with Tourrette's Syndrome and the beginning of a stroke.

I'd bought a Reebok Step platform thing about an hour or so ago. Set it up in the living room. Strapped on the Sports Booby Catcher and my sweatpants and turned on the dvd.

Oh, and there's a chick on this dvd named Erin, so Jillian keeps yelling ""Come on, Erin! Do it!""

Actually, I like this DVD. this Jillian is a hardass and not some perky twit that's all bubbly.

I am in pretty good shape and I was tired when I got done.  I love doing them on days when I'm short of time because I know I'll burn just as many calories during Jillian's workouts as I would the longer ones.

Jillian Michaels is a tough trainer, but motivates you to keep going.

First of all, since this is a workout with basic moves like jumping jacks and jump ropes (minus a real jump rope), Jillian's mediocre cuing doesn't matter that much. You can easily catch on after the first time. The moves are very simple...punches, jumping jacks, jump ropes, fast feet, front kicks, back kicks, shallow lunges. The workout is short but very effective because she doesn't slow down to teach you moves that don't need to be taught! Yes, Jillian does act a bit obnoxious and demanding, but I like that. It's a nice change from the usual smiley Barbie types. Besides, Jillian's body and life story (which she shares at the beginning of the DVD) are quite inspiring. This DVD is a good one to pull out when you're short on time but want a tough cardio workout to get you going. Definitely worth adding to your fitness collection.",1180224000,5,915,4.654320987654321

It doesn't seem like you'd be able to get much out of a 30 minutes, light weight workout, but once you try it you'll believe it.  I anticipate using these workouts a lot, especially when I don't have a lot of time.  I don't care for some of the silliness, but if that can be overlooked, I'd highly recommend these workouts.

2384941,4,B000ACQXHW,"If you like Jillian Michaels from what you've seen on The Biggest Loser, chances are you'll like this DVD box set.  The workouts are short, sharp, and hard (definitely not for beginners) and punctuated by Michaels' cut-to-the-chase personality.  The team behind her look like they're having a great time, and the spontaneous banter is quite entertaining.

The down sides: there is very little instruction on proper technique and form, so you will probably need to either be well-versed in the exercise techniques or have to do some quick reseach; the person doing the beginner version is not always visible, which can be problematic at times; the music and the exercises are not in synch (I wondered if the tracks had been added later as they seem to have little bearing on the workouts themselves), so you need to keep your eyes on the screen at first if you want to keep up with the team; and you will need a step and some hand weights to do the workouts.

The up sides: these workouts are intense and will really get you moving, and Jillian is a motivational and entertaining instructor who provides plenty of interesting exercises and has a great outlook on health and fitness.  Although the workouts themselves barely touch 30 minutes, you can flick back to the beginning of each section and do them again if you want to increase the length.  (You'll probably be too shattered the first time, though!)

All in all, if you're a seasoned exerciser who is looking for a kick in the butt, I definitely recommend these DVDs as a way to mix up your workouts at home.",1173312000,3,1565,4.669090909090909

2384943,5,B000ACQXHW,"I've been doing this workout since January (about 5x/week). Since it's only 20 minutes of cardio, I use hand weights to make the most of the workout (just for the punches and jumping jacks, at first 3lbs, and now 5lbs). I have seen awesome results. I haven't lost much weight, but my clothes fit much better and I've lost the flab under my arms and the cellulite on the back of my legs. I suggest doing about 10 minutes (total) of pushups and lunges/squats at least 2x/week after the video.",1172534400,3,490,4.455555555555556
2384944,3,B000ACQXHW,"I think Amazon is lumping together all of the reviews for the entire series whether you are looking up the box set or an individual volume, which can be confusing. So this review is specifically for the ""cardio kickboxing"" volume, which I bought by itself.

First,THIS volume does NOT require weights or a step bench (though I don't see why you couldn't do it with small hand weights for a little ""extra"" work).

Why 3 stars?  Because I don't think as an individual volume it deserves the generally 4-5 star reviews other volumes or the series as a whole seem to be getting.  It was OK, but it won't be one of my favorites.

PROS: Some things others found to be cons were actually good for me. It *is* repetitive and doesn't have a huge variety--I know many more moves from doing Tae Bo and other DVDs.  But, I'm really a clod and I get very frustrated when routines get complicated or add on too fast. (So for example, even though Billy Blanks ""tricks"" you sometimes, I always know he does sets of 8 and combos with no more than about 3 things.)  If you are not very coordinated and just want to get some exercise without having to think, you can burn right through this (though as others have written, beware if you have joint problems!). I am not very athletic and do not work out religiously, but I picked up on the ""routine"" quickly and my heart rate was certainly up.  I found it neither too hard nor too easy, but if you've been a couch potato for a long time, you're going to be panting.

CONS: I agree with the people who were annoyed by the music not quite synching to the group's pace, and those who write the group needs to count out loud better. Since there was a lot of repetition, I often looked away from the TV, listened to the music, and paced myself to that until I heard them stop.  The music was OK, but not very varied and didn't get me too excited.  I was hoping for a more challenging muscle workout. I didn't feel a lot of ""good burn"" like I do when I do my Tae-Bo  routines, and didn't feel much of anything in my abs. There are some squats and lunges, but I had to slow down to my own pace to get something out of them or else I was just sort of bobbing to keep up (but that's me, the clod, again).  Finally, a little more variety would have been nice. I don't mind doing all of the reps, but the whole time there were about half a dozen moves over and over--as other people have commented, it isn't really what the title implies.

So, I see this as filling a niche in my exercise: it's some decent cardio, so if the weather is too yucky for a jog, if I'm sore from harder DVDs, and/or if I want something that goes by quickly and doesn't require my concentration--if I just need some exercise but am not 100% mentally of physically--I can see myself reaching for this.

My verdict: if you can get it used or cheap, consider it as a filler for your collection; otherwise, there is better stuff out there.",1172361600,18,2931,4.255855855855856

I wanted something that would make me sweat fast, but that I could do any time at home.  This video pretty much fit the bill, but my complaints are these: The routines are a bit too repetitive and, hence, boring.  While I didn't want anything too choreographed, this goes to the opposite extreme--you do, for example, thirty punches over and over, then 10 side kicks on each side, then thirty seconds of ""fast feet"", and so on.  Also, what they call ""uppercuts"" are different from anything I had done in kickboxing class, and they don't do roundhouse punches at all.  The instructor is really goofy and (to me, anyway) kind of annoying. There are a lot of jumping jacks and a lot of jumping rope (without the rope).  In short, this is a brisk calisthenics workout with punches and kicks for good measure (and a ditzy instructor), but if you are expecting a kickboxing workout with interesting and mentally challenging moves, this really isn't it.",1168300800,2,1219,4.6157407407407405

This feels more like a boot camp than an aerobic-style class.  I found this one to be a bit boring, as compared to some other kickbox videos that I own. (e.g. Kathy Smith - Kickboxing Workout).

This video is probably good for a beginner that wants a little variety in their workout, but it is too slow for an intermediate level workout. It would be helpful if the industry would ""rate"" their videos with an intensity level.

I really feel good after doing these workouts & I would recommend these to anyone willing to get their butt kicked.",1165622400,5,667,3.9477611940298507

2384968,5,B000ACQXHW,I recently returned to work full-time after having my second child and found I had little time left to myself.  I needed a workout that could be done in 30 minutes or less so I ordered this 2-Disc package and decided to give it a shot.  I am so glad I did.  Since I was very active the weeks following my child's birth (exercising 40-60 minutes 6 days a week) I was worried such a short workout would not be enough to challenge me.  I was wrong.  Both workouts are very fast-paced and effective.  I am completely drenched in sweat when I complete each one and I feel strong and energized - just what I need to get me through the day.  Plus I like Jillian's no-nonsense attitude and how she pushes you to your limits and beyond.  I highly recommend this DVD set for anyone who wants to get great results in the minimum amount of time.,1160956800,11,833,4.227848101265823
2384969,4,B000ACQXHW,"I love cardio kickboxing, so of course I had to try my favorite workout guru, Jillian Michaels', new cardio kickbox DVD!  I went through it once and was sweating, so I decided that 30 minutes just wasn't enough for me and went through it again!  I had to get a towel, I was that sweaty!  A great, easy to follow cardio workout that can easily be done without any extra workout tools...no weights, steps, resistance bands required...just your body and your energy!  Jillian suggests doing this workout once per week in the middle of the week to break up resistance training, however I think it's a great before-work...don't have time to go to the gym workout to get motivated for the day.  I agree with some of the other reviewers...the music could be much better and the workout could be much longer!  The downloadable exercise logs are a great bonus.  However, the 3 recipes are a little lacking!",1160784000,7,897,4.639240506329114

Jillian specifically has someone doing a modified easier version so whenever I was getting really tired I followed what that person was doing instead.

This was a good 20-30 minute cardio workout and I think it'll be good for me both as a beginner and as I get into better physical shape. I definitely recommend this for first-timers like me.",1160352000,7,502,4.397849462365591
2384971,5,B000ACQXHW,"I have been a Tae Bo fan for years. To introduce some variety into my workout routine, I tried Jillian's Cardio Kickbox Workout.  Because I am used to working out for at least 40 minutes, I go through Jillian's Cardio Kickbox routine 2X.  By the end of the first run-through (about 25 minutes), I am sweating. After going through the routine twice, I am soaking wet and feel like I've had a great cardio workout.  There are a few things I had to get used to.  First, the music serves merely as background.  You do not match your moves to the beat and this was a bit annoying to me at first.  I got over it.  Second, I find some of Jillian's stances awkward ( roundhouse kicks beginning from a stationary position), and find myself much more comfortable using the Tae Bo form for some of the moves. What I really LOVE about the workout is that Jillian always lets you know how many reps you are going to do and she always does exactly what she says. (Tae Bo fans will know that Billy isn't always that reliable!) When I start to get tired, I tell myself I can do anything for 10, 20 or 30 reps, and I make it through every time.  Jillian incorporates a lot of jab-cross punching, and I can feel it in every muscle in my abdomen.  With a Tae Bo background, I find all of Jillian's moves easy but very effective. When I run through her routine twice, I sweat a LOT more than I do with ANY Tae Bo video, and feel a lot more tired when I'm done.  An excellent cardio, muscle-toning, challenging, fun workout.",1159920000,30,1503,4.26056338028169

I got the one minute workout (Minna Lessig) for the same price and find it a lot more interesting.

The positives - these routines will make you sweat but are not for those with weak joints as many exercises place pressure on knees/ankles (lunges, jumping jacks, jumping kicks etc).",1157414400,20,610,4.389380530973451

Same gym, pretty much the same people, and very similar exercises and music. I bought the box set because I wanted to do a short workout in the mornings before going to work 5 days a week, but there is no way I can do these tapes every day as they can become monotonous.

I think having the back and the front is enough. The rest is just the same.",1147996800,18,502,4.02
2384977,5,B000ACQXHW,"I loved Jillian on the show, her personality, and that's why I bought her workout DVD's.  Home workout DVD's are tough...either the music's bad, the instructor's bad, or the workout's bad and it's hard to stay motivated.  There's very few home workout video's I like - I can't stand whiney, squeaky voices, cheesy music, and the feeling that I'm not really working out hard.  I think if you really like the instructor it goes a long way towards making the workout good for you.  I think Jillian's awesome and these workout's are no nonsense straight in to it hard working out.  I think they're about 35 minutes each, but I don't know because I'm so tired and beat after about 20 minutes, I have to stop working out.  And that's a GOOD thing.  I really feel like I've worked out.  I'm sore and I'm TIRED since she keeps the heart rate up while also doing muscle building exercises.  It's good stuff!

It's also good because I'm trying to start working out consistently again and when I get the ""uuugh...I don't feel like working out"" thing going in my head, I just tell myself ""Yea, but you know now it'll be over in like 20 minutes and you'll feel beat and you'll know you really did some good stuff!""

It'd be nice if it had some hard core music with a good beat in the background just to help, but honestly, I'm working so hard to do the exercises and keep up that I don't even notice the music!

One note - if you're not ""experienced"" with exercises and working out, you do need to buy a more beginner tape to learn the correct way to do exercises to make sure you're working the muscles correctly.  You need to know what you're doing if you get these DVD's cuz she goes right in to it and starts workin ya.

They're good workout DVD's, I'm really enjoying them :0)",1147737600,23,1768,4.36697247706422
2384978,4,B000ACQXHW,"For the last 6 months, I have been trying to get into shape and lose a few pounds. Before, I was totally out of shape and 20 pounds heavier. I bought Jillian's DVDs because I was looking to add some variety to my workouts.

Even though I have been working out for about 6 months, I would not say I am in great shape. I'm just beginning, and only recently have I noticed I don't huff and puff when going up a flight of stairs or struggling to carry our heavy garbage bags to the curb. But I am not ready for a triathlon by any stretch of the imagination!

I usually avoid workout tapes because I am extremely uncoordinated and spend so much time figuring out how and when to do the moves that I never break a sweat. Not a problem with this DVD! Jillian's workouts are simple (squats, kick and punch drills, jumping jacks), that I have never had a problem following her. And after 5 minutes I was sweating! I can walk for two hours and only break a light sweat. With this DVD, sweat was pouring off of me!

Still, while it is challenging to me (and other beginners, I'm sure), I doubt this would be enough for a seasoned exerciser. Those who say it's too tough for beginners might need to build up their stamina a bit, but really, workouts are supposed to be tough, otherwise they are useless. If you've never exercised before, try this for 5 minutes at a time, work up to the full 30. Really, I'm sure most beginners will be able to do the entire 30 minutes within a few weeks of dedicated work.

I found Jillian to be engaging and fun. I find that I hate the rah-rah cheerleader-type instructors, but I also don't like the instructors that take everything so seriously that it saps all fun out of a workout. Jillian seems to strike a nice balance between up-beat encouragement, and fun, fly-by-the-seat-of-her-sweats spontaneity. Her laughing did not bother me, but I can see how it might bother others.

This is not a 5 star review, because I think the DVD is a bit skimpy for the price. For the price, I would expect at least 45 minutes of workout time, rather then the half-hour here. A nice addition would have been a second 30 minute workout. Also, the stretching portion is quite skimpy, and the warm-up ramps up a bit too quick for my taste. A minor niggle too, is the fact that she does not ""mirror"" the viewer. She calls out, ""now for your right leg!"" and then lifts her own right leg. It is much easier to follow instructors when they mirror, rather then use the same side as the viewer. It's minor, but annoying nonetheless. The ""extras"" on this DVD are hardly extra, and you need a computer to access a few of them. Other than that, I found this to be a fun DVD that gets me sweating, and one I look forward to doing each week.",1146614400,36,2739,4.310679611650485

To the beginners out there who might be unsure about purchasing these DVD's, they are hard, they will kick your butt and they will push you, but if you want a DVD that will really challenge you and get you to sweat i would recommend it.

I only gave this 4 stars because you do need some additional equiptment (an aerobic step and hand weights), the workouts are only 30 minutes long (but you do get a good sweat going) and i personally don't really like the people doing the workouts along side Jillian, but i think everything else is fantastic!",1146182400,7,798,4.348993288590604

She uses squats, jumping jacks, jump roping, kicks and some light jabbing to really get your heart rate up.  Believe me - after 20 minutes, you'll be sweating.

HOWEVER, it's a very boring 20 minutes because she doesn't do any combos, drills or combats.  It might just be a personal preference, because what I really like about kickboxing is combining the upper body moves (jabs, upper cuts, hooks, elbows and blocking) with lower body moves (front kicks, scissor kicks, side kicks, roundhouse) - this video doesn't have any of that.",1144972800,6,653,4.803571428571429

I've given this product 4 stars because I believe in the effectiveness of the workouts, however, the way the DVD is done has its flaws. As some have mentioned the sessions lack a well defined structure and Jillian does get annoying with that awful forced laugh of hers. There is also plenty of jumping around which can turn into a problem if you live on a second floor.

If you are a beginner, like me, you may want to try Bob Harper's Biggest Looser workout DVD. I found that one better suited to get me started. After breaking my gears in with that workout I hope to come back and revisit Jill's.",1141862400,8,863,4.490445859872612

I'm sorry to say that I'm a little disappointed.  The overall workout is great.  She really gets your heart rate up and you really feel the burn in the muscles that you are working.  But what kills it for me is that she keeps laughing for no reason.  It's like she's never been on TV before.  At first, you kind of blow it off.  But after awhile it's nerve wrecking.  I'm not saying that you have to be super serious while you're working out.  You should enjoy yourself, but her constant laughing kind of makes me sick.",1141084800,26,694,4.181818181818182

So just when you think you can't do anymore, you're done. These combine cardio bursts with strength moves to keep your heart rate up and provide maximum calorie burn.

Of course weight loss requires vigorous excercise, but if you are obese or very out of shape doing too much too soon can be dangerous. also, i didn't like when one of her people messed up an excercise, she adds another rep for everyone (including the viewer)!! whatever! i didn't mess up, and my weight loss is not a team effort!! i will say she was very encouraging and spoke very candidly about her own weight loss, although i grew sick of hearing about every time i put the dvd on.",1140652800,5,1200,4.244541484716157

This is my 1st DVD I buy -ever( I don't regularly do sports and I am a bit overweight), it was tough hard to keep up, but there is a beginner version.
It makes u sweat from beginning till end...

It can be done and I'm losing weight just like all of Jillian's teams.  Her workout is so much more involved than the Biggest Loser Workout.  She pushs and challenges you the entire time.  Just make sure you modify it to your specific needs.  I have tried both workouts and this one is better in my opinion.  I've lost more weight while doing Jillian's.

As stated before, the videos are about 30 minutes long each and you will begin to sweat within the first 30 seconds and continue till the end.

Well worth the money they cost.  Hats off to Jillian Michaels, she pushes you hard, tells you to not hit the pause button seemingly at all the times you want to, yet still manages to act like a friend and makes you feel accomplished.

I agree with the other posts points as to why he gave a 4 out of 5, there were sometimes she would start an exercise calling it by name (me not knowing what it was) and I had to wait untill the video showed someone doing it untill I could join in, this should clear up after a few viewings though.  Not Jillian is not always doing the exercises herself, but this enables her to be there and be supportive, so I see the point.

Take it from the guy whos never really been active before; this will do it.  The times flys by and you feel better afterwards.",1138406400,10,1122,4.0590909090909095

2385046,4,B000ACQXHW,"I am happy with my purchase. Each workout is roughly 30 minutes each. They are broken down into a warm up, two different routinues using upper and lower body together with cardio, and a cool down/stretch. The cardio is a lot of jumping (think jumping jacks, etc.) What I really like about the workouts is that they are time efficient. I feel like I got a workout in 30 minutes and she combines upper and lower boday together. Maybe I'm crazy but I am starting to see a difference after 7 workouts. If you liked Jillian on the Biggest Loser, you'll like her on the DVDs. Her personality is the same.

Why I gave the DVDs 4: There are no demos of the exercises, so if you are not familiar with the exercises in her book (Winning By Losing) you might want to watch the DVDs before you do them or to see what the modified version of the exercise is. I believe she mentions that in the intro as well. Also, there a lot of jumping. I read in another person's review that that can be bad for joint problems, so something to consider.

Surprisingly, even though it was very intense and I felt that I got an excellent workout, it left me more energized than when I started- which doesn't happen too often for me. So I'm running out right now to buy the front side DVD version of this.  Jillian is very motivating, and the fast-paced tempo makes this workout fly by before you get a chance to want to stop.

The Maximize Full Frontal DVD is a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Front DVD; it has more core work, more one-leg moves and the cardio segments always use dumbbells. The Maximize Back In Action DVD is also a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Backside DVD; it has more core work, harder exercises and additional power moves. All 4 DVDs are an excellent buy and since they are all short workouts, you can easily combine them with cardio for a well-rounded 60 minute workout.

On the 2nd Week: Day1 is Jillian Michaels Maximize Full Frontal and 30 mins.cardio, Day2 is Jillian Michaels Back in Action plus 30 mins. cardio and alternate them again for one whole week.

Lately, I've had the ""problem"" of having gotten so much more fit that raising my heart rate into the cardio zone is often quite difficult to do.

I poked around online, did some research, and ordered this due to its glowing reviews. It's amazing. No fancy moves, but if you keep pace with the trainers on screen (which ain't easy, I'll tell you!), you will sweat and your heart will POUND. 25 minutes very well spent.
