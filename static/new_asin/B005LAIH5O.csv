4730009,3,B005LAIH5O,"Clash of the Titans was an okay remake that could have been great, but the trailers for Wrath of the Titans looked to be a huge improvement and in some cases it was.

From the Kraken to Kronos. Hades decides to join side Kronos to destroy the world and thus securing his immortality, but first he needs all the power Zeus contains to restore his daddy to his past glory. Perseus catches word of this and is on a mission to save his father, Zeus, and fights all kinds of creatures along the way.

The CGI is excellent this time around and there are far fewer corny moments. Even the acting seemed less forced, though still pretty average. Seeing this in IMAX 3-D was worth the extra money. It was fully shot in this format so the images were crystal clear and it made you feel you were actually in the movie, along with the usual random objects being shot towards your face.

Wrath of the Titans is pure mindless action with little need for dialogue or a well thought out story, but it is a fun movie to watch. Heck, I wouldn't mind seeing a third film in the series.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1333152000,64,1092,4.235576923076923
4730010,4,B005LAIH5O,"This is not by any means a bad film in fact it is better then most movies i have seen in recent years. Do not pay the 3D price for the movie because the 3D does nothing special to enhence the movie. See it in 3D only if you are a die hard fan of 3D films. The movie opens up with sam worthington and the boy who plays his son the film picks up real quick and the action does not stop. My only real com
plant about the movie was i was kind of hoping for a longer battle scene bewteen the mahkai army and the human army. There is a battle scene they do show it happening but if you want a battle scene like lord of the rings return of the king or the two towers then you will be somewhat disappointed. All in all this film is worth watching and buying when it comes out on dvd. You do not have to watch the first movie as it does not follow the first movie that close there are things mentioned in this movie that happened in the clash of the titans but it still does not follow the first movie that close",1333065600,,1003,3.8502415458937196
4730011,3,B005LAIH5O,"Then you'll probably like this one.
I'll keep it short and free of spoilers.
I really liked the first one.
I thought it paid acceptable homage to the original while updating things.
That said the original suffered from its share of issues.
Namely horrible dialog, some pretty bad acting from everyone but Fiennes and Neeson.
A plot that jumped around too much.
It was a huge CGI fest but it was still a fun movie.
This movie is pretty much the same thing only with better acting.
It still has a story without any real emotion behind it.
The FX are outstanding.
Neeson and Fiennes of course steal the show as always.
I have to give the edge to Hades (Fiennes), his hair rules.
Kidding.
The story really needed more than an hour and a half to properly develope.
I hope the DVD has an extended version.
Is it worth seeing in the theaters?
Of course.
The theater is the BEST place to see a movie like this.
It's fun.
It's mindless.
It doesn't try too hard to be anything life altering.
It's just a good old fashioned summer popcorn movie.

4730012,3,B005LAIH5O,"It'd be difficult to approach Wrath of the Titans with a completely open mind. The film it follows, Clash of the Titans, was dull and almost single-handedly began the downfall of 3D in the US. Those low expectations though may actually be an advantage for Wrath. Though flawed it's an entertaining film with some spectacular special effects. Even more surprising - the 3D is worthwhile and enhances the experience.

The story follows Perseus (Sam Worthington) who must travel into the underworld to rescue his father Zeus (Liam Neeson). Zeus' other son Ares (Edgar Ramirez) has turned on him and handed him over to Hades (Ralph Fiennes). The plan is to sap Zeus' powers and transfer them to the leader of the imprisoned Titans - Kronos - (father to Zeus, Hades, and Poseiden) who would then unleash hell on the world.

Where the negativity towards Clash really makes an impact is in the early minutes of Wrath. There is no real emotional attachment to the characters - no real care for their fates or the conflicts that are at hand. I wasn't sure the film would be able to break out of that but it somehow did despite inherent confusion around their relationships and motivations without having Clash's plot fresh on the mind. It just took a little time for it to come together.

Wrath of the Titans isn't going to win any awards for dialogue which is sketchy to say the least and almost laughable at times. In fact the movie tends to just move from one set piece to the next with the story taking a back seat. The action is what ties it all together and ultimately leads into a massive final battle. It was actually somewhat startling just was how brisk the pace was and how quickly events advanced - by the time that battle came around it didn't feel as though it was already time for the film to be concluded.

That is a compliment as the first film was plodding and anything but an enjoyable experience. The effects in Wrath are extraordinary and the uniqueness of the various monsters, and the sheer size of Kronos, adds to the fun. While I rarely would recommend paying extra for 3D - and I still wouldn't necessarily with Wrath - there were some really cool moments that were taken advantage of with the technology and it added some valuable depth to scenes. All things being equal going with the 3D wouldn't be a bad decision here.

Wrath of the Titans achieved something unanticipated - it entertained and even made the prospect of a third film in the series somewhat appealing. Expectations, albeit very low, were easily exceeded. There are better overall options in theaters right now (21 Jump Street, The Hunger Games) but for the crowd seeking action Wrath of the Titans is worth considering.",1332979200,69,2705,4.662473794549266

The Hades character remains interesting, and there wasn't much further development of the Perseus character. Ditto for the Zeus character. The major villain must have been up for fodder, as Kronos appeared in both this and the Percy Jackson movie, almost looking the same too. The monsters lacked the appeal of the Kracken. And there was much less character development in this one than that last. So it was only OK.

Oh yeah...the Ares character -- seriously...no development whatsoever of his character than an angry brat.",1489449600,,616,5.03921568627451

4731076,3,B005LAIH5O,"Preparing myself to review Wrath of the Titans was like
preparing for a bad homework assignment that one would
hope to find any excuse not to do.  After all, this is the
sequel to Clash of the Titans, which was poorly received
by critics in 2010 and then had the misfortune of becoming
the poster child for the worst post-unconverted 3D film ever
made.

Going into my review of Wrath of the Titans, I knew history
could very well be repeating itself once more.  Once again,
here was a film that was not critically well received and
whose 3D was done entirely in postproduction.

However, once you actually sit in your favorite home theater
chair and begin to take in this film, you find something rather
remarkable has happened.  This time around, there seems to
be a sense of a coherent storyline.  The pacing is better thanks
to a seemingly endless string of action scenes and outstanding
effects that makes the film's 98 minutes seem well-timed.

Wrath of the Titans picks up 10 years after the first film. Since
defeating the Kraken, Perseus (Sam Worthington), the half-human
son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), lives as a simple fisherman bringing
up a family.  It has become a time where people have stopped
praying to the Gods, and as such, their work has become undone.
It is these faithless times that have allowed Hades (Ralph Fiennes)
and Ares (dgar Ramrez) to join forces and imprison Zeus while
they unleash Kronos to destroy the remaining Gods.

When Perseus witnesses the demons that have been unleashed
on earth, he has no choice but to take action.  He joins Queen
Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and Poseidon's son Agenor (Toby
Kebbell) in an effort to reach the underworld and save his father.

Normally, I would be totally turned off by a film such as this that
relies mostly on its special effects to tell a story.  However, in this
case, it's obvious that a considerable amount of effort went into
making the effects work look believable, and as such, this film soars
as being the perfect popcorn flick that is enhanced greatly in 3D.

Yes, the 3D looks pretty darn good here, and that's something to
be said for a project the studio decided to upconvert rather than
film natively in the format.  In fact, I would describe Wrath of the
Titans as being a mostly satisfying in-screen 3D experience thanks
to a well-defined level of depth that allows a lot of space for objects
(dirt, rocks, ashes and fire embers) to float and fly amongst the action
on screen.  Overhead shots of Pegasus flying above the clouds, or
a nosedive shot into the chasms of the earth towards the underworld
look very impressive.  I also found Perseus's battle with a winged
2-headed Chimera to be incredibly fun to watch with its added
dimensionality (though its frantic pacing forced my eyes to readjust
several times). Unfortunately, some of the darker scenes inside the
labyrinth and underworld lend to taking the viewer completely out of
the immersive experience (which I find to be a normal occurrence).

In the above paragraph, I described Wrath of the Titans to be a
mostly-satisfying in-screen 3D experience.  That is true.  Just don't
expect anything to venture beyond the confines of your display,
however.  While there are a multitude of objects thrown forward,
none of it projects itself at the audience. Ghosting is not an issue
here whatsoever and I doubt anyone will experience any type of
double-imaging while watching this presentation.

The transfer looks wonderful.  The video encode is flawless giving
great attention to detail without any signs of artifacts.  Colors look
stable throughout, flesh tones are well balanced, and black levels
are deep. What I personally found to be a bit odd was the director's
decision to give the desert scenes a washed-out look to them. To
me, it looks rather overdone.

Be prepared to nail down the fixtures with this powerhouse 5.1
DTS-MA soundtrack that will test the limits of your subwoofer
and its potential impact for creating cracks in your ceiling and
walls.  Battles with Cyclops, Minotaurs and other beasties are
relayed to the viewer with tremendous force thanks to the amount
underlying LFE activity.  The rears do an excellent job of
supporting the film's effects that effectively pan across the
channels, making this a wholly-immersive experience to the viewer.
Dialogue remains crisp and intelligible, never getting overwhelmed
by the chaos happening around it.

Wrath of the Titans arrives as a 3-Disc (3D Blu-ray+2D Blu-ray
+DVD+Ultraviolet) combo packaged in lenticular cardboard
casing.  Both the 3D and 2D Blu-ray feature a Maximum
Movie Mode that allows you to control your destiny and
choose one of two unique experiences: The Path of Men
or The Path of The Gods. The DVD includes a set of
deleted scenes.

While not perfect, Wrath of the Titans rises to the occasion
of being a better film than the original.  The post-converted
3D is actually quite good, making the argument of purchasing
the more expensive version more plausible (if you are considering
either).",1453075200,2,5024,4.89728453364817

In this one she was more the Amazonian warrior. It just seemed a big separation from her previous character to a degree. Overall it was still a good movie.",1403308800,,521,4.931818181818182

Either way it goes, if you love Greek mythology then you'll love both! Wrath of the titans is full of enough action, suspense, and adventure to keep you on your toes. Not to mention an abundance of fire and explosions! There's also a hit of romance thrown it for those hopeless romantics.

4732664,3,B005LAIH5O,"For my money, Wrath of the Titans is a step down from Clash of the Titans. Sam Worthington returns to a land of ambitious visual effects and mythology brought to life, but something is missing this time around. It all seems a bit redundant and unnecessary, dark and somewhat intense without much of a payoff.

In particular, Wrath suffers from the absence of Io (Gemma Arterton, who gave Clash its heart) and the re-casting of Andromeda. Even though Worthington, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are back, it feels as though the emotional center is gone, and with it much of Clash's charm. Even the other Olympians are mostly absent;  to be fair, though, that is part of the plot.

I do not feel that this film adds much to its predecessor, so unless you are *really* into everything Greek mythological that you can find, or else just bored and looking for a way to pass the time, I would not bother with Wrath of the Titans.",1387497600,,922,4.542168674698795

Now again, don't let me get anyone thinking this movie is going to blow you out of the water, but just contrasting it with the first film: In the first, Perseus was a whiny little baby, didn't want to be a hero, complaining the whole time, atleast here he's just like ""OK, I'm a demi-god, let's do this thing"". I thought Cronos was really cool, fans of ""Age of Mythology"" should like him, Rosamund Pike certainly wasn't hard on the eyes and she fits the Greek beauty perfectly.

All in all, this was a fun film and huge improvement over the last one, I know it didn't do well in the theatre, but I think if you liked the 80's film this is a pretty cool modern continuation, and atleast in the this film they gave a respectful nod to Bubo instead of insulting that much beloved character as they did before.",1387065600,,1013,4.354497354497354

4732937,3,B005LAIH5O,"Admittedly ""Clash of the Titans"" had a bit to live up to especially for those sentimental fans of the original and it was a pretty decent remake of that classic.  And it did well enough financially to give a sequel a go.  But does Wrath stand on it's own two feet?

I think that the legs that ""Wrath of the Titans"" stand on are a bit shaky.  While Kronos is visually impressive (and, yes, the visuals in a film like this are something that we want to be impressed by) I can't say the same about the rest of the film.  The action moves too fast for an eager monster-watcher to really enjoy, except for the Cyclopses, and they come off looking a bit awkward (it made me long for the days of old when Harryhausen let loose his stop-motion magic on the masses).  The reteaming and reconciling of Zeus and Hades barely registers emotionally and Perseus, the everyman hero, earns little sympathy on his knight's errand to save mankind.  The only character that I found sympathetic (no doubt in part because she is also lovely) was Rosamund Pike as Andromeda.  The usually great Bill Nighy was wasted in this film in the figure of the dimly lit Hephaestus.  Sam Worthington's Perseus is given surprisingly little depth even as he is a father and has more to fight for than in the last film!  The complexities of the grandfather-to-father-to-son relationships in this film, as much as it strains to show their fragility in tension and strength in bond, just doesn't hit the heart target.

Oh, well.  That's not why I was watching this movie anyway but it would have made it more enjoyable if it had managed these emotional connections and given us an actioner wherein we could savor some of the visuals.  If they continue this series (and why would they?) they should introduce new blood and plumb new mythologies (how about a story about how Hades abducted Persephone?) and take more care in how they construct the action.  Oh, and get some new actors too.",1381017600,,1949,4.579250720461095

4733038,3,B005LAIH5O,"I went to see this with my son Zen, not having seen either of the previous Clash of the Titans movies, and not expecting too much. This one tells the tale of Perseus, being pulled out of retirement by his father (Zeus, the king of the gods) to help the ailing gods, who are losing power and also betraying each other left and right (there's a certain appropriateness of that, actually - villainy born out of sheer desperation).

There's a lot of humility and father-son bonding here that is fairly nice, and the rest of the movie is sheer action. Perseus fights a minotaur, a chimaera, some giant cyclopes and a fiery Cronos himself. Nice. Huge gaps in logic, and the general uselessness of Queen Andromeda and her armies don't entirely hinder from the enjoyment of the brainlessness of the film itself, which has a certain charm to it in the face of the Transformers-level mayhem and noise (and, of course, there is no Shia Laboeuf to be seen). Cronos gets the Galactus treatment by becoming a massive cloudy fire beast rather than a Titan that may have fathered a gang of pouty Olympians.

Bottom line - the movie is okay. Just okay, for adults, but perfect for kids.",1372032000,,1169,4.588516746411483

4733217,4,B005LAIH5O,"Ungrateful as ever, Perseus (a grim Sam Worthington) fishes while the number of gods dwindles to a mere handful of holdouts.  To stay alive, the gods require worship/belief in them; otherwise they snuff out like candles.  Isn't that a little like clapping your hands if you believe in fairies to save Tinkerbell's life?  Makes one wonder just how much power they wield if ignoring them ends their existence.
Be that as it may, not being a history buff or an expert on mythology, I had to view this solely as an adventure flick.  As with the first film, a quest is involved along with a stringent deadline.  It's brother against brother and while I do appreciate a good family melodrama, this isn't it.  There's redemption and death galore.  The CGI is front and center and holds sovereignty over everything.  Lots of action for the sake of action (not necessarily a bad thing).  Kronos does not make for a particularly scary monster so it's fortunate they have others to contend with as well.  Bill Nighy is great as the befuddled Hephaestus (his nemesis is small, gold, and fowl).  Ralph Fiennes, the villain from the first installment, is now reduced to serving as the petulant sidekick of the EVIL Ares (Edgar Ramiez).  (Ares is the most confusing casting choice of the lot, being Venezuelan, with a heavy accent that doesn't really coincide with Greek gods.  Did Zeus send him away to a South American college while he doted from afar on his son Perseus?)
This is a dopey but fun/exciting film that I can easily watch numerous times.  As long as I stop thinking about all those pesky details that make no sense.  From accents to why Andromeda went from a brunet to a blonde........

Supposedly, there's a third installment in the works: Revenge of the Titans.  Considering the number of gods left, who's going to take up the vendetta?",1365638400,,1838,4.729559748427673

4733222,3,B005LAIH5O,"Plot:
It's a decade since the events of the Clash of the Titans. The demi-god (half-humna, half-god) Perseus has become a fisherman, raising his son alone because his wife has died. His father Zeus warns him that the time of the gods is coming to an end and tries to recruit him to the task of ensuring his granfather (Zeus' father) Cronus does not escape Tartarus and bring death to all. Perseus refuses and not long afterwards all hell breaks loose (literally). Therein follows a quest to make things right again - and maybe kick a few monster and divine butts.

Things I liked:
- the special effects were superb
- the cinematography was great
- it has fierce giant monsters (who doesn't love fierce giant monsters!)
- the costume design for the Greek warriors felt just right

Things I disliked:
- the film felt brutal and rugged at most times and the few attempts at either humour or intimacy were incredibly poorly done. At first I blamed the scriptwriter or actors, but when I re-examined those scenes where these things belonged I found them there and the actors attempting them. Hence I could only find fault with the director who was unable to convey them to the audience. Truly, if these things had been evoked this would have been so much better a film because without them it was difficult to find the characters engaging.
- the sound-track was completely forgetable.
- the dialogue was a bit average
- the emotional entanglement between Perseus and Andromeda required a lot more work in the script
- so much of the landscape was bleak and stoney

Conclusion:
Buy it, watch it if you like fierce giant monsters and great special effects but have no particular need for character engagement.",1365206400,,1702,4.704697986577181

4733254,4,B005LAIH5O,"I like how the story was continued, though it started with tragedy.  I liked that the movie showed a more subdued hero than we usually see in a sword-and-sandal flick.  I also liked having a strong, yet not overly cliche female heroin to compliment the action.  I would have preferred that the ultimate villain not be so abstract; rather someone with more physical presence like Hades in the first movie.  It reminded me of ""Galactus"" in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, and whatever the heck that thing was in Green Lantern.  Much too vague to be compelling.  Still, the ending was rewarding despite how we got there, and the film overall was very enjoyable.",1365120000,,669,4.724137931034483

Wrath has constant action and complicated relationships between characters playing out. The scenes of Perseus leaving to go fight Ares adeptly showed his justified fear; pain when the gods were being picked off and dying. The rise of Cronos, who was a marvel of cool graphics. The chimeras. Pegasus. The plot of Hades and Ares capturing Zeus to give his energy to Cronos, and the plight of Perseus and all around him trying to save the universe, were all superbly done, as least to me.

We get fast moving battles and get to see the mythincal creatures the franchise is known for. The labrynth is really well done, though some of the CGI moves too fast on the small screen.

The movie had enough of a story for a summer spectacle, though I'm not certain why the character that built the labrynth decided to die when he did, its the only scene that was kind of jarring when I was watching the movie. Clearly if he went inside with the other characters it would be too easy to find out where they were supposed to go, but his death still wasn't handled well despite the demands of the story.

That's really all there is to it. Yes, it's steeped in mythology, and it might not follow these stories in a 100% accurate fashion.  But it doesn't matter.  This is an action packed ride that has you watching chimeras, cyclopses, and gods trying to stop one man.  Think of it as God of War on a much smaller scale.  Go into this movie expecting nothing more than a fun ride, and you will enjoy it.  Also, if you saw the first movie and were disappointed, still give this one a shot.

The depth is spot on throughout the whole movie, I read a few reviews that talked about some of the scenes in Hades being hard to see, but I had absolutely no problem with it on my Samsung. There are quite a few great pop out scenes, at all depths, you get embers floating out of the screen, then you have stuff fly right past you, its great, they did a wonderful job of spreading them out and having then at different distances, it adds alot to the experience. You can definitely see they learned from their mistakes on Clash.

The movie itself is an all out, balls to the wall, kick ass movie. The fight scenes are great and Sam Worthington does a incredible job, and takes quite a few beatings in this movie. The CGI is perfect and beautiful, it was really well done. The gods are alot more involved in this movie, which really makes this movie stand above Clash, because they aren't just sitting back watching stuff unfold, in this one they are thrown in middle of it all.

Overall this movie definitely lives up to its name, after watching it, in 3D especially, you feel like you have felt the Wrath of the Titans! If you have a 3D setup I would say this is a must see and a must add to your collection, no doubt about it.

- Agenor: ""That's right. I AM great.""

The time of the gods has passed, these superior creatures having been weakened severely by man's defiance, by man's aversion to worship. In this age, man has begun to look to his fellow man for inspiration. Ten years after Perseus slew the Kraken and forever etched his name in legend, he's getting called out again. All he wants to do is live in peace and obscurity and raise his young son Helius. What's a simply fisherman to do when the walls of Tartarus are crumbling? The impending collapse threatens to loose the fearsome Titan, Kronos, he who sired the three major gods of the Greek pantheon: Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon. When Zeus is betrayed and captured in the Underworld, his reluctant son, Perseus, once more assumes his demi-god's burden and sets off on a desperate rescue mission. Thanks to spectacular CG work, we're along for the ride. Thanks to pedestrian storytelling, it's a bumpy ride.

Greek mythology is riddled with families so dysfunctional even Dexter and Debra Morgan are shaking their heads. The Greek deities are a particularly messed up bunch. Kin overthrowing kin, and kin slaying kin. If you know your Greek mythology, then you're aware that Zeus and his ambitious brethren dethroned their progenitors, the Titans, and caged them in Tartarus. And here's Perseus now, off to save his shackled father and slay his gramps. But he's not on a solo quest. As in CLASH OF THE TITANS, he's accompanied by a tiny entourage. This time, his primary companions are Queen Andromeda and fellow demi-god, Agenor, caddish son of Poseidon. As Agenor, Toby Kebbell adds a shady element and very welcome levity to a somber and onerously grand enterprise. Note that Rosamund Pike takes over from Alexa Davalos as Andromeda. She's a bit stiff.

WRATH OF THE TITANS is weighed down by a serious case of blockbuster sequelitis. The first film, CLASH OF THE TITANS, offered a (slightly) more compelling narrative and plot conflict. That one had a truly cheesed off Perseus wrestling with his half-divinity even as he seethed against the gods, whom he (rightfully) held responsible for the deaths of his adopted family. In WRATH OF THE TITANS, Perseus has had ten years to come to grips with his acrimonious feelings against the gods, and he's toned down the emo stuff. Nowadays his dealings with his father Zeus tend to be more civilized. Still, it's a nod to continuity that, when ask, he refuses to come to his father's aid. Ten years later, and Perseus is still denying his fraction of godhood, still would rather remain a common laborer. It would take Perseus's witnessing a pocket preview of apocalypse in his tiny village before he leaps into action.

The two prestigious name actors - Neeson as ""Zeus,"" Fiennes as ""Hades"" - are slumming, but they still lend an elevating presence. You may say that this movie sort of redeems Hades. I say it marginalizes him. The hero requires a stoic and steely demeanor and a leveling glare and the occasional blank stare, and that's very much in Sam Worthington's wheelhouse. Rosamund Pike looks determined (but stiff). Toby Kebbell is good for laughs. The always watchable Bill Nighy cameos as ""Hephaestus.""

Like its predecessor, this sequel is a technically superior product, so superior, in fact, that the film becomes a relentless parade of CG-crafted action pieces, and never mind the human element which is the grounding element. WRATH OF THE TITANS, above all, is meant to be mindless entertainment, a summer blockbuster, and there's a place for that, and I like going to that place often enough. The skirmishes against the Chimera and the family of Cyclops and against those incredibly lethal twin-torsoed foot soldiers are really well done. The stilted acting comes part and parcel, as well as the formulaic video-game style plot progression and the silly plot holes (murderous but then tame giant scorpions, anyone?). It's all done by the numbers, and not once did I feel the film earned its sense of jeopardy. Kronos, when he finally ascended, would've been well served if he'd been allowed even more screen time to lay waste to the landscape just to pound in how much of a threat he was on an epic scale. But, like the Kraken before him, Kronos flails around some - and does rack up an impressive body count, credit him - but then gets his butt handed to him rather too quickly, in my opinion. Essentially, the film serenades you with thunder and bluster, but someone lost sight of the personal touch. Ultimately, all WRATH OF THE TITANS did was meet my lowered expectations. On the up side, there's another sighting of the metallic owl from the original CLASH OF THE TITANS.",1357430400,,4808,4.872860635696822

Perseus (Sam Worthington) chose not to rule with his father, Zeus (Liam Neeson), and wanted to live as a man with his wife Io. She has passed away since and all he has is his son, Helius (John Bell). He will not leave him. He knows that something is about to happen. He has a horrible dream.
 In the Underworld, in Tartarus, Zeus meets with his brother, Poseidon (Danny Huston) and his other son, Ares (Edgar Ramirez). They are there to meet with their evil brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes). It doesn't go well. Poseidon is attacked and then Ares attacks his own father, Zeus. Ares is so jealous of his brother, Perseus. He wants his own power.
  Meanwhile, in Perseus' village, a two-headed, fire-breathing, flying creature attacks. Perseus and his son survive.
 As Perseus and his son have arrived at the Mount of Idols, Poseidon, wounded and weak, tells Perseus that his father, Zeus, is being held captive in Tartarus. Perseus must go to rescue him. But, Perseus is only a half-god. Poseidon tells him he must find another half-god. This would be Poseidon's son, Agenor (Toby Kebbell).

Rosamund Pike now plays ""Andromeda"". Freddy Drabble now plays ""Apollo"", Kathryn Carpenter now plays ""Athena"", Bill Nighy now plays ""Hephaestus"", Edgar Ramirez now plays ""Ares"".
 Pegasus returns and so does Bubo, the Golden Owl.

I don't know why the critics are grumbling about this movie. I throughly enjoyed this story. It developed nicely and the special effects were outstanding.

Update: Warner Bros. is developing a third story.

4733937,4,B005LAIH5O,I rated this product with 4 stars because I love the movie and I love Blu Ray.  And yet more than that I love the way Blu Ray looks every time I watch a movie.  Now the reason I chose this particular movie to watch in Blu Ray is due to the epic nature and action of this film.,1356480000,,276,3.6610169491525424
4733938,5,B005LAIH5O,Received my order very quickly and item was as described. Made a great Christmas gift. Would recommend this site for sure.,1356480000,,122,4.857142857142857
4733939,3,B005LAIH5O,It was the usual mythological drama of course but excelled due to some of the best leading men!  The graphices and pyrotechnics were awesome!  Too much variation in sound though; growls and explosions over the top and dialog sometimes whispered and unintelligible...had to keep the volume moving line a roller-coaster.  The Cast was great but the over all product was a let down. I probably would not recommend,1356480000,,410,5.0
4733940,3,B005LAIH5O,Not as good as the first one was.  Wasn't bad but not much story line.  Good to watch if nothing else is on.,1356480000,,108,3.652173913043478
4733941,4,B005LAIH5O,"I wasn't a huge fan of the remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS.  I believed the Harryhausen version told the same story in a slightly better way--and I thought the CGI monsters lacked the life of Harryhausen's stop-motion examples.
This film, then, took me by surprise.  First, the storyline really does work--building on the characters and ideas of the first film and following through with the main theme of the death of the Gods.
The effects work is also superior--with more weight and depth than the previous film.  The fact that it was actually filmed in 3-D and not retrofitted also means that the picture is brighter and sharper.  A fun film to watch with some nice action.",1356393600,,674,4.686440677966102
4733942,5,B005LAIH5O,"Wrath of the Titans is a great movie. In this story, people have stopped praying and believing in the Gods, and the Gods are loosing their powers because of it. The tone is set early. It's brother against brother, a family of Gods splintered, never to be healed again. Perseus is the reluctant hero in this story. He doesn't really set out to save the Gods in a  sense, but to save his father, Zeus. I think the storyline is powerful. It shows the length a son will go to save his father. But that's not it for this movie. There is plenty of action, special affects, and magical places. It also has mythical creatures, including Pegasus again.

I really liked Liam Neeson in this movie as Zeus. I'm a fan of Mr. Neeson's work, and he never disappoints. I do recommend watching this movie. It is a great way to get away from the mundane.",1356393600,,836,4.352564102564102
4733943,4,B005LAIH5O,Great special effects and well done Greek Mythology depiction!! I would recommend it to anyone. Buy it- you won.t regret it!!,1356307200,,125,5.0

4733946,3,B005LAIH5O,I like the clash of the titians better. Had a much better story line in it. If you didnot see the first one then it is not bad,1356220800,,126,3.5357142857142856

4733948,3,B005LAIH5O,Not bad as these go. Production values very good. Acting average. Perseus as a reluctant hero is a little odd.,1356134400,,110,4.55
4733949,5,B005LAIH5O,I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this title. Action packed and fast paced. It was an improvement over clash of the titans. Granted this is not a masterpiece or something worthy of any awards. I still enjoyed it for what it was.,1356048000,,232,4.295454545454546
4733950,3,B005LAIH5O,"This follow-up to 2010's ""Clash of the Titans"" disappointed at the domestic box office and with critics so I suspect everyone has their minds made up.  I realize I'm a little late to the party but I'll do my best to defend the film.  I did see ""Clash"" and thought it was just OK but the 3-D was terrible.  I didn't have the 3-D option here, but otherwise it is pretty much the same.  One nice thing with this version is there are fewer Greek gods to follow.  Perseus (Sam Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and a human mother.

He is asked by old dad to help stop the destruction of the world caused by fewer gods (and fewer prayers!) and an attempt by kin to resurrect Perseus evil granddad Cronus, the father of Zeus.  Perseus refuses, content to fish with his son instead.  Hades (Ralph Fiennes), the brother of Zeus, and Ares (Edgar Ramirez), son of Zeus and half bro of Perseus, attempt to drain power from Zeus to help free Cronus from his century's old captivity deep inside their mountain home.

Perseus, of course, has a change of heart and agrees to free dad with help from a cousin (Toby Kebbell) who is also a half-breed cast-off and yummy Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike).  There is enough interaction between fathers and sons and intra-family squabling that many will feel right at home.  ""Wrath"" has plenty of creatures, bombs, explosions, fire and fist-fights as you would expect.  The CGI is pretty effective although one is always amazed at how these characters are constantly thrown against rocks, thrown off cliffs and come away not only unfazed but un-bloodied.  There's not much to recommend, but as long as you just ignore the stupid dialog, the movie goes by pretty quickly.  And of course there is Rosamund Pike.

As is often the case, the audio and video of this Blu ray disc far outsurpasses the film itself.  The transfer comes in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are vibrant and the shots feel almost like you're inside a video game.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option which is as good as it gets.  I suspect this has something to do with how immersed I often found myself in such an inconsequential film.  The soundtrack is awash in sound coming from every angle.  This is especially noticeable during the big action scenes of which there are plenty.",1355961600,,2323,4.589805825242719

4733953,3,B005LAIH5O,I like Sam Worthington as an actor. His Terminator role was terrific. He does a good job in this film but I have seen several versions  of this story played by other actors.,1355875200,,173,4.242424242424242

4734037,1,B005LAIH5O,"the movie was streamed through amazon instant video, it was a little hurky jerky but good none the less.

4734039,5,B005LAIH5O,"To be honest, I was not expecting much given the many lukewarm reviews but the lush visuals and amazing actions sequences more then make up for this films weaknesses. If only the chemistry and character development between Perseus and Andromeda had been developed somewhat it would have really soared. Despite the flaws, if you have any interest in ancient mythology it's always fun to see how top notch special effects wizards bring these myths to life. In that regard, it was a joy to see a family of raging yet reasonable cyclops, Pegasus in action, Pegasus with a personality and a great cameo shot of Ray Harryhausen's wonderful mechanical owl Bubo, sweet. The labyrinth scene was awesome and of course if you have a maze you are going to get a Minotaur. I thought for a minute we might get to see Theseus show up and lend Perseus a hand but that didn't happen. If they make another one in this series in the future - maybe they can do some special effects magic to bring back Steve Reeve's Hercules for a cameo too. Again, despite all the mixing of myths and flat acting on the part of some characters, the movie was a blast to watch and Cronus was indeed one scary dad.",1355702400,,1176,4.5

4734042,4,B005LAIH5O,"This is a good movie, one with great special effects and plenty of action, but after one kills the Kraken, lesser monsters seem somehow tame. So, up pops Chronos, the ancient Father of the gods seeking to remake the world but needing the power of Zeus to break his bonds and get free. Before his capture and imprisonment engineered by Hades and Mars, Zeus seeks out Perseus to enlist his aid. It is Poseidon who finally manages to convince Perseus to help and gives him his Trident to this end. Perseus finds another like himself a demigod named Aegnor to help find Haephestus the Smith of the Gods to seek a way into Tartarus to free Zeus and seek a way to destroy Chronos before he destroys the Earth. It's good, but I don't think they could come up with anything to trump it without repetition.",1355443200,,797,4.465753424657534

The explosions at the end where fantastic even though it seemed ridiculous for the armed forces to be fighting out in the middle of nowhere in particular.  Didn't most armies fight over something tangible like a town or city? UGH!!!! Though the army Queen seemed very much at home in this type of movie.",1354924800,,617,4.356521739130435

4734205,4,B005LAIH5O,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was good. That said, let's get the stuff I didn't like out of the way.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:

- The actors spend all their time whispering. Okay, this is fine I guess. Except that by the time you've turned your TV up loud enough to make out what they are saying - boom! You're back in another action sequence, and the sound is blasting at you too loud. This makes the movie a bit hard to enjoy when I'm trying not to wake up my kids at night. One solution is subtitles / closed captioning. But I've learned that nothing screws up the 3D movie experience more than using subtitles. I like them on regular TV. But they can't be used when watching 3D; it's just too distracting. So get used to the whispery voices. And crank up the volume!

- The characters are not especially likeable. Other than Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, I didn't care for most anybody else. Sam Worthington was alright I guess. He has a certain likeability. Certainly better than vacant-eyed Harry Hamlin was when he had his turn as Perseus! But nobody else I really care about. When you see them fighting and dying, it's hard to even give a crap. Even the comedic guy I didn't care for, because he was supposed to be funny and wasn't.

- I didn't like the actor they chose to be the villain so much. I mean, THIS is supposed to be Aries, the fearsome God of War? I don't think so. The guy looks like he belongs more in a catalog for men's underwear!

- The story didn't make a lot of sense. But I didn't worry about that too much. That's just par for the course for this kind a movie.

- The director seems to be a fan of the Michael Bay's ""Shake the camera really hard and make lots of quick cuts whenever there's an action scene"" method. Now I know that that's all the rage in movies nowadays. Everybody is doing it. But that doesn't mean I have to like it. Personally, I hate it. I would prefer to just be able to see what the heck is going on. A bunch of camera shaking and loud noises does not a good action scene make. Not to me, anyway.

- I missed Zeus's lighted costume effect from the first movie. Others railed on that as being goofy. I thought it looked really neat. I wish it had still been here. It's okay that it's gone; I just would have preferred it.

- Just like most other action flicks these days, the colors in this movie are all saturated and washed-out looking. Everything is gray. Why does it have to be this way? Why do all ""serious"" action movies need to look all gray and gritty? And speaking of gritty...

- The actors in this movie are dirty. Seriously, just take a look! They spend the entire movie covered in grime and filth. I realize that showers weren't so popular - or even available - back in those days. And it's true that the heroes have more on their minds than taking a bath. They are trying to save the world and all, but still! After an hour of it, it becomes noticeable. You start thinking to yourself, ""I wonder if they smell as bad as they look."" They are grimy and gross, and get progressively so as the movie goes on. At the end, one of the heroes is even smearing on mud. Finally, the girl gets cleaned up at least. Just in time for her on-screen kiss. I didn't notice this in ""Clash of the Titans"", but it's kind of distracting here. I mean dude! Wipe your face already!

WHAT I LIKED:

- I really like Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. They are good in just about everything, but I think they especially shine in these roles.

- Sam Worthington was decent. And what do you know? He doesn't have a crew cut anymore!

- The scene at the end I really liked, with Father and son.

- The use of 3D in this movie is AWESOME. I own a 55"" 3D TV, and this is one of the best 3D movies I've ever seen. There are several moments in it that are simply amazing to watch. Several times I just thought, ""I can't believe this looks so good"". Sometimes the 3D is unexpected, like when Kronos was attacking and suddenly Perseus is flying up on Pegasus to attack. It looked like he was flying from your living room into  your screen! And sometimes rock would fly at you. Little moments like that were done well. This movie really does 3D well. It never seems gimmicky. It actually adds to the story. (Not that there's much story here in this overbudgeted B-movie to add to, but you get my drift!) The 3D? HIGHLY recommended!

- Pegasus was done well. He also seemed more useful in this movie.

- The story has continuity with the previous movie. Yeah, Io is dead right from the beginning. That was kind of abrupt. And where did everybody else go? But the rest of it seems to follow really well from the first movie.

- The story was good, if a bit confusing. I did like it. As an improvement over the original, Perseus as a character gives up the rather silly notion of ""living as a human"", and embraces his heritage.

- I liked the notion of most of the conflict being driven by family troubles among the gods. This makes sense to me. I mean, I can't stand my own family and I'm only in my 30's! I can only imagine how annoying my family would be after ten thousand years as a god :)

- I liked that this was a sequel. Being a sequel of a remake, they didn't have to worry about all the ""new"" vs. ""old"" arguments that plagued the first movie. They could just make the movie they wanted to make. This was a good result, I think. And it left itself open to future movies, which I would also be happy to see.

- The special effects were excellent. I'm kind of shocked at how far CGI has come. Especially compared to the lame attempts in George Lucas's movies. This makes his films look like ""Jumanji"" by comparison. Of course, sometimes the special effects are just too darn good. I don't like it when I get that feeling that I am watching a video game. But you can't please everybody - especially me. Griping about the movie is half the fun!

- The weapons of the gods were cool. I especially liked Zeus's thunderbolt.

- The labyrinth concept and sequence was neat. I felt like I was watching a horror movie during that bit. And since I love horror movies, this was welcome.

- Cyclops? How did they make those pants?

- In another nod to the original, the Mechanical Owl makes an appearance again.

The verdict: Yeah, it's not cinematic genius but it is still pretty good. Don't let the movie review snobs drive you away. If you liked the first one, you will definitely like this.

And if you hated the first one, you might still like it. It depends on why you hated ""Clash"". If you hated that it wasn't exactly like the original, then you might not mind this movie because it doesn't have anything to do with the original. If you hated it for the special effects, jerky camera and/or other old fart reasons, then yeah you probably won't like this one either. But I thought it was great.

And that's me. I'm done. Peace out, people!

4734341,4,B005LAIH5O,"More serious scholars of Greek mythology find a lot to hate in these big-screen adaptations of classic myths, but for the easygoing audience, it's mindless fun.

There isn't a lot of plot to this film but the momentum propels it forward. Its weaknesses are the same as in the original -- not a lot of character development, particularly among the gods. There are some rather large holes in the logic behind the script, such as how the masses have ceased praying to the gods, and why some of the gods are powerful enough to ""end"" other gods. (Is it because they are still prayed to, or because they are younger?) Hades switches sides frequently, although it is cool to see Zeus and he team up together to fight a common enemy toward the end. The casting of Rosamund Pike brings a nice clarity to the group and she has great chemistry with her costar. Other familiar faces pop in and out, as well as gods that appear and are just as quickly destroyed or banished. There's also some neat glimpses into creatures from Greek mythology -- one eyed giants, fire monsters, and so forth.

Admittedly, the script is very thin but the movie isn't professing to be much more than an action film hinged around mythological aspects (and most of them are so far from the original myth as to be laughable). It never tries to be anything more than it is, and thus gives off no false sense of self-importance. It's simply fun, and now and again that's a nice thing to sit through. If you want something to sink your teeth into, look elsewhere. If you want a mindless couple of hours of pure entertainment watching some of the finest actors in the business ham it up as gods, set out to experience the ""Wrath of the Titans.""",1352764800,,1705,4.496774193548387

4734497,2,B005LAIH5O,"To say that Wrath of the Titans is marginally better than Clash of the Titans is like saying your glass of water isn't as wet, if anything it's the density of the cup it's in it. I might have liked Wrath slightly more since I wasn't expecting to like it any less. I thought a Clash of the Titans redux would have actually been pretty good since the original was no great shakes of a movie to begin with, it was badly written and had hopelessly out of date effects in it's day, it never occurred to me that a remake could actually be worst.
 This sequel picks up a decade or so later with the gods all butt hurt because mankind has stop praying to them. So Zeus (Liam Neeson) gets himself kidnapped by his spiteful brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and his ungrateful son Aries (Edgar Ramirez). So in a reversal from his Taken role Liam needs his son, Peruses (Sam Worthington) to lead a rescue mission and save his divine derriere.
 In what looks like a big budgeted Syfy channel movie, Wrath boasts good looking special effects that manage to remain unengaging and a story that is horribly dull and covers only the most familiar of ground. A few things did cross my mind while watching this movie, first I want to know how is it that the makers can get such talented actors to deliver such unspeakable dialogue with such earnesty. The other is that Rosumund Pike is very beautiful even when covered in dirt, she's also not a bad actress, I wonder why real stardom has remained aloof to her.
 Told in a completely straight manner, this movie never has any fun with it's silly premise. It takes it's self far too seriously. At least the wonderful Bill Nighy has a few good moments as Hephaestus, he gets to mock the ""release the Kraken"" line, talk about seducing a mermaid and has a moment reminisce of the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
 At least the 3-D effects are an improvement over the last time, at least I assume so, I didn't actually see it in the third dimension, but unlike it's predecessor it was filmed in 3-D. I'm glad that I did not see it in such as I probably would have hurt myself trying to pull off the ridicules cobwebs masquerading as facial hair on Neeson.
 If you liked the first movie, you might like this one. If you like Greek mythology, good movies or entertainment, then I would suggest passing this one over. Worth a few laughs, but awful lugubrious getting there.

""We enjoyed this film tremendously.  In fact, I appreciated the improbability of the action.  We are watching mythical gods here and their foibles and caprices.  What had us totally immersed was the beauty of the visuals.  Truly stunning sets and marvelous computer-generated images, in a way they made me think of an up-to-date of the dream-like engravings by Gustave Dore - also truly fantastic.  You see a world just created and still in evolution, where the elements are still in the upheavals of development: vast, yet untamed forces in a giant but yet untamed universe.""

If you liked 2010's `Clash of the Titans', which I did, then you'll enjoy `Wrath of the Titans' as well. The film brings back the hammy acting, campy dialogue and dodgy accents that came with the first instalment. The action itself drives the movie and tries to reach the same grand spectacle of `Clash' and, for the most part, succeeds, pitting Perseus and his faceless, cannon fodder companions against big, mythical, creatures that are usually faster and stronger than they are. It's the perfect movie for a night-in of mindless action, those who watched `Clash' will know exactly what to expect, those who haven't should know to check their brain at the door, sit back and enjoy the chaos.

4734675,3,B005LAIH5O,"Seriously, it was JUST ok, maybe a little disappointing even.

There were some decent effects but it was more like one big fight scene from start to finish. Not much ""story"" to this.

Perseus gets beaten to a pulp and even being a demi-god wouldn't have healed him enough that quickly to keep going after taking such abuse at the hands of his brother in their last fight - especially considering the injuries he'd gotten up to that point. Would it?  I guess it depends on what you the viewer accept about the demi-gods. And after Perseus manages to somehow get inside of Kronos/Cronus and back out again - you get the impression that Kronos/Cronus was killed by the weapon.  But that same weapon was used on him by his powerful ""god"" sons before and they only managed to trap him in Tartarus. (So if you're going to ""think"" about this movie instead of just accepting it as it comes - you'll probably enjoy it less than someone who doesn't care)

I see negative reviews of remakes based alone on the feeling that some movies are sacred and should never be messed with. I say if you can take a classic and make it even better, then by all means have at it. The 2010 version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B002ZG9788/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>&nbsp;failed at making the 1981 version better and the 2012 Wrath sequel didn't come close to redeeming the 2010 debacle.

I was actually encouraged when I saw that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Los-Angeles/dp/B004ULEEY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle: Los Angeles</a>&nbsp;Director Jonathan Liebesman took the reins from Clash Director Louis Leterrier, because I thought that Battle: LA was quite well done. But Liebesman stayed the course of a CGI spectacle with Wrath and abandoned any effort to make you think you were seeing anything that could have actually happened in Greek Mythology or any fantasy world; the death defying action in Wrath was completely unrealistic and the acting bordered on some of the worst that I have seen in the past year.

The story flow was a bit better in Wrath than it was in Clash, but again, not so much so that the end product was anything more than a below average screenplay. The concept was simple enough: Zeus (Liam Neeson) has been taken prisoner and Perseus (Sam Worthington) has to get him out of the Underworld and out of the clutches of Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares who want to sacrifice Zeus as a means to release the ancient Titans on Earth.

Then there was the acting, or should I say lack thereof. It didn't seem to me that Worthington or Neeson took their roles seriously at all. They came across as two A-listers making cameos versus lead actors giving A-list performances. This combined with some super-unrealistic, death defying (even for a God) battle scenes really took a lot out of the movie for me.

I was never even a fan of Greek Mythology until seeing the original Clash back in the 80s. After that movie I not only became interested in Greek Mythology, I felt I now actually knew something about it...like I just had a very clear and concise lesson in it. After the 2010 and 2012 Titans attempts, I felt the same way I did after the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000NTPDT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>&nbsp;movies...like I'd just seen a lot of cool FX with little substance to the story.

So my recommendation is to go back and watch the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-1981-original-version/dp/B000Q7ZOL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the 1981 original version</a>&nbsp;and watch the updated Clash & Wrath on cable. As dated as Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion effects will look in the 1981 version, you'll walk away from it with a much more entertaining and even educating experience. And if you're just looking for some mythological fun I'd say get yourself a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PlayStation-3/dp/B002I0J4VQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PlayStation 3</a>&nbsp;and spend countless hours with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-War-Saga/dp/B008CP6MA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of War Saga</a>.",1347840000,2,3560,6.154929577464789

This film addresses a lot of those problems, trims the fat off while maintaining something for the humans to fight for (sons) and limits the bad stuff enough to be entertaining throughout. The star though is the outstanding CG, which I think owes more than a little bit to the God of War cutscenes that came before it. Another smart move was giving Worthington's Perseus character help in the form of better comic relief, which reduces the amount of straining he has to do to show warmth to the audience.

4734832,4,B005LAIH5O,"You gotta give it up for Liam Neeson. Who else gets to take on roles for a Jedi Knight, Batman's mentor, and Zeus, the King of the Gods? Unfortunately, he isn't given much to work with in this particular role, but neither are any of the other actors. The closest thing to an enjoyable character we get in this flick is Poseidon's estranged, hippie son, who begins to refer to himself as ""The Navigator"" about halfway through the movie.

But this movie is not about character development and the existential dilemma. It's about battlin' beasties, mashin' monsters, and grapplin' with gods. And on that score, this movie is a pure success. The CGI is masterfully done (for the most part), with the high light being the two-headed, fire-spewing creature that smashes up Perseus' town BUT GOOD. Although it's strange to see (MINOR SPOILER AHEAD) a really lame looking minotaur rampaging about a labyrinth (it damn near looks like some dude running around in a rubber mask), the other special effects are just that- special (END SPOILER).

I actually liked Sam Worthington better in the first one.  On a more superficial level, I thought Sam Worthington looked better and more like a ""Perseus"" kind of character with the buzz cut, rather than having all that hair flying around, but again that is purely on a superficial level.

The reason Hollywood keeps putting out utter garbage like this is because we keep paying to see it. I really have to stop letting my friends drag me to watch this visual vomit.

Overall, the film is utterly lacking in visual appeal. The locations are drab and colorless from the first scene to the last, with little more than barren rocks, caverns, and the occasional ruin to look at. Every frame is suffused in browns, blacks, grays so there is literally nothing to grab or attract the eye. The only splashes of color are the sky, the sea, and frequent bursts, explosions of fire. It may as well have been filmed in black and white. Even for an all-action, all-the-time movie, it is one of the dullest looking films I've ever seen.

The plot actually manages to be worse than the first installment, in so much as it was clearly written as an after-thought to the action. I could readily believe that the writers penned all of the combat scenes first, and then hastily constructed a story to link them all together. The result is an almost incomprehensible mess with a lot of sword fights and fireballs.

To be fair to the actors, some of whom are of the first caliber in other films, there is very little they could do to breathe life into this script. One can only make so many grimaces while leaping and jumping and grunting, which pretty much sums up the dialogue. As another reviewer stated, Wrath of the Titans is pure product, absent of any creativity or imagination whatsoever; the fact that nobody associated with Wrath---from the writers to the director to the stars believed in what they were doing (apparently everybody was just there for the paycheck) shows in every single frame. Wrath is utterly lifeless, devoid of color, emotion, or meaning. In short, visual vomit.",1346198400,4,1928,4.68141592920354

4735277,3,B005LAIH5O,"This picture has a suitable enough tale (especially if you ignore a few holes) but is something you see more for the special effects and archetypes.

The ""Big Three"", Zeus (Lian Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), are trying to stop their father, Cronos, from coming out of captivity and basically taking over the world. It seems like an easy enough task but then Zeus is betrayed and the walls of Tarterus (which hold Cronos captive) begin to waver and monsters are unleashed. Wouldn't you know it but a two headed chimera shows up in Perseus' village. What were the possibilities? Maybe they're attracted to demigods just like in the ""Percy Jackson"" novels.

Anyway, as the world begins to unravel Perseus is called up to be a hero again and he and some others seek out to find Hephaestus. Princess Andromeda, now a warrior woman, assists.

What follows is predictable but again this is film you see for the special effects, not the story. Watch it for the battles and the mythological monsters.

A third installment is planned and that shouldn't be a surprise since the budget was $150M and it made a bit over $300M at the Box Office.

Watching this movie I was taken back to the amphitheater and can see great orators telling new tales of the wrath of the titans.

They may have taken a little too much time designing this presentation for 3D and spent a tad too much time on graphics. Yet the story showed through. There is also a good bevy of actors; one might be a bit distracted at first asking ""now where have I seen that actor before?"" but once the action starts you will be absorbed.

The tail is that people gave up praying to the gods. So the gods are losing their power and their grip on the imprisoned titans.  Some disgruntled siblings and offsprings join the titans in a tad of revenge. Can Perseus the son of Zeus set things right with a little help from his friends?",1345852800,,1061,4.403061224489796

4735285,3,B005LAIH5O,"I'd say that this film, a sequel to the ""Clash of the Titans,"" starring Aussie Sam Worthington as Perseus, bastard son of Zeus & a half-god, is competant action/fantasy.  Not stellar, as compared to Lord of the Rings, but engaging.  Fills in a lot of holes in the original stories of the Greek Gods with some creative writing.  But the ""I'm your father, he's your brother, he's your son"" line does get pretty tiring after a while.  It seems as though that's the main emotional catch that the writers use to try to get the viewers interested in these capricious, violent gods and their ever-shifting allegiances.  That, and the certain destruction of the world by some nasty super-gods (Kronos, held captive in the Underworld.  He looks kind of like the Balrog in Lord of the Rings).

By the end of the movie, you're saying, ""OK I get it!  Be loyal to your Brother!  Be thankful of your Father!  Always love your Son!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!""  The wife of Perseus conveniently died, so the whole family thing is pretty much confined to the males.  Hades, brother of Zeus (Liam Neeson), double-crosses him in order to free THEIR father, Kronos, from the Tartarus prison in the Underworld, until Hades (Ralph Fiennes) repents and becomes loyal to HIS brother again.  And then Perseus' half-brother, Ares, fights Perseus and likewise double-crosses Zeus, HIS father, until Perseus is helped by Helius, HIS son, to fight Ares the half-brother and free Zeus the father so that their Grand-father, Kronos, doesn't escape and destroy the world.  Get it?  And throw in Agenor, the son of Poseidon, cousin of Perseus, and you have some even more father/son/cousin/brother combinations going on there.  The only relief from all this hairy male familial angst is Rosamund Pike as Andromeda, who thankfully provides some female eye-candy, albeit the swaggering soldiering type.

The movie does actually provide some engaging fantasy scenes, particularly when Perseus, Andromeda and Agenor (""the navigator"") have to navigate the labyrinth.  Also when they fight some realistic-looking Cyclopses.  And of course, much similar to Perseus fighting the Kraken in the original, is the final scene in which Kronos comes out and threatens humanity.  (Hint: it involves Perseus on the Black Pegasus again!)  So it's entertaining, and you do wonder if/when our macho Aussie Perseus is going to fall for the lovely Andromeda (and if he's going to clean up all his blood & sweat before kissing her!).",1345507200,,2470,5.017199017199017

4735433,3,B005LAIH5O,"First off, the plot of this movie was not good at all. I had trouble understanding who is who in the in the movie and I was expecting a lot more action in the climax of the movie especially when Kronos woke up. It is an okay movie for entertainment and I really liked the graphics played out in this movie. Kronos really looked good and as well as other effects. The director who created Harry Potter, did a great job directing/producing this movie. Since I watch Harry Potter, I noticed little effects like the Satire in the movie that looks like it could come from the Harry Potter Series. Otherwise, I was just was not feeling the plot of the story. I could assume the girl in the movie was Athena, or was she Athena? I mean, what is a good Greek God movie without Athena?

I just wish that the plot was a lot more interesting and not to mention little bit educational so that people can be entertained by whatever story the movie is going to show. This movie seems as though the audience knows who were the Greek gods. Luckily, I did, but others might not. In addition, would it be nice to include other Titans too? It would become a five star movie if it included other Titans such as Gaia, and would actually match up with the movie title, ""Wrath of the Titans.""",1344643200,,1268,4.305439330543933

4735585,3,B005LAIH5O,"1981's 'Clash of the Titans' was the last stop-action animation film that Ray Harryhausen worked on. Harryhausen, a student of Willis O'Brien, the animator of the 1933 'King Kong', practically invented the modern stop action animated film. Harryhausen's first major film was the 1949 'Mighty Joe Young' and he continued to create fantastic masterpieces of film using the art of  the then under appreciated technique of stop-action animation. He was unique. Not only was his work difficult to do but he did it alone. He superbly managed to bring  clay characters to life.  His inanimate clay creations had emotions and personality. From skeletons to flying saucers to dinosaurs, the viewer believed in these characters even while being aware that they were not real.  'Clash of the Titans' was not his best feature but it still remains a classic movie today represents the vibrant dying past of film animation. It also is one of the better examples of child friendly films that was typical of Harryhausen's art.

 The 1981 'Class of the Titans' had little to do with Greek mythology but it was still a lot of fun. The realism he brought to his animation was not matched until recent CGI efforts such as Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings'.

 'Clash of the Titans' was remade in 2010. It was a slick, well-made, but generally lifeless re-imagining of the original film. It was a summer popcorn movie that was short on plot but long on fabulous CGI. It had even less to do with Greek mythology than the original but It had a very good cast and was a PG-13 film instead of  the original PG version. I was not a fan of this film. However it made a lot of money so a sequel was inevitable.

 The sequel was 'Wrath of the Titans'. This sequel was better made. 'Wrath' also has a very strong cast and very good CGI action sequences. It did not do very well with critics but attracted large audiences and made loads of money.  We will  be seeing another sequel soon.

 'Wrath of the Titans' has an excellent cast headed by screen veterans like Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Bill Nighy. The strong cast carries the film which otherwise might have been just another summer action extravaganza. Like its predecessor, 'Clash of the Titans (2010)', the film pits humans against the gods they think they no longer need. The gods are in trouble since without the prayers and worship of the humans, they will vanish into mortality and become just like humans. The Olympian god's father Kronos is trying to escape his bonds with the help of another god. Zeus asks Perseus for help and the struggle begins.

 There are some very strange changes in plot logic going on in this film. Human characters are not like the characters in the original. Behavior traits are almost reversed. Andromeda is now portrayed as an almost god-like female ruler. Io, Perseus' wife is nowhere to be seen. In fact there is little connection to actual Greek myth for any character in the film. The most humanlike portrayals are those of the gods themselves and the god-like humans. Keep in mind that Perseus and the comic sidekick Agenor are actually half god, half human.

 Myths are transposed from other stories or altered. Kronos becomes a volcano-like god (probably because it looks good in CGI), the Minotaur is transported to some kind of underground cave, and Zeus is tied to a magical post like some sort of King Kong or Christ. The filmmakers seem to have given little though to the actual Greek myths or even to some kind of consistency of story within the film itself. Yet, surprisingly, obscure mythological characters are interspersed thought the film.

 Even the basic premise of the film is reversed and is almost subversive to the plot. The basic idea of the preceding film and this one was that the humans do not need gods or kings anymore and that the need for gods is fading. Yet when it comes down to it, the film relies not only on the powerful gods but also the leadership of Queens and generals who if not gods themselves, represent divine authority of kings and queens on earth.

 'Wrath of the Titans' is an exciting CGI film that satisfies the need for fantasy action. It is all well done and visually appealing. Interestingly as well is that the dialogue and pacing is very good. The script and the acting is, in fact. what saves this film from being mediocre and just another summer time waster. One only wishes that there was more character interaction and less 'let's blow up things' in the film.",1344297600,,4488,4.689171974522293

His wife dies and he is left to raise his young 10 year old son.  One evening he senses his father, the god Zeus (Liam Neeson), and goes into the house to see Zeus looking over his earthly grandson.  Zeus tells him that times are changing, that danger is near at hand and that he will need the support of Perseus, his son, to help save the Earth from the Titans.  Perseus tells him that he would rather be left alone and to be a father to his son.  Zeus warns him that the gods are losing their power and immortality due to the lack of belief in the gods by humanity.

Zeus and Poseidon find themselves trapped through betrayal by Hades and Ares who have promised to free the imprisoned Kronos who has promised them that they can retain their powers and immortality if they free him.  Ares, who is Zeus's son and the god of war, is jealous of Perseus who is a demigod and Zeus's son also.  Perseus is reluctantly forced into battle to save not only Zeus but also all of mankind from the power of the titans and most of all Kronos.....

This movie was just OK and that is a shame as it had real potential.  Some of the actors just seemed to be going through their roles without real spirit and the script drags at times.  The special effects are very good but oddly enough for me to say there may have been too many special effects and too little real acting and storytelling.  Too much time was spent on making a spectacular movie with dynamic special effects for the monsters and more time should have been spent on the plot, character development and the love angle with Perseus and Andromeda.  With today's movie making technology you have come to expect great special effects but with such a big name cast I expected a better script, better acting and better storyline development.

The movie is entertaining but it just doesn't stand out from all the really good movies of the same genre.  It falls somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star movie but it is closer to a 3 star rating.

4735637,4,B005LAIH5O,"After Clash of the Titans, I expected a lot from a sequel... especially being the Greek Mythology Nut I am.

Wrath delivers everything I hoped for and then some.

Sam Worthington returns as Perseus... he's dead on when it comes to this role. He's so believable as a demi-god who doesn't want the power but doesn't want to not help his father Zeus who again is played by the GREAT Liam Neeson. Again returning is Ralph Fiennes as (my personal favorite) Hades, ruler of the Underworld. Liam and Ralph are SO believable as God brothers and they have this huge chemistry when acting together.

Now new additions to the cast such as Rosamund Pike as Andromeda (whom I totally loved by the way), Toby Kebbell as Agenor (who made me laugh several times but didn't turn the story too much toward comedy), and dgar Ramrez as Ares made Wrath of the Titans a really well rounded cast. I was pleased to see Bill Nighy as Hephaestus... he's one of my favorite actors and to see him is ALWAYS a pleasure but he was a VERY good Hephaestus with his babbling and ""One last godly thing..."".

Anyway... on to the creatures...

The Chimera wasn't half bad. I would have rather it not look so damn rough but hey... whatever. It wasn't the beast I was looking forward to. The 3 Cyclopes were VERY well done and believable. I enjoyed seeing them done in a way that didn't rob the story ... and it actually lived up to what I think (and probably most people think) a Cyclops should look. The Minotaur... while done in a believable way was not in the movie enough. The whole Minotaur fight was brief and really could have been explored more. And finally... Kronos the father of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. I was extremely pleased that they made Kronos so well. He kept his Titan stature but wasn't too overly huge making it a very well done effect.

Yes, the packaging was spectacular, i.e. the CGI. Except that the moving labyrinth was borrowed from Tomb Raider. The burning, fire-ash look, in people and other worldly critters has been around for a decade and is getting old. The CGI craggy canyons, caverns and rock walkways, also heavily borrowed, is becoming a CGI crutch.
The story lacked soul; just superficial and bland. Usual, not-creative & stereotypic, gods against gods with humans as pawn.
The acting from the first moments had that stand still and RECITE, monotonically, some dialogue that sounded like a mix of middle English and 21st century urban slang. Even the side-to-side head shaking gestures meant to convey some emotion like frustration seemed mechanical and rehearsed. At a point near the beginning an unscripted editing missed Pike (Andromeda) as we see her rolling her eyes in disbelief at what was being said.

Without having much of a reputation to live up to, Director Jonathan Liebesman (Battlefield: Los Angeles) is free to pretty much free to indulge himself and go crazy and largely does.  Wrath becomes almost like a live-action version of the popular videogame series God of War with battles against mammoth boss creatures like a Chimera, Cyclops, the Minotaur, and the giant, flaming titan Kronos.  The problem is that God of War has a log more depth of story and character than Wrath of the Titans could ever dream of having.

Set 10 years after the previous film, Perseus (Worthington) is living a simple life as a fisherman with his ten year-old son, Helius.  He is visited by his father Zeus (Neeson) who warns Perseus that because people no longer than believe in the Gods, the  prison of Tarterus in the underworld is beginning to crumble and threatens to unleash its denizens on the world.  Perseus has no interest in becoming in the affairs of the Gods, however.  Zeus meets with his brothers Hades (Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), as well has his son Ares (Edgar Ramirez), in order to rebuild the prison.  However, he is betrayed by both Ares and Hades who plan to revive the great titan Kronos.

The reluctant Perseus finds himself drawn into the fray when a Chimera attacks his village and a dying Poseidon tells him Zeus is being held captive in the underworld.  Poseidon must go on a quest to locate Zeus' Thunderbolt, Hades' Pitchfork, and Poseidon's Trident, to form the Spear of Triam, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos.  Perseus is joined by Agenor, the demigod son of Poseidon, and Queen Andromeda, as they journey into the heart of Hades realm to rescue Zeus.  Wow that even sounds like the plot of a video game.

The main problem with Wrath of the Titans is that it doesn't have a captivating villain to carry the action.  Even Clash of the Titans had that in the form of Feinnes' restrained portrayal of Hades.  But here he takes a backseat to Ares who is simply dull on every level.  Ares was described in mythology as ""overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering.""  Here he is merely yawn inducing.  Couple his performance with Worthington's refusal to fully embrace his own role, and you've got two guys who don't radiate much excitement or passion.

There is a liberal dose of lively humor in the performances of Toby Kebbell as Agenor and Bill Nighy as the screwball God Hephaestus.  Their antics will bring you to a smile on your face but their roles are relatively small.  The biggest stars might be the visual FX crew who brought to life the many beasts of Greek Mythology.  The Cyclops and Kronos were particularly eye-popping.  But in the end there's a desperate lack of Adventure in Wrath of the Titans.  This film should have had the spirit of those old Ray Harryhausen Sinbad films of the 1970s, not to mention the original Clash of the Titans but instead it falls flat in both story and character development.",1343260800,,3245,4.690812720848056
4735687,2,B005LAIH5O,"This is not just a bad film, it is an awful film.  Beyond CGI and spectacular action, there is nothing behind it of interest.  There are many reasons for this.

First, for anyone who knows mythology, it simply ignores what is known as the most basic stories.  Perseus was one of the earliest heroes, and because of his abilities was seen as a direct challenge to the Gods, but they all survived for later adventures, in particular for the Iliad and Odyssey, but everything else that followed.  Yet here, you have the gods dying off!  Moreover, the plot of Cronus emerging is also essentially made up.  Now, a hollywood version doesn't need to precisely follow known mythology to forge a good plot, but this is so far off that they shouldn't use the names of the Greek Gods at all.  (This was extremely disappointing to me as an amateur classicist, but it will not disappoint just pedants - it is bad for kids interested in mythology.)

Second, the characters remain almost completely undeveloped.  Perseus is a kind of automaton, a superhero who miraculously recovers from wounds, etc.  Sure, he has doubts about supporting the gods, but that is superficial.  The worst failing is with the Gods.  In mythology, they have extremely complex and multi-layered personalities, a delight to watch in a parallel story as the human drama unfolds.  But in this film, they are 2-dimensional and their actions and motives hardly make any sense.  This is a missed opportunity for storytelling.

Third, the film completely fails to present a coherent picture of the powers of the Gods, which have distinct limits in mythology, instead presenting them as mysteriously omnipotent and then vulnerable.  Why are the monsters there, what can they do or not do, and how do they fit into the story?  None of these questions are addressed implicitly, which you would expect from a subtle script.  As such, it makes little sense and is another missed opportunity.

The only thing I can conclude is that the producers were disinterested and just wanted to make a glitzy action film that would rely on star power to sell it.  The result is that it comes off as a crassly commercial product that utterly ignores the literary tradition on which it is based.  This stand in stark contrast to the excellent productions of Ray Harryhausen, who succeeded in creating mythology films that were more or less respected the tradition while being great action films as well.

I cannot recommend this to anyone who expects more than mindless action.  Even the wonderful actors are wasted in this.",1343260800,,2560,4.845622119815668

4735690,4,B005LAIH5O,"This film is a sequel to the recent remake of Clash of the Titans.  As the Greek Gods are in decline, an outside being named Chronos threatens all existence.  Perseus, played by Sam Worthington, must return and save everyone using the combined weapons of Zeus' thunderbolt, Poseidon's trident, and Hades' pitchfork. Perseus isn't interested in a life of adventure any longer, but is dragged in immediately by fantastic monsters and the Gods.  Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes return in their roles as Zeus and Hades respectively.

The action and adventure is spectacular in the movie.  The creatures are great, and the action is phenomenal.  In this area I would say the sequel even surpasses the original.

However, the sequel does fall a little short in the story department.  There are so many effects and action scenes in the movie, there is little time for story.  The first movie was stronger here due to the basis on the original Greek myths, while this film just seems to have an excuse for incredible fights and flame.  Evidence in lack of story development can be found in the short length of this film (under 1 hour and 40 minutes, including credits).

I have to admit that this was pretty bad...but this is indicative of many 21st Century movies I have seen at this point--no distinguished plot, actors (despite fame), and leaves you unfufilled when seeking a great flick. This movie can best be likened to a bad hangover morning-you kinda sleep it out. It took me 2 nights to watch this movie and I fell asleep before the first hour of it. I think maybe it was due to the immense amount of near-whisper lines that the characters had.

To it's credit, the graphics are pretty decent CGI animation, but you can tell that the intense details of a great CGI just aren't there-maybe it was budget constraints after wasting money on great actors so that they could fall out of glory from this movie.

In regards to 'sticking to the story of greek mythology', well that's a whopping F...but then again people are making movies like Abe Lincoln: Vampire Slayer (or whatever the movie is), so I do not think the departure from its source is a travesty given the current garbage floating around.",1342569600,4,1255,4.6441441441441444

Wrath of the Titans picks up 10 years after Clash of the Titans. The gods have lost control.
Zeus (Liam Neeson) traveled to Tartarus with his brothers Hades, Poseidon and Ares. Zeus seeks peace.
The young Ares will have nothing of it and imprisons Zeus and steals his Thunderbolt.
Hades and Ares have teamed up to drain Zeus of his power.
If you're lost, get a set of Cliff's notes on Greek mythology, or just sit back and enjoy the special effects. There will be a lot of them. Starting with the attack of the Chimera, a monsterous fire-breathing two-headed creature.  It has the body of a lion, one head of a goat and a combination head/tail of a snake. I told you.
Don't worry Perseus (Sam Worthington), Zeus' son kills one of the beasts, and then sets forth to save his father and the world.
Part of his mission is to Hephaestus, who created three great weapons that Zeus' Thunderbolt, Hades' Pitchfork, and Poseidon's Trident, and that together they form the Spear of Triam. That's the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. Kronos is the one Ares and Hades hope to revive.
While they are on Hephaestus' island they are attacked by three Cyclopes. A Cyclope is a race of giants, each with a single eye in the middle of his forehead.
The story is weak. The effects are great. You choose.

4735738,5,B005LAIH5O,"I have to say that I'm very happy to find out that this movie is one of the very few Motion Pictures that support the ""appropriate"" aspect ratio that most people (if not all) would like to enjoy in their movies.

WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:
For those of us who already hate the so called ""black bars"" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, the Aspect Ratio of 2.40:1 on 3D Home viewing brings back those horrible ""Black Bars"" and with that TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage.

Usually I don't mind those ""black bars"" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything away...BUT ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite.

SO WHAT'S THE ""APPROPRIATE"" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?
Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like THE AVENGERS, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.77:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of the FULL SCREEN of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.

With that said, This movie fortunately does support that type of Aspect Ratio which makes it completely worth the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version.

Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars because...the bigger the TV, the bigger the ""black bars"" .

ABOUT THE MOVIE IN GENERAL:
I did like this movie when I went to see in IMAX 3D, I think it had a good use of the technology.

STORY:
Story wise I don't think is half bad as many people say...it's not perfect, but certainly enjoyable.

SPECIAL EFFECTS:
Well I personally think the movie studio did better than the prequel from 2010.

ABOUT THE 3D:
I know a lot people will disagree with me on this one, but I think this movie had the best of use of 3D elements since James Cameron's Avatar.

The movie itself as I said it's not groundbreaking but certainly enjoyable, and what really makes it stand out from the pack is how well the director and his team were able to put everything together and make it look Amazing in the 3D Bluray version.

If you have a 3D TV and a 3D BluRay player, this movie will certainly make you proud of that investment...I know it did for me.",1342224000,,2431,4.320879120879121

4735741,5,B005LAIH5O,"After watching the dissappointing Clash of the Titans, I was a bit worried about watching Wrath, yet decided to give it a shot, good thing too. The story has some typical ancient Greek mythos- some hero/demigod decides to take a break from action and be ""normal"" and have  a family... until an offer comes up to help out with war, between gods and titans.
Said hero, Perseus, the son of Zeus, doesn't want to. At all. Yet when his village is attacked after a disturbing vision, it seems that he'll have to join the cause. Along the way, he meets beautiful Sergeant Andromeda who has plenty of brains to go with her beauty, and together, with the son of Poseidon, Agenor, they journey to stop the father of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, Chronos, from fulfilling his wrath upon the world.
Throughout the journey, the effects have been massively improved from the first to be much better, along with a more interesting story, full of more intriguing characters from Greek mythology, as well as settings, such as the living labyrinth. The story, itself, has more intelligence and personal pathos than Clash, as well as heartbreaking moments. The people and gods are more fleshed out than before, less cardboard cutouts.
All this to say Wrath of the Titans has been a massive improvement over its very dissappointing predecessor.",1341964800,2,1321,4.845132743362832
4735742,3,B005LAIH5O,"I really enjoyed this lighthearted action movie.

It's a fanciful contemporary spin on the myth of how the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, long after having dethroned and permanently immobilized their titanic father Cronos, have become less powerful due to the declining devotions of the people. ""Not without reason"" says Perseus sarcastically when he's visited by Zeus with this complaint.  Now here you have the first departure from the Tradition: per Hesiod, the declining sacred religious devotions of people signalled the fall of the golden age into silver, then bronze and iron.  IE, devolutionary descent into skepticism and religious non-observance harms the people rather than the gods.  But of course we live in the modern secular ""kali yuga"" ourselves and so the common inverse of the Tradition principle is the pretext instead.  Well that's enough semiotic interpretation there.  Back to the story.  So anyhow Old Cronos is about to bust loose, and hence the need for Zeus to enlist demigod assistance to whup the titans up oncet 'gin.

I wasn't overmuch bothered by this modern heresy against the ancient polytheistic Tradition, since the movie immediately presents not as grand tragedy, but as  fun and humorous.  Rather than the pretentious desacralized ""Troy"" of diretor Wolfgang Peterson, which plods unhappily along without the gods, as a kind of secular revisionist unsuccessful stab at improving the Illiad.

The all star cast was not wasted on this film.  Liam Neeson makes a fine Jove, a wee bit humbler than one imagines Zeus Olympias, but it works in the story.  Ralph Fiennes really steals the show as a conflicted Hades who goes the wrong way due to his ressentiment of his brothers, then turns back to the right path in time to save the day.  Unexpectedly, Vulcan has a big role in this film, which I found very imaginative, depicting him as a kind of skinny elder tinkering sage more so than the jealous cripple often conjured by the Hellenic myths.

Sam Worthington perplexes as Perseus a bit, overplaying the reluctant hero theme a bit.  I realize he was probably trying to bring value to a simple action role but hey Sam, thats all it really was. The demigod aspect of the character was just backstory.

Rosamund Pike plays an Amazonian Andromeda, all dressed up in a tunica intima and bronze greaves etc, leading the phalanx and so forth.  An even odder twist, but one sense that Hollywood now demands a female presence to fetch in more ticket sales.  She played it well even if it was obligatory and she's easy on the eyes for sure.

The special effects to me here were totally satisfactory and can't really help being besides the point with this series since the original ""wrath of the titans"" evoked by the title-- the one with Laurence Olivier and Harry Hamlin-- was unforgettable for how cheesy the stop-motion effects seem today.

All in all a good rental for watching with one's teenage kids.  I totally recommend it served up with pizza and beer.",1341878400,,2996,4.914512922465208

It has great effects and a large-scale plot, but overall lacking for any real character development or real ties to the viewer.

4735826,3,B005LAIH5O,"Sequels tend to either surpass or bury their original photoplay but rarely do both.  Director Johnathan Liebesman's 'WRATH OF THE TITANS' does just that.  Utilizing mostly the same cast from last years 'CLASH OF THE TITANS', the filmmakers did what the original fought against, overpowering the audience with CGI eye candy and taking away from the performances thereby having the characters as nothing more than game board pieces moved around according to the technicians whims boosting the lame screenplay. Mythical creatures not included in the original such as Minotaurs , Cyclops and two headed fire breathing canines complete the catalogue of Mythological Who's Who between both films. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes stand around and posture while our hero played by Sam Worthington is more wooden than the original which is not his fault, its what the script requires by sledge hammering the next CGI action montage down the audiences throats.  Poor Rosamund Pike and Danny Huston who are always excellent suffer the same fate as they are also engulfed in the proceedings.  Overall, not a bad time waster but it looks like the producers may make another sequel involving Perseus's offspring.  The DVD transfer is nice but grainy in its 1.85 aspect ratio probably due to the 3D theatrical format and the 5.1 surround sound gets a trite muddy during dialogue scenes crammed with music and loud roars being forced through the sub woofer.

4735834,3,B005LAIH5O,"This is the sequel to 2010's Clash of the Titans, which looks incredibly similar in all but the story details. This time, Perseus and his small band of adventurers search for a powerful weapon to drive back the Titan Kronos and keep him imprisoned.  In Clash of the Titans, Perseus had to battle Medusa in order to have a weapon to defeat the Kraken monster and to save the Princess Andromeda. In both films, Perseus goes up against surprisingly not-so-immortal gods and a slew of ugly, monstrous creatures attack humans with little-to-no way to defend themselves. Perseus is only half human though, as son of Zeus. And as Zeus' champion, Perseus becomes humanity's hero once again.

I'm usually a fan of films and novels that take a unique approach to Greek mythology, but Wrath of the Titans takes it a bit too far for my taste. The same immortal gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades from the previous film suddenly become weak, easily injured and mortal - without sufficient explanation. The film starts out very slow with dragging dialog that doesn't really further the plot, which is unfortunate since the film's saving grace is the adventure and combat scenes. Despite its flaws, I still enjoyed the fantastic special effects and CGI creatures, action-packed thrills, and even a bit of humor.

4735932,5,B005LAIH5O,"As a person that really enjoyed the 2010 Clash of the Titans remake, I was eager to see the sequel, the Wrath of the Titans. I was not disappointed. In some areas it surpasses the original. The special effects are absolutely stunning. The creatures and monsters that Perseus does battle with are rendered with breath taking photo realism . This self professed CGI junkie is very happy to be living in an age when the special effects have reached this quality.

Similar to Clash of the Titans the move has an uncomplicated straight forward story. It is also more of an action adventure tale than the first one. At the start of the movie we find Perseus living the quiet life with his young son. His wife, Io, has passed away. One day Zeus appears to Perseus saying he needs his help as the power of the gods weakens through man's disbelief. Perseus refuses until hell breaks loose and Zeus is captured by Hades and Zeus's son Ares who is jealous of the way his father has favored Perseus. With the help from Queen Andromeda and others Persues embarks on an epic quest to the mountain of Tartarus where Zeus's father, the Titan Kronos, has been entombed and where Zeus is being held and drained of his power.

This movie also had a bit more comic relief and humor than the original and this makes it a more lighthearted, fun and entertaining experience. The acting is fine and the all-star cast brings an otherwise straight B movie up a notch or two in quality. Movies like the 2010 remake and this sequel remind me of the 50s golden era of science fiction, fantasy and sword and sandals movies. Those were all B grade moves but still a lot of fun. So I view the Titans franchise in the same light and as long as they're enjoyable like this then I say bring on part 3!",1341187200,,1766,4.430769230769231
4735933,3,B005LAIH5O,"Awesome special effects don't always make a movie great.  Such is the case for WRATH OF THE TITANS, the sequel to the remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS.  The storyline, thin as it is, focuses on demi-god Perseus' attempt to rescue his deity daddy from the clutches of Hades, Ares and the fiery Kronos.  The film's pacing is good, but I wish there had been a few more monsters!  The film manages to include the mechanical owl Bubo from the original 1982 Clash...its brief but cleverly used.
A collection of talented actors are given little to work with but nobly acquit themselves:  Sam Worthington, Edgar Ramirez, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Toby Waddell and Rosamund Pike.
The climactic showdown with Kronos must be spectacular in 3-D which I am not fortunate enough to possess.

4736055,3,B005LAIH5O,"Watching movies is kind of like dining--there are times you want a superb five star meal and there are other times you crave McDonald's (or insert your favorite fast food restaurant here). ""Wrath of the Titans"" is mindless, cheesy fun and, if accepted for that, you'll enjoy it. It's the perfect McDonald's meal for the mind. As far as the visual effects and set pieces in the film ""Wrath"" beats its predecessor although the cheesy fun factor is a bit less in evidence here as the film has a more serious vibe. In a way that works for ""Wrath"" giving the film its own identity.

SPOILERS:

It's been 10 years since Perseus (Sam Worthington)last saw his father Zeus (Liam Neeson)after killing the Kraken. He married Io (Gemma Arterton in the first film), they had a son, Io died and he has returned to the simple life of fishing. Zeus returns to ask for Perses' help; the Titans are escaping and Zeus needs the help of his son to fight them. Later, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) captures Zeus and sacrifices his brother's power to release their father Kronos the most powerful of the Titans.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray looks spectacular--with a state-of-the-art, colorful and sharp transfer. The transfer highlights the fine CGI work and, really, this is a film about the visual effects not the acting, directing or writing.

Audio is also spectacular with a very active lossless presentation.

Director Jonathan Liebesman does a credible job of setting up the action and making the film look good. I'm not sure how the screenwriters got their jobs (Dan Mazeau didn't have any credits that I could find prior to this movie while David Johnson wrote a couple of episodes of ""The Walking Dead"", the horrible ""Red Riding Hood"" and ""Orphan"")for this particularly movie but they do construct a servicable script although the dialog can often be pretty over ripe and stinky at times(""Look at me now: in the bowels of Tartarus, saving the universe. Just follow the Navigator."")

If ""Wrath"" is the Happy Meal of cinema, then Sam Worthington is one of many toys that gives us plenty of distraction. Worthington demonstrates more confidence this time around (and has more hair as well). The rest of the cast vary from attractive visual distractions to amusing performances.

Luckily, most of the performances are pretty good especially Bill Nighy as Hephaestus, Rosamund Pike (replacing Alexa Davalos)as Queen Andromeda and Toby Kebbell as Agenor. As usual Neeson and Fiennes both do their best with the material their given. The best performance is given by Edgar Ramierez as Ares who provides a sympathetic portrayal as a villian. He shows up the veterans and the star in a nicely tuned performance that's more complex than what's truly in the script.

The special features include a dual ""Maximum Movie Mode"" where you can choose ""The Path of the Gods"" or ""The Path of Men""--each is a unique glimpse behind-the-scenes into Greek mythology (in the case of the former)and behind-the-scenes footage (in the case of the latter). ""Focus Points"" allows you to see the behind-the-scenes footage if you would prefer not to watch the movie again in ""Maximum Movie Mode"" to see the extras.

We also get unfinished deleted scenes and, quite honestly, the film doesn't suffer for having them cut out.

Nobody will mistake ""Wrath"" as intellectual nor a great movie but it sure is fun.",1341100800,,3358,4.894366197183099
4736056,2,B005LAIH5O,"After the great special effects laiden but terribly done remake of ""Clash of the Titans"", it was expected a sequel would come. Now with ""Wrath of the Titans"" it has, in this flick Perseus (Sam Worthington, ""Man on a Ledge"") is asked by his father Zeus (Liam Neeson, ""Taken"") to help the gods before Hades (Ralph Finnes, ""Red Dragon"") releases the Titans from the underworld and they along with their demonic leader Kronos can wage war on the earth and the heavens.

Thats about it for the story, the sets are lush and impressive, and much like ""Clash"" there's not a lot of good acting (which honestly isn't what people go to these movies for). A few other characters in the cast are Ares (Edgar Ramirez, ""Vantage Point""), Agenor (Toby Kebbell, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"") and Queen Andromeda (The beautiful Rosamund Pike, ""Die Another Day""). As we all know with these type of movies, the main focus is the action and special effects which are the only good parts of the film. The creatures are impressive especially Kronos but like the Krakken in ""Clash"" it makes a big splash but isn't on for long.

Of course if you don't turn your brain off before watching this you'll be bored 10 minutes in, sadly I did this and it still got boring. This should've been called ""Wraith"" not ""Wrath"" cause any tension, suspense or caring for the characters is as transparent as a Wraith. ""Immortals"" to me was a perfect example of how to do a swords/sorcery/gods themed movie, ""Clash"" missed the mark and ""Wrath"" does also.

They did not resolve the problem in the way I had asked and hoped for but more problematic is that they did not even comment on the actual problem of their website not allowing me to redeem the movie in the first place.  Disappointing outcome from WB and Flixster, especially after Clash of the Titans was a Mac and WIndows compatible download.

Thankfully, ""Wrath of the Titans"" did provide haters of the remake a jumping-on point to give this new tale of Perseus a chance. I choose to think of this movie as a sequel to the original 1981 movie. I know it seems ridiculous, but it's what I have to do to come to grips with this follow-up.

The ""Wrath of the Titans"" Blu-ray is a worthy purchase for fans of Greek mythology and fantasy films. The movie itself is a step above the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake. It's full of action and the special effects are effective.

4736061,3,B005LAIH5O,"I'm a 3D enthusiast and purchase most anything released in 3D. The earlier Clash of the Titans worked well for me and 4 stars for that one. This one really lacked an engaging story and was panned as dreaded awful by many reviewers. Rightfully so as the story is not really there for most any viewer and for the 12 year old crowd, it should have a decent story. Stilted acting is a turnoff for the critics who panned it.

Let's move on to the gorgeous sets and outstanding costumes! This is a VISUAL DELIGHT and the 3D special effects are outstanding as they were in the ""Clash of the Titans."" For this visually oriented viewer a story is not really that important in order to view more than one time. I do know I'll enjoy it over and over and maybe use the fast forward button for the torture scenes in hell! I imagine kids won't like this part much on any viewing and they did dwell TOO MUCH on those scenes.

This is a creative endeavor for the film makers and the scenes with the maze, like a (mouse through a maze) were engaging and creative. The big ending with the bad god trying to destroy the world was on par with the destruction of Kraken in the other film. If you have a choice, select the ""Clash of the Titans 3D"" as the better film. Box office figures were down about a third on ""Wrath of the Titans,"" however were substantial.

4736138,3,B005LAIH5O,"Clash of the Titans gave us a modern view of greek mythology filled with beautiful sets and scenery, handsome actors and stunning actresses all wrapped up in amazing special effects and no room for a story. The first film was entertaining enough to warrant a look at the sequel ""Wrath of the Titans"" but unfortunately not even Ralph ""Voldemort"" Fiennes and Liam ""Qui-Gon"" Neeson could save this disaster.

First, Io, the lovely Gemma Arterton, is no where to be seen in this film, we are left to assume that Perseus (Sam Worthington) fathered her baby, she dies off screen and he is alone to raise his son. Ares conspires with Hades to sap all of Zeus' energy to release Kronos (the only titan) from Tartarus and bring down humanity and the rest of Olympus. Perseus is called up by both man and god to fight off this evil threat and rescue the world.

The movie looks great, Kronos looks massive and menacing just like the titans from God of War 3, Ares is portrayed as the bad guy, once again a plot device from God of War, I think the writers need to brush up on their literature, Ares is the God of War not the God of Deception and Cowardice. Andromeda has become this generation's Zena warrior princess and Perseus looks disinterested in his own adventure. I have to say this but in my review of Clash of the Titans: The Video Game, I mentioned that this series is ripping off the God of War franchise and this movie proves it. A quick Youtube search of God of War gameplay will reveal the ""source"" material the writers got their inspiration from and do not even try to hide (similar copy of a lava titan, a shifting puzzle area to overcome,a villianous Ares)

Many respected actors make an appearance in this film and at the end when Zeus and Hades take to the battlefield to stop Kronos's forces is short and unfulfilling. After all with today's technology and our unlimited imagination, why cut short the awesome powers Neeson and Fiennes could unleash and keep the ONE titan's fight scene so tedious. The only trick the filmmakers seem to manage is that they keep fooling us to come back to them in the hopes of a better film, they must have graduated from the George Lucas school of film and special effects.

It is a good film to enjoy if you do not want to think about a plot or invest yourself in a character or their outcome. Looks great in Blu-ray.",1340841600,2,2362,4.473317865429235

The numerous monsters and creatures really seem alive and present in the scenes.  There are fabulous scenes of  temples, moving mazes, and lots and lots of creatures.  The black Pegasus is back, better than ever.  (there is one marvelous scene, where an annoyed Pegasus smacks Perseus with his wing)  There is action and excitement and heroics.  The movie does not suffer from the darkness that ""Clash of the Titans"" had, which made many scenes hard to make out.  What it does have in common with the first movie, is the choice of colors. Really,  if you are going to film in color, how about you use, well,  some COLORS!  The entire movie is filmed in sepia tints, with only the blue sky and sea to break up the browns, rusts, sands, beiges, and blacks.  Still for all of that, the movie is well worth watching and buying.

Spoiler Alert----Just so you know, I am going to mention specifics of the movie, what I liked and didn't, and what I thought, so if you don't like to read that kind of thing, stop here.

The movie begins in the twilight of the gods of Olympus.  Apparently following several years after the first film, ""Clash of the Titans"",  the human race has continued to lose faith in the gods and to turn from worshipping them.  The gods have depended for so long on the strength given them by the faith of humans that they are all losing their powers.  The most immediate threat caused by this is that the barriers between earth and Tartarus are breaking down.  All the demons and monsters imprisoned there are escaping to rampage in the human world.  And if Kronos, the monstrous father of the elder gods, (Zeus, Hades and Poseidon) should escape, all of creation will be destroyed.

Zeus, Poseidon and Aries go to Hades realm to confront Kronos, only to be met with treachery and death.  Zeus is captured and Poseidon mortally wounded. The other, younger gods (Apollo, Aphrodite, etc.) are all conspicuous by their absence.  This is one of the places were I wished the movie had been longer and with more detail.  Hades delivers a one line explanation that, like him, the other gods will live if they support Kronos.  This really doesn't hang together.  All the younger gods, and numerous demi-gods, all decided to run and hide, and trust their fates to Kronos?  Doesn't really track.  And if they did, wouldn't Zeus and Poseidon have noticed something wrong?  Are the younger gods already dead, or so weak that they cannot offer any support?  Nothing about them is really mentioned.  In fact, why did Zeus travel to Tartarus with so little backup?  Sure, Poseidon and Zeus are the most powerful of the gods, and maybe this is a case of hubris on their part.  And a fatal error, as they do not suspect treachery of Hades and Aries, and underestimate how much their powers have been weakened.

The gods seem terribly human here.  I found the scenes between Zeus and Hades very touching.  There is guilt and forgiveness on both sides.  Hades' greatest fear is very telling: humans have immortal souls, that pass on after the death of their mortal bodies---but what about the gods?  Do they have souls as well, that will continue, or do they simply fade into oblivion if they should die?  A truly human fear, and an interesting thought.  Humans have their many religions and faiths to turn to in times of trial---but what of the gods?  If you are a god, and your power fails you, where do you turn for succor, if you believe in nothing greater than yourself?

And the god Aries?  His weaknesses are truly human.  How sad it is that Aries, powerful, immortal god of war, is jealous of his half brother, Perseus.  Perseus, who has no godly power, who is not immortal, who lives in a hut and works as a poor fisherman, lucky if he has enough to eat day to day?  You would think that Perseus would be beneath Aries' notice, but Aries is jealous because he thinks that Zeus loves Perseus more than Aries himself.  And he has allowed his bitterness to fester into unreasoning hatred. He is so fixated on hurting both Zeus and Perseus that he does not care about anything else.  And so he makes a devil's bargain with Kronos.  Supposedly Kronos has promised Hades and Aries their immortal lives, if they free him.  Both ally themselves with Kronos out of their weaknesses: Hades out of his fear of perishing forever,  Aries out of his hatred and jealousy.  And neither one of them are using their heads----when Kronos is free, why should he keep his bargains with anyone? Zeus tries to warn the pair, to no avail.

Poseidon lives long enough to give warning to Perseus,  setting off the action for the rest of the story.  Interestingly enough, he sends Perseus to find his own half human son.  The two demi-gods ally themselves and set off to rescue Zeus and stop Kronos.
There are some great scenes between them, although I would have liked to see more.  The passing of the gods is very well done---they crumble to ash, leaving nothing behind.

Liam Neeson does a wonderful job as the god Zeus, making the character regal, godly, but loving and human as well.  I am very pleased that Mr. Neeson has finally been getting the appreciation from the public that he deserves.  He appears in more movies, in better roles and with far better acting than half the so called ""super-stars"" of today combined.  Neeson makes the character of Zeus seem alive, both noble and human, with faults and strengths. In Greek and  Roman mythology, none of the gods were particularly noble or admirable characters, much less people who's passing you would mourn. But Liam Neeson gives Zeus all those qualities.  He has some short but truly fine scenes with Hades,  where both of the brothers ask for, and grant, forgiveness to each other.  Hades seems far less the monster than he was in the last movie. Hades realizes that he has been controlled by his fear, and has a ""What have I done?!"" moment.  Faced with their final ends, both gods forgive their offences against each other, and remember their loving bonds as brothers.  I loved the scenes where both godly brothers go to war against Kronos to save the world and the human race, even though they both know the probable consequence for that action. Between them, and Perseus, Kronos is destroyed and earth is saved.

Zeus is killed, living only long enough to give a loving farewell to Perseus.  I really objected to this part of the story, although it is very dramatic.  I really thought that Hades should have been killed,  and Zeus should have survived to rebuild Olympus.  Although perhaps this was really a better punishment for Hades, as his godly powers are now mostly gone, and he may have only a short time to live.  He must face his worst fear, all alone.

I, for one, do not believe that the gods had no souls.  No beings capable of such depths of feeling, of such great deeds, of such great hopes, could be bereft of immortal souls.  So rest in peace Zeus. And Poseidon, and yes, Hades as well.  You all did well.

And they left the race of man behind them. Just as flawed, but just as capable of  greatness.  And perhaps we are better for it, because our accomplishments take so much more effort.

In a way, the ending of this movie reminded me slightly of the end of the story ""The Lord of the Rings"".  The end of both stories see the beginning of the reign of man, and the end of all things of magic.  With the gods gone,  we have to assume that all the wonders (like Pegasus) and terrors (monsters, demons) will slowly fade away, leaving man in sole possession of the world. The torch is passed, from Zeus to Perseus, to his son, Helios.  The gods have gone, but left the half-gods, like Perseus, behind.  And they are more human than not.

This movie was fun, a good watching experience.  I would recommend it.",1340668800,9,7875,4.582078853046595
4736271,1,B005LAIH5O,"My normal method for coercing myself to sleep when I have a headache is to watch a bad movie, then write a bad review, then hopefully be exhausted enough to drift off to dreamland.  Enter the Wrath of the Titans.  As it turned out, I didn't have to write a bad review in order to fall asleep: the movie was bad enough.  Still, some thoughts linger, mainly of how dreadful a movie it was.

***SPOILERS, PROBABLY***

Wrath of the Titans is one of those films which would not only have no reason to exist were it not for an astonishingly stupid decision made by the hero at the outset, but which is only kept going by a further series of stupid decisions.  Perseus is living a serene, godless existence as a fisherman.  Io (Gemma Arterton from the previous film) has died, leaving Perseus with a son, Helius, who is now a lad.  Zeus comes one evening to tell Perseus that, in the absence of human prayer, the gods' power is diminishing.  This includes the restraints Zeus placed on his father Kronos to keep him imprisoned in Tartarus.  Demons are already breaking free of the underworld to wreak havoc on mankind, but once Kronos escapes it will mean oblivion for gods and men.  Would Perseus please help?

""The world may be obliterated, but I promised my wife that I'd look after my son,"" is essentially Perseus's answer.  Consequences be damned, apparently.  Zeus smiles and vanishes.  Later that night, Perseus wakes up freaked out by a dream he had of the world ending.

Meanwhile, Zeus meets up with his brother Hades in the underworld.  Zeus's son Ares is also there.  While both are ostensibly present to help keep Kronos in Tartarus, they trap Zeus, whose power they will actually use to free Kronos, who will allow Hades and Ares to keep their immortality.  Why the double-cross?  Well, Hades still resents Zeus for giving him dominion over the underworld, and Ares resents Zeus for preferring Perseus over himself.  Mass destruction therefore makes sense.

Perseus changes his mind and goes on a quest with Queen Andromeda (who is even more useless than Perseus) to search for the entrance to Tartarus so he can free his father and defeat Kronos.  Along the way he runs into Hephaestus (played by Bill Nighy, who does that routine of his where he raises his eyebrow, leans forward, blinks, and then lurches back as if he's been spat on, which perhaps is meant to be visual comedy, and probably would have been had he not done it for {whats seems like} every film he's been in) who takes them to the entrance of Tartarus before he's stabbed by Ares, who is able to find them all because one of Andromeda's warriors prayed to him, even though she was quite explicitly told not to lest Ares discover her and kill her, which he does.

Anyways, after stumbling through a frustrating rubix-cube of a maze, the gang make it to Zeus.  Perseus attempts to free him.  It's hard going at first, but once Zeus tells him to believe in himself the manacles practically fall away.  Hades has a change of heart at the last minute, putting him at odds with Ares, who's still pissed off.  By now Kronos, a giant of volcanic rock and seething magma, has broken free.  But Ares still finds time to face off with Perseus in a temple atop a mountain, making Helius, whom he has kidnapped, watch the bizarrely erotic spectacle.  Perseus prevails, taking Zeus's thunderbolt (which Ares had stolen) and combining it with Hades's and Poseidon's tridents to form a mega-weapon that he shoves down Kronos throat, bringing on a cosmic bout of acid-reflux, thus annihilating the Titan.

Zeus, proud father of demi-god Perseus, crumbles to dust.  Hades does not crumble to dust but says his power is gone anyway.  Perseus gets over it all rather quickly, as evidenced by his putting the moves on Andromeda, who was an old flame of his after all.  It had been ambiguous when she first appeared, making for the only tension in this film.  A tension which was, in the end, worthless.

It seems Warner Bros. are contemplating a third Titans film, which is strange since they needn't have bothered with this one (or the one before).",1340668800,6,4104,4.659248956884562

4736274,3,B005LAIH5O,"Watchable if humdrum sequel to the 2010 remake of ""Clash of the Titans"" brings back Sam Worthington as Perseus, once again living in his small fishing village with his young son when Zeus (Liam Neeson) comes calling. Unsurprisingly, Zeus demands Perseus' help once again when Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Aries strike a deal with the nefarious Kronos to unleash the rest of the Titans and rule human kind. Setting out with a party that includes Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike, replacing Alexa Davalos), Perseus treks across ancient Greece in order to defeat another army of giants, monsters and similar CGI creatures.

Director Jonathan Liebesman (""Battle: Los Angeles"") replaced Louis Leterrier for ""Wrath of the Titans,"" a formulaic sequel that oddly jettisons the intention of its predecessor's reshot ending (which brought Gemma Arterton's heroine Io back from the grave, only to have her character be deceased from this sequel's opening frame!). The film also lacks Laterrier's set-pieces - not to mention its 2.35 widescreen dimensions - but still functions adequately enough as an effects-filled fantasy for genre fans and younger viewers. Worthington seems more relaxed here and the 3-D - though once again converted in post-production - is much more effective than ""Clash,"" boasting little ghosting and an overall natural appearance.

Warner's combo pack includes a satisfying 3-D Blu-Ray presentation of the film plus a copy of the standard Blu-Ray, DVD and Ultraviolet copy.

4736605,3,B005LAIH5O,"This is a review of the 3D in the movie, for those interested in 3D:

With Clash of the Titans 3D, movie goers new to 3D were excited to see the next big 3D movie starring Sam Worthington (also from Avatar) shortly after Avatar 3D hit theaters and became a world wide phenomenon, igniting a new wave of 3D entertainment in theaters and at home.

Prime Focus had the task of converting Clash on an extremely short, tight schedule to meet a deadline, and the results showed in the execution, which paled drastically in comparison to the strong three dimensions seen in Avatar 3D. Clash 3D didn't live up to the expectations of how great 3D can be, as seen in Avatar 3D, as Clash 3D offered a generally weak 3D experience, with very little 3D parallax layer separation, resulting in a flat look.

So with Wrath of the Titans 3D, the expectations were much higher with better 3D software and more time to convert the 2D film (again, a 2D to 3D conversion instead of being filmed in 3D), because how could they go much lower than Clash 3D afterall?

Wrath of the Titans 3D is thankfully a step up from Clash 3D, but not by much. The 3D is apparent throughout, and fairly consistent from shot to shot, but don't expect Avatar strength 3D here. Yes, it is a conversion, where they have to duplicate a single film into two separate files, then offset one eye file to create three dimensions, filling in the gaps as they progress.

Unfortunately, they didn't push the offset far enough, and the results are average 3D at best. At no point did the 3D ""wow"" me like Avatar 3D did. That translates to 3D that doesn't take things very far, and we end up with low to average parallax layer separation, with minimal distance between foreground to background objects and characters. It's not bad at all, it's just not as great as it could have been. Most of the film feels a bit flat, but some shots stand out, in particular the finale. Maybe we'll get strong 3D for the 3rd film. Ultimately, worth a look if you enjoyed the first film, Clash of the Titans 3D.

3D Overall: 3/5
3D Parallax Layers: 3/5
3D Depth: 3/5
3D Character Dimension: 3/5

STORY: The story here is pretty basic, a quest adventure with a small team led by Worthington's character, the son of Zeus, with the aid of his father played by Liam Neeson, on their way to confront Hades and his evil companion determined to re-ignite the father of all gods, a lava giant. Plenty of great mythical monsters throughout, and a generally decent adventure movie with some nice performances and brilliant special effects.

Movie: 4/5 for Adventure Fantasy",1337212800,8,2596,4.54389721627409
4736606,3,B005LAIH5O,"Only two years have passed since ""Clash of the Titans."" I was not much impressed with the film's dull story and weak acting, except that of Liam Neeson playing Zeus. Visuals were pretty good (I didn't see the film in 3D) though it lacked the imagination of Ray Harryhausen. Now its sequel ""Wrath of the Titans"" arrives, which is neither better nor worse than ""Clash,"" visually or story-wise.

Sam Worthington is back as demi-god warrior Perseus, now a father of a ten-year-old son Helius (John Bell). This time Perseus, together with Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), sets out to rescue the captive Zeus and save the world from the Titans. I don't know how they could capture the almighty god. Also, sorry if I am wrong, but I think I saw only one Titan. Well, I think you see my point. Storytelling is not the strength of ""Wrath of the Titans,"" just like its predecessor.

For the sequel to ""Clash of the Titans,"" Jonathan Liebesman (whose previous work was an effect-ridden alien invasion action ""Battle Los Angeles"") takes up the director's helm. ""Wrath of the Titans"" looks more like a series of computer graphic combat sequences than an adventure tale based on Greek mythology. It feels like a video game, where a hero defeats his opponent(s) and proceeds to the next battle. Veterans like Ralph Fiennes, Danny Huston, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy appear, but their roles are mostly forgettable.

Perhaps the best part of the film is the dazzling effects of a gigantic lava dripping Titan. The rest of the film is about the uninteresting hero's endless battles.",1335139200,3,1563,4.824626865671642
4736607,1,B005LAIH5O,"Disclaimer: I love sword and sorcery films.

With this said, this movie seemed to be a grouping of special effects in search of a plot and a script.

There are so many substantive problems with this film that it is difficult to know where to begin.

Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are two of the finest actors of their generation. However, they are given very little to do in this film. Furthermore, their dialogue sounds like it was written by a bored high school student attempting to hurriedly complete a creative writing assignment.

Additionally, the plot has an extremely tenuous relationship with its Greek mythological subject matter. For instance, the three brothers --Hades, Poseidon and Zeus --combined their forces during a decade-long war to defeat and imprison their tyrannical father, Kronos. Apart from being cosimically dangerous, Kronos attempted to murder these men (and all of their sibling) at birth by devouring them. Why this film would have Hades attempting to free his father given their blood-spilling history defies logic. Another example of this is Hades telling Zeus that he was to blame for his banishment in the Underworld. This is completely inaccurate. After Kronos was defeated, the three brothers drew straws to determine who would rule the Sky (Zeus), the Sea (Poseidon) and the Underworld. Hades, the eldest of the three brothers, drew the shortest straw and was left to govern the Underworld which consisted of Heaven (Elysian Fields), Purgatory and Tartarus (Hell). In some versions of the story, Zeus, the youngest brother, made sure that he knew which straw would be the longest, and thus, which territory he would claim. However, there is no Greek folklore that indicated that Hades was displeased with the territory he governed (or the lot he drew, no pun intended). In fact, he was construed to be as distant, stoic and remote as Pluto, the (former) planet named for him. Thus, the movie's premise that Hades harbored a deep hatred for his brothers and could both forgive and side with his father is not particularly credible.

Finally, the movie seems to push its heroes toward fraternal and romantic relationships where there is no need for any. (In fact, their interactions with each other seem forced and gratuitous.) The main characters do not have to like each other. Their mission is to save the world from Kronos -- a titan with a mean streak and the power to shatter the universe.

Are there any positive attributes to the film?

Yes, portions of it look cool.

4736611,3,B005LAIH5O,"I was disappointed with the remake of Clash of the Titans. It updated Ray Harryhausen's outstanding stop-motion animation with CGI more soulless than a clockwork Bubo. The plot was stuffed with irrelevant characters, bad acting, and unnecessary 3D.  Wrath of the Titans learned from all those mistakes.

This is not to say that Wrath of the Titans is a good film. It is an action flick that's much more interested in rivaling God of War's special effects than it is in telling a good story.  But that's okay, because nobody came to see Sam Worthington as Perseus act.  No, we're here to see the gods pontificate: Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and Zeus (Liam Neeson).  With their prayers sapped from the first film the gods are slowly becoming mortal, making death a real possibility.  Hades discovers a solution in the depths of Tartarus; by releasing the imprisoned Kronos, father of the gods, Hades' immortality is assured.

Complicating things is the familial relationships between fathers and sons. Kronos is Zeus' father, Zeus is Perseus' father,and Perseus is widowed with a son ten years after the first film (John Bell as Helius). He is trapped in the mundane life of a fisherman as a promise to his dying wife to never involve his son in warfare. But that is about to change, because the gods can no longer keep Kronos under control.  War is coming to mankind, whether they are ready for it or not.

Cue the giant monsters!  We get a chimera, Cyclopes, Pegasus, the Minotaur, Makhai, and Kronos himself.  Unlike Clash of the Titans, which never bothered to create a sense of dread, none of these monsters immediately appear.  Each is hidden out of sight before making its debut, and we even get Cyclopes Monstervision (a Syfy Channel staple) before we see them in all their savage glory.  Most of them are awesome to behold. The weakest of the bunch is the Minotaur, who just looks like a horned guy with a harelip.

There's also the comedic sidekick Agenor (Toby Kebbell), Andromeda from the first film (Rosamund Pike), and Ares (Edgar Ramirez).  Ramirez is nigh unintelligible thanks to his thick accent and his one emotion - a dreamy gaze that never conveys the rage he supposedly feels for father Zeus and half-brother Perseus.  Considering he is a major villain, he simply can't stand next to Neeson and Fiennes without looking a bit foolish.

Wrath of the Titan's father/son allegories are rivaled only by Green Lantern.  There's a lot of drama here, but the film doesn't have the acting heft to really make it work. But we didn't buy a ticket to watch good acting, we came to see monsters get their butts kicked and in that regard Wrath of the Titans delivers in spades.  This is a monster film that stays true to the spirit of Harryhausen's vision, and if you squint it's easy to see his influence on the design of the Cyclopes and the chimera.

Dangerously weakened by humanity's lack of devotion, the gods are losing control of the imprisoned Titans and their ferocious leader, Kronos, father of the long-ruling brothers Zeus, Hades and Poseidon. The triumvirate had overthrown their powerful father long ago, leaving him to rot in the gloomy abyss of Tartarus, a dungeon that lies deep within the cavernous underworld. Perseus cannot ignore his true calling when Hades, along with Zeus' godly son, Ares, switch loyalties and make a deal with Kronos to capture Zeus. The Titans' strength grows stronger as Zeus' remaining godly powers are siphoned, and hell is unleashed on earth. Enlisting the help of the warrior Queen Andromeda, Poseidon's demigod son, Argenor, and fallen god Hephaestus, Perseus bravely embarks on a treacherous quest into the underworld to rescue Zeus, overthrow the Titans and save mankind.

The cast led by Sam Worthington (as Perseus) is pretty good. The directing by Jonathan Liebesman is pretty good. The story by Dan Mazeau, David Johnson & Greg Berlanti & the screenplay by Mazeau & Johnson is pretty good.

The music by Javier Navarrete is great. The cinematography by Ben Davis is great. The film editing by Martin Walsh is great. The casting by Jina Jay is great. The production design by Charles Wood is great. The art direction by Thomas Brown, Ray Chan, Jordan Crockett, Stuart Kearns, Mike Stallion & Mark Swain is great. The set decoration by Lee Sandales is great. The costume design by Jany Temime is great. The special effects supervised by Neil Corbould is great. The make-up effects designed by Paul Engelen is great.

This is a pretty good sequel to ""Clash Of The Titans"" (2010). It is a little bit better than the first movie. This is an action-packed ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing at the same time.",1333152000,2,2211,4.843915343915344
