6568028,3,B00MCAH9Z0,"Well to begin with, I must say that Metallica is the greatest metal band of all time, PERIOD!
O' MY GOD! These shows are insane. A must have for every musician!

On the other hand, I was a little bit disappointed that the mexico city CD's were audio only (no video!!!)
That seriously sucks! At the very least they should mention it on the website so that you know what you are buying!

So, watch out and don't be deceived as I was.",1413417600,,431,4.180722891566265

6568047,5,B00MCAH9Z0,"A large amount of DVD content, really great stuff, especially given that it's a DVD as opposed to Blu-Ray. Sound quality was great, and has a lot of additional features. CD is nice too, but with streaming services now-a-days I've had access to the Mexico City concert for years, so that wasn'tthe intent of my purchase. Overall, DVDs are absolutely awesome (over 6 hours of footage)!",1461628800,3,383,4.818181818181818
6568048,3,B00MCAH9Z0,"As with the original VHS release; the audio is poorly done and has a distinct treble bias.  You can EQ it down, but it still isn't as good as it should have been.  Video is fine.  It's a shame because it was a grand moment in time for Metallica's career, but the audio just ruins the experience.",1457395200,,295,4.140350877192983
6568049,5,B00MCAH9Z0,"Great price for this nice set, I was so glad when I found that this set was available I this very affordable price.
Even it does not comes with the big metal box that was originally released.
This is a treasure, specially for people who became fans of Metallica in the late 80's and early 90's. Even though there is no HD version of this concerts (because it was released on early 90's on VHS originally) it is great because it brings you back to those years, when Metallica was a very impressive band, with a lot of power on Lars's drums. Also you can watch Jason N. on the bass, I love that line up with him.
This is a great gift for new Metallica fans too, so that they can watch the best Metallica Years.",1455321600,5,708,4.175182481751825

6568052,5,B00MCAH9Z0,Finally I own it. Since its release i always wanted this box set. Highly recomended is the metallica i like. .... And justice for all and black album on tour. Three different venues!,1447977600,3,182,4.545454545454546
6568053,5,B00MCAH9Z0,"Great bargain for what amounts to 3 concerts and 8 1/2 hours of live Metallica in their prime. It's as close as you can get to seeing them live, short of buying a front row ticket!",1447804800,5,180,4.027777777777778
6568054,5,B00MCAH9Z0,Great video!!,1445299200,,13,6.0
6568055,5,B00MCAH9Z0,"This is by far the single best concert box set ever to be made and sold ever.  Metallica is in my viewpoint is the best metal band ever to live and put out music for their fans.  This box set finishes my Metallica collection but took me many days to get threw the whole box set because it is a CD's of Mexico City concert, then two DVD'S of their other concerts in San Diego and other one in Seattle.  Now Amazon lists this box set as 300 minutes long which is 5 hours the DVD'S are actually 5 hours and 41 minutes long for those concets.  If you inculde the 3 CD's of the Mexico City concert that comes to 8 hours and 41 minutes of this Metallica music concert box set.  So I agree totally this is only for die hardcore Metallica fans because of how long this box set is.  But after watching the live concerts on DVD and listening to the live CD's my mouth was so totally on the floor from how amazing their preformances were for each concert.  Plus some behind the scenes footage and on the Mexico City preformance had two songs just over 18 minutes long each.  In closing if your a true fan of Metallica as I am and collect all their stuff then buy this box set because it's only 25 dollars for 3 CD's and 2 DVD'S you can never ever beat that price.",1442534400,16,1252,4.081632653061225

6568058,5,B00MCAH9Z0,"I originally bought this years ago when it was the full size box set, but over the years I had either lost parts of it or had parts stolen. I saw it here for a much lower price than I paid last time and it is a more compact set with the same contents. It is an amazing set of live footage, stencil, booklet, etc. Every Metallica fan should own this!",1437264000,15,349,3.9295774647887325

6568063,5,B00MCAH9Z0,"The Seattle concert is without a doubt the very best live Metallica recorded.  If you have never experienced ""pre-black album"" Metallica live, this will change you.  It is the Metallica of old that all us ""bitter fans"" talk about.  The original boxed set was just shy of $100 back in the 90s and was worth every penny.  All this for $25 is insane.  After 20 plus years, two kids, three jobs, and 5 moves my originals have disappeared.  It had to be replaced.  This is a no brainer for any Metallica fan new or old.",1429142400,26,514,4.347368421052631

6568067,3,B00MCAH9Z0,"For years I never had this package in my collection...having said that, I understand now why I was reluctant to purchase this package all those years ago...Metallica at this point had became  mega ""rockstars""  subjecting themselves to exclusively""entertaining"" to a mass of large mainstream rock audience,( maybe you cant blame them for wanting to make money, it was and is better than ""working"" at a planet enslaving industry like Walmart ) however I digress, Enter Sandman did spell the end of a certain era within Metallica, the song itself however, is not the worst song ever,but by the same token,it is certainly not the be all end all song it was sometimes believed to be. The ""Black Album"" performances are rushed and some songs do not get full treatment,the constant ""high in the mix"" cheers of the audience really only conveys an image that people are witnessing the return of a god, is particularly awful and as annoying as Lars tin can snaredrum on the St Anger album. You want to like Metallica but up until, really the Death Magnetic album,it has been a difficult and way too long of a hard ride. It remains sadly ironic that they grew into such a huge band, based on really malnourished material. From 1991 until 2007 you will find ""good"" Metallica songs but not great Metallica albums,they are talented musicians to say the least,but sometimes it seems you can ride on brandname recognition longer than is necessary.",1424476800,,1431,4.836734693877551
