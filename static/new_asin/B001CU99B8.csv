8289859,5,B001CU99B8,"This is the very best of the reportage on this grisly horror to date, but I think the definitive documentary is yet to be made. I can't imagine how they could make a dramatized movie...",1467417600,,185,4.314285714285714
8289860,5,B001CU99B8,"This is about serial killer Herb Baumeister. He murdered men who were homosexuals, but managed to hide that life from his wife and kids. Many people say they would've suspected something. However, you have to consider how good he got at hiding things including his victims. He got caught because one of his victims go away. The victim saw his car and gave the police the license plate. From there, it was just a manner of time before he was arrested. His wife was truly surprised at what they found. This is just a really good documentary about a serial killer who hasn't gotten the press as other serial killers. If you are into true crime or criminal justice, this is a good documentary that follows the entire story from start to finish.",1397520000,,740,4.571428571428571
