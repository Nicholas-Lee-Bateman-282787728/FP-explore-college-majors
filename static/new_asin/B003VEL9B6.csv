8501756,5,B003VEL9B6,"If you've heard any of Aquiles recordings with Angra or Hangar, you will have noticed (especially if you're a drummer) his very clinical, precise and hard-hitting style. It differs from the playing style of other drummers within the metal-, and in this case, power metal genre. Check out for instance the drumming on this Angra track, Spread your fire: [...]. He's so persuasive and articulate with each hit, and of course everything is timed just right, also when it's fast. This has made him one of my favorite drummers.

This DVD contains a set of songs recorded live in studio by Aquiles on a beautiful kit, all professionally filmed. But what really excites me is learning some of the secrets to his approach. Most of it is of course hard work, but he has also developed a different way of holding the drumsticks, something I've noticed before, but never realized he does for a good reason. I wanted to learn ""how he does it"", and I feel I have. That doesn't mean I've learnt to do the same, that would take lots of time and effort, but it has helped me on my way as a drummer.

This guy auditioned for Dream Theater, and I was glad to see him as one of the few they had chosen to check out. I've always felt that if DT needed someone sitting in for Mike Portnoy, like for a tour or something, he'd be the one, because playing wise it would just feel like it was Mike at the top of his game. I do however agree with DTs choice of Mike Mangini, as he is more diverse.

This disc has excellent sound and picture quality, and if you're in to Aquiles drumming, you should probably just get it.",1306281600,2,1594,4.36026936026936

I'm a bass guitar player, but I got this anyway since is quite impressive to watch him. Aquiles was one of the 7 candidates  to join Dream Theatre as a new drummer, and this DVD is the reason why he was called to audition.",1305849600,,265,4.408163265306122
