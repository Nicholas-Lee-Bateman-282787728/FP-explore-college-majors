8125227,5,B000FOQ04G,"This is a great collection. Parents might want to preview some of the stories for appropriateness for your child. Some of the stories were a little scary for our 3 year old, but they might not be for another child.",1263081600,,214,4.375
8125228,5,B000FOQ04G,This is a must-have. Vol. 1 is also a must-have. These are classics and your kids will love 'em all!,1222041600,,100,4.05
8125229,2,B000FOQ04G,I thought there would be more than one Curious George DVD. Most of the titles I had never heard of and my 2yr old didn't like them either.,1215820800,,138,3.9642857142857144
8125230,5,B000FOQ04G,My children love seeing their favorite books come to life on the screen!  These videos are also a great way to discover classics and newly released books that interest them as well.  We've purchased several books that the children originally fell in love with in this series!,1212364800,,275,4.829787234042553
8125231,5,B000FOQ04G,"My wifes 2 1/2 year old grand niece is fighting agressive leukhemia and asks for Curious George often. We saw this on Amazon and knew she would love it. Her days are long and difficult and this little Monkey is a happy friend. Her pleasure is sincere, and I would recommend this set for any child.",1192579200,2,297,4.321428571428571
8125232,5,B000FOQ04G,"All three of my kids (boys 7, 3, 1.75) LOVE these videoe.  We put one on before bed and depending on how ""on or ""off"" schedule we are, I can choose the right number of shows for them to watch.  They are pretty short, which is nice...my kids always want to watch a movie to the end, which can be a problem at night.  Our favorite by far is ""Goodnight Gorilla"".  They have done a superb job animating these lovely story books...you will not be sorry!",1179014400,7,448,4.174418604651163
8125233,5,B000FOQ04G,"My children absolutely love it when we read them Wheels on the Bus and Good Night Gorilla.  I am not fond of providing video to my children but when it is basically the book that I just read to them... I gave in. Not only do they love to see the video but then they want to read me the book.  I had to buy the other books on the video because my child wanted to read them to me as well.  So now I have Dem Bones and I know an Old Lady that Swallowed a Fly, to name of few others.  I think the ones that have music associated with the book really speak to my children the most but overall the collection is a must!",1173312000,10,613,3.765625
8125234,1,B000FOQ04G,I was not happy with this collection at all. Would not recommend it to anyone.,1168300800,,78,4.266666666666667
