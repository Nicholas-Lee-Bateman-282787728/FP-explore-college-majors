4148850,5,B003L7DK74,Bought for husband. Weird off beat NZ comedy. Stupid funny kind of things,1431475200,,73,4.6923076923076925
4148851,5,B003L7DK74,"I loved What We Do In the Shadows and so it naturally led me to reappraise this show. I absolutely love it. Clement's humor can be silly, smart, layered, sometimes all in one episode. It also feels new, like something you haven't seen before. Because of that, it might take a couple of episodes to get into the Conchords groove. Once this happens, though, once you're along for the ride, the show becomes hilarious. Really hilarious. The ""rewatchability"" factor is pretty high, too! What's not to like?",1430956800,,502,4.781609195402299

4148854,5,B003L7DK74,"It is always a hard statement to back up when you say something or someone is the greatest ever. Opinions are subjective. However, I would dare say that there has never been a show funnier than this one. I don't always go crazy for the music, but the comedy is as good as it gets. Jermaine and Bret are the best. Murray and Dave are also the two greatest supporting characters ever, and then you have Doug and Mel. What a show!",1425686400,,427,4.219512195121951

8399614,5,B003L7DK74,"Watched this first on HBO, loved it so much bought the DVDs, and have rewatched it many times since my purchase back in 2013. Great series, worth having. There is an extra of the two performing on stage some of the songs from their show. Great buy and nice little box case it comes in.",1502409600,,285,4.2
8399615,5,B003L7DK74,Brett McKenzie and Jemaie Clement are both highly entertaining and talented individuals.  Combining music with comedy there is a harmony to this brand of humor.  Made for those who love parody's.,1499040000,,195,5.258064516129032
8399616,3,B003L7DK74,"I used to love this series. Then I watched a couple episodes with my lady, and she pointed out that their whole shtick is to be emotionless. I realized she was exactly right, and rather than admit that, I never watched it with her again. I still secretly enjoy it though, if only to see Jemaine and Bret suffer.",1497657600,,311,4.288135593220339
8399617,5,B003L7DK74,Great comedy - very dry and clever. Surprised they did not become more popular.,1491436800,,79,4.714285714285714

8399620,5,B003L7DK74,5 stars for the show.  I star for the packaging.  The show is great and the I thoroughly enjoy watching it again.  The package come with a stain on the box but under the shrink wrap.  Appears as if it was opened and then resealed since I cannot imagine any other way to stain the box while sealed.,1471737600,,297,4.068965517241379
8399621,5,B003L7DK74,One of the funniest shows ever and the complete series is cheaper than buying each season plus it comes with a live dvd.,1470873600,,120,4.260869565217392
8399622,5,B003L7DK74,"I am a big Flight of the Conchords fan, and recently realized that I do not have a copy of their show.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find a blu-ray variation and had to settle for the DVD.  While the picture quality is not as great as a blu-ray would be, the show quality is just as hilarious as I remembered it.  If you are a fan of any comedies such as Arrested Development, 30 Rock, Parks and Rec, etc., you will probably enjoy this as much as I do.  Every episode is a musical, and each song has its own humorous element.  I believe that this show is one of the best shows that aired on HBO (sorry, Game of Thrones).  Excellent comedy and worth the buy!",1466985600,,659,4.109375
8399623,5,B003L7DK74,"Hilarious! This is a great set, and I ended up binge watching the whole thing.",1459209600,,78,4.266666666666667
