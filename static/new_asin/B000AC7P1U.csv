2384364,1,B000AC7P1U,THIS MOVIE IS SO F*****G TERRIBLE.  HOW COULD ANYBODY IN THERE RIGHT STATE OF MIND LIKE IT.  ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING TO LIKE AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!,1165536000,2,137,4.913043478260869
2384365,5,B000AC7P1U,"First thing is, that if you don't like good foreign films with english subtitles just skip this one. Made in Spain,the first movie Plaga Zombie took this guys 4 years to make during weekends with the help of their friends, kinda like American Movie. A temendous effort and a hell of a fight against mutant zombies for a medical student a nerd and a wrestler . But Mutant Zone is way better. Just starting a day after the first  and kinda making no sense of what really happened to John West (the wrestler makes this movie even funnier).The special effects and fight scenes are not top notch but they are good and hillarious as well. A must for any zombie fan!!!",1152403200,7,661,4.462809917355372
2384366,1,B000AC7P1U,"In a few words, this film sucks!  Please don't waste your hard earned money on it.  The quality, story-line, and acting are so bad, they aren't even funny.  I can't even believe that they made a sequel.  If you want to see a good Latin horror movie, try 'The Devil's Backbone' or 'Thesis'.",1145404800,4,289,4.39622641509434
2384367,5,B000AC7P1U,"What a blast! I had the chance to see Zona Mutante at MALBA back in 2002 and I couldn't be happier to have both masterpieces in my collection. This 2 movies are the true work of fans that have become masters themselves. Though they claim they love and visually evoke the early days of Peter Jackson and Sam Raimi, the guys from FARSA have their own trademark style and camera moves, and most important a fresh way of storytelling, that recently has traspassed to their successfull works for music videoclips.

But personally I believe that their true signature is not visual but in the commitment they have to deliver an great product and a heartfelt story.

Though the movie takes place in their hometown neighbourhood, that doesn't stop the movie to be epical, gory, funny and entretaining. The extras on the DVDs are great,the commentarys are funny and the documentary shows how complicated and excrusiating it was to make this 2 features. Also because of this documentary, on a different level this movie serves as an excellent way to drive people with interest in genre to dare to make their own movies.

This is an excellent movie to enjoy with friends, and everytime I see it makes me wonder when will we see the final battle for humanity onscreen with a 3rd movie. Kudos to the FARSA guys, you should be proud for such a great couple of movies. Hope to see more of you REALLY SOON.They love trilogies, I know they won't dissapoint us. 1, 2, ...3",1140825600,4,1453,4.624031007751938
2384368,5,B000AC7P1U,"This DVD gives you both Plaga Zombie and it's sequel, Plaga Zombie: Mutant Zone.

Both movies are incredible. Beautiful music, wonderful gore, great comedy. The zombies aren't strict zombies. They behave more like the deadites of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness. But that's fine, because it's funny and there's still plenty of gore.

The story is basically this: Three friends have to survive a town filled with crazy, rambunctious zombies.

There's a little more to it than that, but that's all I really need to love it. The nuances just improve it that much more.",1139184000,9,566,4.814432989690721
2384369,5,B000AC7P1U,"I bought this movie thinking ""Might be Entertaining"" since I buy every Zombie movie I come across... When I got home and realized that this movie was a ""Spanish"" movie I was expecting the worse in a bad way. I can't speak or read Spanish so I have any idea what the movie is really about. The DVD comes standard with Sub-Tiles but I gave it a shot always without them. Turns out this Movie ROCKS. It's Gory, Great Music, It's Humorous, It's plain nasty and I just love everything about this Movie, Even the fact that I can't understand one word in the entire movie besides ""Amigo"" and the Names of the Characters. I think that factor even makes this Hilarious Zombie Movie even that more unique and entertaining. Granted I adore all the Classics Fulci, Romero & even Bruno Mattei for ripping off DOTD so badly. I can ballpark the plot for you: 3 Dudes get adducted by the F.B.I. whore are working with Aliens in some kind of scheme or another. The 3 Dudes are then dumped in a city of Zombies(Who are each Brightly Colored in Neon Green, Orange, Red, Blue, Pink, Yellow and every other neon variant) They get in allot of action fights with the Zombies and do all kinds of crazy stuff. All Gory, All Funny... The End, You Just saw a Funny Gory Zombie Movie and you have no idea what it was about. Works for me.

Great Ganja Movie, But now that damn ""John West"" song is burned in my brain and I can't get that melody out of my skull.",1132444800,,1431,4.3
2384370,3,B000AC7P1U,"I would put this in a category with Dead Alive and Dead & Breakfast, in the sense that Plaga Zombie is very gory and the humor besides 3 parts or so that were supose to be funny were not at all, as for the rest was actually pretty damn funny and had me laughjing especially the Jonny west sing along ( sounds stupid but was funny as hell ).

The Zombies in this movie are alll different colors being Green, Blue, Yellow, white etc. With alot of the skin just looking basically very decayed and rotted and in some cases like an oat meal type face, but it works great. As for the Gore it is top notch the make up effects are excellent and some of the best i have seen in a while and this movie relys basically on all make up effects and no CGI a little here and there but it is great looking.

Overall if you like movies like Dead Alive, Dead & Breakfast, Evil Dead 2 then you will definitly like this . It is a movie not to be taken serious and is just a comedy with lots of gore. For $13 on amazon but $10 in best buy this is way worth having in any collection just a funny bloody mess well done movie.

Destined to probably be a cult classic, IMO atleast.",1130716800,3,1156,3.9956709956709955
2384371,3,B000AC7P1U,"Not A bad little Zombie movie....If you don't mind reading subtitles (it was filmed in Argentina, So the Audio is in Spanish)But I guess it's worth the price, since you get two DVD's...part one and part two ""Mutant Zone""! They are low Budget, but you can tell they had a bigger budget for part 2 ""Mutant Zone"". Part 2 starts right were part one left off, so its like one long movie. (The production values on part 2 are Superior to part one.) The movie itself is more 'Slapstick' and the Gore is Extremeley over the top...Like in Peter Jackson's ""BRAINDEAD""(aka ""DEAD ALIVE""). Lots of Zombies, and loads of Gore!!! The Zombies come in all different types...blue, green, white, red, oatmeal faced. Some look pretty cheesy, but for some reason it works. Some of the things the Zombies do are pretty funny, and you can tell they are spoofing some of the classic zombie movies. Their are also some some scenes that will get you... the intestine scene is definately unique, and had me rollin on the floor with laughter, and Disgust! There are some scenes that try to hard to be funny, but overall I enjoyed both movies and will keep them in my collection. I havn't seen this for rent anywhere, so I think you will have to buy it if you want to check it out...but $13 bucks ain't bad for 2 Zombie Flix!",1130371200,7,1296,4.472573839662447
8077617,5,B000AC7P1U,"This is part 1 and 2. and both are fun"". glad I bought them. thank you..xx",1444089600,,74,3.6875
8077618,4,B000AC7P1U,"i loved this movie...ok i admitt it is a cheaply funded b movie, but, it was like watching evil dead 1 and 2...hilarious.....the gross out gags with the zombies were fantastic!

this disc set came with movies 1 and 2 , and i recommend all zombie fans adding this to their library.",1301097600,,280,4.384615384615385
8077619,5,B000AC7P1U,"Usually I hate zombie movies shot for $200 by teenagers using mom and dad's camcorder, but this movie is just amazingly awesome.  Words can't even describe it.  Just buy the d@mn disc, and you will see what I mean.",1291766400,,214,4.461538461538462
8077620,5,B000AC7P1U,my 5 stars goes towards the hard work a bunch of young guys performed that made me laugh. gore infused in the cheapest way. brilliant? no. 3 of the 5 go to the fact that it is not a great movie and doesnt pretend to be. if u didn't like it you have a very limited view on what movie making and art is about. hollywood is not the only way to tell your story. ty for your time.,1276646400,,375,3.759493670886076
8077621,4,B000AC7P1U,"I ordered these movies (there are 2 Movie DVDs in this, the original and the sequel) some years ago after seeing a preview that looked pretty good.. I didn't realize this was 2 movies at first.
The first movie is kind of slow to start with but finishes pretty well even with very low budget effects. I'd give it a 3 star review. The second film one is my Top 10 Zombie pics of all time and I'm giving my review a 4 because of it. It truly shows what can be done even with a low budget.

*If your looking for a ""serious"" zombie flick, your not going to enjoy this as it is a comedy. The humor here is similar to Dead Alive or Evil Dead.

*Anyone who thinks this is the worst zombie film ever, has not watched many zombie films and probably wouldn't enjoy 99% of them anyway.

*It's in Spanish with English subtitles. I've loaned this movie out a few times, and most everyone who's seen it.. liked it!

It's my understanding that these are the first zombie flicks from Argentina.",1268956800,,977,4.236559139784946
8077622,1,B000AC7P1U,"This must be the worst film of all time.i bought this because of some of the 5 star reviews people gave it.
how can anyone think this is good? acting,plot,effects all terrible.
AVOID!!!! 0 OUT 0F 5",1244764800,,197,4.351351351351352
8077623,1,B000AC7P1U,"don't buy this garbage... 30 minutes into this, it was the worst movie i ever saw in my life. and i've  seen alot of movies. in no way is it funny or action packed or anything... don't waste your money or your time.",1227657600,,215,4.0
8077624,5,B000AC7P1U,"I can't believe this doesn't have a bunch of 5-star ratings!  Travesty!  This movie is hilarious with great low-budget gore effects.  The writing, acting, everything is done with great love and care.  This is NOT a slap-dash amateur effort.  You can see that they have a small budget, but it is also clear that they made every possible effort to compensate for this and made a fun movie that zombie fans would enjoy watching.  I own this movie and have watched it many times.

Cannot.  Recommend.  Highly.  Enough.  So much fun.  Seriously.  If you love Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive (Brain Dead), Black Sheep, or Body Melt, you will love Plaga Zombie.",1220140800,,652,4.663716814159292
8077625,1,B000AC7P1U,"Love zombie flicks, and like to watch low-budget zombie films. But this movie straight out SUCKS. Bad story-line  that makes no sense, silly plot, bad actors, overall a waste of time. Don't rent and don't buy, unless you like throwing away money. Don't let the one star fool you, I had to give it that, in order to post my review.",1192838400,2,330,4.409836065573771
8077626,1,B000AC7P1U,"Do you like zombie movies?
Of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't be here.
But do you like piss-poor make-up design,
God-awful special effects & horrendous lighting?
Probably not.

The best thing I can say about this flick is that it comes with 2 discs.
The first (Plaga Zombie)is almost certainly a college project.(So I won't comment further on that one.
But the second disc (Plaga Zombie: Mutant Zone) should have been better since it was the follow-up with a bigger (I assume) budget.

Anyways;
The music was  a little over-exaggerated and seemed like it was trying to make this flick more serious than it really was. (Except the ""John West"" song, which I still find myself singing. In fact that whole scene is the best part of the movie.) When it comes to zombie comedies, you can do alot better than this one. (ie: Dead-Alive, Return of the living Dead Part 2, Shaun of the Dead) Don't get me wrong, the directors have potential. But that potential would be better geared toward slap-stick comedies, not horror comedies.

Just a Side Note:
The main attraction of any zombie flick is the undeads prosthetic make-up.(Peeling Flesh/Half-Eaten Lips/Severed limbs and Disembodied torsos/ etc.)
Suffice to say, Absolutely none of these zombies even so much as resembled zombies. (or acted like zombies for that matter). They look more like college kids after Halloween night.

MORAL OF THE STORY:  Time & Money are Precious Commodities.
  To Waste Them on this Flick is Criminal.",1175126400,6,1481,4.919678714859438
