2021201,4,B0001NBMHQ,"""The Hunters"" (1958) and ""The Enemy Below"" (1957) are 2 war movies produced by Dick Powell for 20th Century Fox filmed in Cinemascope both with Robert Mitchum in the leading role.
Major Cleve Saville (Robert Mitchum), the squadron commander, is a famous ace and veteran fighter pilot of World War II. He is a career man whose world was his squadron and the men who flew with him. Lt. Pell (Robert Wagner), in the early part of the movie, is a reckless but eventually courageous young jet ace to whom Saville owe his life. Lt. Abbott (Lee Phillips) is the confused husband of Kris (May Britt) whom Saville falls in love with although their acknowledged desires are never to be fulfilled.
The picture is based on the novel ""The Hunters"" by James Salter who is himself a jet ace in the Korean conflict. In the late 50's long before the development of CGI technology, real fighter jets F-86 Sabrejet and F-84 Thunderjets (painted gray with a red star to simulate MIG-15) were flown in the aerial battle sequence which made it the more realistic than Pearl Harbor (2001).
I have kept like a treasure a copy of ""The Hunters"" VHS tape and it is pretty worn out by now from years of repeated viewings. Thank you Fox for putting it on DVD...46 years after its theatrical release.",1085011200,19,1270,4.599118942731278

2021235,4,B0001NBMHQ,Dated but decent war film. A very young Robert Wagner and somewhat over weight Robert Mitchum play student and mentor in this high flying Korean conflict adventure Some good dialogue between them.. Well done noncombat portion of story to make things interesting at ground level. Recall seeing as a kid (first run) and was entranced with all the flying parts. I suppose it was the Top Gun of its day.,1485820800,,399,4.714285714285714
2021236,4,B0001NBMHQ,Great flying combat scenes.  F86 was a top fighter in USAF.,1483574400,,59,4.363636363636363

2021240,4,B0001NBMHQ,"Chances are pretty good that you've only ever seen this movie on TV or maybe VHS -- grainy and cropped 3:2 format.  So it was for me, the first time seeing this in the original widescreen format and with a nice sharp print in HD.  You have to expect a certain number of cliches with war pics like this. But overall it was quite watchable with a great cast, headed by the always solid Robert Mitchum.  And best of all, there are plenty of flying scenes with F-86 Sabres, in the right color schemes, filmed expressly for this movie (and not the usual ""stock footage"" used in so many lower budget films of the time).  The enemy MIG's are portrayed by repainted F-84 Thunderstreaks which are a very passable substitute and certainly better than models.",1476403200,2,748,4.518518518518518

2021243,4,B0001NBMHQ,I am a plane nut and the F86 shots are great. The romance is dry and quirky in a pre-60's way. Too bad they couldn't spring for some Mig 17's.,1475798400,,142,3.7666666666666666

2021247,5,B0001NBMHQ,"Straight from 1958. Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner (so young) in what just became one of my very favorite war movies. The acting, and that includes the entire support cast is GREAT. The aerial sequences are wonderful and the story is different for a change. the dialog is engrossing and will leave you wanting more at all times. this takes place during the Korean war for a change of pace. Robert Mitchum is the squadron leader and he has a new hotshot flyer under his command and there is the complication of a fellow flyers wife! I will admit though that the Robert Wagner ""hepcat"" talk got under my skin at times but still well worth the time to watch this movie. the comeraderie that becomes evident in the last half hour is uplifting.",1470096000,3,741,4.537313432835821

2021262,1,B0001NBMHQ,"The movie version is an insult to the work of the author of the original book.  Robert Mitchum is truly a bad actor, always has been but his lack of talent shines here.  Robert Wagner's character is ridiculous.  A pilot of his demeanour would have never seen flight time back in the 50's.  The script is cornball to the hilt.  The only high points of the movie are the flight scenes of the F-86.  There's really nothing else to say about this piece of trash.",1447113600,,458,4.329411764705882

2021307,4,B0001NBMHQ,"Thoroughly average story with far better than average flight scenes. Instead of relying on models and gun-camera and other stock footage, they actually shot combat scenes from an airplane using F-86s for the good guys and F-84Fs for the bad guys. That suspension-of-disbelief aside, the shots of Sabre operations are interesting. The rest of the film, the personal conflicts, the romantic scenes? Use the FF button.",1418774400,,415,5.303030303030303
2021308,4,B0001NBMHQ,"It's just as good as ""The Bridges at Toko-Ri,"" sort of.  Same war: screenplay, direction, cinematography, casting and acting, all excellent.  The real star is the F-86 Sabrejet, our first generation swept-wing jet fighter, and as photogenic as it was effective in its role of air-to-air combat.  Add Mitchum at his inscrutable tough-guy best, plus an outstanding supporting cast, throw in a well-focused story, and the result is a fine film indeed.
  What does it lack, aside from Mickey Rooney?  It lacks the drama of aircraft carrier launches and recoveries, but the F-86 was strictly a runway-based airplane, and for good reasons.  I think my excuse for withholding the five-star rating is that when this film is inevitably compared to ""Bridges,"" it doesn't have the same punch somehow.
  Jemes Michener, author of that novel but not this one, digs deeper into human nature than this story tries to.  Maybe you'll see this when you watch the film.  Don't get me wrong: it is still a great story, and I recommend it.  It will stay in my collection.  Hey, the Air Force was my service, and my father's before me.",1418515200,,1113,4.825396825396825

2021318,4,B0001NBMHQ,I enjoyed this movie. The flying scenes are excellent and really showcase the Sabre jet. I only issue I have with it is I thought the Robert Wagner character was a little over the top. Fighter pilots normally show more discipline than the Wagner character did in the movie. The story line is good and keeps your interest. Korean war movies are harder to find these days and this is one of the better ones.,1412035200,,405,4.413333333333333

2021326,2,B0001NBMHQ,"James Salter's book, ""The Hunters"", is far superior to the movie. So much was changed that I barely recognized it. A lot of the inner exploration of the lead pilot was deleted. Thus we are left with a rather sappy story.",1408579200,,220,4.390243902439025
2021327,5,B0001NBMHQ,"One of the best Korean War/Air Force movies I've seen. just the right amount of drama, action, and suspense to keep the story moving. Several of the stars were in their early stages of their careers - it's fun to see them at that time.

Plus, the beautiful F-86 in action! Second only to the P-51 in beauty. And both made by North American. By comparison, the drab bazillion per unit fighters produced today are.....uninspiring.

Great aerial battle sequences and the Republic F-84's served very convincingly as Migs.

But when Mitchum crashed landed his plane in an attempt to save his unrequited lover's husband and actually saved him, it all fell apart. I'm not capable of suspending disbelief to that level. ""The Bridges at Toko Ri"" has a more realistic take on this sort of scenario.

Still, fun to watch. For once Beta male trumps Alpha male, even if it's by default. Director Dick Powell did a much better job with ""The Enemy Below"". Also staring Mitchum. Check it out!",1375315200,,912,4.6875
2021358,3,B0001NBMHQ,"The real star of this very good war movie is the F86 Sabre, which has to be the most beautiful, perfect looking jet fighter ever designed.  This film is about Sabre versus MIG in the Korean War.  Robert Mitchum, Robert Wagner, and Richard Egan are all combat jet pilots squaring off against the Communist MIGs in tough aerial combat in Korea.
The best part of the film centers on the combat and the interplay of strong personalities.  Mitchum plays the taciturn, highly-skilled leader, Robert Wagner is a new hot-shot pilot with maturing to do, and Egan is the Squadron commander.  The interplay of these personalities makes for a pretty good war flick, and the aerial combat scenes are first rate even by today's standards.  Again, enough cannot be said about the beauty of the F86 Sabre, an all-time classic jet fighter.
Hollywood rarely can make a movie without some sort of romantic element, and this is far and away the weakest part of the film.  There is an absurd love triangle element to the film which in my view falls flat.  The dialog is incurably sappy and many viewers will be tempted to fast forward through it.

2021372,4,B0001NBMHQ,"This is a quite nice little war movie about a group of American fighter pilots during Korean War. It is an adaptation of a novel, ""The Hunters"" by James Salter. I admit that I didn't read the book, but it has very good reviews - and most people stress the point that it is much better than the film.

The story is relatively simple. A renowned fighter pilot, World War II ace and instructor (we know he spend years as member of US military mission to Greece, training local pilots), major Cleve Saville (Robert Mitchum), is affected to a squadron of F-86 Sabres in Korea. He is part of a wave of reinforcements destined to ""harden"" fighter units, after the Chinese send to the front improved versions of MiG-15, manned by pilots who recently underwent an intensive upgrading training in Soviet Union. Major Saville will command a flight of four F-86. His three subalterns are Lieutenant Corona (John Gabriel), an almost supernaturally calm young pilot; Lieutenant Abbott (Lee Philips), a courageous man but with quite serious issues; and finally Lieutenant Pell (Robert Wagner), an amazingly skilled and almost pathologically brave pilot, but also an absolute ""pain in the neck"" in every other aspect...

The day of his arrival in Japan and just before being shipped to Korea, major Saville meets a somehow mysterious young Norvegian woman and becomes instantly fascinated by her - and the attraction is mutual, at least to some extent. And then, just before things go too far, he learns, that this young woman is actually the wife of his wingman, Lt. Abbott...

All of that happens in the first minutes of the film - and from that moment on, the story progresses on two fronts (sorry, I couldn't resist). First, there is the war in the airs over the Yalu river, with the F-86 keeping watch over the bombing and close-support missions in support of United Nations troops in the peninsula. And then there is a much subtler (but almost as dangerous) game of attraction/rejection, suggestion/manipulation, seduction/transaction, ""catch me if you can"", etc., between major Saville and Kristina Abbott...

The character of ""Kriss"" Abbott is a very, very interesting one. Swedish actress May Britt (she later married Sammy Davis Jr, after converting to Judaism) plays her with great skill - and she also gives her character a very special accent (supposedly Norvegian), which makes things even MORE interesting! It is a special charm of those older films, that women played extremely dangerous, mysterious, almost snakelike vixens, when in the same time maintaining on the surface the demeanor of perfect ladies... The tensions rising around the triangle ""Saville/Abbott/his wife"" are also a very interesting thing to watch.

As you can see by simply looking at the cover of the DVD, things will finally have to land somewhere - and it will be a very harsh landing for some... I will not provide spoilers here, but the second part of the film is quite surprising - and no, it is not by mistake, that in a film about fighter pilots one of the characters is shown in dirty infantry winter clothing, holding a Soviet-made PPSh-41 sub-machine gun (weapon used in Korean war by many North Korean and Chinese soldiers...). The ending is not easy and not exactly as we could expect it - and I will say nothing more about it.

The success of the film was probably helped by a good working relation between Mitchum and the director, Dick Powell. For most of his career an actor in musicals, he started directing only in the middle of the 50s and in 1957 he and Robert Mitchum made together ""The enemy below"", one of the best and most tense war films about submarines. This complicity certainly helped them to make ""The hunters"" into a fairly good film. Sadly, their cooperation ended soon after, as Powell felt grievously ill and finally after a courageous battle died from cancer in 1963.

A special mention goes to the images of air combats - they are quite well done, for a film made in 1958. For lack of genuine MiG-15 fighters, the director used Republic F-84 Thunderstreaks, American fighters looking a little like those famous Soviet planes, which missed the Korean War by a couple of months. Multinational character of United Nations troops is underlined - and the images of Japan in the Year of Grace 1953 are also quite interesting.

So all in all, although not really an immortal masterpiece, this is a very honest, quite interesting war film. I spend a nice evening watching it - and it is a MUST for all fans of Robert Mitchum! Enjoy!",1339372800,,4532,4.816195372750642

But, I first saw the movie soon after it was released; my Dad took me-- and the big attraction to him was that during the Korean War he had actually met the F-86 driver who was the basis for Lt. Pell. In his opinion, Wagner was just like the real guy.  Some time after that there was a get together at our house where several more USAF pilots talked over the movie-- at least one other either knew him or knew of him, and agreed in that opinion.  I no longer remember the original ""Pell's"" name, but did hear. So, don't be too critical of that portrayal! By the way, all those pilots back then loved the flying scenes, but thought the overall war story was a bit Hollywood-- they were all combat vets so they knew from personal experience on both counts!",1236038400,,851,4.407643312101911
2021381,4,B0001NBMHQ,"Major Cleve Saville (Robert Mitchum) seems to have been made for war. Just as some men are good at sales or good at sports, he is good at killing. He has been hardened over the years over WWII and is a good commander. During the Korean War, he is assigned two young men to fly as his wingmen: Lt. Ed Pell (Robert Wagner) and Lt. Carl Abbott (Lee Philips). Pell is talkative and friendly while Abbott is a tremendously headstrong drunk. Unfortunately, Saville falls in love with Abbott's wife Kristina (May Britt). The two are suddenly conflicted and find it difficult to work together. Then tragedy strikes and the war becomes all the more personal.

Mitchum is a good man for the job in his masculine and somewhat mysterious role. Britt's acting is tremendously wooden; she seems more concerned with getting the words out than emoting. Thanks to Mitchum's professionalism, he is able to fudge the love scenes well enough, but this isn't a romance you're likely to remember. Wagner makes a good impression in a somewhat small role and Philips has several good scenes.

Director Dick Powell had a love for flying and it absolutely comes through in this film. If you're not interested in airplanes, you might get a little bored, but he keeps the visuals interesting enough to keep even the average citizen's interest.

There are some very violent scenes in this film, one in particular. It foreshadows the brutal war films that would be made decades later and makes a powerful statement about the Korean military.",1226361600,2,1511,4.803846153846154

The book does more character development but has a surreal ending being told by the pilot AFTER he is dead.  The F86's have correct markings, and using F84F's as Mig 15's was a good a choice as you could expect when this movie was made. They were similar in appearance although the F84F came after the Korean war was over. The movie has more action than the book, but alas, also had to have the required ""love plot"". Mitchum, a.k.a.

2021383,5,B0001NBMHQ,"Though I was not yet a teenager, I recall aspects of the Korean ""War"". Recall the A-Bomb drills we had in elementary school and the bomb shelters some people were building. But most of all I remember the F-86 Sabre jets, and though our capabilities were directly attributable to the work the Germans had done in WWII with jet aircraft, the swept wing F-86 was some piece of work. To see one today one must generally go to a museum or watch a movie such as THE HUNTERS. Just as the Grumman Panther can only be seen in a movie such as THE BRIDGES OF TOKI RI (another Korean era film) F-86s only come alive through the filming of THE HUNTERS.

I first saw this movie when it came out to movie theatres, and though I did not serve in the Air Force, it caused me by 1961 to serve in the military. We were a patriotic group back then, and many of us wanted to serve, with films such as this egging us on. Down through the years this particular film has remained one of my favorites and now with the DVD I can take it out to watch whenever.

If you enjoy ""war classics"" as they are now called, then this movie with its plot and subplots may bring you enjoyment. Even in my mid-60s it still remains for me quite a film. Much later I learned that James Salter, author of the book, THE HUNTERS, was a pilot who flew the F-86 in combat and the book is based on his experiences.  And as I say, the F86s of the movie are worth watching all in themselves.

Robert Mitchum is a great anchor to the story, but the corny almost-love affair with one of his fliers wives could have been left out. Robert Wagner is a young brash beat-nick pilot who grows up quick after being shot down and evading capture. the movie is fun, realistic, and has some good action in it.",1214697600,,550,4.8
2021385,5,B0001NBMHQ,"This 1958 film stars Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner as F-86 fighter pilots during the Korean War.  The air sequences are stunning and the photography is beautiful (the crisp blue skies are faithful to author James Salter's descriptions).  Excellent combat shots and low level high speed sequences, not seen in other films, including modern works where so much action is ""faked"".

The story is engaging enough, but in a typical '50's fashion, things are a bit too neat . . . whether war or extra-marital affairs.  Robert Mitchum is Robert Mitchum.  The young Robert Wagner turns in a good performance as a rather unlikeable know-it-all.  The unknown May Britt is an 8 on the 0-10 ""hot scale"".

A fun film, and probably a must for jet fighter buffs.  By the way, if you are a reader, do not let watching this film (even if the story disappoints you) discourage you from reading Salter's quasi-autobiographical novel, The Hunters.  Set in the same place and with generally the same characters, the story runs differently and the ending is COMPLETELY different.  The little known James Salter is arguably one of the best novelists of the 20th century.

Also, the maturing of a cocky young pilot (Wagner) was an important, tragic sub-plot.

2021392,5,B0001NBMHQ,"This movie has always been one of my favorite Korean War films. There were not too many Korean War films that depicted the air war in Korea: 'The McConnell Story'(an 'OK' movie), 'The Bridges at Toko-Ri'; (an EXCELLENT movie), 'Men of the Fighting Lady' (a VERY GOOD movie), 'Battle Hymn', and so on. Aside from the 'love triangle' between Major Saville (Robert Mitchum), Lt. Abbot (Lee Philips) and his wife Chris (May Britt), the story as an Air Force documentary is quite a bit off the mark, but still very entertaining.  First off, when Lt. Corona can't drop his external tanks before going into combat, he would have been ordered to return to base, with the 'extra' flyer used as a spare. Then, Lt. Pell (Robert Wagner) gets off on the wrong foot by not flying his wing position correctly (the pilot who couldn't drop his wing tanks) as he leaves his position as wingman of the element leader to 'encroach' another MiG that Saville had 'staked out'. After the mission, he would have been immediately grounded, no questions asked. The wingman's only job was to 'shadow' and 'protect' the element leader, or the 'shooter'.  The air combat scenes were superb- much like the fiasco movie 'Jet Pilot' produced and directed by Howard Hughes where he insisted that the sky and cloud formation had to be 'just right'.  Another 'glitch' in the movie;  after the first encounter with the MiG's, almost all of them exploded in a fireball.  Anybody who's familiar with air warfare history in Korea knows that MiG's very seldom exploded, but rather smoked badly before spinning out of control and crashing, but it was a good movie effect.  Also, it was interesting that the MiG's (actually Republic F-84F Thundrstreaks, a fighter-bomber) were painted that blue color.  From what I've read, most of the MiG's were in the original natural aluminum finish, with some 'honchos' having their crates painted in various 'personal' schemes, and as was discovered years later, were Soviet pilots assigned to Korea to help train Chinese and North Korean air crews. Also, aerial combat between the Sabre and the MiG was 'usually' at least hundreds, if not thousands of yards apart, unlike the movie where air to air combat was virtually, it seemed, only a handful of yards or less distant, let alone when Maj. Saville chased 'Casey Jones', the MiG pilot down to ground level.  The MiG's best performance was at high altitude- over 30,000 ft, and could not hold it's own against the Sabre at low altitudes.  The flying sequence between Saville and Lt. Col. Moncavage was interesting;  tail to tail at hundreds of MPH- sure could tell it was choreographed!  But superb 'flying for effect cinematography' none the less. The markings on the film's Sabre's were essentially correct; the checkered tail of the 51st Fighter Wing.  The yellow stripe on the tail indicated the Squadron (either red, blue or yellow). Also, Capt. Joseph McConnell's squadron had the yellow stripe, as in the movie, but he supposedly didn't get to Korea until 'after' the events in this movie took place.  Don't know for sure what 'models' of the Sabre were used in the  film, but most likely the 'F' version, as I caught a glimpse of the stenciling in one of the closeups that showed 'F86F-25-NA', the last version produced during the Korean War, that by the time of the movie had been relegated to ANG units or over-seas sales. In conclusion- sort of an early version of 'Top Gun'?  Certainly a Cold War '50's classic. Loved it back in 1957 as a teen-ager into building model kits! Loved the move years ago and still do, even with all it's warts! It's hard to believe that this flick is soon to be 50 years old, and some of those '86 Sabre's are STILL flying somewhere in the world!  What a 'crate'!",1189123200,3,3753,4.768518518518518

Robert Mitchum portrays the big hunter, the 'Iceman.' Maj. Cleve Saville was like death: no feelings, no nerves, no fear... In Japan, on his way to his first posting in Korea, he meets Lt. Carl Abbott (Lee Philips), a young pilot who thinks he is a bad flier... Too much booze was the sign... With 30 missions Abbott failed to get any enemy planes...

The romance between Mitchum and Mary Britt is less than compelling. Director Dick Powell would have been better served by a better actress. Sometimes when watching old movies, particularly from the 50s and 60s, one is simply astonished by the casting choices.

Robert Wagner's character, I have to admit, is so over the top that it actually works. His best line, delivered in a rapid, manic speed: ""I'm a killer, man, I cut 'em up, you know.""

2021403,4,B0001NBMHQ,"My DVD movie collection does not yet exceed 10 titles, but I had to have this film that I first saw decades ago. As it seldom showed up on TV it was not in my videotape collection.  The air combat sequences are as good or better than I remember but I thought there were more of them.  Other than Top Gun, this is the only film I can recall where the air combat sequences were obviously flown by US military pilots.  If more flying and interaction among the pilots had been substituted for the romantic subplot, I would have given it another star.  Fortunately as a DVD can be viewed chapter by chapter, the romatic junk can be skipped and viewers can cut right to the dogfights.  Actually I wish the flying sequences had been expanded.  The 2 seconds per kill clips of Wagner and Mitchum as they become double aces are analogous to the old baseball movies where a road trip is shown by pennants bearing the names of cities flying past a steam locomotive.  Perhaps the movie could have started (or flashed back to) WWII action involving Saville and Imil, when Saville was supposedly an immature hot shot like Pell.

The planes shown as MIG 15s are actually F-84F Thunderstreaks, manufactured by Republic Aviation.  I immediately noticed this discrepancy, as my father was a Republic engineer in the 1950s and designed components of the F-84F --cockpit air conditioning -- and also the Vietnam era F-105 Thunderchief -- hydraulics for the landing gear.  Our old 1951 Plymouth had an F-84F bumpersticker on it and later my heavy one-speed, foot-brake bike (the type with the wide center sections and the bell button) was plastered with F-105 stickers.  When I was 6 years old the Thunderbirds put on an airshow flying F-84Fs at the main Republic plant on Long Island where my father worked.  Using the Thunderstreak was probably the best option given the producers' obvious goal of showing real jet combat and in in no way detracts from the authenticity or exciitement of the flying sequences. As the film was made in 1958 at the height of the Cold War, I doubt there were sufficient MIGs available to film in air combat sequences in a movie made in the US.  In one scene, the film shows about 20 MIGs (i.e. F-84s) flying in an echelon. The F-84F was probably chosen because its intake has a vertical divider, as does the MIG-15, and it is also a swept wing plane.  I will watch most any film that emphasizes aviation or space (I bought The Right Stuff in the same order as this film).  Accordingly my rating is based to an extent on my personal interests.  Mitchum turns in an above-average performance in a role that is tailored to his tough guy with a human side personality (See e.g. Mitchum as General Norman Cota, deputy commander of the 29th infantry division--my father's unit--in The Longest Day) and Wagner is entertaining as a slang-spewing,  glory-seeking, neophyte, fighter jock who rubs Mitchum the wrong way as they compete to knock down enemy planes.  (Thanks to those of you who corrected my errors on the spelling and command position of Gen. Cota and the casting of the Star Trek episode).",1114905600,16,3105,4.66605504587156

My faded recollections of this Korean War flying epic long ago had melded into a vague and adolescent montage of childhood images of F-86 dogfights led by an aging Cleve Saville (Robert Mitchum), a cocksure would-be ace and young beatnik-like wingman, Lt. Ed Pell (Robert Wagner), the base commander (Richard Egan) who's memorable one-liner ""The Iceman Cometh!"" was enthusiastically uttered while observing Saville's aerial prowess through a pair of field binoculars, and of course an enemy ace named Casey Jones. When the movie stuck to flying, it was cutting edge and it was great. The aerial photography was fabulous. The F-86 Saber Jet was one classically beautiful and superb flying machine and its historic role helped define aerial combat in Korea. But alas, when the flying sequences deferred to a ridiculously improbable love triangle, ""The Hunters"" had a way of crashing and burning. Simple as that.",1090713600,47,1002,5.115853658536586
2021407,3,B0001NBMHQ,"THE HUNTERS is a good war movie saddled with a lame and unconvincing romantic subplot. Robert Mitchum plays Major Cleve Saville, a little long in the tooth fighter pilot newly arrived in Korea to lead a squadron of F-86 Sabre jets.  While stationed in Tokyo awaiting assignment he meets weak little 1st Lieut. Carl Abbott (Lee Philips) and his cute little wife Kris (May Britt), as well as slang spewing rookie pilot Lieut. Ed Pell (Robert Wagner.)
  As an action picture THE HUNTERS is incredibly entertaining, especially the filming of the jet dogfights.  Unfortunately, there's a rather substantial romantic subplot involving a sour little triangle whose points are Carl and Kris and Cleve.  Every romantic scene sucks the life right out of this movie.  May Britt may be beautiful but her ""affair"" with Saville borders on the melodramatic and is pretty unconvincing.  How often do you tell a married woman after your second platonic visit that you love her?  The only reason for the romance is to establish tension between Saville and wing man Abbott, anyway.
 Mitchum teamed with director Dick Powell a year earlier on THE ENEMY BELOW, one of the best WWII movies available.  With that movie in mind, it's doubly disappointing to see him fall back on cliched characters, like the cocky rookie Ed Pell, and a trite and time consuming love story.
 There's more to like than dislike in THE HUNTERS, but not nearly as much as I expected when I popped this dvd into the player. I liked this movie a bit less than I wanted to.  Make sure to play both sides of this double-sided disk, as there are a different set of `Special Features' on each side.",1090195200,32,1646,4.757042253521127
2021408,4,B0001NBMHQ,"""The Hunters"" is a well-made, exciting Korean war drama, with the accent on aviation. It has an above-average plot for this type of film, and the whole movie, particularly the aerial sequences, is expertly directed by Dick Powell. If you are interested in combat aircraft, there are many scenes of F-86 Sabre Jets engaging MIGs in dogfight battles to the death.
While the planes are great to watch, this film is primarily about human beings caught up in war. It stars Robert Mitchum, and he is terrific--his fighter pilot character is a born leader, yet he also suspects there is something important missing in his life. He enters into a guilt-ridden relationship with the wife of another pilot, played by lovely May Britt. When there's a war on though, the feelings of two people aren't worth--as someone once said--""a hill of beans"". Mr. Mitchum's main job is to lead a fighter squadron, and satisfy his boss on the ground--Richard Egan in a strong performance, knowing that every day he may be sending a man to his death.
Just to make things even more interesting for Mr. Mitchum, his squadron includes Ms. Britt's husband ( a paranoid, self-doubting Lee Philips ) and a cocky, young ""hotshot"" who doesn't like ""rules"" ( a young, excellent Robert Wagner ). It would be unfair to reveal more of the plot, but the film is consistently interesting and exciting.
The DVD is full screen on one side, and wide-screen on the other. The colour is very good for a 46-year old film. It does not have ""surround sound"", of course, unlike that 1986 aviation hit, ""Top Gun""--then again, ""Top Gun"" didn't have Robert Mitchum !
