8375304,1,B002NPY7G8,Horrible. I only watched about 30 min before I shut it off.,1408406400,,59,4.0
8375305,2,B002NPY7G8,"You can try to like this but it unfortunately has more holes than swiss cheese... looks like a ambitious filmstudent tries to make a body-modification horror-movie on a junkyard... reminds me a little of 'Skinned alive' or something like 'Abducted' in tone and setting... but it sure is no winner. Strangely enough, the german edition I watched is titled 'Machined', which I found out is this sleeping-pill's predecessor?? Strange world, indeed. For this movie: skip it...it's just not good.",1392940800,,491,5.227848101265823
8375306,3,B002NPY7G8,"I was hoping the sequel would be at least as good as Machined, but I was disappointed. While the technical aspects were slightly better than the first film, the plot was a hot mess. I think the actors did great, but the lousy script really held them back. I have no idea how this became a Lionsgate film.",1322524800,,304,4.258620689655173
8375307,1,B002NPY7G8,"I think this is a sequel to Machined ..or is it?  Simply awful torture porn thats just plain boring. The acting is abysmal.  The lead is especially atrocious.  Imagine Saw if it was shot by a 4 year-old, thats Reborn. Please give me that 90 minutes back! 0 stars",1280620800,,262,4.3061224489795915
8375308,2,B002NPY7G8,"After a somewhat creepy and promising start, Reborn quickly hurls itself into a veritable Grand Canyon of stupidity.  Twenty five minutes in, I was already checking to see how much time was left in this torturously bad cinematic experience.  The basic storyline had potential, albeit that of just another clich&eacute;d and stereotypical slasher, but Craig McMahon (who wrote, filmed, edited, produced, and directed this bloody mess) tries so hard to push the envelope of gore and torture that he just sidesteps some of the basic tenets of moviemaking.  For instance, I never cared one iota about any of the characters on display here.  Things happened way too fast early on to permit me to bond in any real way with the primary victim, and I just couldn't buy the emotional undercurrents that I assume are meant to exist between her and the man doing all of the killing (it's really hard to sympathize with someone as stupid as this guy).  A good filmmaker also doesn't throw things at the audience just for the heck of it or rely on a little blood and gore to offset a plot full of nonsense.

I think divorce should be granted immediately if your husband quits his job, sells your residence, takes you out in to the middle of the desert and informs you that an incredibly run-down junkyard is your new home.  Apparently, Gabe's wife really, really loves him because she agrees to give Gabe the benefit of the doubt.  Little does this newlywed couple know, though, that the place they now call home was recently the site of a number of hideous and sadistic murders (although, as stupid as Gabe appears to be, he would probably have bought the place anyway).  Not surprisingly, things start out bad and get a lot worse in quite a hurry.  As we soon learn, the infamous Motorman Dan hasn't gone anywhere and is still in the business of recruiting someone to kill indiscriminately for him.  I won't go into the details of how Motorman Dan makes things happen, but trust me when I say that he is alone in actually enjoying the sadistic murder spree that makes up the bulk of this movie.

After watching this film, I discovered that it is actually a sequel to a 2006 Craig McMahon production called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Machined/dp/B000FUF6TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Machined</a>.  Not only do you not need to watch the first film in order to, ahem, ""enjoy"" Reborn, I would go so far as to suggest you avoid that film - and this one - altogether.  From what I understand, the first movie is even worse than this one.  Unless you crave utter nonsense, I don't see how you could possibly enjoy watching this movie.",1278979200,,2665,4.852097130242826
8375309,3,B002NPY7G8,"An engineer quits his job, rents his home and buys a junkyard in the desert without consulting his wife. Then to top it all off he plans to be a mechanic, after all how hard can that be for an engineer to be a mechanic...in the desert.(Let me know how that works out).

Once you get by that, his wife, Davina Joy sports a fairly nice rack, which she is very proud of in the movie for those who require some nudity. They are worth the price of admission. The wife is eventually taken prisoner by sicko, Motorman Dan. The husband sees his wife tied to a torture chair and is forced to kill people who stop by in order to keep her alive. The husband ends up in a silly metal costume to perform the deeds.

Motorman Dan has a ""Saw"" quality to him. In the movie extras we find out that while rehearsing for the movie, Motorman Dan sneezed and did a twitch which seemed to worked pretty well. So in the movie, Dan has got a nervous twitch that adds to the psycho effect.",1278633600,3,964,4.149732620320855
8375310,1,B002NPY7G8,"This movie really stinks.  Everything about it--the script, the acting, the direction---everything.  It's boring, sadistic and makes no sense whatsoever.  Why does Cade go crazy?  What's with the ghosts?  The earthquakes?  What's this Motorman nonsense?  Avoid at all costs.",1260316800,5,274,5.871794871794871
8375311,5,B002NPY7G8,"Jimmy Flowers is great in this movie! He does an amazing job, when I first saw this I was like ""oh my god!"" You should definatly chec it out if your into hot guys and horror movies!",1260230400,3,181,3.918918918918919
8375312,5,B002NPY7G8,"From filmmaker Craig McMahon (The Crypt, Machined and Sportkill.) The movie follows a couple that buys a junk yard on the same property where the Motor-man murders took place. Not a big fan of McMahon's early work but was very surprised when he came out with the Crypt and shortly there after Reborn. There are scenes that caught me off guard. I will say horror has been unimpressive over the past years with the overused, same styles. But McMahon is certainly a breath of fresh air for the genre. It didn't dawn on me until I watched the end credits roll to realize he literally made these movies himself with the help of an assistant. There was no long credit list of people that usually follow films, just him and one other person. So I take my hat off to this guy and will go on record that McMahon is a director of tomorrow.",1257206400,3,829,4.3896103896103895
