2195596,5,B0006U5UT0,"This DVD was a great buy. I am a soldier currently stationed in Italy. When I get family visiting me I let them watch this DVD to get their "" mouths wet"" so to speak. This is a great intriduction to Italy.",1116892800,5,205,3.9047619047619047
2195597,5,B0006U5UT0,"I first saw Visions of Italy Southern Style on PBS about a year and a half ago.  Ever since, I have been trying to get the tapes.  When I saw that all 3 DVDs were packaged together, I ordered right away.  Not only was I amazed by the way the DVD was put together, but, the views of Italy by helicopter were breath-taking!  I went to Italy last summer, and when I watch these DVDs, it is like I'm back there again.  I love these DVDs and if you are thinking of going to Italy sometime, these DVDs will make you want to pack your bags today!  I know that I can't wait to see these beautiful ""Visions"" for myself again soon.",1116806400,11,621,4.049180327868853
2195598,5,B0006U5UT0,"This DVD set is superb.  The video and sound quality is excellent. It's much better than it looks on PBS.  The pannoramic views are stunning, the narrator enchanting and the music is really nice.  If you enjoyed this on PBS, then you will love this DVD set.  If you've never seen this on PBS, but have been to Italy, you will reminisce at the places, monuments, etc. this DVD adventure takes you on. I highly recommend this.",1111104000,66,424,4.467532467532467
2195599,5,B0006U5UT0,"This DVD box set captures the essence and beauty of Italia.  The heart stopping scenery and panoramic views are enough to send shivers down one's spine.  Apart from being a well informative documentary, it can also serve as a reference for travellers or simply watch it to relax.",1110931200,13,279,4.791666666666667
2195600,4,B0006U5UT0,"This aerial video footage of Italy was shot in HD and transfered to this DVD in widescreen anamorphic format. The DVD video quality is very good (unfortunately not excellent) with fine color and good detail overall. Contrary to the statement of the previous reviewer, this DVD is indeed in widescreen format. HD source material is by nature widescreen. The audio is in Dolby Digital 2.0 and the soundtrack is well recorded.
I saw some of this series on PBS in HD when it was first broadcast and WOW was it beautiful. Unfortunately I later bought the VHS version of the shows as the DVD version was at that time a $100 plus special purchase. Of course, I was disappointed in the VHS quality but had litle recourse. Now with the release of this reasonably priced set of DVD's I'm again enjoying this wonderful video of Italy, maybe not in HD but much better than my old video tapes. Recommended to all lovers of Italy.",1109376000,128,916,4.591463414634147
2195601,3,B0006U5UT0,"Although the package is clearly marked as Widescreen 16:9, this beautiful aerial presentation of Italy is Not Widescreen. It fills the screen, top to bottom. It appears to have been copied from a widescreen version as the scenes are distorted. The distortion is most noticeable when people or animals are shown and they look unnaturally tall as the view is stretched to fill the screen. Were it not for the techinal production problems, this set would certainly rate a 5.  If you enjoyed the PBS presentation, you will enjoy the additional bonus footage included.",1109289600,13,563,4.98936170212766

2195613,4,B0006U5UT0,"I had previously purchased this on DVD and absolutely love it so wanted to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  I have not finished watching the entire show in the Blu-Ray format, but from what I have seen so far it is higher quality than the previously released DVD version. Not sure that the blu-ray quality is as good as other blu-rays I have seen though. If you do not already own Visions of Italy then you definitely need to add this to your collection. But, if you already own it on DVD I don't know if it's worth the almost $30 to upgrade to Blu-Ray.",1427328000,2,541,4.252427184466019

2195616,5,B0006U5UT0,"In my opinion the best in the series. Being blu-ray the pic quality is about an eight, out of ten. Fantastic photography. Really shows the beauty of Italy.  But.... The sultry narrative of Franca Barchiesi on the first disc kind of lull's you to sleep. I had to re-watch the disc several times, to catch up on what I missed, from dosing off. Not that the material is in anyway boring, because it is not. But the music, and her peaceful voice just did a number on me. No problem with the second disc ""Sicily, and the great cities"" A guy narrates. If you've been to Italy, as I have, you'll want to go back after watching. If you've never been...This will inspire you to.",1422835200,2,669,4.352

All you need to do is load this CD, and watch it!",1392336000,,349,4.0
2195635,5,B0006U5UT0,The entire video gives you the feeling of soaring over Italy and her beautiful landscape. Fantastic footage and I only wish I could have been there when they shot this.  Wonderful gift for anyone who is going or has gone to Italy.,1389225600,,230,4.476190476190476
2195636,4,B0006U5UT0,"Terrific country, a little smoggy in the north ruining a little the views.  A little sentimental on the commentary side, you can just have the music if you like.

2195637,5,B0006U5UT0,"I originally saw Visions of Italy, Southern Style several years ago on a PBS broadcast.  I recorded it and watched it many times.  The scenery, music and narration are magical.  However, it was in standard video.  Now that I own the Blu-ray version I am even more thrilled.  The images seem to jump off the screen with brilliance and clarity.  And the other four areas of Italy that are included in the set make this a timeless value.",1386460800,,434,4.5
2195638,5,B0006U5UT0,"Everyone who watches this cannot get enough of it. The only thing I did not like was I felt deceived when I ordered it because it was advertised at a very low price to get me locked into an automatic deal where I was required to keep ordering a minimum amount per years, and my credit card was automatically charged each month regardless, and I  wanted only this one item. When I discovered what happened, I had to call and ask them to remove my name from the automatic mailing, etc. They complied, but it should have been very clear  in the ad, and it was not. I felt tricked, and I don't like that. These things should not be hidden is very small print where hardly anyone sees it. The item is good enought to sell itself without creative and deceptive marketing. Other companies do the same thing, so look out!",1382918400,2,813,4.342105263157895

2195640,2,B0006U5UT0,"Helicopter views are beautiful, however, as much as I would love to see the facades of the medieval buildings, the spray of the fountains in the piazzas, ornamentation and sculptures, the DVD does not show any details below the roof lines. Although I feel I now know every roof in Italy and plans of all the major tourist cities and towns, I still don't know much about the history of these towns, I don't know who built the roofs, I don't know about the life under these roofs. People are reduced to dots on various piazzas. A market stands' awnings are shown, but no interaction between the vendors and the buyers. With no human interaction, no street life, not one human face, the DVD seems visually beautiful but lifeless.

The commentary is sparse; long vistas, sweeps of the countryside, bird's eye views of old piazzas are shown without any narration, and when there is a commentary it is short and a mere whisper drowned out by otherwise beautiful music. I needed to strain to catch a few words.

Despite the beautiful aerials, the DVD lacks a human touch, audible commentary and information.",1381363200,,1100,4.723958333333333

2195645,5,B0006U5UT0,Wow the video is well done!  Makes one want to board a plane now and head to Italy.  I think this video would be very helpful on helping decide places to visit if traveling to Italy.,1375747200,,182,4.027777777777778
2195646,5,B0006U5UT0,"I would recommend this Blue Ray disc to anyone who wants to get a quick birds view of the most important cities and towns of Italy.
It's like taking a flight on a magic carpet that will transport you through breathtaking landscapes of Italy.
It will make you wanna book a flight on your next vacation.
Great high definition images.
The only downside , if any is that the narrators voice is recorded at very low volume.",1375228800,,418,4.441558441558442

2195649,5,B0006U5UT0,"Not normally a person that purchases videos like this, I saw it on TV, on a Sunday the day I moved and we had no cable yet.  I was utterly amazed at the quality of this video and the thorough tour you get, arial as well.  I've never seen Italy portrayed in such a manner.  Its beautiful relaxing and leaves you wanting to book a tour through Italy immediately.  I bought this copy for a friend's birthday who had a fit over it as well.

Having recently visited Genoa, Florence and the northern coast we found this to be the perfect complement to our still photos.  This version had nicely balanced music and narration volume and the images were absolutely amazing.

Although I applaud the effort of the film crew for the time spent and quality of aerial photography I didn't like this perspective of Italy.  I found the video to be monotonous.  The descriptions were very plain and lacked interesting detail.  I fell asleep a few times during the view.

I agree with one other reviewer.  Italy is best seen up close and not totally from a helicopter.  I don't think I'll watch this again.",1358294400,,592,4.27027027027027

I was disappointed that some knucklehead took it upon himself to alter any part of this fine program.  Do they think they made it better?  That no one would notice?  It's all over television, and anyone and everyone who has seen the original will be disappointed.

On a few close-ups of the piazzas, I can read the names of shops I used to visit. One surprising element was how it showed many places I have never been to or heard of, but now plan of visiting when I return (Isola dei Pescatori for one). The narration and music are beautiful, but sometimes I turn on the ""Music Only"" feature and let it play while I'm doing other tasks. Io lo raccomando a tutti!",1309478400,,532,4.2254901960784315

2195715,5,B0006U5UT0,"I was up late one night and happened to catch the last 15 minutes of this feature on PBS. I was so mesmerized by the extraordinarily beautiful scenery and aerial views that I went and bought the DVDs last month. The sweeping panoramic views of the landscapes captured were so breathtaking! The coastal towns perched perfectly on cliffs facing Italy's beautiful blue seas are just magnificent and you'll wish you were actually there. The small quaint towns and villages tucked deep within vibrant green valley's are nestled comfortably between glorious mountain ranges. Every image is just immaculate; the plant life and trees are these stunningly vibrant hues and all of Italy looks like it is a part of some kind of heavenly Utopia.

Along with the aerials you are given historical and architectural details about the structures and citizens of each town and city. It's like having your own personal tour guide. I thought Franca Barchiesi narration accentuated the program perfectly. She was the verbal equivalent of the visuals: seductive, serene, almost enchanting and authentically Italian.

I cannot justifiably put into words the beauty of Italy that was captured on these DVDs you will have to see for yourself. If you enjoy learning about other cultures and locations then buy these DVDs and you will not be disappointed!",1273449600,2,1329,5.091743119266055

It was terrific to go back via this video and experience some fantastic memories that make me want to pack up and return immediately. And the narrator, well, her voice was unbelievable. Such a sexy accent!

Contrarily, there was no footage/discussion of Milano where I lived! I was surprised to see that as it is such an important city in Italy. There are incredible places that could have been included: the Duomo, La Scala, Cimetero Monumentale, San Siro, Parco Sempione, La Galeria Vittorio Emanuele II, Montenapoleone, Porta Genova, Santa Maria delle Grazie with Il Cenacolo (the Last Supper), Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio, Naviglio Grande, and the list goes on.",1268352000,3,784,4.894736842105263
2195721,5,B0006U5UT0,"Watched this last night, and I was very impressed with the quality of the video. I believe it's 1080i, and it looked really good. I have many BluRay on Italy, and this is by a good measure the best from a photographic standpoint. All of the footage is taken from helicoptors in the air, so there are no inside views of any landmarks or attractions. But the from-the-sky perspective is one I've not seen before and really gives another perspective of Italy. Combined with the high quality of the video, and it's very rewarding to watch.

There are 2 BR disks in the set, and unfortunately there is a bit of overlap in the footage between them. Some of the Florence, Rome and Capri footage is common, as are a few other snippets (altho' the narration is completely different between the two). But most of it is unique to each disk. The narrator is different on each disk. The woman on the one disk is a bit hard to understand sometimes, but both do an excellent job at talking about interesting facts and perspectives on the material.

The camera operators do an excellent job finding interesting things to augment the views, and of panning to keep interesting landmarks in view as the helicoptors are flying around. It's actually almost stomach turning in a few point, so if you get seasick easily you might find it a bit interesting. Not enough not to buy, just in a couple of places. They will find kites on the beach, or other interesting activities, to add to the already interesting scenes, so it's not just a picture of something interesting, but also an activity that makes it more interesting at times. In most of the views they are flying low, so you really get a close perspective on the sights from the air. Combine that with the high resolution video, and you really get to see a lot. The stabilized video platforms they used are good, and all of the video is rock smooth.

I have been to Italy a number of times, and this video provided many things that I want to go back and see and photograph that I had missed on earlier trips.

I don't think this would be the best choice as the only overview of Italy if you are looking for what to do on the ground, but either to augment, or as a beautiful overview, or just for the beaty of it, it simply can't be beat. Lots of content, too.

The camera work is outstanding, the colors are vibrant, and should be in every Blu ray owner's library.  However, out of the several hundred minutes of flying over one red-tiled town after another, it does get very repetitive.  I was bored for too long.  Sometimes a shot over a town would be so fantastic, you'd want the helicopter to just land already and show us the streets!  Alas, they'd glaze over it, on to the next town.

Quite often when the heliocopter would rapidly ascend while turning, a wave of nausea would linger.  Place names intended to appear across the corner of the screen were out of the viewing area.  Palermo, as an example, would only allow Pale to be seen while the narrator was mute.  This was a constant.  The narrator, I felt, was the worst choice made in the production and the wonderful music just about drowned her out because it was too loud over her voice....which means you really needed to crank up the volume so that your neighbors could enjoy the music while you listened intently to try and hear what she was talking about.

This is all true. Unfortunately, that's all you see.
I like travel videos so I can be on the ground and seeing the sights from ground level.
Not from the cruising altitude of a helicopter!!!

I was very disappointed in these videos because you don't get to see anything from
ground level. Everything is from up in the air. And while the scenery might be nice,
the producers are totally missing the boat on this one.

I disliked these videos and wouldn't even want them if they were given to me
at no cost. So you can guess how likely it is that I'd buy them.
I was lucky in that I saw them as a rental, I'd have been totally peeved if I'd
bought them.

I'm giving it two stars for the overall scenery. But frankly, its lucky to get
one star otherwise.

I just keep it running every time I have people over for dinner (I'm from Italy - Florence specifically) to have a 100% Italian experience! All my friends have loved it and often move from the table (after they're done eating.. of course!) to the couch to see the images better.

I have given this DVD set to several clients of mine who have traveled to Italy with me, they all love it. The images in this DVD are really what count, as it's not really a documentary with a travel guide telling you about each place.",1185062400,,1226,4.429203539823009

I love Italy and her kind people. Visions of Itlay brings me back to the wonderful places we visited and makes me yearn to return as soon as I can.

The photography is wonderful, the music so Italian, and the narration is very nice. You almost feel you are there.

A delight from start to finish.",1182902400,,361,4.202898550724638

2195791,4,B0006U5UT0,"Seeing this video which was photographed from a helicopter makes me want not only to tour Italy, but also to rent a helicopter and see everything as it was shown in this video. What a beautiful, scenic view of Italy. The music and narration were lovely and soothing. It's not only a great watch, but probably lowers one's blood pressure significantly.

2195806,4,B0006U5UT0,"The photography is great. I have but one complaint. The producers of these things need to understand that the background music should not drown out the narration.  It is very difficult to hear the narration with clarity, and afterall, that's what you need to hear to understand where you are.",1173312000,6,292,4.84

The scenery is so breathtaking that it makes you want to cry!

This is spectacular, one-of-a-kind video that you will never

see from the ground. I had no idea Italy had such incredible scenery,

AND mountains! We can watch this over and over again and never tire of it.

My only question is, when will there be a Visions of Ireland??",1172016000,9,394,4.571428571428571

2195812,5,B0006U5UT0,"I bought this DVD set to use at an elementary school's Multicultural Festival where I ran the Italian booth.  I had the DVD's playing and they attracted a lot of attention.  Italy is a stunningly beautiful country, and these DVD's provide a beautiful introduction to what's there.  Wonderful images and great music.  Mostly shot from a helicopter, so you have all these GRAND VISTAS!  I'd recommend this if you are planning a trip to Italy and don't yet know where you want to go!  This might pique your interest into planning a trip to certain places.",1167868800,5,552,4.697916666666667

Beautiful moving pictures of all of Italy with very little verbal talk while using a nice seductive background music. A feast for both the eyes and ears. Was just as enjoyable as during my past visits.",1151452800,8,362,4.73015873015873

2195816,5,B0006U5UT0,"Northern style, Southern style, Sicily - these are magnificent DVDs! Nothing's lost by not being at street level wandering through each town, and real richness is afforded by the incredible vantage point. The approach is immediate, pristine and measured. Even as the HD camera sweeps patiently across land and sea, you find yourself down in the heart of a particular town, then you move on. The adventure purrs along! A favorite moment comes the early part of the Southern Style film, the camera moves across the waters of a bay and Connie Francis sings Ritorna a me. It's a moment ripe with memories of Italy - and an hypnotic mind bender! Some reviewers have said narrator Franca Barchiesi's voice is too soft. I'd say seductive rather than soft, and it's good she underplays the narration, because watching Visions begets a listening mind, and the rewards increase in proportion. The music selections are crucial, and handled with care. Beyond the visuals, Visions makes great music for working at the computer. PBS plays these gems nearly every pledge, and I watch them every time they show; now I don't have to wait. For sheer thrill, you cant go wrong with this set. The Sicily video is less interesting, a male narrator seems to read without much engagement, but the visuals are fine, especially the lingering over churches.",1143072000,63,1331,4.92
2195817,4,B0006U5UT0,"This is undoubtedly some of the most stunning views of Italy you will ever see.  We can't say enough about the creativity regarding shot selection and visual composition.  Having said this, we are preparing for a trip to Italy and would have liked to see more than just aerial shots.  But we should have read the description more carefully in advance--if so, we would have known these limitations.  If one is interested in just stunning views of Italy, then this really is a 5-star DVD!",1142726400,19,486,4.682352941176471

homesick for Italy we watch Visions of Italy.  The scenery from the sky is excellent. The DVD covers both Northern and Southern Italy and is very well done.

2195824,5,B0006U5UT0,I actually bought it for my friend that came from Italy.  He had seen bits & pieces of the video on cable TV and wanted to see the entire video.  Breathtaking scenes of Italy including his town he grew up in.  It realistically takes you back to the lovliness of Italy.  I am anxious to visit Italy now.,1124496000,5,302,4.155172413793103
2195825,4,B0006U5UT0,"I purchased this DVD in anticipation of trip to Italy.  If you have never been to Italy or don't have a trip planned, this collection will provide the inspiration to visit.

Most segments include a narrative describing the history, culture, and geography of the region. Having said that, Visions of Italy is more of a pictoral essay versus a guide to the region. The images and narration are set to tasteful music, modern and classical.

Disc 1, Pt. 1 (Northern Sytle)
The first covers regions north of Rome. This includes the larger cities of Florence and Venice, plus smaller towns like Genoa, Stresa, Portofino, and Siena. This segment also provides beautiful images from Lake Como and the Carrara Quarries.

Disc 1, Pt. 2 (Southern Style)
The segment covers Rome and regions to the south of the mainland.  In addition to showing beautiful shots from Naples, Sorrento, and Rome, there are views of the Amalfi Coast and Mt. Vesuvius and several smaller towns.

Disc 1, Pt. 3
This is a bonus segment of images not included in the main narrative.

Disc 2, Pt. 1 (Sicily)
The second disc covers the island of Sicily, including Palermo and smaller towns like Messina and Cefalu. After growing accustomed to the narrator on the first disc, it was a mistake to watch this one immediately after.  The narrator is very good, just different from the one used on the previous disc.

Disc 2, Pt. 2
Bonus material not covered in Disc 2, Pt. 1.

The four star rating is really meant to be 4.5 stars. I think the same narrator should have been used for both DVDs and the division of the country seems somewhat arbitrary. Why devote generous time to Sicily without providing any images from Italy's second largest city (Milan)?  At the very least, Milan's Duomo and La Scala could have been included in the bonus footage.  These are minor complaints, it is a beautiful DVD to watch.  Well worth the money.",1124323200,29,1892,4.714285714285714
