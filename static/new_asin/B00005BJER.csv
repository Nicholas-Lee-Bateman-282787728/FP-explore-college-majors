7937635,1,B00005BJER,"The video quality of this disk is very poor. You could shoot better quality video with a consumer grade video camera. Also, less than half the film is devoted to scenic footage of Yosemite. The remainder is documentary footage, including poorly acted histroical recreations.",1102550400,9,274,5.25
7937636,2,B00005BJER,This DVD might be interesting to those wishing to visit Yosemite one day and o some decent help in touring the park but THE PICTURE QUALITY STINKS and is very outdated. Those that want information on the park then this dvd is very informative. But those that want good picture quality then look elsewhere. It's a shame because alot of the filiming and shots very very good but the picture was faded and old looking. If you want to buy it then buy it on VHS and save the money. This one was not of any digital DVD standard. Alot of menus and chapters to go through but that's it. Picture never improves. Looks like a 60's video.,1059436800,10,627,4.322033898305085
