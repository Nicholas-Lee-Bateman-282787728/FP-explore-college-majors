8473014,5,B005HIBWF2,"Once again MGM made to order have hit the mark. This 1960 Silvermine prod of 1960 released originally by UA is now released in an excellent B/W 4.3 ratio print with great sound. The plot is a bit of a variation on the usual shenanigans, and features  a great, unusual performence from Walter Coy, here seen as a truly sadistic villain, and he really seems to enjoy the opportunity to show what he can do. Other western notables also do well - Willis Bouchey/Greg Palmer/Robert Karnes/Boyd Morgan, and of course, that great totem pole, James Brown, an unsung western hero in my opinion. The direction by Cahn moves at a good pace, and my only reservations are John Wilder who doesn't really convince as the (then almost) obligatory angry young man, and Della Sharman who again doesn't really convince me as a frontier woman. Small quibbles and purely personal. Highly recomended for western fans. (But please, MGM, bring the price down!!)",1335398400,3,937,4.819875776397516
