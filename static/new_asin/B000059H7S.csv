7933276,5,B000059H7S,"This is another of Shane McConkey's great films. His loss is still mourned for a lot of his fans/us .I enjoyed There's something about McConkey very much. I am starting to look for all the films he was a part of. He is one of the worlds best skiers and brought to us the Fat Ski for deep powder skiing. If you love snow and the skiing . Then you will love this movie. Check out his other film ""McConkey""",1447977600,,403,4.05
7933277,5,B000059H7S,I was wary of the cost of this product because all the other ones are over $60 but it came intact and is the exact DVD I was expecting.  Hilarious footing of the legendary Shane McConkey!,1430352000,,187,4.194444444444445

7933280,5,B000059H7S,"Those that were disappointed that this wasn't 100% sick skiing footage need to take a chill pill, or get a sense of humour. Just the cover pic lets you know this is goofy movie so why take it so seriously.

The skiing footage is insane, but how much heli footage can you take? That's why they break it up with Saucer Boy and all of the innovative ways they incorporated the sponsors. How can you expect a serious movie about McConkey if you know anything about him?

I've watched this dozens of times, and still am amazed at the skiing, and still laugh my ass off every time.",1110844800,2,575,4.314814814814815
7933281,5,B000059H7S,"needs to see this film.  It's probably the most balanced appraisal of how this administration has misled the public, played with our economic future, and created the great divide between the ever-richer (the haves and the have mores, as W says) and the newly-poor.",1094688000,14,264,5.0
7933282,4,B000059H7S,"Too funny for words - our kids love it, and the White Rap is worth the price alone!
Oh yeah, the boy can ski too....",1073347200,,116,3.68
7933283,2,B000059H7S,"I purchased the vid given the hipe and because McConkey is an awesome skier.  Having watched this back to back with some of other ski flicks... my impression was that the film was not of the same standard (skiing or filming).
The thing that bothered me, and everyone of the adults (expert skiers) in the crowd was the immature non-skiing footage. It really detracted from what could have been an entertaining movie.",1042416000,2,415,4.763888888888889
7933284,5,B000059H7S,"Most other ski movies just have music and skiing.  That's great, but this movie has far more.  As the name suggests, it highlights Shane McConkey's impact on the present movement/revolution in skiing (and BASE jumping), but it doesn't fail to leave out other players like Mosley, Morrison, Davenport, and others.  This movie doesn't just make you think, ""That trick was sick."" It will also make you laugh until you can't breathe.  At the risk of sounding trite I will say this movie is motivating.  When I don't really feel like making the drive up skiing, I pop in the DVD and I can't wait to go by five minutes into the video.  Even if you don't like skiing that much, you will still love this movie.  It will make you want to ski.",985392000,10,733,4.466165413533835
7933285,5,B000059H7S,"Recently on a skydiving trip I had the opportunity to view an advance copy of ""There's Something About Mcconkey.""  To my surprise what I expected to be more of a favor to my friend than entertainment turned out to be one of the best ski movies that I have ever seen.  Mcconkey's wry sense of humor combined with his ability to take the sport of skiing to its outermost edge left my heart pounding with exhileration and my eyes filled with tears of laughter.",983145600,4,457,4.428571428571429
