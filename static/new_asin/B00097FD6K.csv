This is not a scientific exposition of celestial mechanics, but a nuts and bolts approach of how to use a sextant and how to calculate a position fix using the sun. Star fixes are not part of the instructions but the theory for star triangulation is basically the same as for the sun. This is a good instructional backup to have in case the electronics on the boat fail.",1427932800,,450,4.567901234567901

No one has put togeather a better learning sorce. A must have. He makes learning Celestial Navigation fast and easy. NOT BORRING. like the other favorite DVD on this subject. If you can only have one learning sorce this is the one to get. Worth every penny and then some.",1221609600,14,420,4.6891891891891895
