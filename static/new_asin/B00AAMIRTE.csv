5406336,5,B00AAMIRTE,Highly intelligent and inspirational film.,1409788800,,42,7.6
5406337,5,B00AAMIRTE,I enjoyed this movie. It has a lot of information that it goes through rapidly. Information that unfortunately is a bit old but is unfortunately not taught and known by many Americans. I suggest this movie wholeheartedly.,1362009600,4,221,5.0
5406338,3,B00AAMIRTE,"Looks very interesting but... No subtitles in english for the hearing impaired.
No subtitles in any other languaje for non english speaking people.",1361145600,2,147,5.434782608695652
5406339,2,B00AAMIRTE,"At first when I started to watch, I thought it was really interesting, however, as soon as it got to the part of ""Law"" it lost me. It dove into how humanity is owned by ""laws"", okay whatever. What I will say to this movie is it had potential to be thoughtful and inspiring, yet it went down the path of negative conspiracy theories. There is a lot to think about in this movie, and it all has to do with perspective. This movie chose the dark, dim perspective, and it lost me.",1477699200,6,476,4.129032258064516
5406340,5,B00AAMIRTE,"Wow, intense! Quite a roller coaster ride. Not easy to watch as the information challenges everything one might believe to be true. The animal treatment scenes where especially difficult for me. Happily it does end on a more positive and action oriented note. Quite worth the time for anyone who has a desire to consider that things may not be as they seem. Very glad I watched it, much to consider. Well done!",1473120000,6,410,4.63013698630137
5406341,4,B00AAMIRTE,"Horrible, nightmarish. I get it, we take responsibility for ourselves and our actions. We belong to us and no other. What this film suggests seems to be revolutionary and I applaud the people that made it, but I cannot see innocents be tormented. I know it happens, I don't do it myself, I eat meat though rarely, still I try to get humanely gained meat. Once the horrible pictures started, I was out. sorry.",1473120000,4,408,4.527027027027027
5406342,5,B00AAMIRTE,Ties everything together!,1471824000,,25,7.666666666666667
5406343,3,B00AAMIRTE,"It's okay if you want to think of new ways of looking at things. But it is quite difficult to follow because of glaring bright lights, the narration's background music, opinions presented quickly as though they're always correct, where blame could be placed, etc.",1470700800,8,263,5.0
5406344,1,B00AAMIRTE,"Kymatica makes a claim I disagree strongly with.  That it's your fault.  That if you change yourself you'll change the world because you are the world, somehow.

It's actually not true.  It's good 'for you' to change yourself in positive ways.  I can get behind that.  But no, you are not living in the truman show in a solipsistic existence.  You are however in your own wilsonian 'reality tunnel' meaning solipsism 'to you' but when you interact with others, you 'collapse the waveform' of possibility in juxtaposition and fixate consensus reality in that moment; meaning that basically you have free will.

If you have free will, so do others; which means there are people asserting their will on the world and it affects you in a real way.  If you study history, and by that I don't mean the garbage taught in public school but the perspective that reveals the government (specifically the cia) as an entirely self-serving 'individual' that has committed a litany of war crimes, then you realize very quickly that ""YOU are the problem"" is totally, completely  FALSE.

It turns out, YOU never gassed anyone with sarin.  YOU didn't kill 4M-7M muslims in the last 15 yrs i(although you didn't stop it, unless you had the integrity to protest it and vote against it).  I'm sorry this review is political but dammt you guys need to wake up, like for real.

I saw this on gaiam and unlike others here I am a bit insulted by the naivety of accusing people of 'being the cause of all the problems in the world'.  This is a childish and unlearned viewpoint that stems from this gnostic perspective peddling by people in the new age domain (ie: gaiam) who are attempting to foist this perspective on people as a means of political control.  Specifically, the peddling of coincidentarianism versus conspiracism.  The idea that there's no cadre of anti-national corporatists (ie globalists) that are controlling everything we see and hear as curated material with an intention intention and will to create and sustain an underclass that is working on their behalf so that aristocrats can enjoy the fruits of everyone elses labor, and doing so by mind-controlling people into giving their power away to icons, giving their thoughts away to body-sensation and fashion tropes leading to hyperconsumerism and tabula rasa mind; giving their souls to false religions; giving their relationship to the truth to the trixters who gaslight them and inhibit them from knowing their true history; and giving up their humanity by giving consent to permanent war, despite the deep-seated hypocrisy of simultaneously being a so-called 'christian'.

So while it's true what Kymatica says that the problem with this world today is with you, it's also with 'them' the neocon global fascists at the top.  It's an abusive relationship on a massive scale and if you don't see it, then it's good you have a gaim subscription because there's a lot more content you can consume and consume and consume until you burst into a puddle of oblivion that would be the final ""unity"" of the great unknown...and by that unknown I mean you literally won't know anything about the truth.

Gaim content is fun, and sometimes inspiration but you have to take it with a mine of salt",1469491200,8,3236,4.859744990892532
5406345,3,B00AAMIRTE,Started out really interesting but towards the end the movie goes into really awful shock value imagery of innocent animals being tortured and it is so horrible I had to turn it off. Total negativity at the end of something that had the potential to be somewhat enlightening. Shame.,1466121600,14,282,4.775510204081633
5406346,5,B00AAMIRTE,"This a life changing documentary. Not only did they confirm many of my beliefs, they also opened my mind to many issue I was awear of.",1464825600,,134,4.1923076923076925

5406348,5,B00AAMIRTE,"Everyone should watch this, not to propose a new way of thinking but rather an exposition to how consciousness plays out in a bigger scale than what our little minds are taught through conventional methods.",1460678400,2,206,4.914285714285715
8549212,5,B00AAMIRTE,This was  freaking sad but so true. i think everyone needs to view this !,1510185600,,73,3.8666666666666667
8549213,3,B00AAMIRTE,"Another ""connect the dots"" conspiracy movie, but well done.",1501804800,,59,5.666666666666667
8549214,2,B00AAMIRTE,I think it had potential but I just can't listen to the narrator's voice any longer.  I lasted about 10 min.  The voice was putting me to sleep.,1500768000,,144,4.107142857142857
8549215,5,B00AAMIRTE,Mind opening,1493769600,,12,5.5
8549216,1,B00AAMIRTE,"The premise is interesting. The story is hard to follow, it is just a series of images, and a long rambling narrative, it should have been much better presented with central themes highlighted. Very bad documentary.",1491696000,4,215,5.0
8549217,4,B00AAMIRTE,I think we should all be open to new ways of looking at our society. this documentary certainly presents some alternative insite into how our society is structured.  I was quite supprised at some of the information,1486252800,,214,4.783783783783784
8549218,5,B00AAMIRTE,Love this film. inspiring work!,1485388800,,31,5.4

8549220,5,B00AAMIRTE,Very illuminating... eager to see a sequel ;),1482969600,,45,4.75
8549221,5,B00AAMIRTE,"This film offers the viewer a lot of intense thoughts to ponder.  It also has some very graphic images that many reviewers are turned off by.  I believe this film will speak to those who feel the offsetting nature of the reality that they subscribe to. Perhaps you can't put your finger on it, but you feel it daily.  This will not speak to everyone, but for those it does it will be life changing.",1480809600,4,398,4.28
