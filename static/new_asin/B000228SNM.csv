8020328,2,B000228SNM,I liked the fact that it arrived timely. I didn't like the quality of the film itself. It was obvious that it was a home made copy. The audio was awful & the film grainy & at one point the finger of the person recording the film appeared on screen.,1518652800,,248,3.98

8020330,4,B000228SNM,"Very good performance for Mickey Rooney as the murderous Nelson who pushed his way to the #1 position of the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List after the death of John Dillinger.  Resentful of his not being taken seriously because of his size and looks, Nelson found that his urge for killing and a tommy gun made up the difference.  The movie also shows how the criminal had no loyalty to anyone.",1406073600,3,393,4.444444444444445
