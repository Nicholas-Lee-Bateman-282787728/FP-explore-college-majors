It is wonderful to see them all together making up a whole town. And then comes the story.
Feelings of pain, desperation, disillusion, wrath, revenge, redemption... go like a domino effect through each and every single one of the inhabitants of this town. They all change after this incident, because everybody was either with or against poor Eufemio Zrate (Aldama).
Eufemio's kid was sick and he was so desperate, he did something unforgivable. Somehow is caught and to make matters worse a little pig steals the scene with its antics. It is the Priest who have to settle matters down. After that, nobody will look at anybody else with the same eyes. Now they really know what's going on with them.
This movie is magic, reflects what each and everyone has inside and how they all react in a stressful situation in a very subtle and definitive way...",1316736000,,1045,4.779005524861878
