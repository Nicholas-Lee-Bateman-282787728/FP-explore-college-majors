8442544,4,B004V2D6O0,"Kachche Daage is not a great film, but it's highly watchable with some really fun moments. The songs are also excellent with the action is also good this movie also did good at the cinemas.people if you need to watch a movie on a Friday or Saturday this is what you need i was shocked at the very ending when ???????? turns out to be the villain and the action at the ending is A1. The songs like 'pyar Nanni kare'is the best. Don't forget this movie is a must see for all Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan fans",1304467200,3,507,4.08
