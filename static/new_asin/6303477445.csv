7849084,5,6303477445,I watched this movie years ago I really liked the movie its a great movie I don't really know what to say about the movie without telling you how it ends lets just say that a woman feels trapped between her husband and his commanding officer. But its what I would call a suspense thriller I wish they would put it on DVD I have the VHS I would recommend the movie I think you would enjoy it.,1376611200,,391,4.0256410256410255
7849085,4,6303477445,"As a big Peter Coyote fan, this is one of my favorite movies. Dysfunctional Coyote traps young army wives into his sexual schemes through intimidation. Favorite line in movies: ""I just want to be shotgun sure.""",1364169600,,210,4.861111111111111
7849086,1,6303477445,"I was expecting so much from this movie as it opened up, because it looked promising.
But, it became bad and got even worse and worse as it went along.
Terrible story, terrible direction, terrible plot, terrible acting, terrible, period.
Why, oh why, does hollywood continue to make these kind of films and waste our time, I will never know.",1188864000,,341,4.7
7849087,2,6303477445,"This movie is so bad it's good.  I'll admit it's kind of fun to watch because it's very campy but the story itself is ridiculous.  Peter Coyote stars as a lunatic Army colonel who regularly forces his junior officers' wives to have clandestine sex with him in his own private bunker.  Courtney Thorne Smith stars as the wife who has the guts to say no.

The story has no basis in reality and shouldn't be taken seriously, but I'll admit it kind of has a trainwreck appeal.",1180396800,,472,4.390804597701149
