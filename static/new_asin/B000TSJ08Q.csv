8210651,3,B000TSJ08Q,Not a bad CD to view live poker. Just way to much introduction and too much commentary for my liking.,1390176000,,101,4.1
8210652,5,B000TSJ08Q,"Great to see this on DVD!
I don't know if they all were made with this error, but DVD 1 shows just eposode #1 4 times (episodes 2-4 are not on the disc and nowhere on the set).

Cash Poker (the show) was produced during the Poker boom of 2007, unlike the norm back then of Poker on televisoon, which was all Tournamnets, this is a Cash game!
You will win more in cash games then tournaments (unless ofcourse you in the main event).
This DVD set will help your play in Cash poker better than any instructional poker dvd because your seeing it done, your seeing pros play, what they are playing and how they are playing it, great stuff, and that chick co-host is a hotty too.",1253750400,,673,4.217054263565892
8210653,5,B000TSJ08Q,"If you have ever watched High Stakes Poker on the Game Network and wondered if this is the way the top dogs really play cash games, then you will be relieved when you get this DVD series. It is well done,  informative and instructional. No you will not see a big raise from early position with an 8-4 offsuit, nor will you see players calling thousands (or ten's of thousands) of dollars with a flush draw on the river. What you will see is how the pros truely play the big cash games when the money is their own and they are trying to actually make money. The price for this set is very reasonable and any cash game player can learn from it. Highly recommended.",1225152000,,662,4.253968253968254
8210654,5,B000TSJ08Q,"The insert in my version of the 5-DVD set ""Cash Poker: The Ultimate Gamble (The Complete First Season)"" lists only the 20 episodes that are on the DVDs. However, I take the other reviewer's word for it that some episodes are missing and that this 5-DVD set is not really ""complete.""

I have watched every episode twice, and I have also watched every episode of the GSN show ""High Stakes Poker"" twice. In some respects, Cash Poker is superior, and although we see both experts and serious amateurs making interesting and educational moves in Hold'Em for real money in both series, the Cash Poker series is more realistic, possibly in part due to the lower stakes but also due to the selection of players. Why do I say this? Because the High Stakes Poker shows involve many of the egomaniacal ""stars of poker"" playing to the camera by deliberately delaying play to get extra airtime, showing off by ""making moves"" that are in many ways absurd (but ""look good for TV""), and talking excessively. Although there are ""action players"" (such as Bob Bright, Dustin Dirksen, and Nenad Medic) in Cash Poker, they play more astutely than the ""gamblers"" like Sammy Farha, Eli Elezra, and Jamie Gold on High Stakes Poker. The accompanying commentary by Brian Mollica is above average, with occasional guest announcers like Barry Greenstein and Kristy Gazes. And finally, the price of the set here on Amazon provides good value for the money.",1214870400,,1427,4.8244897959183675
8210655,3,B000TSJ08Q,"And the award for dumbest Dvd company on the planet goes to...Passport Video(the distributors of this Dvd set). Last year they were missing an episode from ""The Ultimate Poker Challenge:Season 2"", and this year they're missing 6 episodes. Each Dvd says it has approximately 233 minutes on it, when in fact they only have about 168 minutes on each. The box says it has approximately 1165 minutes for the set (233*5=1165). Sorry, but each dvd only has four, 41-42 minute episodes on it. Four episodes*42 minutes = 168 minutes per dvd. 5 dvds*168 minutes = 840 minutes, tops. I checked the titles to see that there wasn't a hidden 5th episode on each Dvd, but there wasn't. That's why all the previous sets had 8 dvds and not just 5 dvds like this year's. For shame!!!

Even the inner leaflet with the episode guide lists some episodes not on this dvd set. If you're curious, go to the cashpokertv site to see the proper 26 episode listing. Plus, many of the episodes on these dvds are in a different order than the websites. I realized they skipped episode #3 when in episode #4 on the dvd, they mentioned a great play by David Williams in last week's episode. That episode is nowhere to be found on these dvds.

So, you miss: one of Mike Matusow's and Layne Flack's episodes, Cyndy Violette's only episode, and both episodes that have Chad Brown doing commentary with his girlfriend Vanessa Rousso. Plus, no Roland De Wolfe (he's listed and pictured in the included episode leaflet). Only one of the two ""Best of"" episodes is here and I'm sure there's even more good stuff missing. At least all three Phil Laak episodes are included.

I'd like to give this set 4 stars because the poker is actually entertaining and it has several recognizable pros (both Brunsons, Corkins, Greenstein, Brown, Rousso, Gowan etc.) in almost every episode. But how on earth can they only release 5 of the minimum 7 dvds required, and still have the nerve to call this a complete season? Clearly, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie work for Passport Video. That's NOT hot!!

I guess Amazon owes me a refund (although it's so cheap, I'll most likely still keep it), but it's such a shame because this is very similar to ""Poker After Dark"", they both use chips and cash, except here in ""Cash Poker"", there's more table talk, it's not a tournament format, and it's rarely boring. In addition, although ""High Stakes Poker"" has better commentary and is a much slicker show, ""Cash Poker"" at least has enough big name poker stars and passable commentary by Brian Mollica (even though he often sounds too excited). He occasionally gets help from Jeff Madsen, Kristy Gazes, Mark Seif, Barry Greenstein, Chad Brown and Dan Harrington as well. At least now you know that this is NOT the complete season, and if you still decide to buy it, I suppose you could probably find the missing episodes somewhere on the internet anyway.

But once again, Passport Video has put me on tilt. It's time for this company to fold!",1194307200,14,2979,4.677480916030534
