Small town North Carolina is represented proudly in the film, via locations, story and a number of volunteer actors. The special effects are extremely good considering the tiny budget.

Go into it knowing that the humor is intentional, and you are in for 90 minutes of entertainment. Great soundtrack too, both score and incidental songs. Love that end title tune.",1319760000,2,508,5.035714285714286
8560733,4,B005V3V56Y,Entertaining. Special effects very decent. Story line is good. Decent movie made on a budget. Wouldn't be surprised if this movie wouldn't be a classic like Evil Dead. May have some future major movie makers here.,1319673600,,213,4.944444444444445
