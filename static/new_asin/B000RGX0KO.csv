SWORD FISH IS CRSTAL CLEAR WITH DEEP BASS SOUND (HALLE B.B.BEST)ROAD WARRIOR LOOKS GOOD AS A VERY OLD MID BUDGET MOVIE. TRAINING DAY IS ACCEPTABLE & LETHAH WEAPHON IS THE WEAKEST. BUT CONSIDERING THE LOW PRICE TAG, THIS IS A VERY GOOD PURCHASE.",1271980800,,485,4.329670329670329
8200669,3,B000RGX0KO,"while you will most certainly see a difference while watching in hi-def the improvement in quality does not justify the price, however, if you are buying because you want these films for your library go for it. i have seen prices higher for standard dvd's.",1264809600,,256,4.711111111111111

Here is some important info that Amazon left out:

- All four movies are in 1080p.
- Lethal Weapon is the only @ 1.85:1 aspect ratio.
- The other 3 movies are 2.4:1.
- All feature Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Each of the blu-ray discs include the original ""blu"" protective case, complete with insert. All four cases slide into a cardboard cover that resembles the product photo on this page. This is much better than some of the collections I have on DVD where each disc is in a flimsy paper sleeve. I included a few photos (check customer images) of the box/packaging.

Note: The individual cases are not factory shrink-wrapped but they do include the white plastic seal/tape that goes over the top. I imagine this is important to those who had plans on selling or gifting any movies they didn't like from the set. Not that you would do that. :)",1201046400,14,1282,5.592783505154639
