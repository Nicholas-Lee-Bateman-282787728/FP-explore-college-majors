3048822,5,B0010EI3JU,"I wasn't exactly expecting much, but boy was I wrong!  Yes, it's a bit corny, but how deliciously so! Imagine ""I Love Lucy"", only replace it with ""I Love the USAF"", pack it with airplanes, manly men, a few cigarettes, toss in a thermonuclear bomb here and there, and voila: Steve Canyon. It's a great window into the 1950's America and USAF. Loved every minute of it. Can't wait for the remaining episodes.",1212364800,3,406,4.561643835616438
3048823,5,B0010EI3JU,"This sampler is so great in so many ways. Be you a fan of Caniff, or the titular strip, or the US Air Force, or jet aicraft, you have to be pleased with this. I'm so amped, I cant wait for the complete series to be released. I watched the series when it first aired and I loved it then. I was 8 years old, my dad was in the Air Force, and the F-100 was my favorite airplane (see the first episode on the disc). One memory I have from the series that stayed with me was an episode involving a C-128 Globemaster and a Paratrooper whose chute gets hung up on the rear of the plane. Steve comes up with the idea of having a convertible car follow the plane down the runway and cutting the guy lose before the plane slows down too much so he won't hit the ground. I later joined the AF myself and spent most of some 23 years in SAC around B-52's and KC-135's. I even spent one tour at Castle AFB (see the dedication following the 2nd episode on this disc). The show may seem corny to some now, but if you grew up reading Steve Canyon or remember the Cold War years you should like this series.  The transfers from the original film are so good I don't think I've seen better. I'm sure we could't see the show as clearly on our old tv back then but I'm really happy to be able to see it again.",1205971200,2,1287,3.988372093023256
3048824,5,B0010EI3JU,"The Steve Canyon Special Edition DVD is, in a word, fantastic! These four selected episodes are as sharp, crisp and clear as any DVD releases of television shows from that period that I've seen. Even perfectionists should find nothing to complain about. If these represent episodes that are not yet ""fully restored,"" the final release of the entire series, fully restored, should be nothing short of spectacular. Even if you are sure that you'll buy the complete series, you should pick up this sampler. It will whet your appetite for more, and you will be contributing to the restoration expenses for the remaining 30 episodes.

""Steve Canyon"" is one of the things that inspired me to become an aerospace engineer (my other inspirations were the ""Men Into Space"" television series, Chesley Bonestell's astronomical art and the ""Sky Masters of the Space Force"" comic strip). Watching these four episodes was a most enjoyable trip back in time for me. I still vividly remember a couple of episodes that are not on this Special Edition DVD, and I'm very anxious to see how accurate my memory is when the full series is released. If you've ever even heard the words ""Steve"" and ""Canyon"" used together, you need this DVD.

Kudos to John Ellis of the Milton Caniff Estate and to everyone working on this project. This DVD brought back a lot of pleasant memories for this baby boomer, and I'm waiting most impatiently for the rest of the show. I give it my highest possible recommendation.",1203379200,20,1483,4.834645669291339
3048825,5,B0010EI3JU,"I watched this series as a 10 year old boy.  I was so excited when I discovered that ""Steve Canyon"" was coming to DVD this year.  I ordered the DVD as soon as I could directly from the vendor and received it within one week.

I was taken back in time watching the promo DVD.  The theme music and opening and closing scenes really awakened long lost memories.  Everything about the disk is first-class!  The picture quality is great along with the stories.  Watching it is like traveling in a time machine back to a simpler era.  The bad . . .I have restricted myself to one episode per week so that I am not finished viewing it too fast.  I can't wait for the full series to come out!  I'll be the first in line to buy it!

This is one of those programs that had a profound effect upon me and brother as young children.  I became a pilot and aircraft mechanic as a result of this series.  Although my eyes were too bad for the military, my brother at least had good enough vision to become a Marine aviator.",1203292800,2,1007,4.182291666666667

Just knowing her from ""Happy Days"", I had no idea that at one time she was a little hottie!  The collection is clearly a labor of love and if enough of us support the special edition we can look forward to the complete series showing up on DVD.

Don't be skeptical about the restoration either - it too was professionally done and is crisp, sharp, and clean as a whistle.  Don't expect too many ""commercials"" for products but you will see a few as well as promotional spots for other TV shows aired on ABC, the re-run syndication network which these prints are mostly from.

Get yourself a copy today as these sales of the sampler will determine the complete season episode release later 2008.  You won't regret it.

3048828,5,B0010EI3JU,This is a very special sample of four beautifully restored episodes of the original 1958-59 season ABC series Steve Canyon. I became a fan from the first episode and marvel at the scenes of vintage air force bases and all of the air force aircraft of both sub and sonic age. Dean Fredericks is very credible in the role of Colonel Steve Canyon. The episodes were made with the backing of the United States Air Force and cover a variety of topics/plots. You won't be disappointed. I am anxiously awaiting the release of the remaining episodes later this summer.,1203033600,2,560,4.666666666666667
3048829,5,B0010EI3JU,"This really is a cause for rejoicing (considering the time of the year!) also the news that the 36 episode series will follow next year, the return of Steve Canyon in beautifully, crisp, clean, fully-restored episodes. I have the promo dvd here and the Milton Caniff Estate is to be congratulated on a terrific job. I have always wanted this series ever since I was a kid, the theme of Walter Schumann (Dragnet) with that shot of the planes' underbelly as it took off is something I've always remembered. Star Dean Fredericks is most credible in the title role and the Caniff Estate has promised a documentary on him when the full series arrives next year. there is a restoration doco on this disc and a promo short that is very interesting also. I eagerly await the release, next year of the rest of the episodes, cause they'll be going into my collection, that's for sure.",1196812800,12,874,4.608974358974359
3048830,5,B0010EI3JU,"I knew of Steve Canyon as a newspaper comic. I did not know it had been a 1958 television show as well. I checked it out on this special edition DVD, and it COMPLETELY blew me away! The first thing that grabs the viewer is that actor Dean Fredericks looks just like his comic pages counterpart, and is fantastic in the role. 4 episodes are present on this special edition and the quality is unbelievable. As I understand it, this was one of the most expensive television shows at the time, and it certainly shows! Action is jammed packed into every story and is beautifully done. Well directed, acted, and produced! I was glad to see it also came with a promo feature, and a stills gallery. I am looking forward to picking up the full series on DVD. Highly recommended!",1351468800,2,769,4.460992907801418

3048833,5,B0010EI3JU,"I have more of a personal recollection of the famed comic strip than I do the 1958 television show based on the adventures of STEVE CANYON.  However, although I have no interest in the military or in jet airplanes, I cut my teeth on John Wayne movies at my mother's side.  When Duke chased America's enemies in his fighter jets, I felt exhilaration.  As I got older, I learned to appreciate good writing, good acting and good production values.  When I received the Special Edition DVD of STEVE CANYON, the four episodes featured provided exhilarating storylines with good writing, good acting and good production values.

Dean Fredericks charmingly brings to life the character of Steve Canyon.  He is matched with equally likeable supporting actors, including Abel Fernandez and Robert Hoy.  Guest stars will surprise the viewer.  One will see a number of familiar faces in the early stages of their careers--actors such as STAR TREK stars DeForest Kelley and Leonard Nimoy, Marion Ross (HAPPY DAYS), Richard Anderson (THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN), and many others.

I have obtained not only the Special Edition offered here, but also Volumes One and Two, and have not been disappointed in adding these fine DVDs to my collection.  In fact, each new episode is more thrilling than the previous one!  I look forward to the final volume of the series, which should be released next year.

I've also enjoyed the old commercials for products and other television shows of the era, which are quite a contrast to what we see today.  Commentaries led by producer, John Ellis, as he draws out the actors, writers, and others involved in the production of this fine series are also a revelation.  Ellis has remastered the 1958 films with new technology so that the picture is clear and bright, probably better than viewing them on the old black-and-white televisions available in the late 50's.

If you enjoy classic television, dramas about the military, the Air Force, fighter jets, the Steve Canyon comic strip, or just plain enjoy GOOD entertainment, I highly recommend the STEVE CANYON SPECIAL EDITION dvd.",1259884800,2,2103,4.968571428571429
3048834,5,B0010EI3JU,"I just enjoyed this DVD about the fantastic adventures of Steve Canyon, a Colonel of the US Air Force, I assume it was a rare edition because I never saw that series in France before, it comes from a comics and came on TV in 1948.

Part of my obsession with airplanes and my continuing 30 year career in aviation is directly attrituable to Steve Canyon, and the Blue Angels series that aired during the 50's.

Buy this DVD, buy the series when it comes out, and see how the Air Force and the Cold War was portrayed back when your baby boomer father, mother, grandfather and grandmother were kids.

8237792,4,B0010EI3JU,"Amazingly good quality video from 1960s B&W TV film.  As a retired career Air Force officer, I was amazed at the accuracy of most of their stories, though most were obviously stretched a bit for dramatic effect or operational security.  They got the military personal grooming standards of the time correct, often overlooked in Hollywood.

If you have a nostalgic love for ""The Real Air Force,"" you'll love this series.",1424131200,,419,4.957142857142857

8237798,5,B0010EI3JU,"First off, please note the review is not of the special edition DVD alone. Read on:
 After being ""lost"" since 1960, the TV series ""Steve Canyon"" has returned to the screen. Through the efforts of John Ellis and the Milton Caniff  estate, the series is at last available on DVD. In 2008 a four episode preview was released that told many baby boomers that our USAF hero was coming home. Well, Steve is home. The first two volumes of the episodes from 1958 that made up the only season of the show are issued, and the third and final installment  DVD is soon to appear. What a great effort. and what a great show! Buy these DVDs, you can't go wrong. Read the other reviews...we're all saying the same thing. The image and sound quality are better than the originals due to digital technology. Mr. Ellis has added commentary tracks available for most episodes that just give a wealth of info the the interested viewer as well as tell how and why the show became a one season wonder. NBC dropped the ball there, but the bottom line will always be economics, not the arts.
 It has been worth the wait to see these again. ""TOP GUN"" of it's day, USAF cooperation obviously helped, along with a cast and crew that wanted to make a quality product. The star, Dean Fredericks simply WAS Steve Canyon. He really looked like the comic strip character. The idea of the program being based on a comic strip somewhat hurt the image and reception of the program with adults in the 1950s; today we would say the adventure series based on the graphic novels of Canyons' exploits. That would help if the series were being pitched-look at ""The Walking Dead"" TV series as case in point. But that's just ""what if?"" reasoning...still, if the superheroes can all be reborn into major theatrical films at the cineplex, it makes me think: ""STEVE CANYON-THE MOVIE"". Boy, he'd be a natural in an F-16 or F15 today!!!
  You won't be disappointed in this set. My pre-order for DVD #3 is already in.",1362182400,2,1968,4.529577464788733
