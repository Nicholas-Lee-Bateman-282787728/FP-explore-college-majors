It was like a regular horror anime to me with SOME intense scenes, I will stick to the La Blue Girl collection, which I think was better in my opinion.",1457568000,2,243,4.674418604651163
7942723,1,B00005K3NL,Horrible I remember watching it back when I was at my friend apartment and the movie was gross and the story didn't make any sense.,1442880000,,131,4.28

7942725,1,B00005K3NL,"Very old themed anime which isn't a problem.
I had a problem that a mother would just immediately kill her child instead of doing anything to try to save her only child from a man that she claimed to love that had also died.",1408320000,,224,4.113636363636363
7942726,5,B00005K3NL,"I fchose this rating even though I haven't had the time to watch it yet, but will soon. I wanted this title for some time and didn't think I would ever be able to get it. But here it is. Great to go with Demon Beast Ressurection, which I already had. I did have some snags on getting this, but they were resolved both by the seller and through the great reps at Amazon. The hang up was in gettin the cover box, which I did eventually get. Can't wait to watch along with it's sequel. Great for fans on horror.",1367107200,,508,4.03960396039604
