8076560,2,B000AA4GJG,"These are only comments, NOT a full-fledged review of this documentary.

I was VERY disappointed with the disc.  No insight whatsoever into what made AH the truly great artist/film director he was.  Just really a year-by-year biography that those of us who treasure his many fine films have encountered elsewhere over the years of reading about him and watching those 53 or 54 films.

ONLY the truly uninitiated have much to learn here.  Otherwise, save your money. Better yet, put it toward an AH film your collection is lacking.",1390262400,2,530,4.910112359550562
8076561,3,B000AA4GJG,"Picked up this little collection today for 10 bucks at a used dvd store.  The documentary, ""More than Just a Profile"" is a decent introduction to the great one, but it is lacking in quality footage overall.  While it has some unique information in it (like a possible affair by Alma, Hitch's wife), there is not much else that is worthwhile in it.  Furthermore, the unnecessary hyperbole at the end is really distracting (which is unfortunate, as the final 10 minutes of the documentary are the best).

The best part of the collection for me, are the 20 trailers.  Hitch's trailers were the best.  Very worthwhile to have all in one place and a joy to watch (especially the trailer for ""Trouble with Harry"").  A lot of fun!  Definitely worth the money if you are looking for a good introduction to Hitch or if you are wanting a cheap collection of the great one's trailers.",1260403200,6,873,4.587096774193548
