8496158,5,B006BZ8NC0,I loved this show when it was first on tv but between work and other activities was never able to see all of the episodes.  being able to get multiple seasons on one order was a good deal. my sister was happy about it too because she was able to borrow the first one when i moved onto the second one.  the show is defiantly different so i suggest doing to previews before investing in the complete seasons.,1380412800,,406,4.1923076923076925
8496159,5,B006BZ8NC0,"my friend had a stroke and has aphasia. It was really bad at first last year. Was unable to watch any TV... the News, Sesame Street... cooking shows.... it was just ""noise"".  since Fringe was a favorite show and episodes were viewed many times, we rented them again and again;  he was able to watch them and bring forward memories.  I believe the familiarity and the enjoyment helped his brain re-learn pathways that were interrupted by the stroke.  Fringe helped him focus and with the captioning he was able to recognize some of the words, learning to read all over again, which through a year of intensive speech therapy has now progressed to just about all of the words.  Thanks for the help, Fringe Division!",1367020800,,713,4.672

8496161,5,B006BZ8NC0,"Fringe is probably the best show ever produced for television! You won't be able to stop watching! After the first episode you get interested. After the first season you get hooked. By the final, fifth season you'll start all over again because it is that good! And beware!! I guarantee you will not be able to watch only one episode at-a time! You'll find yourself watching four or five.",1363824000,,388,4.63768115942029
8496162,5,B006BZ8NC0,If your in the market for the first two seasons of fringe this is a great deal. The first two season are the best ones anyways.,1362096000,,127,3.923076923076923
8496163,5,B006BZ8NC0,Don't watch the first episode unless you dedicate enough time to watch them all! You will become addicted after the pilot show..,1361404800,,128,4.863636363636363
