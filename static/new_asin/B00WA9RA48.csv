7127044,5,B00WA9RA48,"Very funny show. Available in other formats, but there's a good chance this version will feature DVD commentary and/or other extras, based on Instagrams from @garfunkeloates and @thefredsavage in late 2014. Giving 5 stars in advance. Screen cap attached.

EDIT: I've viewed the DVD and here is an update:

Disk 1 contains Episodes 1-4
Disk 2 contains Episodes 5-8

And, EVERY SINGLE EPISODE has an audio commentary track by creators/executive producers/stars Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucci along with executive producer and series director Fred Savage.

There are no other extras, nor did I spot any Easter eggs.

That's more audio commentary than you usually get on TV DVD releases, and much of it is worthwhile.

There are lots of behind-the-scenes anecdotes, and shout-outs to the terrific guest cast (which consists of lots of talented comedian friends of the band, with the extra coup of Sir Ben Kingsley in a small but memorable role), and recognition of the creative-on-a shoestring-budget production teams.

You get insights into some of the background music featured on the show, and some material that was shot and then repurposed from an unaired pilot. (The unaired HBO pilot, or something shot for IFC and shelved? Not clear.) Credit is given to the significant improvised contributions by many of the funny guest stars, who expanded tiny scripted roles into comedy gold.

You also get to learn which were Riki's good and bad hair days; what situations motivate her best acting; how she is actually taller than at least some houses; and, she takes the opportunity to get some continuity problems off her chest. You learn who drew some of the background art (Kate); who recorded some incidental music in her closet (Kate); and hear Kate and Fred finally share a special moment that was decades in the making. The previously closely-held secrets of how Kate sleeps, flirts, and winks are at last revealed. And, it turns out they actually do know how to make sandwiches, though they have a complicated relationship with cold cuts.

This DVD is an IFC TV network release, distributed through Anchor Bay, a company that is apparently licensed to distribute IFC TV original programming.

IFC cancelled the TV show after one season, and is no longer promoting it nor promoting this DVD. And, there's a long list of TV titles previously distributed by Anchor Bay that are now out of print [...]
SECOND EDIT:

IFC did not actually cancel the show. They wanted the show to continue, but producing it was impossible because Riki Lindhome was already committed to doing the show ""Another Period"" on Comedy Central with Natasha Leggero. Apparently they all really tried to make it work, but there was no way. People keep asking if there will be more, and why it was cancelled.... so that's the answer.

So, if you're a fan interested in actually owning a copy of these episodes or hearing the commentaries, grab this fun little gem while it's available.",1432252800,13,2952,4.9655172413793105

8712585,4,B00WA9RA48,"The package contains 2-DVDs with 8 episodes of the Garfunkel and Oates show. Each of the episodes are very funny. The writing is sharp and acting very funny, so I'm sure the DVD will hold up well to repeated viewings. In addition each episode contains a full commentary track from the two stars and director. The commentary tracks are interesting and provide some insight to each of the episodes. - I only wish they'd included a couple of more special features. The commentary tracks are fun, but an extra music video or live performances would have been a nice plus.",1435449600,8,567,4.68
