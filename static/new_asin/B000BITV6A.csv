2418008,4,B000BITV6A,"This is a nice, competent little comedy built from crime story elements, and quite enjoyable. Considering its a Danziger Brothers poverty row production, St. Benny the Dip is blessed with a marvelous cast. Dick Haymes, Lionel Stander, and Cosmo Topper himself, Roland Young, play a trio of small time hoodlums who disguise themselves as priests to escape a police dragnet. Finding themselves in an abandoned Bowery mission, the threesome take their masquerade to extremes, holding services and feeding the poor. This marvelous tale of redemption also stars a luminous Nina Foch as love interest and Freddie Bartholomew in his final screen appearance. This is perhaps the first and so far only noir-comedy ever made, with some very fine black and white location photography by Don Malkames, whose career took him from Yiddish pictures to 'race' films. John Roeburt's screenplay is consistently intelligent and amusing. The film's low budget is apparent, but its clear everyone involved was working very hard to make a quality picture, and they succeeded.",1421971200,4,1053,5.311377245508982
2418009,1,B000BITV6A,"I bought this movie because it has Freddie Bartholomew in it.  But, much to my disappointment, it is a very low budget movie, and Freddie has only a small role.  It is nothing like Captains Courageous or any of his other wonderful movies.

This DVD ended up in the trash, because I would be embarrassed to even give it away to someone.",1354060800,2,335,4.370967741935484

8087094,4,B000BITV6A,"When noticing this movie starred a young Lionel Stander (Max from TV's Hart to Hart) and Nina Foch (Ducky Mallard's mother on N.C.I.S) I couldn't pass it up. I'm glad I didn't. The story has been done many times before (3 hoods go straight) but looking back this may have been one of the first times it was ever done.

Dick Haymes, Lionel Stander and Roland Young (Cosmo Topper from the Topper movie series) play 3 swindlers on the run from the police who hide in plain sight disguised as ministers. Yes, it's an old premise but unlike other times played for laughs there are just as many heartfelt moments here. While this could be watched any time of the year it has the feel of a beautiful Christmas movie at times. Each of the three men has his own ""cross to bare"" and watching them each ""grow up"" and face their demons is very heartening at times. The best part of it all, I'd say, is that like many true classics, this movie is safe for the entire family and quite enjoyable to boot.",1486598400,,989,4.345945945945946

8087100,4,B000BITV6A,"Interesting look at the way criminals were viewed in the 1930s... the best thing to do was not to lock them up away from people, but instead get them to serve others and become profitable members of society again.

Three criminals, in their attempt to escape the police, changed into Reverends' robes. Somehow they are cornered into serving in an old mission and they all change because of it. Not to give anything away, but none of them are the same after that, and everyone is better for it. At some point the police and local minister is onto them, but they don't let on, because helping others is better than jail time... novel idea!!!  ;)

A great little ol' timey piece for the whole family.",1461110400,,697,4.515873015873016

8087102,5,B000BITV6A,"I watched this movie in some package of films on DVD that weren't in the best of shape, and was immediately taken by it. My only cavil would be I'd like to see it in a better print. I can't speak for this Alpha Video release, because I've had some DVDs from them that don't play at all on my player, while others play fine. I have no idea why. However, the camera work in this film is very well done. The film is at once fast-paced and subtle. I could almost believe that P.G. Wodehouse wrote it, the plot is so contrived. However, in my view, it's not heavy-handed. This is due to the incredible subtlety of the actors. In my view, Dick Haymes has never been better, and ought to get an Oscar. Roland Young is more in the role of Cosmo Topper than he is in the Topper films, and plays that character with zest. This plays like a much older movie, unlike some films of the fifties, and is satisfying like movies used to be.",1456790400,,923,4.162011173184357
