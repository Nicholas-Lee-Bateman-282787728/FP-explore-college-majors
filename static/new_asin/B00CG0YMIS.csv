A very enjoyable and informative documentary that I highly recommend to any who remember life before word processing or those interested in taking a look back.

5721918,4,B00CG0YMIS,"On April 19, 2013 I traveled to Austin, Texas and enjoyed a program at the University of Texas that included a free screening of a documentary fllm, ""The Typewriter in the 21st Century."" The film is now available in a DVD which I ordered from Amazon.com for my own collection. This  review is based on information obtained at the Austin screening, plus facts from the film's website and my own observations:

According to the website: ""The film was inspired by a May, 2010 article in Wired magazine called ""Meet The Last Generation of Typewriter Repairman."" Director Christopher Lockett and Producer Gary Nicholson discussed the importance of the typewriter in 20th Century literature. The conclusion being that every great novel of the 20th Century was written on one, and if typewriters are in their final days, they deserved to be celebrated one last time.

""It only took a few interviews to determine that the typewriter and its legion of fans is far from dead. By the time the ""Last Typewriter Factory Closes Its Doors"" article went viral in April of 2011, Lockett and Nicholson were not only already making the film, they were convinced they had a much bigger story on their hands. They did.

""Funded largely through Kickstarter, the film eventually featured not only typewriter people - the aforementioned technicians, collectors, bloggers, users and fans - but famous typewriters as well. The film features machines once owned by Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Tennessee Williams, John Steinbeck, Jack London, Sylvia Plath, George Bernard Shaw, John Lennon, Joe DiMaggio, Helen Keller, The Unabomber, John Updike, Ray Bradbury and Ernie Pyle.""

If you're into collecting typewriters, as I am, or just want to know more about this remarkable machine that changed the world in ways we aren't even aware of, ""The Typewriter in the 21st Century"" is worth acquiring.

It's a relatively short -- about 58 minutes --  film about a machine and the people who use, love and repair it.

Lockett and Nicholson interviewed more than 30 people in 10 U.S. states, talking  with authors, collectors, journalists, professors, bloggers, students, artists, inventors and repairmen (and women) who meet up for `Type-In' gatherings to both celebrate and use their decidedly lo-tech typewriters in a plugged-in world.

The film features authors Robert Caro and David McCullough - 4 Pulitzer Prizes, 3 National Book Awards and a Presidential Medal of Freedom between them - both typewriter users. They have a lot to say about process and the value of slowing down, writing actual drafts and revising in a world of instant, draft-less editing.

While the film's budget was meager and about as independent as filmmaking gets, its scope is broad and deep. To borrow a phrase from boxing, it punches above its weight. Discussions range from American manufacturing - David McCullough has typed everything he has ever written on the same machine, one he has owned since 1965 - to the philosophy of the creative mind.

Richard Polt, Chair of the Philosophy Department at Xavier University and a chief figure in the Typosphere, an online community of bloggers, collectors and enthusiasts, likens using a typewriter to riding a bicycle. ""It's about enjoying the ride. I think typewriters will persist... as a healthy, meaningful alternative to the most efficient way of doing things.""

Author Lynn Peril talks about the early history the machine and how the word ""typewriter"" described both the machine and the person using it: ""The typewriter is the one piece of office technology that allowed women to move from the home to the professional work force.""

Manson Whitlock, at age 95 the oldest person in the film and likely the oldest working typewriter repairman in America, is blunt about it: ""I think that something that was made to be thrown away ought never to have been made at all.""

For Arizona high school English teacher Ryan Adney, who uses typewriters in his classroom, an essential part of a writer's process is revision. ""That process is lost when you're editing on the fly,"" he says. ""And you're working without a net,"" he says, ""no spell check. I've measured a 68-72 percent improvement in my students spelling abilities once they started using typewriters.""

For soldiers Peter Meijer and Alan Beck, sending typewritten letters from the front lines in Afghanistan and Iraq was a very different way of communicating than email. Meijer said: ""One woman I sent letters to, when I visited her on leave, carried those letters around with her in her purse. You don't get that with email.""

Lockett was surprised that Jack Zylkin, inventor of the USB Typewriter - a modification that allows a manual typewriter to be used with an iPad or any computer monitor with a USB input - is something of a technophobe. An electrical engineer by training, Zylkin ""couldn't stand interfacing with a screen all day and then doing it again when I came home."" A typewriter lover, he said his invention ""is less about updating the typewriter and more about re-introducing a wonderful machine that still works, to this generation.""

The repairmen who keep these venerable old machines oiled, inked and click-clacking along are of course happy to see a renewed interest in the typewriter. But they know more than most, as repairman Ermanno Marzorati says, ""the enemy is time."" New typewriter parts are just hard to come by.

Repairmen Ruben Flores and Bill Wahl talk about the inventory of older machines they have to cannibalize to keep customers' machines working. Even award-winning writer Robert Caro isn't immune to the ravages of time: ""When I started the last book, I had 17. I'm down to 11 now,"" Caro says.

But, as blogger Michael Clemens points out, ""Typewriters were designed to be your lifetime machine. The longest I've had a laptop work was for nine years. Yet I have typewriters that are more than 50 years old and I write with them every day.""

Alaska-based singer-songwriter Marian Call uses a typewriter as a percussion instrument. ""Nothing else makes that sound. And it brings with it a flood of memories,"" she says. ""When I first took the typewriter out on tour, only a few people had them. But this last tour, a lot of people had them. When I asked them `Why?' they all said `Because typewriters don't have Facebook.' ""

That is a recurring theme of the film - people need a place to unplug and be alone with their thoughts. A typewriter offers that - and the same QWERTY keyboard that's on our laptops and smart phones. As author Darryl Rehr points out, ""That QWERTY keyboard came out of the Remington plant in 1874.""

For a 19th Century invention, the typewriter and the typewriter scene the film documents is surprisingly vital. Compared with some of the people in the documentary, my collection of Olivettis, Olympias, Smith Coronas, Royals and Remingtons -- to name a few brands -- is modest, but when I think back on my career on five daily newspapers -- including almost 15 years at the Los Angeles Times and 10 years at The Milwaukee Sentinel I marvel at how my touch-typing facility at the typewriter eased my work. I'm glad I was one of only a few boys who took typing at Rochelle (IL) Township High School in the 1950s!",1371513600,7,7222,4.925925925925926
5721919,5,B00CG0YMIS,I had know idea about the wonderful sub culture of the typewriter. This doc is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone. Great flick!,1369785600,,136,4.48
5721920,5,B00CG0YMIS,"This film does an excellent job of telling the story of typewriters and those who love, use and repair them. I was impressed by the depth of the interviews, especially with award-winning authors like David McCullough and Robert Caro. Their descriptions of how their writing is more deliberate on a typewriter than a computer were engaging and convincing.

I did not realize the key role that typewriters played in allowing women to enter the workforce.

The interviews with the typewriter repairmen and women were especially poignant. Hopefully there are enough old typewriters for spares to last another generation.

Collectors, members of the ""typosphere"" (bloggers who type their blog on a typewriter then scan it and post it online), and innovators in art, music, poetry and technology (yes, a USB manual typewriter!) are featured. An intrepid high school english teacher shows that students are improving their spelling and writing skills since he brought typewriters into his classroom.

The film features typewriters from the collection of Steve Soboroff, who owns typewriters used by Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac and many others.

This film should encourage viewers to find the old family manual typewriter and take it for a spin. Typospherians (bloggers and their readers), collectors, and the curious will all find something in the beautiful footage and interviews.",1369526400,5,1377,5.386046511627907

5721937,5,B00CG0YMIS,"You like typed words if you are reading this review and considering this movie. Great start!

I am a writer.  I just bought a 1958 Royal Futura 800 from Bob Green in Amherst (one of the gentlemen interviewed in this movie).  I love it.  It has changed my writing world.

The typewriter is there when I am ready to write.  There is more to it than just not being distracted by the laptop fan and internet.  The manual typewriter sits precisely where you left it, at one spot on the page, whether you go away for a minute, or for a day.  The next key you hit is the next printed letter, regardless of when you hit it.  There is no screensaver.  There is no hibernation.  There is no re-booting. It is silent and ready, a sentry with one purpose: to put my thoughts immediately to paper.

Why use a typewriter as an author?  It makes me think.  I can type faster than I can think; I needed a set of ""brakes"" to slow down; a computer keyboard and mouse was not enough. It's the difference between driving and walking.  Drive a car along the winding road through the woods and you will get to the end faster.  But, walk the edge of the winding road and you will feel the cool air and smell the woods.  You will hear the birds.  You will sense fear when you hear a rustling in the brush from an unseen animal.  You will get wet when it starts raining.

The typewriter is a walk, not a drive. It is feeling, not just doing.

You enjoy the editing first on the paper itself, a tactile experience.  You have a stack of pages that you can scribble on.  You can jot notes.  You can add arrows and circles and squares and your own personal symbols that you cannot do with editing on a computer.

I own an Apple Macbook Pro and a Windows PC, but I no longer use them for first drafts.  I use the Royal Futura. Then, when I have the original typed draft and a thorough edit on the typed page with swirling red pencil and little smiles next to the parts I like, I read it all into Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition software directly into the word processing software.  It's amazing the mistakes I pick up--dialogue that is unnatural to the ear, word redundancies, etc.--that I immediately fix after I've read the piece into MS Word.  So, by then, I have the rough draft, the first pencil edit, and now a read-out-loud edit, all before I have composed with one key on the PC. It's a great feeling of mastery. I now have the computer copy to share, email, edit further and tweak to my hearts content.  It's amazing how few think of the eighty dollar voice recognition software that can release a writer from the single most noted reason for not writing on a typewriter: the editing.

I can bring my manual typewriter to the kitchen table, to the desk by the window, or to a card table set up by a lake on a sunny day; no power cord, no batteries.  My fingers provide the energy of the word by moving the keys and creating the strikes.  If I'm angry, they strike hard and make big dark letters.  If I'm sad, they are faint.  The print expresses my emotions, hard or soft, just as piano keys under the fingertips of an accomplished pianist.

Mr. Green at Amherst Typewriter in Massachusetts reminded me of another advantage of the typewriter: A computer printer will run out of ink suddenly, and usually at midnight, just before the school paper is due.  The typewriter ribbon simply becomes ever so slowly more faint, and never quits abruptly.  It is changed only when you, the writer, can no longer read it.  Only when you say it's done.  (Ribbons for mainstream vintage machines are still available from many sources, including Amazon, for about eight bucks a ribbon for a few hundred pages; reasonable compared to a sixty dollar printer ink cartridge.)

If I send you a letter hand-written, you may not be able to read my penmanship, my curse since childhood.  If I email you, you will read it quickly and it will go to your ""dead email"" file and someday be purged.  If I hand or mail you or a typed note, with the quirky dropped ""k""s and unique font of my own Royal, you will study it and read it--twice, maybe even three times--and you will think about it.  You may or may not save it, but you will at least think about it.  That is all I can ask as a writer.

This one hour documentary covers some, but not all, of what I have written here.  I wanted to share my joy of my new machine and hope that, buoyed by the enthusiasm of the young people in this movie, old machines will live forever.  There is no product manufactured with the mechanical precision and intricacy these days as a vintage USA-made typewriter.  It is, as the movie states, functional art.

I appreciate this movie greatly.  Numerous interviews and rapid editing make for a wonderful gem of a movie.  I enjoyed seeing the current authors, as well as the craftsmen (and young women) that continue to repair these useful relics.  The movie is fast-paced and informative.  I will watch it again in a  week or two.  I was going to put a reminder to do so in my iPhone, but instead I just typed a reminder on an index card and Scotch taped it to the side of my computer monitor.

Now I know I won't forget.

Thank you for a wonderful movie.",1380499200,10,5203,4.350311850311851
5721938,5,B00CG0YMIS,"There is more to this documentary than just discussing a sub-culture of typewriter fashion.

I certainly would not want to insult Robert Caro or David McCullough (who both use a typewriter and appear in this documentary) by typing OMG, LOL or FML in my correspondence on a machine which they have used to win Pulitzers. So, I will not buy and use a typewriter to send 140 character or less letters to friends, most of whom are from Facebook so they may not even be human. I do recommend that anyone that likes a light, fast interesting documentary watch The Typewriter in the 21st Century. It is really good.

The older interviewees remind us of the sustainability of the typewriter and the younger ones display an appreciation for the inter-generational connection while also bringing their own personal identities to their usage.
