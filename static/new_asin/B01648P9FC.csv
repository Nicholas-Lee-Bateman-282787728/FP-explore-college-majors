By doing so they heap dishonor upon the men and women like those in this fine documentary, and many others who never had the opportunity to experience the happiness and prosperity that America offers to its Citizens & in turn dishonor the many brave and honorable combatants that America faced on the field of battle on Iwo Jima and countless other places. This is only the opinion of one man. Myself. One day I hope to see a more reasonable and leavened acceptance by all the citizens of the world of the ever so sad truth that in order to continue and further peaceful coexistence globally, at different times, in different places, it is necessary for men and women to offer themselves up to the ultimate sacrifice of their lives to maintain that peace and prosperity for  America and the world.
There are honorable men and women on both sides of most armed conflicts, and in no way should their sacrifice be dishonoredor demeaned by the criticism and venal derogation of people who have never heard a shot fired in anger nor known any thing, place or ideal that would be worth the willing sacrifice of their very lives, or known the sadness and grief that accompanies the death of a Brother or Sister in arms.
This fine documentary does justice to and honors the brave men who ""Put it all on the line"" during the battle of Iwo Jima, on both sides, and it would be a damnable shame for their actions to be belittle by those who seek nothing more than to further a, at best, temporary political agenda, or misguided vision of ""How things ought to be"".
A fine production that does justice to and honors those who fought on both sides of this bloody and desperate for a small island that now offers mute testimony in honor of the great efforts and immense sacrifices of all who fought there.",1531440000,,2020,4.626740947075209

8735630,5,B01648P9FC,"I've had the pleasure of meeting CPT Yellen. This documentary captures the story of this remarkable Anerican. He has now dedicated his life to peace, preserving WWII warbirds, and helping other Veterans to recover from war related behavioral health injuries. He is the Greatest Generation.",1467072000,3,289,5.444444444444445
8735631,5,B01648P9FC,"I watch and read whatever about Iwo for history sake and since my Father watched the flag from 100yrds away being raised.  I work at an airport and  recognized Capt Jerry Yellin, also a Marine, who you will see in this great DVD. We had about 15-20minutes to talk before his departure.  Super nice man.... shared a couple of great stories....  PBS does a remarkable job on all there productions.",1466812800,2,395,4.6
8735632,5,B01648P9FC,"This is a very powerful movie. I had an uncle who fought on Iwo Jima, and I'm not sure he ever could have reconciled his feelings for the Japanese. The men on both sides who participated in this reunion had remarkable lives and then, last spring, an opportunity to put a new meaning to their experiences there.",1449014400,3,310,4.456140350877193
