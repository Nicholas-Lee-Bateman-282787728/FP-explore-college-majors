8495994,1,B006B9XYV6,"This so called ""exhaustive"" study of Stalingrad offered very little for me. I found that most of the stock footage and interviews with the participants gave me little insight into the battle for the city itself. I would prefer a much longer study engaging in the logistics of the battle, rather than the rather stock opinions given by the consultants.

Everyone seemed to have a tendency to simply blame one person or the other. What I fail to understand is how this can occur. Certainly, there was more than one staff officer present either in Germany or Stalingrad who would offer us more insight into the battle both before the encirclement and after. Was the entire German General Staff out to lunch that day? Did they stay at lunch the entire week 3 months before and after the battle?

You can't hide a million men. While the Soviets did a good job of disguising their formations, I can't believe that this study failed to discuss any aspect of logistics, intelligence or operations.",1408665600,,989,4.744186046511628
8495995,5,B006B9XYV6,"This review is from: Stalingrad (DVD)
On my DVD I don't have any dubbing or the like, I just got the facts. As someone who is huge on history and served for many years and though I understood how the Germans lost, I was very wrong. I won't give it away how the Soviet's were able to win against a far better trained and equipped army, however I will state that when you find out you will be amazed. I was and I fought in a lot of battles since 1970. I used this film to teach commanders. To wet your whisper I will give you one bite: In winter guns need to be oiled more often. This prevents freeze up and it allows for a better speed and accurate shooting. The Germans used the standard oil that all armies of that era used with one exception, Soviet soldiers did it a different way. They added gasoline to the oil. What this did was the same as The Germans only that it also allow the Soviets to fire 2 bullets to Germans one and they were more accurate. There is more to learn. The movie uses excellent film from the battle for the foremost and it moves along. It is over before you know and my reaction was wow, that was a great film, I learned and wanting more. The length was the bad part to me.",1389571200,,1201,4.071729957805907
