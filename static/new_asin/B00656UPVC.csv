8493301,5,B00656UPVC,"Continuing its precedent set down by volume 1, the OVA moves along at a brisk pace and lands us in the Qlipoth and explains everything quite succintly so that viewers who never even played the game can understand the complex nature of the world these characters live in and how the overall dynamics of the world function. We finally start to see a massive change in Luke and the cutting of his hair signifies that change outwardly as he struggles to decide who he wants to be. A great start to a character arc that will be fulfilled in the end.",1370908800,,544,4.396039603960396
