8114405,3,B000EUHEHS,"All About Kayaking is a video meant for beginners.  First the good news:

The section on clothing is excellent, though it is more than the beginner needs to know unless she is attempting a circumnavigation of Greenland.

The section on kayak selection is also very good with lots of information.  However, the video appears to show the same kayak when talking about several variants on white-water kayaks.

Now the bad news:  As has been pointed out, there are ads for other dvds by the same company.  At the end of the video, there are even excerpts from some of these videos which don't really add to the stuff beginners need to know.  This is not objectionable on the first viewing, but you'll be yelling at the TV after you've watched it a few times.

Some things are covered very lightly, like how to get into a kayak.  This is a matter of seconds on the dvd, with little explanation given.  The first time I attempted to get into a touring kayak I ended up in the drink.  Fortunately, no one was watching.  Getting on a sit-on-top is easy, but more advanced kayaks are not so easy and the dvd should have explained the technique.

Some things are not covered at all.  For example, while demonstrating a wet exit, the person in the dvd bangs the hull of his kayak three times (to get the attention of paddlers near you).  There is no mention of this in the narration.

There are a number of paddlers shown in the dvd using TERRIBLE technique!  Their hands are way too close together, and they are paddling by arm power alone.  In a beginner's video, you want to only see people doing things the right way to help burn that image in your mind.  Its called visualization, and you can quote me.

There is too much information about kayak fishing, surfing a kayak, etc.  The video is entitled ""All About Kayaking"" so I guess some inclusion of these topics is fair.  BUT the entire video is around 50 minutes long!  Better to spend more time on other topics.

Finally, I suggest to you that ""Recreational Kayaking: Essential Skills and Safety"" by Ken Whiting (available here at Amazon) is a better all around choice.  Here's the link:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Recreational-Kayaking-DVD-The-Essential-Skills-and-Safety/dp/B000Q6GWYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Recreational Kayaking DVD - The Essential Skills and Safety</a>",1313971200,2,2372,4.987244897959184
8114406,2,B000EUHEHS,"A better and more honest description would have been ""An Introduction to Kayaking.""

The DVD introduces you to the different types of kayaks & kayaking along with accessories like paddles & safety gear, but doesn't even show how to do something as elemental as rolling a kayak upright.  If this is supposed to cover everything about kayaking, it's interesting that they advertise a whole series of DVDs on aspects of kayaking at the end.  I didn't appreciate the misrepresentation of this DVD, and would have looked elsewhere for information had I known it was so elementary.  It is an expensive advertisement for their other kayaking DVD's.",1203033600,18,641,5.018867924528302
8114407,5,B000EUHEHS,This is a very helpful resource for beginners and a nice review for those looking to compare types of paddling or considering different boats.,1190332800,12,142,4.958333333333333
