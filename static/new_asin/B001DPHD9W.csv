 how Aria is on & off screen. I really hope they continue to make MORE Roxie Hunter movies even if they have to transition her from preteen/kid to teen; she is aces in our book!",1277078400,4,335,4.075757575757576
3535982,3,B001DPHD9W,"My daughter is 9 and LOOOOVES mermaids. I bought the movie hoping it would have lots of mermaid scenes in it. Sadly, it doesn't. The movie itself is okay and entertaining, but would be dissapointing to a little girl hoping to see lots of mermaid action. I recommend ""Fish Tales"", which I also bought. Lots of mermaid scenes in it! ;)",1269907200,5,333,4.475409836065574

8294499,5,B001DPHD9W,"Really, really cute story. I love the unreal world where cops are so ""nice"" that they let a little girl decide what to do with an amnesiac woman who wondered into town all wet. And Roxy is hilariously confident that she really does know enough in life to make such decisions. I'll take any fantasy story, even a kids' show, if it's made well. But these add an element of almost 'perfect' world to the mix. Except for the bad guys, but on the other hand, they're ridiculous enough to keep that world safe in spite of themselves.
And by the way, the girl who played Roxy, (a woman now), what a beautiful singing voice! You can find her on Youtube. I hope she pursues that career.",1498435200,,677,4.338582677165355
