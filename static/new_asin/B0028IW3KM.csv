8597848,5,B0028IW3KM,"I own a dozen videos on elk hunting and calling.  This the best elk video I have because the host Tom Sprezze knows his elk habitat and how to recognize it.  I have watched it many times and hunted Colorado, then watched again and realized something new that I didn't get before.  This happens every time I watch it.  I only wish I had it on DVD, that would be forever as my VCR is just about shot.",1522886400,,398,4.064102564102564
8597849,5,B0028IW3KM,"The host of Elusive in the Wild, Tom Spezze, spent 31 years as a Wildlife Officer for the CO Division of Wildlife, one of the nation's leading State agencies in wildlife management. CO is home to the largest number of Rocky Mountain Elk in the world and Tom Spezze is one of the foremost experts in wildlife conservation, RM Elk habitat, elk habits and characteristics, zoology of RM Elk, and of course Hunting RM Elk.  I know Tom personally and he was a Wildlife Manager/Officer in the Gunnison Basin of west/central Colorado known for an abundance of RM Elk and one of the epicenters of RM Elk Hunting opportunities in the world.  Around the time 'Elusive in the Wild' was filmed, Tom had won and was the first ever recipient of the CO Div. of Wildlife's coveted 'John D. Hart Officer of the Year Award'.  Only the ""Legends"" in CO DOW's wildlife conservation and management and Wildlife Law Enforcement receive this award (the true experts and 'legends' in the field)and are selected as recipients for the award by their peers within the CO DOW.  Unfortunately not long after Tom dedicated much of his time and shared a fraction of his expertise and ""tricks"" of recognizing ideal elk habitat, tracking them, learning their migration patterns, and the fair stalk and harvesting of RM Elk, the producer of this educational video unlawfully and unethically cut Tom out of any deal for receiving any concessions from the sale and distribution of this video.  He pretended to be his friend and business associate and then cut him out, ""stabbed him in the back"", and moved from the town of Gunnison without a word. Being the bigger man he is, Tom did not seek legal counsel and continued to focus his energies toward improving, stabilizing, and managing the resources of Colorado while educating his Public constituents on the importance and benefits of wildlife conservation, with hunting as a key tool in conserving wildlife for now and future generations of not just Coloradans, but all Americans who travel to CO to hunt the majestic RM Elk.  This is an older (late 1980's or early 1990's), but the knowledge has gone unchanged, and is ALL within this video.  I give this video an A+++ or a '10 out of 10', not for the production of the video, but SOLELY for the presentation by Tom of information passed along to any generation on the topic of everything pertaining to Rocky Mountain Elk, and can all be learned in this video, 'ELUSIVE IN THE WILD'.",1382572800,,2450,4.737089201877934
