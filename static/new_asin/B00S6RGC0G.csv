8697456,1,B00S6RGC0G,This item presented itself as being helpful for younger children such as infants and toddlers but what I actually received was for more older and developed kids. This is not what I thought I was ordering and I have spent time with smaller children and know what is suitable for them and this wasn't it,1501459200,,301,4.490909090909091
8697457,5,B00S6RGC0G,My 1st grader kids lover this since I started usong/showing Baby signing time of this series when they were 1/2yrs old.  They really enjoy watching this as cont.  of what they know.,1497830400,,181,4.625
8697458,5,B00S6RGC0G,"I learned S.E.E. (signing exact english) in high school, and picked up A.S.L. (American Sign Language) while interpreting at my church in California. I bought these to help teach my kids, and we LOVE them! Buying them at Amazon was a bit LESS expensive than buying from the actual website, but I'm sure the $ is going to the right place. Our kids ask to watch them everyday, and our 2 year old daughter uses every sign she learns. My four year old just thinks they're fun to watch, but I'm sure he's picking it up too.",1494201600,,518,4.350515463917525

8697460,1,B00S6RGC0G,"This set was repetitive of the first series. I learned more in the first series, which was faster paced and more comprehensive in content and song creativity. My 2 year old would agree, as she wanted nothing to with any of these discs.",1488067200,3,235,4.488372093023256
