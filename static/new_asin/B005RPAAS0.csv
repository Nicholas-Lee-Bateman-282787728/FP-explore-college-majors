8484320,1,B005RPAAS0,"As sold from LateBloomer, this DVD (can't even be called that) is HORRIBLE quality. I have seen VCDs of better quality. It has the aspect ratio of a cell phone and is the most horrible bootlegged copy I have ever seen. It looks like it was recorded off television onto a VHS and then digitized.",1386547200,4,294,4.363636363636363
