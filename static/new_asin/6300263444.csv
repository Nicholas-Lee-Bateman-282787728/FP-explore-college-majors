290125,5,6300263444,"Nice little monster movie with a cool plot. Somewhat cheese, but what you except from a 80's monster flick! It takes itself more seriously than most monster movies from this time period. It's about a guy who finds out he has a sibling.....but the brother is NOT human...yeah, and my bro isn't human either. He's from Jupiter. LOL.",1185408000,,330,4.706896551724138
290126,3,6300263444,"The Kindred is not the greatest horror movie ever but it's certainly not a bad one either.
 Rod Steiger(Dr. Phillip Lloyd) and Kim Hunter(Dr. Amanda Hollins) star in a movie about a genetic experiment gone completely wrong. Dr. Hollins is a molecular biologist, who in poor health, confides in her son John to destroy all of her experiments and ""The Anthony"" journals. John wants to know who Anthony is and is told that it's his brother. Anthony is a half-human/sea creature that lives in the basement and was created by Dr. Hollins from her natural son's living tissue.
 The movie starts out a bit slow but picks up the pace through the middle and has a good climax. The acting isn't the best but the story is interesting and there are some pretty good scenes. All and all The Kindred isn't bad but I'd rent it before you buy it.",1043107200,5,830,4.526666666666666
290127,3,6300263444,"This is a very good and groteusque horror movie about a scientist that gets a sample of her sons blood and creates a monster named ""Anthony"", A silmy muntant monster that attacks a bunch of scientists that try to finish Her work after she dies. We get tons of slime, a variety of monsters, and good acting. The story is excelent and avoids traps that some B-movies get into such as un-nessacary nudity and no plot. The ending also makes you wonder  What happens next? ( If you see it, you will no what I mean.) Worth a rent and if you Are a monster fan, you will probally want to own it. Rated R for profanity and lot and lots of slime.",1037404800,3,636,4.170731707317073
7808055,5,6300263444,"Storywise, this is a two tiered tale. The first dealing with Rod Steiger as a (very) mad scientist who is performing unholy genetic experiments with humans who have been kidnapped from automobile accidents, turning them into mad half-people half-something else (watch the movie and find out what). Meanwhile, John is a young doctor who is informed by his girlfriend that his mother has just come out of a three year coma after a heart attack.

Unfortunately, she is also a mad scientist, but, now that she's conscious, she wants her son to go out to her house and destroy all her research and notes. Steiger, of course, takes umbrage to this, and wants to put the skids on this destruction. To help him, he plants Melissa, who is a spy, in John's camp.

John takes Melissa, his girlfriend, and some friends up to his mom's house, and it is here that strange things start happening, including a dog's bloody death and a woman being attacked by a creature possessed watermelon (!), and the pacing starts to pick up from there to a truly exciting climax.

 This is just an old-fashioned monster romp, full of icky monsters, monster attacks, mad scientists, mad scientist's experiments, people running amok in panic, cute babes, and a solid pacing. There's suspense and humor, although this film never devolves into comedy. The special effects are totally icky, but in a fun way. The story is full of plotholes to be sure, something that comes from a script that was written by five people (!), including Stephen Carpenter (who created Grimm), Joseph Stefano (Psycho), and Earl Ghaffari (music editor for such movies as Frozen, Zootopia, and Wreck-It Ralph). But it also moves at a quick pace, and all seem to be having a wacky fun time making it. Including the cast, which includes such journeymen actors like Kim Hunter, Rod Steiger, who just chews up the scenery, Talia Balsam, Peter Frechette (Profiler), and the yummy Amanda Pays (Max Headroom, and both versions of The Flash) as the subversive, but sympathetic, Melissa.

The best way to describe this movie is as if Frankenstein and The Island of Doctor Moreau were written by H. P. Lovecraft and filmed by a less coked out Stuart Gordon. No nudity, no real gore, good make-up, old-fashioned practical effects, so it's fun for everybody and don't forget to bring the kids.",1503705600,,2325,4.831658291457287

7808062,5,6300263444,"Before I get into the review, I would just like to say a couple things: I grew up watching horror movies that used prosthetics, rubber suits and such for the special effects, and in my opinion, it still beats out the non-realistic looking CGI effects. The problem with horror movies of today is that the effects that they use CGI for make it look extremely impossible for something from a movie scene to happen in real, but with use of prosthetics and such, it makes it look like its actually happening because the prosthetic piece is really attached to the actor which makes it look real unlike CGI where you put someone in front of a green screen and then add a couple backgrounds and special effects that look nothing like real life, more cartoonish per-say.

Anyways, I remember watching this on VHS when I was a little kid back in the early 90's and it really creeped me out. Sure, if you go by today's standards with all of the new CGI effects and technology, this movie would be considered cheesy and laughable to most, but regardless, it is still a very good movie. This was one of the very first movies (Besides Nightmare On Elm Street) that introduced me to the horror genre of movies.

Bottom line: A very good film. Awesome creature effects in this movie, especially the fish transformation scene. If you're a huge fan of 80's horror movies or like Creature/Monster movies, give this one a try. This film definetly deserves a DVD release.",1358812800,4,1450,4.594594594594595
7808063,4,6300263444,"I loved this movie since childhood, back when it mildly unnerved me around age 11.  Classically simple story, good deaths, a cool monster and serviceable effects leave this movie dying for a worthy DVD release.  Very satisfying 80s horror!  Every bit as good as I remember from 20 years ago.

  * * * * * * * * * * * *

John's geneticist mom (Kim Hunter; The Planet of the Apes movies) is on her death bed and demands that he go to her cabin and ""burn the Anthony journals"" and all of her research to ""end the experiment"" because ""who knows what he will become.""  Who is Anthony?  His brother!?!

John (David Allen Brooks) is also a researcher doing something with ""rogue proteins called prions.""  He works in the same building as his mother and Dr. Lloyd.  He seeks Dr. Lloyd's advice about ""Anthony,"" probably a mistake, and mentions cleaning up his mother's experiments.  Dr. Lloyd is suspiciously interested...dun dun dunnnnnn.  Then Dr. Lloyd confronts mom.  He's a bad guy who wants to finish her experiments, which he has just discovered to exist.

Dr. Lloyd (Rod Steiger) conducts weird experiments on skinless cats and gets other subjects (i.e., human brains) by shady means.  We find that his work results in the creation of ugly, slimy, blistery-oozy skinned mutants that happen to love to eat fresh, screaming human flesh.  The nasty gore effort is clearly already evident in the first 15 minutes.  Sadly, for whatever reason, we never see Dr. Lloyd's mutants again.

Yet another molecular biologist/geneticist Melissa (Amanda Pays) was always inspired by John's mom's work and joins John to the cabin after meeting him at her funeral.  She claims to be his mother's biggest fan--because geneticists are known for the loyal fanbase.  She and John really hit it off, so well that you wouldn't know John had a girlfriend.  Melissa turns out to be saucy trouble and she comes with her own intriguing secrets.

The house is nothing special.  His old bedroom has been transformed into an elaborate Frankensteinian alchemy lab and he finds some old recordings (a la Evil Dead).  His dog encounters a weird tentacle thing that is prehensile--poor dog.  This long, thin tentacle evidently probes for food.  The monster uses these tentacles to evidently impregnate a watermelon with a mass of slimy tentacles which later hatches and attacks one of John's colleagues in her car by going all Evil Dead tree-rape-y on her; restraining her limbs and body and plunging tentacles into her orifices, down her throat and under her skin.  This little, slimy squid monster reminds me of the tentacular assault from Species.

So who's Anthony?  We learn that Anthony is a ""hybrid"" of some sort, spliced with marine fish DNA.  It turns out mom had a lot of this little critters.  Anthony is awesomely ugly and we get to see quite a bit of him and his squidling little brothers.  There is also a ""bonus creature"" with a nifty transformation scene. The death scene at the end comes with a grossly clever revelation and disgusts much as does Slither.  There's also an appropriate surprise at the end, which is action-packed as horror goes.

Very satisfying 80s horror.  Every bit as good as I remember from 20 years ago.",1352505600,4,3208,4.809523809523809
