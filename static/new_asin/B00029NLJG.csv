8024597,4,B00029NLJG,"I purchased this movie as an upgrade for my sister.
I have seen it several times and although it is a bit
slow, (it is dialogue driven) it is a look @ relationships
that is funny and honest.
Well done.",1357689600,3,201,4.05
8024598,3,B00029NLJG,"I'm always confused when it comes to movies like this.  It's supposed to be a chick flick of some sorts with a romantic theme, but there's always some surprising vulgar segments, and I honestly don't understand why.  My guess is that it's a cheap attempt to get male viewers to enjoy these kind of films by including intense swear words and extreme adult themes.  Honestly, guys and girls should never *ever* talk to each other in reality the way they do in this film concerning adult subjects.  It's sickening to me.  I understand it's just a comedy film, but geez, I still don't like it, and it's misleading to those who just want to sit down and watch a nice romantic comedy.

With that out of the way, the movie has other problems too.  The first 15 minutes of the film did an absolutely terrible job building up character development.  It was so bad in fact, that I almost turned it off.  I stuck with it though.

I do think the story eventually gets better but you really have to be extremely patient.  Still, there's movies a lot better than this, no doubt about it.  What it comes down to is yet another movie where someones friend sleeps with their boyfriend, etc, etc.  You know what to expect.  In the end, it had some nice moments that made me laugh a little bit, so that's enough to give the movie a decent rating.",1246320000,,1327,4.407407407407407
8024599,5,B00029NLJG,"I love this movie, even though it's not some million dollar budget film. Just a great movie with some semi-big name stars. Love ittttt.",1241222400,2,135,4.666666666666667
8024600,2,B00029NLJG,"This, a tale of four 20-something women seeking love, held a lot of promise based on the cast, but never delivered. The dialogue was stiff and poorly delivered. The  main players are : Claire (Marissa Ribisi)- the ""desperate to fall in love flake, April (Juliette Lewis)- the drunk who sleeps with every guy she meets, Neal- (Michael Rapaport) April's pathetic cuckolded ""boyfriend"", and Jason (Giovanni Ribisi)- Claire's pathetic nerd brother. All actors and actresses I normally enjoy, but in this case none managed to deliver a performance worthy of note. Definitely a film I would not recommend to anyone other than a diehard fan of one the principal players.",1178755200,2,663,5.08256880733945
8024601,4,B00029NLJG,"I enjoyed this movie because it makes you laugh and it makes you angry due to the behavior of the 20 somethings in the movie and toying with peoples trust and affections as well happens so much in today's society.  No wonder so many people are turning to the same sex when these games are played.  I do recommend this movie, it has party scenes, male players and female players that use and abuse other peoples affections, not for the emotionally squeemish.",1168732800,3,457,4.560975609756097
8024602,5,B00029NLJG,"I picked up this DVD in a bargain bin for like $5.99 because I like the actors in it and the cover of dvd. I'm glad I did an entertaining film I call it the Cameron Crowe's movie ""Singles"" of LA without the grunge. A group of emotionally driven twenty somethings in LA in the 90's. Claire (Marissa Ribisi) is trying to find a decent man anwhere she can after having her heart broken several times. Her best friend April(Juliette Lewis) having sex with any man she can find while stringing Neil(M.Rapaport) along who is completely in love with her. My favorite character is Giovanni Ribisi who plays Jason Claire's eccentric brother due to his awkward bluntness has a hard time finding girls but is totally in love with the jaded older Jenn. His dialogue is cleverly genuis. Claire finally thinks she found the man of her dreams falling for an aspiring actor Chad (Jeremy Sisto) but finds out he really is an actor with the ladies & is a liar. The ending is outragously funny. A unique script and amazing acting by pretty much the whole cast. Entertaining movie about people in their 20's dealing with the hardships of relationships & love.",1091404800,12,1139,4.615763546798029
