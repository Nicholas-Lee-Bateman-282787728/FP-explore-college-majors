8299406,4,B001ERBK20,"I think this set is overpriced considering the quality of the movies and discs.  The discs are the type one uses at home and thus are more easily scratched. Scared Stiff was so dark in the basement chase scene one couldn`t see what was happening.  I have the Alpha version which showed more clearly what was happening, but it was less desirable otherwise. The trailer for Detour was disappointing in that it was inserted in a still picture and not full size. The set would have been great if the quality were better and the price lower.",1275696000,,536,4.515463917525773
