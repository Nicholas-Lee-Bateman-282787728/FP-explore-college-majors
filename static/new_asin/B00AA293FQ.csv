5402032,4,B00AA293FQ,"The Gentle Bear Man of Emo isn't exactly a Timothy Treadwell.  This is an interesting and informative film.
There are also some quite emotional moments throughout the movie.  The photography isn't perfect, but
that doesn't distract from the film's content.  A very good family film.",1376611200,,282,5.222222222222222
5402033,5,B00AA293FQ,I loved this movie...I live in New Jersey and we do have bears here in our yard....the movie made me think of the bears in a whole new light...I just love the way Michael and his wife interact with them...I wish I lived closer it made me want to visit their sanctuary....this is a wonderful family movie.,1366243200,,304,4.350877192982456
5402034,1,B00AA293FQ,It was slow moving and repeated the same theme as well as scene over and over again. I was really excited about getting this. Is there any way I can sell it back to you?,1362873600,,169,3.857142857142857
5402035,5,B00AA293FQ,"This story of kindness, of connection to nature, and of the healing of a broken spirit in such a wondrous and unexpected manner, moved me to tears.  The gentle man, who feeds and cares for the animals in this film, is so unusual, and shares his heart clearly. Although you may question the actions,  you can't help but wonder about what is happening, both to the man and the beasts he loves so dearly.",1357603200,3,401,4.405405405405405
5402036,4,B00AA293FQ,"I started this video thinking it was a story about a man who gets too close to bears and lives to tell about it. That much is true, but it goes beyond that and tells a bigger story of a man who finds wholeness where many would have given up. His life is pretty amazing. There are segments that go a bit too long, but the story, cinematography and music more than make up for it. Another purposeful and well done production from Steve Greisen.",1356652800,,442,4.211764705882353
5402037,5,B00AA293FQ,"I was grateful to receive an advanced copy of this film! It's a captivating story about a man's restoration of hope in the human spirit through a profound connection with bears and other wildlife. Michael Scheibler tells his own life journey of traumatic loss, abuse, rage and ultimately hopelessness in humanity. In a moment of deep anger he cries out ""Why is there no love? Where is it?"" The answer to Mr. Scheibler's painful cry blossoms through a miraculous and continuous love story that takes place each day in Scheibler's Isaiah XI Wildlife Refuge.  Every bear, raccoon, and bird that finds its way to Mr. Scheibler has its own story, paralleling pain and brokenness; Isaiah XI is an intersection where darkness meets freedom and healing for both animal and man. What takes place here can only be attributed to unconditional and divine love.

This is a heart wrenching and spirit lifting documentary of an incredible journey of a man and his bears. For my husband and me, we were deeply moved and awestruck; for my children, they were intrigued and entertained. The extraordinary story, the beautiful musical score, and the outstanding cinematography combine together to create a five star experience for the entire family!",1355788800,2,1230,5.0245098039215685
5402038,5,B00AA293FQ,"This movie is awesome and a must see for all ages!! This film is a wonderful story about man with a troubled life that finds more than just love for his animals.
I was completely moved by this movie and it is a must have for any fine movie collection!!",1354752000,,252,4.06
5402039,5,B00AA293FQ,"Why don't we see more documentaries like this on TV? This is an amazing, true story that is beautifully produced...with a touching, redemptive ending that will fill your heart with hope. Bravo to producer Steve Greisen. Please give us more!",1354579200,,240,5.025
5402040,5,B00AA293FQ,"I was invited to an advanced premier and I was expecting a reality television themed nature documentary that we've all seen over and over again, but I was overwhelmed with the heart, humanity, and somewhat scary proximity of very large bears I was presented with!  Not only is the story a welcome change from the bland cardboard cut-out recipe we're all a little tired of, it's a REAL story about a REAL person who interacts with the world around him in an unbelievable way.

The music is beautiful, the story is touching, and I loved it!",1354060800,,538,4.59375

8548878,5,B00AA293FQ,"This is certainly an amazing story, and one I hope that other's will agree.  The situation's that take place seem far fetched, but the ""prof is in the pudding"".  This is a film that would be one that people of all ages will appreciate.",1433116800,,235,4.318181818181818
8548879,2,B00AA293FQ,"I enjoyed the storey of this man's life and his transformation.  And I love wildlife and appreciate anyone that dedicates their lives to saving them. But, the acts of feeding bears and other wildlife does not save their lives. It is harmful and feeding them in natural foods is also harmful.  I mean, really, donuts, cookies, cake, and bread!!  What happens when he is no longer around to continue feeding them, where  are these bears going to find their fatty foods they have become to rely on?  They are far too comfortable around people. I find it crazy that others are fined or even sent to prison for less.",1419724800,,611,4.568807339449541
8548880,5,B00AA293FQ,"Very soon all the earth human and animal will reside in peace together.  God's original purpose for all the earth to be a Paradise has not changed.  Any who pray the ""Lord's Prayer""; pray for this to occur with the words ""Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven"".",1418947200,,270,4.173076923076923
8548881,2,B00AA293FQ,"This man is a whacko who is not at all helping the adult bears he feeds.  One telling example:  he claims a mother bear actually abandoned her two cubs to him so he could do the work of feeding them instead of her.  OMG!  THAT's not a positive!

The diet he feeds them is shameful:  he feeds pregnant female bears chocolate cake ""to improve lactation""?  What an idiot.  And clearly he has not gotten over his self-professed hatred of people:  for example, I do not think his slogan that at his place, ""People are caged while the Wildlife roam free"" was funny, appropriate or ""biblical.""

Don't show this film to your children.  Children don't need to hear about how this celluloid-created ""hero"" spent his childhood plotting to murder his parents, or how his original intention when he bought his land was to turn pristine Canadian wilderness into a golf course and motocross speedway.  ARF!  He thinks his wildlife preserve is fulfilling biblical prophecy, but he has spent his life hating religion and people, and has no idea what God loves and prioritizes.

It is a sad commentary on humanity that someone funded the filming of a documentary about this man.

P.S.  My 13 year old son just read this review over my shoulder and commented, ""Instead of funding this documentary they should have funded one about String Theory or some other very important science topic.  Or how about a documentary where wildlife experts explain what man's relationship to animals like bears REALLY should be?""  Yes, honey, you are absolutely correct on both points.",1407196800,,1549,4.82509505703422
8548882,3,B00AA293FQ,"I had problems with the audio going out momentarily every few seconds for the first five minutes of the video. I wasn't streaming, this was downloaded to my iPad and iPhone.

Overall, the story is pretty good and uplifting. However, I wonder if it's really a good idea to interfere with nature. What will happen when there eventually comes a time when no one is available to feed the bears who have become accustomed to heing hand fed like little children who don't know how to provide for themselves. Another concern that I have is that it appears as if the bears are being fed more processed food such as Wonder Bread, donuts, and cakes, which is not part of their natural diet. Makes you wonder what kind if health problems the bears will suffer from such a poor diet.

But, overall, it's a fairly good storyline with a man's incredible relationship with bears and other wildlife.",1391731200,5,883,4.617834394904459
8548883,4,B00AA293FQ,I enjoyed watching this man interact withe bears and how much he cares for them. He really has  a bond with them.,1383868800,,113,4.136363636363637
8548884,3,B00AA293FQ,"Some nice messages but not sure he's really helping the bears. I like that he helps orphans but the adults are becoming too dependent on him and the junk food he is feeding them. I wouldn't be surprised if they developed diabetes. Hope not, his intentions are good.",1377993600,2,265,4.541666666666667
