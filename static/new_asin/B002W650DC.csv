8382854,5,B002W650DC,Excellent narration and beautiful vistas of the island.  Plan to watch it several times before we visit this fall.  Gorgeous color and images.,1466380800,,142,5.130434782608695

8382856,4,B002W650DC,"Lots of information about Santorini and some nearby islands which helps to focus travel planning.  A bit dated and some of the music can overpower the narration at times, but I think it was a good introduction, especially for things that aren't likely to change.  More maps would help show distances but it helped show what the local terrain, beaches and views we'll want to visit.",1424736000,,381,4.757575757575758
8382857,1,B002W650DC,Santorini is a beautiful and geologically amazing place to visit. Yet this video provides little that would encourage you to visit. The narration is dreadfully monotone and filled with puffy words without value.,1374364800,2,211,5.424242424242424

This is my third Cities of the World disk (Sicily and Rhodes were the other two), so obviously I think enough of them to continue buying them.

On the positive side, they make every effort to be all-inclusive, at least in terms of the sights. They vary widely in terms of analysis. This one is satisfactory in that regard. The narrator discusses the volcania eruption that created modern Santorini, its connection to the Minoan civilization and Crete, and the theory that it was the basis for the Atlantis legend.

Like another reviewer, I was initially put off by his know-it-all tone, but was able to ignore it after about 5 minutes. The ""cheerful"" bouncy music is also an irritant.

Virtually all of the shots are external; they never seem to enter buildings such as churches.

That said, I don't know of any acceptable alternative, especially when dealing with some of the less popular tourist destinations.

NOTE: This disk was produced in 2002, and may be outdated.

UPDATE (03/01/2012): The Teaching Company has just released a superb DVD, ""The Great Tours: Greece and Turkey, from Athens to Istanbul"" by Professor John R. Hale of the University of Louisville that features a half-hour programs on Santorini that is as good as they come. Although the list price is $255, their programs are regularly sold at 70% off, i.e., $69.95. If you're going to that part of the world, and especially if you're visiting several different islands, buy that program.",1328659200,2,1461,4.870967741935484
8382859,3,B002W650DC,"So sorry the other reviewer could not work his DVD.  I took a chance hoping to get lucky and i did.  The scenery and photography is beautiful.  There is just enough information to leave you wanting a bit more, not enough to bore you.  I think it gives well rounded information to help the first time Santorini visitor plan her day or two, with an easy to navigate menu.
On the down side, the narrator has an annoying know-it-all tone and the music is non-stop irritating.",1284163200,,471,4.441860465116279
8382860,1,B002W650DC,"Advertized as region ""0"" - put it in my Toshiba DVD player about half a dozen times - 5 times got ""Check disc"" error code; once, with multiple pushes on PLAY button got it to play partway through the program but it kept pausing/stopping, and I would have to press fast forward or play many times to keep it moving.  Cleaning the DVD did not improve performance,  and on repeat tries it won't get past the initial ""check disc"" error message. Perhaps it is a problem with my DVD player but all the other DVDs in my collection incl. a few region 0 play fine (except for a Mykonos from same company - similar problems). An email to the company 4 days ago asking for suggestions has not been returned yet.  If someone else has purchased this item and has had no problems with it, please post your review so that the product will not be unfairly avoided.",1275523200,,848,4.3544303797468356
