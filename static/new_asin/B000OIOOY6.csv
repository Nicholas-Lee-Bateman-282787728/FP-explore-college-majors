8185104,1,B000OIOOY6,"Poor, boring, undocumented, has no music excerpts. To be fled at all costs. Tell your friends to stay away. Trust me. I love the Dixie Chicks and this is deserves the waste basket.",1349222400,3,180,4.484848484848484

8185106,1,B000OIOOY6,This DVD is horrible.  Mind you I could not get passed the first 10 minutes of the DVD.  All of the footage on this DVD is video footage compiled from other DVD and interviews already published.  There is no new material.  All this DVD includes is clips of previously recorded interviews and comments made by the Dixie Chicks that we have already seen and heard.  It is also the worst attempt at putting together a documentary.  It is definitely unauthorized.  No one in their right mind would authorize this DVD.,1198972800,30,513,4.633333333333334
