I love it.",1253059200,,246,4.613636363636363
2998633,4,B000X623UQ,Cathe never disappoints me & so goes with my recent purchase of 4 Day split. I love the ability to workout thoroughly with cardio & weights- I can only workout 4 times a week due to my schedule & these dvds deliver. I have already seen fitness gains & am ready for my Aruba trip next month. These dvds have her infamous workout premixes that allow you to customize your workouts in a different way.  These have a total of 22 premixes plus the 4 workouts in their entirety- great purchase & recommend them highly.,1241049600,2,512,4.389473684210526
2998634,4,B000X623UQ,"Overall a great workout.  I have love Cathe videos because they are not boring, and also because I really get my heart working.  The two step workouts are her signature great step workouts.  They are interesting and keep me going.  Both the high and low intensity took me a few times to fully learn the steps but I do enjoy them.  The boot camp section is a tough workout but, like a typical bootcamp video, is repetitious and easy to follow- so my five year old son enjoys doing this one with me.  The kick box workout is similar to her other kick box workouts.  I like kick box which is what brought me to Cathe for a veriety of kickbox workouts, but i have really learned to prefer her step workouts so on any given day it is likely that I will prefer to do her step workouts.  However, it is also nice ot have the kickbox and the bootcamp options on this video to mix things up too.",1232928000,2,886,4.170588235294118
2998635,3,B000X623UQ,"i own about 15 cathe workouts. this is the only one i have ever been disappointed in. i hardly ever use it, because its just not up to cathe's standard.",1231804800,,152,4.1
2998636,5,B000X623UQ,"I have been working out with Cathe for years and couldn't wait to get this one. I was not dissappointed. I actually like it better than her last series (drill max, body max 2, etc.). All in all it's a little less challenging than some of her older workouts, but enough to get my heart rate up and feel worked out. However, if you're a beginner, or have never done a Cathe workout, this is not for you. There are so many premixes that you can vary your workouts for probably a month. The low intensity section reminded me of Christi Taylor, but less complex. The Kickbox section is much easier than Kick Max. I thought her cuing was well done, I had no problem following it the first time through. The weight section allows you to choose really heavy weights which I love. The time goes by fast and the premixes allow for longer and also shorter workouts.",1205712000,6,854,4.377358490566038
2998637,5,B000X623UQ,"I bought this DVD workout for those days I just don't have 90 minutes to two hours to workout or at least don't feel up to my usual 2 plus hour workout sessions.

This workout comes on 2 DVD's, each DVD has its own mix of those two workouts that are on that particular one.  The mixes alone are worth it in my opinion. Also, there are Chapters for each workout on the two DVD's so if the workout you chose doesn't have abs you can go to the workout that has it select just that chapter and add it afterwards as a separate thing.  Because of the fabulous mixes per DVD you can really choose what kind of workout and time limits you want.

The choreagraphy is great as always with Cathe and the music is always awesome. I really like how this particular Cathe workout DVD focuses on working specific areas with weights and the next workout focuses on different ones so you don't overwork or injure yourself.  I really like this workout its always fun and the time just flies by as with all her workouts.  This particular one is designed to give you a balanced workout in about an hour.  There is a good mix of workouts on it.

Disc 1

Higher Intensity Step Plus Heavy Weights Chest/Back = 59 min
Lower Intensity Step Plus Heavy Weights Shoulders,Core,and Calves= 66 min

Chapters for each workout Plus Mixes for maximum versatility!

Disc 2

Boot Camp Plus Heavy Weights Biceps and Triceps = 62 min
Kick Box Plus Heavy Weights Legs and Core= 71 Min

Chapters for each workout Plus Mixes for maximum versatility!

I've done the Lower Intensity Step and Kickbox workouts in their entirety on discs one and two. I found these workouts to be very fun, fast, and compacting a great workout into less time than Cathe's other DVD's.  This perfect to add to your fitness library for variety. If you want an intense workout that hits all the major things in about an hour then this is the workout for you.  Its excuse proof!  Great workouts and I'm happy that I bought this one to add to my fitness library.",1203120000,21,1996,4.409836065573771
2998638,4,B000X623UQ,"This is definitely an advanced workout, and if you are looking for a challenge then you will probably like this DVD. I have been working out for years though, and I struggled through some of it. There are two step sections low intensity and high intensity. I previewed the high intensity, and decided that being as uncoordinated as I am, that I would try the low intensity step segment. I didn't get too far into it, because again you have to be pretty coordinated. Cathe does suggest that you watch each segment at least once before actually doing the segments, so you can catch on easier. The boot camp section is also more advanced and high intensity. There is a lot of running, and the best comparison I can make is if you have ever been involved in sports and done running and jumping drills. You will need extra room for this segment. The kickbox section is also high intensity, but the moves are pretty easy to follow, although some will require balance. You will burn lots of calories on this one. The four cardio segments are about 30 minutes each.

As far as the free weight sections, it can be advanced too. Cathe does a section called ""around the clock push ups"", where you do push ups as you go around in a full circle. Yikes, I didn't even try that one.! Overall though, the free weight sections will definitely give you a burn and build muscle. The only thing that bugged me about the free weight sections, were the amount of time Cathe spends getting weights and putting them back.

The segments are broken up into four days and are about an hour long for each:

Day one- lower intensity step, shoulders, calves and core

Day two- Higher intensity step, chest and back

Day three- boot camp, tricep and bicep

Day four-kickbox, legs and core

You can also mix any of these as you wish.

So, overall this is a great workout. Who wouldn't want to be able to workout like Cathe on a daily basis, that is why it is a pretty motivating DVD. Just be prepared for the challenge!",1201132800,18,1987,4.454545454545454

8226982,5,B000X623UQ,"I have been using Cathe workouts for more than 8 years and Love each one she comes out with. This dvd is short enough where my body doesn't freak out when I do the entire thing, yet long enough where I'm able to see results without killing myself doing it.",1379203200,,256,4.14
8226983,5,B000X623UQ,I love this DVD set.  Cathe's DVDs always offer a lot of different options for switching up your regular workout.  This DVD will not disappoint!,1288051200,,144,4.72
8226984,5,B000X623UQ,"I usually don't like shorter cardio and weight routines, but I do like this series.  I use the short cardio sections in this series more often than I do the weight sections.  The 30 minute cardio sections are perfect for those days when I want an energy lift, but I don't have a lot of time to work out.

The two step routines, Higher Intensity and Lower Intensity, have more complex choreography than a lot of Cathe's other step workouts.  Cathe doesn't do a lot of breakdown of the moves, which might be frustrating for some.  I happen to love complex choreography and really dislike a lot of breakdown, so this is perfect for me.

Cathe is her usual, enthusiastic and encouraging self in these workouts.

The weight workouts, while short, are intense and you can get a pretty good workout with them.  You work separate body parts each day:
**chest and back
**shoulders, core and calves
**biceps and triceps
**legs and core.

Each weight workout is preceded by a cardio workout:
**higher intensity step
**lower intensity step
**boot camp
**kickbox.

I recommend this series for anyone wanting some fun cardio and time-effective weight workouts.",1279065600,3,1146,4.8307692307692305
8226985,3,B000X623UQ,"I am the kind of person who likes to jump into a workout and catch on.  I want a challenging (NOT BORING) workout, but not something so intricate that I lose focus on getting a good workout.  So far, not a fan of the step workouts....  Kickbox and bootcamp aren't too bad.  I may like it better once I find the time to study the workout and learn the moves...  Saying this, there are several Cathe workouts I caught onto right away...  I have been doing step since I was 10 (at the YMCA with steps made out of wood!!); I am now 28.  I know a lot of moves, but some just felt awkward to me and were too hard to get into rythym with...",1269388800,3,633,3.9761904761904763
8226986,5,B000X623UQ,"This set of workouts is terrific! I have several of Cathe's other DVDs but always went for the total body workouts. I love these workouts that split body parts between workouts and use heavy weights. It has shocked my body into new shape and lost 6 lbs in the process! If you're ready for something new to shake up your routine, this set is for you! Cathe rocks!",1262822400,,362,4.338235294117647
8226987,5,B000X623UQ,"As with all of Cathe's workouts, be prepared to push yourself to the limit (and probably come up short!). Cathe's workouts are so intense, complicated and FUN! That's why I love this DVD because it's so hard and once you master it, you feel like you can do anything. The step aerobics is quite intricate and it took my viewing the DVD about 5-8 times before I felt like I had it down. I love the entire DVD and recommend it. You will definitely burn calories and feel like you really worked out. There's nothing worse than purchasing a work out DVD that's too easy or repetitive. Cathe's videos are NEVER any of those things.",1262649600,,625,4.443478260869565
8226988,5,B000X623UQ,This work-out series is simply AWESOME!!  I'm an advanced level exerciser and these DVDs are great addition to my library.  It is very engaging and the pace never stops.  The cardio is wonderfully choreographed with updates on some Oldies and will keep you wanting for more. The weight-lifting portion is nicely divided so you can work body parts at different days.  And the Premixes are an incredible bonus!  This series is all you need to get you going for a long time....,1258329600,,474,4.7317073170731705
