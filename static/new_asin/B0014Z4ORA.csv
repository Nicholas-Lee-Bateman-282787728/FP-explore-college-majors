3136403,4,B0014Z4ORA,"How She Move is a very entertaing positive film that focuses on a very intelligent and lovely young black woman, Raya. Raya leaves boarding school and goes back to her home in the projects after her sister dies. From the minute she gets back she's confronted with jealous ex-peers, two bit hustlers and a young man (Bishop) who has romantic feelings for her from back in the day.

Raya sticks to her plans to attend medical school but must overcome obstacles. These obstacles include her old nemesis/friend Michelle and Raya trying to get into Bishop's step crew. Raya's naturally talented in step but Bishop, though he's very attracted to Raya, doesn't want a female on his crew. Raya becomes determined to be on Bishop's crew after realizing she can win fifty thousand dollars at a step competition. She plans to use the money for medical school. Bishop suggests she gets on a girl's crew, namely Michelle's but Raya isn't having it. She doesn't give up and finds help in Bishop's younger brother who teaches her Bishop's routines behind his back.

Bishop finally agrees to let Raya step in his group but his ego gets the best of him when he sees she's easily the best in the crew. From that point on Raya continues to try to prove herself to those around her and ends up learning many valuable lessons. Though she hits roadblocks with Michelle and Bishop, they both help her to see that they need her as much as she needs them.

I was surprised at how good this film was. I enjoyed it because it's not the typical hip-hop movie. This is a film about a woman's journey and that woman just happens to know how to step. I think those that said the film's dances lacked something (which they didn't to me), didn't understand that the movie wasn't about the stepping. It was about Raya's life and what's she goes through. Stepping was just a tiny part of it. I thought the dancing was very good, about as good as any other step film I've seen. The actress that plays Raya is vibrant, very beautiful and brings forth a sympathetic charm that attracts you to her. The movie was realistic but you won't see any violence or sex. Maybe that's why some were disappointed. This is truly a film you can watch with your family. It's very entertaining and provides a big message about the choices we make and how we deal with them.

If have an open mind and realize that every black film doesn't have to be violent, full of sex, gang violence, involve drive-bys or have characters who or criminals and drug heads, then you will like this movie. There is NONE of that in this film. In fact the only kiss in the movie was the one between Bishop and Raya after they win the step competition. For those that expect this to be ""Boys in the Hood"" meets ""Fame"" then How She Move is definitely not for you. It's not for narrow-minded people who think that all urban films must deal with the street life and the results of it. This is a movie for people (of any race) who'd like to be entertained while learning a lesson about live, love and dreams. I definitely recommend it.",1250294400,,3055,4.489208633093525

3136405,3,B0014Z4ORA,"Like ""Flashdance,"" ""Footloose,"" ""Billy Elliot"" and any number of dance movies, ""How She Move"" is the story of a big dreamer who finds release in dance.  Unknown Rutina Wesley stars as Raya, a second-generation Jamaican from a borderline-ghetto in Toronto, Canada, who wants to become a doctor.  After drug-addiction claims her sister, Pam, and Raya's parents can no longer afford her private school tuition, Raya returns to the `hood, scraping and scheming to find her way back out, all the while resented by the locals for her ambition.  She happens upon a group of guys who practice and compete in Step-dance competitions for cash.  Step--a heady mix of rhythm-precise hip-hop, break-dancing and locking moves--is highly segregated by sex and ""How She Move"" revolves around Raya's quest to infiltrate an all-boys club and help the guys win a local competition (and, for her, much-needed money for college).  If you think you've heard of or seen a variation of this story before, then you probably have.  Still, as depicted by director Ian Rashad, Raya's neighborhood and environs are a gritty and true-to-life portrayal. While the movie strongly evokes the dead-end that awaits many poor and working-class youth with substandard education, it also telescopes the resentments engendered by those who aspire to more in life.  In the film's telling, Step represents a momentary way out of bleak surroundings and Wesley, with her intense square jaw and brooding eyes, makes a convincing heroine who's out to prove herself and do something with her life.  Melanie Nicholls-King also gives a credible performance as Raya's mother--a careworn first-generation Jamaican immigrant who works tirelessly to see that the ruthless streets do not claim her only remaining child.  In the end, ""How She Move"" may be a formulaic story that's all-too-familiar, but it is still mildly entertaining.  The pulsating soundtrack features songs by Missy Elliot and Busta Rhymes, among many others.",1214697600,,1975,5.281150159744409

If not for the superb dancing in this movie, the entire project would be nearly without anything substantial or worthwhile.

Rayanna Green (Rutina Wesley) is not only a good student, but she's also a great dancer who has to earn the respect of the boys in the dance crew.  Somehow this group manages to get tons of school time, and the auto-shop facilities to practice their moves, while fulfilling and/or overcoming every clich&eacute; in cinema history.  Among those clich&eacute;s is obviously the big dance-off ending with corny DJs, and I can guarantee you can guess the winner.  This movie is so unoriginal, I think the makers of Stomp the Yard, Step Up, and Save the Last Dance should look into legal proceedings.

I remember seeing the preview of this movie, thinking it was a bland remake, and writing it off.

3136408,2,B0014Z4ORA,"The urban-dance drama, ""How She Moves,"" springs to life only when its high-energy, talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera.  Otherwise, this stale strive-suffer-and-succeed story is low on energy, low on originality, and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other likeminded films that have come before it.

You would have been amped up on the edge of your seat, only for them to drop the loser ball and have you feeling like crap afterwards. Then you would have been wondering what would happen to her afterwards, given that she didn't win the money to go to med school, etc. Then they would have had to make a sequel.

Overall, I love this movie - and after about 5 years, I definitely ordered the DVD.",1401408000,,964,4.1550802139037435

In my day, it was Dirty Dancing (which wasn't that great either IMHO). I'd prefer to see a pure dance vid or documentary rather than fast-forwarding through the ""story"" to get to the juicy parts. For the record, Me No Like How She Move.",1339632000,,432,5.171428571428572
3370915,3,B0014Z4ORA,"I bought the movie and i still have only watched it all the way through once , I try but , i get bored usually after her male beau in movie puts hisself on the line to get her on his crew then i skip to watch the end of the movie at the step monster when they dance after that i turn it off. Really the storyline is boring and homegirl is really selfish she really doesn't care about anybody but herself through the whole movie thats why i watch only beginning and the end cause she pisses me off i mean she went through all that to get into boarding school not college but a boarding school and I understand graduating from good school can get you into a better college but come on you went there almost 2 years and had to leave becase of financial reasons i could be wrong but im guessing if you grades were still goood in school you went back too and maybe if she took some college courses at a community college in her spare time she could have still got into a ivy league college without the prep school like i said i could be wrong in my opinion she did too much snd crossed to many people for prep school who does that",1271635200,,1125,4.026785714285714

Yes, she was a beginner in the business but girlfriend has heart in this movie.  Plus, the step dancing is fantastic.  I pledged a sorority when I was in college and I and my sisters actually used to stomp like that.  Well, not exactly like that because we weren't professionals.  But, boy did this movie bring back good memories.  Watch it, and have fun while doing it.",1473120000,,531,4.303030303030303
