I bought there Past and Present VHS when it first came out,I lost it through the years, if anyone has a copy for sell please email asap...if anyone can check out there show please do..",1052265600,2,395,4.076923076923077
333071,5,6301559584,This is a must have for all the NE fans. I just wish thre was more live footage. Come to think of I wonder why NE never did a live album ?,975196800,3,138,3.34375
333072,4,6301559584,"I've been a fan of New Edition since ""Candy Girl"", and what this group has accomplished over the years is nothing short of incredible!  New Edition ""Past and Present"", takes you along on the journey as the  guys evolve from ""Boys to Men.""  The concert footage and  interviews were awesome.  As  new edition is a Dance band/vocal performance group, the visual aide of the  live performances greatly enhanced the enjoyment of this video.  The show  stopper video was Johnny Gills lead voice on ""Boys to Men.""  The  performance was simply incredible, and the fellas was ""steppin'""  for real!  For true NE fans, this was the gem of the video.  Thank God for  the Temptations, for without them, we may have never heard, ""Ronnie,  Bobby, ( Johnny ), Ricky, & Mike..., and of course the original Lead  voice of NE, Mr. Sensitivity, Ralph.  My only complaint, was that there  wasn't more live footage!  For instance, a live performance of ""Can  you stand the Rain"" & ""If it isn't Love"".  I mean the  fellas dance routines on these numbers were nothing short of outstanding!  Hey fellas, if your listening, how about a live concert video?  If you're a true fan of NE, get the  video, you will enjoy it.  I wish all the members of NE continued success,  and hope they record together again soon!  Peace...",956361600,15,1295,4.65625
333073,5,6301559584,"This video is absolutely great! The title, ""Past and Present,"" really shows it all. With this video, people can really grow up with New Edition, as so many people did. It goes through almost a decade and  basically shows the whole story. The video contains videos, clips, and  other footage from 1983-1989, as well as interviews with Ralph Tresvant,  Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Ronnie DeVoe, and Johnny Gill. Highly  recommended!",952214400,10,430,5.1

7812358,5,6301559584,I love this movie! I have no issues with it at all lol,1488844800,,54,3.230769230769231
7812359,4,6301559584,"This is a video tape with New Edition and their music videos called ""Past and Present, and it's a video tape that came out in 1989 after the release of New Edition's first 5 albums from 1983, and this video tape has all of their videos from their first 3 albums and 5th album. Their fourth album is a christmas album, so it doesn't count. But I would still play it along with the albums and songs from this video tape though. This video tape with New Edition also shows interviews with them talking and showing their videos. I remember back in the era when this video tape came out was when Bobby Brown left the group and went solo, and Johnny Gill joined the group. So in one of the interviews with New Edition talking, they talk about the reason for Johnny Gill being in the group and the reason for Bobby Brown leaving the group. And I have to now say that one of my favorite videos from this video tape with New Edition is ""NE Heartbreak,"" one of their then new videos with them singing and dancing, wearing yellow and black, and riding on mopeds. I also like the earlier videos with New Edition from 1983 to 1985, and from when they were young in the beginning. And in one the those videos with them singing, it shows them playing basketball, and that video is ""Cool It Now."" It also shows clips and segments from some of their other earlier videos, and interviews with them talking about the basketball charity they played around that era. And pretty much for the most part, this video tape shows all of New Edition's then newer videos from their 1988 album, ""Heart Break,"" an album that was their fifth and that came out a year before this video tape.

In my opinion, alot of people that might be New Edition fans don't know anything about this video tape with their music videos. So, I can tell you that it's my favorite video tape to watch with them singing. And along with watching it, I would play and listen to 5 of New Edition's first albums on CD's that I have and that came out in the same era as this video tape with their videos. I would also play and listen to the ""Don't Be Cruel"" album by Bobby Brown, an album that came out in the same year as New Edition's ""Heart Break"" album, so to remember that Bobby Brown was with the group, and had left and went solo. This video tape with New Edition is the best I've ever seen with their music videos, and I would watch it over again as much to enjoy. I have it stored in a zip-loc bag with all five CD's of New Edition's first albums from 1983 to 1988, and I have the ""Don't Be Cruel"" album by Bobby Brown stored with them, so that's like a collection. I remember when I was a kid, I started to like New Edition and their music.

The songs and videos from this video tape with New Editon is

""If It Isn't Love""
""Crucial""
""NE Heartbreak""
""Cool It Now""
""Mr. Telephone Man""
""Count Me Out""
""Boys To Men""
""Can You Stand The Rain""
""You're Not My Kind Of Girl""

Some of New Edition's other earlier videos with clips and segments from this video tape is

""Candy Girl""
""Popcorn Love""
""She Gives Me A Bang""
""Is This The End""
""My Secret (Didja Git It Yet)""

And the albums by New Edition that these songs and videos are from is ""Candy Girl,"" ""New Edition,"" ""All For Love,"" and ""Heart Break,"" their very first albums from 1983 to 1988.

I was even trying to transfer this video tape to a DVD off of a VCR combination with a DVD recorder, and I tried to copy it on a blank video cassette tape so I that I can still have my original copy of this video tape kept as a duplicate, but it wasn't able to let me copy it because of the security inside of the tape itself. And this is still something good to watch  with New Edition that I really enjoy watching, and I wouldn't want the video tape to wear out the more I use it to watch. And it really would be nice for me to have this video tape released on DVD, so that I can see it well and clear with no tracking.",1422316800,4,3910,4.190159574468085

7812362,5,6301559584,"I was so ecstatic when I received my copy of Past and Present. New Edition is definitely amongst the greatest to have ever done it. This video took me back to the good old days when I was a kid and life was carefree. Looking at this video and seeing them now the men of NE are still sharp and on point as ever. As the years have gone by, these men like wine have just gotten better with time. Their new album One Love captures this same NE element. I can not wait to see them in concert next month. NE 4 EVA!

7812364,5,6301559584,"I love this video. It features my favorite NE video of all-time, N.E. Heartbreak (directed by Malcolm Jamal Warner). It's too bad that NE don't get the respect they deserve because w/o NE there would be no NKOTB(a white boy NE) NSYNC, Backstreet Boys and countless other male groups. I can't wait for the reunion!!The videos featured on here are: If It Isn't Love; N.E. Heartbreak; Cool It Now; Count Me Out; Mr. Telephone Man & Can You Stand The Rain. It also features live performances of Crucial; Boys To Men & You're Not My Kind of Girl & some clips from some of their older videos.
