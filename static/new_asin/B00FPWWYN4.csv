8617838,3,B00FPWWYN4,"Other than 2 gorgeous actresses with tiny waistlines, celebrated at the beginning, this movie just has lots of extras running or charging and shooting on horseback around the back lot.  The bad guy never misses, and his single-shot pistol reloads quickly and even works full of swamp water.  OK.  I read online that the house in this movie was re-used in THIS ISLAND EARTH, so I wanted to see if the same paintings were on the wall.  You know, the burger in Exeter's office..  Nope.  Major disappointment for me.  And the house was torn down. Historically, one wonders if the Old South really wasted time and money trying to defeat an ancient homestead family.  OMG, what nonsense.  Just another miserable copy of Gone With The Wind?  Looks like a Disney version on a bad cloudy day shot among the eucalyptus around the pond seen in CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON.  You do finally wonder if that destroyed tree, now a stump--still with the Tap Roots inscription in concrete font--is now located in some director's  Man Cave in his Beverly Hills mansion.  Frankenstein's Monster as an Indian, a nice guy after all.  Most movies have at least a couple of good things.  Take the worthwhile scene with the ladies in their darling undies, being corseted too tight.  Yum.  How could they even breathe?  Oh, I was doing Lamaze deep breathing for them.  And love that plump black maid who just loves being a slave.  Youza!  No picking cotton or getting whupped, just happy housekeeping.  Why are old movies now resurrected by France?  Subtitles optional?",1457308800,,1546,4.79467680608365
8617839,5,B00FPWWYN4,"Ok, the previous feedback had technical problems with this issue, me not, except i couldn't remove the french subtitles which does bother a bit. But the film itself is a real treat with all concerned actors in best condition, especially Susan Hayward in a Scarlett O'Hara-like role in which she looks very beautifully. The story is well told and all actors do their best to fulfill their roles with life. Highly recommended especially for Hayward Fans and Fans of the Dixieland - the southern States.",1442534400,2,500,4.894117647058824
8617840,1,B00FPWWYN4,Image keeps braking up and frequently jumps whole sections of the movie. Several times it stopped altogether and I had to go back to the menu and fast forward to get it past the section where it stopped. Eventually after this had happened several times I gave up. Unwatchable DVD,1398902400,2,279,4.6
