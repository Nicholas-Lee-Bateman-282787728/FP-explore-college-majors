5080500,4,B007F8ZDES,This movie was alright. Our 8 year old wasn't impressed too much and as adults  my hubby and I found it ok but a bit slow moving. All in all it was a little entertaining. It had some pretty good adult humor .,1435104000,,208,3.8372093023255816

8515570,5,B007F8ZDES,Love both movies and really liked the option of buying both on one disc. I am not sure why these movies weren't more popular because they are great movies for the family with the right amount of witty adult humor without being dirty.,1502755200,,233,4.441860465116279
8515571,5,B007F8ZDES,"The classic Little Red Riding Hood tale told as never before. I thought the first movie ""Hoodwinked"" was fantastic. Hoodwinked Too was also well made and enjoyable.

8515573,2,B007F8ZDES,"I must change my review on this product, not because of the movie, I know it's a really cute movie.  When my grandson opened his gift, he could not play it because it was made in a different country that uses a different format from US.  This was very disappointing.",1475712000,2,266,4.3
8515574,5,B007F8ZDES,"Saw this movie on Netflix and I had to buy a copy, it was so funny! The double set is very nice though the 2nd movie isn't as good as the first (still funny though). Great price for the combo set as well!",1474675200,,204,3.7674418604651163
