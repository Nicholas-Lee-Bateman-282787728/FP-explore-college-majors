8463359,5,B005AKIMS2,"We weren't sure what could possibly be more advanced than the moves videos this instructor has out but were impressively surprised by Advanced volume 1 as it really did turn up the heat.  In the intro they go over what is to be taught and after they did I took a seat oh boy, this one might be hard to learn.  I was wrong, Shawn stuck to his step by step format and my wife and I were able to follow along with only hitting the rewind button twice.  That said we did have to stop and move some more furniture out of our way about half way through the DVD so be sure you have enough square footage to work with before you buy this one.  Hands down great video, 6 Stars!",1399507200,,668,4.0
