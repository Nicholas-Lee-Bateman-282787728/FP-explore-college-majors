4385612,3,B004IB04RG,"This 3 action-packed dvd collection give you a close-up view of early 70's southern chase movie with incompetent law enforcement. The best of the three dvd is ""The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"", starring Claudia Jenning(""Gator Bait"")and Jocelyn Jones(""Tourist Trap""),two female Thelma & Louise type who rob banks with dynamite. This comedy-action flick has alot of hot nudity, car chases, graphic shooting and huge explosion. The Second dvd,""Georgia Peaches"", is an entertaining tv pilot that starred , Dirk Benedict,Tanya Tucker,and Sally Kirkland. This failed tv pilot was country singer Tanya Tucker's first acting experience, and she sings most of her song in this movie. The story involves a moonshiner,female mechanic, and a country singer working with the government to catch a black market female boss selling both illegal tobacco and smuggling diamond. The last entry,""Smokey Bites The Dust"",is a nerd version of ""Smokey and the Bandit"",starring Jimmy McNichol,brother of actress Kristi McNichol. McNichol's character does nothing, but get into stupid car chases with an inept Sheriff, while trying to win the heart of the Sheriff's daughter. All three movies show a time in the seventy, when films were cheesy,unpc,and stereotypical southern attidude. The cinematography of the 70's had all the  natural setting with no CGI and the stunt-work that was roughly basic. The viewers  who watched this dvd collection would feel the realism of car crashing as if they were the driver.",1302480000,10,1486,5.428571428571429
4385613,4,B004IB04RG,"Just gotta say this triple feature two disc DVD is a blast! Good to finally get the Claudia Jennings classic The Great Texas Dynamite Chase in anamorphic widescreen, is worth the price alone. The quality is good comparing to original pan and scan DVD. Still could look better. As for Georgia Peaches (aka Follow that car) from 1980 has a young Tanya Tucker and Terri Nunn (from new wave band Berlin) in a very decent anamorphic widescreen print of the international print. Looks really good for originally made for tv. As for Smokey Bites the Dust, it is sad that this is pan and scan and looks like a tape copy. Horrible transfer! Why didn't Shout try harder to get a decent print of this forgetful classic. Still a fun movie, but this bad transfer is hard to watch (and dark). The only special feature is two trailers. Sadly, the best transfer of the three is Georgia Peaches. Just wish the other two looked this good. Still, Claudia Jennings on DVD? I am sold! Thankfully this is DVD and not blu ray, boy they would look bad!",1302134400,8,1028,4.502673796791444

8430565,5,B004IB04RG,"3 Action-packed Roger Corman-related movies on 2 discs with a trailer or 2 thrown in for good measure? Well, count me in.

Okay, I'm going to cut right to the (with advance apologies for the inevitable pun) chase. The only reason I bought this set was for ""The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"".

Why, oh why, did I do such a thing when there are 2 other perfectly good movies included? I can simplify that question for me. The answer is that ""The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"" has everything. Everything? Everything. Would I explain that rather brash and frankly boastful statement please? Why sure, since I'm being so polite with myself for a change, I'd be mad if I couldn't.

When I say it has everything, I mean it has EVERYTHING. Look again at the credits. It has Claudia Jennings in it. Do you see it now? It has EVERYTHING.

I could watch Claudia Jennings chew bubblegum, hunt alligator-poachers, hang out with William Smith, roller-skate, or even read the Yellow Pages of a phone book. For 90 minutes. I don't care if she's dressed in an astronaut's uh, uniform, suit, or whatever you call those things.

That's right, even if/when I can't see her face/etc while watching a movie that she's in, I feel more secure knowing she is there on that celluloid. Preferably on a Drive-In screen, but since that doesn't happen often enough in a lifetime, this wonderful DVD set will do nicely enough. Yes, she was beautiful, but my heart is forevermore saddened by the fact that she is no longer with us. She was a great actress and added life to every roll i have seen her in. Amen.",1513209600,,1574,4.567375886524823
