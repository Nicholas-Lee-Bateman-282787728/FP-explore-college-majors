Not only did the recipes turn up some very yummy food but watching Chef Teton instruct me on how to make these delicious foods was great!! She definitely knows how to interact with her audience and just makes you want to start cooking and eating healthy. :) I am very pleased with this DVD and am looking forward to seeing what other wonderful recipes Chef Teton will come up with next. :) I would highly recommend this Chef and DVD to everyone. :)",1283126400,4,677,4.2153846153846155
