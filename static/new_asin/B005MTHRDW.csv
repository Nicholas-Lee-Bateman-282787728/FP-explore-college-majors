Underbelly is a fictionalized acount of the Melbourne gangland war that lasted from 1995 to 2004.
It starts with Underbelly A Tale of Two Cities. The series revolves around two infamous drug lords ""Aussie Bob"" Trimbole and Terry ""Mr. Asia"" Clark.
Clark comes to Sydney intent on establishing a heroin racket. The younger dealer approaches Aussie Bob with his idea. Bob passes at first.
News spreads to local crime figure George Freeman, who gives Clark a beatdown, met to him back to New Zealand, where he came from. Instead he goes back to Bob, and convinces him that he is the real thing. The two form an awkward partnership.
There first problem is a local politician, Donald Mackay, who intends to put an end to Austrailia's drug problems. Bob first tries to bribe the candidate with women and money, but when neither works decides a hit is neccessary.
Detective Liz Cruickshank is tipped off about the murder plot but can't get the higher-ups to listen. Even after the murder takes place, she realizes she has her work cut out for her. There's high level police corruption everywhere.
The series debuted with double episodes attracting an average of 2,501,500 viewers nationally, in the mainland capitals.
It's a down-under version of The Sopranos. Lots of deception, mistrust, crossed lovers and down under violence pepper the series. The only down side is trying to follow the accents, which at times, are hard to understand without backing up.",1356566400,,1516,4.992094861660079
4836919,5,B005MTHRDW,This is one of the best shows i've ever seen. Perfect combination of true crime and drama. Can't wait for the fourth series to be released.,1356307200,,139,4.384615384615385
4836920,5,B005MTHRDW,the product was brand new and it is one of the best shows I have seen in years. It took three days for me to watch a whole season,1335052800,,129,3.4827586206896552
4836921,5,B005MTHRDW,"This is an awesome TV series, an entertaining look into the underworld in Sydney and Melbourne, loved it, very addictive!
However, I purchased it because it said it was region free because I live in Denmark and needed to make sure it would work, THIS IS WRONG!!! It comes from America and so has the American region code, BE WARNED, therefor it only works on my computer!!!",1334620800,,373,4.582089552238806
4836922,5,B005MTHRDW,I very appreciate this product. I learned a lot about criminality in Australie. Underbelly is a good mini serie. I would have the new underbelly season 4 THE RAZOR.Thanks for this product Amazon.,1330560000,,195,4.9393939393939394
4836923,5,B005MTHRDW,"Americans rejoice, if you want down & dirty criminal entertainment these 3 seasons of various Australian crime waves kick... you know what! There is none of the navel-gazing-Mafia-Don-on-a-couch-with-a-shrink that ruined The Sopranos for me here. All 39 episodes were a heckuva lotta fun to watch. The Aussie flavor gives it a nice spin, but the appeal is universal. If you like stories about bad guys, drug dealers, good cops, bad cops & innocent people caught in their cross hairs you won't go wrong here. Thank whoever for making it available on our DVD players in ""The States"".",1329868800,10,581,5.0
4836924,1,B005MTHRDW,Word of warning: this dvd only plays on region 1 dvd players (no luck for europeans and australians among others) despite the product description that says it is all regions!!!,1327881600,,176,4.9
4836925,4,B005MTHRDW,"Just to up the average star rating - I think this is well produced series from Down Under. Gritty, NSFW, but a good view into crime in the 70/80s.",1326240000,,146,4.068965517241379
4836926,1,B005MTHRDW,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, it is a great show and the desciption clearly says this is an all regions dvd however this does not play on australian dvds.",1325203200,,166,4.0606060606060606

4836929,5,B005MTHRDW,"I began watching this series as I noticed that Dustin Clare was in one of the seasons, then I was hooked.  I rarely like music on a sound track as it tends to drown out the speakers, but in this case the eclectic selection of music underscored and enhanced a full throttle, all the stops out, ride.  Like watching a 12 hour music video.  None stop action!  I particularly liked the 'style' the fast cutting with brief freeze frame for a title to let you know the name of each new character and his sometimes whimsical by line - ""Guido Caletti, Greengrocer"",  the slightly skewed reality reminded me  of some foreign films I have seen.  The only thing they did not do was talk to the camera.

The series has been compared to the Sopranos.  No way.  The Sopranos was a black comedy.  Although there was an overall series arc, each one-hour episode could stand alone; whereas Underbelly is a serial, and each episode continues where the previous one left off.

I found the show to be refreshingly different and thoroughly enjoyed seeing unknown actors and fresh locations.  Australia has a huge stable of very good actors.  Unfortunately after this series many of them will be seduced by Hollywood and end up in routine formulaic police dramas.  My only gripe with the DVD is the lack of captions or subtitling which makes it difficult for me being hearing impaired.",1447718400,,1363,4.644351464435147

4836932,2,B005MTHRDW,I managed to get through two episodes. Bad acting! Looks like a poorly made 1980's TV show that only comes on after midnight. Not even close to The Wire.,1442361600,,153,4.310344827586207
4836933,3,B005MTHRDW,Was an ok series. Not the best actors,1434412800,,37,3.75
4836934,4,B005MTHRDW,We traveled there  few years ago and got hooked on underbelly series. Glad to own the wheel set.,1426809600,,96,4.333333333333333
4836935,5,B005MTHRDW,I loved the series on TV and now I can watch them when I want.,1417478400,,62,3.2
4836936,5,B005MTHRDW,"Superb Acting by many of Australia`s most talented actors highlights this masterfully written series inspired by actual events.
If you liked "" The Sopranos"" you will love this series. It is at times raw, and uncensored , as it should be , to tell this story. Based on some actual events, it rivets you from start to finish.
Sit back, and enjoy the ride, This is what great filmmaking is all about.",1417046400,,397,4.527777777777778

4836939,1,B005MTHRDW,"I expected this to be captioned, as I am deaf. Big disappointment, I gave the set to one of my sons who likes crime DVDs and can hear. I ask Amazon to require sellers to post back side pictures of package to show what type of sound and captioning are available so as not to missrepresent quality of products..",1386720000,7,309,4.254237288135593
4836940,5,B005MTHRDW,"This is one of my all time favorite TV shows. One reason is because I lived and worked in Carlton when all the Moran and Williams activities were going on.  It made life quite interesting for me at lunch and dinner time on Lygon street.

The three series were great. My favorite was the first one and my least favorite was the Sydney based one. Obviously this comes from a Melbournian bias.. LOL

A few things about the dvds themselves.
There is no closed captioning or language options.  So if you do not understand some Aussie slang, etc you will never pick up on it.  Also there are no scene selection capabilities.

These are really good shows. I hope they do something on Mark Brandon ""Chopper"" Read now that he as passed on.
The flick ""Chopper"" was good but an Underbelly version could be great.",1383955200,6,801,4.489655172413793
4836941,5,B005MTHRDW,It was a great series and I'm certainly glad I have it. Plenty of action and entertainment with some great acrors,1382918400,,113,4.428571428571429
4836942,5,B005MTHRDW,If you are a fan of foreign tv you don't want to miss this one. Crime and police corruption at it's finest. Each season takes place in the same area but with a different cast of caracters and actors with little carry over from the previous season. Well worth the money and will have me looking for more Australian series to watch,1371945600,,329,4.32258064516129
4836943,4,B005MTHRDW,Very good. I am still in the middle of watching them when I can find the time. I'm enjoying the series again.,1371945600,,109,4.0
4836944,5,B005MTHRDW,well-spiced with nudity and plenty of gangsta action...this set of seasons is addictive and fascinating.  well-developed characters and top shelf acting combine to make hours of entertainment...and some insight into a shady world most of us never see,1371513600,,250,5.578947368421052
4836945,5,B005MTHRDW,"These 3 Seasons have great acting by mostly actors unfamiliar to me, good writing and direction.  The only actor I ever recall seeing before is Dustin Clare as a sociopathic hitman in Seaon Two, who plays Gannicus in the Spartacus Starz series.  Seaons One was good, but due to the facts, many good characters are killed very quickly after meeting them.  Season Two is probably the best season, with more in-depth coverage of mainly two main criminals, one with some redeeming qualities and the other without, but both still pretty bad.  Season Three introduces the strong female Federal agent Gerry Lloyd, played by Sigrid Thornton and goes more into the police corruption aspect of the drug business.  While the seasons cover three different 10-year periods, the characters are mostly different, with a few characters that carry-over from the prior season, including the narrator.  I would like to see more of Gerry Lloyd's story in future seasons.  This 3 full-season box set is definitely the economical way to buy this series. Once you buy one, you will likely want to see the rest. Lots of non-gratuitous & gratuitous nudity by mostly ""natural"" women. Sub-titles for the hearing-impaired would have been helpful as in some cases it is hard to understand what a few of the characters are saying due to their Australian accent, but that is not a major problem, as you get the gist of what is going on.",1369699200,2,1405,4.853556485355648
4836946,5,B005MTHRDW,"Excellent movies, they should  not be compare to the Soprano,which had the same character for each season. Each season had new storyline, new characters role but overall a good gangster series.",1369267200,4,193,5.225806451612903
8479768,5,B005MTHRDW,"I was so excited to find the Underbelly Trilogy for less than $20.00. I became a fan when it aired on Directv audience channel. One thing I must mentioned, regarding shipping. The package was not handed directly to the resident. It was waiting for me, in front of my door when I arrived home from work.",1519948800,,302,4.410714285714286
8479769,5,B005MTHRDW,"This is one of the best trilogy's ever.  Be prepared for something that you don't usually see on US TV, but then again this is from Australia where they don't have the same kind of censorship as the US does.  Get ready for lots of swear words and nip-tuck style sex scenes, but in the end this is one great series of all that bad stuff that went on for real in Australia back in the day.  Some of this is almost comic, as there is a big drug dealer that was using a 'secret compartment' in his luggage to smuggle drugs from Thailand to OZ...but I guess it did work in the day!!!
Underbelly has 6 seasons and 3 movie specials, and all are top quality OZ stuff.  If you like some gritty stuff that breaks the boundaries of the US style shows of this style, check it out!!!",1515801600,,770,4.113333333333333

8479775,5,B005MTHRDW,"Excellent series. If you like period pieces like Boardwalk Empire or like the Sopranos, you will love this series. Top notch acting based on a true story. It was so accurate that they couldn't air it in some parts of Australia when it aired on TV. Many people who were portrayed in the series were still awaiting sentencing and they were afraid it would interfere with their prosecution.",1469664000,,387,4.705882352941177
