Only drawback is that it's an older video that is not in HD.

2889667,5,B000SQDS0U,"It has taken me awhile to approach this review, since it is hard to be effusive about a calendar...it has nice photos , makes me think of a place that I like, is the perfect size for the side of the fridge, and arrived quickly.  Wow, that was not so hard after all!",1369526400,,265,4.0
2889668,5,B000SQDS0U,"In 1967, Scott Mackenzie's lyrics told us, ""If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair...""  Forty-five years later, the flowers may be optional, but if you're going to San Francisco, you'd do well to watch this excellent guide to the sights of the City by the Bay.  I reveled in remembering the unique San Francisco attractions I saw on my first visit, while scribbling down those I want to see next time I'm in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Enjoy this excellent guide to one of America's most alluring cities.",1343174400,4,552,4.555555555555555
2889669,2,B000SQDS0U,"I was excited about hearing about San Francisco, but ultimately disappointed in this DVD.  While it did cover almost every part of the city, most places were given only one or two sentences and sometimes just video with no commentary at all. This DVD is WAY short on information and appears to be shot in the early 90's.  Also, too much time was spent on tourist traps that are well known and not enough was shown about the wonderful neighborhoods of San Francisco. I was hoping for more.",1246406400,2,488,4.534090909090909
8206388,3,B000SQDS0U,"If you want a very basic and very boring overview of the city, start here. Other than that, not much to learn from this. Best if you've never been there and have no idea what is offered.",1520985600,,186,4.054054054054054
8206389,5,B000SQDS0U,"This video offers the hilights of San Francisco. It briefly covers San Francisco, and other close by cities in the Bay Area. Beautiful video of the city.",1492300800,,153,4.703703703703703

8206391,1,B000SQDS0U,Godawful travelogue with even worse canned music. Like something I would have been forced to sit through in junior high. Somebody could learn a thing or two about making a decent travel program by watching Rick Steves.,1444176000,,218,4.918918918918919

8206395,4,B000SQDS0U,"I liked this tour of SF. Touched on a lot of landmarks with in the city. It would be better if it were HD/wide screen, also the video captured is a bit dated. But the information was still there, not only did they show you a place, they also showed you what a tour of it looks like, ie Alcatraz.",1430265600,,295,3.933333333333333
