8188418,3,B000P29GKI,ok movie not god not bad but you couldn't beat it for basically 3 bucks plus I love lacey chabert brian newmeyer,1403049600,,112,4.136363636363637
8188419,2,B000P29GKI,"You know when you watch a film and you cannot remember much about it after seeing it a few days earlier, this is your type of movie then.  It made no impression on me and I just remember it was there, not good, just there.  So, I do not really recommend watching it.",1370304000,,266,4.0
8188420,2,B000P29GKI,"I only purchased this movie because I worked on the set when it was filming.  There are some random scenes that are good, and John Krasinksi is great.  But overall, very cliched, too long, poor quality, and boring.",1264982400,,214,4.605263157894737
8188421,1,B000P29GKI,"What a waste of time and $0.99.  I can understand that actors need to eat, what i do not understand is why someone will actually produce such crap. I would not be surprised if the story was actually written by a 5th grader.",1244851200,,223,4.186046511627907
8188422,2,B000P29GKI,"John Krasinski is definitely the only redeemable part of this movie.  Nothing happened.  At all.  Just a lot of waiting around.  The end was interesting though.  If the rest of the movie was like the end, then it could have lived up to all the hype.",1199318400,2,249,4.326086956521739
8188423,5,B000P29GKI,I have been waiting for this to come out forever! No Krasinski collection is complete without this film.,1186963200,5,104,4.833333333333333
