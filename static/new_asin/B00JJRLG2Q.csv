6362956,5,B00JJRLG2Q,Good nature program....I love animals and enjoy learning about them and seeing people help them.,1405641600,3,96,5.466666666666667
6362957,5,B00JJRLG2Q,"My wife and I saw the Nature: Leave It to Beavers on PBS this morning. Decimation of the beaver population was nearly complete, but the Nature show illustrates new attempts for humans to co-exist and cooperate with the beaver. More significant, there were moments of sincere emotional sharing and understanding between the beavers raised and nurtured by humans. There are instances where young beavers require human intervention to provide emotional bonding and companionship, particularly when the beavers lost their own families or were seriously injured.

One of the best parts of the show provided positive evidence how humans can positively and creatively adapt with the challenges of beavers whose dams become serious problems to human endeavors. Rather than simply killing the beaver or trapping them and taking them to distant locations, there was one instance of humans adapting. I am seriously recommending Nature: Leave It to Beavers to the Penobscot Nation of Maine (I'm a tribal member) as a means of making a cooperative effort with the beaver in the very near future! And, to all others, I believe the show will inform, give hope, and perhaps provide unique solutions to drought struck regions.",1400371200,20,1209,5.231958762886598
6362958,5,B00JJRLG2Q,"Beavers are a keystone species for North America. They are mammals and like swans are a species that mates for life. They are especially good for deserts and land in drought conditions. Many western states are now beginning to introduce them back into the environments. They dig ponds and dams which slows water lost and recharges ground water rather than have it run off.

Beavers dig their ponds deeper and so in drought conditions ponds with beaver are usually the only water in an area. In the Nevada desert beaver turned a once dry river bed into a wetland in a few years time when reintroduced into the area. Hopefully ranchers will begin to reintroduce beaver to their lands to conserve water. -- J.E. Ante",1400025600,12,713,4.704

6362995,5,B00JJRLG2Q,"This is a wonderful DVD for adults and children, ages 10 and up. It really shows the importance of beavers to ecological systems, especially how they can create an oasis in the American SW desert. The Beavers are adorable! It's nice to watch a nature film that does not show ""blood and guts"", or animals being attacked. Instead, it shows how they are rescued and brought back to habitats in need of the beavers-very uplifting.",1438905600,6,426,4.693333333333333

6363010,5,B00JJRLG2Q,"Me and my husband love Beavers and we've watched several Beaver documentaries. This particular one is different than the others we've watched, with this one focusing on the conservation efforts to preserve Beavers, rather than the habits. If you're looking for more of the behaviors and facts of beavers I would suggest Rocky Mountain Beaver Pond done by National Geographic. If however you want something with more ""what are we doing for the beavers"" or you're like us and have watched every other beaver movie you can get your hands on, then you should get this documentary",1421280000,5,575,4.938144329896907

6363015,5,B00JJRLG2Q,"Another fine episode from an excellent series. Beavers are the Rodney Dangerfields of the animal world, and the respect they should be getting from us is finally appearing in some places. These unique rodents are the absolute cornerstone of many creatures' chance to exist in the wild, as they maintain healthy fresh water habitats for almost all animals over massive areas of land. They accomplish what our corps of engineers can only dream of in terms of efficiency and dedication, and their inherent usefulness wherever they arrive (except for over-developed biped territories) is legendary. They help create and sustain all sorts of life forms, simply by following their instincts. If only we humans could say the same! We could learn a lot from these smart, busy little guys, as this show makes clear.

The 53-minute program highlights a few different cases of homeless beavers being nurtured by humans and then reintroduced into the wild. There are some amazingly kind and compassionate women who shine here. One of the most dedicated beaver rescuers in North America is shown in action in Colorado, and the lady from Ontario's strong connection with the baby is a very sweet thing indeed. As is the 85 year-old lady's deep joy in seeing beavers come back to the valley she grew up in when they were plentiful. The camerawork is excellent, the narration intelligent, and mini remote cameras even take us into beaver dens to watch them raising their young.

And being hoteliers for various animals during winter! Yes, beavers often feed and give shelter to muskrats, frogs and others during the freezing months when no food is available. How many animals do that? And their sense of belonging to and constantly improving their environment is one of the many lessons we bipeds need to learn from this most industrious of mammals. This program gently points this out, and after watching it with our dog we felt all warm and fuzzy about our connection with her, and how incredible this planet we share with all other creatures truly is.

And dang, you can't ask much more from a nature film than that.

And since your tax dollars have already helped make this show, if you can't afford the dvd, this and other excellent Nature episodes may still be showing on the show's website, or on various sites on the net with flicks.

Yay for beavers!

Highly recommended.",1413763200,2,2364,4.882793017456359
6363016,5,B00JJRLG2Q,"Wow, I had no idea the benefits these critters bring to nature and humanity. They can turn a desert into a forest, and basically any place with running water into a spring of wildlife. They need to be brought back to the continents they thrived in, and we can adjust to make room for all of the benefits these iron-toothed rodents can offer.",1413590400,6,341,4.428571428571429
6363017,5,B00JJRLG2Q,"This is a great and touching documentary that highlights the industriousness of these
cute little animals and how beneficial they are to the environment by causing water
to collect in ponds.  The Americans came close to killing them all to make hats -- so,
we can be thankful that fashions changed.  The Americans (and others) almost killed all the whales
to light the world's lamps -- so, we can be thankful that commercial oil was found.
Not to mention the buffalo.
And Americans killed all the passenger pigeons -- every single one.
So, enjoy this nice nature documentary about this species we allowed to live.",1408924800,5,613,4.828571428571428
