Michael Guillen does a good job in exploring the ancient Chinese invention and master the complicated principles of fluid mechanics and aerodynamics thousands years before the West.  There were American and British scholars interviews to testify the innovations.  It helps to understand the eastern origins of Western Civilization.

The invention of compass, paper and silk making helped them achieve the greatest civilization on earth in the Ming Dynasty.  The program compares the Treasure ships of Zheng He and Columbus. Admiral Zheng sailed seven voyages of peace and won hearts and minds.  These two navigators had different outcomes on world history - war and peace, virtue and power, friendship and slavery, goodwill and disease.
