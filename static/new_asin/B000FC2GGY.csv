8120701,1,B000FC2GGY,I received this DVD over a year ago and it had a Chevy DVD in the case instead of the Dodge Charger. I sent it back and received another one which had the same mistake. I sent it back again and got my money back. If I knew they have this problem straightened out I would order it again.,1374019200,,286,3.864406779661017
8120702,5,B000FC2GGY,"If you are a car nut or Mopar lover like me --
the American Muscle Car TV series was one of the
very best ever produced.  This is probably my
favorite volume from the show.  The Viper segment
is now a bit outdated, but is still pretty cool
to watch.",1337990400,,249,3.96
8120703,5,B000FC2GGY,"This is the story about Dodge Viper from drawings, prototype to street legal car, promoted by the legends that created it, and some interviews by entusiasts packed in with short movies, a great dvd about the Viper and lots of ""burn outs"" that tells this is a story bout a real american musclecar not a american car that is fried to be compared with european sportscars.

8120704,4,B000FC2GGY,"If you like Dodge Chargers, you'll love this DVD.  Watch restored Chargers in action on the street.  Narration was also informative, describing the differences between the model years.  I'm not much of a Viper fan, so I haven't watched that part of the DVD.",1266710400,,257,4.795454545454546
