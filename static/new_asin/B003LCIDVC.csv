8399637,4,B003LCIDVC,I thought this movie was great but not enough of Michael Muhney which is the reason I ordered it but great movie anyway.,1391731200,,120,4.260869565217392
8399638,4,B003LCIDVC,"Enjoyable independent film set in NYC's singles scene with a varied ensemble cast. Fun to see many familiar faces including TV's Michael Muhney, who does a terrific job in a role much different from the one he played on VERONICA MARS.",1381536000,,234,4.7317073170731705
8399639,5,B003LCIDVC,This is a great indy movie. It takes place over (you guessed it) One Night. Set in NYC it follows the events that unfold among a group of friends. I watched it so that I would see Michael Muhney in another role other than his role as Adam Newman on Young and the Restless. He was excellent. Very talented actor. Worth watching all the way. Super talented cast all around.,1327968000,,371,4.314285714285714
