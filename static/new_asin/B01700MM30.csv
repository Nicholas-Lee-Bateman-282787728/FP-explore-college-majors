8737694,5,B01700MM30,"Truly a great Blu-ray, with exceptional video of the races, much better than the U.S. TV broadcasts of the races, with their many poor camera views and terrible clutter of commercials. If you want to see what F1 racing involves short of being there on the course, everywhere which you can't be, invest in these 'Official Review' Blu-ray discs. I have all available since they came to market and they are well worth their reasonable cost, to be able to see what is truly going on.
