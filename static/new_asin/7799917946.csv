Some DVDs of this performance in the version for Region 1 (U.S. and Canada) are selling for around $300.  However, if you purchase this all region player (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BI6MVS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00) for about $55 you can play this $15 PAL DVD and other discs from multiple regions.",1359417600,2,590,5.91764705882353
