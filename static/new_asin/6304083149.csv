787690,4,6304083149,"The movie itself is one of my favorites and I had watched it previously, but never got around to buying a physical copy of it. When I came across this version of the Blu-Ray with the directory's commentary, I ordered it.

The commentary wasn't the best as far as extras go, and I'm saying that as a huge fan of Ron Perlman, his interviews included. The directory didn't seem to have much to say as far as the thought process behind the movie. Seemed a bit random in his choices. Which may just be the way he expressed, especially given that English isn't his first language, so I don't think it takes away from the movie itself, but was just a bit disheartening to hear on the directory's commentary.

It's still nice to have a Blu-Ray copy which is good quality and the movie itself is still a special one.",1502323200,,807,4.373333333333333

To attempt to describe it would be folly, but I'll say it's a crime story in a strange future, with insane characters.

This has to be the worst film I've watched in a long time and I had a cheesy 80s scifi movie marathon not long ago.

788087,3,6304083149,"One one hand, I have to give Sony credit for the 2015 transfer, which is so sharp that one might almost think the movie was shot in HD.  Whether we're talking about lines in people's faces or or textures like burlap, everything is stupendously clear.  The problem, however, is that anything that's shadowed is GONE, dissolved into absolute blackness... which wouldn't be such a problem if this weren't a shadowy noir-influenced fantasy.  Initially I thought the my TV was to blame, but once I started fidgeting with the picture settings, I realized that the contrast was cranked up to 11 in the transfer itself.

The City of Lost Children is 5 star movie (like Mary Poppins herself, it's practically perfect in every way), but I'm deducting one star for the horrible contrast issue, a half-star for the total lack of new extras on this ""anniversary"" release and another half for only releasing it through Amazon (Sony's become really annoying with their ""exclusive"" and greedy smash-and-grab ""limited edition"" blu-ray releases).",1456358400,10,1028,5.06508875739645

788233,3,6304083149,"This perhaps one of the weirdest and yet quite sinister films you are ever likely to see.....
On a tower out to sea a mad-man 'Krank' (Daniel Emilfork)directs his men to go to shore and steal young
children off the streets and their homes, his purpose is to steal their dreams, he has a plan.
We have a 'Fagan' like school to train the young to steal which is run by two grotesque mad-woman from
which a young girl 'Miette' ( Judith Vittette) seeks to find her young brother who had been taken, she
crosses paths with former whaler and strong-man 'One' (Ron Pearlman) who is really a big-softie and will
help 'Miette' rescue her brother and indeed the other children that are held at the tower.
Have to say this is an unusual film with many different and indeed weird characters...the film is a cross
between madness and dare i say genius.
I agree with an earlier reviewers thoughts - you'd not forget the film once seen

788234,5,6304083149,"The old Sony DVD has a brighter, softer look whereas this new Blu-ray has a darker, sharper look. I think the director wanted most of the film's scenes to take place at night or dusk, thus the darker appearance. Images are much more detailed, the exception being areas in shadow are much darker on the Blu-ray, those areas actually have less detail than the DVD. Colors are more consistent on the Blu-ray, particularly the green water and flesh tones.

In the new French DTS sound mix, actors voices can be heard more clearly and the fog horn has noticeably more oomph. The English dub is still available if you want that.

The English subtitles are greatly improved from the DVD which had dubtitles (matching the subpar English dub).

On Blu-ray, the directors commentary track now has a subtitle option. This is a nice feature because Jeunet's English has a very strong accent.

The Blu-ray has the Making Of..."" (good), Archives..."" (can skip), and ""Interview with Gaultier"" (good) that were previously only available on the Deluxe DVD.

The improved picture, sound, and extras on the Blu-ray make it a worthy upgrade from the DVD.",1448064000,51,1134,4.8549222797927465

Like any good sci-fi / fantasy the dark is just as important as the light. It's not a feel good cookie cutter piece of crap with beautiful people and explosions.

One of the more unique movies you will ever see. It is in French though so you must not be bothered by sub-titles. If that is the case you are missing out on 2 of my top ten movies of all time. I've mentioned both in this review.",1446249600,11,589,4.113043478260869

788303,2,6304083149,"I once watched a good chunk of this movie on cable back around 1997 or so, was once
out in NJ attending a day of the Chiller Theater Convention, where, having dinner with friends,
was charmingly ""berated"" by some angry-seeming punk guy who was hanging around the
area where we were talking and having a fast bite to eat, he was horrified and seemed nearly
angry and ready to slug me that I thought what I'd seen of City of Lost Children seemed a bit
derivative of Terry Gilliam, among other things. I didn't think it looked all that original at the time.
This guy's response was to dismiss me as a fool and left with a disgusted look on his face with
a comment like, ""I can't even stand here and talk to you about this."" He left. Thank goodness!

So, cut to 2015 and I finally remember to avail of the newer DVD of the film and sit down and
try to really see if this film did indeed suck, or what.  First of all, it's true, the subtitles on here
are pretty piss-poor, the translation seems clunky at best, and my French isn't the best,
but you could tell it was just hamfisted and often makes zero sense, or little.  The DVD looks
great, sounds great, so no complaints there.  I didn't get time to watch the commentary with
Mr. Perlman and Jeunet, but I'm sure that would have proven illuminating.

My summation after my dressing-down for not loving this film by that angry punk troll guy
in 1997, is that this is a good film, but not nearly a great one.  Some of it does very much
seem VERY derivative of Gilliam's work and many other things, but ok, for the most part
it's visually striking, imaginative, and works on the level of an adult fairly tale and a steampunk
adventure story, etc.

Some of this is really quite disturbing, including children being struck and
abused, etc.  It's disturbing and disquieting, and definitely NOT a children's film!
I mainly enjoyed City but I thought it worked better on a stylistic level,a feast for the senses,
and its outrageous visual antics, than on a story/plot/coherence level. That's for certain.
Ron Perlman is great, the actress that plays Miette is adorable and fantastic, and the whole
cast really shines, freaky or no.  Still thought it was a bit overlong, a bit derivative too many times,
and the ending was pretty silly, anti-climactic, no payoff, emotionally. and just kind of dead in the
water, as it were.  Guy explodes, One gets away with his young charges, good triumphs, the end.
I did enjoy Irvin the brain in the tank, always enjoy a good ""brain in the tank"" film, anyway,
hehe, and this was no different, voiced by no less a figure than Jean-Louis Tritagnant, and such.
The trained deadly fleas with the injected serum were quite entertaining.  I also thought Badalamenti's
amazing score, including the end-credits song by Marianne Faithfull, was more impressive
than most of the film otherwise, no great surprise, given how massive a David Lynch and
Angelo Badalamenti fan I already am/was.

Overall, though, I merely sort of enjoyed City of Lost Children to a 2-3 star degree, at best,
but wasn't sufficiently moved (or really, at all moved by it) to declare it a truly great film.
I found it impressive more for the cast, the production design and FX and conceptual work,
costumes, sound design, and steampunk type of atmosphere, the constructed ""world,""
than the rather thin and derivative storyline and not very deep characters.  I haven't yet
seen Amelie, Delicatessen, and absolutely detested Alien Resurrection, although I look
forward to giving Jeunet's other films a chance, but City of Lost Children, that old annoying,
curmudgeonly punk guy's browbeating of my filmic tastes notwithstanding back in 1997,
was a film that I sort of mildly enjoyed rather than being anything I would rave about,
or watch again and again. It's fun, but I'm sure Jeunet has done finer films, and will do
in the future.

Along these lines I much more enjoyed (and purchased) the newer Blu-ray
of Dark City, a much finer and more neglected film in this general vein, from 1999 or so.
I recommend grabbing that and screening it before this, it's so much more superior
of a modern fantasy SF film, and is just as impressive in terms of its construction of a
a total ""world"" as City is.  So sorry, angry punk guy from 1997, (gotcha, tosser! finally)
I'm sticking to my guns and reiterating what I said then: City of Lost Children is an ok,
enjoyable, but deeply flawed and derivative film by some clearly very talented and
promising people.  Is it awful? No way. Is it 5 stars great? Nah.  You'll have to live with
that one.  And stop thinking that your tastes in film/art are automatically superior
to everyone else's, I went to film school myself, that doesn't mean I think my tastes
are superior to yours, or that I'm somehow insulted when someone doesn't like a film,
novel, or record that I do.

I wish I'd had the presence of mind to let you have it then,
but I'm letting you have it now, even though I'm sure you'll never read this.  I never forget
a bully!  If you think this film is 5 stars you're insane. And if you think Jeunet didn't
totally freakin' rip-off Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Time Bandits, and 10 other things,
you're likewise insane.  That sure as hell hasn't changed with time, either.
And there you have it, folks.  No punk-a-- browbeating by an angry dork punk guy goes unpunished.
At least the rest of that 1997 Chiller Con. was enjoyable.  I even got to meet Candy Clark
from The Man Who Fell To Earth and American Graffiti, the experience of which was
SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE than watching City of Lost Children, I can tell you that much.
And I still cannot stand Alien Resurrection because it's like a bad cartoon version of an
ALIEN sequel, and is so over-the-top ridiculous it made ALIEN 3 look like an utter
masterpiece by comparison. But again, I digress. Sue me.",1444521600,,5843,4.606936416184971

Not exactly gospel, but its a close description of this arrestingly grotesque fantasy. The surreal seaside city is a cold Victorian horror of girders, trusses, rivets and bolts, crisscrossed with canals full of garish green water and populated with funhouse freaks, cyborg Cyclopses, Siamese sisters, clownish clones, trained fleas, hideous midgets, even a disembodied brain in a fish tank.

We enter actual nightmare territory with this insanely original imagerya singularly sinister vision in the tradition of Brazil and Jeunet & Caros previous film, Delicatessen. And as in the latter, even when integrating incredible effects into the film, Jeunet & Caro refuse to let style dominate substance: the entire tender tale revolves around the poignant relationship between gentle giant One (Perlman) and the disenchanted Miette, each protectingand oddly completingthe other.

THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a wild nightmare of a movie, where kids wake up to the arrival of Santa and end up kidnapped and hooked up via tubes and wires to a horrible old man who is hoping to steal their dreams. And that's without mentioning the drug-bombing bug, the people with mechanical third eyes, or cloned brothers and conjoined sisters and a deep-sea diver and a thieves' guild and floating mines...and, oh yes, a talking brain.

Straight from the minds of Marc Caro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Delicatessen/dp/B00AU7X4VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Delicatessen</a>) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet (DELICATESSEN and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelie/dp/B006S01GH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelie</a>) THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is an intensely imagistic film you don't really HAVE TO understand to catch the gist of it and, as a great fan of his work, I can tell you that this is a movie made for people who are driven by uniquely assembled images and intensely visual story telling. It's for people who DON'T turn their head in puzzlement when they see prosthetic eyes; for an audience who are ecstatic when they see three-foot tall women, or quadruplets with red hair dressed in baby poop-green; a movie for those who love periscopes and telescopes and steamy machine intelligence and computers driven by three-inch gears and sprockets.

Caro and Jeunet's audience come to see movies crafted for people with terrific imaginations; movies that pop and dazzle - but not the Michael Bay kind of glitz. No...their audience is the live-action Hayao Miyazaki crowd. These are the people who love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B0091WAN3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>&nbsp;for its caves and ramparts, who enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darkman/dp/B000IDJ9CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darkman</a>'s underworld laboratory, and are enraptured by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hugo/dp/B0094K1NYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hugo</a>&nbsp;for the scenes in the watchtower.

So, even though THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is almost incomprehensible on the first viewing, its true audience knows to be patient, because what really matters to its fans are the gizmos; the scenes swarm with impossible technology and ultimately silly machines and people...with things no less than the impossible.

Caro and Jeunet know their movie's target audience is the kind that would be happy to study single frames of the movie, marveling in their intensely crafted genius. The set pieces are filled with lush and active eye candy that packs the screen with vibrant activity: dripping waterworks; gear-driven machinery; steam-powered gadgets. Its characters might wear uniforms, corsets, lab coats, or even rags; in fact, our hero's slowly unraveling sweater provides a device of hope for our heroine, leaving him with wearing little more up top than sleeves and a collar.

In such a movie, sets are often full of imagery that shrink the power of the individual: steel girders and impenetrable iron walls surround them in maze-like fashion; machinery and waterworks constantly threaten to force characters into the waterways; and a small auditorium's seating rises so impossibly quickly it crowds people practically atop one another. Throughout, shipyards and industrial backgrounds intimidate even our protagonist, a circus strongman who can break steel chains by simply expanding his chest. Ron Perlman, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellboy/dp/B008Y7HJJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellboy</a>&nbsp;fame, isn't a man easily intimidated, but a setting like this practically renders his character impotent.

So who CAN win in a topsy-turvy world such as this? The answer makes as much sense as the movie:  children.

Ron Perlman is an ex-sailor (Russian perhaps) who works as a strongman in a carnival/circus, and has a ""little brother"" who is kidnapped by sinister men wearing mechanical eyepieces making them look like part of the Borg Collective. It's not clear whether ""little brother"" is a real little brother or has been adopted by the strongman, but he loves him and takes care of him just the same. While trying to find where the boy has been taken, he is helped by a young girl who is part of a group of child thieves, just like in Oliver Twist. It has action and adventure, some fantasy elements, some comedy, and at times can be a little gruesome. There is a ""steampunk"" quality to the sets and props, which makes for rich and visually interesting textures. I don't want to provide too many details, because I don't want to be accused of giving out spoilers, and some people say they like to be surprised. It took me 19 years to finally see this, I imagine there are probably a few other people who haven't seen it yet either. The movie was made about 10 years before technology allowed for digital camera systems to be available to production and film crews, so I believe this film was originally on celluloid, then a tape master.  There are a couple of tiny defects that weren't cleaned up in the re-mastering process, such as some white sparks that were most likely on the tape source this transfer was made from. But aside from that, the movie is 99 percent clean, and that's fine in itself. The DVD doesn't have much to offer in special features, a commentary and cast-and-crew backgrounds that haven't been updated since before 2000. The options for spoken languages and dialogue captioning are okay, but the movie is in French, so there are signage and posters that are not translated, in particular the title of the movie itself. But the plot is good and the visuals and colors are eye candy, so if you like such movies as Oliver, Brazil, Baron Munchausen, and James and the Giant Peach, you will find some similar details that are enjoyable.

But...the English language dubbing is dreadful!!

The sync is all over the place...sometimes good...sometimes way off.

I discovered the only way I could enjoy the movie was to put on the original language track (French) and add English sub-titles.

When you compare those performances with the dubbed English you realize how (mostly) truly bad they are.

Someone ought to scrape up the budget to redo the English dub and this movie would find a greater audience outside of France...where I understand it was very successful.

788805,5,6304083149,"The entire cast in this film is fantastic, but then, this director often uses the same great actors. Even the children were great. Ron Perlman is young and very emotive, and the film allows for a blooming human relationship that focuses more of innocent family love than romance (considering the great age difference.) At the same time, it touches on a child's first crush, and the confusion that can bring for one so young.

Despite how dark and unsettling the imagery can be at times, the whole film has a very lackadaisical feel to it. Even during serious scenes, the viewer may pleasantly enjoy him/herself.

The gadgets are truly intricate; the characters are all memorable; and the script is sometimes hilarious, sometimes narrative, and always very clever.

This film stars a pre Hell Boy/Sons of Anarchy Ron Pearlman. In two words: strange and weird. Both of them in a good way, for the most part. You probably picked that up by looking at the strange man on the cover. Oddly enough that picture tells you a lot about this movie. The City of Lost Children is total modern art house galore.  Everything is exaggerated and over the top. It is also so well planned out that it appears well aligned and perpendicular.  In other words it is perfect chaos and everything you see has a special place. It is also heralded as a steam punk masterpiece in certain circles.  Strange technological altered men kidnap the children in a murky city. They try to harness the children's dreams through twisted experiments. A sailor named One (Ron Pearlman) does his best to save the day. The City of Lost Children is a full on cultist extravaganza.  It is chock full of evil Siamese twins, countless clones, talking brains that glow, inexplicable futuristic technology, and above all else: impeccable coincidences with major consequences.  This film is straight up health food for the imagination:Indulge. What does it all mean? That of course is pretty much for you to decide.

I preferred listening to the original French language audio track because the inflections and voices of the named actors is much better in the original language than it is in the voices of the dubbed version, but they also are good, just not as good as the actual actors.  By the way, the ENGLISH dubbed version is the audio track running in the background of the commentary track by one of the directors and Ron Perlman.

The commentary track is really quite insightful and pleasant.  Ron Perlman shares helpful information that is doubly enjoyable when you listen to him.  His comments reveal an intelligent, articulate, and compassionate man who is also very respectful of the directors and other actors in the film.  The director, whose English at times is a little difficult to understand due to his very strong French accent, also offers choice tidbits of information, especially regarding the actors in the film, one of whom he said is actually better known as a singer in his native country (but perhaps only to people in his country!).  The information about sets and design doesn't really interest me in commentaries because sometimes that information detracts from my enjoyment of the fantasy.  In other words, I don't always want to know how something was done or how much it cost, but occasionally it is interesting.

The story of the film was never really explained by the director in the commentary track, and Ron Perlman even commented on how difficult it is to understand it, which he admitted he never fully did.  However, Perlman's portrayal of the character he played in the film (his name is ""One"") is appropriately gentle and kind, so he obviously understood that much of the film VERY well!

The children in the film were awesome!

The DVD video quality is very good when played on an upscaling blu-ray player and the audio quality is good too.  There is also some hauntingly beautiful music played in various sections of the film, and the selection played during the end credits is terrific!

I have wanted to view this film for years but never willing to pay a lot for a DVD version (would have preferred Blu-ray, but that doesn't exist...yet), so when I was able to purchase it directly from Amazon for $7.99, I took the plunge!

A movie to be recommended to anyone above 8 years old (although it may be a bit frieghtening to some children), this is a well balanced story that captures your attention with a tale of morality, life, and love.
As far as the movie itself all aspects are par, nothing jumps put as being particularly special, but you don't notice anything wrong with it either. However, the acting is above average.

At about the 40 minute mark, things got a bit quieter on screen and I could focus on the terrific sets and color (or lack of, more appropriately).

Then all of a sudden this brilliant 10 year old girl takes over the picture.  The girl is beautiful and a wonderful actress and her presence overcomes the silliness of the story.  Played by Judith Vittet she apparently disappeared from the scene after making this film and another in the same year.  IMDb shows she made some appearances on French TV but no more movies.

788878,4,6304083149,"The photograph of villain Krank with electrodes emerging from his head like a crown, resembling an Aztec god, should give everyone a clue that they are in for a unique visual treat with this film. The film is about dream and nightmare, about an evil scientist who kidnaps children to steal their dreams but seems to only capture their nightmares. The film is dark at times, reminding us that the world of children can be very dark indeed especially since they often are at the mercy of idiotic and malevolent adults. All of the children in the film are beautiful and all the adults are grotesque. As a European film, the plot and imagery are influenced by Freud, especially around the topic of the love a child may begin to feel for an adult. It takes about half the film to sort out all the craziness and begin to get a grasp of the plot and characters and their motivations. However, this is not off-putting because you will be totally entertained during that period of perplexity with odd characters doing odd things for odd reasons. The opening scene where some frightening Santa Clause clones come down a chimney to steal little children from their crib clues you in that the images in this film will be unique. My favorite characters were the Siamese twin sisters who organize a pack of orphan thieves. They were brilliant in every scene. Don't miss the scene where they are cooking using all four hands at once. There are pet fleas with the ability to inject deadly drugs and one-eyed Cyclops who have blinded themselves to see the truth and who now who eat children.

Ron Perlman is excellent in the lead, a character called One, a giant circus strongman with curly red hair who is searching for his tiny kidnapped brother with curly blond hair. This little blond boy is a live wire.  Daniel Emilfork is also great as the evil scientist Krank. Dominique Pinon plays the clone sons of Krank; a group of idiots who argue about which of them was the original. Judith Vittet plays the young orphan girl Miette, who develops a crush on the giant One. This aspect of the film may be unsettling for some viewers since the attachment of Miette and One is almost romantic and almost seductive but it never crosses the line. This would be consistent with Freudian theory that indicates that sexuality is a life development phenomena and doesn't spring forth magically when a child reaches puberty.

In regard to style, I found Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's esthetic approach to be most like American director, Tim Burton. If you like the visual feast of a Tim Burton film, you will like The City of Lost Children. Jean Paul Gauthier's costumes were great, never over the top or the center of attention, but always unique and in keeping with the darkness of the film. The film may be watched in the original French, or with English subtitles, or dubbed. I recommend it for the film esthetics and unique storytelling.",1294617600,2,2918,4.673151750972763

It's anything but common and certainly something that you will find memorable for years to come.

I remember when I first watched it, on video (that's VHS for anyone under 26) seeing Gilliam's seal of approval. If Gilliam likes it, then I am sold. And it was an EXPERIENCE. Now everyone knows Ron Pearlman as Hellboy. Great stuff. And his first outing with Del Torro (Cronos) is coming out soon on hi def. But look at him here! My god! It is a crime of sorts that this was not the first film considered for hi-def treatment. It is the tab in the binder that has written ""Film"". It is dreamlike. It is even about that.

Brilliant, dark and surreal French/Spanish/German Science Fiction Fantasy for adults from directors Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro who did the equally bizarre but great ""Delicatessen"".

The excellent spotlighted customer review lists some that came to my mind too: Fritz Lang, Freud, Carl Jung, Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Jean Cocteau, the Brothers Quay. I'll add Jules Verne and Fellini. OK, Roger Ebert mentioned Verne. (Ebert is a national treasure.) But what to make of it? ""The City of Lost Children"" is mostly a visual trip and less any sort of interesting tale that begs being deciphered. Read into it what you will, if you feel the desire to do so.

The more I watched the more I became engrossed in the characterization and yes - the beautiful, yet dull use, of reds and greens in the imagery. Ultimately, its plot is unforgettable and mesmerizing, but Ron Perlman's attempt at speaking French is a little bothersome and weird. It made me wonder if they made him a slow, lovable brute only after they heard him speak the language. Nevertheless, he doesn't speak as much as I'd thought he would and his acting is still wonderful and well-placed for this film.

788977,3,6304083149,"I don't know what to think of this movie.  The idea sounded interesting, a man who cannot dream taking children from the city so he can dream, but I spent the first 45 minutes of the movie trying to figure out what the heck is going on.  Even after watching it, I still have no clue.heh.

All I can say is this movie is messed up. LOL.  There were a lot of parts of the movie I didn't understand, what was up with the women twins (were they running a thieving ring made up of children?).  Then there is the scene portraying a church and its congregation in some metallic looking warehouse all wearing eye pieces (they are referred to in the movie as Cyclops, but what were they?).  The odd man stealing all the children and his weird family (composed of a few clones, an odd-looking woman, and a brain encased in a box filled with liquid and a megaphone so it can ""speak"").

This movie was a mix of plots all jumbled together and here's the movie for you!  There was no coherent plot-line that I could easily follow and that added to my confusion and not understanding what was going on.  I suppose it's appropriate to portray in a strange, surreal dream-like quality in keeping with the story in the movie, that of a man who can't dream.

Oh well, it is crazy, confusing, disturbing, vivid, and just what you'd imagine your dream or nightmare would look like if put to film.  IMO, I didn't think the movie was that great, I thought it a little weird, but if you're still curious just rent it.",1212364800,4,1493,4.33453237410072
788978,4,6304083149,"The City of Lost Children (Cite des enfants perdus) is perhaps the most visually striking film I have ever seen. The film is also one of the most difficult but with patience the careful viewer will be rewarded. Directed by Jeunet and Caro the film is a fairy tale for adults. It is an exploration of the idea of innocence. The innocence of a child and the innocence of a childlike adult.

In a magical world a scientist (Daniel Emilfork) who cannot dream on his own is kidnapping children and stealing their dreams. One of the children that is kidnapped is the little brother of a circus strongman, One (Ron Perlman. The film is a quest for One to recover his lost brother. Along the way he meets Miette (Judith Vittet)a nine year old girl wise beyond her years. Together they brave the strange and mythical world of the City of Lost Children to recover the brother.

The above is an extremely simplified version of the plot. This is a film that begs to be seen. The visuals created by Jean Rebasse are truly stunning as are the costumes of Jean-Paul Gaultier. The film needs to be watched carefully. I will admit it took several viewings before I understood what was going on. Watch it for the visuals and the story will begin to emerge. Don't miss the chance to see one of the most astounding French films of the last decade.

Reading the review by herstory and her pathetically ignorant ""It should have been made in America"" statement angered me enough to write my first review of this since I saw it in the theater 10 years ago.  Being from the states, I'm ashamed at the level of ignorant ethno-centrism prevalent among many from the US. I absolutely love this movie as it is unmatched in artistic vision, unless of course you count Gilliam, Burton, and Jackson (Heavenly Creatures before LOTR).

Admittedly, I didn't fully appreciate this movie the first time.  After the third of fourth viewing, the story began to make much more sense.  Most negative reviews have noted that there are holes in the plot, but I strongly disagree.  Give it a few more viewings and I'm sure you will agree that the open-ended aspects are much more intentional that you previously thought.

789019,3,6304083149,"Clearly influenced by Gilliam's Brazil, The City of Lost Children is undeniably gorgeous to watch (especially on an upgraded HDMI DVD system). Shot entirely in studio, the attention to detail in all locations from the Dickensian style city to Krank's gothic lair is phenominal. The acting too, most notably from 9 year-old Judith Vittet as Miette - the leader of the orphans, and from everyone's favourite neanderthal Ron Perlman, is outstanding.

Why then only three stars? Because, in my humble opinion, almost two hours was far too long to drag out this basically simple fable about good and bad, exploitation of the innocent and the quest for lost youth (a la recherche...?). I'm sure I will not be the only one to feel that the stunning sets sometimes take precedence over the plot.

I enjoyed it the first time through. Will probably skim through it again to wallow in the sumptuous detail and skillfully choreographed scenes with the ""octopus"", but doubt if I could sit through the entire movie again without a yawn or two.

A few extras add value to the DVD, most notably a ""making of"" and ""behind the scenes"" which give away some of the clever special effects. I wonder why co-director Marc Caro refused to participate in the documentaries though - was he on the verge of doing an Alan Smithee?

Finally a note about the dubbing. I started with the English version, but found the dubbed voices to be very poorly lip-synched and with irritatingly inappropriate accents - most notably Pinon's that sounded impossibly aristocratic! I therefore switched to the original French with English subtitles and would certainly recommend that as the preferred audio option.",1174953600,,1670,4.953571428571428

789025,5,6304083149,"This film is barly a science fiction film, it's more of a hodge podge of fantasy, old monster movies and fairy tales with many dream and surreal sequances.. City of Lost Children is more like the Wizard of Oz than like the Matrix, but is still dipped in enough science fiction jucies to suit my tastes. The plot revolves around a mad scientist, Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who lives off the coast of a surreal Dickensian French city in an old oil rig.

Krank does not have the ability to dream, and as a result he is prematurely old. In order to supplement his dream deficit, Krank kidnaps young children in order to study and extract their dreams. Unfortunately for Krank this is a self-fulfilling curse, as the experience of being kidnapped is so traumatic that the children have only nightmares.

In pursuit of this scheme, Krank employs a sinister cult of blind men called ""Cyclops"" to perform the kidnappings.

In return for giving up their sight, the cult's neophytes are given a mechanical ""third eye"" and a device which makes their hearing unnaturally sensitive. This augmentation is as much a curse as it is a boon; at one point the audience may witness the discomfort of one Cyclops listening to Denree chomp his food.

It is revealed that Krank is an artificially created man with superior intelligence. He was created by an inventor who also created six clones, a wife for himself (who later betrayed him), and a migraine-ridden brain in a jar named Irvin for him to interact with. Irvin's voice is supplied by Jean-Louis Trintignant; the Inventor and his clones are all played by Dominique Pinon.

The events of the film open with a sideshow strongman named One (Ron Perlman of hellboy fame) witnessing an orphan he cares for, named Denree (Joseph Lucien), being kidnapped by Krank's Cyclops. It later turns out that Denree is a special child, one able to provide Krank with the ability to overcome his condition (due to the fact that Denree has no sense of fear). One sets out to find and rescue his ""little brother"", with help of a nine-year-old street urchin girl named Miette (Judith Vittet) who holds the screen like no other child actress that I've seen.

Also in the film are a pair of Siamese twins known as ""The Octopus"". They run a thieves' guild in which they train and force orphans (one of whom is Miette) to steal for them. Due to unforseen circumstances, One gets caught up in a the theft of a large safe (which only he can carry). The end result of which is the orphans' failure to completely empty the safe.

 Annoyed with this failure and Miette's subsequent decision to run off with One (Miette is their best thief) the Octopus seeks to destroy them. To this end they attempt to secure help from their former sideshow employer, whose trained fleas can inject poison into a person's scalp, inducing the victim to commit acts of violence when the flea-master plays his barrel organ and his scenes are the best in the movie.

Directed by the french duo of Jeunet & Caro who also did the yummy canniable flick ""Delicatessen"" (Jeunet later did Alien Reserection and the french film ""Amelie"") The story telling is wonderful the direction is flawless and the special effects are some of the best you could ever see in the mid 90's cinima. I don't know any one who has seen this film that doen't love it on some level. Yes, there are some confussing elements to it and takes some weird turns but this movie with all it's layers forces the movie goer to fill in the blanks and think outside the box to fully understand the complexites of this film...I've seen it a dozen times and I'm almost there!",1172361600,7,3618,4.640625

789101,3,6304083149,"I had been dancing around this French film (with subtitles) for several months, unsure how I would react to it, but I finally took the plunge and booked my passage to The City of Lost Children (La Cit des enfants perdus).  Now I could sit here and ooh and aah all over the place about how beautiful and original this film is, but I have to give it to you straight: the story is almost completely illogical.  This is one of your ""most of what I learned about the film came from reading the plot summary"" kind of movie.  It's fascinating in its dark, fantastical way, of course, but I would really have liked to have a plot I could follow.  The setting is unworldly - it's like they put Tim Burton, a couple of anime directors, Charles Dickens, and scores of German expressionists in a locked room and forced them to collaborate on the design of this world.  Fortunately, the film does have one saving grace - young Judith Vittet.  Not only does she turn in a masterful performance, she's the only buoy of sanity I could find in this ocean of craziness.

Basically, the film is about this strange man who steals children, hooks them up to machines, and steals their dreams because he is incapable of dreaming himself.  His entourage consists of a number of annoying clones and a small army of humanoids who look like they're in the early stages of assimilation by the Borg.  I don't understand why they depend on technology to see and hear, but I suspect it's just an excuse for the director to give us night-vision type shots every so often when they're out on the hunt for new little dreamers.  At the same time, you also have a pair of Fagin-like Siamese twins running a racket of child thieves all over town.  One of these kids, Miette (Vittet), teams up with One (Ron ""The Beast"" Perlman), a strongman who is desperate to save his little brother from the clutches of the dream-stealing guy.  Along the way to that end, this unlikely duo encounters an underwater diver, trained fleas, and all sorts of weirdness.

The relationship between One and Miette is really the heart of the story.  One (Perlman), I should mention, seems to be somewhat mentally challenged, making Miette the true grown-up in the relationship.  Theirs is a bond much like an older brother to a younger sister, but I'm one of those who felt that the relationship really walked a fine line between something wholesome and something a little beyond the pale.  They never crossed the line, mind you, but this part of the story may be suggestive to some viewers.

There is, fittingly enough, a dream-like character to the cinematography and story presentation - and, perhaps in that sense, it's OK that the plot doesn't always make sense.  A tighter story line, though, would undoubtedly have made this otherwise lush and intriguing film more successful.  I'm all for suspending my disbelief, but I really need to know what I'm suspending it for.  The City of Lost Children, with its eye-catching visuals and superb soundtrack, is almost the total package - all it lacks is a more lucid plot.",1161129600,8,3062,4.635185185185185

However, not long after the movie began i was already checking my watch, which is never a good sign.  As visually interesting as the story was, i don't believe there are any interesting nor sympathetic characters.  Each role is sorta thrown at the viewer without much rhyme or reason, and none end up as being particularly interesting.  Sure, the sets are both blaring and mysterious, simultaneously evoking a mid-century cartoon and a noirish caper flick.  The problem is that the story around the interesting visuals is... well... not very interesting.  Realizing this is fantasy, i won't mention a dozen plot-holes large enough to sail a mine through, nor will I kvetch about the empty lack of any meaningful purpose for the goings-on that contribute to the lack of identifying with any of the characters.

789103,5,6304083149,"""The City Of Lost Children"" is an excellent and outstanding film. However, it will not appeal to all audiences. I admit the first time I viewed the film, I liked it, but I was not a huge fan of it. But on subsequent viewings I found it to be a great film. The film itself is in French, with subtitles. However, there is an English language section for those who prefer it in English. I myself prefer the French with English subtitles. If you like films with outstanding visuals, look no further, this film has it all. The surrealism in the film must have been a cinematographers and special effects persons dream come true. And although Ron Perlman and cast did an excellent acting job, the kudos in this film belongs to the set designers who must have had a field day with this one.

Although I continually find myself looking at the visuals when I view the film, the story itself is rather unique. It centers on a mad scientist named Krank who cannot dream; and therefore snatches the dreams of little children. [And the children in the film do a superb acting job too!] The film is very moody; but as I wrote earlier it is very surrealistic, therefore, the tone of the film is established by the visuals the viewer sees. The viewer sees the dreamy and nightmare world in which the film takes place, which is also about dreams and nightmares. Ron Perlman stars as a circus strongman who searches the city [City of Lost Children] in search of his missing adopted brother. He is simple minded, which is important to the story, because it is due to his simple-mindedness that the children in the city are able to trust him, and later help him. This is due to the fact the children feel comfortable with him: As the adults in the film are not to be trusted. And for good reason.

The little brother has been abducted by a group of evil-doers known as Cyclops. These Cyclops work for a mad scientist known as Krank. Krank cannot dream, and he tries to steal the dreams of little children. Due to a curse placed on Krank, he cannot dream. Because of the curse, Krank ages quickly, and therefore needs the dreams of children in order to stop aging. He also has a midget for a wife, and seven sons [identical] who ALL have sleeping disorders. The film is difficult to follow the first time you view it, and will require subsequent viewings. But it is well worth the extra viewings. In fact, I view it once in awhile and always find something different, or something I didn't notice before. This is a very good film. However, it will not appeal to all audiences. I believe the film is great. But, as a word of caution, this is a film which may not appeal to many viewers. Therefore, rent it first.

789105,2,6304083149,"One (Perlman), a circus strongman of Baltic origin, loses his manager to a gang of child thieves, and Pipo (Faesch), his little brother, to a gang of child-stealers. He joins forces with Miette (Vitette), one of the gang of child pickpockets, in order to find his lost brother, and in the process rescue Miette from the wicked Siamese twins that mastermind her gang.

This film has so much potential. Why it denigrated into the sordid story it did in its second half (more on that later), I cannot fathom. Some of the characters, while weirdly surreal and bizarre, are remarkable. There's the Cyclops gang, roaming the streets of the eternally dimly lit city, admonishing the citizens to renounce their sight and obtain the enlightenment of the blind. The Siamese twin masterminds are both amusing, as well as a little frightening. There is the former master of the flea circus, who now uses his fleas to perform assassinations. Then there is Krank, the evil genius who cannot dream, and who feeds, vampire like, on the dreams of the children he abducts, and the odd motley-crew of clones, genetic anomalies and bodiless brains that make up his entourage. It's a fairy tale in film noire. It's a visual delight, and an enjoyable trip.

Enjoyable until we sort out what's between One and Miette - the 40-year-old man and the 10-year-old girl become lovers. Granted, Miette initiates the whole thing, but this just seems pedophiliac fantasy on the part of the writer. While no actual physical sexual contact occurs onscreen, there is enough implied that one just feels beat over the head with it. The scene where Miette climbs the ladder toward the end of the film, with One closely behind and smiling inanely as he looks up her skirts, is a case in point. Also, the scene where Miette proposes marriage to One, who agrees to wait for the day she is old enough to marry (consummate?). While some have pointed out that One's restraint in waiting until that day to enage in full blown sexual intercourse shows proper behaviour, they're oddly overlooking the fact that there is no doubt of sexual longing for someone who is only a child. There are enough loving, longing looks exchanged to drive the point home without question. Having thorougly enjoyed the film up to this point, I spent the remainder thoroughly loathing it, and many scenes and interactions between the two protagonists literally made my jaw drop. It's positively vile.

There are other issues that make this film unsuitable for children, namely that there is a tremendous amount of violence directed AT children. Above and beyond Krank, whose harm is mostly of the psychological variety, there are the Siamese twins who try to have the girl drowned, and One - while under the influence of the mind-controlling fleas - who beats the little girl bloody, while she protests passively and helplessly all along (more of that pedophiliac fantasy, but of the violent sort). Not something to give children pleasant dreams, to be sure.",1153699200,13,2991,4.883858267716535
789106,5,6304083149,"When first viewing the movie I was originally a little takin aback.  The movie starts off bizarre and gets worst.  However it is an incredible movie.  The world follows it's own twisted logic which enchants the viewer and draws them deeper into the director's vision.  The movie starts off with the main character One and his young companion.  Shortly the companion gets takin and One starts off in search of his young friend.  He goes deeper and deeper into a strange and twisted world where he meets a young girl of about nine, a couple of evil twins, a gang of cyclopse, a group of clones, and a floating brain in a tank of green water.

  In the end it turns out his friend has been kidnapped by an evil scientist who cannot dream.  Consequently he steals the dreams of young children so he can sleep.

  The entire movie combines to create a sort of fairly tale nightmare.  It combines otherworldly beauty with twisted evil to create a haunting dreamscape.  Overall this movie is a must see.",1139356800,8,996,4.548022598870056
789107,5,6304083149,"Nice to know that Terry Gilliam is a fan and supporter of directors Caro and Jeunet because one thinks immediately of his masterpiece, Brazil when watching this visual phantasmagoria.  There's the same sense of cracked, obsessive, over-the-top visual inventiveness where everything familiar is suddenly unfamiliar. There is also an overpowering sense of place, the directors have created a world and we are consumed by it. (Why all the hand-wringing about the budget on this one? It was shot for $18 million and looks like it cost 4X that much.)

Lost Children is every bit as dark as Brazil, but there's a sweetness also, mostly emanating from the friendship between One, Ron Perlman, and Miette, Judith Vittet. Perlman is perfect, able to communicate more with a nod of his head than most actors can with a well crafted speech. Miette is an ideal foil for him and Ms. Vittet brings extraordinary assurance to the part. In a film of bizarre, often hilarious excess, their relationship is treated with quiet delicacy, providing a welcome ray of hope.

According to the commentary, Daniel Emilfork, Krank, was no pleasure on the set, but his performance is brilliant. The further into this dream you dig, the odder it gets.  A midget, clones, a toxic flea, a cult of blind men, the truly wonderful Siamese twins - (one puffs on a cigarette, the other blows out smoke), a brain in a fish tank, musical steps that play an organ when walked on. This is a lovingly crafted film, one could watch it over and over and still see things for the first time.

This is the type of film I can watch over and over again, because of that essence of uniqueness and mastery in film-making.

The acting also was pretty poor by many of the main actors which caused the story to drag even more.

The people are a big part of it. The evil twins (they're both evil), the cyclops crew, Bismuth, and especially Krank, they are all comic-book exaggerations but also real actors. The city is a maze of alleys filled with grit and smog, stairs, and bridges (over what?) - another big part of the atmosphere. The gadgetry goes over the top, somewhere between steam-punk and tech noir, with a menacing complexity that would have Tim Burton sobbing in envy. The rubbery nightmare sequences are good, but serve mostly to focus attention on camera work elsewhere that distorts scenes to ominous effect. There are some amusing moments - the best is near the end, a roller-coaster ride of cause and effect, triggered by a teardrop.

That's about it, really - an amazing visual experience, like the dark side of a comic book, but done brilliantly.

789167,5,6304083149,"Krank is an evil, created being who uses the Cyclops to kidnap children for him so that he can steal their dreams.  Intrigued yet?  One is the strongman at a street sideshow, who has adopted a street urchin as his younger brother, Denree.  One is not much more than an adult child himself, having a simple brain, and when Denree is taken by the Cyclops, One must find him.

One finds himself tangled up with a band of street kids, thieves and pickpockets, who are enslaved by Siamese twins named la Pieuvre.  He manages to enlist the help of Miette, one of the older girls in the gang.  If you boiled the movie down to basics, it would be One and Miette looking for Denree, but City Of Lost Children is not a simple movie.

'City' is a complex and sometimes confusing film, but is so richly done and bizarrely plotted that it is entertainment at its surreal finest.  Krank (Daniel Emilfork) was created, along with his 'brother', Irvin, who is nothing more than a brain in a green tinged fishtank.  His 'mother' is a midget, and his 'brothers', five clones (all played by talented Dominique Pinon) wait on him hand and foot.  Krank and his strange entourage live on a dark and creepy platform out in the ocean, surrounded by mines that protect them.

Back in the squalor of the city, One and Miette are pursued by the greedy la Pieuvre, who winds out utilizing the resources from her old circus days, a worn out opium addict with an amazing flea circus.  His fleas are trained to inject a poison into targets, the fluid being activated when an old hand-cranked music box is played.  And Miette winds out meeting a strange, fanatical man who lives underwater, salvaging treasures from the sea floor.

There are many, many fantastical things for you to see in this film, but I have a few words of caution before you begin.  First of all, this is a French film, and the dialogue is French.  I strongly recommend watching the movie in the original dialogue with English subtitles, rather than watching the dubbed version.  You will loose a lot of emotion in the inadequately dubbed voices.

Don't expect feats of FX either.  City Of Lost Children has the feel of a play, using expert sets and backdrops, and winds out being a visually stunning treat with good, old fashioned sets rather than a lot of CGI.  The costumes are marvelous, the photography is stunning (note:  Daniel Emilfork is rather evil looking anyway, with his bald head, large nose, and large teeth, but the camera is utilized in a curved view to make him even more menacing) but the script is a little bit disjointed.  All of these features combined mark a distinctive feel of bizarreness throughout the entire film.

Also to note, there are a couple of amazing sequences in the film, one in which we follow the events caused by a single teardrop, and another where we follow the journey of a flea.

City Of Lost Children is a film only for those who enjoy a taste of the bizarre, love to stroke their fingers down the spine of the surreal, and believe that off-the-wall is a livable realm.  If this is you, then you will love this film as much as I did.  Enjoy!",1118707200,15,3126,4.527629233511586

It might be necessary to be a bit of a linguist to fully understand all of the subtleties in this film, but even if you're not, you should be able to understand something deeper is going on besides a ""weird"" or ""pretty"" movie.

One and Miette (a street wise orphan) set off an an adventure to leads them to Krank (whose name means 'sick' in German).

789200,5,6304083149,"The City of Lost Children gets two platinum stars and also moves up to one of my top ten favorite films of all time. This is a confusing story, from beginning to end it expands your mind, reaches into your nightmares, and creates a story that is part Dark City and part of a novel called ""The Golden Compass"" by Phillip Pullman.

Yes, this film was everything and more. Not only visually beautiful, but the creative and symbolic meaning of the actions and words of the characters are ""jaw dropping"". Also, there are so many sub-stories in this film that reminded me of the style that Run Lola Run was done. This is the style that due to a connection of unrelated events something extraordinary happens. Let me give you an example from this film: There is a scene where the girl and One (Ron Pearlman-also a very biblical name) are trying to escape from the two women who want their jewels. There are events that lead from a dog finding its female companion to a boat almost hitting/splitting the women in half. Wild coincidences...imagine this times ten, and you have this film.

Keep in mind this is a French film with English subtitles, so you are not only getting the true voice of the film, but seeing the darkness of the cinematography without any American input. This really shows the purpose behind making this film, it really takes you to a new place so dark and dreamlike that you the viewer actually feel like you are in the picture itself. A movie about dreams and nightmares that takes place in a world of dreams and nightmares.

The story centres around a mad scientist, Krank, who is unable to dream, because of this he is aging quickly and is old beyond his year. He grows insane and has developed a technique to view and capture children's dreams so he can thereby inject them into his own mind. He kidnaps children from the nearby village and brings them to his lair, a king of oilrig in the middle of surrounding sea. He is aided by his brothers who are four identical clones of each other, unfortunately they all suffer from narcolepsy. Krank himself is a clone. His father who created them is now merely a brain in a tank and Krank was an unfortunate mistake who doesn't dream. The only clone who was right is an enigma called the original who has long since escaped the insanity of this evil lair only to be living underwater and is kind of an insane junk collector. One day strong man, One (Ron Perlman), and his little brother are ambushed by Krank's men and One's little brother is kidnapped. Thus far Krank's captives have proved unsuccessful in his quest for a cure, because they all suffer terrible nightmares, partly due to his own nastiness. All One's little brother responds to is food, he seems to have no fear and it seems he could be the one, just as long as Krank keeps feeding him. One sets out on a quest to find his brother meeting Miete, a young a troublesome orphan girl in the process. It's all good fun this film and while the story is simplistic it's a kind of delightfully Grimm fairytale sort of story that keeps your interest.

The cast are great. Ron Perlman is one of those cult actors who everyone seems to like and he has hit it big with the recent success Hellboy. He is a strong presence and unlike many musclemen of his stature he can act, something which has held him back somewhat,is because people have never really cast him as a leading action man, although in truth he's not blessed with good looks. The interestingly named Rufus, a Juenet stalwart is also very good with the clones, while Daniel Emilfork is excellent as Crank. Also good and a charming innocence is Judith Vittet as Miette.

Anyone who loves a visually stunning movie should watch this film it looks amazing. The sets, the impressionistic and exaggerated designs are brilliant. It is typically French in it's verve. This is a fantasy fans wet dream, believe me! ****",1108512000,11,3891,4.5528571428571425

French duo Jeunet & Caro (Delicatessen) used their unparalleled film sorcery to create this haunting, dark fairytale of dread and longing, innocence and innocence lost. Krank, a sinister madman is stealing children to take their dreams, and One, child-like strongman, and Miette, young thief, nine going on too old, together face the perils of rescuing them.
Visually, City of Lost Children is a masterpiece. Its performances are universally superb, making singling out any particular one superfluous. Its score, composed by Angelo Badalamenti, is eerie, haunting, beautiful.
As the credits finally role to a close, the viewer feels that he has just awakened from an incredible, bizarre, frightening but amazing dream, with one difference; he can hit play and dream it again.

Though dark and perhaps somewhat disturbing because of how warped the graphics can be, it presents its audience with a circus of both crazy and endearing characters. An orphan girl who is tough as nails and a circus strong-man who is soft as a marshamllow take us on a wondrous journey in search of the city of lost children. There, orphans are taken hostage and their thoughts stolen by a mad scientist who is no longer able to dream.

The special effects and cinematography are so unique and effectual, it's like nothing I've ever seen. And though the dark, swimming and quirky quality was engrossing to me, it made my roommate nauseaus.

For some it may be too weird to convey a poignant message, but ultimately its strangeness makes it more effectual as it demonastrates how the absence of childlike wonder can corrupt a mind, yet maintaining youth's optimism can set free the child in us all.",1105747200,4,1047,4.779005524861878
789203,5,6304083149,"A dark tale of a simple man whose young brother has been kidnapped by a madman who attempts to steal the dreams of children because he himself cannot dream.

This movie is like an even darker version of the ""Child Catcher"" character from the film ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" made a movie (I also kept expecting him to cameo).  It is a totally stylized, created world filled with dark fantasy imagery, a madman (Daniel Emilfork), silly clones (Dominique Pinon), orphan thieves, evil conjoined twins (Genevieve Brunet & Odile Mallet), mechanically altered religious fanatics, poison carrying fleas, and the notion that a tear can cause a shipwreck and save two lives.  It also has one of the most disturbing openings I have ever seen (it involves Santa so be prepared for another childhood memory to be flushed down the toilet of life).  Dark, unsettling, twisted, to the point of almost defying the ability of description, yet also touchingly beautiful in it's portrayal of the spiritual nature and devotion of unrelated people who become family.

Ron Perlman has the male lead, a circus strongman named One, who's three year old adopted brother Denree (Joseph Lucien) is kidnapped.  Innocence is tough to pull off.  Most actors come across looking stupid and that's not the same thing.  The character of One isn't bright but he's also not stupid.  Simple, yes, but that's also different.  It's fine lines and Ron Perlman does a great job walking those subtleties and capturing innocence.

The nine year old female lead, Miette (Judith Vittet), an orphan thief who helps One, has the look of youthful, lovely adulthood and the attitude of a child who has had no childhood.  A great, character defining moment is when she is being carried on One's back and tries on an earring and checks herself out in a mirror.  A telling juxtaposition of ""father/daughter"" and ""blossoming woman"" imagery.

Perlman and Vittet have lovely screen chemistry.  The spiritual connection that develops between their characters is the beating heart of this film.

Favorite line(s):  ""Does it hurt?"" (asked of a woman with a metal arrow through her body)  ""Yes. I'm allergic to steel.""

Favorite line spoken by Ron Perlman: ""After I heard them sing (whales), I always always missed target (harpooning them).""

Mix these colorful characters in with a band of homeless, criminal children a la Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist style, pet fleas that inject drugs, a talking brain in a tank named Uncle Irvin, a midget named Mademoiselle Bismuth and her six cloned sons, and finally a group of blind people called Cyclops who eat children and you have a marvelous mixture of fantasy, horror, sci-fi, comedy, action & adventure all rolled into one strangely odd film.

One of the main problems that I had with this movie were precisely because of the creativity; the story moves quickly, and because so much of it is so new, I was often confused about many things.  I would even suggest reading a partial plot summary of it before you've seen it, so you have some idea of what's going on, because otherwise it can be a confusing experience.
Of course, I'm sure that if I watched the movie again I would understand much more of it in hindsight. However, I'm not sure that I would want to watch this movie again. Despite being extremely well directed and filmed, it sits heavy on the soul, and I'm pretty sure that certain scenes from it will find a way to get into my dreams and turn them into nightmares (just like a recurrent theme in the movie).  It doesn't really have what one would call a happy ending, either.
Another note; the version that I saw was dubbed in English, and while most of the voice acting was fairly good, I didn't think that Myet's English voice really fit her character.

789293,5,6304083149,"Jeunet and Caro are at their best in that bleak world that looks like some Enki Bilal's comic book for children. Everything is dark, sombre, sad and torturous. Human beings are grotesque monsters without any soul and without any morality. This world is dominated by a Mad Scientist who has cloned everything into multiple copies and is trying to appropriate and possess children's dreams in his violently nightmarish mind. He captures and kidnaps children to plug them on his sarcophagi in order to predate and devour their minds. The world around is not better. It is a whole set of ignominous beings who exploit children in order to skim the world of all that can be stolen or borrowed for an unpredictable and unspecified length of time. The siamese sisters meet with an end that is the righteous peak of their career. The mad scientist vanishes into thin fire caused by multiple sticks of dynamite. The cloning of Father Christmas ad infinitum is funnier than the antics of some clown in a circus. The virtual adventures of the little girl are frightening and reassuring : there may be some good genius and nice wizard behind the wings of this crazy world. And it all ends well, though we had imagined a more dramatic and catastrophic closure of this vision of hell. Beware of the demented ship, the soulless Flying Dutchman that loses all sanity and runs into the setting. I particularly loved the predating perambulating insects who manage to travel at High Speed by using some mammals, including some humans, to transfer from one place to the next like a monstrous TGV (Train  Grande Vitesse, pardon me for my French). This film is not to be shown to fragile minds, particularly adults who think the world is beautiful and hope life remains that way, but to be entrusted to children who want to have dynamic dreams that give them very strong and intense emotions.

789337,5,6304083149,"If you like traditional Bad Boys II kinds of movies, with simple to follow, slam-bam action, you probably won't dig City of Lost Children. However, if you have an appreciation for unique cinematic style and stories that stray from the norm (and I really mean stray), this is probably going to float your boat.
The story is as follows, (I swear I'm not giving anything away either)...a circus strongman and an orphan girl team up to rescue a young boy who's been kidnapped by this futuristic religious cult called the Cyclops. They've intentionally blinded themselves and attached cyborg-like eye cameras so that they may ""see God"" better.
The Cyclops regularly kidnap children and take them to an evil madman whose accomplices include a 3 foot tall woman, 4 cloned dimwitted servants and a talking brain. (You heard me right.) The evil madman tries to tap into these children's dreams so that he may try and gain a soul.
Ok, if you're still reading this, clearly your intrigued. It's hard to describe the look and feel of this movie. It's got a little of everything, sci-fi, fantasy, drama, and comedy. It's dark and light at the same time. Sci-fi action enthusiasts should know that this really doesn't have a lot of action, so don't expect gunplay and martial arts, it's just not that type of movie.
The real reason to see this movie is for the cinematic style and visuals. Word to the wise, the only similarity between this and Amelie are these two reasons. Amelie is a much lighter feeling movie overall, so there are bound to be a few people who loved Amelie, but do not like City of Lost Children and perhaps vice versa. (And you will notice some of the same actors in both movies as well.)
In the end, I found the movie to be a delightful change from the norm, with a storyline that seemed both fairy-tale like and surreal and characters that you truly enjoyed watching as much for their acting abilities as for the fact that Jeunet has a knack for casting some of the most visually captivating actors I've seen.

I purchased this region 1 version because it has two different screen ratios (4:3 and 1.85:1) on opposite sides of the DVD. It also has dubbed English and original French audio which was not available on the region 4 (Australian) version in my own country. I particularly wanted this version so I could choose how I wanted to play it as I do with other DVDs.
I was warned when placing my order that this version would not play on many multi-region players due to new copy protection schemes, however I found that I had no problem running it on our two stand alone multi region DVD players (OMNI SL-P3102S and Diamond DVD-101D), and also a Lite-On PC DVD drive which was region patched in firmware and software. The DVD would not play on an unmodified region 4 Playstation 2.
As for the movie, what more can I say... it's a cult classic and I enjoyed listening to the directors commentary for the first time. I look forward to playing it many more times in different formats, with the freedom of selecting screen ratio and audio options of MY choice.

The film paints a very dark and surrealistic picture centered around a man named Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who is unable to dream, but kidnaps young children to steal their dreams within a bizarre laboratory.  Unfortunately for Krank, the children are so frightened by him that they only dream nightmares.  Krank himself is the creation of a mad scientist (Dominique Pinon, who played Joseph in ""Amlie""), who also created six clones of himself.  He also placed the brain of his Uncle Irvin into a tank to keep him alive (the voice of Jean-Louis Trintignant).  The children are kidnapped for Krank by an army of Cyclops henchmen under the control of Cyclops Leader Gabriel Marie (Serge Merlin, who played Raymond Dufayel in ""Amlie""), the clones and Mademoiselle Bismuth (Mireille Moss).  When the child Denree (Joseph Lucien) is kidnapped, a very strong, former whale-harpooner named One (Ron Perlman), who regards Denree as his little brother, sets out to find him.  Along the way, One meets and is assisted by the young Miette (Judith Vittet), an orphan who, along with other orphans, steals valuables for a set of Siamese twins (Genevive Brunet and Odile Mallet).  The orphans are highly reminiscent of those from Charles Dickens' serial novel ""Oliver Twist"" (1837-1839), but the Siamese twins are far more ruthless than Dickens' character of Fagin.
""The City of Lost Children"" earned no Oscar nominations, but did receive several nominations for the French Csar Awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music Written for a Film.  The film did win the Csar Award for Best Production Design.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet and co-director Marc Caro also received a nomination for the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival.
Memorable scenes in the film include the children dreaming of multiple Santa Clauses, the Cyclops henchmen at work, the Cyclops cult gathering, Miette and One over the water, the discussions with Uncle Irvin, and Miette's dream.  The dark and mysterious set designs and cinematography are superb and elegantly demonstrate the clarity and depth of color that Jean-Pierre Jeunet later improved upon with ""Amlie"".

789400,4,6304083149,"this is one of my favorite films of all time.  it has a fascinating, intricate and detailed story, and a huge cast of characters and ideas.  the film presents a dreamworld in which nothing is as it seems.  a mysterious cult insists that followers blind themselves to see the truth.  some children have adult personalities, and some adults have childlike personalities.  a  mad scientist operates a sinister laboratory on a platform in the city's bay.  children from the city are disappearing, and the answer to these mysteries is so exquisitely, uniquely and poignantly rendered that i observed people emerging from the theatre with tears in their eyes.  if only i had brought an eyedropper, i found myself thinking...
that said, if  the viewer does not pay very close attention, they may lose the plot thread and will say the film makes no sense, or is boring.  note also that it will not answer every question for you.  some aspects are indeed left enigmatic.  pay very close attention as you watch.  be sure to watch the letterbox version, and select the original french language with subtitles.
as far as the dvd is concerned, it looks good, but still i was disappointed.  having seen the film in the theatre three times, i was fairly well acqainted with its english translation.  in the theatre, the translation may not have been perfect, but it serves the film well enough.  for the home video release, an incompetent english dub was created, that seems to place matching the movements of the actors' mouths above providing a faithful translation.  the english voice performances are inferior, and some aspects of the dialogue are clouded.  much, much worse, the english subtitles in the home video release are not the subtitles that accompanied the film in the theatre; the english subtitles on the dvd are an incompetent transcription of the english dub!  this makes the film significantly more difficult to follow.  for example, in one of the more egregious failures, a character in the english dub says ""fleakins!""  What do the english subtitles say?  ""..the beacons!""  i should have known we were in trouble when i noticed that one of the director's names (jeunet) is misspelled in the menu (juenet)!  also, important text (eg, newspaper headlines) is not translated at all.
if you ever have the opportunity to see this incredibly unique and beautiful film in a theatre, i highly recommend it.  it is a five star film with a flawed dvd presentation.",1047513600,65,2460,4.898305084745763
789401,5,6304083149,"If you were to combine elements of Fritz Lang, Carl Jung, Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Jean Cocteau, the Brothers Quay, Ken Russel and Edgar Varese, you might approximate what Caro, Jeunet and company have created.
  These creative geniuses take you the audience into the innermost and darkest recesses of your Freudian Id. It is a place where nightmares of the most disturbing order reside, a place, as the movie's tag line promises, ""Where happily ever after is just a dream.""
  If you can't figure out what is going on, it's OK. The lead actor, Ron Perlman, admits in the director/actor voice-over that is included as a DVD extra, that he didn't have a clue what Jeunet was up to the entire time they were filming. Jeunet, in fact wanted to keep his cast unsettled and in the dark, and a dark place it is indeed.
  One aspect of the film that is particularly unsettling involves a scene in which several of the very young cast members are almost frightened to death by the grotesque-looking Krank (Daniel Emilfork) dressed in a Santa costume, along with one of his clone henchmen/brothers, (le scaphandrier/les clones) played by the late Dominique Pinon. Then again, on the director's voice-over, Jeunet reveals he had to cut a scene from an early segment in the movie, because the kid involved became ""too frightened."" I don't know if I, for one, could have handled that one, even for the sake of art.
  This is obviously not a kid's fairy tale, nor is it a kid's movie. It's a genuine nightmare, but not without its share of Grand Guignol humor. All the villains, and even the hero, One, (Ron Perlman in another highly idiosyncratic role), are groteques. The only characters approaching normal are the children. In that respect, the movie is a reflection of how all children sometimes see the world of adults through the filtering lens of their active imaginations. Jeunet wants us to see that world from a similar perspective.
  The cast is uniformly excellent. The young actress playing Miette (Judith Vittet) is personable and beautiful. The kid who plays One's little brother is real little character.  Jeunet comments that the very young cast members presented some unique directing challenges (the little boy wouldn't keep his eyes closed when he was supposed to fall asleep, for instance).  The cinematographer is a genius. Lighting, sound, DVD quality, all top notch.
 Another plus is that there are several English/French language combinations so you can watch it dubbed, subtitled, or in the original language. It's such a unique and captivating movie that I tried it in all three modes. If your French is limited, as mine is, I would suggest watching it in French with English subtitles, as the actors voices in the English dub version do not measure up to the originals (particularly jarring is the actor who dubs in Pinon's characters).
  If you don't mind mythology of the dark, disturbing variety and enjoy visually-creative, original film making, by all means check this one out.",1045267200,203,2998,4.897233201581027
789402,5,6304083149,"City of Lost Children (Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, 1995)
Jean-Pierre Jeunet is an astounding talent, one of Belgium's true living treasures. Along with his longtime collaborator Marc Caro, he's created two of the finest films of the nineties, Delicatessen and City of Lost Children. The former is a comedic nightmare, the latter a nightmarish comedy. It's a subtle difference, but an important one. You're more likely to be laughing out loud at Delicatessen most of the time.
The story is complex and surreal, and certainly too twisted to relate here. The basic plot is that an old scientist (Daniel Emilfork, likely best remembered by American audiences from Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?), in his quest for youth, has taken up kidnapping children and stealing their dreams. While doing so, he chances to take Denree, the little brother of partially retarded sideshow strongman One (Ron Perlman, recently in Blade II). One, along with Denree's best friend Mariette (the charming, sassy Judith Vittet) sets off on a quest to discover the location of the scientist's secret hideout. There is much more to it than this, of course...
The thing about Jeunet's films that makes them sit apart from the rest of the world is his use of weird cinematographic quirks. Everything in Jeunet's earlier films is dark, smoggy, with a weird amber sheen overlaid. Natural light is some fabled creation that the characters may have at one point heard about, but it's obvious they've never experienced it. The effect is that of a film like Metropolis or Bladerunner, but the viewer doesn't have to strain his eyes so much. The overall effect is that the images in some way match the weird dada quality of the screenplay; it's as if the filmmakers are drawing you into the realm of the weird subconsciously as well as throwing plots at you that no normal human being could ever conceive. He also takes pains to cast odd-looking characters, and when they're less than odd-looking, uses hair and costume styling to make them odd. (I doubt anyone who ever sees this film will be able to watch Ron Perlman as a tough guy again without thinking of this hairdo.)
There is not a step made wrong here. Unlike Delicatessen, which leavens the surreal atmosphere with constant doses of black humor, City of Lost Children is almost relentless in creating its veil of disturbance. The humor to be found herein is always close to that hysterical edge, and often plunges well over the line. The effect is that of looking at the wreck of a glass train through binoculars; the accident itself isn't enough, all the gory details are revealed for your viewing endurement.
The film became a cult hit almost immediately upon release, and fans of dark film who have somehow never seen this before are likely to recognize a lot of films that have come since on which it has been an obvious influence (Alex Proyas' Dark City, in retrospect, wears its Jeunet and Caro-loving heart on its sleeve in many, many ways).

On the one hand, the relationship between One and Miette is beautifully wrought, the sets and art direction are fabulous, the evil Siamese twin sisters are deliciously over the top.  (Judith Vittet in the role of Miette is especially noteworthy in that she plays a strong, forceful child without a touch of saccharine.  Truly a great performance.)  And there is one sequence in which the power of a single tear in a sympathetic universe to stop evil is brilliantly played out.
On the other hand the central plot, a mad scientist who steals the dreams of children with a wife who is a midget and who has seven identical sons, is a terrible hash.  Who these people are, why they are the way they are, what their relation to their world is (for instance, where do they get the resources to buy stolen children?) is never addressed.

If you enjoy the work of Lynch, Gilliam etc, and indeed other Jeunet & Caro offerings, this wonderful film will also be for you.
At first, the experience is confusing and nightmarish, but so compelling. (After a second viewing I was in love!) You feel much better about the film when the pieces start to fit together, and then you can really get into all the positive, optimistic aspects of the story. The tender, heart warming friendship between the streetwise young orphan ""Miette"" and the gentle giant ""One"" is just delightful. All the characters are unusual and interesting, but the evil ""Krank"" is wickedly entertaining.
Angelo Badalamenti's score is hauntingly beautiful, and perfectly suited to this film. In view of his collaboration with David Lynch who also makes films that are dark but full of beauty, he was the only choice for this production.
The DVD package is pretty good with lots of extras.  The two most enjoyable and impressive features are the commentary, and the language selection, which has the options of French, English and Spanish soundtracks and subtitles.

It's twisted, yes, definitely dark, but it's NOT frighening in the least. The movie has a sense of humor that goes perfectly with its theme. Also, don't take it for some sci-fi action flick because it has the same director and two of the actors that all did Alien Resurrection. IT's COMPLETELY different.
I found this movie amazing! The effects were excellent, and the sets were bewildering in their attention to detail.
The actors were incredible! Dominique Pinon plays his (7) clones very well, and the guy playing Krank is perfect for the part - he has the mad scientist look, and he plays it like a master.
The characters in the Krank family brought back memories of playing the game Maniac Mansion. For those of you who've played it before, you may notice the similarities between the Kranks and the Edisons.
some of the characters were downright [messed] up though - like those siamese twins.... I didn't like her. But those Cyclops things... damn, those were weird. Cool idea though!
Everyone played their parts superbly, but I think the one who stole the show was the pretty little girl who played Miette. She has acting talent far beyond her age (which is now about 16 or 17, but at the time she couldn't have been older than 9 or 10). I forget her name though. Judith Vittot, I think.
I never would have pitted Ron Perlman for the part he plays - especially since the first movie I saw him (and Dominique Pinon as well) in was the ill-fated Alien Resurrection. Perlman's character in Alien 4 was the rude, obnoxious Johner. In COLC he plays a compassionate circus strongman with a child's mentality who wants to save his kidnapped ""little brother"" from Krank.
This film isn't for everyone. It's very artistic. Not a frantic action-packed flick or anything like that. It doesn't really fit into any particular genre, because it's just too different...P>This is a very, very good film, but not for all types!

789565,5,6304083149,"In watching Jeunet and Caro's film ""City Of Lost Children"" for the first time, I got lost, unable to find what the plotline was, and normally would have just given up if not for the dazzling setpieces and identifiable characters.  As I continued watching, the plot became more focused, while the story never lost focus and the scenery stayed sharp.  Even the ending stayed unknown as to who lives and who dies (at least for the most part).  The fact that I have seen it easily over 100 times now shows how fresh something can be putting together all the parts that make a great movie.
Ron Perlman, as ""One"", plays a great fish-out-of-water, speaking broken French and not being street-wise, and still manages to draw sympathy from the watcher.  Judith Vittet, ""Miette"" in the film, does a wonderful job showing how a person can develop, given the right set of circumstances.  And Daniel Emilfork, as the evil ""Krank"", still shows patience and respect under that vicious surface.  The rest of the characters, from The Professeur to Marthe, from the evil sisters to the little brother, all come through well throughout the film, enhancing the movie by showing character depth.
The movie itself is about a man, ""One"", trying to find his ""little brother"" after he gets kidnapped by a band of cyclopses to be sold to a man without dreams.  If this sounds a little odd to make a movie around, you couldn't be more right.  But somehow it works in this film, and works well.  As ""One"" meets ""Miette"" and together they take the weird twists and turns through their journey, you can't help but cheer them on.  Even on the ""evil"" side, some characters rise above it, showing wisdom, humour, and regret.

789566,5,6304083149,"THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a film the likes of which you will see rarely in a lifetime.  The reference in one of the reviews below, 'Dickens meets Dick', is an apt one -- the orphan children could be straight out of one of Charles Dickens' masterworks, and the setting itself, along with most of the other characters, could easily have sprung from the mind of sci-fi genius Philip K. Dick (who wrote the novella 'Do androids dream of electric sheep', upon which BLADE RUNNER was based).
Ron Perlman shines in his role as the gentle circus strongman who goes by the simple name of 'One', searching for his 'little brother' who has been kidnapped.  The young girl who plays Miette, whom he adopts as a 'little sister', is perfect.  And the villains...?  There are a ton of baddies in this incredible film -- all of them played to the hilt, the twisted stuff of nightmares.  Picture an evil pair of Siamese twins, a brain floating in a fish tank, a fumbling family of sub-genius clones, and an army of mechanically-augmented cyclopses -- you'll begin to see what I mean...
This film is a great example to Hollywood of what special effects should be -- they should be used to invoke a sense of place and mood, not simply to blow things up in grand scale (although there's a bit of that here, as well).  The mood that pervades the film is extremely dreamlike -- the shifting unreality that accompanies hallucinogenic nightmares coupled with a palpable sense of solidity.
The director that came to my mind as I was watching this is Terry Gilliam -- his work (TIME BANDITS, THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUCHAUSEN, THE FISHER KING, &c) has stunned me in the past in the same manner that this film did.  THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a modern masterpiece -- it's certainly not for every taste, but if you enjoy imaginitive fabulist film-making, you shouldn't allow yourself to miss it.",1019001600,11,1872,4.603603603603603
789567,4,6304083149,"Riding on the success of Amelie, the works of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (who actually co-directed City of Lost Children with Marc Caro) are reaching a wider audience.  City of Lost Children is the film Jeunet directed before Alien 4 and, like Amelie, it has a strange, dream-like quality that is both enticing and difficult to swallow.  That, however, is where the similarities between the two films end.
Speaking of dreams, that's exactly what City of Lost Children focuses on - the power and meaning of nocturnal images.  Set in a dystopic future, a mad scientist living on what appears to be an abandoned oil platform kidnaps children to attempt to siphon their dreams, so that he can once again enjoy sleep.  When he makes off with one of circus strongman Ron Perlman's friends, the gentle giant sets off to discover the city of lost children in the middle of the ocean.
City of Lost Children is a difficult movie to pin down; one part Monty Python, two parts Dark City, and one part Mad Max, it is, at once, a post-modern farce and a brilliant piece of art.  It's confusing and intentionally so.  It follows the po-mo rule ""weird for the sake of being weird,"" but in so doing redeems itself as a movie that, on some level, works.
Make no mistake: City of Lost Children is not for everyone.  In fact, even if someone liked Amelie, that person might not enjoy this film.  It's not a film for ""smart people"" or movie geeks (although they like to talk about it ad nauseum); it's a film that captures the essence of dreams and proceeds to eke a 100-minute movie from it.
The DVD presentation is superb, with a great video and sound transfer both on the original French track and the decent English dub (although purists will, no doubt, tell you to watch it in French).  While not a reference-quality disc, it should certainly satisfy any fan of the movie.  If one is unsure, City of Lost Children is a rent-before-you-buy deal.  Definitely NOT a DVD to buy ""blind.""",1018137600,10,1967,4.607449856733524

789572,4,6304083149,"Although I found it hard to traverse through it's convoluted story(s), I can get behind ""The City of Lost Children"" for two simple reasons: first, it has an abundance of Evil Santa imagery that appeals to the Scrooge/Grinch in me; and second, it's central conceit (that an evil scientist, prone to rapid aging, steals the pleasant dreams of innocent children, for that is his only life force... only he's so hideous that after seeing him, the children can only have nightmares) is at once bizarre, logical, nightmarish, and charming.  I can always support a movie that embraces its own dichotomies and hypocrisies so readily.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet's world, as many have said before me, is very much akin to Terry Gilliam's cinematic dream worlds.  In that respect, he's not creating anything new.  Both feature oppressive cityscapes, perpetually under the cover of darkness, wet with squalor and despair.  They both have a fine sense of the underground rising, revolution in the sewers, and hope where no hope could ever grow.  But where Gilliam can sometimes be cold and detached in his futuristic depictions, Jeunet gives his worlds a European sense of poeticism and beauty.  The ""City of Lost Children"" is built on a solid foundation of just those two elements.
Only it's not your father's poetry, or your mother's beauty that interests Jeunet.  The poetry comes in the form of science gone wrong, stretched to its limits.  He has an obsession with complex chrome gadgetry, and novel inventions.  Witness one scene, where a little girl, on her way to a secret lair, must traverse some steps.  She soon realizes that each step is actually a large organ key, which in sequence plays a scale announcing her arrival.  When she reaches the top, a mechanical eye, attached to a system of levers and pulleys, strains to see her.  It's overcomplicated, which enhances the aesthetic beauty of the thing, and makes it frighteningly poetic.  Jeunet also manages to concoct a scene wherein a single tear, through a series of Rube Goldbergian outcomes, causes a large boat to crash through a dock.  It's not only a fascinating scene to watch, and deeply poetic, but it also says much about the circuitous nature of fate.
Beauty is a different story.  Jeunet's concept of beauty is skewed: he is fascinated in conventionally ugly (or more accurately, eccentric looking) actors.  His camera studies their faces, as if they were beautiful.  In the end, they become beautiful.  His point here is that most people can't see past the external to the internal, and are thus blinded by outward appearances.  I suppose this is one of the reasons why the film has an abundance of cyclops imagery (a master scientist with a HAL-9000-esque single mechanical eye; the army of the night, who can only see through mechanical eyes of their own; and their vehicle, which is explicitly emblazoned with a large eye on the side, searching for young children to steal away).  In the City of Lost Children, the two-eyed man is king.
See how Jeunet treats Ron Perlman, a gorilla of a man with a pronounced jaw and sloped forehead.  He looks just as an illiterate circus strongman should.  But bathed in Jeunet's camera, and armed with the character's innocence, he becomes something else entirely.  How else could you justify his tender relationship with Miette, a precocious orphan girl?  Same goes for Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular.  Pinon plays seven cloned assistants to a mad scientist.  His rubbery features and enlarged cranium are thus given more personality than they could have achieved on their own.  The entire cast follows in this same line, transforming their inherent ugliness to a new kind of beauty.
This is further achieved through the way the city is photographed.  What could have been grainy and dirty instead becomes warm and lush, autumnal colours rising out of scrap iron.  Much of the credit should be given to cinematographer Darius Khondji, who got his start with Jeunet and did enough excellent work after that to allow me to say he is my favourite lens man working today.
""The City of Lost Children"" requires some patience, for it's payoff is long in coming.  Enjoy the lively visuals that Jeunet has given you in the meantime, and you'll get to the end nicely.",1010275200,15,4258,4.914685314685315
789573,4,6304083149,"This is as good a description as I can think to fit the overall look and feel of this movie by Jeunet and Caro. It has brilliant cinematography: it's a movie that takes place in a very dark setting, which is essential for the dark purposes of the plot. The scenography was definitely one of the most amazing things of the movie, with a city by the water, where night never seems to go away... Then, there's the music, composed by maestro Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks and Lost Highway among his credits): sad and beautiful, to go with the tragedies of the characters. The acting: all the praise please be given to Judith Vittet who played little Miette, and Dominique Pinon who played the six cloned henchmen (he seems to be a favorite of Jeunet, since he also appeared in ""Delicatessen,"" and more recently in ""Alien Resurrection"" and ""Amelie"").
The plot, however, is the reason why I gave the movie 4 stars alone. It's very convoluted in my opinion. Most people call the movie brilliant. I think a message in a movie doesn't have to be so criptic and hidden as to make it essentially inaccessible to most people. If you take some of the most brilliant directors of this genre, such as Terry Gilliam, you'll find that even they and their movies (take ""Brazil,"" for example) are more accessible. In fact, even ""Delicatessen,"" the previous movie by the directing couple from Belgium, was more accessible.",1008633600,3,1403,4.7073170731707314

I'm certainly not one to care at all about set design and costumes, but this film has such fascinating, mysterious and gorgeous production values that one can't help but fall in love with the movie, if for no other reason than physical attraction--if you will.
That aside, this esoteric and enigmatic film provides a wealth of adorable and sympathetic characters, namely One and Miette.  Somewhat remniscent of Luc Besson's ""Leon,"" in the respect of the fatherly/sexual attraction between the two lead characters, the film manages to take that ancient story and do something indescribable to it.  The incoherent dialogue, the unanswered questions, and the concept of One being not so bright are also ideas that are becoming too common in film.  Perhaps the awkward setting of the film is all that saves it from the ""Seen that already"" category.
Despite these cliches, however, and fits of screenwriting laziness, the film manages to place itself in a category on a different plane from all other films.  Somehow there is an unidentifiable heart in the film.  The power of the themes of innocence and protection and envy and love (in every sense of the word) is so intense and personable that one can not resist falling completely in love with the film and the characters of One and Miette.
As long as one can see past the eccentric style and mood of the film, he will find a truly heartwarming story that is propelled by truly problematic and frightening events, as opposed to the extremely American concept of cramming trite and inconsequential ""twists"" into love stories.",1004486400,3,1624,4.930402930402931

Whenever I try to share this movie with a friend or another family member, they don't see the uniqueness of these visuals as I, or the rest of us reviewers do.  And yet, they thought ""The Matrix"" was so wonderful for the visuals.  I guess what's missing is the senseless violence the shallow people enjoy.

It's exactly like one of my dreams, but you can think of it as Blade Runner meets Popeye and Oliver Twist.
The film opens with a little kid watching Santa Claus emerge from the chimney.  I thought, ""That's one creepy-looking Santa!"" but the kid didn't seem to mind.  Then there was a good reason for the kid to get good and freaked out, so my first impression was vindicated.
Some reviewers focus on the scenery of this movie, which is admittedly top-notch, but I am enthralled by the characters.  I'd like to know how this movie was cast.  Did the director do a cattle call for weird-looking people?  I think he must have, because the only folks who fit in the middle of the bell curve are the children and one prostitute.
The director walks a thin line with his imagery.  With a slightly different cant, it could be considered kinky and fetishistic.  A lot of attention is paid to bare feet.  Two scenes show a dog lovingly licking a man's foot for a prolonged period, and another scene exhibits One giving 9-year old Miette an equally loving foot massage.  Somehow, it doesn't seem pervy, but strangely appropriate.
The City of Lost Children has obviously become an influential movie.  For example, The Matrix borrows heavily from it.  Just watch the dream-sharing sequences of City and compare it with the matrix-entry scenes of The Matrix.  If that doesn't do it for you, compare the names of the central heroes.",995932800,6,1696,4.622073578595318
789632,5,6304083149,"This is a wonderful French film, which here in America gets tagged as an ""art film"" because it's so different from most of our pictures.  The scenes involving Santa Clause are so incredibly creepy you won't believe.  The imagery is truly fabulous.  Does anyone else think Dominique Pinion is one of the most ""different"" looking people you've ever seen?  A friend said I was understating it a bit when I made that comment after viewing Diva.  I must say, though, that Jeunet was absolutely incompatible with the Alien series, and never should have been involved with the fourth film.  His surrealist irony just doesn't mesh well with sci-fi horror.",995587200,,647,4.889908256880734
789633,5,6304083149,"The entire cast was excellent! This movie was inspired by a video game, The background scenes look very much like they do in the game. The film stars Ron Perlman & french actress Judith Vittet. The story is about a scientist who can't dream or feel sadness, so in order to, he has children kidnapped by 'cyclopses', men with optic eye implants. The scientist is looking for a young child to hook their mind up with his so that he might ""become them"" and have normal emotion once again. When Perlmans character One's little brother is taken by the cyclopses he teams up with 9 year old Miette who knows where the children are being held captive. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy/adventure flicks, or those who remember playing the game. I liked Judith Vittets' character -Miette- the most, She was a smart and likeable character. Other favorites include the clone character, and Ron Perlman. I have watched both versions of this movie, therefore, I recommend the french version w/english subtitles! Don't miss out on this movie!! : >)",994896000,,1053,4.791208791208791
789684,5,6304083149,"Beautiful tale exemplifying the simplicity of friendship, and how strong it can be. Ron Perlman does an astounding job playing ""One,"" a simple-minded circus performer who wishes no more than to make his way through life with a little boy in his care.
The little boy is kidnapped in order to participate in the evil Krank's scheme to discover why Krank cannot dream. Ultimately, if one is truly an utter genius, is there any room for creativity? Is that perhaps the end-all of his existence--that he is so perfectly created that there are no surprises left for him...and that's why he is incapable of dreaming? And the dreams of the children always turn into nightmares as he arrives in them through his experimental equipment, possibly as a demonstration that he is the antithesis of all this is present in childhood: innocent ignorance, make-believe, friendship with similar peers, and so on.
The acting is fantastic and the music score is exceptional. Angelo Badalamenti, I feel, is so unappreciated in his time. Remember, this is the same man who wrote the Twin Peaks soundtrack--how different could the two scores possibly be?!? Marianne Faithful is an extraordinary vocalist, providing voice for the haunting lyrics to the song's end credits.

It can be a bit confusing when your watching it in subtitles and they say some thing like ""One needs to find his brother"" But now that I've told you, this confusion can be avoided.

789686,5,6304083149,"A friend of mine, whose opinion I usually respect, called this movie ""overproduced."" And at the time, I thought I saw what he meant; but as I rewatch this movie (which has entranced me since first I saw it) I think I see where he went wrong. What he mistook for gratuitous style is actually deliberate design--design with a purpose, which thereby carries meaning. The creators intentionally draw your eye away from the characters to the details of the city which surrounds them; a city, which as the title reports, is what the movie's all about. It's about ""cities"" and about ""children"", and about the relationship that children have, as a human demographic class, to life in cities, which is the Primary Effect of Modern Life. The city is an engine of adversity, apparently consuming children, as all too many real contemporary cities do. But this very adversity breeds intelligence; not in any noticably genetic way, but in a cultural way. For the city has its child survivors, and they are creatures of pure intelligence; living by their wits, their flexibility of means, and their ability to focus on a purpose. And the city not only consumes, but its rich fabric of cause-and-effect also sustains and provides luck for the clever. But the larger forces in human affairs--Industry, Science, Religion, etc.--the forces which have given birth to cities, are all marked by their indifference to children, as are all but One of the adults depicted in the film. ""The City of Lost Children"" stands as a telling caricature of such indifference that actually exists in our world, and a testament to the survival power of children.
The DVD medium allows you to dissect the seeming ""distractions"" in the production design, and reveals them as statements of the city's character, as well as simply pure art: the range of scale depicted in one scene alone--from objects measured in milligrams to objects measured in thousands of metric tons (all keys to the narrative)--is fantastic. The scene selection portion of the DVD is done very well, and allows you to behold the larger structure of the film in an informative way.",984268800,5,2114,4.907821229050279

The story line, while a little convoluted, is at least interesting. I feel a little like The Grinch criticizing Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's eerie cinematic genius. The plot is basic: an urban strongman's surrogate ""little brother"" is stolen by a group of deranged cyborg-creatures dubbed the cyclops'. In order to get the little boy, Denree, back, the strongman enlists the help of a motley crew of child kleptos.

789688,5,6304083149,"First of all, let me say that ""City"" on DVD is absolutely stunning!  I was impressed with my VHS copy.  But on DVD it's a visual treat for the eyes.  This is why I added DVD capability to my PC.  The sharpness of the picture is among the best in my DVD collection.  There's so much to look at you'll never take it all in with one viewing.  The makers of ""City"" have created a world unlike anything you've seen outside of Terry Gilliam's Brazil.  Indeed, movies usually don't look this good unless they have Gilliam's name stamped on them somewhere.  Even if the story totally sucked (it doesn't) I would own this just to sit back and watch the gorgeous visuals!
Almost as stunning as the picture is the sound.  The vivid sound effects are spot on.  There are several sound tracks to choose from too.  But the french soundtrack is the only one you should use (I know only a little french so I turn on the english subtitles).  If you hate subtitles then this movie may make it worth your while to learn some french!  I for one enjoy the sound of the french language.  Maybe ""City"" can help me learn french.  But if you need it there is a subpar english Dubbed version of the soundtrack.
For picture and sound it deserves a 5 out of 5 for each.  If you are a fan of ""City"" then buy it on DVD.  If you like Terry Gilliam-type flicks (Brazil, Time Bandits, The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen) then give ""City"" a try.",981676800,4,1412,4.287878787878788

789690,5,6304083149,"An excellent movie with a classic sub-plot descriptive of God and his relationship with his creation.  Consider:
1) God:  The 'Original' who lives underwater, seperated from mankind.  He has forgotten his creation (the clones, etc.) and remains seperate from them, preferring the seculsion of the ocean.  He vaguely remembers that his creation turned on him and attacked him.  Ultimatly, he destroys himself and his creation at the end of the movie, leaving the rest of mankind to fend for themselves.  Illustrative of man growing away from a further need or contact with a God.
2)  Prior to the start of the movie (seen in a flashback), 'The Original' creates man in his perfect image (the various clones/worker bees), all of which are quite imperfect.  Yet they all want to be 'The Original' and hope that they are...
3)  Prior to the start of the movie (seen in a flashback), 'The Original' creates his 'ultimate creation' in the form of the dreamless one Krank who is symbolic of Lucifer, the fallen one. He preys upon the young and innocent, hoping to steal their dreams (innocence) and winds up with their (his) nightmares...
4)  Seperation from 'The Original' and his 'creation' occurs during a falling out (seen in a flashback) between The dwarf woman (Eve) who starts the fight between 'The Original' and his clones as well as Krank.
5)  Uultimate innocence and intelligence is, of course, seen in the children who become stupid as they grow into adults.  The only smart people in the movie are the children, while 'The city of lost children' are really the adults.
6)  Organized religion is reflected in the 'Cyclops' religious cult who cuts out their eyes so that they may 'see the light' more clearly.  Note how in their temple there are hundreds of them seated up into the air, in the form of an alter reaching upwards into the sky.
7)  The Brain:  Ingellectualism in its rawest form (no further need of a body).  The brain wants to destroy the 'creation' but also wants to save itself in the end.
8)  The Octopus:  Siamese twins (organized crime) who will do anything to further its cause, and exploit mankind to that end.
9)  The One (Ron Perleman):  Illustrative of the innocence in and adult, which if kept alive, provides him with the innocence (though not the intelligence) of a child.
Anyway, I could go on and on.  Most viewers will probably just see the plot as good vs bad, etc. but I think Ron Perleman was making quite a statement here...

The movie is very visual, with many wonderful things to look at, and something always happening, but I didn't completely understand the movie.  It wasn't because of the subtitles either, I don't mind reading along to follow a movie, as a matter of fact I frequently watch a movie with the captioning turned on in case I can't understand what someone is saying, but what I was reading during this movie didn't always explain what was happening on the screen.
 The basic plot of the movie, as far as I was able to gather, was that a mad scientist type is unable to dream so he kidnaps children, hooks himself up to them, and experiences their dreams.  Reading what I just wrote, I have to say that the movie is just about as crazy as what I wrote sounds.  Still, there were moments when I regarded the screen in awe, as strange things I had never seen before filled the screen and showed me a new world.  Where exactly this film is supposed to take place I don't know because the world I was watching seemed to incorporate technologies from differing eras.
 Ron Perlman, of Beauty and the Beast fame, plays One, a circus strongman who is looking for his brother, one of the little children who was kidnapped.  He frequently drifts off track during his search for different reasons.  One of the main ones being that he isn't one of the greatest thinkers of the movie, and often seems to be lost, or acting before thinking.  Actually, he doesn't do all that much thinking, that is left to his sidekick, an orphan girl who joins him on his quest and seems to be about three times smarter and about a dozen times more shrewd than he is.
 I won't give away any more of this movie, mainly because it's too hard to try to follow the twisting story line or to make it seem coherent.  I can't say this is really a great movie, but it did hold my attention, mainly because of the visual splendor of the whole thing.  If you're in the mood for something really different, I'd say pick up this film and give it a try.
 Oh, just two more thoughts.  After seeing this movie, it's hard to look at Santa Claus again as a benevolent elf, you'll understand what I mean if you watch the movie.  Also, we've all heard about the chain of events theory, where something small can set off a large scale catastrophy, well, we are given a depiction of this is this film which stretches the limits of believability, but judge for yourself.

This film has the unique quality of originality and quirkiness which is so lacking in Hollywood lackluster product these days. It has a capturing colorful gothic feel to it and cast of characters provide a backdrop every bit as effective as the wonderful stage sets that take place in an underwater laboratory, a seedy harbor side slum area and a number of other memorable locations.
 Although the film is subtitled, I tend to forget this as I get into the first five minutes of the film, and most of the humour is clearly not lost, as in a series of scenes where the villains numerous identical cloned children argue amongst themselves about who is the ""original"".
 Another reviewer compared it Pi, which for originality and creativity is about right, but I would compare it more along the lines of a slightly more cheerful and utlimately redeeming Brazil.",975369600,,983,4.810650887573964

Immediately, we sense that the most sacred of all places is a place to fear.  As in Shakespeare's Hamlet we find that ""...something is wrong in the State of Denmark.""  Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro's film shows high art without losing grounded reality in filmmaking.  Although plot can be a bit confusing for the average viewer whose first language is not visual, the story of the mad scientist kidnapping children to steal their dreams is fascinating and metaphorically accurate.  A real-life example would be a man going through mid-life crisis.  He'll shed all that which is old, such as his wife and station wagon, in favor of a 19-year old mistress and a Harley-Davidon Motorcycle to recaputre a dream or goal he had given up long ago.  A brain floating in a glass aquarium, commands a set of clones made from the original scientist.  Through these clones and the innocent children, the filmmakers show that childhood can embody both selfishness and cruelty as well as joy and innocense.  Visually stunning,  the evil, sinister, and moody tone is balanced by humor.  Such combinations are not only a mark of sophistication, but also of grace.

789713,5,6304083149,"It is true that City of Lost Children is a visually stunning movie, with some truly breathtaking sets and a feeling of atmosphere that few American films can match. It's also true that City of Lost Children isn't like your average American potboiler movie, where the characters charge through the setting at top speed, in a rush to kill the villain and set off as many explosions as possible. The movie is ultimately about atmosphere, and if it takes a long, contemplative look at its characters, it's at the expense of the kind of frenetic pacing to which American moviegoers (including myself) have become accustomed.
I think those who complain about City of Lost Children's ""incoherent plot"" or ""muddled script"" ultimately miss the point of the movie. The movie is part dream, part fairy tale, with bold, simple characters and a bold, colorful setting. Nothing in this movie intends to make you think deeply about the human condition. The movie doesn't feature a complicated plot, nor should it. It's ultimately a fairy tale for adults, and doesn't aspire to reinvent the dramatic wheel.
Watching City of Lost Children, I was grateful for its slow pacing, and the leisure with which the film develops its simple story. Very few movies create a compelling, absorbing sense of time and place, and many of those rush through them self-consciously, pushing you towards another car chase, explosion, or gunfight. City of Lost Children has none of these. It allows you a good, long look at this other time and place, and I found that a highly rewarding change from the average movie experience.

It truly is a visual haunt.
The script and the acting is not in the same league as the set though.  The script and plot are at times confusing and filled with holes.  The acting is sometimes over done and not truly believable.  However, the movie does have some very rewarding scenes that are both well directed and acted.

It starts promisingly enough, but quickly disintegrates into a big mess.  Sure, it looks great.

Oops, seems we forgot those things in favor of cramming as many ""weird"" characters as we could in.  I have no trouble with non-linear narratives.  In fact, I prefer them.

On a different note,  I don't think that comparisons to the  Crow and Dark City are entirely accurate because the tone of City of Lost  Children is so different.

It's brilliant.  BUT DO NOT, *I REPEAT*, DO NOT GET THE  ENGLISH OR OTHER DUBBED VERSION--see only the subtitled version.  The  others are terrible.
The music is eery and quaint and wonderful.  If you  truly enjoy movies such as the new ""Godzilla"" then you might want  to pass this one by.  If you liked ""Cube"" or ""Pi"" or  ""Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" or ""Baron von  Munchausen"" or ""Time Bandits"" or ""Princess Bride""  etc. then you will love this one.  It's probably better than most if not  all of them.  Well, Princess Bride is far more quotable (might not be the  case if I were French).

789828,5,6304083149,"Arousing is the catch-word for this movie. Created by the brilliant Belgian duo; Marc Caro (Caro makes a cameo appearence in this movie) and J. P. Jeunet, this motion picture contains the most stunning visuals I've ever  seen.
It is a twisted, dark fairy tale about a genius created by an even  greater genius. The genius creator, however, manages to jinx each of his  creations (rather, a wicked genetic fairy casts a spell on the creations)  and Krank-the-genius suffers from an inability to dream. Because of this,  he ages far too quickly.
To counter this unfortunate fate, Krank begins  stealing children from the glitzy kleptomania capital, 'The City of Lost  Children'. Placing them in a machine he's dubbed the sarcophagus (because  it resembles the Egyptian variety) Krank attaches wildly deformed  head-pieces to the craniums of the unsuspecting tykes and tries, in vain,  to extract their dreams. Alas, his attempts always fail and the dreams turn  into nightmares, in part, because Krank is one scary muther and probably  the last thing the kiddies glimpse before slumberland.
Krank finds the  'boy for him', in Denree (Don-ray), the three-year-old surrogate little  brother to the City's Strongman, One. When Krank's evil henchmen, The  Cyclops, abduct Denree from his trailer-home one rainy evening, One is  catapulted into a nightmarish adventure to get him back. To do so, he  enlists the help of a motely crew of rag tag child-kleptos, in particular,  a dark-haired little girl named Miette.

Krank - a man who can't dream so he steals dreams off of children? The most amazing artwork ever put to celluloid? oh....and the effects are fittingly perfect...
A person could want no more It is a film that will pull you in to it's weirdness and hold you like a dream.  You will feel that you have to watch it again just for the effect it has on you.
HIGHLIGHT: MIETTE is being strangled by ONE, as she cries a tear flies from her face and causes a chain of events that result in the electricity of the town being cut off thus disabling the lighthouse which in turn sees a huge cargo ship crash into the harbour and comes to a stop inches from the twin sisters who are watching the events...A tear saves MIETTE

This movie is fantastic! Simply splendid! Everything from the  actors, to the colors (pastel or lack thereof) of the scenes.

Once there, the atmosphere, the odd faces, the love between  the strongman and the little girl, the deliciously evil octopus lady -- I  could go on -- will hold you, will make you laugh, will make you cry. And a  great cast too. I couldn't find anyone I felt out of place. A couple minor  continuity problems (the strongman's hair is shorter near the end, and did  he sew his sweater back together?) don't detract from this wonderful,  flightful fantasy. Buy it.

I was captivated by the very surreal and dark look of the sets as well as the plot.  The look and feel of the  movie remiend me of the works by former Monty Python brain, Terry Gilliam  (12 monkeys, Brazil, Time Bandits, Baron Munchausin).

It bases in a strange, twisted, floating city. Where a  carnival strongman takes a poor, homeless boy into his home. But the evil  Cyclops that terrorize the city kidnap. That's when the adventure begins.  He then goes searching for him and teams up with a small girl named Miette.  Together, the strong man (One) and Miette. Go searching for the lost boy.  They soon enter a strange underworld. Learning that a madman played  perfectly by Daniel Emilfork, a Princess, and six bumbling, clumbsy clones  are kidnapping childre because the madman(Krank) was created with the  others by a perfessor and Krank can't dream. So now they kidnap children  and steal their dreams. But all the children fear him and have nightmares.  Krank soon buys One's child from the Cyclops and uses him in his master  plan. Now Miette and One bind a relationship while two evil twins hunt them  down, while meeting a strange scuba diver, a psychotic circusman, and the  Cyclops layer. All of the adventure is jammed pack into one movie. It's my  favorite, I can't take my eyes off of it. See this film!

But I kept watching, and I was drawn  into the story. A brilliant scientist who cannot dream is stealing children  who can, and attempting to dream vicariously through them; however, he  can't understand why all they have is nightmares. He is watched  despairingly by his servants and companions, who include six cloned  individuals called Mishinka and a disembodied brain named Irvin (voiced by  Jean-Louis Trantignant)who has migraines. Meanwhile One, a circus strongman  who has lost his little brother Denree to the scientist and Miette,  youthful leader of a band of orphans, are attempting to free the children  from the scientist's clutches. The adventure by itself is fascinating, and  the characters live on in your mind long after the credits roll. The entire  movie is reminiscent of a dream itself; the squalid semi-futuristic town  where the story begins can easily be imagined as the realm of nightmare.  Stunning visual effects and costumes by Jean-Paul Gaultier add to the  overall lush style. See also Delicatessen, by the same director.",915408000,16,1238,5.0344827586206895

I like strange different movies that have some depth. This is not that, this was like a high school student film that's entire purpose was just trying to be weird without ever stopping to think why so just came off silly and shallow. No real story, no character development, acting was terrible, there was no deeper meaning or anything about the movie either so just came off feeling shallow and empty.
