2797917,5,B000OONQ1W,"It is so transformative to experience Tristan und Isolde done by a director who understands the mythic dimensions of this piece and who obviously loves the volcanic force this music.  There are no directorial banalities here to undermine the music.  It is powerful theatre and powerful music.

Johanna Meier is glorious as Isolde.  She has power, lyricism, vulnerability, looks, musicality.  It is too bad that this great artist's career was undervalued and underappreciated.

Rene Kollo is wonderful and has great chemistry with Meier.  The way he listens to King Marke's monologue in Act II is heart breaking.  Matti Salminen's Marke is an emotional tour de force and a psychological revelation.

Like the other reviewers here, I endorse this DVD enthusiastically.  There is no other version of this opera on DVD that compares to this.  AND THAT IS THE TRUTH.",1187136000,90,861,5.122302158273381
2797918,5,B000OONQ1W,"Much like my recent review of the 1981 Bayreuth production of Parsifal I am happy to say that this is by far the best production of Tristan und Isolde that I have seen and comes close to fulfilling everything that I imagine Wagner himself would have sought regarding his vision of gesamtkunstwerk.

There are no serious flaws with this performance/production though it is not perhaps absolutely perfect it is much better than other productions I have seen, including those that have been fairly traditional, that by comparison seem somewhat static and lacking in imagination in terms of staging.

Ponelle does a great job here firstly and foremost with a staging that perfectly complements the score - this is particularly clear in Act 2 whilst both Act 1 and Act 3 have appropriate sets. In Act 2 the music synthesizes perfectly with the changes from day to night and from the lovers' perception of day to night to day - sort of expressionistic but I think it works. Like the Parsifal production mentioned earlier the depiction of a natural world - large tree, grass, night and day effects - make this performance come to life and I think it is befitting of a Wagner opera: we see the natural world blend with a sort of transcendental world; this is a point that seems to be overlooked in modern productions of say 'der Ring'. The first act is done well though I felt it is the weakest of the three acts. This is perhaps difficult to stage but the use of a mast that semi-obscures Tristan seems quite appropriate. The final act opens impressively on a rock by a blackened tree as if to provide a contrast with the similarly dominating and very much alive tree present in the previous act when the lovers are in their element. Tristan is lying by the blackened tree and the shepherd sits side on to the audience to the left of the rock playing his pipe - I think this is a really effective touch, very melancholic but somehow mystical.
I am not sure about the ending in this act, it isn't what Wagner would have wanted, and I understand what Ponelle is doing here but I'm not sure about it really: Without meaning to spoil things he is essentially trying to engender the feeling that the finale isn't in fact tragic but actually is a sort of bliss through Schopenhaurian renuniciation.

The acting and singing performances of the key players are excellent: Kollo and Meier as the chief protagonists, Salminen as Marke, and also Schwarz as Brangaene. They certainly invest a lot of emotional energy and the studio recording allows for pretty much faultless sound, also in terms of being able to discern the singers and the orchestra clearly. Kollo and Meier are perhaps a little too old but that is maybe inevitable for an opera like this. Kollo doesn't look particularly upright and heroic in the opening act but is full of pathos and weltschmerz in the final act in a way that I can't imagine Vickers, for example, could be. Meier's age is perhaps a little too apparent in the close ups in the first act while in act 2 and 3 from a distance she makes a very fine Isolde. Salminen is spot on as Marke and puts real nuanced, rather than hammy, emotion into his performance. Schwarz sings very well throughout and her performance of the 'einsam wachend in der nacht' solo, one of my favourite bits, is really blended into the opera perfectly here. The other performers are also strong.

The conducting and orchestration is terrific. You would probably expect this given that the eminent Wagner conductor Barenboim is at the helm. His conducting emphasizes more the beauty than the passion of the work and on that basis i would liken it more to Furtwangler's famous recording rather than the more recent Bhm cd recording. Again, the beauty of the music is brought out more by the ongoing events on stage that are, for the most part, perfectly complementary in a manner that I would assume adheres fairly accurately with Wagner's staging specifications; although I would suspect that this would, at the time, have been considered in many ways a modern expressionistic interpretation.

Not much else to report except that from the dvd productions I have that are Bayreuth they have tended to be better on the whole anyway, I think the size and shape of the stage perhaps facilitate this. The quality of picture, chastized by another reviewer here, was not a problem for me - it's not perfect but it is as good as most classic dvd recordings and i don't think this made any difference to my enjoyment frankly.

So, i'd definitely recommend this, I prefer it to the Nilsson, Vickers, Bhm dvd recording and to the Jones, Kollo recording - where I think both singing and acting (probably owing to direction) is, for the most part, poor to be honest.

If you have always felt that the performances of Tristan und Isolde (whether on dvd or staged live) have not quite met with your expectations of how the opera could or should be done, then I think this could be the one for you and should really hammer home the greatness of this work.",1186185600,27,5026,4.646794150731159
2797919,5,B000OONQ1W,"""Tristan Und Isolde"" is doubtless one of the greatest operas ever written.  Unfortunately it has been very badly served by the currently available productions on DVD.

The Nilsson/Vickers from Orange is ruined (as usual from Kultur) by a very poor technical production and design.

The Heppner/Eaglen from the Met has two principals who cannot act convincingly; although Heppner can really sing the part.  Eaglen's voice leaves a great deal to be desired and her physical limitations prevent her from much in the way of physical action.  Neither of them look even remotely the way I am sure most of us have pictured Tristan and Isolde to have looked.

The West/Meier from Munich is a travesty.  The setting is just plain stupid, given what the text calls for; and West not only fails to sing convincingly, but he cannot act and looks even less like Tristan than Heppner.  What is so frustrating is the waste of Waltraud Meier who has the acting and singing ability and the looks; and the waste of Kurt Moll who is a superb King Marke.

The Treleaven/Polaski from Barcelona is also spoiled by a silly production and less than stellar singing from the principals.  They are the same cast as was used in the Barcelona Kupfer II ""Ring"", and I truly hated Treleaven and Struckmann there, as well as here.

I am writing this review now, despite not having seen this production for almost a year (since I found out that it would be rereleased as a DVD), because I want to share my great enthusiasm for it.  It is based on my recollection of my much cherished Video.  I have waited a long time for this rerelease as a DVD, and I am sure that DGG, unlike Kultur, have done their usual great technical transfer.  It is a Bayreuth production from the early 1980's.

Jean-Pierre Ponnelle has designed a simple, but effective non-gimmicky set.  The first act takes place on the deck of a stylised sailing ship, the second in the woods under a huge full canopied tree, and the third under a dead, split, blasted tree.  The direction is tight and, with one notable exception at the end, is true to the text.  I will not give it away other than to remark that up to then it was such a straight interpretation that Ponnelle probably could not resist putting at least some personal twist to it.  Mind you, considering what was going on with Mathilda Wesendonck at the time, perhaps this is what Wagner might have subconsciously intended.

Under the conducting of Daniel Barenboim, the music is splendidly interpreted.  It is clear, layered, and exciting.  This certainly came across on my video, and I am sure that in surround sound it will be even better.

And the acting and singing and appearance of all the characters is an unalloyed joy.  Ren Kollo as Tristan, Matti Salminen as King Marke, Hermann Becht as Kurwenal and Hanna Schwartz as Brangane.

However, this is a tour de force by Johanna Meier.  She embodies all that I had pictured Isolde to be.  She is beautiful, she sings -- my God, she sings -- and she expressively acts with the grace of a dancer.  So far as I know, this is the only recording of her.  What a loss.

For fear of getting even more carried away, I had better stop here; other than to state that I wish I could give it more than five stars.

But if you want a ""Tristan Und Isolde"" that is the gesamptkunstwerk I am sure Wagner had in mind (and possibly even with this  ending) this is it!!",1184457600,216,3402,4.553542009884679
2797920,1,B000OONQ1W,"The singing is ok, but Johanna Meier doesn't possess a large enough voice for Isolde. The staging is fine. The sets and costumes are beautiful. But I have a major problem with this production. The director changed Wagner's ending! Changed it into an ending that is ridiculous. He must have an ego the size of Napoleon. He actually changed Wagner's ending! What!!!!!?????",1381190400,6,370,4.983870967741935
2797921,2,B000OONQ1W,"Though I realize this is a filmed rather than a live stage performance, I was extremely disappointed to notice that the 3rd act is obviously lip-synched.  Ruined it for me.  I did not notice this as much in the first 2 acts, but I will take another look.  Much is very effective and evocative, the prelude being especially hypnotic visually as well as musically.  I especially like the director's concept of the ultimate scene being Tristan's hallucinations.  The sight of him being held by Kurwenal was extremely moving and poignant.  The close-ups of Kollo in the finale are heart-rending and he looks appropriately handsome with the scruffiness.  Hanna Scwartz is uninvolvled and unmoved during the whole opera though she sings the warning nicely.  Kurwenal has intonation problems.  Not a Tristan to recommend.",1362787200,4,814,5.106060606060606

I thought the audio quality was excellent.  I would have preferred a few more closeups but the ovrall experience was that of attending an opera and ocasionally using the opera glasses so in that respect it was very authentic.",1341964800,2,372,4.676923076923077
2797925,4,B000OONQ1W,"Wagner's innovative opera Tristan und Isolde, loosely based on an old Celtic legend, is pretty much a difficult opera to stage mostly because of its vocal demands for the two main characters. At barely over four hours in length, these two roles can be quite exhausting for any singer. Fortunately, there are those who have easily pulled it off. This particular Bayreuth production produced in 1983, starring Ren Kollo and Johanna Meier, is one that would satisfy any type of operagoer. Though admittedly, it's not really an excellent production.

CONDUCTOR:
I currently own a studio recording of Tristan und Isolde on CD, with Carlos Kleiber conducting the Staatskapelle Dresden. With one compares Kleiber's interpretation to Daniel Barenboim's own, then one can easily tell the difference. While the former favors quicker tempi and more exhilarating tension, the latter prefers slower speeds and smoother lyricism. But Barenboim isn't always slow: he also brings plenty of adrenaline when it's needed the most. At the same time, he pays more attention to detail in the orchestral score. And he doesn't muse over a single note (much like how James Levine does with his live Metropolitan production of Wagner's Ring Cycle). The one scene that I consider horrifically dull is when Tristan and Isolde sing of their love in Act Two. It goes on for so long that I almost wanted to fast forward the entire Act. At least Kleiber knew when to speed things up a little. But besides that, Barenboim is an intelligent Wagnerian conductor, and he knows how to move things along for most of the time.

ORCHESTRA:
I expected the Bayreuth Orchestra to give a masterful performance, and I got it. The players sound fantastic and they are careful with Barenboim's choice of tempi and dynamics. True, they're not as polished as the Berlin Philharmonic during Karajan's glory days, but they are completely involved with Wagner's complex music. It's an almost flawless performance.

STAGING:
Jean-Pierre Ponnelle brings a semi-traditional touch to Wagner's work. It isn't exactly what Wagner intended it to be, but it's still set in Cornwall and Brittany in Medieval times. The sets are very bleak with only white, black, gray, brown, and beige being the primary colors. The giant tree in Act 2 is one exception with its colorful leaves and flowers. Tristan's ship in Act 1 doesn't really look like a ship at all; instead, it looks almost like a rock formation with a ship's mast on top of it. For most of the time, the plot is followed very faithfully. However, the end of Act 3 is the one with the most obvious change. The entire ending is revised almost to the point that it would most certainly anger Wagner purists. I, for one, am still trying to figure out why the change was made. And judging by the abrupt turn of events, I doubt that this was how it was performed in front of a live audience (keep in mind that this performance was filmed without an audience).

SINGING/PERFORMANCES:
The singers are the stars of this Bayreuth production. Kollo and Meier are marvelous as the two main characters. The handle the vocal requirements very well and they sing their parts very clearly. These two must be the finest Tristan/Isolde pair ever captured on video. Matti Salminen always had a deep and sturdy voice, and he is simply brilliant as King Marke. His acting skills are very impressive as well. Hermann Becht is excellent as Kurwenal, while Hanna Schwarz is absolutely adorable as Brangne. The minor characters (sung by Schunk, Pampuch, and Egel) complete the outstanding cast.

CONCLUSION:
This production may look very drab, but it's exquisite overall. The singers are excellent, the conducting is supremely splendid, and the sets look impressive. Despite the fact that the love duet in Act 2 can be a bit of a bore, and that the weird close-ups during the end of Act 3 can get quite annoying, it's still an enjoyable experience. The ending is indeed questionable in some parts, but I'll accept it for now. Overall, this is a very good traditional production that is recommended.

2797926,5,B000OONQ1W,"I have only seen this production on this DVD of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde so I cannot say too much in comparison but I do want to make some comments about the ending given that I have read a synopsis of the ending so that I can see what was changed.  For me I think it was the change that increased the level of emotional impact for me at the end that left me literally crying like a baby which I am not at all prone to do.

Spoiler alert!
The ending change basically forces the drama to become a kind of descent through the process of dying into the archetypal psychic depths of the character Tristan.  In a kind of psychological compensation to the dying Tristan for the experience of the trouble he found himself in and which caused him to actively seek death in Act II, Tristan experiences a kind of ideal reconciliation without contradicting his need to die.  This heightens the idealism of his desires despite the depth of the moral problems he had found himself immersed in.  By removing the development of the characters responses to Tristan from the characters to Tristan's own psyche, the opera goer suddenly finds him or herself being spoken to by Isolde (in Jungian terms, Tristan's anima) on a whole deeper level.  By the end I was crying because I felt as if my own soul (Isolde) was telling me never to  surrender my love for life and those people and passions I have in it to the banalities and practicalities of mere reality but embrace what deeply drives you in spite of it all.  And if you never feel peace in this world know that you will have your reward in the end.  I can't think of a better experience to get from any dramatic enactment than that.  I can't guarantee you will but its worth a shot!",1313107200,3,1723,4.389937106918239
2797927,4,B000OONQ1W,"This 1983 Bayreuth Festival film of Wagner's monumental ode to passion is considered by many to be the best available. It is the only production available on DVD to hold to anything like a conventional setting, and only takes a radical interpretation in the last moments of the final act. Wagner's music drama (he used the word 'handlung' or treatment) was inspired in part by the great medival romances by Gottfried von Strasbourg and his predecessors, Schopenhauer's  philosophy, and his personal life's own reality-show level drama.

Daniel Barenboim's reading of the score is lush and lyrical. It would gain in dramatic bite in the 1995 production's DVD, and even more so in the later La Scala performance, as it did at the MET in the mid 2000s. It is a beautiful reading, though, the great Bayreuth orchestra plays splendidly, but the pre-digital recording is a bit dim and balance between the pit and the stage is not always ideal (often an issue in Bayreuth recordings).

Jean-Pierre Ponelle was a controversial director in the 70s and 80s, but by today's standards he seems downright conservative. So it seems that all the indignant criticism of his ending to this opera must border on the reactionary. I find it is not the concept so much as the execution which should be criticized. His original idea had been to keep Isolde invisible throughout and sing from the pit. That was vetoed by Wolfgang Wagner, Barenboim, and Ms. Meier. In the filming and editing M. Ponelle seems to have attempted to incorporate more of that idea into the staging, without success. I think the director's first duty is to make things clear to the audience, and what is happening here isn't clear until the curtain is down and you've had a minute or two to figure things out. Likewise, at the end of the first act, as King Marke steps into view and Isolde bows her crown falls off. Was this deliberate? If not, it should have been re-shot or played accordingly. Many other ideas play beautifully. After drinking the potion from a wide golden dish, the lovers stare into their reflections as the love-draught take hold. In the second act they similarly gaze into a small pool of water during less heated intervals of lovemaking. Tristan's very deliberate self-impalement on Melot's sword at the end of the act (Wagner asks that he merely lower his guard) has become almost canonical law in the past decades.

The famous prelude is accompanied by a lovely image of rock outcroppings in a sea of swirling mist. Ponelle's scenery and costumes are lushly romantic: a tree stand upstage center in each act. Its trunk forms the prow of the ship in act one, then a stage-filling willow (Herrick's 'lover's best'?) in act two. Act three has the tree lighting-split on a tiny outcrop of land amid that mist-swirled sea.

As for the singing, Johanna Meier, the first American to sing Isolde at Bayreuth, is strongest in Act One. Although she is essentially a lirico-spinto of the germanic (i.e. Mozart-Strauss) type, she manages Isolde's heaviest outbursts in the Narrative and Curse without strain. Hers is a rich, creamy authentic soprano, not a pushed up mezzo. Much of Isolde's music is marked piano or pianissimo, and Meier as able to scale back her voice quite effectively. However, abiout half way through the Act Two love duet she finds herself unable to get back to full voice and gets stuck in a kind of head-voice mix (rather like Zinka Milanov in the 50s). It is not a very drastic change of sound, or unpleasant, but lacks the power of her full voice. She is an attractive woman in an all-American hausfrau-ish way, and costumed all in white contrasts well with Kollo's all black garb.

Rene Kollo was a jazz drummer studying acting when his voice was discovered. Never the most beautiful instrument, his strength lay in cutting edge power and dramatic expression. Like Wolfgang Windgassen, that edge could become unpleasant under pressure, but here he is in excellent voice. Kollo plays Tristan as doom-fated by guilt from the get go, making his nihilism a foregone conclusion. His boyish face and huge expressive blue eyes are set off all the more by his dark wig and costume. His third act delirium is agonizing and heartbreaking.

Matti Salminen's performance of King Marke is a major highlight of this performance, though most people don't pay much attention to it. His enormoud voice is fully under control and his perceptive interpretation runs the gamut of the emotions Wagner wrote him: Hurt, anger, disappointment, restrained compassion....was it Otto Wesendonck  that first expressed this outpouring of a cuckolded king and betrayed foster father?

Hanna Schwarz, one of the best contraltos of her time is an excellent Brangne. Herman Becht, less well known than some of his contemporaries, sings Kurwenal's first act bluster with power and security. His third act is full of delicate tenderness and concern. The smaller parts are taken by the always excellent Bayreuth regulars, with Robert Schunk doubling the young sailor and Melot, as is traditional.

Video quality is antiquated. Snow afflicts much of the black screen areas and colors seem washed out compared to modern digital and HD techniques. But this is a great, if flawed staging, and an excellent musical performance.",1309478400,4,5281,4.930258717660292
2797928,3,B000OONQ1W,"The first thing that struck me about this production was its unremitting darkness. Admittedly, the two lovers sing lustily in the 2nd Act about their transition from day to night, the latter being when their affection flourishes most, but it seems a little perverse to take their injunction so much to heart as to add a further element of tribulation to what is already a highly demanding operatic experience. Paradoxically, there is not much of  opera about the experience at all, but rather a film noir based on a myth that seems to be photographed ( and not very well at that ) in black and white with occasional patches of colour. At no time are we given the feeling of being in the theatre: not a glimpse of the stage, the orchestra, the conductor, or even the chorus: in the great scene where Melot and Mark burst in upon the lovers after the hunt, only these four are framed by the camera; where are the hordes of huntsmen whose horns set up such a din at the opening of the act? Likewise, in the finale, Mark, Melot, Brangane and half the army of Cornwall are supposed to invade the domain of the dying lovers, but the entire scene focuses only upon the latter two and the King himself. No audience; no curtain calls; no applause. Views of the sea, forests and clouds appear that I cannot believe could possible have been created within the confines of a stage, but must surely have been artificially added during editing.

The pity of it is that Ponnelle's staging and direction seem to be inspirational. The sets have a darkly mysterious magic that admirably convey the intense emotions of the protagonists and the cruelty of the fate they have brought upon themselves. The acting is the finest of any Wagnerian production that I have experienced, doubtless a combination of Ponnelle's directorial persuasion and the mercifully non-Wagnerian physical presence of  Meier ( for the most part ) and Kollo ( in every respect ).  Their love-making is unrestrained and convincing, and through it all they are still able to project the raw beauty of the music. What a shame that the camera makes such a travesty of their achievements at crucial moments, as when at the height of  the love duet in Act ll, they disappear from view leaving the screen to show nothing other than the trees and the subtitles while the glorious sound continues relentlessly from the depths of the forest. In the final act, as they live out there last tortured moments together on this earth, the camera shrinks them to the dimensions of small ceramic dwarfs such as are found in chic gardens, without expanding the rest of the scenery. This trick may be intended to symbolise the insignificance of man compared with the immensity of the natural world, but I doubt that Wagner, that prolific creator of Giants and Heros would have had that in mind, nor do I see how these visual distractions could reflect what is actually happening upon a real stage. The long list of video credits conceals the identity of the actual perpetrator of these travesties.

Sufficient comments, most of them highly complimentary, have been lavished by other reviewers upon the fine musical quality of the performances. First and foremost come Barenboim and the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra who are very well served by the recording engineers. Their interpretation of the vast score is exemplary and is not surpassed by any of the competition; and to think that the conductor is a citizen of a country that has banned performance of the composer's compositions!  Vocally, Kollo's interpretation matches his acting, making him the most persuasive Tristan on video. Meier does better than most of her rivals until the very last, when she turns in a tired and leaden rendering of the Liebestod that seems to infect the orchestra accordingly ( or vice-versa ), but the other principals are in top form throughout, especially Hermann Becht who takes on a heroic demeanour as the real hero sinks deeper into the Underworld. This performance should not be written off, but deserves to be approached with caution and certainly has much to offer despite the irritations described.",1304467200,6,4128,4.822033898305085
2797929,4,B000OONQ1W,"First, I should note that I approach opera DVD's with a dismay. A good opera production is already well staged, and needs no more camera work than an occasional swing of focus, as when, well placed in the audience, one turns one's head to see what's happening elsewhere on stage. One doesn't need close ups that show that the actors are older or fatter or uglier than the characters, or that that their finery is pinchbeck. Nor does one want a ""cinematic"" version, with good attractive actors lip-synching, since it's impossible to concentrate on the music when there's a movie going on. I believe an opera should be about the music, with the actors standing heiratically, like figures in a tableau vivant, occasionally characterizing with eloquent gesture. After all, why compound the annoyance of jarring innovations in costume, trimmed recitatives, and all the stupidity a director can muster, more nuisance from a director who thinks he's Kubrick -- when you canenjoy the opera undisturbed on a CD?

All this being said, Ponnelle restrains himself as much as he can, and the costumes and sets are unexceptionable, save for the stupid parachute-sail in act one. More often than not one can see what a magnificent production this was, how fine the acting, and certainly the quality of the orchestra and singers is world class. In a stellar cast all giving amazing performances (super-connoisseurs will quibble of course) one should particularly watch for Matti Salminem, whose Mark at the end of act two is revietting!

This is a Deutsche Gramophone production, with subtitles in German and multiple translations. Anyone else would give it 5 stars, and this is certainly worth seeing a few times.",1295913600,,1698,5.0177304964539005

However, I cannot understand the praises for Johanna Meier, she's one of the weakest Isolde I have heard, sounding very old and husky and lacking the fire and brilliance I expect from a Isolde. She alone pulls down this Tristan greatly. Kollo and Schwartz are not bad but neither are they fantastic, both vocally and visually. Add in the aged video quality and I don't find this Tristan to be a must have.

Overall, if you are picky about production and detest the new school of opera production then it's hard not to recommend this DVD to you.

2797931,4,B000OONQ1W,"A positive review which I recently read elsewhere states: ""If modern directors have something they want to say, then they should write their own operas, and stop using Wagner to peddle their worthless ideas.""
Absolutely. They need to remember that their job is to direct; not to deride, distort or disfigure.
Directing begins with understanding your raw material, not changing it.
Where would we be, for example, if some modern Shakespearean director decided that he wanted to launch a series of old Will's complete works in Stratford, but in Chinese and actually IN the river Avon? - to make them more relevant to today's political sensibilities, you understand...? Well, a lot of drowned actors, ruined costumes, vanished props and British people wanting their tickets refunded is where we would be.
I appreciate the effort which went into a rare attempt to create a world of mysterious adventure in this ""Tristan"". Recent ""Ring"" cycles have suffered far worse fates, and, frankly, when Wagner says that three Rhinemaidens swim around Alberich and tease him, I want them to look good, I want them to look as if they are swimming and I want them to tease him. We all know what teasing is, we all recognize pretty and flirtatious females and we all have considerable experience of what swimming is about, so what do we gain by fixing three Rhinematrons to the floor, leaving Alberich to flop around in a very earth-bound way, pretending he is having a hard time catching them? Can it really be that the technology of more than a hundred years after the first performances of these works does not come anywhere near achieving Wagner's aims? Or are we just saving money?
I very much fear that the Bayreuth of the future will be a web site with beautiful swimming Rhinemaidens, beautifully synchronized voices and a beautiful digital simulation of the acoustics in the Festspielhaus.
But perhaps I should welcome it; Wagner probably would, if he knew what travesties had been perpetrated in his name since 1883... But when we remember that the music always comes first, there is actually very little to spoil this fine set of discs.",1256688000,6,2129,4.900277008310249
2797932,5,B000OONQ1W,"It's quite remarkable that Daniel Baremboim has three DVD productions of ""Tristan und Isolda"" to his credit. I don't think any other conductor has been so honored that they have been chosen by Wagner's family or executors of his estate to preside over three productions of Wagner's greatest music drama. I haven't heard the later two productions, so I can't comment on them, and on which is the best of the three, but I can state that the current DVD production for DG is certainly one of the finest of this work either on CD or DVD. The singing of all of the principles is magnificient, and all the others are extremely good. Rene Kollo has a ringing tone with no flab on it, and his physical presence is totally convincing. This is what Tristan, the character, should look like.  The sets and costumes are all excellent, too, creating a symbolic world of myth and poetry, because that's what this work is: a great poem on the transcendent powers of love. The Jungian tree symbolism is very beautiful.  The surround sound is powerful, and picture quality is very fine.  Just watch the atmospheric presentation of the well-known Prelude to Act 1, with its depection of a pre-dawn scene on the coast of Cornwall in some unspecified ancient mythic time, and you're hooked.  This is an essential DVD which every music lover should have, even if you already own the CDs with Bohm/Neilson or Furtwangler/Flagstad.  The only question is whether one can afford the other two Baremboim versions. This one is certainly heavenly.",1241740800,10,1519,4.782442748091603

In this wonderful DVD we have an excellent orchestra by Baremboim with a wet creamy grandeur which he does not acchieve for instance in Bruckner. Of course J.Meier is not B.Nilsson,but she works. As for R. Kollo,he is also well placed,without his unpleasent trebles,since Tristan is not exactly bel canto. Of course there are some boring moments at Act 3,due to Wagners prolixity ,typical  of a time when idle aristocracy could spend seven hours inside Bayreuth Festspielhaus.

2797935,1,B000OONQ1W,"Having heard and read so much praise I expected much more from the Ponnelle/Barenboim ""Tristan und Isolde"" from the Bayreuth Festival of 1981. For one thing, the DVD's video quality is extremely disappointing. Darkness is extremely grainy. Even bleeding most of the color out the video, the quality is that of early VHS which is not good.

Ponnelle's direction and designs are overly quirky and the sets are extremely ugly looking. The opening scene with Isolde on the floor with a cape spreading out covering most of the stage and wearing a ridiculous looking crown (which she rips up after the Narration and Curse) set the tone for most of the balance of the performance, which is a series of misfires better known as opera singers behaving badly.  Isolde running about the stage at the beginning of act two in a state of pre-orgasmic ecstasy eventually hitting the ground grinding her body into the ground and simulating having Tristan on top of her is just so silly looking, I couldn't wait for it to pass.  Tristan and Isolde looking lovingly at their image in an onstage pond during the Liebestnach was annoying in its reference to their narcissism sapping most of the erotic nature of the duet. I did like Ponnelle's revisionist ending having Isolde disappearing following the Liebestod and after a blackout before the final tableaux. Tristan imagined her return. The lights come up again with Kurvenal holding Tristan's corpse creating a truly heart wrenching scene.  The only emotional moment in over four hours.  No this is not what Wagner had wanted but after reading Ernest Newman's analysis of the opera, where he goes into great detail about the miserable life Tristan had lead, it made sense.

I never understood what gave Johanna Meier the impression that she was a dramatic soprano. She was a lovely Mozart and Strauss specialist during her City Opera days, with a voice more suited for Eva and Elsa, here she's swamped for the most part by Isolde's music. She does act the role well but she's around fifty percent deficient in vocal heft. This was the first time I saw Rene Kollo in action and I was less impressed than I thought I would be. Also with a modest voice, he more or less makes up with acting ability what he can't make up in volume. He plays Tristan as a manic depressive. Hanna Schwarz is also small scaled as Braganne. Hermann Becht, who I happen to like very much, was excellent as Kurwenal but the real ""Wagnarian"" sound was only delivered by Matti Salminen, here in his prime and wonderful as Marke.

Barenboim's conducting strays to the bombastic side easily swallowing up Meier and Kollo especially in the first portion of the love duet. But there's drive and tension throughout his reading.

This is not a performance I can see myself going back to often and it may end up on eBay sooner than later. But I will give it at least one more try, now that I know what to expect and what not to expect.",1205107200,25,2935,4.6854368932038835
2797936,5,B000OONQ1W,"This is indeed a very satisfying performance of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. It is a performance filmed on the stage of Bayreuth, but without the audience, in order to give the camera a greater freedom of movement. The staging of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, shows you clearly what a good director could achieve, as opposed to the intolerable nonsense one has so often to put up with some modern productions.
The prelude depicts a misty shore with a calm sea and some rocks in the water. Mist comes and goes with the music. The picture is almost black and white, until the sun rises and lifts part of the mist to leave us somewhere in the middle of the sea. One may presume the Irish Sea.
In Act I this mist disappears and we are shown something that resembles a ship but looks more like an island, with a cave and a tree up front. Isolde wears an enormous dress, which almost traps her in and she has to set herself free.
In Act II we are shown an enormous tree, under which all the action takes place. The tree is lit up differently according to the mood of the Opera and of course there is night to begin with and daylight at the end. There is a wonderful meadow with a spring in front of the tree, which adds to the poetry of the setting.
In Act III, we have another tree, which is thunderstruck and serves at the centre point of the stage. Everything is as described by Wagner until Isolde's ship arrives. Then you realise that this has not really happened and it is Tristan who in his delirium imagines it all. He watches all the proceedings until Isolde's Liebestod when at the end her image fades away and he dies on the last note of the Opera.
As to the principals now, Daniel Barenboim conducts the Bayreuth Orchestra very elegantly with a lot of emotion and drama. Johanna Meier sings well and acts reasonably well as Isolde. Her voice is not of the calibre of past great Wagnerian sopranos like Flagstad or Nilsson or even more recently Polaski, but one cannot complain. Rene Kollo as Tristan appears with a face indifferent to the happenings in the Opera. His acting on the whole is on the poor side but his voice is certainly adequate. Hanna Schwarz as Brangane is wonderful as usual, both to listen and to watch. The rest are good with Matti Salminen as King Marke vocally towering above the others.
The image quality is good for the 80's but perhaps for a filmed performance one might have expected something better. The sound is very good.
Of the existing productions of Tristan und Isolde on DVD you will be hard pressed to find a better one. The Bohm DVD with Nilsson and Wingassen may sound more promising, but its image quality s terrible. As to the modern productions, if you want to see anything resembling the story that Wagner presented, then forget it!

2797937,3,B000OONQ1W,"Johanna Meier's Isolde brings to mind the famous story of Melba's Brunnhilde, her lovely sound inaudible beyond the front rows.  Meier's sound is probably less lovely and more audible than Melba's.  Hers is a warm, slightly fluttery, lyric voice.  She sings accurately and with appealing legato.  But she's a fragile waif against a surging orchestra, incapable of showing Isolde's pride, anger, passion, ecstasy.  Rene Kollo is more convincing as Tristan.  He doesn't sound heroic.  But Tristan's not that heroic a character, especially in this production where he's doom-laden from the start.  Meier and Kollo both look good, if somewhat haunted.

The production isn't one of those ingenious resettings.  I often like them if they only change the look and preserve the sense.  This one retains Wagner's settings, less the castle in Brittany.  But it perversely alters the sense at the end.  Tristan lives on beyond his death in the stage directions.  He has to live so that he can dream Isolde's return and love-death.  Ponnelle also used a dream gimmick in his ""Dutchman"".  There it merely framed the story, yet it remained the ""Dutchman"" story.  Here the dream changes the story.  This ""Tristan"" isn't about two souls love-fused so that neither can survive the other's extinction.  It's about a melancholy romantic who dreams of his lover as he expires alone.",1201910400,7,1362,5.109090909090909
2797938,4,B000OONQ1W,"This is one of those productions that might be better without the video. Although I find no fault with the singing and conducting, the staging and scenery seem to be more about expressing the director's ego than about the opera.",1201737600,,228,4.725
2797939,5,B000OONQ1W,"In spite of the lack of hugh voices that have dominated Tristan in the past, the cast of the Barenboim Tristan reflects the lack of what we would think of as truly Wagnerian.  This is also true of Barenboim Ring, John Tomlinson excepted.  In fact, the reviewer in the Metropolitan Guide, Jon Alan Conrad, refers to this performance as ""Tristan Lite"".  Even so it is a document to the art of Johanna Meier an undervalued, under used and underrated artist.  Ideally the heaviest Wagnerial role she should sung would have been Elsa, Elizabeth Sieglinde and Eva. Having said that she sings a very beautiful lyrica Isolde.  The production is magical and the Brangane and Tristan  are evenly matched in terms of vocal decibals with the leading lady.  Kollo makes a handsome Tristan and is clearly taxed, but not to the detriment of the performance.

Critics at the time felt that the production would have served Hansel and Gretel, so yes, there is a magical element that is quite beautiful. The camera, however, is unkind to Meier, making her look older than she was.  The voice, however, is youthful, beautiful and appropriate given the parameters of this production.  Ponnelle's conceit about the third act--Isolde isn't really a presence but appears only in Tristan's imagination so that after the Liebestod Isolde disappears. This is Bayreuth so I suppose a director is expected to bring something different to the table.  Ultimately this is a minor point and one that is easily disregarded.  Given the competition (the Vickers/Nilsson Orange performance excepted) this is easily the best Tristan in the catalogue.  This may change when Opus Arte releases the Glyndebourne production with Stemme but for the nonce this is a performance that is essentially conservative, well sung and acted given the current state of Wagner singing today.",1195603200,13,1837,5.043046357615894
2797940,5,B000OONQ1W,"Although Wagner looked on 'Tristand und Isolde' as a tragedy, there is much to be said for this lushly romantic view of one of the greatest works in the operatic canon.
  Kollo's 'hyper' acting in the last act apart, it is a pleasure to view and Barenboim's early take on the score is the perfect accompaniment.  Perhaps it is his unfamiliarity with the score that leads him to forego 'the depths' of the music and simply keep it moving with a romantic gloss totally keeping with Ponnelle's visual concept.
  In Ponnelle's world, there are, apparently, no chairs and so you get the singers either standing or rolling around on the floor (only the shepherd gets to sit on a conveniently shaped tree root) which causes some strain on the singers but nothing that should make anyone interested in this opera hesitate.
  The singing is excellent.  Kollo is not the Heltentenor of one's dreams but he's handsome and navigates (and scales down) the vocal line.  Meier (an American) is more in the mold of the silver voiced Traubel and her appearance enhances the romance aimed for by the entire production.
  The Prelude is accompanied by a visual of the sea that I could watch again and again.  Classical MTV at it's best.  Some other of Ponnelle's visual 'stamps' don't quite come off but they are so fleeting (in an opera almost four hours in length) that they hardly matter.
  All the other currently available visual presentations of this opera, with their visual and aural shortcomings, must, I'm afraid, take their places far behind this one for the sheer enjoyment of a magnificent score.",1194566400,12,1590,4.794117647058823
2797941,4,B000OONQ1W,"Amazon reviewers of this Jean-Pierre Ponnelle ""Tristan"" are consistently hailing it as the best on DVD.  It certainly has its merits and will likely hold the field against its competition in the Amazon catalog for a while.  Nonetheless, my personal choice for the finest ""Tristan"" available on DVD remains Daniel Barenboim's second Bayreuth effort: Heiner Muller's restrained, abstracted, but strangely beautiful and ultimately moving version, with an attractive, passionate pair of lovers in Siegfried Jerusalem and, especially, the beautiful Waltraud Meier, both of them assuming these roles for the first time (Meier's Isolde is definitely not ""wasted"" here, as one reviewer complained about her appearance in the notorious Peter Konwitschny ""yellow sofa"" DVD).  Unfortunately, for the time being Amazon does not offer this production, and the only DVD version currently available comes with minimal packaging, a slightly soft video image, and, sadly, no subtitles (along with an unbeatable price). If nothing else, though, a comparison of the two productions further underscores the strengths and weaknesses of the Ponnelle.

That earlier Bayreuth staging definitely appears as the more overtly ""romantic,"" naturalistic (albeit highly stylized), and ultimately conservative (save of course for the famous ending).  Ponnelle coaxes committed though not always entirely subtle performances from his principals.  Johanna Meier is a formidable vocal artist, if a bit matronly (in purely visual terms, it is hard to escape the impression that she should be the Brangane to Hanna Schwarz's Isolde).  Rene Kollo similarly sings with distinction and looks striking all in black, though I don't find him quite as convincing a young warrior and lover as does another reviewer.  The aforementioned Hanna Schwarz has long been a favorite of mine, and I was privileged to see one of Matti Salminen's first Met performances of King Marke many years ago.  Their presence, along with the assured conducting of Barenboim (though perhaps not quite up to the stature he would later attain in this work), contribute to making this the most recommendable ""Tristan"" in the Amazon catalog.  It would not hurt for prospective buyers to bear in mind, though, that the Muller production is also available, and at a bargain price--if only as a contrast and complement to the Ponnelle.",1193529600,10,2361,5.443835616438356
2797942,5,B000OONQ1W,"I have just watched this Tristan and Isolde on DVD. I was not disappointed, Its a sound production with both Kollo and Meier in fine voice. This has to be the definitive filmed version so far. Wonderful stuff!",1192838400,6,209,4.526315789473684
2797943,3,B000OONQ1W,"Since I agree with most of the positive comments from other writers there's no need for me to repeat them. However I'd like to explain what keeps me from finally endorsing this film. I'm speaking about the final twenty minutes or so where director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle superimposes a contrivance that in my view confuses the viewer and recklessly discards what the composer himself intended as the essence of his work.

Aside from the opening scene, where Isolde is introduced as marriage chattel  ---- looking like the focal point of a maypole, and with a sort of wedding cake on her head --- Ponnelle is on remarkably good behavior. This holds thru the climax of Tristan's final delirium in Act 3 where, in a suicidal gesture, he tears off his bandages to greet the approaching Isolde. So far so good!

Then surprisingly, instead of Isolde's long-anticipated entrance, what we get is an extreme close up of Tristan's anguished face. Meanwhile we merely hear Isolde's frenzied arrival, off-camera, and that pathetic little whimper Wagner wrote for her when she realizes Tristan has died, a heartbreaking moment totally lost here due to Ponnelle's confusing camera placement. When we finally see Isolde it's in a long shot, with Tristan sitting upright in front of her! Yes, supposedly after he's died! Tristan is then viewed lying down in Isolde's arms, then sitting up again. The bewildered viewer may be wondering if there's a defective disk in the machine!

After more confusion upon the entrance of others, a standing Isolde sings her Liebestod, an intimate moment shot here at an unorthodox distance and with Tristan, still very much alive, sitting on the ground.  During the music's final orchestral bars there's a sudden fade to black. But before the curtain closes the lights come up again on Tristan lying in Kurvenal's arms --- now presumably dead ---- but with no Isolde in sight!

This is no small matter! Ponnelle's unique staging suggests that everything that happens after Tristan's final fit --- including Isolde's arrival and her famous embrace of death's sweet balm ---  is simply a figment of Tristan's feverish brain, a device that scuttles conventional expectation at this point and draws attention instead to a novelty of the stage director. The very camera seems at a loss over how to shoot it, causing all the wrong questions to overtake the viewer. Has Tristan survived his wound? Will he and Isolde not die, but live happily ever after?  And what has actually happened to all the other characters?

Having Isolde and others appear only in Tristan's imagination during the last act unbalances the opera's plot structure.  (For one thing, the tragic irony of Marke's actual forgiveness is now meaningless) Most disastrously, it subverts Wagner's expression of the existential death of both lovers as his ultimate solution to the universal problem of suffering-through-longing.

Having enjoyed everything immensely up to this point, I hoped that familiarity with this novel ending in subsequent viewings might eliminate my negative reaction.  And though this did lessen my initial shock and confusion, it failed significantly to removed my dissatisfaction.

Mr. Ponnelle seems to like operas which allow him to interpret actions as the dreams and imaginings of their characters. I'm all for new takes on old works, even when they're controversial. . But I'm sorry to say  that during the critical final moments of this film I find little distinction  between what's innovative and what's merely meretricious, and that Wagner's music drama  just seems to end badly.

2797944,5,B000OONQ1W,"FINALLY, I'm getting a chance to review this DVD. Having preordered the item before its official release date, which was two months ago, I just received my Tristan und Isolde yesterday. However, I'm not going to shortchange the production itself on account of Amazon's colossal blunder, because this DVD is definitely worth the wait!

Several other reviewers have already made all the important comments regarding this production, so I just want to add my voice to theirs. I own three DVDs of this opera, and this is the best Tristan und Isolde I have seen, based on the understated, lush compatibility, as well as the dreamlike beauty of the production, and on the consistency of the performances. This one comes closest to what I believe were Wagner's intentions(well, except for the ending) and is definitely worth owning. Probably the highest compliment I can pay it is this: I am eagerly looking forward to watching it again, and how many four hour DVDs can you say that about?

Rene Kollo in his prime was probably the Tristan of choice at that time, and watching and listening to this it's easy to see why. His voice has all the qualities one expects from a Tristan, beautiful, lyrical, also stentorian, plus he is physically convincing as a young warrior and lover. His expressive face captures all the right moods, from passion to guilt to madness and finally peace. Johanna Meier's Isolde is captivating from her very first note onward, she has a beautiful voice, singing Wagner instead of screaming it. I must say, however, that her rendition of the liebestod is probably the subtlest, most softspoken(softsung?) I have ever heard. Not that it isn't beautiful...I still had goosebumps...but she is so ethereal she is occasionally overpowered by the orchestra. It's a fine reading, and a lovely alternative, just not your typical liebestod in the forceful, passionate manner of Flagstad or Nilsson, or for that matter Eaglen or Polaski, who sing the role of Isolde on the other DVDs of this opera which I own. People familiar with my reviews know that I am an avid champion of Matti Salminen, and nothing about his performance here alters that opinon. He makes King Marke even more of a sympathetic character than usual, with his wounded, soulful voice and countenance. Daniel Barenboim's conducting is somewhat schizophrenic, very slow at times, then, seemingly at the drop of a hat, revved  up to the extreme. I enjoyed the juxtapositions very much. And by the way, the orchestra sounds great, despite the tendency to occasionally drown out the singers. With orchestration this powerful, it's probably difficult to resist that urge for a full four hours. After all, the singers are allowed their time in the sun, why shouldn't the orchestra?

I'd like to conclude with some comments on Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's staging, which is lovely and eerie and dreamlike. Certain effects stand out. For instance, in act two, when Tristan and Isolde act out their long, stirring love duet under a large glimmering tree, the head of the tree is filled with lights that resemble eyes and even faces. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I personally appreciated the effect, giving the impression that the lovers, even during their moment of supreme bliss, are under constant surveillance. Someone else mentioned how effective it is actually seeing the shepherd as he plays his wounded lament at the opening of act three, and I'd like to second that. Finally, regarding the ending, I found it very effective, at least as a one-time thing. If I were unfamiliar with the opera before watching this, though, I might have assumed Ponnelle's conceit jibes with Wagner's intentions, which it doesn't. I don't want to give too much away, because actually seeing this ending is a breathtaking surprise, I just want to caution first time viewers that this is not concordant with the composer's libretto. It is, however, a lush, fanciful, sad, ultimately beautiful touch, cinematic in fact, even if it does take away from some of the growth we have witnessed in a couple of the key characters, particularly King Marke.

I didn't intend to go on this long  since the other reviewers did such a good job of talking this DVD up; like Wagner, I can't help getting carried away sometimes. Elvis had an album called A Thousand Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong, or something like that. Well, a thousand Tristan und Isolde fans can't be wrong, either. To exercise the very non-Wagnerian practice of being succinct: go for it.",1191369600,57,4500,4.930079155672823

Nothing much happens in this opera, there is no real action and so you see the same greyish scenery, sometimes even ""snowy"" throughout the whole production. It is a little tedious to watch. Tristan and Isolde is a difficult opera. There are not too many catchy arias as, say in Verdi's or Puccini's operas, and with monotonous background, you really have only the principles to hear and observe.

Likewise, with opera, all elements, cast, music, execution, scenery, stagecraft, and so fort, must both blend and lift the audience beyond the reality of everyday life. This Bayreuth production reaches this lofty goal. Never have I experienced the magic of performance as presented by Rene Kollo and Johanna Meier as Tristan and Isolde. Visually, both singing artists become one with the characters they portray. You don't have to stretch the limits of your imagination to accept these two singers as the young lovers they are supposed to be. Above all, vocally, both singers...but especially Johanna Meier...overwhelm us with supernal tone and convincing passion. Johann Meyer's tone is pure, shimmering gold. Her voice allows you to understand why Tristan would be so completely entranced by her, love potion or not. I found myself mesmerized by the power of their magic. There is no brassy bellowing, no forcing or stridency in the upper registers, just a constant flow of voice meeting every emotional nuance and vocal demand of the composer. What an experience. What a beautiful Isolde! What singing! The rest of the cast is equally magnificent. My only dissapointment has to do with the ending. In the original legend, Isolde comes to the dying Tristan as a flesh and blood woman. In Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's version, the ending is all a dream as Tristan suffers his dying moments without the presence of his beloved Isolde. What a betrayal of Wagner's intent.

2797949,4,B000OONQ1W,"This is the best video presentation of Tristan currently available.  Kollo and Meier at least approach my imagination's idea of what Tristan and Isolde look might look like.  The staging is innovative without being too ""modern."" Barenboim's conducting is superb with the orchestra sounding luxuriant.  I was totally absorbed by the drama and emotionally exhausted at its end.

My reason for not awarding this 5 stars are two:

1) The quality of the video varies throughout the presentation.  It seems that video technology used at Bayreuth in 1983 (when the opera was recorded) was not up to changing lighting conditions.  When the camera moves from a close up to the whole stage, dark areas in the picture fill with video artifacts similar to light ""snow.""  At other times the picture is nearly perfect, mostly when there is little contrast between light and dark areas of the screen.  The impact of this is not too annoying, but it can be distracting. One can compensate for this somewhat with picture settings on a DVD player or monitor, but image sharpness may be lost.

2) I listened to the video in DTS 5.1 sound (the other alternative is PCM stereo).  According to the DVD booklet this performance was recorded in a special session without an audience so there is no coughing or other distracting noises, and no applause at the end of acts.  The sound stage favors the orchestra (which for this opera I heartily approve) so that the voices are sometimes submerged in the overall sound. While the sound quality is generally superb, the level of sound varies from scene to scene.  Loud passages seem more distant, while softer passages jump out.  One wishes the sound was a bit more uniform throughout.  The recording engineers should have been able to correct this. However this may be an artifact of the DTS presentation (in which sound is artificially sent to rear speakers if the original wasn't recorded with ambient sound microphones - which I believe this recording didn't use: compare the sound with the recently issued Barenboim Ring cycle which did use ambient mikes).

Regardless of these caveats, this is the Tristan video to have.",1187654400,19,2148,4.892265193370166

I am fed up struggling with oversize and overaged Mimi's - Tosca's - Butterflies etc. who sing divinely but under no circumstances visually represent the characters they are acting.

Not here - Meier ""is"" Isolde and I can well imagine Tristan losing his heart to her without Brangane's potion! Terrific singing by all. What a treat",1461110400,,485,4.914634146341464

8185823,5,B000OONQ1W,"This is a truly luminous recording, both in terms of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's dramatic staging, and of course the intensity of the singing.  Johanna Meier is a strong Isolde, and Rene Kollo is a very expressive Tristan.  The staging and the singing combine to truly draw the viewer into the scene.",1442448000,4,295,4.88
8185824,5,B000OONQ1W,"I love everything about this production.  I am so glad that I did not heed the few negative reviews.  Great singing, great orchestral playing, magical production!  Everything I was seeing on the screen mirrored what I was hearing in the music.  There were a few unexpected concepts, such as Tristan being apparently still alive at the conclusion of the liebestod, but it worked.",1441411200,6,378,4.9523809523809526

8185826,4,B000OONQ1W,Was it intentional for Isolde's crown to fall off at the end of Act I when she bows to Marke?  It made me giggle!,1416960000,,113,3.7083333333333335

8185828,4,B000OONQ1W,"Musically, this is the best, not a doubt about it.  Stupendous singing , conducting, playing.  Bayreuth at its height, which needs no further comment.

Of course, this being post-WW2, the staging and costumery leave something to be desired.  Isolde's monstrous dress at the beginning of Act 1 is absurd - it covers literally the entire stage - and the director's interpretation of act 3 as Tristan's delusion has its problems, depicting Tristan as some kind of narcissist - but hey, look at the alternatives out there.  The Met's offering has a sadly overweight Isolde so Tristan also had to be made to look obese to 'fit in' - and act 2 staging is hugely disappointing with that illuminated outhouse and all.  Beautiful act 1 though.  Act 3 is ridiculous with the hobby horsies and all.

The other DVD's are the usual Eurotrash/Regietheater and not worthy of comment.",1386288000,,868,4.857142857142857
