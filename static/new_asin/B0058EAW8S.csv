The picture quality stinks and the group that put this on the market should be put in prison. Save your money and do not buy this rip off.",1477612800,,288,4.254545454545455
8461423,5,B0058EAW8S,"Two very rare horror films I had never heard of. I know they were actually released under 3 different titles each. I think the werewolf one was a made for TV movie, my father says he remembers seeing it a long time ago.
Nice quality for such old material, he bought it for me and we enjoyed it a lot :-)",1470873600,,303,3.9836065573770494
8461424,1,B0058EAW8S,"This is a fraudulent product. These movies are Silent Night, Bloody Night, and Moon Wolf. There is a single screen shot of the misleading titles, then right into the 70's movies, with no opening credits, so as to deceive you. But don't give these crooks your money. These movies are on mostly every multi pack there is.",1451606400,3,319,4.614035087719298
