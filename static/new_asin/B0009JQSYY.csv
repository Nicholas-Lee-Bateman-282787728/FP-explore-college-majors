2295834,5,B0009JQSYY,"It is a great set to have.  They are the same personality and motivational strategies as the TAE BO , but completely different workout. I was sore for 3 days and I am a marathon runner.  He works out your butte and legs to the max. It is for people who are serious about getting into shape.  It is common callisthenics, but with a Billy Blanks twist. I ordered mine from QVC and it came with and extra lower body dvd.  So 5 dvds, billy bands and a 7day plan came for $37.00 shipping and tax included.  It is a great deal........",1127174400,18,528,4.137254901960785
2295835,5,B0009JQSYY,"I have lost over 40 pounds and 40 inches using Billy's Boot Camp combined with ""traditional"" Tae Bo!  These workouts WILL get you in shape!",1127174400,3,139,4.56
2295836,3,B0009JQSYY,"I bought this thinking it would be more like Billy's other workouts.  This is less aerobic and much more toning oriented.  Lots of leg lifts, sit ups etc.  It is a thorough work out but a lot of it I could do on my own, I want Billy to think up all those great combinations for me!",1126137600,4,281,3.8947368421052633
2295837,5,B0009JQSYY,"I just received this 4 DVD set in the mail a few days ago.  I love it!  The set comes with Basic, Advanced, Cardio, and Abs.  a 7-day diet plan and ""Billy-bands"" are included.

I do about 60 minutes cardio a day and needed a different routine; I definitely found it with these videos.  Billy Blanks is a great motivator, he sticks with the boot camp theme and surrounds himself with hyperactive muscular fitness folk who are very enthusiastic about doing crunches and push-ups.  It's all to the good though, since the workout is indeed challenging and fun.  The hour flew  by and I felt as though Billy had pretty much beat me to a pulp by the end of the beginner basic workout.  He does instruct you very well on the proper method of doing the various exercises and ways to adjust the routine to your fitness level (ie don't use the billy-bands at first).  The routine is calisthenic and cardio; a nice mix of his tae-bo moves, paired with standard military basic training fare such as the crab-walk, flutter-kicks, push-ups, and jumping-jacks. The billy bands are added with such exercises as curls and flys. Each routine works your entire body, every single muscle group.  The Billy-bands are easy to use and provide the perfect amount of resistance, but can be adjusted by wrapping them around your shoes or hands for even greater resistance.  Emphasis is placed on posture and propewr positioning to prevent injury and there are pre and post workout stretching sessions.

The success plan is just an insert that describes a 7-day diet plan that you can use to kick-start your weight loss.  It is a reasonable plan to follow, using easy to prepare foods.  For example, it might say to eat one egg and a grapefruit for breakfast, a turkey wrap with spinach and low fat cheese for lunch, apple with peanut butter for a snack, etc.  It certainly isn't comprehensive, but it's a good basic guide.

I would definitely recommend this DVD set to any fully-mobile, highly motivated, and spry individual.  I would not recommend this program for anyone with back or knee problems or a poor sense of balance.  If you can bounce around for an hour, this workout should be allright for you.  I have enjoyed it so far and am looking forward to advancing to the harder DVDs and getting super thin, in which case I will update this review.  :-)",1120521600,20,2332,4.639024390243902
8062068,5,B0009JQSYY,"By now you know everyone thinks this is one of the greatest movies in the cinema. It is described as realistic, and has great camera work. You could probably go on forever about the actors and the directors and so forth. What is really interesting is they are all correct; this is one of the best sub movies ever. And you do get swallowed up in the action. There are other movies that can rival this one. Yet it does not diminish what was accomplished here.

The base story is the daily lives of an Unterseeboot crew. It shows the trials and tribulations they must go through to accomplish their missions. One thing you can be sure of is that this is not an anti war movie. They would not be there if they were not hunters.

You do get the feel of what it is like when the hunters become the hunted.

8062071,5,B0009JQSYY,Billy Blanks Boot camp dvd's is the best.  Never have to worry about going to the gym. I've lost 62 pounds and have sooooo much energy. I've made the Ultimate boot camp DVD part of life.,1411344000,,186,4.166666666666667
8062072,5,B0009JQSYY,This workout is great! I have been doing it for a week and I can already see some great results! The cast is fun and motivating throughout the whole workout. It works me out without breaking my bones. I have knee problems and cannot run long distance anymore. This is a fun alternative to that. I look forward to being encouraged and challenged by Billy and the Team every time!,1173398400,,378,4.414285714285715
8062073,2,B0009JQSYY,"I purchased combo dvd from Wal-Mart stores The dvd's repeatly kept skipping and therefore I wasn't able to obtain a good workout. Once the dvd's were purchased and opened, they cannot be returned, only exchanged. I did exchanged the dvd for the exact item, only to learn that the dvd were skipping. I had to visit the store on three seprate occassions due to the dvd's repeatly kept skipping. I would like to be assured that if I were to purchase my workout dvd through mail, that I would not get any defected dvd. I looking forward to a prompt response to this matter.",1168992000,,569,4.480769230769231
8062074,2,B0009JQSYY,"I will say the positive things first. I do agree that it is a good workout and will tone your body gradually, which is healthy. Here are my complaints. I felt this workout was disorganized. Billy often stops to talk to you to try to motivate you but he is so out of breath that it sounds like a mouthfull of nothing. Also, billy is so busy talking that it appears he forgets how many reps per side have been done and many times the reps are unequal (one of my big pet peeves). My final and biggest complaint is that Billy frequently says ""one more set"" and there is more than one. I am not usually one to complain, but I need structure in my workout and this video was too disorganized and sloppy for me.",1149465600,5,704,4.145985401459854
8062075,5,B0009JQSYY,"this is the best workout you can ever get. if you never did it before they will slowly get you to be stronger and fit. But to warn it is hard. there could be some moves that you can't do, but try at it. you will be suprised at what you can do after a week.",1142640000,4,256,3.5892857142857144
8062076,4,B0009JQSYY,"I did not purchase this set here on Amazon because for some reason it is missing the cardio DVD. The set from Costco came with all 4 DVDs and the bands and it was $29.99. I went down to Costco and picked that up and saved on shipping. Not sure why the set from Amazon (or as seen on TV) doesn't have it included. As the 7 day plan includes that workout!

However, this is an awesome set! It will work you out hard and tone your body all over. Billy pulls it off again. I have seen more definition develop on my body than with any other workout. Plus, this is a workout I will do. He has a unique way of motiviating you and it truly keeps me going even when I am tired.

This is not for someone who wants a light workout or has back problems. However, some of his earlier basic workouts might work for someone who isn't as physically fit or needs to build up endurance. I had used the basic workout from his TaeBo II series to get in to shape for the boot camp.

I highly recommend this set (but would recommend you look around for the set that does include the 4th DVD)",1141084800,13,1069,4.033018867924528
8062077,3,B0009JQSYY,"I just received this set. The weekly workout plan lists a cardio dvd that is not included in this set. I already opened the dvds, so I can't get a full refund. Like another member stated, you can get a 5 dvd set elsewhere for $37.68. I wish I would have investigated further before I bought. Very disappointing. I haven't tried the workout yet because I want the cardio dvd so I can follow the plan.",1128211200,19,399,4.2631578947368425
