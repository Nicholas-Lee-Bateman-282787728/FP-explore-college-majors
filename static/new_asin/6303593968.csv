Gerard is the best at period pieces which I own.  You cannot get better than Depardieu, but the story line is so different I am not totally crazy about this one.  It is just me and the type of film it is.",1359936000,,353,3.9295774647887325

The murderer is now in hiding from his former employers (who will kill him too) and the police. He accepts the woman's need to ""reinvent"" him as her dead boyfriend - literally transforming his identity. But can love transform his soul as well?
Techine infuses the classic elements of film noir with a daring moral dimension breaking the shallow boundaries that enervate the multi-hide of lesser contemporary homages to the genre.
