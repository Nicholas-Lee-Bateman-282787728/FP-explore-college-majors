Grownups may find it corny, but this group of characters tackle the issues that are important to twos, threes and young fours:  missing people they love when they go away, valuing people and experiences over things, and just enjoying the everyday pleasures that preschoolers notice and remind us of.  I have read some reviews here indicating that others did not like them, but my son and his friends (almost four) are pretty much obsessed with these delightful characters and the songs and stories they bring.
In addition, the animation is excellent, combining the technology of ""toy story"" (although not quite so creatively applied) with a few real people.
