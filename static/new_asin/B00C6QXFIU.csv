5691931,4,B00C6QXFIU,"They got the perfect people to come discuss each doctor, and it had the special on my first Doctor, Pertwee, so of course I loved it. I just wish they had chosen the episodes differently, like using the newly animated lost episodes or something equally exciting instead of the ones they did. Good episodes, but of course I already have them in my collection, and even if I didn't, they are all episodes that are available via Amazon and NetFlix Instant-Video collections, so that is a lot of $$ for 4 ~45min specials.

I am only taking off one star for this because the specials were awesome, the people from the past who they brought in to talk was incredible to see and hear from, and the overall quality was great. The episodes they chose for each Doctor were tried and true ones, so my qualm is simply because I personally already own them and would have LOVED to see some of the newly remade lost episodes or some other special features integrated into the set.",1374105600,,966,4.488636363636363
5691932,5,B00C6QXFIU,"To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who, BBC Home Entertainment is releasing the best serial from each of the eleven Doctors. The first release features the first four Doctors, William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, and Tom Baker, from the years 1963-1981, each in one classic episode, The Aztecs, Tomb of the Cybermen, The Spearhead From Space, and Pyramids of Mars.

My introduction into the world of Doctor Who was when the episode ""Rose"" aired on the Sci Fi Channel (now known as SyFy) in the spring of 2006. I was aware of the previous series that aired from 1963-1989, but I had never watched an episode before, though I had watched the Peter Cushing's version, Doctor Who and the Daleks and Daleks - Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D., so I was eager to watch the four-disc set, which I received free of charge from BBC Entertainment in exchange for my honest review.

Each episode can be watched in its original four-part version or as a feature presentation with an introduction by Steven Moffat. For a bonus, there is a profile special on each doctor.

The Aztecs stars William Hartnell as a grumpy version of the Doctor, who travels across time in the TARDIS with his granddaughter, Susan Foreman, and their companions, Barbra and Ian. They arrive in the 15th Century Mexico, where the TARDIS get trapped inside a tomb. Barbara gets mistaken for the reincarnation of High Priest Yetaxa by the Aztecs, so she has no other choice but to assume the high priest role, but the High Priest of Sacrifice, Tlotoxl, is not fooled by her arrival and demands a sacrifice to be made.

The Tomb of the Cybermen stars Patrick Troughton as the second Doctor. The serial is currently the only intact serial from Troughton's first two seasons. Along for the adventure are his two companions, Watling and Victoria. The TARDIS lands on the planet Telos, where archeologists have uncovered a secret entrance in a mountain, which is the remains of the Doctor's enemy, the Cybermen, are located. Everything is fine, until the Cybermen are unleashed from their prison cells.

There are several big firsts in the serial Spearhead From Space, as it is the first of the series to be broadcast in color, it is the first full episode with Jon Pertwee playing the Doctor, and it introduces the new villain, the Autons. After being regenerated and exiled to Earth by the Time Lords, the Doctor is recruited by UNIT to help stop an alien invasion.

Tom Baker stars as the scarf-wearing Doctor in Pyramids of Mars along with his companion, Sarah Jane Smith. The TARDIS lands near the Scarman family home in England, now owned by an Egyptian, Ibrahim Namin, who can command mummy robots from their tombs by using a powerful ring. The Doctor and Sarah Jane stumble upon something more sinister than the mummies; it seems an upright sarcophagus is actually a space-time portal, where the last of the alien race Osirian, named Sutekh, is waiting to end all life.

Similar to the original Star Trek series, the early years of Doctor Who had low-budget sets and special effects. I never knew the first doctor was grumpy and somewhat clueless at times. He wastes most of his time flirting with an Aztec woman, when he could have been helping Barbra. The Cybermen's suits are silly, but they are still fun to watch as the second doctor tries to stop them. The Spearhead From Space is my favorite out of the four as it introduces the Autons who later appear in ""Rose"" and the Doctor is forced to stay on Earth. I know the fourth doctor is a fan favorite, but the plot in Pyramids of Mars is a little silly, though the Doctor's chemistry with Sarah Jane makes up for it. Overall, I had a blast watching the origins of Doctor Who and I recommend it to old or new fans.",1373846400,2,3746,4.683890577507599
5691933,5,B00C6QXFIU,"While I can understand and relate to many reviewers stating that this is ""Nothing New"" or that it's all ""light-talking with an episode stuck on the end"", there needs to be a very relevant point made about this product, DOCTOR WHO: THE DOCTORS REVISITED is NOT for long-time Doctor Who fans. It's not made for me (35 years of viewing) or any of you who have stuck around for similar timeframes. This is for people who have either (a) heard of but never seen Doctor Who, (b) seen modern Who but know nothing about classic Who, or (c) for people who have never heard nor seen of this show in the last 50 years. It doesn't offer anything new for those of us that have been with the show, because it's not supposed to. It's designed to introduce Doctor Who's history to the modern audience. And for that, it performs admirably.

I pre-purchased this after having seen a couple of the BBCAmerica episodes. The plan is to send it to a dear friend who loves modern Who, but has seen absolutely ZERO of the Classic era. Instead of having to wade in hip-deep on Netlflix or pay $40+ to try out a Classic ep, this allows the new viewer to get a grip on Classic Who and its many eras and details via friendly modern faces (Steven Moffat, David Tennant, etc.)

Fanboys and Fangirls, this isn't for you! :) This is for your friend that asks the 50-year-old question that brings a smile to your face: ""Doctor......who??""

Get it for them. It will be a great Stocking Stuffer for the Whovians you love. :)",1373500800,81,1489,4.427007299270073
5691934,1,B00C6QXFIU,"The Doctors Revisited may be a good idea on paper, but out on DVD is not a good idea, especially since three of the four stories presented here are already out in Special Editions. I think they could have done a better job of selecting First, Second and Third Doctor stories to present here, especially with the First Doctor, since An Uneartly Child woud have been a better choice, not only because it was the first Doctor Who story and would have been a good way to introduce the series to a new viewer, The Aztecs just came out as a Special Edition and An Unearthly Child is not out in a Special Edition. I would also have liked to see The Dominators as the Second Doctor Story and The Curse Of Peladon as the Third Doctor story.",1371859200,,731,4.304347826086956
5691935,5,B00C6QXFIU,"After reading the other reviews and having viewed the specials myself on BBC America, I'd say this is an excellent way to introduce a new generation of Who fans to the Doctor. Aspect ratio or not, you'll still get to see some classic episodes without spending a fortune.",1370131200,3,270,4.645833333333333
5691936,3,B00C6QXFIU,"As with another writer, I already have these programs as they were originally released to DVD. I've been watching the anniversary programs on BBC America. I might be interested in getting a collection of the introductions without the episodes on DVD, but I'm not interested in re-buying programs I already have. (I'll just keep them stored on my DVR until I get bored. :-)",1369785600,4,372,4.828125
5691937,3,B00C6QXFIU,"I have been watching the revisitations as they have aired on BBC America and have to say that I found the initial Doctor profiles quite entertaining. However, I was quite disappointed with the way the serials that were shown with those profiles, were presented. What they did was take the original 4:3 aspect ratio and squish it down to a 1.78:1. What they didn't do was crop the top or bottom to maintain the proper perspective - they just squished the image so that now, everything looks shorter and fatter. Hopefully this will be corrected on the dvds and the stories will be returned to their proper ratios. Unfortunately, the discription given on Amazon states that it is still in the 1.78:1 ratio.

The 5th Doctor's revisitation just aired this evening, and after the Doctor's profile ended, and the squished version of 'Earthshock' started - I slipped in my DVD of the same story so I could watch it in the correct ratio. I just can't stand watching something in the wrong aspect ratio.

If you are a die hard fan, and must have the profiles for your collection - go for it. Otherwise I would wait until the product is released to find out whether or not the stories are presented in the correct ratio. If they are then I would say that this would make a fantastic additon to your Doctor Who collection, or make an excellant purchase/gift for any fan of the new series, who would like an introduction to the classic series - $34 (as of today) is quite a good bang for the buck. If you were to buy all of these stoies seperately it would cost just over $70 at the prices listed at this time - of course with Amazon this may change.",1369612800,21,1637,4.453333333333333
5691938,3,B00C6QXFIU,"Dr No would be more appropriate for this menagerie of kudos from Steven Moffat and David Tennant. Don't get me wrong, I love listening to Tennant and his admiration for his fore-bearers, but this series would have been better served to have old interviews with the original Doctors 1,2 and 3. At least we got to hear from Tom Baker, but again, not enough. Clearly it is all about fawning all over the mythos of the series by present company. I would also like to have Matt in on the discussion too.
 Then to make matters worse, they used a copy of The Aztecs that was completely unwatchable. The Tomb of the Cybermen had the awful hum that seems to accompany many of the earlier episodes. (some of course due to the soundtrack as a result of a fan made recording from their TV set). Also a lame choice for Tom Baker's episode was shown. Genesis of the Daleks would have been insurmountable.
 If this kind of celebration continues, the 50th anniversary will fade into the past as those that were never officially celebrated by television specials at all.",1367452800,10,1053,4.5661375661375665
5691939,4,B00C6QXFIU,"2013 is the 50th Anniversary of ""Doctor Who"". In this 4-disc DVD set, each Doctor has a celebratory documentary/Special looking back on his tenure.  There are interviews, photos and clips from various series. Each special is followed by a favorite series for that Doctor, including a special introduction by Steven Moffat (current Dr. Who Showrunner and Lead Writer).

Fans like me, who have been purchasing each series as it comes out on DVD, will probably not need to buy this DVD set. (Though I did watch all the specials on TV.) But if you are wondering just what all the excitement is about, this will be a good introduction to the first four of the Classic Doctor Who's.

1st DOCTOR - WILLIAM HARTNELL (1963-1966)
Commentators: Steven Moffat, David Tennant (10th doctor), Neil Gaiman (writer, wrote ""The Doctor's Wife"" series), William Russell (plays Ian, one of the first companions), Caroline Skinner (executive producer), Peter Purves (plays Steve Taylor, in Hartnell's 2nd group of companions) and John Barrowman (plays Captain Jack Harkness in ""Dr. Who"" and ""Torchwood"").

The Daleks are the 1st aliens Doctor Who encounters. It isn't until their 2nd appearance, however, that they invade Earth, and the Doctor goes proactive in protecting Earth. Tennant points out: The Daleks ""became almost bigger than the show that spawned them. ... Brilliant design [on a] ridiculously small budget.""

But the series picked to showcase the first Doctor has no alien opponent. It is one of the historical series, where Doctor Who visits different time periods on Earth. The special is followed by the series, ""The Aztecs"" (1964), four episodes of 25 minutes each:
The TARDIS lands in the tomb of an Aztec priest. On her own, Barbara goes through a door, which closes behind her. An angry priest cries, ""Woman! ... You trespass and must be punished!""  Fortunately, Barbara is wearing a snake bracelet taken from the tomb. What do you know? Believing the tomb to be permanently sealed, the only way she could have gotten the bracelet is if she is the god Yetaxa, returned to her people.

When Yetaxa is to preside over a human sacrifice, Barbara determines to use her position to halt this Aztec practice. The Doctor is angry, but cannot convince her to leave history as it is.

Nothing works out the way Barbara expects. Even the man who was to be sacrificed is not grateful. ""You have denied me honor,"" he tells her, before flinging himself off the top of the temple to his death. So if the first theme of the serial is SHOULD we change history?, the second theme is CAN we change history? In addition, they've made an enemy out of a priest, and he determines to get rid of them all, god or no.

2nd DOCTOR  -  PATRICK TROUGHTON (1966-1969)
Commentators include Steven Moffat, David Tennant, Wendy Padbury (plays companion Zoe Heriot), Neil Gaiman, Frazer Hines (plays companion Jamie McCrimmon), John Barrowman and Caroline Skinner.
Moffat says that when Matt Smith was trying to figure out his Doctor, Patrick Troughton is the version he fell in love with.

This special is followed by the series ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" (1967), four episodes of 25 minutes each:
A group of archeologists set to blow the face off a cliff. The leader says, ""According to the map reference, that should be the entrance to the City of Telos""; the planet and city of Telos, home of the supposedly extinct Cybermen.

Everybody cheers when giant doors are revealed, framed by the images of Cybermen. But the first man to try to open the doors is electrocuted. That's when the Doctor, Jamie, and Victoria arrive. The Doctor deactivates the doors, and everyone troops in, the Doctor fretting about additional booby-traps. But there's not just possible Cyberman traps to worry about. Someone on the expedition is ready to kill people, too. To what purpose, though?

The sequences with the five-story Cyberman tomb are outstanding. This is an example of how black & white can be effective, evocative and chilling. The long shot of awakened Cybermen climbing down the ladders on each side, drums and horns banging in the background, is fantastic.

3rd DOCTOR  -  JON PERTWEE (1970-1974)
Commentators include David Tennant, Steven Moffat, Caroline Skinner, Camille Coduri (plays Jacki Tyler, Rose's Mom), Hugh Bonneville (plays Captain Avery, and the Earl of Grantham on Downton Abbey), Adam Garcia (plays Alex Klein), Richard Franklin (plays UNIT Captain Mike Yates) and John Barrowman.
Bonneville grins as he says, ""You could almost touch the velvet that he was wearing. And the ruched shirt. It was Tom Jones in drama. It was extraordinary.""

Pertwee's Doctor was such a change from Troughton, and not only because he was nattily dressed. He also was different because of his physicality. As the narrator says, ""This was the only Doctor who saved the world with fast cars and fist fights.""

Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart becomes a recurring character. I've never thought of him as an authoritarian military type, perhaps because I did not ""discover"" Doctor Who until I was an adult. Moffat capsulizes my feelings well, ""In lesser hands than Nicholas Courtney's, the Brigadier would have been such a boring character - he really is a sort of military blimp. Instead, [they] cast a man who cannot play a line without twinkling.""

This special is followed by the series ""Spearhead From Space"" (1970), four 25-minute episodes:
The Doctor has just regenerated and isn't well. He's captured by U.N.I.T. and taken to the hospital. Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart has more than Doctor Who on his mind, though. Especially since he doesn't recognize the Doctor, given his new appearance.

Earth is being bombarded by strange meteorites, and an ex-employee of a plastics manufacturer claims that he's seen a walking mannequin. Aha! These two things are related, and it takes the recovered Doctor to figure it out.

This is the first time in Dr. Who history that it is revealed that Time Lords have two hearts and blood incompatible with humans. It is also the first Doctor Who that was totally produced in color! Mannequins coming to life, bursting through department store windows to attack hapless shoppers - great stuff!

4th DOCTOR  -  TOM BAKER (1974-1981)
Commentators include Tom Baker (the 4th Doctor), David Tennant, Steven Moffat, Marcus Wilson (producer), Louise Jameson (plays Leela), Nicholas Briggs (voice of the Daleks), Neil Gaiman and John Leeson (voice of K9).

David Tennant: ""I think the casting of Tom Baker was one of those moments when the absolute right fit for something is found.""

Tom Baker is only saying what many fans believe when he says, ""When I became Doctor Who, I didn't play Doctor Who, I WAS Doctor Who..... There was no acting involved at all.""

The famous scarf? Baker says, ""The scarf was a happy accident. Jim brought a truck load of wool and sent it down to a woman, called Begonia Pope. She just used up all the wool! She just kept knitting!""

This special is followed by the series ""Pyramids of Mars"" (1975), four 25-minute episodes:
The Doctor is bored and Sarah Jane cannot cheer him up. Then, the TARDIS gives a huge jolt and they're pulled off course. They land in 1911, in a Victorian mansion's room full of Egyptian coffins. The Doctor says, ""Something's going contrary to the rules of the universe."" This cheers him up no end and they go exploring.

How are mummies walking? What is the organ music summoning?  Why does Laurence's Marconiscope go wild when it's pointed at Mars? And just who is Sutekh the Destroyer? I'll give you a hint of the plot: Once again, the Doctor must save the world.

NOTE: In promotional blurbs, the documentaries of each Doctor are described as being 40 minutes each. When I've timed them on my cable's OnDemand, though, they've been of varying shorter lengths. Give or take a minute, the Specials for the four Doctors in this set, including commercials and Moffat's special introduction, range from 32 to 36 minutes each.

This collection is the first four doctors. I started with Doctor 4 played by  Tom Baker. Thank god to PBS, they ran some of the Doctors William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee. So I saw many of these episodes in movie format. FYI-you should try to find the episode The Three Doctors which has Hartnell (his last DR WHO Appearance),, Troughton and Pertwee together. If you really want a treat try the Five Doctor's DVD special edition.

The unique thing about this collection is the choice the viewer has in regards to watching these episodes. You have a choice of  movie format (98 minute movie) or original four episodes. Foe the Doctor fan is is a nice keepsake, Never the less it is just the episodes.

 The one problem I miss is on the original DVD of these episodes there are audio commentary,  interviews and other extras. This package has none of the single DVD goodies. You also have a mini documentary like it ran on BBC America of the Doctor Revisited. A 30 minutes film  explaining the different  doctor and his companions

Is it worth getting? For the low price and having an episode of each of the four doctors,, it is! For me, I like the extras, so this set as good as it is, isn't what I would buy. Nevertheless, it is worth the price

5691962,5,B00C6QXFIU,"I loved this DVD set. You've got 25-minute documentaries on each Doctor (#1, 2, 3 & 4), an introduction by Steven Moffatt at the beginning of each adventure, and each story has a feature-length version included with this set as well as the original 4-part versions.

First you have ""The Aztecs"" with Doctor #1 William Hartnell. Although ""The Aztecs"" wasn't one of Hartnell's better stories, I still found it enjoyable to say the least. It's also one of the few historical stories that still exists, and it explores the idea of altering history for the first time in the show. Ian's final battle with Ixta was exciting and very well shot and edited, and it does have some great drama in it. I love Barbara's character in this one; the dilemmas she faced in this story were quite moving. I just wished they had a little bit more action in this one. Four stars

Next is the classic ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" with Doctor #2 Patrick Troughton. Certainly one of the best second Doctor stories which was quite eerie and thrilling. The sets are spectacular, the Cybermen are very creepy, the lighting is moody as well as the incidental music, it's action-packed with some great acting. Five stars

Then we have ""Spearhead from Space"" with Doctor #3 Jon Pertwee. The first television Doctor Who to be made in color, this eerie and action-packed story is written by the great Robert Holmes and introduces the Autons for the first time. Five stars

Last we have ""Pyramids of Mars"" with the great Doctor #4 Tom Baker. Although Tom's Doctor isn't as humorous in this one as he is in a lot of his other stories, this is a great story with lots of suspense, an all-star cast, great visuals, and some good eerie moments in it. This is kind of a dark story which is probably why Tom's more serious in this one, but Tom Baker's acting is superb as always, and he does find a scene here and there where he adds some nice humor into the piece. Co-written by Robert Holmes, I think any Whovian can enjoy this one. Five stars

Highly Recommended!",1382918400,,2021,4.556473829201102
5691963,3,B00C6QXFIU,"The stories are familiar territory now so 'nuff sed.
I also noticed the aspect ratio issue but, all the same, it's a very good way to see the Doctor evolve, just as the Doctor evolved.
Stephen Moffat is really not in the same league as Russell T. Davies and it does irk me that I can't see the name of the show without getting a whiff of his somewhere. Still, the commentaries are interesting enough and the fridge magnets are a nice bonus.
This really is for the completist; there's nothing really new here. I'd give it as a Christmas present for someone relatively new to the show.
I wonder if anybody else noticed...During the horrendous end credits of Pyramids of Mars, Philip Hinchcliffe's name is mis-spelled. It reads ""HINCHECLIFFE."" You would think that, for the amount of times his name has been on the credits, the BBC would get it right for this, an erstwhile 50th anniversary celebration. Disgraceful.",1382572800,,913,4.7125

5691972,4,B00C6QXFIU,"This four-disk set goes through the first four actors who played The Doctor with a half-hour documentary on each and then one representative episode from each. Very interesting stuff as I hadn't realized how much the show has evolved over the years. The first doctor, William Hartnell, wasn't especially likeable or ""nice"" and I'm surprised the show survived him. His first companions were his granddaughter (they have yet to explain that family tree) and a pair of school teachers he basically kidnapped. The male teacher ended up being the action hero of the piece and the Doctor was just this doddering old weirdo kind of off to the side. The second Doctor, Patrick Troughton, was where he really became the center of his own show and it started to hit its stride. I had seen some shows featuring third Doctor Jon Pertwee but didn't realize that the setup for his years was very different than for any of the other Doctors. His backstory is that the Time Lords bascially stranded him on earth and forced him to work as scientific advisor to UNIT. So for his shows, all the monsters and villains basically come to him (or to earth) instead of him running around the cosmos and falling into adventures, as he did before and since. For his shows, he used a whole series of earth vehicles like cars and helicopters and even carried a gun some of the time. My starting point for the series was Fourth Doctor Tom Baker, who is interviewed here and is still among my favorites because he's so British, at times manic, and usually very alien. The episode they use for Baker's years was The Pyramids of Mars, which is one of the first I ever saw. Like James Bond (who also has the 50th anniversary of his series coming up soon), this character has been played by many actors, but unlike the British spy, the Doctor's personality changes almost completely with each actor. After this, I'm looking forward to the set for Doctors 5-8!",1375315200,4,1925,4.648093841642229

5691974,5,B00C6QXFIU,"Many of the reviews currently shown for this product are complaints about what is NOT on this set, criticisms of the stories selected for each Doctor, and general criticism about the nature of the specials themselves stating that they aren't the be all/end all documentary for each Doctor. I wanted to write a review of what the set actually is, not what it isn't.

There are hours and hours of documentaries on the older Warner Brothers/2 Entertain DVDs that we die-hard Whovians have been buying for well over a decade. For at least the last five years, almost every story released on DVD has been given a lengthy making-of documentary and a retrospective feature with all the surviving cast and/or crew. This product is of its time, meaning that it's a look back on 50 years of Doctor Who by the people who are currently involved in the future of the show. It's designed for new fans to get a taste of what has come before and give them a jumping-off point for which to pursue each previous Doctor. This is not for the people who bought a DVD of The Five Doctors in 2001, it's for people who have never heard of The Five Doctors so that they can get a taste of Doctor Who outside of Matt Smith.

And I like the choices of episodes shown here. Pyramids of Mars, for instance, was the Tom Baker story that hooked me on his Doctor decades ago when I first saw it. There are certainly more important stories out there starring Tom Baker's Doctor, but it's a fine story that comes from the most well regarded period, being producer Philip Hinchliffe's tenure. It's eerie and gothic, but filled with the science fiction elements that are a hallmark of the series. And I imagine the reason they aren't showing the cleaned up versions of these episodes is because they want to offer incentive for fans to buy the actual, proper DVD releases (filled with extras) of the stories. With the re-release program, stories that originally had sparse extras are now being reissued with lavish features. That's both a good and a bad thing for those of us who bought the DVDs the first time around, but it's definitely a good thing for newer Whovians building a DVD library.

In my family, these specials have been a hit. I've been a devoted Doctor Who fan for about 20 years and have scores of the DVDs on the shelf. My wife and daughter, however, don't have the die-hard interest I do in the series and didn't really start watching with me until David Tennant. These specials are revelatory for them in showing what made those earlier Doctors so beloved. It's a great starting point for those looking for an entry point in the daunting 50 year history of Doctor Who. At the current Amazon price of less than 33 dollars for 4 classic stories and a couple of hours of retrospectives, it seems value-priced for all levels of fans to add to their shelf.

In the end, are these the documentaries I would have produced for each of these Doctors? No, they aren't. My documentaries would be hours and hours in length, but when I watched them I would probably quickly discover myself alone in an empty room because that wouldn't be accessible for a general audience. This feels like a great introduction for current/new Doctor Who fans (I hear so many people who say they love Doctor Who but have only watched Matt Smith) that doesn't insult older fans. Every new fan has to start somewhere in their quest to discover the past incarnations of our favorite Time Lord, and this seems like a better place than most.",1375142400,32,3489,4.568690095846645
5691975,5,B00C6QXFIU,"Great DVD showcasing 1 story from each Doctor 1-4. Also includes special features about each Doctor, as seen on BBCA",1375142400,,116,4.85
5691976,1,B00C6QXFIU,"I've been watching Dr Who since time immemorial (well, since 1963, the BBC was in a fairly embryonic state in 1189) and I found the Revisited specials to be very entertaining, both from a ""where are they now"" perspective and to hear how some of the creators of the current show were influenced by having grown up with Dr Who.

The presentation of the episodes leaves a lot to be desired however. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, the aspect ratio is wrong, very wrong.

When broadcast on BBCA they were converted into stretchyvision to fill a 16:9 display. The pixel aspect ratio in the middle of the image is correct, but gets progressively wider towards the edges of the image. The theory is that your attention is on the centre of the image and you won't notice the distortion at the edges as much. The practical result is quite disconcerting, especially on larger displays. And you cannot correct for it with aspect ratio controls on your display or player.

If you buy this set to get the episodes they selected, you will likely be disappointed. Otherwise it is an entertaining, but expensive, set of retrospectives.",1374796800,9,1123,4.719387755102041

The box has a small yellow sticker on it that says ""Includes Set of 4 Collectible Doctor Who Fridge Magnets"" on it and when I opened up the case, sure enough there were 4 magnets on one magnetic sheet that have images of all 4 of the doctors in the set along with some villains they battled in the series.

5691979,4,B00C6QXFIU,"1st Doctor: The Aztecs
2nd Doctor: The Tomb of the Cybermen
3rd Doctor: Spearhead from Space
4th Doctor: Pyramids of Mars

This set is a good 'starter kit' for fans that have not seen the classic Doctor Who series. If you have been buying the single releases of the Doctor Who DVD's, this is more of the same. There are no 'behind the scenes' features, but they do have the interviews with some of the new show's cast and crew that aired on BBC America. Also, each of the 4 stories are presented as the way they were originally aired (broken into parts) and also in the form of one long story (opening and closing credits edited out).

The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is due to the fact, if you already have these four stories as individual releases, you are not really gaining much other than the short interviews from their BBC America airing, with David Tennant and Steven Moffat being the main people in the chair. However, Disc 4, 'Pyramids of Mars' does have a few moments with Tom Baker in the interview chair. But again, if you watched it on BBC America you know what to expect.

8577776,3,B00C6QXFIU,"Dr. Who: The Doctors Revisited Part 1 [DVD]

This 4-disc set samples what Dr. Who looked like with the first 4 actors playing the Doctor.  Each disc contains a discussion of one actor and the situation of the show at the time, followed by one story with that actor.  The story is displayed twice [which seems to me like an effort just to fill 4 discs and charge customers more]: first as a continuous viewing about 90 minutes long, and then in the original serialized format [generally 4 episodes].  We have William Hartnell in The Aztecs, Patrick Troughton in Tomb of the Cybermen, Jon Pertwee in Spearhead from Space and Tom Baker in Pyramids of Mars.

Actually I skimmed the first two since they are in black & white, monaural, somewhat grainy and I thought Id seen enough of that already.  With Jon Pertwee, the show changed almost completely.  First, this was the first season to run in color.  Second: in that season the Doctor is confined to contemporary earth, helping out the agency UNIT in combatting hostile extra-terrestrials.  Third: since he isn't traveling, a lead-travel-companion isn't as important.  Fourth: a different personality for the Doctor-usually the case, with a change of actor.

Pertwee makes full use of the innovation of color, dressing in impressive regalia and driving bright motorcars.  His is a serious and aristocratic doctor, judging from this 4-part story.  I really appreciated Spearhead From Space very much.  Despite low-budget props, it seemed at least as good as many sci-fi movies of that era.  The baddies here are Autons, which were reprised in the first season of modern Dr. Who as store mannequins that come to life and try to take over the world.  Here a full four episodes tell the tale and it never lags.  It has a strong basic similarity to Invasion of the Body Snatchers and it is much more chilling than the modern tale, since the higher-grade Autons exactly imitate the appearance, speech and habitus of humans they are replacing.  Pertwees Doctor also borrows a page from another British icon, James Bond, as he tries at times to be a sort of action-hero, engaging in physical struggles with baddies, though not very convincingly.

The fourth doctor is Tom Baker.  In the commentary, hes described as being funny and zany.  Sad to say, this was not in evidence in the story Pyramids of Mars.  In the first one or two episodes he doesnt even have that much screen time.  This is a really cheesy Mummy story crossed with Invasion From Mars.  The acting, the script, the plot, the sound, the props were all so lame that I became bored and simply unable to continue to the second half.  Baker looks like a sort of hybrid of Straw-Man from Wizard of Oz crossed with Arlo Guthrie and Donovan.  Im sure he had potential, but this episode didn't showcase it.  His Doctor was a contrast to his predecessor in that he never engaged in physical conflict himself, preferring to resolve conflicts with his intelligence.  Baker is, thus far, the longest-serving actor in the Doctor role.  He also has perhaps the longest-lasting companion in Sarah Jane Smith [Elizabeth Slayden] and his era introduced the beloved K-9 robot-dog companion.  In those years Star Wars was popular, including the robots R2-D2 and C3PO; Dr. Who jumped on this trend with the hyper-intelligent and loyal K-9 robot.  In summary: Out of 4 story lines with 4 Doctors, I found ""Spearhead from Space"" to be quite compelling.  The script was clearly a high quality drama and this is a good indication of why this show stayed popular.  On the other hand, Pyramids of Mars is a good illustration of how the show suffered at times.  That whole script having been re-written before production probably contributed to the overall lackluster performance in the story.  Nice slice of the first 4 doctors' performance.",1459641600,5,3823,4.8382126348228045
