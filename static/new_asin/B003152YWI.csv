4048060,1,B003152YWI,"I rented this movie because I enjoy the acting of Paul Giamatti. I read the reviews and the phrases ""Flat out funny"" and ""You'll laugh till it hurts"" caught my eye.  I couldn't make it past 48 minutes of this god awful and boring movie. In those first 48 minutes I think might have mildly chuckled for a split second. Peter Travers must have smoked some bad crack before he watched this.  The plot is slow moving and convoluted. I didn't make it to the end so I cannot comment on that. Trust me on this....THIS MOVIE WILL NOT MAKE YOU LAUGH!  You've been warned!",1268438400,6,562,4.333333333333333

'Cold Souls' is another film that defies easy classification. I think it's best to think of it as more of a combination of fantasy and satire than science fiction, since it doesn't take itself at all very seriously. It seems to be set in present day New York, but it could be a few years in the future. Paul Giamatti plays a depressed version of himself who feels he's lost his creative abilities as an actor. While rehearsing the part of Uncle Vanya in the famed Chekov play, he finds he simply cannot bring the character to life.

While flipping through The New Yorker magazine, he sees an ad for an outfit that specializes in 'Soul Storage' located (in of all places), Roosevelt Island! He makes an appointment and goes to the see the director of the company, Dr. Flintstein (David Strathaim). Flintstein explains that what his company does is extract souls from peoples' bodies and stores them for a fee. The actual extraction does not affect the consciousness of the person and they retain all their memories. Flinstein further explains to Giamatti that 5% of the soul usually survives the extraction procedure but without the other 95%, supposedly the personality will become 'lighter' and less unencumbered since most of the soul is no longer there to weigh the person down.

Giamatti agrees to the procedure and enters a contraption that looks like a modern day 'iron lung'. The actual soul resembles a chickpea and is stored in a container which is then placed in locked drawers inside a room that resembles a bank vault. The company also specializes in renting out other peoples' souls which are smuggled in by black market mules from Russia. When Giamatti's soul is first extracted, he feels the initial procedure doesn't help him with his acting skills so he rents the soul of an anonymous Russian poet which he hopes will make him more proficient in playing Uncle Vanya.

While Giamatti's wife perceives him to be a different person, there is no outwardly discernible change in his personality. Even though Giamatti's body is inhabited by the soul of a poet, we the audience cannot perceive the change. Thus the potential for any kind of interesting plot twists or satire is lost.

The plot takes a turn when the head of the black market soul extraction operation in Russia orders one of the mules, Nina (Nina Korzun), to steal the soul of a famous American actor for his wife, who wants to improve her acting skills in soap operas. The joke is that the only 'famous actor' they have on file is Giamatti, so Nina steals his soul and it's placed in the actress's body. Giamatti discovers that his soul is missing from the vault and eventually learns from Nina that it's the Russians who have pilfered it. The climax takes place mainly in Russia where Giamatti aided by Nina kidnap the actress and manage to retrieve the missing soul. Along the way, Giamatti discovers the identity of the Russian poet inside his body and it turns out she's committed suicide. The final scene has Giamatti meeting a woman at a beach--is it Nina or the dead poet? Whatever the case, the shot fades to a blur and the two figures seem to merge into one.

The problem with Giamatti's attempt to make fun of himself is that it goes on ad infinitum. We GET the idea from the very beginning that he's supposed to be mediocre and narcissistic and half way through the movie, the mugging becomes tiresome. The same goes for the Russians--again the point is played out over and over again that they're a bunch of seedy, amoral characters who are just out to make a buck. The only really enjoyable character is the personable Dr. Flintstein-- David Strathaim does a fine job in conveying the humor of a man who treats the extraction and storage of souls as if he were selling life insurance.

'Cold Souls' is often slow-paced, due to the repetitious scenes that feature the various characters undergoing the extraction process. Toward the film's climax, Giamatti puts on special goggle glasses and ""peers into his soul""--there are a few tame flashbacks of his childhood, but nothing very memorable.

In the end, 'Cold Souls' has no real targets of value to satirize. The whole idea of 'soul extraction' is also too ludicrous for fantasy which requires some grounding in reality (an actual 'twister' carried Dorothy to the fantasy land of Oz; here, they're extracting souls that look like chickpeas). Some may still find 'Cold Souls' charming in an odd way but if you really look at it, this is a film based on a one-note, one-joke idea.",1267228800,7,4561,4.73551637279597
4048062,4,B003152YWI,"Like the previous reviewer, I wonder why Amazon has this slated for a March release?  I've watched it three times already, having rented it from a video outlet.

In any event, anyone who admires the precision and intensely sharp work of Paul Giamatti should find this a great primer on acting. As the film shows, when ""actor Paul Giamatti"" suffers from the burdensome weight of rehearsing Chekhov's *Uncle Vanya* he enlists the services of an entrepreneurial operation which puts souls in cold storage.  The result of a ""soulless actor"" is hilarious (though in interviews Giamatti swears he's not channeling William Shatner's much-parodied histrionics).

As always, Giamatti's performance is Academy Award material, casting nuances and fascinating acting choices at every turn. Ably coupled with Emily Watson and a fine supporting cast, this film, in my mind, suffers only in a couple areas--much of the film is visually dark, heavily shadowed on the DVD, and people who approach it thinking (rightfully so) that it's a bang-up comedy might find it slow going.

But I would submit the pacing is just right for this material: Soul extraction is not just played for laughs, though there are many to be enjoyed [The film is a scathing satire of the free market gone horribly wrong; see the novel *Jennifer Government* by Maxx Barry for a more free-wheeling examination of this idea]. This is a poignant Ecce-Homo-meets-Memento-Mori film whose ending begs for discussion.

Knowing it was partially filmed in Russia heightened my enjoyment of the film and added an extra dimension to the drab existential ""aloneness"" that one of the key players exhibited.  And knowing Boris Leskin knows no English added powerful verisimilitude to the production.  Though the film (again, quite rightly) is being compared to Charlie Kaufman's work, for me *Cold Souls* offered much more heart and hope than any of CK's work, which usually leaves me entertained but cold-souled.

Despite its rather measured pacing, somewhat dark transfer, and the soul extractor's appearance (to me) as an oversized roll of Cottonelle, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone who wants to think a bit while enjoying a few great performances.",1266710400,5,2221,5.181564245810056
4048063,5,B003152YWI,"(Just watched this on Netflix, where it came out on 2/2/10.  Why is it not yet available on Amazon?  I think it says something when you give a DVD a Netflix-level commitment, then you immediately want to add it to your collection because it warrants repeated viewing.)

An actor named Paul Giamatti struggles with his performance as Uncle Vanya in a production of Checkov's play.  As a possible cure to his internal struggles, his character ends up at a company specializing in the extraction and storage of a person's soul.

I won't say any more about the plot; there is a certain joy of discovery in ""Cold Souls.""  Elements borrow from ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Being John Malkovich;"" the film had a very Charlie Kaufman feel to it, but slightly more serious in tone and subtle in its humor.  Also, as a fan of Mr. Giamatti's work, it was interesting to see allusions to his other films (the white room sequence recalled something similar in ""Amercian Splendor"").

In terms of the DVD, there are few extra features.  Deleted scenes, a 5-minute short on the fabrication of the Soul Extractor, and trailers for other films.  The absence of a commentary is a disappointment.  I'm hoping that a Blu-Ray version includes more, and possibly I was watching an inferior ""Netflix-only"" version of the DVD.",1265241600,12,1317,4.808888888888889
4048064,5,B003152YWI,"Very good. Although I think labeling this as a comedy is a little misleading. That's not to say it doesn't have funny parts. It's just more than that. It's sorta kinda in the realm of a Charlie Kaufman/Spike Jonez kinda feel without being derivative.

Great acting. Interesting and original story. It also has a beautiful/melancholy look to it. Same goes for the music.

4048067,1,B003152YWI,"It is possible that Paul Giamatti is a good guy.  I know nothing of his personal life and do not think I have ever seen him interviewed.  He could, however, be the worst actor of all time.  He is definitely the most overrated.  Everything about him is just irritating - his looks, his mannerisms, his nasally voice.  Assuming he has some acting talent, I am surprised anyone was able to stomach him long enough to notice.

It is a mystery why he keeps landing roles.  He has been in a number of films I would have enjoyed, but for him.  His portrayal of Dr. Landy in ""Love & Mercy"" was particularly egregious.",1503014400,,609,4.375

4048084,4,B003152YWI,"Here's a movie that is a good bit warmer than its title suggests.  It's a comedy that, like some of Shakespeare's, has an outlandish premise -- that the human soul can be extracted, stored, re-inserted, or inserted in another person!  That sounds ridiculous, but if you can swallow Puck and the Forest of Arden, you'll have no trouble with this.  Paul Giamatti plays an actor of the same name who feels his soul growing heavy as he struggles in rehearsals for an ""Uncle Vanya"" production, and, on reading an article in the ""New Yorker"" about soul extraction, he decides to try it.  The scenes in the doctor's office, with David Strathairn smooth and deadpan as Dr. Flintztein, are quite marvelous, but it turns out there are complications -- there's a market in souls, especially in Russia, although the trade goes both ways, using ""mules"" who temporarily carry souls across borders to have them extracted on the other side.  The lovely and rather melancholy Nina (Dina Korzun) is a mule who gets involved with Paul's efforts to find his own soul after it has been sent to Russia to an aspiring actress who is led to believe that it is Al Pacino's!

All that sounds (and is) ridiculous, and there's obviously a lot of humor in the movie, but there's an undertone of sadness too.  To want another soul is to be unhappy as oneself, and Paul finds that to have a different soul -- he tries out that of a Russian woman poet for a couple of weeks -- doesn't make as much difference to his happiness as he had thought.  Of course, he doesn't fully realize that the borrowed soul is from a person just as unhappy and even more desperate than he is.  Then there's the idea that Nina is wearing her own soul out by doing all the transportation of other souls.  The question of what makes a person a person, philosophically considered, isn't on the table here.  Rather, it's the more mundane preoccupation with one's consciousness of oneself as less satisfied than one could be.  Does Paul get his soul back? you'll have to see the movie to find out.  What happens to the Russian poet whose soul Paul ""borrows""?  And what part do others play -- our spouses, friends, fellow-workers -- in making our souls and contributing to our joys and sorrows?  The movie is only around 100 minutes, and Paul Giamatti is -- well, soulful throughout.  The whole cast is expert, although Emily Watson, as Paul's wife Claire, isn't given much to do.",1479081600,,2422,4.610722610722611
4048085,5,B003152YWI,"Let start by typing that this film is flawed. It is wonderfully flawed. It takes a chance.  It reaches out into the dark.  It feels as though it may have been a short story in a previous life. There are segments of the plot that can be confusing. These aren't anchors to the work's merit. This film is a candle to the bonfire of imagination.  I find no flaw with the performances of any of the actors. Paul Giamatti delivered a strong, existential portrayal of himself. I am especially impressed by the work of Dina Korzun. She beautifully expressed a character (who is technically without a soul) with convincing detail. If you are looking for something different, this could very well be what you are seeking. The film embodies the ""goggles."" It opens one up to introspection.",1477008000,,778,4.664233576642336

It's hard to classify this film: comedy? drama? science-fiction? all of the above? Paul Giamatti stars himself as an actor who is having emotional problems in portraying a character in ""Uncle Vanya,"" although it's right on target. His agent suggests going through a procedure which has become commonplace, that of removing his soul (which then takes physical shape) and having it temporarily stored. Well, the pain, the angst, the existential whachamacallit is gone, but he is not the same person anymore and his performance actually gets worse. So he wants it back. In the meantime, his life is intersected by a Russian woman who is a ""mule"" for smuggling Russian souls for rent/sale into the US (why they are in demand is left unexplained).

The Russian mule winds up stealing Paul's locked away soul and implanting it in a Russian soap-opera actress. By this time, Paul has realized that he cannot be himself without his soul and the search ensues.

There are plenty of laughs. There are a few dark moments, and I was disappointed that the soul of ""Olga"" is never detailed more thoroughly. It was an entertaining film.

This little gem is low-key humor, but very funny indeed, with Paul Giamatti playing himself, as a depressed actor who decides to have his soul extracted.  Unfortunately, his soul is ""lost"" somewhere in Russia, and the hilarity begins. The movie arrived in perfect, sealed condition as described, brand new, shipped very fast!  Highly recommend this little gem of a movie and this great seller as well!",1273968000,,437,5.126760563380282
4048133,3,B003152YWI,"This movie was marketed at a comedy of sorts, but it is actually quite plodding and dour. Paul Giamatti plays a beleaguered NYC theater actor (named Paul Giamatti) who is having a hard time dealing with the psychological anxiety of playing the lead in Checkhov's seminal Uncle Vanya, so he enlists the help of a team of Soul-storers led by the excellent (yet dry) David Stratham. They remove his soul under the guise of making his life better, and for a while, it seems to work. Gradually, he realizes tht soullessness is no fun, as a soul makes you human. (there is also a vague subplot concerning the Russian mob and similarly murky dream sequences involving old greying corpse-like men and small children that play like watered-down David Lynch) The film progresses like a slower version of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, without the love-story angle or exciting visuals...and really, come to think about it, without the interesting characters involved in the whole scheme of muddling with intangibility (Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst equalled out Jim Carrey's sadness in that film, here there is no comic relief...just more mopey, flat characters like the Russian girl)  There is a pretty drab blue, smoky color palate at work here, and a lot of talented character actors doing their cold, straight-man routines. There are a lot of scenes of Giamatti just staring off at things in a faux-existential stupor. This tactic, while it reinforces his soulless ennui, is painfully slow. Occasional humor permeates the cloud of despondence, as when Paul admits to his wife that he has been turned into a empty, staggering vessel, or when (soulless) his Uncle Vanya takes on a brash, kooky aspect. Otherwise the film is morose, yet admirably well-lit. Intriguing internal conflict aside, there is a serious lack of momentum as well as  memorable scenes.",1273449600,4,1885,5.038461538461538
4048134,5,B003152YWI,Sci-fi at its best. Story is creative. Wouldn't mind turning in my soul for a few days (would it look like a chickpea?) and getting it back if it has not been misplaced. Watch out for those hedge fund managers! They are everywhere.,1273104000,,231,4.395348837209302
4048135,5,B003152YWI,"Paul Giamatti has a bit of a problem.  Yeah, that Paul Giamatti, you see While working on a play, he's struggling to get by.  He can't quite figure out what's not right, but his agent thinks he has the answer - store your soul for awhile.  Much like the memory erasing process in Eternal Sunshine, you're not really erasing who you are.  Not totally.  Just getting rid of some extra baggage.  There may be some side effects as every soul is different who knows what those will be?

This is NOT a movie for everyone.  It's not really a comedy, not a drama, not an action flick.  It just sort of is.  The cover of of the DVD does paint it as the kind of comedy that will pretty much have you on the floor rolling.  That's not what this is.  Luckily I had an idea of what it was before I bought it and knew it was my kind of movie.  Instead of what the cover depicts it as, it's actually one of those movies that has you questioning the impossible.  Would you store your soul if the option did exist?  It has you wondering will Paul get his soul back?  At one point  you start to wonder, should he even try to get it back?  Etc.  I don't want to go too far beyond that for fear I'd give  away too much.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's totally my kind of movie.  But be warned you'd really have to like movies like Eternal Sunshine, Being John Malkovich, I heart Huckabees, etc to like this one.  If you want a movie that will have you laughing non stop or that will wrap things up with a nice little Hollywood bow at the end with no questions left unanswered, this isn't the movie for you.",1273017600,2,1590,4.107491856677524
4048136,2,B003152YWI,"I'm a huge fan of Paul Giamatti, so I couldn't resist when I saw a DVD promising a roll-on-the-floor comedic performance.  Sadly, this movie didn't live up to its billing.  Admittedly there were a few parts of the story (mostly toward the beginning) that had us laughing out loud, but they were too few and far between to justify the claims on the label.  The longer the story went on, the less funny it became, and most of the second half barely got a chuckle out of us.

While the premise of the story was novel and certainly held out some promise for a solid comedy, most of the movie was just plain dark, depressing and surreal.  Much of it is set in Russia, which is depressing enough by itself.  The themes are dark.  The suicide of a marginal character is dark.  The use of lighting is, well, dark.  Yes, there are some places where it works and evokes some laughs, but the rest of the movie just doesn't work -- unless you have an extremely dry, somewhat twisted sense of humor.  To his credit, Giamatti's usual stellar performance was the one bright spot.  Not recommended for most viewers.",1272412800,3,1099,4.472361809045226

This is far more subtle and cerebral type humor that tends to show up more in the Independant films rather than anything Hollywood puts out these days. This movie is somewhat broody and sullen without getting to a level of being morose or ascendant. I don't believe many actors could pull this off. Giamatti does a stupendous piece of work in this film!
I knew what to anticipate with this film as I'd previously seen the preview and a review (I think it was ""At the Movies""), and had been looking forward to renting it.
Paul Giamatti is one of those actors that seems to have a voluminous range and I enjoyed the experience.",1271030400,,1152,6.843537414965986
4048138,1,B003152YWI,"I rented this movie ""soul-y"" because I love Paul Giamatti. And because the picture on the cover reminded me of his character in one of my favorite movies - Sideways. But that's where the similarities between these two movies end.

I was disappointed with this movie for many reasons. First, the DVD cover has raves from some movie reviewers claiming how side-splittingly funny this flick is. Huh? I can't remember laughing once, let alone snickering. Ironically, I found the funniest moment in one of the deleted scenes (the one where Giamatti is rehearsing a scene and is told to act it like the wind). This is not a comedy. Not even a black comedy - which I would have welcomed.

Second, though Giamatti's character looks like it was pulled directly from Sideways (complete with the bad brown corduroy blazer), that's where the similarities end. He appeared uncomfortable and self-conscious in his scenes and didn't seem to believe in the premise of the movie or the dialog.

Third, well, the movie is just flat. You immediately are reminded by the premise of Being John Malkovich. But Malkovich somehow made you accept its incredible premise; Cold Souls did not. And if you don't buy into the gimmicky basis of the plot, then you are going to have a tough time taking the rest of the movie seriously.

The movie left me feeling so gypped that I scoured the bonus features for something to enjoy. The deleted scenes were ok but the documentary on the design of the soul removal machine was ridiculous. The guys who designed it went on and on about their artistic influences for its look. Like they just created the Pieta. Wha? The thing looked like the love child of an MRI machine and the Michelin man. There was nothing impressive about its appearance. The designers should start looking for work in a different field.

Very disappointed. But I'll forgive Giamatti this one time...",1270080000,6,1885,4.787692307692308
4048139,3,B003152YWI,"Quirky humor, reminiscent of Being John Malkovich in particular (if you liked that, you will almost certainly like this).  Pacing also reminded me of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Nice camera work, intriguing concept, many thought-provoking questions (e.g., if I have one person's soul and I get another one, where did the first one go?).  I'd rate this film highly indeed if it didn't leave way too many things hanging, including the central plot element (Giamatti's quest to improve his acting by taking a vacation from his soul) and the overall narrative.  Still, a lot of sly and absurdist laughs.  Three stars seems about right.  Definitely worth watching despite the gaping flaws.",1269734400,,696,5.115044247787611
4048140,2,B003152YWI,"The cover told me this was a comedy. Well, after an unpleasant car accident, we thought we could use just that. But this film is all pretense, no content. It aspires to the inspired lunacy of ""Being John Malkovich"", but comes nowhere near it in execution.

While it has several actors I really enjoy, and a great look and feel, it just never caught me. The premise is interesting; the execution feeble. What does it mean to have the soul of another person inside you? What do you lose when you lose your soul? What would happen if you're carrying the soul of another and that person dies? Well, these interesting and, indeed, theologically profound issues, are given an 8th grade term paper treatment, slight, superficial, and silly.

Some movies try to embrace grand themes but can't quite pull it off. ""Nothing"" is a great example. High aspirations, worth watching, but that long drive down the line went foul. ""Cold Souls"" is a weak infield pop-up of big ideas, a film that looks good, sounds good, and has a few fine moments, but is ultimately rather empty.",1269561600,6,1061,4.668449197860962
4048141,2,B003152YWI,"This movie has an outlandish premise in the vein of Being John Malkovich or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: your soul is a physical thing that is extractable, easily removed and returned. In addition, it is sometimes preferable to be without a soul for a while, or to borrow someone else's. It's not the premise that bothered me but the fact that the film did nothing with this concept: neither dark comedy nor insight into whether the soul is the essence of humanity. Some visually beautiful scenes, very good actors, and yet it all seemed flat and...soul-less. This film did make me want to see Uncle Vanya on stage, as I was reminded what a great play it is.",1269129600,13,668,4.575
4048142,4,B003152YWI,"Civilization and its discontents. Paul, an actor preparing for ""Uncle Vanya"" on Broadway, is mired in ennui. His agent tells him about an office where he can put his soul in storage. He does so then discovers that being soulless helps neither his acting nor his marriage; he returns to the office and rents, for two weeks, the soul of a Russian poet. His acting improves, but his wife finds him different, he sees bits of the borrowed soul's life, and he's now deep in sorrow. He wants his own soul back, but there are complications: it's in St. Petersburg. With the help of Nina, a Russian who transports souls to the U.S., he determines to get it back. Despite the heavy subject matter, an abundance of absurdity and wit make ""Cold Souls"" amusing as well as thought-provoking. Though the tone is dark, it is not suffocatingly so Barthes pokes fun at existential torment while seriously grappling with it at the same time. Giamatti is great as the ""actor much like himself"" and Strathairn and Korzun provide excellent support. The writing is solid, though the pacing is a little uneven, I felt the movie begins and wraps up a little too quickly. Overall ""Cold Souls"" is definitely worth watching.",1269129600,5,1197,4.732057416267943

This was slow moving, somewhat confusing, and yet interesting all the same. In the midst of this somber film, Paul Giamatt's character stands back from the sidewalk in Russia as a series of various dogs race by, yipping and barking. It was so unexpected and delightful, as were many small details in the movie. Details as small as a chickpea (if you see the film, you'll know what I mean).

I do not know if there are any parallels to 'Uncle Vanya' but now I have been inspired to watch that on film. I'm sure amazon prime offers at least one version of this play.

Now, I can imagine people wanting to store or get rid of part of their problematic brain, their screwed up conditioning. But the true self, the soul, the untouched beingness with which we enter the world? That's upside down thinking to me!

The other thing is, he didn't really change much depending on who's soul was supposedly inhabiting him. So was it all a placebo effect?  A great sales pitch? This was never explored.

Great acting, some really funny and intriguing moments, but a flat ending. And ultimately meaningless.",1520467200,,644,4.631578947368421

Can't imagine what they were thinking, taking on this first-time director and such a poorly-crafted script.
