8610341,5,B00EYNDEYS,"Wonderful DVD set from Railroad Video Productions, includes three marvellous shorts:

ON TO WASHINGTON 1939 was produced to promote travel on the Pennsy lines from Washington to the New York World's Fair.  Castle Films produced, but is not credited on the titles.  Runs about 18 minutes and is black and white. Lots of inviting footage of the fabulous GG1.

The last two films, in color, includes the very last film made for the PRR covering the proposed merger with New York Central, and the other the future of American railroads, which, in this day and age leaves much to be desired.

Total running time is about an hour. Distributed by Anchor Video.

A wonderful collection of the Pennsy Railroad long past but not forgotten by we who traversed its rails from Washington to New York and little hamlets along the way . . .",1440547200,,825,4.694444444444445
