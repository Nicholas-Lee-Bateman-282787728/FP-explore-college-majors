5045992,4,B00709GTR2,"I have tried about four of the Dancing with the Stars workouts but have only purchased, one, which was the Dancing with the Stars ""Dance Off the Pounds"".  Here's my take...Each I felt were well done, but it really depends on if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced exerciser.
The one dvd I do have is an intermediate/advanced workout.  I do have dance experience, I like a fast pace and I get bored easily and need to be challenged.  If you are looking for an easier one that I liked, the Latin Dance one with Cheryl Burke is a good one for a beginner.

This dvd is good, depending on what you like.  Some of the basic moves you will use in each dance are outlined by your instructors, Kym Johnson & Mark Ballas in the 7 minute warm-up sequence.  I'm not sure I love the warm-up and the instruction in that section, but it is not a huge deal.  The three types of dances that you will do are the Samba (17 minutes), the Salsa (16 minutes) and the Jive/Swing (15 minutes).  The instruction is good and the slower segments are the first two segments.  Once you get to the Swing/Jive, Mark Ballas really shows you how to make the dance really become a fat burner.  This was by far my favorite.  I would say intermediate on the first two sections and intermediate/advanced on the last one if you are following Mark.  It is very fast paced in some sections.  I loved it but I am thinking for a beginner this might be an exercise in frustration.
There is no cool-down at the end of the work-out, it just ends, which was different from the dvd I purchased.  I would recommend some hamstring stretches after just to keep things loose, but that is my opinion.

If you have done the Dancing the Pounds off dvd then you will remember some of the swing steps as they are the same, the Suzy Q, the triple step and the rock step.  I was a little disappointed there until I saw Mark add in a few other steps and then saw them working together.  The music is exactly the same as the Dancing the Pounds off music.  Strange, but maybe that is the best music to teach by...who knows.

Overall, I enjoyed it and am thinking about purchasing this one.  The samba/salsa is really fun and great for the abs and the swing/jive is great to keep the cardio up and to get you sweating.  As Mark will demonstrate you can really amp it up with making sure you have the swing/bounce and your knees really lifted on the steps.  He is a great instructor for this dance.

So, if you are looking for a beginner work-out, I would not pick this one, try the Latin Dance first and you can work up to this one.  If you have enjoyed the Dance of the Pounds, you will probably like this one and it is fast enough to keep you a little more challenged.
The workout goes quickly as for me dance feels more like fun and less like work.  Good instruction on the workouts and good pace overall.",1331510400,44,2855,4.271880819366853

5045999,4,B00709GTR2,"I want to write a review about DWTS program. I feel that if not all, at least 2 of the judges should be changed: Carrie Ann  and Bruno Tinioli. Carrie Ann  is an unfair judge, she grades according to whom she likes not the way the star perform, she was not always that way. Bruno is very unfair & he grades the male dancers higher than the female. besides he lack professionalism he shows too much sexuality with his gestures & comments, some of this gestures should be reserved to perform in bed, not on stage that is why I don't let my kids watch this show anymore. Lin Goodman used to be impartial but not as much anymore. The reading is going down because of those judges. The nice long gowns that the ladies ( stars & professional ) used to wear are not as attractive anymore like in seasons 1-5 & the introduction of the stars + dancers are not the same like before and the introductory musical theme was changed which make the last season a mess., I talk to a lots of people if it continue people will stop watching the show. Besides whoever Derick Hough dance with the judges have a tendency to over grade her, don't get me wrong Deric is a great dancer but many times the judges rather grade the stDericigher because it is Deric's partner.",1408233600,,1248,4.329059829059829

5046002,3,B00709GTR2,"The music is not as loud as the voices and the dancers are dressed in black/dark clothes against dark back ground and black floor so they kind of blend in and are not as visible. If you are completely new to dance you will have a hard time getting the steps because it's hard to see there feet/legs. Also, I would have liked to have had the steps told to me with the number of counts. That is the way I learned to dance. The but dances are fun.

5046005,4,B00709GTR2,"We have been fans of this series on television since the first season and my wife and I usually live vicariously through the dancers on the show as we cannot dance in anyway like them. Thus, when we were given the chance to try out this DVD we jumped at it.  The DVD states that it is for beginners and there are parts that seem to be geared toward this level of dancer (like my wife and I), but as the DVD progresses, the main instructors keep moving quickly, so you really have to watch fast to understand all of the moves. We loved the different dances you could work on and get better at. I think my favorite thus far is the jive and my wife's is the samba. One thing that was missing from this DVD was a cool down, so you will need to find a way to cool down after the exercise routine. Overall, this was quite enjoyable, and though fast at time, after a few times I found that I was catching on quickly. I would have to say that if I can do this, mostly anyone can!

5046008,5,B00709GTR2,I love Dancing With The Stars and this was a great video.  It is a great way to work out.,1363910400,,89,3.45
5046009,4,B00709GTR2,"The reviews for this video are all over the map, so I will add yet another opinion.  I had no difficulty in picking up the moves, but I can see that some people would.  I consider it advantage is that they don't spend a huge amount of time on the moves.  So while it might take a few viewings for you to learn the moves, it will have more interest after you learn them.  So if you pick up moves fairly easily or have the patience to work through it, you will probably like the video.  If you are a beginner who would find not being able to follow along immediately discouraging, then I'd suggest waiting before trying this.

Even with that said, I find in some sections they break down the moves enough where my heart rate could drop.  So in those spots I will continue doing the moves already covered, or some other simple but energetic moves (eg, jumping jacks) for a few moments.

I think Kym is probably the better instructor, but Mark's section is really enjoyable. I find myself having a lot of fun every time I do this video.  And it is a good workout, as long as you are willing to keep moving when they slow down slightly.

The review here by JJ is very informative and I recommend you read it for more information on the sections and dance types.  (Now I know the difference between swing and jive!)

The volume is a little off on this; the music is fairly quiet compared to the voices.  It has a music only option, which I haven't tried yet.  This and the 'false advertising' (see JJs review) are why I only give this 4 stars, even though it is 5 stars for fun. I generally use Just Dance for Wii for my aerobic exercise; this is one of the few videos that I think can compete with that series.",1359763200,8,1705,4.222222222222222
5046010,1,B00709GTR2,"I'm renting this video from the library. On the box it says in a blurb: ""Perfect for beginners! No Partner Needed!"" Well, after watching the warm-up I quickly realized I don't have the balance, coordination, and stamina for the pace they work these three dances: samba, salsa, and swing. I'm 52 yrs old, over 200 lbs, and definitely a beginner. I need to work up to such exertion. All three dances feature people in the background, but all of them are younger and look like they've had some dance training already.

For this to have worked for me, they would have needed to start out with the music about half the tempo it is, do a segment each per dance at that tempo until I got my body used to making those moves; THEN do a separate segment per dance at the advanced level. Because I'm doing well enough worrying about what my feet are doing without trying to figure out how to make my hips do a figure 8. Sheesh. So I'm turning this video back in very glad I didn't buy it. I hope this is helpful to someone as far as what to expect.",1357948800,2,1037,4.2639593908629445

If you are new to working out, this would be great for you, but it's definitely not for the person who has been working out for years. The best workout thus far is Jillian's 30-Day Shred. I got lean from that workout and it takes only 20 minutes. This Dancing with the Stars video is only a diversion, and I might do it once a week.

I just did the workout and would agree it's ok for cardio and has good instruction.  But  I expected DWTS would have decent music!  I was disappointed to hear monotonous instrumentals.  They didn't spring for anything that made you want to dance so I will not be buying DWTS exercise routines again. The music reminded me of bad VHS workout tapes--so boring I wanted to go to sleep, not dance.  My recommendation is buy something with better tunes!

They are very straight forward teachers and make sure to go slow enough so you can catch on, but fast enough so you get a workout and don't feel dumb.  I especially love swing.  Something I appreciate about these ""Dancing with the Stars"" workout videos is that you are able to use the moves you learn when you go dancing.

5046018,4,B00709GTR2,"This DVD has quickly become one of my favorites, however I do have to call it out on having false advertising.  On the front it clearly says ""perfect for beginners,"" and as other reviewers have said, that's not exactly true.  With that being said, this is still an intense workout that will definitely give you weight loss and a whole lot more.

There's about a seven-minute warm up to start things off.  It may be what the producers thought was perfect for beginners, because it breaks down key steps of each dance style.  Mark Ballas and Kym Johnson, the instructors, really teach fundamentals of the first few steps they'll actually show you in the dance routine to come.  Was it a warm up?  Not really.  There's no stretching or anything that will particularly get you loose and ready to go.  After viewing this the first time, I now skip it and warm up with the beginning of one of the routines.

SAMBA - 17 minutes - Kym leads Samba, and I think she does it very well.  This section is very bouncy and probably what I would call the intermediate part of the DVD.  If you're familiar with the Samba section from the older&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-With-the-Stars-Cardio-Dance/dp/B000MMMTC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing With the Stars - Cardio Dance</a>&nbsp;DVD, then you'll recognize some of them here.  If you're completely new to Samba, Kym begins by teaching some very basic steps and kind of breaking them down for you.  Each move gets progressively more difficult with some of the final moves being a bit complicated and fast.  This (and every other) section is broken down into three parts: combo 1 (5 minutes), combo 2 (5 minutes), and combo 3/put it all together (5-7 minutes).  This format keeps viewers from getting bored and taking it from the top all the time.

SALSA - 16 minutes - Mark joins Kym to teach the Salsa section, although they don't dance together; like the box says, no partner is needed.  For the most part, this is a very beginner=friendly section since the moves are relatively simple and compact.  I use this section as my warm up since I don't find that it spikes my heart rate that much.  Near the end, some VERY fast advanced steps are introduced, but before that time, each move is basic salsa that many people may have seen before if they've ever done Latin dancing.  Mark and Kym have good chemistry together and act cheesy but fun.  Kym is better as explaining each move while Mark is excellent at cuing.  It's also nice to see both the feminine approach to dance moves as opposed to the more masculine approach.

SWING/JIVE - 15 minutes - Once again, the DVD case has a bit of false advertising; this segment is called Swing, but apart from the first five minutes, it's definitely Jive.  For those who don't know the difference, Jive is about 2x as fast as Swing.  While this means that this is an intense workout, it's again not very good for beginners.  In fact, I'd almost call this routine advanced.  Mark leads viewers through complicated, fast, and high impact choreography.  Get ready to kick, jump, and hop almost constantly for fifteen minutes.  If you've seen the Swing/Jive section on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-with-the-Stars-Dance-Off-the-Pounds/dp/B002PLMJ6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing with the Stars: Dance Off the Pounds</a>, then this segment is very similar; the music is actually the same from that DVD, too.  If you've never done Swing or Jive before, then I can almost guarantee you will get lost and feel frustrated most of this segment.  It's a fantastic challenge; I'm in great shape and have difficulty finishing it.  It really makes the DVD a worthy purchase for advanced exercisers.

There is no Cool Down, and that really disappointed me.  In any workout, a cool down is necessary to stretch muscles, prevent soreness/injure, and feel good.  I usually add a cool down from another DVD, but I really wish the producers had at least tacked on some stretching on the end.  Why does it seem so hard for the makers of this series to put both a warm up AND cool down on the same DVD?

Overall, this DVD has a little something for everyone.  Salsa is (mostly) good for beginners, Samba is an excellent workout for intermediates, and Swing/Jive is a cardio challenge for advanced.  True, it's not 100% for beginners, but I like that each section is so diverse.  All of the moves are REAL dance moves and a blast to do; I never find myself getting bored with this DVD.  I recommend this DVD to mostly anyone with a word of caution to beginners: you may struggle with this DVD a bit at first.  However, if you're a fan of the show or ballroom dancing, this is a fun workout purchase for you to try.

5046021,5,B00709GTR2,"This latest DVD from the DWTS DVD line has become one of my favorites.  Again, I like to see different instructors and it's great to see Mark Ballas as an instructor.  He does a great job, breaking down the steps and doing them slowly, at first.
The first section in the Samba, which focuses on the abs.  Next, both instructors lead the Salsa, which is good.  I like doing a different routine.  But the real workout is the swing/jive, led by Mark.  This is fast action, high intensity cardio, which will enhance weight loss.
The front of the DVD says:  ""Perfect for Beginners!"" but I would  classify this as an intermediate workout because the last section is very intense.
AS another review pointed out, the warm-up  section is sort of a ""dance lesson"", which is fine, but do you keep wanting to ""learn"" th moves to warm up?
The DVD also lacks a cool down segment, which you need after burning up the dancefloor during the swing/jive.
So I do my own stretches, no big deal.

The last dance, the Swing, is the one that I liked best and would most likely do again.  But the real problem with this workout is that there is NO WARM UP, NO COOL DOWN, and NO STRETCHING.  (What they call a warm up on the back jacket, is only dance instruction for their steps  - it's not a warm up at all.)  I'm going to keep this dvd, but doubt that I'll be using it that much.

8507592,4,B00709GTR2,"This is a pretty good cardio workout but you should have some prior dance experience or be fairly well coordinated. It takes about 5-6 times of trying the video to get some of the steps down. I have tried 2 other DWTS cardio tapes and this one is the best, the other tapes were poorly planned, a little but awkward to watch and there was little repetition.
The first part of this DVD has Kym doing some basic steps, she is good about repeating any new steps and adding them to the existing routine. If you have a hard time figuring out the steps I found it helpful to watch the other dancers, sometimes they are easier to follow. The second part of the DVD is lead by Lacey. Her routine has similar steps as part one but at a faster tempo. She also is very good about repetition. Again, if you have a hard time learning certain steps you can look at the other background dancers - they can be helpful. The third part of the DVD is impossible. It is not well thought out and a slow tempo with a very difficult dance, it is not worth trying in my opinion.
Once you have the routine down the first 2  parts are a little over 30 minutes and a good work out. My only criticism is the music, it is OK at first but does not add to the experience. Also you can watch the routines without instruction but this only means that you watch them dancers do exactly what they do for the routines with instruction only there are no voices heard. Not sure why they did this because it is not helpful at all. It would have been better to have them repeat the entire routine over and over with great music and reminders about what steps come next.
