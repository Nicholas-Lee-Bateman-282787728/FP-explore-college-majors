8304244,4,B001G7EXKY,this one was good because i thought it would be like a special dog that he would have to protect that was a TV star or something but that wasn't it.  it was good.  Good Inspector Gadget stuff.  If you don't download Gadget you'll want to get it because it is not on DVD. if you like Get Smart you might like Gadget because it is Don Adams being oblivious.,1367193600,,355,4.042857142857143
