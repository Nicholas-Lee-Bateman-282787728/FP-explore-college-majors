We would like to get a copy of the video.  How can we do that?  It is said that it isn't known when and if it will be available.  Will it ever be shown on TV again?",1224806400,19,330,4.125

The movie is a wonderfully funny and heartwarming story about a ""lost"" engagement ring and the consequences thereafter.  Whenever I need a good laugh, I replay this movie.

8300954,5,B001F42ND2,"Coming from a first generation of Italians I related whole heartedly to the roles of the characters and personalities portrayed in this film. As always the food was the common denominator for all and any discussions of consequence. Then came the wine to polish off the decisions and in this case it was the basis for blending the talent and vineyards of the two families. Oh the arguments, the various inflections recalling my youth. Wonderful research picking out the phrases and mannerisms so very typical of the immigrants of the period.
Kudos to the writers and film-makers and to the actors for their abilities in making the story ""Real"".",1374624000,,643,4.908256880733945
