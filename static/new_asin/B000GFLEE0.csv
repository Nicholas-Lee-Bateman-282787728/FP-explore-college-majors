8131304,3,B000GFLEE0,"Pop Flix presents Lee Van Cleef in Grand Duel and Captain Apache two of Van Cleef's popular films,Grand Duel being the better of the two,Van Cleef is a lone wolf Sheriff trying to prove the innocence of a desperate gunslinger on the run. Pretty good plot,music score,and a few bullets flying here and there. Captain Apache,Van Cleef is a half breed soldier they call red a--,investigating an Indian agent murdered with the last dying words 'april morning'.Descent plot,good supporting cast,Stuart Whitman,Carrol Baker. The one thing I couldn't take was the wig Van Cleef sported,it was as bad as his singing the theme song of the soundtrack,also this Pop Flix dvd claims to have remastered these films but that's questionable,however the tranfers aren't that bad and you can't go wrong for the price.",1214438400,2,800,5.068181818181818
