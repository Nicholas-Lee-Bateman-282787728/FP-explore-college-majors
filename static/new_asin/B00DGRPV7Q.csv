8593029,3,B00DGRPV7Q,"While I do think the movie could have been more polished, the story was great.  It tells the story of Yemenite Jewish woman arrives in the holy land in 1880s and her journey through life up to Israel's independence.  I can't wait to read the book now, the Pomegranate Pendant, that its based on.",1391731200,,295,4.444444444444445
