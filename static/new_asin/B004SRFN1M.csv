8440160,1,B004SRFN1M,"The trailer was beautiful and visionary, but the video to me, was just a bunch of druggies ranting on how enlightened they'd become using drugs - very little real content - lots of superfluous detail - I used to write a very practical newsletter column on Transformation for the fellow who wrote RESOLVING UNFINISHED BUSINESS  - on our social inheritance of dysfunctional behaviors - recommend it highly also WHEN SOCIETY BECOMES AN ADDICT - Schaef.  Or for ideas for visionary books - Tom Butler-Bowden's.",1488240000,,506,5.011904761904762

8440162,5,B004SRFN1M,"This is informative and a counter to all the doomsday scenarios we can collectively imagine for the future of the planet.
We are smart enough and wise enough to pull back from the brink of an overheated and dead planet. If you care deeply about this topic you will find this encouraging and useful.",1388361600,,298,4.537037037037037
8440163,5,B004SRFN1M,"I cannot say enough good about this movie...it made me want to get up and act...and it states what I've always believed, there are enough resources out there, they are just mismanaged.

But rather than a negative gloom and doom, this film presents many different individuals creating sustainable water treatment, energy, land use, etc. etc. etc....and so many positive, wonderful solutions to the problems we face.

And of course the true change, isn't 'trickling down"" it's all growing up, grass roots.  I wish I could send a copy of this to everyone I've ever met, have it shown in every school, every church, etc. etc. etc.",1321142400,3,626,4.886792452830188
8440164,5,B004SRFN1M,Excellent movie that I will highly recommend to everybody around the globe to watch. Some will simply open their eye and wake up from unconsciousness and for some it will be a reminder of what is happening around us on everyday basis.,1307232000,10,234,4.595238095238095
8440165,5,B004SRFN1M,"We have officially entered the time where changes are happening so fast that it takes a film like this to remind us we are on the cusp of a completely new world.

This film is an excellent piece for people who may be new to ""the 2012 phenomenon"", and is an especially welcome reprieve from the incessant doom-and-gloom prognostications of planetary destruction.  Instead, this film focuses on the fact that we stand at a crossroads in the way we live, technically, politically, spiritually, the works. With  simple actionable ways to participate in the coming shift, it offers a glimpse into the new world being born.

It is inspiring, informative, and empowering.  A big thank-you to Daniel Pinchbeck and the whole team who worked on this film!",1302566400,18,745,4.880952380952381
8440166,5,B004SRFN1M,"I just viewed this movie today and was inspired and impressed by its message and delivery. I believe it to be a ""must see"" film.
I enjoyed the manner and style of the author as he interviews a variety of interesting & inspirational people knowledgeable in their respective fields. I also enjoyed its wholes-tic approach in covering the major elements pertinent to environmental as well as personal transformation concerns & needs of humanity. I would further say that it 'should' be required viewing by everyone so that we can collectively move forward into a sound world vision instilling a harmonious, uplifting experience as a humanity. We can & will adjust, the only question is how much more suffering are we willing to endure as we resist the changes necessary in order to be in harmony with the Spirit behind all things?

I think Gandhi stated it best when he said, "" Be the change you want to see in the world.""",1301443200,14,919,4.708074534161491
