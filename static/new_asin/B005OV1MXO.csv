8482091,5,B005OV1MXO,"Sometimes, I would like to write a review that contains just two words: ""Buy this!""

Occasionally, I get an opportunity to hear music, or a performance, or to see a film that is so good that I have trouble finding the best words to share my enthusiasm. This is one of those cases.

Conductor Yutaka Sado's first performance with the Berlin Philharmoniker was a concert to raise funds for relief efforts following the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011. The program that Sado chose was unique: From me flows what you call time, by Toru Takemitsu, is rarely performed, and is difficult work to play, calling for highly skilled percussionists. Following this was Shostakovitch's 5th symphony.

My interest in this disc stems from a long love of Takemitsu's music. From me flows what you call time was commissioned by Carnegie Hall in 1990 for its centenary celebrations. Featuring five percussionists and orchestra, it could be termed a concerto for percussion and orchestra. (Takemitsu wrote no works called ""concerto"" or ""symphony"".) It begins with a haunting, Japanese-style melody on solo flute (played by Emmanuel Pahud, who plays with the Berlin Philharmoniker.) Then the five percussionists enter the hall through five different doors, and walk slowly to the stage playing timbals. Each is wearing a different coloured shirt: blue, red, yellow, green and white. These colours are those found in the Tibetan flag, and symbolize water, fire, earth, wind and sky. There are also long ribbons from either side of the stage to hanging bells suspended from the roof of the hall; each side has a set of five ribbons in the same colors.

When the percussionists get to the stage, the work truly begins, with waves of sound from the orchestra in Takemitsu's signature style, interspersed with playing by the percussionists. For more than thirty minutes, this back and forth goes on, with the percussion instruments taking longer parts, and using more varied instruments. Everything is there: talking drums, singing bowls, hanging bells and dozens of other percussion instruments. There are several sections where the percussionists improvise around a loosely grouped series of notes.

And then it ends.

As I said, finding the words to describe this is difficult, but if I had to choose one for this work, it would be: riveting. For more than a half hour, I found myself absorbed in the complex, variegated sound world that Takemitsu had created. But it was more than the sound; seeing this work being performed, seeing the vast range of instruments, the colours, and the expressions on the faces of the musicians, who were clearly enjoying this work, was very moving. At the end, the huge smile on Yutaka Sado's face, and the rapturous applause, suggested that everyone had shared in this unique moment.

After an intermission came Shostakovich's 5th Symphony. I find myself unqualified to discuss this work, which I do not know very well, but I had goose bumps as the work came to an end. The sheer energy and passion of the orchestra was astounding. Seeing Yutaka Sado drenched in sweat, yet occasionally breaking out in a childish smile was touching.

Everything on this disc is as good as it gets. The music, notably the rarely performed, and rarely recorded work by Takemitsu. Excellent musicians, and a conductor who gave all his energy in this concert. Excellent camerawork, lighting, direction and video quality. And perhaps the finest sound I've head on a Blu-Ray disc; the recording of both of these works has nearly perfect balance and detail.

After I finished watching this disc, I immediately went back to the beginning to watch the Takemitsu again. I hope you will too.",1376611200,3,3700,5.003252032520325
8482092,5,B005OV1MXO,"It's the Berlin Philharmonic!! No more really needs to be said, but I will. It's a great performance of Shostakovich's 5th coupled with an interesting and outstanding performance of a modern work by Takemitsu. Percussion fans should enjoy the Takemitsu as it features the members of the orchestra's percussion section. I found the Shostakovich quite moving, maybe a little more than an equally fine one by MTT and the San Francisco S.O. from his ""Keeping Score"" series. That one is coupled w/a discussion of the work by MTT and members of the orchestra. So, it might come down to your choice of couplings, what the heck get them both they won't disappoint.",1364947200,,656,4.866071428571429
8482093,5,B005OV1MXO,"The Berliner Philharmoniker conducted by Yutaka Sako is one of the best blu-ray concert discs I have ever seen (and I have experienced quite a few).  First, the selection of music is nothing short of dazzling; Second, the conducting and the orchestral performance is most remarkable;  Third, the audio sinqued with the video is clear and understandable--like few other recordings.  Fourth, the extras are generous, including a commentary by Yutaka Sako, an impressive new face with the Berlin Philharmonic.  You will enjoy his conducting, his cues, his enthusiasm for the music!  Whole-heartedly recommended!",1323907200,3,608,5.494623655913978
8482094,5,B005OV1MXO,"I've just been very rude in a review of the two-CD set of this concert, not because of the musical content but because of the impact of the visuals on this DVD.

If ever there was a piece which demonstrated that CD-only and downloads of music have had it - or are on the way out - then the Takemitsu performance on this DVD goes some long way to showing why.

CD freaks, test yourselves.  Buy the CDs [at incredible prices] or listen to this DVD, to be played with the visuals off.  Play the Takemitsu - just over half an hour - and enjoy.  It's a haunting, moving piece, but stick with it if you're not used to a fine composer [I've loved him since Ozawa's November Steps, issued first on LP].  Then beg, borrow or steal a DVD player, and watch the Takemitsu.

If your comprehension of the music, your delight in its development, your admiration for the master musicians involved are not increased a thousandfold, then by all means lead the poor, insufficient life offered by MP3s and the rest.

The Shostakovitch is no mean feat - see the other reviews - and the BluRay may well be better than the DVD for sound.  But it's the visuals that win here, in immaculate presentation.  What an experience!",1323388800,7,1200,4.413636363636364
8482095,5,B005OV1MXO,"As the British would say ""That was bloody brilliant!"" In truth, I don't know where to start on a list of superlatives. To begin with, this is by far the best audio recording on Bluray that I've heard to date. It sounds like very close miking, because all instruments are highlighted. The shear power of the cellos and basses at the start of the second movement of the Shostakovich puts me in mind of the Decca audio recordings of the sixties.( This is the sound I wanted to hear, but didn't, in the recent Chailly Mahler 2 at the very start of the symphony.) The last movement took my breath away, and had me leaping up off the couch to conduct! The very last bars with the combined timpani and bass drum will blow you away. Contrast this with the almost inaudible timpani on the Tilson Thomas recording, now sounding pretty limp by comparison to this one.

The Shostakovich 5 is a super reading, with the first and third movements very persuasively done, in a very layered fashion. As previously noted, the Allegretto and Allegro are very exciting. The Berlin Phil. is its usual wonderful self - these players collectively have no peers, in my opinion.

Yutaka Sato, the conductor, is new to me, but I look forward to hearing and seeing him again soon. He is quite the dancer! Frequently airborne, the only dance step not is his routine appears to be the pirouette. A lot of fun to watch, he really gets into the music!

The other main item on the menu is a piece by Toru Takemitsu, for four percussionists (apparently from the BPO)and orchestra. It is called ""From me flows what you call time"" and it is a fascinating piece, which I shall return to often, if only to enjoy the fabulous expertise of the percussionists, playing a variety of instruments. Once again, the recording is exemplary. There is a bonus interview with Sato, which is worth listening to once only.

As I said, this renders the Tilson Thomas recording of the Shostakovich 5 irrelevant. I've always had a soft spot for this piece, bombast and all, and it may be the best available, cd or video. This recording certainly sets the bar high for ANY future Bluray release of this or any other work. I'm still shaking my head in amazement!",1323129600,7,2206,4.563131313131313
8482096,5,B005OV1MXO,"I have not yet seen the DVD nor heard the CD, but I attended this concert live in Berlin last May. In a lifetime of concert-going, this was certainly one of the most entrancing and captivating that I have ever experienced. Pure musical magic, nothing less. Because of very interesting visuals in the Takemitsu piece (you'll understand what I mean when you see it), I'm buying the Blu-ray version.",1322611200,5,396,4.753623188405797
8482097,5,B005OV1MXO,"If you are looking for a marvelous Shostakovich Five, here it is. Yutaka Sado and the Berliner Philharmoniker - in superb form all the way - give a smashing performance of the composer's answer to Stalin and arguably his most popular work. From the brooding Moderato through the sarcastic Allegretto and the beautiful though utterly desolate Largo to the martial and ultimately ""triumphant"" Allegro non troppo, everything is done with enormous energy, with subtlety and the ""right"" tempi throughout. Listening to this is an emotional experience of the first order: you will be deeply touched by the performance. Yutaka Sado is a new name to me, and I will be sure to keep an eye on his outstanding talent in the future. The Takemitsu piece for five percussionists and orchestra is certainly intriguing. I hope that repeated listening will help me find my way into its exotic realm. For now, I welcome the challenge. Add excellent audio and video and you have a clear winner in this disk.",1321833600,8,987,4.880952380952381
