8345430,1,B001UZCPDE,"Well, this is certainly not what I expected.  Ridiculous costume party nonsense. Dubbed by a few friends that had nothing to do once the bars closed. After 5 minutes you'll find yourself wondering if this is the movie, or a pre-movie joke.  I even stopped the film, went back to the menu, and tried to find the REAL movie. Alas, I had already witnessed the real movie and there was nothing I could do to turn back time!

Not even a room full of inebriated b-movie afficionados would be able to sit through this. Don't waste your time or money.",1372291200,,543,4.41
8345431,5,B001UZCPDE,"This one almost goes beyond parody, it's so over the top and campy.  But that works in its favor.  I watched Isle of the Damned with an audience of 70's Italian cannibal film lover and a couple of ordinary girls.  Everyone enjoyed themselves.  The humor is broad.  If you love sodomy AND jungle cannibalism, even better!

Plus, any film that utilizes the phrase, ""boy pussy"" should get an Oscar nomination at the very least.  If you love the genre that Isle of the Damned is spoofing, then you need to see this.

IotD exploits ( ""exploit"" may not be strong enough of a word) all the retardedness of cheesy italian horror. The only thing this film is missing is a cameo from Udo Kier. Which i hear, thru the grapevine, when the film is re-released in 2014, they're going to re-edit the film to include scenes that where intended to be in the original but do to budgetary restraints and limited special effect capabilities they were not permitted to do so. The director of this film, Antonello Giallo, said only 5.72% off his intended vision for this film made it to production. This is to include several scenes with a young, computer generated Udo Kier as the Nazi Commandant.

Pee your pants fun

Buy the movie, watch the movie, pee your pants, change your pants, continue watching the movie.

thats all im gonna say.

8345433,5,B001UZCPDE,"I love this movie. It nails everything perfectly that it wanted to accomplish. So very (and intentionally) over the top, but not ridiculous or pretentious. If you love horror, - and by horror I mean Cannibal Holocaust, Argento, Fulci and the like - you will enjoy this film for many repeat viewings.
Everything you love about those movies is done 1000% from the outrageous costumes and gore to the dubbing and musical score.
Mark Cosgrove has expertly directed this film in a way that makes you laugh, and squirm the whole way through without the intentional excess seeming overdone or leaving you felling bored.
This film is not for the faint of heart, you WILL want to vomit,but you'll be laughing the whole time your doing it.
So get a group of friends, a case of beer and enjoy!!",1245283200,4,783,4.640287769784172
