5622000,5,B00BHWG0N6,"Love that they are releasing this.  The show didn't really hold up in Hollywood, but they still had some terrific episodes and guest stars.  Hopefully they will release Season 5 of Happy Days as well.",1369440000,,200,4.685714285714286
5622001,3,B00BHWG0N6,"After Paramount/CBS finally caved in to public pressure (and at times outright demands) for the fifth installment of Laverne & Shirley to be released following a four-year gap, it seems they decided to go ahead and release the sixth season after all.  This is where it all started going south, folks(or West depending on your opinion--lol), and what ultimately led to the series cancellation two years later.

After losing their jobs at Shotz Brewery due to automation, the girls decided they've had enough of Milwaukee and pack up their belongings to start anew in California.  They move from the meager basement apartment on Knapp Street to settle in a split-level dwelling in Burbank, CA.  The rest of the gang decided to pull up stakes, so L&S figured it was time for a fresh start too.  They hitch a ride across the country with Lenny & Squiggy--who also decide to settle in the same building.  Instead of shouting up a dumbwaiter, we now see the gang keeping in touch with one another via a cubby hole situated underneath the stairway.  We meet two new cast of characters: hunky landlord Sonny St. Jacques(Ed Marinaro who curiously enough only stuck around for one season), and lighter-than-fluffy airhead Rhonda Lee, played by Leslie Easterbrook who professes to be an ""actress/model/singer/dancer"". The girls' blue-collar background clashes with that of Rhonda's, who is constantly making a nuisance of herself by hosting swanky parties and, interestingly enough, driving Lenny and Squiggy to the point of sexual frustration. Of course the guys have no luck getting lucky with her, hence their plots and schemes to try and get Rhonda to date them always backfired...

Their choice for employment in the Golden State is a department store called ""Bardwell's"", run by a no-nonsense, strict to the point Boss named Mr. Hildebrand (played by veteran performer Norman Bartold). They are employed as gift-wrappers in customer service and are constantly seeking ways to earn promotions/raises, all to no avail.  The chemistry between these new characters was a little choppy at times, and I question the wisdom of adding the character of Rhonda-Lee, who always came across as the stereotypical ""dumb blonde"" talking about herself in the third person and proclaiming to be an actress in high demand around the Hollywood area.  For such a ""big star"" to be living in a modest apartment building was curious enough, but I always cringed whenever she was given any real screen time.  There was just something about her demeanor that turned me off.  The character of Sonny, however, was a fresh addition to the cast, and he made sure his tenants were always safe and sound in their new surroundings, especially after an earthquake on the girls' first night had them reconsidering their move to California...

Frank and Edna have already relocated prior to the girls' arrival, opening up a western themed BBQ restaurant called ""Cowboy Bill's"".  Edna would eventually divorce Frank the following season after (supposedly) running off with a new beau and leaving Frank to wallow in his misery.  Betty Garrett left after the first season in California, as did Ed Marinaro. These departures were then followed by Cindy Williams, Michael McKean, and finally, Eddie Mekka.  By the time the 8th season rolled around however, the series had become a shadow of its former self, the writing terrible, and it was clear that nobody was giving a darn anymore.  They weren't even trying. The show, for all practical purposes, was a sinking ship that the public had largely forgotten about by that point.

In retrospect, once Cindy Williams left over a contract dispute (which Paramount denied saying it was because of Williams' pregnancy at the time), they should've wrapped everything up then.  Penny Marshall even said so herself in all the years that followed.  The series frankly should have been cancelled mid-season and the time-slot filled with re-runs. Instead, we saw Laverne bumbling her way through part-time jobs/relationships/misadventures and mishaps, only to realize the show had become unwatchable by then.  The series finale focuses on Carmine bidding farewell to the remaining cast as he sets off for New York City to try his luck on Broadway...

To summarize, the three seasons spent in California seem to divide the fan community, most agreeing that the only watchable season was this one, season 6.  There were a few memorable episodes that stood out, such as the ""Bardwell Caper"", but all in all, the show was beginning to lose steam at this stage.  The series was dropping further and further in the ratings, and the public's tastes were shifting as a host of new TV shows were taking over the airwaves. By the ""end of the line"" sort of speak, everyone looked like they were just standing around waiting for their final paychecks from this thing.  A sad and forgettable ending to what was once the most popular sitcom on Prime-Time TV.  Maybe they'll go ahead with Seasons 7 and 8, or maybe this set is simply being released as a reminder of how great the ""Milwaukee Years"" were, who knows?  What I do know is, as far as any of the California episodes that aired, this one's all that really matters.  It was all downhill from here, folks.

Enjoy, nonetheless.

*UPDATE*

It has now been over a week since this set was released.  I've had the chance to view all discs and episodes and noticed that some of the music I remember from the original broadcasts has been replaced with generic, easy-listening type fluff.  There is missing footage on the ""Malibu Mansion"" episode, so much so that it breaks the continuity and flow of the program to the point where it almost doesn't make sense.  All in all, they've clearly cut corners and cheapened the production on this set, and yet we're still paying a good price for what we THOUGHT were the original and uncut episodes taken directly from the vaults of the studio masters?  Once again, the logic and common sense of these guys makes absolutely no sense to me.  COME ON, Paramount.  Please tell me you aren't that bloody cheap?  If you plan on pulling this stunt, you can count me out as far as buying Season 7 goes.  Don't even bother with the disaster that was Season 8.  Sorry, but I'm not pleased.",1368144000,14,6251,4.899335232668566
5622002,5,B00BHWG0N6,This season is still great. I love it because the whole cast is still together and I love the Welcome to Burbank show. The earthquake in Laverne and Shirley room was funny. I love the sink being pulled off the wall and Laverne hanging to the chandlier. The beginning of this season they are leaving Milwaukee and quit Shotz. When the boss fired them they should not have quit. They could have received unemployment benefits. LOL,1367798400,,428,4.644736842105263
5622003,5,B00BHWG0N6,"I am happy that the Laverne & Shirley series are finally continuing. This was a great TV series, good family entertainment and a wecome addition to my collection.",1364169600,11,162,4.821428571428571
5622004,4,B00BHWG0N6,"This is season 6 and this is when they all go to California. I am suprised that they are releasing this season-I thought they would stop at Season 5(their best season in my opinion). With that being said I am very glad they are releasing this and hopefully the last 2 seasons too(the last season was only Laverne-the worst season but would still buy to complete my collection).

This season did have its moments like the motel trial, the earthquake and the best is their break-in at Bartwells(I think that is whhere they worked).

I loved this silly show when it was on the air. Thanks for releasing-already preordered!",1361491200,28,619,4.669724770642202
5622005,4,B00BHWG0N6,"I honestly thought after Season 5 of ""Laverne and Shirley"" was released--the last season to be set in Milwaukee--we'd seen the last of this show on DVD. But lo and behold, CBS has seen fit to bless us with the 6th season which chronicles the girls' Lucy Show-esque move to the West Coast affording plenty of opportunity for star-gazing and crazy schemes to break into show biz.

All twenty-two episodes that aired on ABC during the 1980-81 season are here, which introduce two new characters that come with the girls' new digs. Hunky apartment manager/stuntman Sonny (Ed Marinaro) proves to be competition for Carmine as the two often try to out-macho one another; and self-centred, buxom blonde neighbour Rhonda (Leslie Easterbrook) wraps drooling Lenny and Squiggy around her little finger as easily as she irritates Laverne and Shirley. Frank and Edna come along for the ride and open a new cowboy-themed restaurant.

Although the physical comedy bits aren't as memorable as in seasons' past, there are some good episodes here, the best probably being the two-part ""Bardwell Caper"" where the girls must hatch an elaborate plan to retrieve a letter from their boss' locked office (they get jobs as department store gift-wrappers this season). It features a great fake-out ending to Part One and is perhaps the best script the cast plays this season.

Notable guest stars include Fred Dryer, Richard Moll, Troy Donahue and Vicki Lawrence.

Many say the show Jumped the Shark with the move to Hollywood. That may have been true in the long run, but there's still enough enjoyable episodes to recommend getting this one. The Shirley-free Season 8 is another story altogether.

FOUR STARS and a big thank-you to CBS for continuing the series on DVD!

**WARNING** Music licensing fees have caused a scene to be cut from the episode ""Malibu Mansion"" featuring a musical performance from the biker gang (led by ""Night Court's"" Richard Moll) that crashes the party.",1361318400,28,1959,5.012307692307692

5622020,5,B00BHWG0N6,"Stilly funny decades later! Laverne & Shirley is one of the best T.V. shows ever produced. Laverne & Shirley and the gang move to California in Season 6 and while I thought it wouldn't be as good as previous seasons, I was wrong! In fact, it was better than Season 5, which I found to be quite a downer as it dealt with death and some other really depressing subjects (suicide, etc.). Season 6 was full of surprises, although the character Rhonda I always found to be a bit much and Sonny could have been used a bit more, in my opinion. I enjoyed each and every episode and laughed out loud and hard many times. My favorite has to be ""I Do, I Do, I Do,"" because I'm a huge fan of Peter Noone (Herman's Hermits). I love that they did their own stunts, or at least Penny did, I'm not sure if Cindy did all her own stunts. The gag reel left a lot to be desired, but all in all a great season and a show that never gets old. I will miss seeing Happy Days characters pop in on them though. Can't wait to start Season 7.",1425427200,,1014,4.0497512437810945

While Happy Days lost its spark After Ron Howard left, and Fonzie started developing E.S.P. There were a couple of favorites I'd love to see again.
