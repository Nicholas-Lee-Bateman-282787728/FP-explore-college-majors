7946015,1,B00005MNUX,"I ordered this for my husband and I and let me tell you...It was a huuuuge waste! We watched the DVD and instead of us learning new things and getting turned on it was the complete oposite! We already knew everything and we were completely turned OFF! The whole DVD is interviewing couples about their sex lives. And the couples were AWFUL to look at! What made it even worse was that every once in a while the couples would do a sex scene and it was very gross! They weren't attractive people AT ALL, and not in good shape! It was so hard to watch the DVD we eventually turned it off and won't turn it on again! This DVD is a total mood killer and a make you sick movie! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS DVD OR YOUR MONEY!",1124755200,186,720,4.077464788732394

7946018,5,B00005MNUX,"We got this tape as wedding gift. I thought it was a gag Gift. My new wife and I had been trying to find her G spot for about a year. All our friends seem to know were it was and they were enjoying multiple orgasms. My wife's best friend's boyfriend told me how to get to the G spot, But no luck, so three weeks after our honeymoon my wife asked me if I would watch it with her.
The video is very well produced Dr. Linda seems very nice and speaks simply. What were most helpful were the latex models and 3d animation takes you inside the woman to show you where it is and how to stimulate it. Everyday couples relate their problems and made it easy to connect with. Although many people have told us how to find the GSpot  this Video was the only thing that helped us find it. We should have taken it on our Honeymoon",1023062400,95,818,4.0184049079754605
7946019,5,B00005MNUX,"After reading two books and tons of magazine articles on the subject  and not having any success finding the elusive pleasure spot we were  convinced  that perhaps the whole G Spot thing was just a myth.  My wife heard about this tape on the radio and ordered it.  I must be honest, I did not hold out much hope. What a pleasant surprise I was about to get. "" A Guide To the G Spot"", is just that, Dr. Linda De Villers  is very professional while having a sense of humor about  the whole thing. Great 3D animation and latex molds Guide you right to the G Spot. Dr Linda and the real couples featured in the video give you insight into different techniques.  The demonstration scenes were very tasteful and erotic and helped get us into the mood.  By the time the tape was finished we had found my wife's G Spot  and experienced a whole new aspect to our love life. There is a G Spot! And this tape  "" A guide to the G Spot and EXTREME Multiple Orgasms""  is the only  thing we found that actually showed us the way.",998179200,70,1014,4.164948453608248
