8420349,4,B004AJDEHI,"I bought this Elmo DVD for my 2 year old son since he loves Elmo. Zoe talks about wanting long hair and goes into different fairy tales. My son loves to sing along with the ""hair"" song. This is a great movie to have if you want a recent Elmo movie, but he watches it so often that I am getting tired of it. I'm ready for the next Elmo DVD.",1301011200,2,339,3.788732394366197
8420350,3,B004AJDEHI,"""Silly Storytime"" is a journey to a fairy-tale land with Elmo and his Sesame Street friends in retellings of ""Rapunzel,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" and ""Little Red Riding Hood.""

Zoe wishes she has longer hair just like Rapunzel, but when her Hairy Godperson grants her wish, it puts Zoe in a predicament.  Prince Elmo tries to break an evil spell cast on Sleeping Grouchy that makes her sleep for 100 years.  His other Sesame Street pals help Jack grow a beanstalk.  Finally, the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood sing about the parts of a face in a musical version of the classic tale.

An added bonus is a quartet of ""Kermit News"" segments starring Kermit the Frog.",1297814400,,692,4.639344262295082
