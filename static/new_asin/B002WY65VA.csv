4008176,5,B002WY65VA,"John Keats is still hailed as one of the greatest of the Romantic Poets and Writer/Director Jane Campion offers a biographically centered yet lyrically poetic version of the few years that that inspired so many memorable works.  She has carefully studied the letters of John Keats to his muse Fanny Brawne, researched the period in and around 1818 and has devised a love story that ranks with the finest of Romantic writers.  This is a film to absorb slowly, with repeated viewings, a dream like tale of just what the measured passions of the period were like during the time in which they unfolded.

There is a strange triangle here: Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish of 'A Good Year' and 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age') lives with her mother (the subtle actress Kerry Fox) and here siblings (fine, detailed performances by Edie Martin and Thomas Sangster).  In part of the house lives one Charles Armitage Brown (Paul Schneider of 'Lars & the Real Girl', 'The Assassination of Jesses James...', etc), a wannabe artist who shares his living space with John Keats (the brilliant Ben Wishaw of 'Perfume', 'Brideshead Revisited', 'I'm Not There' etc) who along with writing poetry he finds difficult to publish is caring for his dying brother.  Brown loves Keats and is devoted to his happiness, but vies for the attention of Fanny who is caught up in her own 'artistry' of sewing.  From Keats Fanny learns about poetry, a form of art she has not encountered, and in the times she spends with Keats as her teacher she simultaneously avoids the advances of Brown and instead feels her heart awaken to Keats. Fanny's mother sees Keats' gifts and deeply admires him, but warns her daughter not to become involved with a poet who cannot support her expectations of marriage into wealth.  The triangle of love and devotion among Keats, Brown, and now Fanny is the core of the story and is handled in the most subtle way that few other directors than Campion could accomplish.

Keats develops tuberculosis and for heath reasons is instructed to go to the warmer climes of Italy for recovery.  It is from Italy that Keats writes his letters (and a poem 'Bright Star') to Fanny  that seals the hearts and souls of the two delicate lovers.  Keats succumbs to his disease and Fanny continues her life of celibacy, wandering the heath, longing for the love of her life.

The DVD offers comments form Jane Campion regarding the making of this film and her insights into the characters shed precious light on the film.  The cast is exceptional, with stunning portrayals by Wishaw, Cornish, Schneider and Fox.  This is a gentle film to treasure, much the way we still treasure the poems of the inimitable John Keats.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 10",1264809600,3,2736,4.814102564102564
4008177,2,B002WY65VA,"This movie is more on the theatrical side.

 I do not know how close to the real love story but considering that there is nothing extraordinary or flashing going on during the movie (more typical in Hollywood movie) witch some might find it a little bit boring, the love story is probable accurate in details.

It is a beautiful love story between Frances Brawne ""Fanny"" and poet John Keats, who's true talent was never recognize during his life time, and yet many will say was to some degree equal to Byron's and Shelley`s.

The action is slow and Keats poetry is the "" background voice"" of many scenes .

Personally,  in many scenes I did not felt the year of 1818 as it was in Jane Austen literature.

Fanny was a 18 year old beautiful and talented seamstress ( by pleasure and not profession) who was living with her widow mother and her two siblings. Her clothing where showing a more eccentric 1818 fashion ( witch was intended ) but her hair style was more an 1860 fashion.

The mother had a very modern relationship with the daughter,  and some times almost an unnatural behavior as a mother.  She has NEVER give any advice, she NEVER show any concern, or clear objection to her daughter's choice, something that one would expect in the begging of 19 century, when a mother would have a much more powerful influence in a daughters life and in many cases MAKE the decisions for her. But the part that strike me most was when Fanny receive the worst news and the mother did not rush to comfort her until was call several times. The mother, through out the movie was more of shadow moving from one scene to another and who occasionally had a line or two.

Fanny had a 14 year old brother  Samuel and a 9 year old sister Margaret ""Tots"". The brother  was always following her quiet and never had a line. There was something about this appearance that I really liked, he was almost like a guardian angel always watching over her.

Fanny's infatuation with Keats was clear and well portrayed by the actress, but I NEVER felt Keats passion for her.

His words and his poetry for Fanny where full of passion but his acting and facial expression where very cold. There was no fire burning inside his heart or eyes and the occasional scenes where we should see his passion and desire for Fanny where not express very well by the actor. To me he seem very cold.

Overall this movie is one of those movies that you either love or hate. For some is a passionate love story, sprinkle with 19 century poetry, while for others is a long, boring and depressing movie.

4008178,5,B002WY65VA,I just watched this movie and love it. This is one of my favorite romance movies and would recommend owning it. The scenery and passion the characters have is inspiring and moving a must see.,1264723200,,191,4.485714285714286
4008179,5,B002WY65VA,Bright Star was an amazing movie. It moves both your heart and your soul. Make sure you have tissues handy. If you love Jane Austen you'll love this movie.,1264636800,,155,4.379310344827586
4008180,5,B002WY65VA,"This is a movie that romantics will savor over and over - and the fact that it is based on the true love story between Romantic poet John Keats and his muse, Fanny Brawne, makes it all the more riveting. In director Jane Campion's able hands, ""Bright Star"" is a perfect blend of poetry and passion. Ben Whishaw plays the young poet John Keats who falls hard for Fanny Brawne (Abby Cornish), the spirited and talented daughter (she sews beautifully) of a widow (Kerry Fox) who along with two younger children live in Hampstead Village, North London. Keats and his friend and patron Charles Brown (Paul Schneider) take a room in the house where Fanny and her family live, and a slow attraction develops between Brawne and Keats which eventually consumes them in full force. The beauty of it all is that this passion is not so much physical but something that transcends the flesh - this is a couple that due to the conventions of the day (Keats realizes the hopelessness of his situation for his lack of finances makes him an unworthy suitor) where propriety and maintaining a girl's respectability were highly prized makes physical intimacy almost an impossibility.

Despite this, Fanny and Keats are able to show us how very real their affection and love for each other is - they read poetry to each other, finishing each other's lines, exchange soulful looks, the most tender, feather-light kisses, and all these amidst a gorgeous backdrop of lush fields of flowers, butterflies, etc. There is a strong sense of sexual energy - most evident in a bedroom scene where Fanny and Keats, fully attired recite poetry to one another! The one spoke in this relationship is Charles Brown (well-played by Paul Schneider) who resents Fanny's monopoly of Keat's attention, jealous of their intimacy and his inability to break this close bond, though he tries mightily to do so. In a fit of pure malice, Brown says of Fanny, ""She can't speak, because she only knows how to flirt and sew."" To Brown, Fanny is like a pesky gnat, an irritant that won't go away. The jibes shared between Fanny and Brown are actually one of the film's highlights, with an energy of their own, and makes for an interesting contrast to the tender interludes between Fanny and Keats.

As I watched ""Bright Star"", I felt like I was watching the real characters come to life - Whishaw and Cornish breathe so much life into their roles and I was reminded of a line from Keat's poem, ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever."" ""Bright Star"" certainly is a thing of beauty to be treasured and appreciated for a long time to come. The DVD sadly lacks interesting bonus features - trailers for various movies, a deleted scene ""I'll Wait"", and three featurettes which are basically very brief interviews with the director, i.e. ""Becoming Keats and Fanny"", ""Setting the Scene"", and ""An Inspiring Romance"". I wish there had been a director's commentary, a making-of segment, and also interviews with the cast.",1264550400,4,2958,4.764132553606238
4008181,3,B002WY65VA,"I love the movie.  I saw it four times at the theatre because it's so breathtakingly beautiful.  Slow to develop...sweet and unforced in a way that Hollywood has yet to discover.  Jane Campion has created a masterpiece.  I was eager for the DVD release to see the ""extras"" and learn how she developed the film...chose actors...how the actors made choices and worked together...how costumes were researched and sewed...how sets were built and learn about the estates they filmed on.  The DVD, however, was a major disappointment.  For $20 I expected a few decent featurettes about making the movie, but what showed up were three clips totaling about seven minutes of Jane 'chatting' with the camera.  No actor interviews, no ""making of""...nothing of substantial interest.  The DVD that I waited MONTHS for wasn't worth the money.  Rent it, folks.  And wait for the anniversary edition...perhaps it'll have more.",1264377600,9,910,5.129251700680272

4008187,3,B002WY65VA,"Abbie Cornish is lovely in this film - very emotive, and like the backdrop and scenery, gives the film its aesthetic. However, that's the extent of it. While I'm sure the film makers wanted to stay as true to the progression of Keats' life, I felt they could have used the cast of actors better. For e.g., her mother whose role in the film was very present, and surely would have been majorly more vocal than she was. Props goes to Paul Schneider who plays Mr. Brown because he creates a certain tension as Keats friend who sees Cornish's character as a major distraction to Keats work...but the films restraint doesn't allow for further exploration than that. I also liked the actors who played her younger siblings.",1508630400,,717,4.653543307086614

4008258,5,B002WY65VA,"A production like this goes a long way toward restoring my faith in what film as a medium can achieve. As an antidote to the usual bilge the motion picture industry has cranked out in the last decade and a half, I wish there were more films like 2009's Bright Star to balance the scales. As it is, subject matter like the love a young woman and a dying poet once shared intimidates far too many people (um, you, Rob), to the point Bright Star been unjustly shunned by segments of the general public who would likely find it deeply moving.

It is almost inexpressibly touching to see Fanny Brawne and John Keats remembered in a movie that tells their tragic story, and Ben Whishaw and Abbie Cornish more than earned their paychecks in Jane Campion's slow moving but never dull re-telling of a love the world very nearly never knew about at all. (Read up on how Miss Brawne, a worthy figure in her own right, kept her secret for nearly half a century.)

I have not read Andrew Motion's biography upon which this movie is based, and have held off mainly because I care so much about Bright Star that should the source material and film contradict one another,  I don't want to risk the influence that might have on my regard!

Bright Star makes full use of the painful tragedy that separated its main characters in real life, but never strays into the maudlin as it would have been all too easy to do. It's also worth heaping praise onto Campion and Motion for giving us a John Keats who displayed a wide range of feelings, even cheerful humor, freeing us from yet another depiction of him as a sickly, serious-minded, moribund young man, insubstantial as a will o wisp, half in the grave before his heart even stopped beating. (Here lies one whose name was writ in water.) Artistic license aside, this surely is closer to the truth of what these two bright stars shared than anything thats ever previously been filmed.

Its a shame more people today don't read the poetry of the Romantics, particularly John Keats, because their work was the high point of an age that itself represented the English language at its most eloquent. And its also a shame a masterpiece like Bright Star isn't better known than it is.",1433289600,,2210,4.542713567839196

4008297,5,B002WY65VA,"Fanny has a pretty loving family who takes in John Keats as part of the family. Keats is portrayed as a very compassionate man who cares well for his dying brother, Tom. Fanny as well, attending to Tom's and also John's needs through both of their illnesses. taking errands, giving them gifts and being by their bedsides in a mass emotional support.
John and Fanny firt meet in the winter of 1818, she is a teen age girl and he is a early 20 something. Fanny was not into poetry upon meeting Keats but after their first meeting puts her brother Samuel and sister Toots up to buying a book of Keats' poems She reads the book and basks in his words, establishing a strong desire to learn more about Keats.  Keats, in return, studies her and eventually tutors her in poetry. Among hearing her teachers romantic words,  Their love blossoms.
The couple faces the pressure of societal differences, and other try to make it clear to them that John and Fanny can never marry.  Keats' friend Charles Armitage Brown is the most ardent in this, and continues to tell Keats that he will have no freedom as he struggles to provide for what Brown considers to be Fanny's frivolous needs.
In Keats' failing health, he resolves to mercifully sever ties with Fanny...
This is a true period film, and the antique English manners are shown wonderfully through out the movie. we see the deeply in loveness of the couple yet Keats and Fanny refer to each other as Mr. and Miss until almost the very end of their relationship.
It really is over all the perfect blend of romance, civility, and drama. And if you enjoy period pieces the way I do, you have simply got to see it!",1414368000,7,1653,4.503333333333333

4008318,3,B002WY65VA,"The jury is still out on Fanny Brawne, but Jane Campion has made up her mind: here she is steadfast, deeply feeling, aesthetically gifted (the opening shots of the needle and fabric are among the best images in the movie), and in every way worthy of the affection of John Keats.  Keats's friend Charles Armitage Brown warns Keats that she is a distraction, a flirt, and a tease, but that is not what the movie shows.  Brown, for his part, is presented as jealous of his intimacy with Keats and becomes a rival for Keats's attention and affection.  He is portrayed as unpleasant and unprincipled.  So . . . as Jane Campion says in one of the Special Features, the story is a love triangle, with Keats in the middle.

Perhaps a movie requires that kind of conflict, although the evidence for it in Keats's life is shaky -- Keats did worry about what he saw as a kind of air-headed giddiness in Fanny, but the movie doesn't portray her in that way, and in the movie Keats doesn't worry about her in that way.  He only evinces jealousy when he learns that Brown had sent her a Valentine card, but Brown is represented as having done that in jest.  In that moment of jealousy, it's Keats who seems the giddy one.  However, the ""triangle"" idea doesn't really structure the movie, which follows the growing affection of Keats and Fanny at a time of his declining health.  Their affection for one another is touchingly portrayed, and the only conflicts in the later scenes result from Fanny's mother, and her friend Mrs Dilke, worrying about the fact that Fanny is engaging herself to a young man in poor health with no money and no immediate prospects.  She tells Fanny late in the movie that she (Fanny) is becoming an object of gossip -- but really, we never see Fanny behave in a way that is scandalous, so it's not clear why the idea of gossip is even brought up.  All of which is to say that the movie's movement becomes rather undramatic and predictable as it goes on.

The drama that a film can't show is the drama of Keats's intellectual life and growth in 1819-20.  For that story, you have to go to a good biography -- Walter Jackson Bate or Robert Gittings are good.  Here Abbie Cornish is an appealing Fanny, a gifted seamstress at 18, an avid reader, a girl wanting to improve herself.  She's a good sister and daughter, despite the occasional run in with her mother (Kerry Fox), and she's believable as a young woman in love.  The ending, where she walks out in the snow in mourning clothes and shorn hair, and recites the sonnet ""Bright Star,"" is unfortunately hokey.  Her weeping on learning of Keats's death in Rome was movingly done, and would have been a better final impression.  Ben Whishaw is Keats, made up to look like Keats looked in the pencil sketch that Joseph Severn did of Keats on his deathbed.  He's awfully appealing, and the love relationship is sweet, but they're just a couple of kids -- Keats's intellectual force and toughness of mind aren't much in evidence, but that isn't Whishaw's fault.  As Charles Armitage Brown, in Campion's conception of him, Paul Schneider is very good -- the trivial and shallow foil to the substantial and serious Fanny. Finally, the movie looks very good -- the houses (interior and exterior), and the costuming look authentic, and the cinematography is fine.  But as a whole, the film is a bit flat -- it makes the romance, whatever it was in ""real life,"" too ordinary for a movie.",1406505600,,3443,4.556818181818182

This movie didn't do him justice in my opinion. The actor who played Keats did a wonderful job and he was believable. I just wished they would have included more of him reciting his work out loud. I know it was more about his romance (or lack thereof shall I say) with Fanny, but hearing more of his work would have been great. I didn't think the movie truly portrayed a romance between Keats and Fanny, sure they spent time together and they kissed a couple of times, but the chemistry was lacking hugely. It was like they were more childhood friends then lovers of sorts. Which brings me to that self-served, pain in the ass Fanny.  If this was truly how Fanny behaved then I dislike this woman with a passion. She was selfish at every turn, she treated her siblings like SERVANTS and she had nasty disposition with Keats close friend/partner. Her own mother couldn't control her. She basically ruined the movie for me all together. I wish a better version would be made about him or Byron, hopefully by BBC.",1393804800,,1164,4.464788732394366

There is the affair between Keat's friend and the maid, but that's barely touched on.  It makes the film come off as almost self indulgent.  The movie just sobs ""Woe Is Me""  over and over so completely I couldn't help but find myself thinking- Well, get over it already.  Just not my thing I guess.",1389657600,,610,4.654205607476635

4008329,5,B002WY65VA,"This film has much to be admired. The art direction is beautiful and reveals 18th century rural England in a romantic and yet realistic perspective. There are few films that would give the viewer a real glimpse into what life might be like in another century but this film is able to achieve that goal.  The screenplay was superb, it is not so much complex as subtle. The acting was outstanding. Overall this is a highly recommended film. Jane Campions sensitivities to theme, character, and especially the flow of time was very evident. Before electricity and the industrial revolution, families were with each other constantly, working, playing and in each others business.  This film depicts this so well as Fanny Brawne, played by Abbie Cornish, engages in an extended engagement with the romantic poet, John Keats, played perfectly by Ben Whishaw. Cornish plays her role as an independent and intelligent young woman who falls in love with a poor undiscovered literary genius. Whishaw is exceptional in portraying the vulnerability and ambiguities of poverty, ill health, and romantic obsession. John Keats was a Romantic Poet during that period of transition between the Neo-Classical world of the Napoleonic wars to the Romantic period of Wordsworth and Coleridge. Unfortunately, a few years after losing his young brother to tuberculosis he also dies of the disease at age 25.

The film also unfolds the relationship between mentor Charles Armitage Brown, played perfectly by Paul Schneider, and Keats; a relationship that competed with Keats relationship with Fanny.  This creates a tension throughout the film that is finally broken with the death of Keats. Fannys two younger siblings play a role of companions but also co-conspirators in the love affair between Fanny and John Keats. This feature of the film is charming for Jane Campion reveals these children to be both innocent and yet fully aware of the power of human love. It conveys the message that romantic love, with all its power and depth, can be understood by children.

This is a beautiful and moving film. It is a feast for the eye yet a tragedy of lost potential as Keats love and art are cut short by disease. It is highly recommended",1386374400,2,2213,5.002717391304348

And, he fell in love with a brilliant, witty, pretty and incredibly loyal young girl of 18 named Fanny Brawne.

I much prefer Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility which all are thought provoking and inspire you with characters who sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others. In Bright Star, the characters are just out for themselves...to satisfy their own needs. When things get too hard, Keats wants to die, or he won't write or talk to the girl b/c it's too hard for him--no consideration given to how she feels or even that he needs to protect her from contracting tuberculosis. His whole family died from it & he knew the symptoms (even if it hadn't been named yet)...but no, it seemed to be all about him.

Employing Fannie's point-of-view as an introduction to the poetry of John Keats, especially to young people, is brilliant, but exposition is lacking -- anyone not already pretty familiar with Keats, Fannie, Brown, et al will be wondering ""Who ARE these people?  Why are they fussing at each other?  Why should I care?""

Not using the house in which the characters lived, at least for exteriors, is a curious directorial decision never fully explained, and the great potential in Fannie's cute little sister is never realized.

4008360,5,B002WY65VA,"John Keats was the youngest member of the second generation of English Romantic poets. This film arrives just in time for Autumn as in his Ode:
""...to swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells with a sweet kernel...""
Jane Campion has given us, with the combined help of Pathe, BBC and Australia Film, the kernel of Keats in a quiet film of several small superlatives. The focus is not his biography or even his poetry, but on the slow budding of his only romance, that with Fanny Brawne.

I have never heard so much laughter from the audience for a film that is not a comedy. Not belly laughs, but knowing, happy laughter over several subtle moments. You cannot even eat popcorn, so riveted is everybody to this quiet immersion. Gentleman Brown is the brown bear, ranging about, bearing teeth, swiping great paws as foil to the tender side. He is tonic, bitter, but effective.

Never has fabric been so pervasive in a film. The use of cloth and wood in the houses opens to expansive lines of laundry flying on lines. Wind is a great animator here, rather than gunfire or other stupid explosives. Here is the zenith of English romantic poetry, when, as the great physicist, Freeman Dyson says, Science & Poetry Were Friends. Wind billows curtains, so we may feel the air here. This is the most tactile film I have seen. You feel all fabrics, all beds and grass and tree bark. Paper is still important, so you see wet ink at the instance of creation.

And then there is the lighting. Rooms are painted with color that echoes in the clothing. Fields of flowers do likewise. Fabric, paint, wood and leather all are seen as part of nature, not as some desperate rejection. The cloudy English village lets light show us rooms opening to fields and forest. Woods are great trees everywhere without end. Light breaks where no sun shines, said the poet. In the early scenes of English overcast, we might get the feel of Vermeer, but without his focus for symbolism, staging or placement. This film is painterly.
The dank weather of Vermeer is on both sides of the channel. Here, the persistent English clouds hold until that moment when first Keats and Fanny kiss. Then sunlight bathes everything.

Now we have flowers everywhere. Old roses, bulbs and fields of flowers, once again picked up in the fabrics of their clothing. All is air and open windows and sun. Poetry is natural, not an artifice. It is a force of nature. There is Mozart; music abounds as does dance. But it does so adjunctly, as a part of seeing their active, intelligent and muscular lives. There is no real soundtrack. Music is evident, obvious, essential, but not a background drone. We need to hear Keats' poetry against a silent and blooming background.
The flowers everywhere in spring and summer, and lead us to the fabulous butterfly scene. It makes cheap all the zippo crashing hollow special effects we are tired of yet used to, instead of story and voice that we here have.

Finally, we see the bottom of the Spanish Steps in Rome. If you follow the steps, straight past the fountain, down that street, you can have coffee in Keats' daily breakfast place. It is still there, friendly and inviting centuries later.",1350432000,14,3187,4.6637010676156585

4008365,5,B002WY65VA,"I thought this was actually a really excellent movie. I watched it awhile ago and it took me a little while to decide whether I liked it or not. Eventually I decided that I really liked the movie quite a lot, but it took me even longer to figure out why; and now I am going to tell you (this is also my SPOILER ALERT). There are a number of reasons.

The movie was, I think, one of the most emotionally powerful movies I have ever seen. One of the central themes of literary Romanticism (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Keats, Holderlin, etc.) is the theme of infinite longing. The Romantics discovered, or believed they discovered, a longing within the human heart that simply could not be satisfied or find its adequate object within the finite world. This insight, that the world is a veil of tears, lies behind the mood of melancholy that is so prevalent in Romantic poetry. The Romantics did a great job expressing that infinite longing within their poetry and this film does an excellent job expressing it through the medium of film and narrative.

The story is the story of the poet John Keats, who died at the age of 25, and his engagement to Fanny Brawne just before his death. The story is by nature a sad, melancholy story and I was aware of that going in. Sometimes I get annoyed when it is clear to me that movies are manipulating my emotions, usually because moviemakers have become such masters at manipulating emotion. I did not get annoyed with this movie, however, despite the fact that it manipulated my emotions as well as any movie I have ever seen. I think the reason it did not annoy me in this movie is because the emotions felt genuine and real to me. Hollywood seems to have a very difficult time dealing with emotion. They tend to over-dramatize it and that was a very real danger for a movie like this since, 1) it tells the story of first love which is so easy to over-dramatize, and 2) it is telling the story of a Romantic poet and the Romantic poets themselves tended to romanticize (i.e. over-dramatize) their emotions (hence the moniker).

I thought this movie succeeded very well in portraying the reality of first love without turning it into a cliche. It is difficult not to over-dramatize first love because first love does tend to consume the whole world and seem like a much bigger deal when it is happening then it really is, and the moviemaker has to find some way to portray that without believing it themselves (it is when moviemakers believe it themselves that they run into the problem of sentimentality). I thought this movie did a good job of portraying the agonies of first love (Fanny sitting and waiting for letters from Keats when he is away) without turning it into a cliche or indulging in sentimentality.

Now back to my original point. The movie succeeds in portraying the infinite longing that is a theme of so much Romantic poetry by portraying a love that certainly feels infinite to both parties involved while being doomed to be radically finite. John Keats and Fanny Brawne only had around two years together, and they were separated during much of that time. When you are in love there is usually some desire to spend eternity together. The longing for something eternal is partly why the Romantics considered romantic love to be so noble, it seems to aspire to something beyond this world. Unfortunately the world we live in is radically finite and impermanent to its very core. Our days are numbered. Keats and Brawne had less time together than most of us but it is merely a matter of degree.

The climax of the movie comes, in my opinion, when Keats is about to travel to Italy to try to regain his health. Keats is fairly certain that he is dying, and that his death will come sooner rather than later, and it is his last night with Fanny Brawne. Keats says (I am paraphrasing now), ""This will most likely be the last time we see each other on this mortal earth"" and Fanny cries, ""No!"". Keats continues, ""We have woven a web on top of this world but it is now time to start cutting the threads."" At some point Fanny cries, ""There has to be another life beyond this one. We cannot have been made for such suffering!"". That is one of the most powerful lines in the movie and it perfectly expresses the infinite longing that I think is the theme of this movie and of so much Romantic poetry. There must be something beyond this finite world. We cannot have been created just to grieve and to suffer.

That is ultimately the feeling that the movie leaves you with. It is somewhat disconcerting which is why I could not decide right away whether I liked the movie. I was not entirely pleased with where the movie left me. Keats dies, of course, and there is certainly no guarantee within the movie (or within life for that matter) that there is any life or world beyond this one in which the grief portrayed in the movie will be resolved or made good. It was only a week or two later that I realized that is precisely what a great deal of Romantic poetry is attempting to convey, and it was at that point that I decided not only that I really liked the movie, but was able to figure out why.

Finally, I cannot end my review without quickly praising two other aspects of the movie. First, none of the characters were one dimensional. John Keats' friend Charles Brown is a particularly interesting and well played character. Second, cinematically the film is quite beautiful. There are beautiful scenes in fields of flowers and equally beautiful scenes with butterflies playing in the light. It all seems to fit perfectly with the subject matter and the era of Romantic poetry.",1330300800,6,5637,4.547783251231527

I hope you won't mind if I don't go into detail about plot/synopsis because other have said it SO much better than I could; have you read the review here entitled ""Everything""?

For my two cents I'd like to add that as someone that has never paid much attention to costumes in a movie, the costumes in Bright Star are so intricate and astounding it's almost worth it to watch the movie to see them, right down to the very last button.

4008367,4,B002WY65VA,"Through brilliant, stunning visuals and intelligent, witty dialogue, Jane Campion's Bright Star celebrates the rapture of passionate love. Using many of the Romantic John Keats' own words--captured for posterity in his poems and love letters to Fanny Brawne, his 'sweet Girl'--Campion has weaved together one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.

Rich 19th-century fabrics and breathtaking English scenery make Bright Star a sensuous pleasure to experience. But these visuals merely reflect the beauty within, the soul of this film: the love affair of Miss Brawne and Mister Keats.

Brawne is passionate about and proud of her fashionable and daring needlework, as is Keats his aspiring albeit more fine-spun poetry, and both share an ardent love of life and a longing for someone with whom to experience it completely. Theirs is the inspiring true story of the rare uniting of equals--of two strong, independent, and intelligent individuals with unique talents and dreams yet deeply matching values and desires.

The emotional, intellectual, and subtly sensual affair between Brawne and Keats is captured wonderfully in Bright Star, owing in part to the portrayal and backdrop of those closest to the lovers in their own lives, such as Keats' coarse but caring friend Charles Brown and Brawne's warm mother and endearing siblings. The obtrusively vulgar Brown serves in stark contrast to the gentlemanly Keats, whose integrity and will Brown deeply admires but cannot quite live up to in his own life, while Brawne's loving family--woven seamlessly into the storyline through their presence in scenes of playfully benevolent games, strolls, and dinner-parties--serves as foil to the equally loving yet singularly feisty Brawne. Through the meaningful and often tender dialogue and interactions between these vivid characters, Bright Star is able to match beauty of setting with that of soul, a rare feat in a film ... as it is in life.

Now Bright Star has been attacked as sentimental by the modern, cynical skeptic, and if it were the hackneyed story of a princess and a pauper mindlessly frolicking to their ""fairytale"" ending, his criticism might merit a modicum of respect. But Bright Star is not a fairytale in that empty sense; for the fact is Keats died at the age of 25, and he and Brawne were anything but mindless. So unhappily for the cynic his venom is ineffectual against this film; in Bright Star his normally insidious strain of attack finds its antidote: reality. Bright Star is a *true story* depicting the love affair of two exceptional souls who lived a life (however brief for Keats) of happiness *in this world*. In today's angst-ridden, often gloomy atmosphere of humility and despair--where so many either consciously diffuse or unwittingly (and tragically) breathe in the modern liberal claim of man's depravity (itself merely a mutation of the ancient Christian notion of Original Sin)--the little known Bright Star shines through in rebellion with pride and exaltation, demanding its viewers resurrect the self-esteem and aspiration they once had as children, and should never have let die as adults.

Although Bright Star is deeply uplifting and truly benevolent, one must be prepared to leave its resplendent world tinged with a real sadness. But this sadness does not--it cannot--abide if one recalls Keats' own poetic words to Brawne (from an early love letter), which encapsulate the film's essence: passionate love for this wondrous world and one's 'Bright Star' in it...

""...I almost wish we were butterflies and liv'd but three summer days--three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.""",1325116800,5,3687,5.219594594594595

4008376,5,B002WY65VA,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE DVD and BLU RAY VERSIONS ***

""Bright Star"" opens with a close-up of a thread being needled, but the pull and placing of the wool is not methodical nor part of some daily Nineteenth Century drudgery, it's being done carefully - almost as if there's tenderness being sown into each cross-stitch. We then see that the seamstress is a 20-year old lady sat by a window in the early hours of the morning in her bonnet and ribbons - she is Fanny Brawne (played by Abbie Cornish). Her younger sister Toots (Edie Martin) then wakes up in the bed nearby and sighs at Fanny - Toots may only be 6, but she knows exactly who all the 'just so' work is for...

Jane Campion's 2009 re-telling of the mercurial love affair between the struggling English romantic poet John Keats and Fanny Browne has been accused by historians and purists as being historically inaccurate and frankly hogwash. But I feel this is to miss the point. This is a movie - and some artistic allowance is to be expected. But more importantly, Campion absolutely makes it work - and for the whole journey too. You care about these idealistic people - you are enthralled by their short but oh so sweet shot at happiness - and Fanny's destruction at her soulmate's loss is one of the most powerful scenes committed to celluloid in decades.

The setting is Hampstead Village, London in 1818 - and Greig Fraser's Cinematography puts huge amounts of detail on screen. This is a world of Inky Quills, Scullery Maids and Pantaloons - where men smoke cigars, gulp brandy and sing chummy Acapella songs for the gathered Ladies and Gentlemen at society parties. A triple-pleated mushroom collar is a clothing advance and a man who is dying of consumption (Keats' brother) is described as 'diminished'.

Words are all in this society and Campion's script revels in it. Keats' poems ""Endymion"", ""Bright Star"" and ""When I Have Fears That I May Cease To Be"" are all quoted - and the dialogue inbetween is just as elegant and insightful. But of course the movie lives and dies on the dance of love between Cornish and Whishaw - and that courtship and deepening of feeling features so many great moments... a look she gives Keats in the woods as they walk and exchange ideas, her reaction to Tom's death - create something of beauty to remember him by - an embroidered pillow case that she sat up all night making - her feet curling on a bed as she devours one of Keats love letters - her tender kisses on the paper as she posts her reply... It could all have been so terribly corny, but both the actors and the script give it life and a genuine beating heart. Mark Bradshaw's music is also used sparingly and with great effect - and when it isn't there - the silence engenders a terrible feeling of foreboding (sickness, death).

Special mention should also go to Paul Schneider who is exceptional as the arrogant and obsessive Mr. Brown - supposed friend and fellow accomplice in poetry with Keats. Brown does everything to thwart the burgeoning romance between Keats and Brawne - feeling her a distraction from their lofty writing and a danger to his talent - even coveting her as his own. His vehemence forces Keats to step up to the plate and Fanny is well able for him. The core 3 actors here are fabulous together. Special mention should also go to Kerry Fox as Fanny's practical mother and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Liam Neeson's son in ""Love Actually"") as her younger brother Samuel - also quietly superb.

The extras include (a) Working With Jane Campion Documentary (b) Behind The Scenes Featurette (c) Deleted Scenes (d) Photo Gallery and (e) Trailer
The lone subtitle is 'English For The Hearing Impaired'. My only real gripe is that it's not on BLU RAY - a format that would surely make this beauty shine like a diamond (due in 2011 apparently).

Campion and her exceptionally talented cast are to be congratulated - ""Bright Star"" is a literate, sensual, beautifully staged and gushingly romantic tale - and proud of it.

They did a great job and I for one was deeply moved...

PS: the BLU RAY Issue...

As you can see from the photo provided by Amazon (UK) - this appears to be a GERMAN issue on BLU RAY - but the copy I received this morning (Dec 2011) is in fact a FRENCH Pathe issue with that language used for all cover artwork.

There are 2 audio tracks - 'both' FRENCH and ENGLISH DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. It is obviously defaulted to play in French when you start the disc, but a simple flick of the audio button brings in the English version. The extras on the DVD (including the ""Working With..."" making of) are all intact -  but there are also some totally unrelated Australian Black & White shorts tagged on (God knows why).

But the big news is the picture improvement - which at times is simply breathtaking. The outdoor Hampstead scenes, Fanny sowing her garments in her home, Keats lying on top of a tree with its flowering buds beneath him, Fanny walking through a field of bluebells, the child Toots and the cat Topper in her room full of butterflies, the intricate costumes - so many things and scenes are improved - and beautifully so.

A gorgeous film made better by BLU RAY. Seek it out in this form if you've got the player for it. Hopefully it will receive a proper US issue on BR soon...",1309996800,4,5293,4.557894736842106
4008377,5,B002WY65VA,"I don't recall the last time I saw a true romance movie, though I've watched many so-called. So, I almost passed on this one. However, I had read some of this poet's works and was aware of his life story. And I like historical period pieces. So, I gave this movie a chance and watched the DVD. It is easy to become cynical about romance, and to disdain society's often-preposterous version of it. Here is a man who wants to write poetry (and thinks himself a failure at it), and a woman who loves him, nevertheless. It is the story of the relationship between Fanny Brawne and John Keats. It is a true story of a true love, a love beyond lust, desire of a nobler kind, and passion with compassion. For anything less is not love at all, but a pathetic parody. Indeed the poet himself says with fervor (to his cynical friend), ""There is a holiness to the heart's affections. Know you nothing of that?"" The question is well put to us all, especially in today's world, with its violent illusions wherein people often use and abuse one another and know little, if anything, of genuine love -- or even of romance, which is not head games of infatuation, but is rather the sacred Eros of negotiating a covenantal relationship -- respect, honor, commitment. It is this kind of human love that reflects well the Love of Christ for His Church. Naturally, given the setting of the story, the Christian undertone is evident. I would watch this movie again, and I recommend it to everyone. There was a time when language had meaning, love was holy, a poem was a thing of beauty, and romance was a work of art. It can still be so.",1307232000,5,1616,4.444444444444445

Cornish's performance suggests a more controlled and intelligent Fanny than the one that resides in my memory from Keats's letters and the biographies.  Aside from his size, Ben Wishaw isn't at all the way I imagined Keats, though his voice is quite lovely.  A touching and beautiful film in spots...however, I have to say I was disappointed not to have more of Keats.

4008379,2,B002WY65VA,"I am a fan of Jane Campion's work. However, I was greatly disappointed by this film. The chemistry between the two main actors, Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw, was very weak. The way that Fanny Brawne is portrayed makes her seem like a conceited, vain diva who thought mainly of her own emotions. Keats is portrayed as a rather spineless fellow. Frankly, Bright Star's depiction of the romance between Keats and Brawne is so shallow, navel-gazing and overly dramatic that it was akin to watching two teenagers who are at the apex of happiness one moment and in the depths of despair the next.",1305072000,2,591,4.6923076923076925
4008380,5,B002WY65VA,"I loved, loved, LOVED this movie! Similar to The Young Victoria, don't expect anything like a biopic on Keats. Though it's mostly historically accurate, as far as I know, it's a romance above all else. And it is done very well. The whole movie has a very quiet feel- beautiful cinematography that uses a lot of natural light (it reminds me a lot of the 1995 Persuasion in its realistic look), exquisite costumes, and brilliant acting. Even the music, while beautiful, is quiet. There are sensual undertones throughout, but the romance, like the movie itself, is very restrained. The heroine is usually ""chaperoned"" by her younger siblings (her sister, Toots, is beyond adorable!), and the pair cannot marry due to poverty and then Keats' illness. Keats' friend and roommate, the greasy Mr. Brown, also tries to prevent their romance, but this really seems to only encourage them! The ending is tragic (Keats died of consumption at age 25) but the movie is just gorgeous.

The movie is worth watching for the cinematography alone. Everything is understated and subtle, and yet left a bigger impression on me than anything on a grander scale ever has.

By far my favorite thing about this movie was the costumes! It's set in the Regency, which is always a plus (for me at least. I love the fashions from that period). The heroine, Fanny, is a seamstress and prides herself on her fashionable clothes, which she makes all herself. I loved that the clothes in this actually looked hand-stitched. Fanny's gowns in the beginning can be a bit over-the-top (bright colors, big hats and collars) but become more subdued throughout the course of the film. Most of her shoes are really cute too, take notice! Some of Toots' dresses use the same fabrics as Fanny's, which I thought was a nice touch.

This movie is not for everyone. If you like a lot of action and that sort of thing, you'll probably hate it. I may get slightly upset if I hear that anyone hates the costumes, though!",1304294400,,1972,4.743440233236152
4008381,1,B002WY65VA,"I'm sure on the written page this would be a nice love story but on the big screen I found it excruciatingly slower than any art film. The trailer is what hooked me into checking this out and I'm not a English costume drama snob but pick up the pace.

The actors I thought did a decent job and Abbie Cornish is both talented and beyond cute in the role. I just felt the whole thing was let down by the glacial pace of the story. It's a romance where you just wanted to scream at the screen--""Kiss the girl already, will ya!""

Plus for a romance where was the passion? It came across as cold as the landscape of southern England in winter.

I get it's trying to portray a different time period where social mores were different but this was beyond ridiculous. I think it's a total misreading of what actual lives were like back then. I get that the middle classes were chaste but John Keats came from a very working class background and his portrayal in the film I thought was way off-base. Maybe it was the accent or the mannerisms of the actor Ben Wilshaw portraying Keats but it just did not work for me.

The extras on the DVD are decent if you want to know a bit more on the period and the casting. Can't say I went through it all though as I was beyond wasting any more time on this DVD.",1301702400,3,1292,4.156

To open the film is a soundtrack that is both annoying and painful to the ear. Gio might like it; a stringed thing that sounds like forks scraping on a plate. To add to this morose droning are the meagerly appointed sets and backgrounds. The town looks like the old western set from the movie Shane, with fancy lads instead of cattleman and farmers. The interior shots are in rooms that have nothing on the walls but paint. It's like the director rented a conveniently unoccupied house and threw in some old furniture expecting good acting to carry the day. Not! The actors seemed neither comfortable nor plausible in any of the settings. Even the outdoors scenes appear to have been shot in random fields without much thought about the locations. Apparently they couldn't afford a Mexican lawn maintenance team to trim the grass where the socialites were playing soccer. The actors are reasonable given the minimal material they had to work with. They are pretty, handsome, cute, and completely unrealistic. The main character Keats, looks skeletal and diminutive compared to the buxom woman he adores. She could squash him with her big toe or knock him over with her pinky. What she really needs is a, ""Marlboro man"". It's the usual, ""he isn't rich enough to marry his lover"", problem. So we must endure this unlikely relationship with a wink and a nod as the stilted and plodding pace heads toward its predictable conclusion: Keats's death. I thought to myself, I wish this guy would hurry up and die, so he can get published posthumously and finally marry this whiny, spoiled wench. He is a better fit socioeconomically and intimately as a corpse, no doubt. Spoiler alert! My wish came true after the poet artistically rode on the outside of a carriage, without a jacket, in the cold and wet only to conveniently become deathly ill. This death sequence drags on for another 20 minutes as he leaves his love to go to Italy to get better, but eventually dies anyway without his love by his side. Yay! Hey, but this film is about Keats, the famous English poet! The director makes sure to cram a little of his poetry into the script. A boring dinner conversation is livened up with a passage or two and naturally the guests are wholly enthralled and amazed by this little chaps words. If only I could have been as impressed as these actors apparently pretended to be. Spoiler alert: after dinner Keats entertains his hosts with a Scottish jig. This is truly the nadir of this awful romance, unless you have absolutely no interest in any of these characters other than to make fun of them. In which case, it's the funniest part.",1297900800,7,2884,4.768

4008386,5,B002WY65VA,"After watching a few of the 2011 Oscar nominees, I had enough of all these sad mediocrities and I went for something of real beauty. Bright Star, the title of a poem by John Keats, is a film about Keats' love story with Fanny Brawne. He gave her the poem and it just might be about her. Bitter- sweet and sad (Keats died aged 24, and far from her: he had let himself be sent to Italy to cure his consumption.) The film's sounds and sights cured me from the acoustic and visual damages that Social Network had inflicted upon me. Sane Fanny made me forget poor Nina Sayers, the poor swan-chicken.
A great film by Jane Campion. Unfortunately from 2009, so no solution for the current Oscar draught.",1297555200,4,695,4.395348837209302
4008387,5,B002WY65VA,"Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.""

Those are the first lines of John Keats's 'Endymion' and the first bits of his poetry read by Fanny Brawne in this rapturous love story that ends with the poet's death in Rome, in the rooms near the Spanish Steps where even Dixie Belles keep still. Don't worry if you haven't read John Keats since high school, and then perhaps only the shortest of his poems. If this film doesn't send you to your library or local bookshop to confirm your love of language, then you had no business watching it in the first place.

I have to wonder ... how could anybody ever, even a critic, have read a stanza of Keats without recognizing that he was the loveliest natural poet the English language has ever brought forth:

The poetry of earth is never dead:
  When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
  And hide in the cooling trees, a voice will run
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead ...

or

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
  Close bosom friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
  With fruits the vines that round the thatch eves run;
To bend with apples the mossed cottage trees,
  And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
  To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
  With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more later flowers for the bees
Until they think warm days will never cease.

But if you don't like language, you can still thrill to your toenails at the cinematography of this sad film. Once every decade or so, a film is made that recreates the bygone beauty of pre-industrial Earth, a film like the 1991 Tous les Matins du Monde. This is a film that beautiful; it amazes me that the producers could find enough of early 19th C England intact to stage it. But it's not only the sets and sights; it's the pure photography, as perfectly composed in every scene as an Impressionist masterpiece. How could they make a even soggy, muddy trudge through a London slum so touchingly gorgeous?

As my samples should prove, Keats was the sublime poet of the beauties of the seasons. If you think you don't 'understand' poetry, just turn off the sound and watch the seasons change in glory.",1295136000,3,2329,4.484560570071259

Dialogues are well-crafted and so full of subtext it's worth several views. If you want to get a taste of the world of the Romantics, this is surely a film to see. And SEEING is the word here.

I'd probably be happy turning the volume down and just watching this movie because it is so asteticly pleasing.

The people in this movie are beautiful. They are real fleshed out characters who do not act selfishly or rashly, and yet are true to the love they feel for each other. There was deep emotion between the two and that was beautiful.

Why not 5 stars? I can't put my finger on it, but I can say there was something missing. I think there was an element of quickness and disjointedness at times that left me a little confussed. I came to believe that this movie was intended to have a poetic feel, so when theres a random scene with John Keats up in a tree and someone standing in teh curtains I tried to ignor my confussion and let a mood be created, but at times it felt like the mood was being created at the sacrifice of the story. The fact that the scene where Keats gets jealous came out of the blue for me, or the parts relating to Fanny's despart actions when she believes Keats isn't coming back were rushed and brushed over left me wishing for more details and build up or reasons to believe that the same wasn't going to happen again.",1281484800,2,1468,4.315217391304348

This historical significance of a beloved poet, Keats, gives it another aspect which will be enjoyed by yet other following. The romance is just a measure flat, but that has to do more with the attempt to make this story accurate to the life of Keats. Not a fault of the dialogue, and writing. Keats had only a short time to experience love, and his poetry falls short only in quantity of what could have been. Death stole him much too young. Abbie Cornish (""Outriders"",""Candy"",""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"") and Ben Whishaw (""Brideshead Revisited"") make it a believable love affair.

I have not felt this same yearning for the happiness of two frail beings, since, perhaps, my reading of Tess of the D'urbavilles. I have seldom had to pause and rewind so often, to notice the way the wind blew, or the flowers shivered, or the children played, or poetry sounded, or linen danced, or candle-wax spilled, or hands touched, or an emotion flickered across Fanny's face, or an octagon-shaped table with inkwells and quills looked like.

Film provides a look on Keats'love for Fanny Browne who was his muse. Fanny was a source of some of the most beautiful poems from romantic period written by Keats. For people who love poetry and literature this is a must see movie.

Cast in this film is entirely British and they all deliver wonderful performances.  It is wonderful to hear them recite poems.  Film is a sort of period movie that completely imerses viewer into the lives,, desires and hopes of the people of that era.  I loved the shot of Spanish Steps in Rome frm where Keats was taken to the cemetary.  I cannot think of a more beautiful city to die in, but Rome.

4008406,4,B002WY65VA,"I must confess I know next-to-nothing about Mr. Keats, other than knowing he was a poet.  'Bright Star' is a deliberately-paced (perhaps slow to some) almost two hour movie that traces the love affair (as it were) between Keats and Fanny Brawne.  That on-again, off-again relationship was complicated by Keats' rounder of a friend, Mr. Brown.  Brawne and Brown never got along very well, and it was difficult for Keats to manage both of his friends, who so disliked one another.

As in any Jane Campion film, the film looks terrific.  Here England is lusciously photographed by cinematographer Greig Fraser.  Campion was able to make England look just as one would expect of the middle-class in 19th century England.  This is a departure from most English period pieces (though Austen sometimes looks as the non-moneyed classes).  One could imagine walking down the street in 'Bright Star' and actually living there.  (As much as I loved 'Brideshead Revisited', I could not imagine being Sebastian or Charles.  Not in that castle.)

Moderately Highly Recommended.  The film takes its sweet time to develop to its sad conclusion, and that may disappoint some filmgoers.  Others, such as me, enjoyed the journey, the photography, and the acting.  The three leads were great, and the supporting cast was top-notch as well.

Of course, it's spoiled by the annoying, gloomy music that accompanies this entire movie.

So Keats is talented but penniless. He falls in love with the next-door neighbor, the feisty Fanny Brawne. The love affair ends, as it must, both unconsummated and unhappily as Keats dies from consumption aged only 26. We see the characters walking around a lot in the woods, climbing trees and gamboling around in the daffodils and bluebells. There is also the hint of a love triangle because the poet's roommate, Mr. Brown, is almost like a jealous wife, insanely envious of the love growing between Keats and Fanny.

This is a very restrained movie. The acting is pretty good but not much happens and of course we get half an hour of coughing, in fine Hollywood and operatic tradition, before the poet expires, thankfully offscreen.

We don't really get a sense of Keats the genius, of what moved and inspired him. I guess we're supposed to think that Fanny inspired him.

4008414,5,B002WY65VA,"""Bright Star"" tells of the love story between Romantic poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and his neighbor, Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish).  Brawne is a bit younger than Keats and at first doesn't know much about poetry; instead, her ""art"" is designing and sewing her own clothes.  Their affair was largely unknown until after their deaths, when their love letters were published.  The pair were engaged for several years before Keats' death by consumption, and this period corresponds with the writing of some of his most successful poems.  As with many great love stories, this one is about the inability of the two to be together.  For Keats did not have an income and relied on the kindness of fellow writers, including Charles Brown (Paul Schneider), who dislikes the flirtatious Brawne and the attention she takes Keats' writing.

Director Jane Campion has done some amazing period pieces in the past, including the glorious ""The Piano"" (1993).  Unfortunately, she got off-track a bit with ""Holy Smoke!"" (1999) and the dismal ""In the Cut"" (2003).  Thus, ""Bright Star"" marks a stunning return to form and arguably her best film since ""The Piano.""  What I loved most about this movie is how alive it feels; it's not a stodgy period piece that is overly reverential to its subjects.  Keats and Brawne are just two crazy, mixed-up kids in love.  At the same time, the movie doesn't veer too far into syrupy romance, even though one of the protagonists is a poet.  Keats' poetry is featured at times but not enough to scare away poetry-phobes.  Campion really does a lovely job of balancing all aspects of this story, making ""Bright Star"" likely to appeal to fans of Keats' poetry as well as many other types of audiences.

This movie is also one of the most beautiful films set in 1800s England.  The costumes are gorgeous and completely realistic for an upper-middle-class English family.  The scenery and set designs are also stunning without being ostentatious.  Finally, the acting is very good.  American Paul Schnieder (Parks and Recreation) is particularly good as the dour, teasing Brown.  ""Bright Star"" didn't get much attention this awards season; I hope it will be discovered on DVD.",1268697600,3,2189,4.9316939890710385
4008415,1,B002WY65VA,"I wanted to like this movie since I am a huge lover of period romantic dramas. However, this movie left much to be desired. I thought the actors who played Fanny and Keats were flat and dull and I really didn't care about their love story nor did I buy that they were so ""passionately"" in love with each other. I thought the scenes moved far too slowly to the point where I was getting bored and starting to fall asleep. This doesn't happen often since I have been able to sit through 4 and 5 hour long period dramas in one sitting without ever feeling bored. Not only did the acting bother me but I thought most of the hair/makeup and costumes were ugly (how on earth did it get nominated for an Oscar?) and they managed to make Abby Cornish, who I can tell is pretty, very frumpy looking in many scenes. Most of the music was weird, especially the opening scene with the weird singing.

Overall, don't bother with this movie. It is rare that I watch a period romantic drama that I really really didn't like but this is one of them. Unlikeable and unrelatable characters, boring scenes, flat acting and ugly costumes. Stay far away.

Ben Whishaw is lovely as Keats but can do little with the rather monocromatic character written for him.  Hard to believe that Keats could be so hide-bound by convention or so undaring.  The film rather peaks in emotion and intensity after the tragic death of Keats' brother Tom.  The emotion expressed by Fanny through the gift of an embroidered pillowslip, on which Tom will lay his head, is effective and heart-rending.

After that, things just move along episodically with Keats friend sparring with Fanny possessively for Keats' affection, Keats and Fanny never quite making anything happen time after time and, finally, letting others separate them because of Keats' inability to marry due to lack of funds.  Fanny even allows him, at the height of his illness to be boarded at some flea-bitten hostelry in London rather than keep him at home.  And then allows him to go to Italy where he dies.  I found myself becoming increasingly impatient with their lack of tenacity.  Their 'tragedy' pales when it seems they could have done more to be with each other.

These events may well represent what actually happened, but it becomes more difficult to accept the depth or intensity of their love when they do so little to defend and demand their rights to it.",1268179200,,1393,4.939914163090129

4008419,5,B002WY65VA,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from ""Bright Star."" Having seen it at last, I'm impressed by its quiet power, which is equally tender & passionate, truly capturing the essence of finding that one special love of your life. Of course it's all the more poignant & bittersweet for lasting so short a time ... but isn't that the beauty of the cherry blossom, falling & fading so quickly? And for being such chaste love in this case, it beautifully expresses the physicality of the emotions: the tightness in the throat, the quickening of the heart, the exquisite pain of longing & desire. For those who've experienced these feelings, the film will make you relive them all over again!

The look of the film is lovely & fresh, with a certain roughhewn quality to the everyday background of life, and a lushness to the details. I think it very accurately portrays the way first love brings everything into intense focus, making you almost too sensitive to even the most mundane aspects of the world. But then, nothing is mundane when you're in that state -- everything is charged with unbearably piercing meaning, isn't it? The slightest gesture, the most trivial incident: all speak feverish volumes.

The fact that it's a true story makes it even more moving. The bitter irony of Keats' certainty of his failure, without knowing that he was destined to become one of the immortals of poetry, is like a poisoned arrow. But this is really Fanny Brawne's story, told from her perspective -- and Abbie Cornish is excellent in the role. She knows when to be subtle, barely betraying the storm beneath the surface; she knows when to be embarrassingly raw, utterly naked in her anguish.

I felt like I was living in England again (oh how I miss those days). Though there was much sorrow towards the end, the love between Keats and Brawne did not dim in my mind. Their love shined through even in the terrible circumstances surrounding them.  Every scene that Campion portrayed was filled with life, color, expression and beauty.  The actors Wishaw and Cornish were able to evoke the feelings that we imagine were had between Keats and Brawne.  They did a wonderful job in their roles.  Every time they held each other's hands, I was touched.  Every time they'd sneak away to share private moments, I was moved.

""Bright Star"", however, is a marvelous look with a passionate, short, love affair between John Keats, and the young Fanny Browne/Brawne.  Inspired by real life love letters and a period sensitive producer, ""Bright Star"" is a REAl love story.  This is not a modern day romance filled with modern nuances, but rather a timely, reminder that romance is not merely playful interactions before sexual encounters.

The unspoken star of the film is truly the setting.  Like any good western, the scenery creates the atmosphere, while the actors dally within the boundaries. Abbie Cronish oand Ben Whishaw reflect the deeply felt passions well. As a film, it is truly worthy of the Cannes and Toronto film selection process.

As has been noted elsewhere in reviews, I requote the love letter and wish I could write so well.

Unlike that film, however, which consisted of visually pleasing frames with very little action, ""Bright Star"" slowly but surely builds into a climax that will break your heart. The cinematography is beautiful beyond description. It is as if Vermeer came back to life as a photographer.

That Ms. Campion has given us a film about a Nineteenth Century dying poet who falls in love with his next-door neighbor that engages the most jaded of us speaks to her genius as a film director. That she is able to have the actors speak from the poems and letters of Keats to Brawne and make them believable and moving also speaks to her talent. This story in the hands of a lesser director could have sunk into sentimental nothingness, but it does not. You do not have to be a lover of romantic poetry to relate to this movie since it is about a mother who does not want her daughter to marry a poor poet who has no visible means of supporting her and a love affair that because of a mortal illness is destined for tragedy. Surely these themes are as relevant in 2010 as they were in the Nineteenth Century.

4008430,5,B002WY65VA,"For many people, ""Bright Star"" will be a solitary pleasure. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this film who did not already know something about the poet John Keats, even if that something is a shadowy remembrance of a Brit Lit survey in college. If you're contemplating acquiring this film, a quick look at an outline of Keats's biography (there are lots of possibilities online) will bring you up to speed. Even so, a drama set in Regency England that details a delicate love affair---well, let's just say that some people near and dear to me would be fast asleep in under ten minutes.

I loved ""Bright Star."" The focus of the film is Fanny Brawne, Keats's beloved, not Keats himself, and she is beautifully played by Abbie Cornish, who is anything but ethereal, thank goodness. She is warm and rather bosomy in her high-waisted gowns whose fabrics show the imperfect press of the flat iron and the wrinkles of daily living. (There is even a scene in which her mother is shown ironing.) Sometimes the stitches show too, a reminder that sewing was a creative outlet for Fanny, as it was for many women in this period.

The key idea in this film is Keats's love of the sensual, which Fanny comes to share, even though she confesses to not understanding much about poetry. It's no accident that the film maker, Jane Campion, chooses to incorporate lines from  ""Ode to a Nightingale"" from among the famous odes, since any number of scenes in the film are all about yielding to a ""drowsy numbness"" in which ordinary life is suspended and the senses become intensely heightened. Thus, within the domestic, even mundane household interiors of Hampstead interiors, as well as in its fields and parks, butterflies and flowers, birds and music, lush colors and tender kisses, appear and reappear. As Keats tells Fanny when he tries to explain the experience of reading a poem, one does not immediately think of the shore when one jumps in the water; one experiences the water. And so she does, often alone, stretched out on her bed with her eyes shut or dreaming in a corner.

Watching a visually gorgeous film like ""Bright Star"" unfold is a bit like reading an ode by Keats.  At the film's end, one is tolled back to reality and remembers: ""Adieu, the fancy cannot cheat so well/As she is famed to do, deceiving elf.""

The delicately beautiful Aussie actress Abbie Cornish is divine as Fanny, who grows from a self-focused girl to a deeply devoted woman.

Though I understand Keats' friend/agent Brown to be integral part of this film as the third corner in a triangle, he's insufferable. Only finally does he redeem himself, in an interesting confession on his utter neglect of Keats. In several scenes, oddly, Brown destroys the magic between the leads.

The lush cinematography and costume work surpasses one's expectations, the tenderness of the love scenes captivates, as does the fragility of the courting, and ultimately, the final crushing loss. (Cornish is brilliant in her scene reacting to Keats' death.)

4008435,3,B002WY65VA,"I wanted to adore Bright Star, especially after reading some wonderful sounding reviews. I think my expectations where a bit high going into this and I was left feeling a bit underwhelmed and indifferent. Bright Star is a beautiful film filled with wonderful, rich colors, lovely costumes and quiet performances.

Based on actual characters, it is hard to say what was real and what was not. A few points in the film seemed embellished, mostly to do with the actual extent of the relationship between Ben Whishaw's character and Abbie Cornish's character. This being the early 1800's, I found it a tad difficult to believe their relationship was allowed certain liberties, especially with Cornish's mother constantly around and pretty informed of all that went on. Again, who is to say what really happened but it almost seemed unrealistic for that particular time period.

The performaces themselves where subtle, though effective. Ben Whishaw as John Keats was the more understated of the 2 leads and I found his character to be the more indifferent one in the relationship. Cornish as Fanny Brawne was more passionate but again, she seemed almost too 'modern' and forward for the time period. Their budding relationship starts almost suddenly and seemingly out of the blue, or at least that is how I perceived it. I found their connection genuine in some instances and bland the next.

Bright Star is a slow-moving film and a bit confusing in the beginning and may not be for everyone, even those who love Period films, as I do. While I ended up liking it, I can say that I certainly wasn't in love with it by any means. Again, I think I wanted to love it so badly and it didn't meet my expectations, sadly. The ending was very touching and felt very genuine and perhaps, oddly, the best part of the film. There is nothing better than a drama done right and the latter part of the film was certainly proof of that.

Bright Star is an uneven film at times and though not perfect by any means, is still worth watching for those desperately in love with the genre.",1265241600,48,2064,4.7091412742382275
4008436,5,B002WY65VA,"My wife, bless her soul, did something wonderful for me this past week.  Despite her personal regard for this film (she fell asleep in the theater), her knowledge of my personal respect and admiration for John Keats (my favorite poet to ever walk the earth) and my feelings towards this film (one of the top five best of this past year, easy) moved her to buy this movie for me last Tuesday.  She even found herself searching store after store since, for some reason, a lot of places weren't carrying it.

Alas, I've already watched this three times this past week.

Jane Campion is a marvelous director who has stunned me many times, and if you have ever wondered what a Jane Austen adaptation would look like under her sensual guidance, you have your answer in `Bright Star'.  I will say this; this movie is by far one of the most sensually stimulating films I've ever seen.  That isn't to say that it is an explicit film (nothing close to `The Piano') but Campion has a wonderful way of eliciting in the viewer a raw and natural emotion, that of longing and desire, and she paints such a beautifully desirous picture that we are left with baited breath.

The way Keats caresses Fanny's hand; the way she removes a key from her necklace; the way the press their bodies against a wall just to be nearer to one another.  Every frame is captured in such a provocative way that we are so entranced and so, excited.

If you've seen the film, then you may recognize where the title of my review is pulled from.

The film tells of the final years of Keats' life.  Keats' story is tragic because, at the young age of twenty-five he died of tuberculosis.  Sadly, he considered himself a failure, yet today he is renowned as one of the (if not the) best romantic poets who ever lived.  This splendid film follows his relationship with two very important people; his dear friend Charles and his muse (and love) Fanny.  As Keats attempts to make a name for himself, he finds that he is spellbound by Fanny, a self professed artistic soul, and realizes that finding love in her stirred something magical in him (his letters to Fanny are some of the most moving and provoking words ever penned).  Sadly, their relationship was marred by jealousy (on the part of Charles) and social status (he was poor, and thus never wed Fanny) and was eventually cut drastically short by Keats' tragic death.

Campion is a goddess as far as I'm concerned, lacing this film with such glorious emotion and tender affections.

Breaking down this film and trying to explain all that I find so amazing is hard.  To say that this film flows like poetry seems rather clich&eacute;d beings that it is about a poet, but the statement would be a true one.  There is a rich fluidity that exudes every frame and just milks the entire film.  The cinematography is easily the best I've seen all year, with some of the most beautiful screen shots of any film, ever.  I mean, the butterflies, the bluebonnets, the windows, the hands...everything breathes a life of its own, and it is simply stunning (and soul reaching).  You can feel every frame beneath your skin.  The score is simple yet refreshing, and the vocal harmonies add a layer of depth and humanity to the film.  The costumes and sets are outstanding.  I love how one review stated that this film really made you feel as though you were LIVING in that era, and it is so true.  Everything feels authentic, yet it's painted with such lush brushstrokes it appears almost dreamlike.

And then there are the performances.

What can I say really?  I mean, I have been a huge fan of Paul Schneider since his breakout year in 2007 (he just oozes sensual chemistry) and he doesn't disappoint.  Some have attacked his accent, but I found it authentic and unwavering; and his eventual breakdown (""I failed John Keats!"") is so touching and heart-tugging.  Ben Whishaw is a new talent, and an agreeable one.  I do find that this film paints Keats as a canvas for those around him (much like Benjamin Button was last year) and so he comes off a tad less interesting or captivating, but Whishaw has some remarkable moments.  The life of this film is, without doubt, Abbie Cornish.  I was crossing my fingers this morning for a surprise Oscar nomination for her, since outside of Carey Mulligan, she delivers the best performance of the entire year, in any category.  The way she captures the edginess of this woman (her sharp wit, especially when conversing with Charles, is catching) while never discarding her tender affections (the way she describes her adoration of Keats is the pure definition of poetry) is just spellbinding.  There is such natural warmth and progression of character, and that final breakdown (shaky hands, gaping breaths, near seizure-like panic) is so authentic, so powerful and so...unforgettable.

I want to cry.

So, now I have to end this review.  I'm not sure what else I can say outside of SEE THIS MOVIE.  If you are not a fan of the period piece then you probably should avoid it, since this is really a film that defines that genre, but if you are a fan of Jane Austen, Jane Campion (this is her best film since `The Piano') and or poetry then you will fall in love with this film; quite literally.",1265068800,80,5237,4.6073354908306365
4008437,5,B002WY65VA,"In 2009, Jane Campion's ""Bright Star"" returned her to her gothic romance roots (ala, ""The Piano"" and far away from her desultory ""In the Cut"") in telling the story of John Keats, a 19th century British poet who has a passion-driven love affair with Fanny Brawne, the daughter of a family that is renting a summer house next to the one that Keats' shares.  Andrew Morton wrote a biography of Keats, (""Keats"", in 1997) and Campion drew her pas de deux from the biography, casting only the brief love story of the two that shaped much of Keats' famous poetry.  She set the stage to create again, in ""Bright Star"", what she had captured in ""The Piano"", but this time in the type of chaste love so normal to this period.  Keats, at this time, 3 years prior to his death at 25, is an unknown, a hopeful, a dreamer.  If you have read a Keats poem, you are taken away by his sheer romanticism.  Campion reveals its roots in this film.

The film is beautiful.  Campion focuses on her strengths -  the costumes and the incredible cinematography.  The use of wood, of fabrics, of textures, of flowers in the film, is second to none.  There are shots within the film (notably a scene of Fanny Brawne reading one of Keats' letters in a field of blue flowers) that I can truly say took my breath away.

She cast relative unknowns for the leads, Ben Whishaw as Keats and Abbie Cornish as Fanny; they both are independent, intellectual, conscious of how closely they match. Whishaw emanates the love of writing and poetry.  Cornish is equally caught up in her fine needlework, confident in her style.  They bring a vitality to the screen, a rare coupling without any frank sex scenes - they are financially conscious and responsible young people, but yet deliciously vibrant in their feelings for each other.  In the showing I attended of the film, couples who appeared to be lovers or mates waited breathlessly in the tender moments; relating to the subtle moments of wanting between the lovers.  (His hand on her hand, both lovers on opposite sides of a single door...) Both actors are impeccable in their roles; or does Campion just get the best from her players?

For many, this film will move too slowly and the speaking of some of Keats' poetry will seem mawkish.  Only Charles Brown, (Paul Schneider of ""Lars and the Real Girl"") seems practical - his vulgar dislike of Fanny based on what he sees is ""lightweight"" in her love of fashion and tendency to flirt; and Fanny's mother (Kerry Fox, who starred in one of Campion's earlier films) berates her to find someone who has money or an income, instead of a penniless poet, seem to energize the events.  For me, the beauty of Keats' old fashioned poetry, the subtleness of the romance, the utter happiness of the two together, and the heartbreak of Keats' death in Italy; they all contribute to the visual treat that is this movie, a period piece with incredible depth.  It seems as though Campion may be bypassed in the granting of awards this year, but have no doubt, elements of this film are award-worthy.

The DVD has three interesting featurettes and deleted scenes, some of which were more than deserving of being included in the film.  At this point, I don't know if it will be released on Blu-Ray -  as fine a film as any produced in 2009, I hope that ""Bright Star"" (from the Keats poem of the same name) will capture a larger audience on DVD that its limited theater release in the United States allowed.

4008438,5,B002WY65VA,I loved this movie.  I saw the preview for this movie on An Accidental Husband (which is also a good movie) and anticipated it's release.  I had to go to 4 stores before find a copy to buy but it was well worth the effort.  The movie caught me full attention from the begining and I felt like I was in love with Keats myself through out.  The ending is heart breaking but as they say it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.  This film has become one of my new favorties and I look forward to watching it over and over and over!!,1264982400,2,557,3.9375
4008439,4,B002WY65VA,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!  Yes it's quiet, yes it is methodically paced but it is so real, so haunting, so unrequited.  It is a love story, that is all.  A love story of passion and poetry.  It doesn't try to be anything else.  I have it in my dvd player and have watched it a dozen times already.  I do not understand the 1 star reviews for this movie.  Either they believed they were going into a romantic comedy or they are not fans of historical pieces.  John Keats died at 26, alone in Rome.  That should tell us from the beginning that this will not be a happy movie.  But what is magnificent is that in many, many respects, it IS a happy movie.  The love that is created, built slowly and surely is a real thing.  Campion allows Fanny to be infinitely more sympathetic than history would suggest and Abbie Cornish feels a bit like all of us, trying to keep up with John Keats.  Fanny Brawne was no poet, no scholar, indeed would have been forgotten entirely if Keats had not immortalized her with his poetry.  In Bright Star, we see that she is more than aware of all of this, but that she is worthy of it, her own steadfast love makes her worthy of it. It is this, accompanied with Ben Wishaw's exquisite tenderness that make the story so powerful.  It is hard not to believe the actors are mad for each other and Cornish's reaction to Keats' death is one of the most powerful I've ever seen.  There is also an especially poignant scene between Keats and his dying brother Tom, so quiet and so touching, reminding us that Campion is a master. I was grateful they did not make us watch Keats waste away, grateful Campion gave him the dignity he so deserves and that we were allowed to be witness to the golden summer (or should I say ""Autumn"") of his life.",1264982400,25,1760,4.287878787878788
4008440,5,B002WY65VA,"As any true romantic will tell you, there's more genuine passion to be found in a love that goes unrequited than in any happily-ever-after ending a writer could come up with.  Certainly, the Romantic poets understood this - and so, too, does Jane Campion, the acclaimed director of ""Sweetie"" and ""The Piano,"" whose exquisitely understated film ""Bright Star"" has as its subject one of the giants of Romantic poetry, John Keats.

The movie begins in 1818, when Keats, a young and virtually penniless - though already published - writer meets and falls in love with Fanny Brawne, a woman of some means and family background who prides herself on her way with a needle and her willingness to speak her mind in matters of importance in life.  Though monetary concerns and differences in social standing make a match between them a virtual impossibility, the love between the two becomes the defining force of their beings - be they together or apart, in sickness or in health, in life or in death.  Fanny, we are told, became the inspiration for some of Keats' most beloved works - including ""Bright star, would I as steadfast as thou art,"" a sonnet from which the movie takes its title - and they, along with the letters the lovers wrote to one another over the course of their three-year courtship, provide the main primary sources for Campion`s screenplay (a key secondary source is the biography of Keats by Andrew Motion).  And if the story of Keats and Brawne plays like a romantic novel itself, that's undoubtedly part of what drew Campion to the material in the first place.  In terms of emotional power alone, she clearly knew what she had with this story.

Ironically, the most overtly passionate relationship in the film is not the one between the two lovers but the one between Fanny and Charles Armitage Brown, Keats' devoted friend and fellow writer, who jealously guards the poet and his work, and who sees Fanny as a potentially fatal distraction to both the man and his work.  It's hate-at-first-sight for the two of them, with Fanny viewing Brown as little more than a crude, arrogant boor, almost a rival in her love for Keats, and Brown seeing Fanny as a frivolous, flirtatious pseudo-intellectual with nothing of value to contribute to the young genius who seems to have taken such a fancy to her.

Unfortunately, many people may avoid seeing this film, in the mistaken belief that, just because it is a high-toned ""costume drama,"" then it must ipso facto be stuffy, inert and boring.  But fear not, for despite its being set in the genteel world of the 19th Century British countryside, this is no tea-and-crumpets, lace-and-doily affair, but rather a profoundly moving glimpse into the intricacies and complexities of the human heart - one where human passions roil just beneath the surface of the drama and where star-crossed lovers cannot be separated even by death itself.

Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw are heartbreaking as the two ill-fated lovers, while Paul Schneider, as Brown, fulfils his role of carping naysayer without ever overplaying his hand.

The true beauty of ""Bright Star"" lies in how splendidly Campion matches the lyricism of the subject matter with the lyricism of her filmmaking.  With her flawless eye for composition - artfully arranged but never stagy - Campion makes the bucolic setting an integral part of the drama.  The visuals, coupled with a dramatic use of natural sounds and a haunting score by Marc Bradshaw, allow Campion to break free of the bonds of prosaic reality and set the spirits soaring - much as Keats does with his poetry.  I swear, there are times when this movie quite literally takes one's breath away.

""Bright Star"" is a work of art.",1264896000,4,3703,4.8354430379746836
4008441,4,B002WY65VA,"This film has a feel much like that of the better Jane Austen adaptations. There is, of course, its nearly identical setting: Pre-Victorian 19th-century England, with the same tangles of family dynamics, social expectation, and voluminous clothing. It is also beautifully filmed, juxtaposing natural scenery with the sparely furnished interiors of homes rented by highborn classes fallen on hard times yet forced to keep up appearances. More important similarities, however, are reflected in the characters themselves and their various journeys of growth, understanding, and love. Even the one role which might easily have come off as merely adversarial ultimately proves more complex, discovering something of conscience and even a hint of pity.

Unlike Austen's classics, however, this tale is fated to end in heartbreak. Written and directed by Jane Campion, BRIGHT STAR dramatizes the last three years in the life of poet John Keats and speculates on his relationship with Fanny Brawne, for whom he wrote the poem from which the film takes it name. Ben Whishaw and Abbie Cornish in the leads build their characters slowly, so that we are not certain at first whether we will like either of them at all. Yet, with starts and stumbles, they develop a bond of such tenderness that only the hardest heart can fail to embrace their ultimate tragedy and grief. And somehow all this is managed without quite crossing the line into maudlin.

As the film ended and Keats words were heard at length over the closing credits, I found myself wanting to know better the poet's life and work. I suspect Campion herself would count that a success.",1264809600,7,1636,5.078066914498141

8383395,2,B002WY65VA,"Such a long film, with some beauty but so proper and dour (late 1800's), it barely had any life to it. Have often watched 2 hour movies but this one just went on and on. An hour had passed and it felt like 4 hours when I check how long I'd been watching. Finally couldn't finish the last 1/2 hour of it. Keats fine poetry notwithstanding and Abbie Cornish being a fine actress whom I enjoy but just was hard to watch her so cloistered in this film even though she was the only one who gave it spark and carried the interest in the film at all (though the little girl sister was very cute and enjoyed her as well). The countryside and scenery was lovely as were many of the sets. Just not my 'cup of tea' ..., the boring restrictions and proprieties of the late 1800 England. Although I just greatly enjoyed Judy Dench in a film about Queen Victoria so I guess it depends on the script and the film itself. Somehow this film just wore me out and basically I wish I would have turned it off sooner.",1526428800,,996,4.16580310880829
