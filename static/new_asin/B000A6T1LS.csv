2374007,5,B000A6T1LS,I think this is THE best dvd that Denise has made.  I love each segment and the fact that they're 10 minutes.  It's nice that she gave you the option of listening to her along w/music or just the music.  The pilates challenge is great.  I think the program that she has developed is a nice way of taking the regular pilates routines (on dvd) to the next level.  Also wonderful background/scenery!,1127952000,16,396,4.444444444444445
2374008,5,B000A6T1LS,"I've worked out to Denise Austin videos since 1997, and I really enjoy this disk more than any of her other exercise routines.  I'm new to Pilates, so this disk challenges me still.  What I really appreciate on this disk is the ability to create your own workout line-up.  I was able to pick the spots I wanted to focus on and work through them in my own order.  I hope future Denise disks move in that direction!",1127606400,8,413,4.256410256410256
2374009,3,B000A6T1LS,"This was a very nice production as far as the set, music, and variety of pilates exercises. However, IMO Denise Austin is a very poor instructor. She does not count so you know how many of each exercise you're doing, the flow was strange to me (for example, you'd be on your back doing ab exercises, then switch to your side, then on your back again)so there was a great deal of changing positions. Also, Denise often wouldn't tell you the name of the exercise you were doing until you had completed several reps. I prefer a more flowing routine like those taught in the Crunch Pilates series with Ellen Barrett, the 10 Minute Solution Pilates dvd with Lara Hudson, or any of the pilates workouts by Michelle Dozois. I guess I've realized I'm just not a fan of how Denise teaches, and will stick to Ellen Barrett, Lara Hudson, and Michelle Dozois for pilates. Good thing I got this from the library to preview rather than buying it!",1127606400,28,932,4.520710059171598
2374010,4,B000A6T1LS,"This is a better workout dvd than others she has done.  It's actually well cued (for a change).  There are three full ab routines and a hips, butt, thighs and full body series.  You can watch these in any sequence.  There is matwork and standing exercises and she's as bubbly as usuall  (if not overly so).  This has already produced some results with me and so I recommend this highly.",1127260800,21,386,4.442857142857143

I loved that she used to film in different places around the world, give advise about eating and living healthy, and each day of the week focused on a different area to work on.",1466208000,,290,4.0701754385964914

2374060,5,B000A6T1LS,"I normally am a yoga and Kundalini yoga gal but lately I've discovered Pilates.  I like how in Pilates you feel good so quick, it's not stagnant and the moves tend to be streamlined and flowing.  So I decided to get this older DVD. I am so glad I did!  Denise really knows how to work the body. And she does it with exercises that are, for the most part at least with me, a pleasure to do.  When I first viewed this video I was kind of ""meh"" in that it didn't look very fun to do. But I was wrong.  The exercises feel very very good. I start getting into this bliss and I want to continue on.  The toning effects are wonderful, too. I exercise mostly for body/mind but I can tell, her Pilates videos really tone. Do it regularly you will have made a phenomenal difference in your body. I like how you can pick and choose what to do.  Often I want to do something more cardio and then return to this for toning (all of the toning sets I tried were fun to do).  Oh, the scenery is really beautiful which is always a nice plus. Thank you  Denise for all your wonderful videos.  They have enabled me to be healthier and happier.",1447804800,,1124,4.091324200913242

2374080,5,B000A6T1LS,"Another great video by Denise Austin. I like being able to work out only 10 minutes, or add several together and make it a longer day. The routines are easy to follow and really work the intended parts!",1424131200,,202,4.342105263157895

2374094,4,B000A6T1LS,A good workout video if you dont' like going to the gym.,1415232000,,56,3.75
2374095,4,B000A6T1LS,"This is the hardest workout video by far that I have ever done by Denise Austin. I am more intermediaries, but this vidro is for advance users. I never thought Pilates could be so difficult, but it is. I tried all 7 of the 10 minute workouts and have decided to concentrate on the first three:  the core, abs, and power abs. The Pilates challenge is easy enough, but the other 6 definitely work you up into a sweat.
  I had to reverse the order of the first three, because, by the time I got to Power Abs,  my energy was almost depleted. I do the Power Abs first, then the core, followed by the abs. The rollover is extremely difficult, and it will be another month or so before I can actually perform the move.

  Overall, I love the DVD. I perform the first three exercises roughly three times a week. The core is easy enough, but my core needs strengthening to perform the rollover, so, for now, I will concentrate on these three exercises.

The exercises for hips, thighs, and buttocks are also difficult, but that is okay. This DVD challenges me to move to the next level, which I like. Overall, I enjoy this DVD by Denisr because the moves are more difficult. These exercises are not for beginners, but geared towards those who are already familiar with  Pilates.",1412640000,7,1269,4.435344827586207
2374096,5,B000A6T1LS,"I really enjoy this.  She goes a little too fast but, other than that...this is a good workout.  It's relaxing.",1409788800,,111,4.5
2374097,4,B000A6T1LS,I enjoyed doing this after my walk. Good pilates routine for someone who wants to feel stronger but not go crazy with exercising. (mid level workout),1406160000,,149,4.769230769230769
2374098,4,B000A6T1LS,Love the tropical backdrop for the workout. It makes it all more pleasant to complete. Used to get her shows on TV. With this DVD you can pick and choose from a variety of 10 minute sequences,1401321600,,191,4.1891891891891895

2374141,4,B000A6T1LS,"Bought Denise Austin's work DVD and so far so good.  Her enthusiasm helps me to finish her 10 minute workout segments, which I like.  If you want to firm up without going insane, this is a good purchase.",1391385600,,203,4.315789473684211

2374143,4,B000A6T1LS,"Though this is not her newest, I love this dvd. You can customize your own workout - each pilates segment is 10 minutes long. They range from the easier side to more advanced as well, so you can work your way up.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because on a few of the segments her cues are off. In addition she dosen't fully explain some of the moves, even does one or two of them differently then she instructs you to do them. I figured a few things out for myself and I still really like it - regardless! Enjoy and God bless :)",1390176000,2,546,4.009174311926605
2374144,5,B000A6T1LS,I've owned this dvd since I was in High school about the age of 17. I started to see a tremendous change in my body and let me tell you I had membership to a contract gym. Money wasted and for what to get lean from home? Worse mistake was doing the gym. Pilates uses your own body weight to build muscle and keep loosing calories even after your done exercising. Sure you can add in some additional weights and follow other programs but let me tell you this dvd really works!! If you want to sweat and feel the soreness of your body being changed...get this you will see amazing changes in your body. Absolutely love it!!,1389398400,3,621,4.271186440677966
2374145,5,B000A6T1LS,"I love all of her DVDs! Some of this can be challenging but it's a great accomplishment when I know I did it!

2374147,1,B000A6T1LS,"Hated it, but probably because I am just too old to wind my body around the way I need to with the pilates.  Too fast and too and hard to follow.",1378684800,,145,3.6774193548387095
2374148,4,B000A6T1LS,"Great workouts, but she moves too fast through the exercises. Pilates is supposed to be about focusing on breath and control, but these videos just blaze right on through",1373414400,2,170,4.896551724137931
2374149,5,B000A6T1LS,"I really love the way you can just do a ten minute workout or combine everything together for a full 75 minutes.  Each ten minute section focuses on a different portion of the body, from a strictly core workout to abs & waistline to hips, thighs, buns.  The ""pilates challenge"" is 15 minutes and I use this section as my warm-up.  The other six sections are 10 minutes each and I focus on just the ones I want to use on that particular day.  Great DVD!",1372723200,,452,4.22093023255814
2374150,4,B000A6T1LS,I like these workouts because they allow you to workout as much or as little as time dictates. You can target problem areas or do them together for a comprehensive pilates workout. I supplement my runs with these to tone and improve my flexibility.,1372118400,,248,4.659090909090909

2374172,5,B000A6T1LS,This is a great workout. Denise is precious and teaches so well as always! I use this daily. Highly recommended.,1366156800,,112,4.65
2374173,5,B000A6T1LS,I love this video.  I kept on checking it out of the library so decided to buy it.  They are shorter workouts that you can customize to play together to make a longer one.  I do pilates and am a runner too and I feel the burn the next day.  Short enough to do while the kids are awake too.  I figure they can entertain themselves for 10 minutes...or at least entertain themselves by making fun of me doing this.,1365724800,,411,4.0875
2374174,3,B000A6T1LS,"I like the option of picking and choosing your own work out. You can choose to work out your abs, thighs, etc. Or just do one at a time. It is definitely not for beginners, though. I'm trying to get in shape, not so much lose weight, but be toned. It was hard to stick with this because of the difficulty level. Also, Denise Austin's voice can be irritating, she never stops talking throughout the ENTIRE workout. Luckily, there's an option to shut off the talking and just have the music playing.",1365638400,,497,4.413043478260869

2374178,1,B000A6T1LS,"I've done quite a bit of pilates via classes and dvds.  Out of all my experiences, this was the WORST.  While I'm not the greatest pilates practitioner, I do know that doing one more for a couple of seconds and then going into the next movement is not the right idea.  She doesn't promote good breathing OR posture (VERY important elements in pilates).  I only bought 1 episode and I'm glad I didn't.  Save your money.  Want a good workout?  Check out Ana Caban or Suzanne Bowen.  You won't be disappointed with them.",1359072000,,517,4.483870967741935
2374179,4,B000A6T1LS,I really like that you can pick and choose these workouts for what you want to workout in the time that you have.  I really felt the burn plus there isn't too much repetition in moves if you do all of the workouts.  I do find Denis Austin a tad annoying-personal preference-but she moves quick and doesn't waste time.  I really like that these are available to stream to me anytime on my computer or kindle!,1353974400,,407,4.328947368421052

2374212,5,B000A6T1LS,You'll certainly feel the effects no matter which segment you choose. The abs segments are particularly challenging in my opinion. It's worth adding to your Denise Austin collection!,1311897600,,182,5.535714285714286
2374213,5,B000A6T1LS,"I absolutely love this DVD! The exercises are great, but the best part is she has split the exercises in segments about 10 minutes long each based on which part of the body you want to work on. You can mix and match whichever you feel like doing for the day, or just do one segment if you don't have much time. A lot of the reviews say she is annoying, which yes, is true. Her voice is a little annoying and very upbeat, but I actually like it, especially when she says ""Let me see your smiling face!!"" I wouldn't be skeptical about this though, because there is an option to do your exercises ""without Denise"". You can turn her voice off if you find it too annoying. This is my favorite DVD I have found to work out to and I highly recommend it!",1299283200,,746,4.116438356164384
2374214,3,B000A6T1LS,"My opinion on this dvd based on my experience, is I don't think that Denise Austin is a good instructor at least on this particular workout. It seemed as if she was thinking of things to do as she went along. Her cues were off, she would move on to another position without saying so or she would say last one and it wasn't the last. If you take your eyes off the television you will be lost because her direction was less than impressive. I love pilates which is why I ordered this workout, but If you are new to pilates you might not want to start with this. The workout is affective though if you do it and stick with it you will see results. She knows what she is doing her body is incredible I just have issues with her instructions.",1297814400,,738,4.131944444444445
2374215,2,B000A6T1LS,"I got this DVD because I really like DVDs that have lots of short segments you can mix and match. I usually get 10 minute solution DVDs which I love. This one sounded similar so I thought I'd try it.
I tried it once and it's unlikely I will use this DVD again. Denise Austin is soooo annoying! She talks NON STOP, and uses the most sickening cutesy terms. Also she only does maybe four reps at most of most of the excercises so it doesn't seem very effective. I didn't feel anything the next day at all. The excercises themselves did not challenge my body at all, however they still seemed way too complicated. I also didn't like the way a lot of the moves were quite 'dancey'. This DVD is ok for beginners, as long as you can stand the constant annoying talking of Denise. Personally, if I never hear the words 'zip up your abs!' again, I will be happy. I'm going back to 10 minute solution.",1289952000,,892,4.252941176470588
2374216,2,B000A6T1LS,I ordered this DVD along with another pilates dvd by Brooke Siler.  I did not enjoy the way Denise Austin instructs and teaches the exercises.  I felt she moved too fast and some of the exercises were not very safe for someone who has had a history of back issues.  She goes too fast.  After two years I just do not use this DVD.  I do not recommend this one.,1280361600,,359,4.071428571428571
2374217,3,B000A6T1LS,"This was my first experience with Denise. I was fully prepared for her chatty and frilly encouragement, but I still found it hard to finish any of these segments without becoming too annoyed. I do think the idea of this workout DVD is great! And the exercises really do ""hit the spot"". I would recommend this video for someone more familiar with traditional pilates, as Denise runs through the movements pretty quickly with little focus on form or breathing. I didn't really get much of a workout with this video, but it definitely would be beneficial for a pilates novice to move up to and advance their skills and workout.",1279756800,,624,4.681818181818182

This video is perfect for me to get a work out in and customize it to my schedule. There are 7 options of workouts to mix and match and customize what body part you want to focus on. Even on my laziest day I can convince myself to do 10 minutes(which usually turns into 20 minutes or more because it is so reenergizing). People have mentioned that it's too easy, but with time constraints, I think it's a perfect weekday workout when you get home from work late or wake up a little earlier, but don't have the energy to go for a run. This way you still get a workout in, focusing on the body part you want, and still be able to feel sore the next day.",1274054400,2,785,4.006369426751593

2374254,3,B000A6T1LS,I have 3 of Denise Austin's Pilate's DVD's this one is my least favorite. The main reason I dislike it is there is no stretch segment or stretching in the beginning of each work out. I guess if you don't mind stretching on your own before you do the work out it would be okay. The other reason I disliked it was that the movements aren't always fluid moving from one smoothly to the next. Other then that there are some good moves and the DVDs are okay. The Denise Austin video I prefer the most is the Daily Dozen it has a 12 stretching segment (I like to do everyday) and then 2 body sculpting segments with handweights and 2 cardio workouts. I really like the body sculpting and have seen results from it!,1264550400,,708,4.2518518518518515
2374255,5,B000A6T1LS,"I love that with this dvd you can CUSTOMIZE your workout.

I've customized mine as follows:

I do the 15 minute Pilates Challenge TWICE for a total workout time of 30 minutes.  I've also started using 2 lb. hand weights whilst doing the workout.  I felt like my arms weren't being worked enough so I've modified Denise's excercises (just a little) to add more arms, because that is one of my problem areas.  The Pilates Challenge segment works the legs just fine.  I've already started to notice more leg muscle after just 1 1/2 weeks of doing this.  Although, I am thinking of buying some ankle weights to try using along with it also.  Alternating the ankle weights and the hand weights.  Never doing both at the same time, of course.
  I'm 33, and have noticed that I have lost ALOT of muscle in the past couple years.  And my body has just changed dramatically from what it was in my late twenties.  So, I decided that I want to change that sooner rather than later.
  I really feel like I am getting an INCREDIBLE workout for the amount of time that I am spending working out.  I feel like I've REALLY accomplished something after the 30 minutes.  I never felt that with walking or things like that.  I'm building muscle and endurance at the same time.  It's so exciting to see my legs toning back up instead of being flabby.  I can't wait till I start noticing a difference in my arms which should be soon!!",1264032000,3,1413,4.424124513618677

They are 10 minute segments, and doing these 2 segments together several times a week whipped me back into bikini shape quickly. MUCH more effective than crunches.

I want to challenge my core.  This is broken up into a few short workouts, and a bonus challenge; it can always be done in it's entirety.  I have days when I want to use the whole DVD for my day's workout; there are days, however, when I want to use one segment for part of my day's workout.

Denise's cues are as always great.  However, she, her voice rather, can grate on one's nerves.  I like Denise, though, because she emphasizes certain important factors in her workouts.

The setting is beautiful, and as always, Denise looks great, (and asks for a smile:-).  The music is nice.

Part of the time, she is cuing another partner on the set, and other times she is by herself.  I found this a bit quirky. Her outfits are so cute, and she has a different one for each segment.

The segments progressively get more difficult, so one can adjust.  I can't do the ""teaser?"" (""V"" position) very well. However, she makes it easier by having you get you to recline first and ease into it.  This is a very important Pilates move.  Very deep into core muscles.

What's great about Denise Austin's ""Hit The Spot Pilates"" is that you can customize your workout program in the comfort of your home and you don't need any extra equipment.  Whether you are just getting started with Pilates or consider yourself an expert, Denise Austin's ""Hit The Spot Pilates"" is a very effective home Pilates exercise routine.  The DVD is divided into two segments: 1) The Abs and Waist Line, which consists of three 10 minute work out routines. These techniques will help you define your abs, trim your waist and improve your posture.  2)The Lower Body: Hips, Thighs and Buttocks, which includes three 10 minute workouts, each zeroing in on each body section.

Denise is a very articulate and vivacious; her bubbly personality and enthusiasm keeps you motivated.  I've gotten great results in a very short time and I highly recommend this DVD.",1217462400,,1014,4.894736842105263

What I like about this DVD is that there are targeted exercise routines based on the body part you want to work on that day. So you can piece together several 10 minutes workouts to do as much or as little as you feel like doing. After doing 20 minutes, I have worked up a sweat and after 30 minutes I am feeling like I had a pretty decent workout. I wish she'd provide more instruction with some of the complicated exercises or that there would be a person to show the 'beginner' version of some of the moves.

She seems fairly quirky and sometimes the stuff she says not only motivates me, but also makes me laugh.  It's so much better than working out to a stone-faced trainer.

I'm by no means a beginner, but this dvd will make you sweat because Denise utilizes some positions that are pretty challenging.  I also like how each workout is specifically focused on one area...such as thighs.  It's better than other workout dvds that offer one 10 minute segment to thighs, buns, and hips all in one.

The one complaint I have is that Denise doesn't spend very much time on telling you how to position yourself while doing exercises.  For example, she doesn't tell you how your back or neck should be aligned.  I think that would have been more helpful.  Otherwise, I love this dvd!

I am not overly coordinated but I do have a lot of strength. I like this DVD because I can break it down into segments as I am doing housework, and then I can actually help my body. For me the routines are tough- I can still only do the beginner type stuff- but as you get used to it you start to see how you can do easier versions of things to help you get strong enough to get to the next level.
At first her personality can be a little offputting, but when after 20 minutes of this DVD and I have sore muscles the next day, it's worth it to me.

Either I can take my time and do it correctly, or I can be sloppy to keep up with Denise and possibly hurt myself. Also, many of the poses appear to be intermediate or advanced level, and I haven't gotten that far yet in my beginners Pilates. I don't feel comfortable taking instruction from Denise in how to do those, because I don't want to learn to do them wrong. Also, she does the hundred, the basic beginner move, differently than I learned, and I'm wondering how much she modifies the other poses.

This may be a good video for intermediate/advanced people who are looking for something a little different. I will probably appreciate it more when I get to that level. Or maybe not. I'm wondering how much of the instruction is truly Pilates, and how much is just toning with a Pilates flavor.

I really like Denise's instruction for my cardio exercises, and I think that her talents are better suited for faster paced workouts than for something that requires patience and precision.",1189123200,12,1142,4.5931372549019605

The first time I worked out to the DVD I thought some of her moves weren't that challenging but then my husband pointed out I was doing them incorrectly. When I did them the right way they were much harder. I really like that you can choose to listen to her explanation or just the music. After listening to her once or twice you'll probably get tired of her voice. She is encouraging though.

Denise Austin herself can be a touch painful to listen to over and over again but there are options where you can mute her! So, presumably she realises that she sounds painful herself! Overall, I would really recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to pursue Pilates at home on their own schedule. I wouldn't say that this is a DVD for absolute beginners since some of the exercises are quite tough and since it is fast moving it may be hard to really get the benefit if you are the whole time trying to work out which leg goes where.",1179273600,5,877,4.1345029239766085

2374410,3,B000A6T1LS,"These are seven 10-minute workouts that target ""trouble areas""- waist, abs, thighs, hips, etc. You can do them all or you can select as many as you'd like. Each workout includes many movements taken directly from the traditional Pilates exercises, as well as some yoga movements and others that are a combination of both, or where you target different muscles at the same time.  While the workouts are short and varied, and provide a welcome twist to the routine that can set in on regular Pilates mat exercisers, I got annoyed by Denise's overly protective, motherly style which distracted me from fully focusing on each exercise.

The workout includes 3 different sets which target the abdominal area, waist and laterals. Surprisingly no hundreds. (Hello, isn't that the most important Pilates exercise?).  She includes the 'stomach series', boat pose, lots of T stands and variations of it, one legged downward dog pushing to one legged plank, side stretches, lots of side twists as well.

There are then 3 segments of 10 minutes each, targeting the hips, buns and thighs respectively. She covers practically every exercise included in the side leg mat series (if you are familiar with Pilates), T stands again, lots of inner and outer thigh work, as well as a standing Pilates series and lunges. A nice burner overall.

My complaints about this video:

1. While Denise sure knows her stuff and displays good form, she did make me wonder, is this a Pilates video or did I just pay to hear Denise's nonstop blabbing while she does Pilates at breakneck speed? I don't need to be reminded that ""this exercise works the waist"". I think I can get an idea of which area these exercises target once I do them, or at least she doesn't need to mention it 10 times.  Or she often tells you how this exercise is her favorite (they all are!), or ""how challenging this exercise is!"".  Is she trying to motivate you?  I don't know. It takes away your attention from the exercise.

2.  The workout is too fast with very few repetitions of each exercise. Yes, intermediate Pilates is faster, however, she could have added few exercises with more precision. She repeats some exercises in a couple of segments, which she could have avoided by adding more repetitions to each exercise.

To summarize:

If you are a beginner in Pilates:

There are other quality videos you could try before venturing to this one. I would recommend getting a Stott Pilates video before progressing to this one, which offer superb instruction. Denise makes occasional remarks about form but she moves too quickly from one exercise to the next so you may be better off with a Stott Pilates beginner's video or one of the Gaiam beginner's ones, that way you can learn proper form and breathing and then progress to this one.

If you have some Pilates experience:

Again, this will be a fun twist to your mat routine. You could add one lb ankle weights to the hip and thigh sections to add challenge. I do need to mention that there is music only option. You can listen to Denise the first time to get familiar with the routine and then try it with music only.

There are other great DVDs that present short sequences (10 to 15 min each) and with much more pleasant instructors. Check out 10 minute solution Rapid Results Pilates with Lara Hudson or The Method Target Specifics Plus.  Both are greatly recommended.

I am also new to pilates except for another, much slower-paced Kathy Smith video (which has great pointers). So this is exactly what I wanted--a long workout (up to 60 minutes) that I can customize with a new set of exercises.

Now I know that I have yet another video in my arsenal that will actually work my core continuously, while also targeting my legs.

I could never imagine working out at home while watching an instructional video! But my husband had been working out using one of Denise's videos and he was thrilled with the results. That encouraged me to try out as well. And I can already feel the results myself!! And I also have my energy levels up. I do not agree that she talks too much.

There are 3 different 10 minute abdominal/core sequences that go from easiest to most difficult and allow you to progress as you become stronger.

Her exercises are fantastic & are helping me get into shape after having a baby (I'm now 30 so she still looks pretty good for her age!). Only problem with this DVD is it assumes you won't want to do all the segments. I wanted to work 30 mins on my stomach to flatten it post pregnancy + hips, thighs, bum & cardio challenge. Every time I do the workout I have to select all 7 segments as there's no option to PLAY ALL. I still like her style as she's very encouraging & challenges you to go further each time so you can watch it over again and not get irritated like with some other instructors. 'Loose an inch!' However, I would like a more advanced workout from her as after 3 months I'm finding it easy.",1169164800,6,830,4.098159509202454
2374470,4,B000A6T1LS,"This is one of the most-well produced and visually stunning exercise videos I have ever seen. A lot of money and effort obviously went into the making of this video. The production is stellar. I love the caribbean theme and music, the various colorful and beautifully detailed, decorative tropical sets. A couple of routines show Denise exercising by a pool with an ocean backdrop that looks very realistic - you even see a ship far off in the distance in one of them. So with just all of those elements alone, you certainly won't get bored!

As for the workout itself, this video is very practical as it is divided into seven targeted segments - three for the abs and waistline that get progressively harder, one each for the hips, thighs and buttocks, and a final standing pilates challenge that is very ballet-inspired. I usually combine one of the ab and lower-body part segments, as a 20-minute stretch and tone routine after my aerobic workouts on cardio days.

I only have one major qualm with this video. I bought it because I wanted a workout that only targeted my abs, buttocks and thighs, but would differ from my usual total-body weight-training workouts, and that I could alternate it with. The problem is that I have naturally weak arms and I have to rest them as much as possible every other day, so that they completely heal and regain all of their strength again to exercise them with my weighted workouts. However, several of the exercises in this video actively engage the arms (like the Pilates side stands) to support the body when peforming exercises that are suppose to target the abs and lower body parts - and quite frankly, I feel much more challenged in my arms during these workouts than anywhere else - obviously not my goal. So I'm forced to omit these particular exercises altogether as they cause outright pain in my arms if I've used weights the day before, which is quite frustrating. The core and lower body exercise are moderately effective, but as usual with Pilates, there are a low number of repetitions as the exercises flow from one transition to another (and as these are 10-minute segments, Denise does seem to cram a lot of exercises into a short period of time.) So I'm unable to substitute my strength training days with something like this, as it would not be enduring or challenging enough on its own.

Other than that, this is a wonderful video and I highly enjoy many of the exercises. I find that Pilates is best for overall stretching, some toning, and gaining more active flexibility. Overall, I definitely recommend this, especially to anyone who already enjoys doing Pilates.

Here's another added bonus. After the video takes you through the introduction and to the main menu, there is the repeated sound of ocean waves crashing against the shore and distant seagulls. It's a fairly long loop. The sound is so relaxing and transportive that I've often turned off the TV screen at night and left it playing at low volume through the stereo speakers and drifted off to sleep to it.

2374496,5,B000A6T1LS,"Joseph Pilates, a German-born nurse, developed the workout known simply as ""Pilates"" in the early 1900s. The principles of Pilates emphasize total body conditioning exercises that improve strength, endurance, flexibility, mental concentration, and posture. The traditional method combines both matwork and equipment exercises. This DVD focuses on matwork and adheres to proper Pilates principles. You should use a yoga mat and do the exercises in bare feet.

This DVD offers a completely customizable workout; each section is ten minutes long. Sessions include ""the core,"" abs and waistline, power abs, hips, thighs, and buns, plus a bonus segment called ""power Pilates."" Each session includes stretches for warming up and cooling down. All sections will strengthen your ""core."" These core muscles provide a central foundation for all other muscle groups and lie deep within the torso. Training the muscles of the core corrects postural imbalances that can lead to injuries such as lower back pain. The biggest benefit of core training is to develop fitness that is essential to both daily living and regular activities.

Instead of performing many repetitions of each exercise, Denise Austin adheres to Pilates guidelines, using fewer, more precise movements, that require control and form. In addition, each session also adds isometric components, a form of resistance exercise in which one's muscles are used in opposition with other muscle groups to increase strength without using free weights. The exercises also emphasize proper posture, stability, and breathing. This dvd does not provide high-powered cardiovascular exercise, but you will sweat and you will feel yourself becoming more limber and strong.

Denise Austin has a great, encouraging tone and an engaging manner. She helps keep you motivated but is not overly perky. She is in such amazing shape that it is hard to believe she is nearly fifty years old. She performs all the exercises in lovely, tranquil outdoor settings. The music is pleasant and enhances the workouts.

I have seen very rapid results using this dvd. It is especially effective for toning women's common trouble spots. It has become my only workout tape because it doesn't bore me, it is highly effective, and--dare I say it--it's actually enjoyable! If you use this regularly along with a good diet you will soon develop long, lithe, and lean muscles.",1163462400,17,2391,5.334217506631299

an option for creating your own program, which is probably

the best way to do it.

Denise does her usual excellent job of giving precise,

In one section, she doesn't do the workouts but only instructs one lady who's doing it, while in another section, she's all by herself doing the work.  She also gives pointers on things to do and to avoid.  Personally, I do all the 3 ab workouts since this is my problem area, while doing away the lower body workouts if I don't have time.  During weekends and I wake up early, I do the whole workout, including the 15-minute pilates challenge.  The challenge is a standing all-body workout which is really great!

If you are a beginner and new to pilates, I highly recommend this DVD since you will not have a professional trainer watching over you to make sure you do the execerises with proper form.

There are similar exercises like Mari Winsor has, but there are also a few new ones.  Now I alternate the Winsor pilates DVD's with Denise Austin's DVD.  That way, it might benefit using other muscles that I haven't been working.

There are 3 exercises for abs, and 1 for each of the following:  hips, thighs, buttocks. In addition, there is a standing exercise.  The exercises are all 10 minutes in length. I like this because I can just do 1 or 2 if I don't have much time.  In addition, you can customize the workouts by picking the ones you want to do at the beginning of the tape.

The exercises are well chosen and really hit where they should.  Unlike Winsor pilates, Denise actually does enough reps so you can feel it working.  There are 7 x 10 minute sections: a warm-up, 3 for abs/waist/back or 'the core' then hips, thighs, buns and the 15 minute 'challenge' which is a mix of all the exercises done while standing.  This is great, really tests your balance and I do it twice as a great warm-up before I do weights.

The setting, sound/picture quality and menu are are fantastic - you can program any/all of the exercises in the order you like, you can even choose multiple plays of areas that need a little more work.

I hope Denise releases more workouts of this quality, so many of her dvds are gathering dust on my shelf - this one I really use on a regular basis.

This workout is for intermediates, if you are a beginner I would suggest you start with Rael 7 pilates as he is a fantastic instructor/teacher and you can safely learn the basics.  If you want another great pilates workout try Rael's 17 and 27 too - superb quality.",1150416000,22,1219,4.315789473684211

But when I put away my snooty hat and get down to the basics, I have to say that this DVD from Denise Austin actually offers up a pretty good light toning workout. And the programmable functions on the DVD are great for someone like me, who mixes and matches segments like crazy. Denise is no Rael or Moira Stott, but if you're already familiar with Pilates form, you'll get by fine without precise instruction on all the moves. And yes, I know Pilates is about conditioning the whole body, and spot toning is really the antithesis of true Pilates. So when I do this DVD, I mentally tape over the ""Pilates"" part of the title and just consider it a ""hit the spot"" workout. In that way, it does the job quite well.",1150243200,9,841,4.329113924050633

But I do rate this 3/5 stars because there is no stretch or cardio components, so you'll have to get that elsewhere because it's not on this DVD.  Also, you get little to none toning of your arms in this DVD.

I enjoy doing my toning using both this DVD and Denise's ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" although I do admit I enjoy ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" better than this one.

I don't care too much for the setup of this DVD.  Whenever I go to play it, it doesn't go to the main screen and instead goes to the screen to play the low-level core/tummy workout.

The format of this DVD is great because you can get right to the menu to choose your workout without a lot of intro or talk upfront like many other pilates DVDs.  The Jennifer Kries DVDs are better for method and instruction but this is a good alternative for those who need the flexibility of short segments in a workout.",1141948800,14,708,4.579365079365079
2374564,5,B000A6T1LS,"I have always hated to exercise and hated going to the gym even more. So I decided to try something and get this Hit the Spot Pilates DVD to do at home. I found it fun, easy to follow, yet challenging at the same time. I love that you can customize your workout. Within 3 weeks of working out to this video about 3 times a week I had already seen amazing results! My posture has improved dramatically, I lost 5 pounds and 2 inches around my waist!! Denise Austin's workout style and delivery keeps me motivated, and now I can't wait to workout! This DVD is well worth what I paid for and then some!",1141862400,13,598,4.163793103448276
2374565,1,B000A6T1LS,"This was by far,hands down, the WORST workout tape I've ever purchased-EVER. I actually threw it out. Denise Austin blows through each exercise like it's a ""beat the clock"" video, rather than taking time to focus on the correct form for each position. It was terrible, please, take my advice - do not waste your money on this.",1141776000,11,326,4.637931034482759
2374566,5,B000A6T1LS,"I used to own the Winsor Pilates series, but for some reason was never crazy about it, it literally sat on my shelf for years before I gave in and sold it on eBay.  This was about six months ago, and since then I've been on a ""quest"" to find what I would find to be the ""ultimate"" pilates DVD, or even series of DVD's, on the market.  After ordering a couple of DVD's I found to be just mediocre, I finally decided to give this one a shot.  At first I admit to being hesitant, as I've never really had anything against Denise Austin but wasn't a huge fan, either.

Well, let me just say that I was pleased to find everything I'd been looking for in ""Hit the Spot"" - first of all, it's visually gorgeous, with different backdrops to coincide with the various segments; an enthusiastic, but not overwhelmingly annoying Denise Austin coaching and motivating you every step of the way (her constant comments of ""think of how great you'll look in those shorts"" hold very true in my situation, as I am not out to lose weight per se but have a LOT of toning to do); and, finally, 10-minute segments that work each part of the body that you can either do all together, seperately, etc., all time permitting and tailored to fit one's own workout preferences.  Done correctly, you really feel this effective workout without being in unecessary pain as a result, unlike other workouts I've used.

I've only used this DVD a couple of times but this is the first time in a very long time that I actually look forward to the next time I will be working out - I plan to do a half hour or forty minutes worth of segments at least three times a week, and see what happens from there.  After all, in answer to Denise's question yes, I really do want to look good in my shorts this summer!",1141516800,9,1770,4.297297297297297
2374567,5,B000A6T1LS,I really like this DVD because you can customize your workout.  There are 6 segments focusing on different areas and you can program the workout to add which segments you want to do.  The exercises themselves are challenging but not too hard that you won't want to do them.,1140998400,7,273,4.551020408163265
2374568,4,B000A6T1LS,I really like Denise Austin and have used her Dvds before.  I like this new one it has 10 min workouts that are good for me. I am a mom of 2 so I like this cause I can find 10 mins to do it in.  I usally do 2 or 3 of them a day. The first time I did the 15 min bouns I was so sore the day after.  I can see that is it working and I am getting more toned.  Good workout!!!,1140652800,10,371,3.2298850574712645
2374569,4,B000A6T1LS,A good mix of different exercises that you can do together or individually. This was recommended in our local paper by some fitness experts and I am not disappointed. I have been doing pilates for over 3 yr and have used other tapes - this probably being the most comprehensive. I have to say Denise is also easier to take on this one than on others I have owned. Another plus is the  tropical background shots are welcome in the middle of a cold midwestern winter.,1140566400,7,465,4.406976744186046
2374590,5,B000A6T1LS,"I've owned alot of Denise's Workouts. This is one of my Favorites. I like the location. It's like someone's back outside patio, with pretty flowers. I like this on time crunch, sore days! Denise always has short effective fun wokouts.",1140393600,5,234,4.875
2374591,4,B000A6T1LS,"Denise is not very good at warning you ahead of time about what's coming next.  Despite that, it's pretty easy to follow along and get a good workout.",1139529600,2,150,4.357142857142857
2374592,3,B000A6T1LS,"It's good but not amazing. If you have done pilates before, it doens't give you a huge challenge. It's not terrible, it's just... ok.",1138492800,2,133,4.583333333333333
2374593,5,B000A6T1LS,"I have Denise's Pilates Mat Workout DVD that I've been doing for months.  I got this DVD as a present and love, love, love it!!!  My buns are sore as I type this.  I know I'm working parts of my body that I wasn't hitting with her other DVD, though I love that one too!

I love the variety and fast pace of her workout.  I'm finished before I know it.  You couldn't ask for more in a pilates workout DVD...pick whatever area you want to target ~ abs, waist, thighs, buns.

And it's perfect for those who lack time on a work day and have more time on the weekend.  It's all in one DVD!  What a great buy.  Better yet, it was a present!  :)

For beginners, I strongly suggest using her Pilates Mat Workout first before moving on to this one.  This is a quicker paced workout and could discourage beginners.",1136937600,13,804,4.142857142857143
2374594,5,B000A6T1LS,was the best part of the dvd.. i love it..,1136764800,5,42,3.3
2374595,5,B000A6T1LS,I agree with what everyone else has said.  The ten minute chunks are great and you never get bored because you can mix it up.  You really feel it and see results without ever feeling like you worked yourself to death.  Great buy!,1136332800,9,229,4.27906976744186
2374596,5,B000A6T1LS,"If you only have 10-minutes to workout or you want to add a Pilates routine after walking or a cardio session, this Denise Austin DVD gives you 7 10-minute target workouts or you can select specific workouts and play them all at once. You can also choose to exercise for 30 minutes, either focusing on the Abs and Waist Line or Lower Body. There is also a 15-minute Pilates Challenge.

The intermediate pace makes this an invigorating workout routine and Denise's ""double the workout in half the time"" exercise are unique and creative. While this is mostly Pilates, there are a few Yoga poses. Denise Austin also takes familiar exercises and combines them or increases the challenge.

I am finding this DVD to be most useful as a customizable routine. This allows for more variety and that makes exercising more fun. The new Denise Austin DVDs are encouraging, vibrant and very enjoyable. The outdoor settings are healing and the exercises are creative.

2374597,5,B000A6T1LS,"I love this DVD because it makes you work, but in easily digestible 10-minute chunks.  And because you can customize your workout you won't get bored.  Plus, the short segments keep it from being discouraging.  Instead of being unable to finish an hour long DVD and feeling frustrated, you can start with one complete mini workout and just slowly work your way up.  It's also great for busy, busy people.  Who doesn't have 10 or 15 minutes?  I LOVE the 15-minute ""Pilates Challenge"" at the end. It gets your heart pumping just enough to be invigorating, not exhausting.  I do it in the mornings to wake up!  This is a good buy.",1133136000,19,627,4.535714285714286
2374598,5,B000A6T1LS,I LOVE this DVD.  I have only used it a few times and have already seen results especially in my abs.  There are several pilates workouts in this DVD all about 10 minute a piece and I usually do at least 2 workouts a day and want to go up to three.  This really gives my muscles a good workout and the time fly's by!  LOVE IT!!!,1132272000,17,328,3.8507462686567164
2374599,5,B000A6T1LS,"Denise has tweaked the Pilates moves on this workout for the ultimate challenge to the deepest muscles in your core and lower body. During certain excruciating parts, I actually have to stop and recover before I can resume. But Denise keeps encouraging and motivating throughout, so I happily keep going. As a plus, the tropical setting is the loveliest I've ever seen on an exercise program and the music is pleasant-yet-lively.

Since this workout mainly emphasizes the core and lower body, I like to do it in between days where I do one of Denise's dvds that work out the upper body. The 7 chapters (3 levels of intensity for the abs, 3 for the legs/hips, and one full body challenge) can be arranged to play by the viewer's preference. I start with the 15-minute Pilates challenge (which really gets me going), followed by one 10-minute leg chapter and one 10-minute ab chapter. By arranging it this way, the dvd offers three different 35-minute workouts. It's a similar set-up to Denise's  Personal Training dvd.

I saw Denise promoting this dvd and her new nutrition book on Larry King. She is a very articulate and intelligent person, and her sweet, bubbly enthusiasm seems to be completely sincere. Her workouts have really improved the quality of my life, and I plan on picking up her new book too.",1128211200,83,1307,4.774336283185841
