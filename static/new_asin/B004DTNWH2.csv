8426122,4,B004DTNWH2,I liked this game except for the season 1 episodes that are too old.  In my opinion the season 1 episodes are not as good.,1385856000,,122,3.88
8426123,3,B004DTNWH2,"I found this in the $5 bin at Wal*Mart the other day. Included on the set are the first 10 episodes of the show's first season. They are listed on the back of the DVD as follows:

1.  Johnny to the Center of the Earth / Johnny X
2.  Johnny vs. Bling Bling Boy / Johnny Impossible
3.  Aqua Johnny / Johnny & the Amazing Turbo Action Backpack
4.  Johnny Test: Party Monster / Johnny Test: Extreme Crime Stopper
5.  Johnny & the Ice Pigs / Johnny's House of Horrors
6.  Johnny's Super Smarty Pants / Take Your Johnny to Work
7.  Johnny & the Mega Robotics / Johnny Gets Mooned
8.  Johnny's Turbo Time Rewinder / Johnny Hollywood
9.  Sonic Johnny / The Return of Johnny X
10.  The Dog Days of Johnny / Johnny's Pink Plague

Overall though, I'd rather spend the extra dollar and get the complete first and second seasons (16 more episodes) here at amazon (currently listed at $7.99).",1322006400,3,878,4.286585365853658
