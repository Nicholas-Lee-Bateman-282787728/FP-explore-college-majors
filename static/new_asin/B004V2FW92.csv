8442810,4,B004V2FW92,"This movie is a multi star movie. Rajesh Khanna has done very few multi star movies. To his credit he has single handedly made a no of movies successful. In this movie he has Dharamendra and Vinod Khanna as his co-stars. However, his portrayal of the character is most outstanding. The movie has a good story but the editing leaves much desired. The music by Laxmikant Pyarelal could have been better - only one song picturized on Rajesh Khanna is good and there is a Holi song which is remembered. Rajesh Khanna excels in his performance and only Dharamendra could withstand his powerful portrayal. This movie is well mounted but has something missing to be a classic but a must see for Rajesh Khanna and Dharamendra fans.",1306281600,,723,4.700787401574803
