8699684,4,B00SXA4FBE,"The film opens with a series of Marine phrases and history which comes quickly across the screen. The longer ones require a pause button to fully read, at least for me. Sgt. Carter (Mike 'The Miz' Mizanin) is now a civilian working for Hawthorne Global Security. It is his first day on the job, as he has a few days worth of growth on his face. His job is to protect (along with a bunch of co-workers) Olivia Tanis (Melissa Roxburgh) a smart talking 24 year old who has information to take down Genesis, who manufactured substandard military hardware. (This must be the military items we never check to ensure they are made to specifications.) Global is subcontracted to the Department of Justice.

The action starts out early and continues through the film. There is some attempt at ""First Blood"" type of scenes that could have been better developed to make the film more interesting. Tanis, who initially loathes her protectors, especially Carter, quickly must rely on Carter for survival.

The film suffered from the same problems as previous films. The Miz can't act. The plot is straight, improbable, and mindless. The dialogue is dry. On the plus side the creation of the character Olivia Tanis provided the needed internal drama and conflict as she becomes the wild card in the film that is otherwise void of mystery and surprises. Danielle Moinet, the blond on the cover has a minor role and few lines. For some reason, late in the film, she does take off her vest so we can see her in a tank top.

Good mindless action film for those who can't get enough of Steve Austin type acting.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Excessive gun fire and some knife fights. Minimal blood.",1428796800,,1685,4.6824324324324325
