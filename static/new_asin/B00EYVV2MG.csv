I love the story of 2 men who's girlfriend  is giving birth and when they arrive at the hospital they receive a letter. The woman says I do not know who is the father, I can't face you and I can't raise this baby so I am leaving her to you. Both men, who were best friends decide that they will raise the baby together since she will not have a mother she will have 2 Fathers.

Wen Zhen Hua is a florist and a clean freak and an excellent cook. Tang Hsiang Si is a lawyer in his own law firm. Both men are completely adoring fathers. All they want is Wen Di's happiness.  Fang Jing Zhu  meets Tang Hsiang Si in the Supermarket, after she hit his parked car and left a note. She turns out to be Wen Di's 1st grade teacher.

There are many people that come into Wen Di's life and everyone is kind and loving and they have each others back when times get tough, it is a family drama and a comedy and it is well balanced. You meet Fang Jing Zhu's family and they are a hoot, their father is hilarious and they own an auto-repair shop. I saw a lot of similarities to my own family.

Taiwan is a beautiful island nation and it is showcased in this show well. There are 73 episodes and each one has you asking for more. I binge watched this starting September 25th and finished October 8th. If you can read the subtitles you will really enjoy this story of 2 Fathers.

Leroy Young who plays Tang Hsiang Si is an incredible talent. He plays humorous, mischievous, loving daddy, strong man, gentle man, angry man forgiving man. He is a good man and his facial expressions really help you to know what he is feeling. That's the other thing I really enjoyed is that the show does not chatter at you. It lets you enjoy the moment, watch them do their thing. Also when they are doing something boring like a parents lecturing their kids or a girlfriend going on and on, they play it in fast forward for you.

The show has a real satisfying ending; definitely worth the journey and they wrapped all the storylines well. Oh and the sound track is really wonderful.",1475971200,3,2148,4.221951219512195
