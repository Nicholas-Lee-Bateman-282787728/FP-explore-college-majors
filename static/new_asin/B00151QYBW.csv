3138015,1,B00151QYBW,"This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Even if it is on TV, don't waste your time watching it, the movie is that bad.  There is absolutely nothing entertaining at all, it is very cheaply made, the acting even from some former stars such as Daryl Hannah who may have been able to act in the past just is not evident here, such as her reaction when her daughter tells her shocking news I don't want to live in this crappy town and am off to New York.

The whole plot and script is very poorly written, the sharks look terrible, there's no actual shark eating people scenes just red food colouring in the water after a shot of half a computer generated shark from the side is seen swimming towards the surface unrealistically quickly.  Plus it is often the exact same footage used over and over again.  There's not even any good looking actors in it, the daughter is probably the best but even she's pretty average. The actors in this are well past their prime, I mean if Daryl Hannah got roles once based on her looks, she certainly isn't going to anymore.  The characters themselves are very weak loser characters. A film like this needs people you hope survive and bad guys you hope get their commeupance (eaten), but you felt more empathy for the developers and the other townsfolk than the supposed heroes.  Those characters didn't seem to have any legitimate argument for blocking the development and financial relief for every other struggling to survive town resident by not selling their home.

The basic plot is a town developer wants to develop the town into a really beneficial to everyone modern looking development but one fisherman and his wife own a property in the centre of town that blocks the development from going ahead.  The developer lets some waste from a plant they own go into the water to destroy the fishing industry (so the fisherman will be forced to sell) and inadvertently cause sharks to swarm into schools and develop homicidal maniac tendencies with a desire to kill everything they swim across.

There's lots of parts of the movie that just don't make any sense, such as a lifeguard stops watching the water and starts playing with some kid instead, without asking another lifeguard to watch the water because the deadbeat father asks him too (neither deadbeat parent gets eaten either I might add). Then he disappears and no one ever notices let alone starts a search.  The unnecessary romantic interest sub plot for the teenage daughter comes from two surfers travelling there to surf yet there are no waves at all and yet we still have footage of them carrying boards under their arms to the practically flat water in the background. Had the director not heard of a bluescreen?  I think they had to get a boat to go by to give the little ripples they had.  Sharks can swim at supersonic speed in this film yet can never reach the good guys when they are in the water.

Plus, how long is this movie, a bit of editing wouldn't have gone astray, it goes for over two hours!  It's like they had an idea for two movies but couldn't decide which one to make or maybe it was their first movie and they knew they'd never be given any money to make a second so wanted to get both their ideas filmed now.

This movie is terrible.  I know some unrealistic plot, with psychopathic behaviour by animals they don't do in real life can be entertaining simply because it is so far fetched, such as Snakes on a Plane for example, but Shark Swarm doesn't even provide that!",1227225600,,3513,4.541996830427892
3138016,1,B00151QYBW,"I just couldn't resist the opportunity on commenting on this disaster of a movie... actually the worst I have seen in the last say... five years, and on the top five of my life. I am frankly surprised that it got some fair reviews!
I bought it for two reasons: a respectable cast that includes Darryl Hanna, Armand Assante and John Schneider and, being a shark movie fan, I have to admit that the cover was attractive.
I am so disappointed with this cast appearing in a crummy movie like this... Because man... I have seen bad movies... and this one!!
This is about some sharks somewhere that go wild and attack in bunches (swarm) because of some toxic waste thrown in the water and they attack and eat everybody without control. The shark attack scenes are actually just one (or maybe two) same take repeated over and over again. The sharks swim at a ridiculous and impossible speed and the take goes in and out so fast that it is hard to distinguish them at all. What you can notice at first glance is the computerized effect that, as I said, is repeated too many times not to be noticed. The sharks eat half of the town people... and nobody notices anything!!! Hahaha... There is a scene where a lifeguard is playing with a little girl right there in the shallow water waist high at the shore and the shark swarm (yes, the whole swarm) comes in and eat him and none of the lot of people standing right there sees anything or notice the guy is missing at all!! Not then or after! And that happens with one person or a group of people every five minutes... and nobody notices or even suspects anything is wrong!!
At the end, when it comes to the part where you want to see the bad guy
(the worst performance by Armand Assante ever) eaten, the sharks bump ONCE into the posts of a huge pier where he and all of the remaining bad guys are standing... and the pier falls off into the sea!!! Hahahaha... I only laughed harder when I watched the movie than now!! Oh... and then the sharks eat all the bad guys!!
Then, as if this was not enough, on one of the last scenes fins are seen on top of the water again  near the beach... rubber fins if you look close!
And there is still something more... it goes on forever!! It lasts 164 eternal minutes during which all that happens is more and more people get eaten with the same impossible to understand fact that it goes unnoticed.
Oh yes, of course there is a plot to it... This bad guy is contaminating the water because he wants to take over the town to get rich building resorts and exploiting the people out of their homes and properties. But that is so lame and hackneyed that it is not even worth to mention.
I am not going to comment on the performances... How could they be any good with this hollow script and direction?
I got bored long before it ended... but, I have to admit, it was one of those terrible movies you watch until the end, and you don't really know why!",1223424000,7,2924,4.316363636363636
3138017,2,B00151QYBW,"Obviously you don't expect much when you pick up a movie like this.  This one will live right down to your expectations.  This is a really predictable made-for-tv movie.  Let me sum up all the kills for you:
1. Footage of cgi sharks swimming ridiculously fast.
2. A shot of someone swimming in the water.
3. A shot of a cgi shark swimming up really close to the camera.
4. A brief shot of some red colored water.
5. Cut away.

That's it.  I don't think there's a single shot of a person and a shark together at all in this movie.  Just really, really boring.",1219881600,10,558,4.216981132075472
3138018,3,B00151QYBW,"Greedy land developing schmuck, Armand Assante is buying up the properties of a small coastal fishing town called Full Moon Bay so he can put up a bunch of condos.  He's got everyone in his pocket, but fisherman John Schneider just won't sell, and his property is the key to the whole project!  Assante decides to play hardball by bullying Schneider with his henchmen.  But most importantly, he's dumping toxins in the ocean to kill off all the fish, and in theory, ruin Schneider's business.
Oh, it kills the fish alright, but it messes with the food chain and creates a hungry swarm......A FRIGGIN' SHARK SWARM!!!!  Now there's a buttload of sharks chomping down on everything they can get their fins on, including each other.  Schneider and his woman, Daryl Hannah have got to turn the tide on this ravenous swarm(Ya like that ""turn the tide"" ocean-type pun?), and at the same time save their little town from becoming tacky.
This movie is an epic.  Sort of.  It's awfully damn long, longer than a movie like this should be(damn near 2 hours and 40 minutes!).  But from my understanding it was a miniseries so that accounts for the ridiculous length.  It's really not all that impressive.  It's just interesting enough to keep you watching to the end, but that's about it.  There are a bunch of pointless subplots, and good actors are used in very cookie cutter type roles, Assante and F. Murray Abraham especially(Abraham was almost downright pointless!).  There are seemingly endless scenes of various people getting attacked by the sharks, at least one scene for every four that go by.  This is kinda funny coz nobody seems to notice such a massive amount of people are missing!  The sharks are CGI of course, making their scenes look like a shark documentary you'd see on Animal Planet or something, but with a bit more ferocity of course.  It looks fake and silly, but I suppose when you're doing a movie about a swarm of hungry and aggressive sharks it's really the only route you can take.  I can't imagine sharks can act too well.
But being this is a made for Sc-Fi movie, that alone will make folks determine if they want to see it.  And with about eight billion direct-to-video shark films on the shelves, most folks have seen at least one or two of them before and will know what to expect considering this isn't much different.  Just much longer.",1219190400,14,2361,4.675544794188862
3138019,4,B00151QYBW,"Let me start by saying that we cannot expect much from a shark movie.  I mean after Jaws.... there's not much to really do with a shark story, except add a biological alteration mixed with lots of sharks. This kind of reminded me of that Spring Break Shark Attack movie, only much better (for one thing, fins weren't overlapping in the water.... the effects were pretty cool in this one).  The cast in Shark Swarm was pretty good.  Had John Schneider killed a shark with an arrow with dynamite on it, that might have ""jumped the shark"" for this movie.  Overall I was impressed with this movie.  It was horror without a lot of gore (believe it or not....).  If you like shark attack movies. and don't mind an almost 3 hour flick, check this one out.  Another recommendation would be 12 Days of Terror.  Not Jaws-quality (since all shark movies will be compared to Jaws, but this one is actually the true-life event that inspired Jaws), but worth watching at least once.

I guess the only step left for shasrk movies at this point would be a land shark, flying shark, talking shark, revised megalodon story or sharks in space.  Then again, I wouldn't mind seeing something done on bull sharks, which can survive for long periods of time in fresh waters.  One was caught in Missouri several years ago in the Mississippi River.  I think there was a movie done about sharks in a river a few years ago.... but it sucked.  There is also the USS Indianapolis movie due out next year, I think.",1215302400,4,1484,4.51310861423221
3138020,5,B00151QYBW,It was very exciting movie.  It brought the feelings from Jaws but with new twist.,1214438400,2,82,4.466666666666667
3138021,3,B00151QYBW,"I think this movie has what many other movies of this type lack: good CGI for its budget, acceptable acting, and OK plot. It is also unusually long for this kind of films. Unlike most movies of this type, this one does not last 90 or 80 but 164 minutes. Thats as long as the second Harry Potter film  and the last Pirates of the Caribbean film! But its better than most films of this genre.",1214265600,3,390,4.131578947368421
3138022,3,B00151QYBW,"This movie had an interesting story. I watched it because I had family members that were extras in the movie (parts of the movie were filmed in Mendocino). I thought some parts were a little gross, but the story held our attention. I thought certain things were unbelievable but I thought Daryl Hannah and John Schneider did a good acting job.",1213833600,7,343,4.639344262295082
3138023,4,B00151QYBW,"Obviously, this movie is not Jaws.  To hold it to those standards is setting the viewer up for immediate disappointment.  But if you take the movie for what it is--a two-hour-and-forty-minute shark drama/epic, then you just might enjoy it as much as I did.

Some of the characters are laughable, and some of them are even kind of likable.  Some of the acting is terrible, and some of it is at least okay.  And for CG sharks, these aren't the worst out there.

And the lengthiness of it, I for one never found it slow.  I never got bored.  I don't know; it's definitely not Jaws.  Just know that going in and you'll be alright.",1213401600,10,626,4.373913043478261
3138024,3,B00151QYBW,"Anyone who lives on a desert island in the Gulf of Mexico, as I do, has to love shark movies, even when they are produced on a small budget, filmed overnight, and made for television.

The DVD of this very long (164-minute) shark movie, however, has no closed captions or subtitles, which will be bad news for many of the 9 million deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in the United States (not to mention Canada) who might otherwise enjoy another passable Jaws rip-off.

That Genius Products and Rhi Entertainment produced this DVD may serve as a caveat. Hoping to find captions on a DVD from those companies is (as President Bush might say) like buying a pig in a poke. Eight out of nine Genius/Rhi DVDs that I own lack closed captions and subtitles (in any language). Perhaps I do not need to add that there is not a word about captions or subtitles on this DVD or its box.

Closed captions and subtitles are cheap to produce. Producers omit them only when they are clueless about marketing  or when they are determined to maximize the ""bottom line"" regardless of consequences. Federal trade laws ought to require disclosure of captions and subtitles (and the lack of them) for all DVDs sold. It is essential ""product information."" The American public should not have to tolerate shark-like behavior from the entertainment industry.",1212883200,6,1331,4.799126637554585
3138045,3,B00151QYBW,"As you may have read in other reviews, this movie is a longer film.  This does not help the movie any as some of it could have certainly been trimmed and edited out to make the film more enjoyable.  Imagine a drama film about a greedy developer trying to buy out everyone on a coastal fishing town... they film the whole movie with alot of long, drawn out scenes to make the movie a full length of say 1 hour and 50 minutes.  Then they decide it is too dull, so they film a bunch of sharks and shark kills and speckle it through out the movie - making it the 2 hours plus that it is.  Now you have our film.

 It is not terrible, but the shark attacks are not as spectacular as they could be.  This is made up for by adding more of them... kind of a quantity over quality deal.  You see plenty of swimming sharks and more sharks and people falling in the water and more sharks and sharks lunging at the camera with shrieking violins to try scare you and some bloody water.

 More drama and drama and some more scenes of sharks swimming violently.

 The bigger issue is that there is little to no involvement of the sharks in the plot.  No one even knows the sharks are there until 3/4 of the film is even over with.  They may show shark kills, but they are not connected to the film - the town isn't scared of sharks or even notice that people are missing.  The threat of the film is the land developer... he has an old plant that is pumping waste into the surrounding waters.  The sharks are affected by it becoming overly aggressive, but the majority of the film doesn't even acknowledge the sharks at all.  This leaves the viewer to drudge through a slow moving plot of this drama.... only being kept watching due to the hopes of seeing the next shark attack.  But as the movie goes you notice even the shark attacks are just sharks thrashing, people falling in the water, and sharks lunging at the screen.  Only one scene actually involved a human and a shark that you get to actually see... that is a scene where partially devoured sharks wash up on the shore and an old beach comber gets curious and tries removing a flask from the sharks' mouth and he gets his hand bitten off.  I guess this was made for TV or something as many of the scenes even end and fade to black as if you are going to commercial break.

 Yeah this movie needed some serious editing and they really needed to involve the sharks into the story more and make them the ""threat"" of the film.  You could seriously cut all the shark attacks out of the movie and you wouldn't affect the story at all.  It really does appear as though they made the drama movie, finished it and then edited-in a bunch of shark attacks to liven it up.  The sharks look good, but they are back story to this drama film and even when they know about the sharks, they seem kind of.... unaffected by it.",1377388800,,2854,4.231053604436229

3138047,4,B00151QYBW,"Greed and corruption, the love of the almighty dollar, and an unscrupulous developer make this story interesting and suspenseful.

3138048,1,B00151QYBW,"Want to hear sharks that roar like lions?  This is your movie.

Want to see lots of screen time with ex-""The Dukes of Hazard"" actor John Schneider and ""Splash"" actress Daryl Hannah going back and forth with a villain-of-the-week lame-o played by Armand Assante?  You've come to the right place.

Want to spend almost 3 hours watching a slowly paced melodrama whose only difference between it and daytime soap operas are its natural lighting and a different variety of sharks?  Pop this baby in!

This turgid piece of cinematic excrement is long on ""who cares?"" drama and short on Jaws-style suspense.  The sharks, mostly Great Whites, are only monstrous in our fears of them and what's on screen doesn't capitalize or expand on those fears.  I'll admit that the acting is at times bordering on fine (but at other times is stiff and awkward) but people who see maneating shark movies aren't looking for an extensive dose of melodrama or meh scenes of sharks swimming through the waters creating large blood stains.  They also don't want sharks that roar like lions, unless, of course, the shark in question is a crossbreed of an actual lion and a shark.  And this movie doesn't even come close to a ""so bad its good"" movie.  So, please, heed my warning and stay out of this one's waters.",1346544000,,1286,4.696428571428571

3138051,4,B00151QYBW,"I watched this mini-series Christmas day and thoroughly enjoyed it. It has most of the elements of great icky bug. A high body count, the typical bad guy, and the heroes out to save the day. The only things missing were the f-bombs and the gratuitous sex scenes. Still, for a good time, I can't complain.

Armand Asante is a great bad guy and he plays it to the hilt here. As the evil corporate bigwig out to buy the town, he plays his part with zeal.

John Schneider and Daryl Hanna play the main protagonists and they do plenty of kissy face between shark attack scenes. And of course, they have a daughter who gets into trouble and has to be rescued, not to mention their grandmother.

The special effects are nothing to write home about, but get the point across. The body count is quite high and it was a bit weird that so many got eaten without some kind of panic or a ban on the beach taking place. Of course, logic is not supposed to be part of these movies and at least this one didn't go too overboard as far as I'm concerned.

This being a TV miniseries, I can understand how tame it had to be, yet I still found myself enjoying it. Recommended.",1293494400,3,1156,4.240909090909091

***POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS***

The basic premise of ""Shark Swarm"" is yet another Hollywood warning about the dangers of trashing Mother Nature.  Hamilton Lux (Assante) has been authorizing the dumping of toxic waste into the waters of Full Moon Bay for a long enough time to kill off the fishing industry and turn every shark in the area into an ultra-violent maneater.  Daniel Wilder (Schneider), his wife (Hannah), and his brother set out to stop Lux from taking over their town in order to build his development of luxury condos.  F. Murray Abraham plays Dr. Bill Girdler--the university professor who seems to spend a large chunk of the movie sitting at computers, tracking the shark swarms by satellite, and relaying their position to the movie's heroes.

O.K., the story is lame but it isn't any lamer than ""Hammerhead Shark Attack"", ""It Lives"", and similar fare.  The acting is so-so.  I have to admit I was rather surprised and saddened to see four actors--Hannah, Assante, Schneider, and Abraham--who used to be respectable actors choosing to be in this turkey.  I guess money is money.  The other actors are noticeably bad.  The guy who plays Schneider's brother and his EPA girlfriend are terrible, as is the girl playing Schneider and Hannah's daughter.  My husband and I both found the daughter particularly irritating, as her idea of acting was apparently to simper like an idiot in practically every scene.

Schneider's character was also hard to cheer on, as he came across as a hot-headed, arrogant jerk.  I've always liked Armand Assante, but was saddened to see how much hair he has lost.  This also wasn't his best acting effort, as he mumbled almost all of his lines and was impossible to understand.  F. Murray Abraham did O.K., given the quality of the material, as did Darryl Hannah.  Hannah's appearance, however, was quite shocking.  Even though I knew she was in this movie before I started watching it, it took me a few minutes and a double-take to recognize her.  Frankly, it almost looked like she was on Prednisone, as she had a moon-faced appearance that is a typical side effect of that medication.

Overall, this movie is about what you would expect.  The dialogue--with the exception of a rather funny Sea World retort--is poor.  The filmmakers seemed to spend little time on the script and put most of their efforts into making lots of CGI sharks.  Personally, I find the CGI annoying.  Call me old fashioned, but I much prefer the mechanical shark look--when it's done well, of course.  The CGI sharks zoomed around ridiculously fast, roared frequently, and made a sound like a jet rocket every time they swam.  It was good for a laugh, anyway.

Also rather annoying was the way the scenes were strung together.  It was very choppy.  They'd just start getting into a scene when they would suddenly cut to something completely different.  This was especially noticeable in the overabundance of scuba diver attacks.  The main characters would talk briefly and then the scene would suddenly cut to some unknown person/persons scuba diving in the middle of the night, no less.  They would be immediately attacked and then the scene would suddenly cut to something else.  It was never explained who these people were, why on earth they were diving in the middle of the night, or why no one in the small town of Full Moon Bay ever seemed to notice or report their disappearance.  I believe there were around 4-5 short scenes showing the demise of anonymous scuba divers and they all played out in almost exactly the same way.  After a couple of these scenes, the attacks became very predictable and boring.

Ultimately, this movie isn't great and I would never buy it (I checked it out of the library), but it's O.K. if you're looking for something low-quality, cheesy, mindless, and semi-entertaining.  For those who are seeking a shark attack movie of a much higher caliber, I would recommend ""Twelve Days of Terror"" with John Rhys-Davies--a much better flick that is based on actual events.",1274832000,4,4164,4.863636363636363

There is a scene where a lifeguard is playing with a little girl right there in the shallow water waist high at the shore and the shark swarm (yes, the whole swarm) comes in and eat him and none of the lot of people standing right there sees anything or notice the guy is missing at all!! Not then or after! And that happens with one person or a group of people every five minutes... and nobody notices or even suspects anything is wrong!!
At the end, when it comes to the part where you want to see the bad guy
(the worst performance by Armand Assante ever) eaten, the sharks bump ONCE into the posts of a huge pier where he and all of the remaining bad guys are standing... and the pier falls off into the sea!!! Hahahaha... I only laughed harder when I watched the movie than now!! Oh... and then the sharks eat all the bad guys!!
Then, as if this was not enough, on one of the last scenes fins are seen on top of the water again  near the beach... rubber fins if you look close!
And there is still something more... it goes on forever!! It lasts 164 eternal minutes during which all that happens is more and more people get eaten with the same impossible to understand fact that it goes unnoticed.
Oh yes, of course there is a plot to it... This bad guy is contaminating the water because he wants to take over the town to get rich building resorts and exploiting the people out of their homes and properties. But that is so lame and hackneyed that it is not even worth to mention.
I am not going to comment on the performances... How could they be any good with this hollow script and direction?
I got bored long before it ended... but, I have to admit, it was one of those terrible movies you watch until the end, and you don't really know why!",1223424000,7,2924,4.316363636363636
3372514,2,B00151QYBW,"Obviously you don't expect much when you pick up a movie like this.  This one will live right down to your expectations.  This is a really predictable made-for-tv movie.  Let me sum up all the kills for you:
1. Footage of cgi sharks swimming ridiculously fast.
2. A shot of someone swimming in the water.
3. A shot of a cgi shark swimming up really close to the camera.
4. A brief shot of some red colored water.
5. Cut away.

That's it.  I don't think there's a single shot of a person and a shark together at all in this movie.  Just really, really boring.",1219881600,10,558,4.216981132075472
3372515,3,B00151QYBW,"Greedy land developing schmuck, Armand Assante is buying up the properties of a small coastal fishing town called Full Moon Bay so he can put up a bunch of condos.  He's got everyone in his pocket, but fisherman John Schneider just won't sell, and his property is the key to the whole project!  Assante decides to play hardball by bullying Schneider with his henchmen.  But most importantly, he's dumping toxins in the ocean to kill off all the fish, and in theory, ruin Schneider's business.
Oh, it kills the fish alright, but it messes with the food chain and creates a hungry swarm......A FRIGGIN' SHARK SWARM!!!!  Now there's a buttload of sharks chomping down on everything they can get their fins on, including each other.  Schneider and his woman, Daryl Hannah have got to turn the tide on this ravenous swarm(Ya like that ""turn the tide"" ocean-type pun?), and at the same time save their little town from becoming tacky.
This movie is an epic.  Sort of.  It's awfully damn long, longer than a movie like this should be(damn near 2 hours and 40 minutes!).  But from my understanding it was a miniseries so that accounts for the ridiculous length.  It's really not all that impressive.  It's just interesting enough to keep you watching to the end, but that's about it.  There are a bunch of pointless subplots, and good actors are used in very cookie cutter type roles, Assante and F. Murray Abraham especially(Abraham was almost downright pointless!).  There are seemingly endless scenes of various people getting attacked by the sharks, at least one scene for every four that go by.  This is kinda funny coz nobody seems to notice such a massive amount of people are missing!  The sharks are CGI of course, making their scenes look like a shark documentary you'd see on Animal Planet or something, but with a bit more ferocity of course.  It looks fake and silly, but I suppose when you're doing a movie about a swarm of hungry and aggressive sharks it's really the only route you can take.  I can't imagine sharks can act too well.
But being this is a made for Sc-Fi movie, that alone will make folks determine if they want to see it.  And with about eight billion direct-to-video shark films on the shelves, most folks have seen at least one or two of them before and will know what to expect considering this isn't much different.  Just much longer.",1219190400,14,2361,4.675544794188862
3372516,4,B00151QYBW,"Let me start by saying that we cannot expect much from a shark movie.  I mean after Jaws.... there's not much to really do with a shark story, except add a biological alteration mixed with lots of sharks. This kind of reminded me of that Spring Break Shark Attack movie, only much better (for one thing, fins weren't overlapping in the water.... the effects were pretty cool in this one).  The cast in Shark Swarm was pretty good.  Had John Schneider killed a shark with an arrow with dynamite on it, that might have ""jumped the shark"" for this movie.  Overall I was impressed with this movie.  It was horror without a lot of gore (believe it or not....).  If you like shark attack movies. and don't mind an almost 3 hour flick, check this one out.  Another recommendation would be 12 Days of Terror.  Not Jaws-quality (since all shark movies will be compared to Jaws, but this one is actually the true-life event that inspired Jaws), but worth watching at least once.

I guess the only step left for shasrk movies at this point would be a land shark, flying shark, talking shark, revised megalodon story or sharks in space.  Then again, I wouldn't mind seeing something done on bull sharks, which can survive for long periods of time in fresh waters.  One was caught in Missouri several years ago in the Mississippi River.  I think there was a movie done about sharks in a river a few years ago.... but it sucked.  There is also the USS Indianapolis movie due out next year, I think.",1215302400,4,1484,4.51310861423221

Some of the characters are laughable, and some of them are even kind of likable.  Some of the acting is terrible, and some of it is at least okay.  And for CG sharks, these aren't the worst out there.

3372521,3,B00151QYBW,"Anyone who lives on a desert island in the Gulf of Mexico, as I do, has to love shark movies, even when they are produced on a small budget, filmed overnight, and made for television.

The DVD of this very long (164-minute) shark movie, however, has no closed captions or subtitles, which will be bad news for many of the 9 million deaf and hard-of-hearing persons in the United States (not to mention Canada) who might otherwise enjoy another passable Jaws rip-off.

That Genius Products and Rhi Entertainment produced this DVD may serve as a caveat. Hoping to find captions on a DVD from those companies is (as President Bush might say) like buying a pig in a poke. Eight out of nine Genius/Rhi DVDs that I own lack closed captions and subtitles (in any language). Perhaps I do not need to add that there is not a word about captions or subtitles on this DVD or its box.

Closed captions and subtitles are cheap to produce. Producers omit them only when they are clueless about marketing  or when they are determined to maximize the ""bottom line"" regardless of consequences. Federal trade laws ought to require disclosure of captions and subtitles (and the lack of them) for all DVDs sold. It is essential ""product information."" The American public should not have to tolerate shark-like behavior from the entertainment industry.",1212883200,6,1331,4.799126637554585
3372542,3,B00151QYBW,"As you may have read in other reviews, this movie is a longer film.  This does not help the movie any as some of it could have certainly been trimmed and edited out to make the film more enjoyable.  Imagine a drama film about a greedy developer trying to buy out everyone on a coastal fishing town... they film the whole movie with alot of long, drawn out scenes to make the movie a full length of say 1 hour and 50 minutes.  Then they decide it is too dull, so they film a bunch of sharks and shark kills and speckle it through out the movie - making it the 2 hours plus that it is.  Now you have our film.

 It is not terrible, but the shark attacks are not as spectacular as they could be.  This is made up for by adding more of them... kind of a quantity over quality deal.  You see plenty of swimming sharks and more sharks and people falling in the water and more sharks and sharks lunging at the camera with shrieking violins to try scare you and some bloody water.

 More drama and drama and some more scenes of sharks swimming violently.

 The bigger issue is that there is little to no involvement of the sharks in the plot.  No one even knows the sharks are there until 3/4 of the film is even over with.  They may show shark kills, but they are not connected to the film - the town isn't scared of sharks or even notice that people are missing.  The threat of the film is the land developer... he has an old plant that is pumping waste into the surrounding waters.  The sharks are affected by it becoming overly aggressive, but the majority of the film doesn't even acknowledge the sharks at all.  This leaves the viewer to drudge through a slow moving plot of this drama.... only being kept watching due to the hopes of seeing the next shark attack.  But as the movie goes you notice even the shark attacks are just sharks thrashing, people falling in the water, and sharks lunging at the screen.  Only one scene actually involved a human and a shark that you get to actually see... that is a scene where partially devoured sharks wash up on the shore and an old beach comber gets curious and tries removing a flask from the sharks' mouth and he gets his hand bitten off.  I guess this was made for TV or something as many of the scenes even end and fade to black as if you are going to commercial break.

 Yeah this movie needed some serious editing and they really needed to involve the sharks into the story more and make them the ""threat"" of the film.  You could seriously cut all the shark attacks out of the movie and you wouldn't affect the story at all.  It really does appear as though they made the drama movie, finished it and then edited-in a bunch of shark attacks to liven it up.  The sharks look good, but they are back story to this drama film and even when they know about the sharks, they seem kind of.... unaffected by it.",1377388800,,2854,4.231053604436229

Want to see lots of screen time with ex-""The Dukes of Hazard"" actor John Schneider and ""Splash"" actress Daryl Hannah going back and forth with a villain-of-the-week lame-o played by Armand Assante?  You've come to the right place.

Want to spend almost 3 hours watching a slowly paced melodrama whose only difference between it and daytime soap operas are its natural lighting and a different variety of sharks?  Pop this baby in!

This turgid piece of cinematic excrement is long on ""who cares?"" drama and short on Jaws-style suspense.  The sharks, mostly Great Whites, are only monstrous in our fears of them and what's on screen doesn't capitalize or expand on those fears.  I'll admit that the acting is at times bordering on fine (but at other times is stiff and awkward) but people who see maneating shark movies aren't looking for an extensive dose of melodrama or meh scenes of sharks swimming through the waters creating large blood stains.  They also don't want sharks that roar like lions, unless, of course, the shark in question is a crossbreed of an actual lion and a shark.

A high body count, the typical bad guy, and the heroes out to save the day. The only things missing were the f-bombs and the gratuitous sex scenes. Still, for a good time, I can't complain.

Armand Asante is a great bad guy and he plays it to the hilt here. As the evil corporate bigwig out to buy the town, he plays his part with zeal.

John Schneider and Daryl Hanna play the main protagonists and they do plenty of kissy face between shark attack scenes. And of course, they have a daughter who gets into trouble and has to be rescued, not to mention their grandmother.

The special effects are nothing to write home about, but get the point across. The body count is quite high and it was a bit weird that so many got eaten without some kind of panic or a ban on the beach taking place. Of course, logic is not supposed to be part of these movies and at least this one didn't go too overboard as far as I'm concerned.

***POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS***

The basic premise of ""Shark Swarm"" is yet another Hollywood warning about the dangers of trashing Mother Nature.  Hamilton Lux (Assante) has been authorizing the dumping of toxic waste into the waters of Full Moon Bay for a long enough time to kill off the fishing industry and turn every shark in the area into an ultra-violent maneater.  Daniel Wilder (Schneider), his wife (Hannah), and his brother set out to stop Lux from taking over their town in order to build his development of luxury condos.  F. Murray Abraham plays Dr. Bill Girdler--the university professor who seems to spend a large chunk of the movie sitting at computers, tracking the shark swarms by satellite, and relaying their position to the movie's heroes.

O.K., the story is lame but it isn't any lamer than ""Hammerhead Shark Attack"", ""It Lives"", and similar fare.  The acting is so-so.  I have to admit I was rather surprised and saddened to see four actors--Hannah, Assante, Schneider, and Abraham--who used to be respectable actors choosing to be in this turkey.  I guess money is money.  The other actors are noticeably bad.  The guy who plays Schneider's brother and his EPA girlfriend are terrible, as is the girl playing Schneider and Hannah's daughter.  My husband and I both found the daughter particularly irritating, as her idea of acting was apparently to simper like an idiot in practically every scene.

Schneider's character was also hard to cheer on, as he came across as a hot-headed, arrogant jerk.  I've always liked Armand Assante, but was saddened to see how much hair he has lost.  This also wasn't his best acting effort, as he mumbled almost all of his lines and was impossible to understand.  F. Murray Abraham did O.K., given the quality of the material, as did Darryl Hannah.  Hannah's appearance, however, was quite shocking.  Even though I knew she was in this movie before I started watching it, it took me a few minutes and a double-take to recognize her.  Frankly, it almost looked like she was on Prednisone, as she had a moon-faced appearance that is a typical side effect of that medication.

Overall, this movie is about what you would expect.  The dialogue--with the exception of a rather funny Sea World retort--is poor.  The filmmakers seemed to spend little time on the script and put most of their efforts into making lots of CGI sharks.  Personally, I find the CGI annoying.  Call me old fashioned, but I much prefer the mechanical shark look--when it's done well, of course.  The CGI sharks zoomed around ridiculously fast, roared frequently, and made a sound like a jet rocket every time they swam.  It was good for a laugh, anyway.

Also rather annoying was the way the scenes were strung together.  It was very choppy.  They'd just start getting into a scene when they would suddenly cut to something completely different.  This was especially noticeable in the overabundance of scuba diver attacks.  The main characters would talk briefly and then the scene would suddenly cut to some unknown person/persons scuba diving in the middle of the night, no less.  They would be immediately attacked and then the scene would suddenly cut to something else.  It was never explained who these people were, why on earth they were diving in the middle of the night, or why no one in the small town of Full Moon Bay ever seemed to notice or report their disappearance.  I believe there were around 4-5 short scenes showing the demise of anonymous scuba divers and they all played out in almost exactly the same way.  After a couple of these scenes, the attacks became very predictable and boring.

Ultimately, this movie isn't great and I would never buy it (I checked it out of the library), but it's O.K. if you're looking for something low-quality, cheesy, mindless, and semi-entertaining.  For those who are seeking a shark attack movie of a much higher caliber, I would recommend ""Twelve Days of Terror"" with John Rhys-Davies--a much better flick that is based on actual events.",1274832000,4,4164,4.863636363636363

The story could have been summed up in a few words but for some reason they thought it should take 164 minutes.  The plot features an EVIL land developer (Armand Assante) who wants to decimate a small community in order to build a better community for the wealthy.  Most of the locals go along with this scheme, eagerly giving up home and hearth for filthy lucre!  One stubborn SOB (John Schneider) refuses to give in.  He's a fisherman, so EVIL Assante poisons the waters so there are no fishes to be had.  Enter the sharks who apparently like the `poison' and set about eating quite a few people (I counted over 20-some bodies, yet no one seems to notice these people were missing.  In passing, a teacher mentions 3 delinquent students.  That's it, no search parties, no outrage.  Gone and certainly forgotten).
I lost track of the number of scenes where someone looks as though they are about to say something profound, only to look off in the distance, saying nothing (Assante in particular).  The premise is fraught with inconsistencies and great lapses in logic.  The few townsfolk featured are either greedy, corrupt, or stupid, as they keep referring to `their community' that is about to be taken away from them and replaced with fancy homes they can't afford.  It's no surprise then that the EVIL Assante sanctions kidnapping and murder in order to further his schemes.  Thank goodness they just happened to have those snazzy `pulse' guns on hand.  Goodness knows what they would have done without them.
