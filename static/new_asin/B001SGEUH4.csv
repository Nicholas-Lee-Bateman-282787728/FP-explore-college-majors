3785440,3,B001SGEUH4,"Joe Spinell is in good form here, playing a celebrity-obsessed misfit who fantasizes about making it big in film and with his favorite star.  I liked the street scenes from Cannes and the cameo appearances.  However, it's ultimately not too different from others of this genre (see The Stunt Man and The Player).  Spinell was better in Maniac.",1253750400,,343,4.879310344827586
3785441,4,B001SGEUH4,"Insane guerilla filmmaking at its finest!

I'm still not over the last Troma release I reviewed, ""Getting Lucky"", but that's an ENTIRELY different review which I encourage you to check out for your self.  In terms of ""The Last Horror Film"" I must give it 4 stars only because the print and transfer are relatively poor (the rarity of this film should be considered, however).  That said, if you want to enjoy this film--which IS highly enjoyable--I suggest you purchase this DVD as it is unlikely that an improved version will be available for quite some time.

In terms of the film proper, it may even outshine ""Maniac"" as a vehicle for Joe Spinnel's acting prowess and its representation of maniacle obsessiveness.  The suspence is coupled with a film-within-a-film playfulness that may have provided inspiration for films such as Wes Craven's ""Scream.""  Stylistically, this film shines as it plays on the conventions of the traditional slasher films while adding its own iconography (you must see Spinnel dressed in drag or touching himself with the starlet's image projected on his bare chest to understand) ...

Those who enjoy finding that hidden gem should flock to this title.  It's very difficult not to have fun watching this film.  It's also nice to have the option of skipping Llyod Kaufman's introduction, which provides nothing more than boring fluff.  The extras are sufficient with an introducing ""conversation"" with one of Spinnel's closest friends, trailers, and a director's commentary.

Fans of 70s/80s cult films should add this film to their collections, just remember that the DVD transfer/print is below average.",1251072000,11,1636,5.1358490566037736
3785442,2,B001SGEUH4,"I bought The Last Horror Film without having even seen it first, because of the good reviews. I'm a huge slasher movie fan, so usually if others like a slasher movie I will too. Sadly, I didn't like The Last Horror Film. It has three things going for it: Caroline Munro, the awesome music, and a surprise ending. Everyone else from the script to the low body count is a bore. If you want to see a fun slasher movie starring Caroline Munro, rent Slaughter High instead.",1249948800,3,468,4.390804597701149

3785445,5,B001SGEUH4,"Brilliant!  Don't let the trailer fool you.  This is a classic horror masterpiece.  Joe Spinell does not disappoint, and this might be one of the most disturbing movies you ever see.

Spinell plays the compelling part of Vinny the deadbeat cabdriver - he lives with his mother and stalks a moviestar named Jana Bates.  He tries to approach her directly in Cannes, but he is always turned away.

Meanwhile, a mysterious killer slaughters all of Jana's coworkers and friends, building suspense and pointing towards Vinny...

And when you finally find out what's really going on, you'll find out that the previous parts of the movie were totally worth it.  BUY THIS MOVIE.",1245196800,3,669,4.910714285714286

3785447,5,B001SGEUH4,"""The Last Horror Film"" aka ""Fanatic"", is about a taxi driver from New York named Vinny who's obsessed with the famous actress, Jana Bates. He leaves his mother after getting up money to go to the Cannes Film Festival to try and get her into a moie that he wrote, the only problem is he can't get to her. Now what do you do in a situation where you're obsessed with an actress but you can't get close because of heavy security? Go to anyone associated with her. He comes in contact with many people around her including her ex-husband, agent, producer, and others. And wadya know, they all turn up dead, starting with Jana's ex and director, but no one does much about the deaths because they think they're all just part of a joke. Now that everyone around her is dead Jana is free for Vinny's taking and it all comes down to the superior ending!

This film is great! It's definantly not your typical independent film. It's more! Alot more! You see the main character Vinny start to slowly crack and descend into complete madness. He calls his mother from time to time and breaks down. This film has less gore but more story than ""Maniac"". Definantly worth checking out, I recomend it to anyone.",1240272000,7,1194,4.477064220183486
3785448,5,B001SGEUH4,"I am a huge fan of classic cult films, and The Last Horror Film is a must for anyone else that is a fan of such films as well. A guy named Vinny basically is obsessed with an actress that he desires to be a part of his own film. This crazed fan doesn't exactly win her over, and people around her start to dying, one after another. Definately not your borring, let alone average, indie flick from the 80's!",1240185600,4,406,4.0875
3785449,4,B001SGEUH4,"Wowzers its been a long time since I have seen this film. I was excited when I learned this was coming to blu-ray. This is a horror film that stands out for its time period. The main reason this film shines is specifically because of the actor Joe Spinell. Joe acts his butt off in this film. This besides Maniac is his finest performance of insanity. This is a film mixed with that violent nature of old school horror films, and everything you would expect in a film tilted, The Last Horror Film.

The plot is a basic style of horror film of the 80s, a stalker, stalking a girl. This time around a taxi driver named Vinny is stalking a beautiful actress who is part of the Cannes Film Festival. Meanwhile many of her friends are being violently killed. Blood, gore, lots of screams and violence lead you into a world of horror 80s classic style, with pure B-horror entertainment.

Directed by David Winters. Winters is a producer, actor, director, writer, musical department, and an all-around guru of film making. He is a director that adventured into many styles of entertainment from documentary, to horror, to many styles. He has away with bringing low budget cinema to the front of entertainment. He has produced tons of films, and also has acted in many films. I think The Last Horror Film is his shining film, or at least the one I like the most, and return to. An actor since 1943 and has directed all the way up to the present, 2015.

I have often felt this was an underrated slasher film forgotten by time. Thankfully TROMA has brought this out on a worthy blu-ray. From Decapitations, disemboweling, axe attacks and so much more. Did I mention tons of nudity.

The Last Horror Film is a mix of Drive-In Style B-movie entertainment. This is one of those horror films packed full of violence, screams, cheesy wonderful entertainment. A pure old school 80s B-grade horror at its best. The beautiful Caroline Munro playing the obsession of Joe Spinnells character Vinny. Both equal perfection woven around an often darker eroticism, splashed with blood.

Extras: 4/5

Like most all of TROMAs releases they jam pack there blu-rays with countless little goodies. Features, interviews, commentaries and so on. This release like all their others is a fine example of supplying extras to fans that fork out the hard earned cash for these products. Now like most of the special features supplied on these blu-ray releases, most have nothing to do with the film itself, its more or less the special features play homage to TROMA, and geared to TROMA fiends. As the blu-ray states, this film is newly restored, and also features the music of Depeche Mode.

The Special Features are:
The Return of one of TROMAs most beloved characters, Dolphin-man.
New Intro by Lloyd Kaufman (President of TROMA Entertainment and creator of The Toxic Avenger)
Audio Commentary. Which is a really good listen.
Highlights from 2015 Tromadance Film Festival
Mr. Robbie (A Short Film by Buddy Giovinazzo (Combat Shock) starring Joe Spinell)
A Full Episode of TROMAs latest web-series Kabukiman Cocktail Corner starring Paul Booth
Trailers

Audio/Video: 4/5

For the most part the film looks good. There are some moments where you can tell the film had problems, the transfer is not perfect, but looks better than it has ever been. These type of movies have never been given the proper treatment in the first place, so you should expect some moments of imperfection. Comparing this to my old VHS copy, and DVD copy, and dare I say a bootleg copy, this has never looked any better. Comparing it to those three realities, I think this has a fantastic audio and video presentation. The sound quality is ear candy, and the imagery is vibrant in color compared to all other existing outlets.

Overall:

If you have never seen this, don't go into this wanting an Oscar Worthy film, go into this wanting some classic 80s violence, blood, nudity laced, cheesy Drive-In entertainment, and then you won't be let down. Old school violence. Perfection in 80s horror trash. TROMA did a lovely job in bringing out an 80s gem on a new high class product that stands out. This is worth the gold forked out for it. Horror fans, Spinell fans. TROMA fans. This is classic 80s horror on a lovely new blu-ray.

3785454,4,B001SGEUH4,"I was lucky enough to be cast in this film and had great fun with all of the cast and crew. As most independent films, this one struggled with money. Much of the film was shot with ends, causing many headaches with color matching, etc. Big battle occurred between David Winters and his Producers as to who owned the film and who controlled the editing and final product.

David fled to London taking all of the film he could. Between there and New York, he was able to shoot enough 2nd unit footage to craft a story in editing, one almost completely different than the original script. It was a true masterpiece in how to create a film when 1/3 of the script wasn't filmed. It won the French horror film of the year award when it was released.",1391817600,5,743,4.345323741007194
3785455,4,B001SGEUH4,"Let me preface by saying that I adore the late Mr. Spinell (Rocky I&II, Taxi Driver, The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver, and MANIAC!). And judging by various documentaries on Joe Spinell, he was well loved by many people. His friends speak kindly and fondly of him as an entertainer, person and friend. I have a feeling that he was larger than life in real life; his early passing is a shame.

  With all of that being said, I have to judge a product fairly. My Spinell bias aside, this is not a fantastic horror film by any means. On the other hand, it's not terrible either. In some ways it actually falls into the ""so bad, it's good"" category, as many beloved cult films do. If you enjoyed Spinell's performance in Maniac, then I highly recommend this (previously obscure) little film. But if you are unfamiliar with his work, I'd say watch William Lustwig's ""Maniac"" first. Is it fair to compare Maniac and The Last Horror Film? I think it is, as Spinell's ""Vinny"" of TLHF is very much in the same vein of Maniac's ""Frank."" Though as much as the characters are similar, there are differences too. It seems that Spinell relishes playing the deranged guy so much that he actually treads the fine line of parody in this film. Maybe it is intentional, as there are comedic elements to TLHF? The meat of what I am trying to convey is that this is basically camp. I do not see it being appreciated by all. Maniac, though uneven in its thematic elements and story-line (The Anna and Frank romance is jarring to the vibe of the film), is a fairly unsettling and frightening film, despite the fact that it was made in 1980. Though The Last Horror Film was made a few years later, it feels far more dated and nonchalant than Maniac. In some ways, The Last Horror Film plays slight homage to the giallo film genre (Argento, Fulci, etc.). There are twists and all in all, I'd call this a ""fun"" horror film; it's nothing to be taken too seriously.

  I understand that the poor transfer is due to piecing the film together as best as they could in order to deliver the full film to us, but the overall film experience is dulled. Certain scenes are extremely dark (literally) and blurry/GRAINY. And other scenes either feature lines throughout the film or shaking. It's almost as if watching a VHS tape on DVD. If you've ever seen the uncut ""Silent Night, Deadly Night,"" you'll get an idea of what I am speaking of.

There are extras included and they are great. ""My favorite Maniac"" is a (very) free form documentary featuring Joe anecdotes via a longtime friend; it's touching and humorous.",1355961600,,2582,4.539784946236559
3785456,3,B001SGEUH4,"My girlfriend knew I liked cult horror films and picked this film up for me as a Christmas gift. I had seen previews of it and read many positive reviews, but hadn't gotten around to seeing it. I watched it recently and found it to be good, but feel it could have been better.

Joe Spinell is amazing in this movie. I don't think anybody can pull of the creepy loner quite like he can. The way Spinell gestures, speaks and moans...a true master at his character. At times you think he really is this person and not playing a part. The gore effects are really good in this as well, classic 80's style. A lot of the ""deaths"" are shots of films being shown at the Cannes Film Festival which is a cool effect.

Joe plays Vinny, a man obsessed with a horror film actress named Jenna Bates (played by Caroline Munro) that he wants to put in his movie. He feels that she is being misused and believes he has the perfect part for her to play. He tries to get through to her, but is continually shunned by everyone. The only other person Vinny seems to care about is his mother (who is in fact, played by Joe's real life mother) who he calls often. She tells him to give up on his crazy dreams, but he is determined to show her and everyone else his genius.

As the film progresses, it begs the question as to who is the killer. Is it Vinny, who keeps stalking the actress and everyone associated with her, or is it someone else? There are a lot of creepy shots of Vinny stalking her (shown in black and white and accompanied by very sinister heavy breathing) as well as some extremely disturbing shots of Vinny having nervous psychotic breakdowns.

There are however, some flaws with this film. The acting (aside from Spinell) is poor even by horror movie standards. Quite a few shots seem to have very little purpose besides making the film a few minutes longer. There are many places where the films slows down and it can get pretty boring. It picks up around the 45 minutes mark and from then on the film really gets exciting. Some of the footage is also very dark, making it hard to see what exactly is going on. I know some of this footage is restored and of poor quality, so I can forgive it since it makes the film complete. I might be nitpicking this, but I really did NOT enjoy the ""twist"" ending.

All in all, this is a good cult film that I think many will enjoy this and true horror fans should check out. It's not the best, but it certainly is worth a look.",1303948800,,2462,4.263383297644539

8339734,3,B001SGEUH4,"Joe Spinell is always great when he plays lunatics. He was the perfect on-screen crazy man. Joe's performance in The Last Horror Film was certainly top notch, but I found the script itself quite inadequate overall. There's just not much of interest going on here, and the twist ending is flat out ridiculous. I suppose that's why this movie is labeled a ""horror comedy""... because the ending's so dumb, it makes the whole production seem like a total joke in retrospect. Caroline Munro does a competent job, but the story tends to make her more of a plot-point than an actual character. Caroline's not really given much to do... and while she's a very beautiful woman, her weirdo skunk hairdo unfortunately ruins most of her sex appeal. I'd only recommend this film for hardcore Spinell or Munro fans... and ONLY if you've already seen most of their other work.",1524441600,,861,4.785234899328859
