Thay stay in the eucolyptus tree in her yard. They go on all kinds of fun adventures. Your kids will love this show, and want to watch it again and again.",1219622400,,316,3.953125
439114,3,6302230918,Gary Busey just didn't get the job done trying to imitate Bear Bryant.  Still the facts were accurate as far as I know so the movie was worth a watch.,1393891200,2,150,4.0

439116,3,6302230918,"Okay, we watched the DVD last night.  I have to say that the transfer of this movie to DVD is mediocre at best.  It looks like the transfer was made from a theatrical print as you can see the scratches and reel changes from human contact with the print.  The color is also faded as if the print had been sitting for some time.  I was worried that I had purchased a bootlegged copy as the DVD has a sticky label attached, and the cover is a photocopy.  After watching the DVD, it looks as though someone was able to purchase the print, get it into a computer, compress it for DVD, and then market it for sale by duplicating it as he/she sells them.  For the price, it is not worth it unless you are a true fan of the movie as it seems to be the only available place to get any copy on DVD.

Still, the film was a special gift for the wife (who grew up in Tuscaloosa and had met the Bear).  The real treasure here was discovering the film once again, dated as it is.  I wish someone with resources (I'm talking to you Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Lucas) would take charge and restore this movie for a proper DVD/Blu-ray release.  This is one of Gary Busey's greatest performances.  You know, before he jumped into the deep end of the pool before knowing how to swim.

Finally, this is a movie that could really use an update.  The story wanders through Bear's life without sticking to any particular season of greatness or really covering what he meant to the college outside of a few moments in the film.  I would like to see this story get the ""Lincoln"" treatment.  Take a few years of Bryant's life at Alabama where he was struggling and show how he built the National Championship dynasty.

Again, my wife still love's it.  I guess that is the important thing.  However, if a Blu-ray is ever marketed for this movie, I will read EVERY review before I purchase.",1357516800,4,1854,4.278735632183908
439117,1,6302230918,"I waited 20 years to see ""The Bear.""  It was in the theaters a very short time.  The movie is an insult to the memory of Coach Bryant, and the Universit of Alabama.  You will waste your time and money if you get this DVD.",1356480000,,221,3.8666666666666667

439119,3,6302230918,"Does anyone know where I can find the whole series of this cartoon? I remember watching it as a kid and being absolutely fascinated by some of it's concepts. It's one of the earliest shows I can remember watching with a pretty decent story arch than ran through the series (especially late in the series where it got into some pretty heavy drama about dimensional merging). A lot of the early Nickelodeon cartoons where way ahead of their time in that regard and sadly, it's seems that children's programming has simply devolved into babysitting our collective ADHD kids with either total immaturity or repeating basic preschool concepts in an attempt to educate.

Let's bring back shows like this that can really stimulate a child's mind (with subtle quantum theory). And yes, I am still talking about the Noozles, don't let the dopey VHS box art fool you. This show was deep.",1349740800,4,877,4.80794701986755
439120,3,6302230918,"While we enjoyed the movie, we are Crimson Tide fans, the quality of the DVD was not great.  The label, package and the DVD appear to be home made.",1333065600,,147,4.068965517241379
439121,3,6302230918,"As an Alabama fan, I must say the DVD is enjoyable.  It has quite a bit of original footage incorporated in the film.  Technically speaking, the DVD transfer is poor, considerable amount of ""noise"" in the video and the audio is advertised as Dolby, but does not come across in that fashion.  If one views this DVD on HD equipment as I did, the defects are amplified.  On a positive note, the story is compelling and having experienced much of Crimson Tide history in my younger years, it was a pleasurable walk down memory lane.  I realize this film has been significantly difficult to find, so with that said, I guess the producer/seller justifies the price.",1319068800,3,659,4.646551724137931
439122,3,6302230918,"Have not seen this film--don't think anyone has. It got mediocre reviews and bombed. It was released just days before the sudden tragic death of Jon-Erik Hexum. Producers immediately withdrew the film, announcing that they were going to restore all of Hexum's deleted scenes and re-release the film. This never happened--the film just dissapeared. Hexum's only film, unfortunately--Enormously talented, likeable and incredibly attractive, he was obviously on the verge of a major career.",1310688000,2,487,5.684931506849315
439123,5,6302230918,"Hi!

I accidentally mixed this seller up with a seller who didn't ship my item. This seller was GREAT! They saved me from a bad seller and they even walked me thru correcting my mistake.

They care about they're reputation and were very forgiving.

Oh, the product??? Yeah, my dad loved it. He's been watching yogi bear nonstop!

Thanks again,

7822648,5,6302230918,"Without a doubt the greatest film about Bear Bryant starring Gary Busey ever made. Sure, Alfred Hitchcock never winning an Academy Award for Best Director is a big snub, but The Bear lost the 1985 Best Picture race to Amadeus. I mean, Amadeus is okay, but he ever beat Tennessee eleven years in a row? I didn't think so. Five stars for Gary Busey and The Bear (not the be confused with the 1988 French film by the same title about a literal bear also played by Gary Busey I think)",1444003200,,480,4.285714285714286

Later, when we tried to purchase a copy of it, we were told that the Bryant family ""pulled"" it from circulation.  Evidently, they were displeased with certain aspects regarding the portrayal of their father.  So when I found this movie on Amazon, I was very happy!
