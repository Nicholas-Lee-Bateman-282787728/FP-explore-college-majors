8072160,1,B000A1ILB4,"I bought this because i thought it looked good..... how wrong could i have been! It was torture to watch to the end, i kept wanting to turn
it off but thought the plot might improve.  It is now in the charity bin, i even feel guilty about that as someone else may buy it also thinking it
good! Boring!!!!!!",1350518400,,306,4.1
8072161,2,B000A1ILB4,"***  spoilers ahead  *** as somebody else has already commented on, peter gallagher's character was beyond weak. if i'm ever asked to do a director's cut on this the end of the movie would be juliet destroying doofus head and his lamo family for 20 minutes and then blowing up the entire city as punishment for being crap. also, they overplayed the character in the wheelchair and his longing to be free!?!? big time. the message seemed to be if you're in a wheelchair even if you've got a great job and great friends then you're life is incomplete and should be escaped from at the first opportunity - crass and dumb. just to add salt to the wounds apparently when juliet uploads she is no longer who she once was - she is a pale copy, a chimera and this existential knowledge helps to destroy. however when wheelchair boy uploads it is beautiful and has made him ""free"" and complete and better than he was. meh.",1302998400,,913,4.461077844311378
8072162,2,B000A1ILB4,"OBSERVATIONS ON THIS MOVIE:

*It's way too long and can't sustain suspense or interest for such a length.

*A preposterous plot that never comes near to being credible.

*Peter Gallagher's character is entirely unlikeable; he does one stupid thing after another and is unfair to both his wife, Mimi Rogers, and the siren Juliet Spring (Bridgette Nelson Sampras).

*Why would anyone not see how manipulative and selfish Nelson's character is?

*The scene where Mimi Rogers throws the head is either intentionally or unintentionally hilarious.

Director Mick Garris usually does better work (he's done many of the Stephen King tv adaptations) than this.

Worth a rental if you have two and a half hours you can't possibly find anything better to do with.",1152403200,2,752,5.114754098360656
8072163,1,B000A1ILB4,"I might have enjoyed this movie, if some one, any one! other then Bridgette Wilson played the part of Juliet Spring.

In my opinion those swelled, puckered, oversized lips were a big distraction from the movie. All I could focus on was that mouth of hers, which I thought was beyond weird and freaky looking.

Those adnormal looking lips just creeped me out so much, I lost interest in the movie.",1151884800,3,396,4.563380281690141
8072164,5,B000A1ILB4,"Virtual Obsession is a movie that poses all the big questions in life such as, `what if you can download your brain into a computer?' Or `What happens when a married professor hires a hot, young and dying scientist to work in his lab?'

The only scientific thing that makes sense throughout this movie is the chemistry between the Professor and his hot, young and dying research assistant. Not to mention she's dying which makes it all the more intense. `Professor, I can't die and not have ever made love to you'. Who can deny someone their dying wish?

Now let's not forget the Professor's wife who is one third part of this love triangle. After meeting the hot, young and dying scientist, alarm bells go off and they keep getting louder. From the moment she catches a whiff of perfume on his shirt, to the discovery of the love poem and finally, (my favourite part) when she finds the head of the `other woman' in her freezer.

While critics have drawn parallels between Virtual Obsession and Space Odyssey 2001, I feel that Virtual Obsession is able to rely on its own merits. A bittersweet and moving tale about love, temptation and off course, science.",1138752000,8,1158,4.639024390243902
