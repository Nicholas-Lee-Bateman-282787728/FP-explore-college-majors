8374249,4,B002MYELOS,"This is quite an enjoyable documentary that takes you on a journey around the 9/11 truth movement.

It is unusual for a film like this to made by a British Director, but he has done a reasonable job in getting some interesting footage, particulary getting to speak with Cynthia McKinney on her trip to London.

It starts with a look at some activists in UK/Europe, unfortunately it comes over as he is fighting a losing battle, in his attempt to get the 9/11 truth to the British public.  Yes, Blair & Co. have done an equally good job on us, as Bush did to the US.

The film then moves to the US, this is by far the best part as he gets to speak with W Rodriguez, First Responders, US 9/11 truth activists and films Alex Jones during various events.  He gets to the many issues around 9/11 that are being ignored or covered up by the US government.  The piece with First Responder John Feal is excellent, highlighting the suffering still happening as a result of 9/11.

Some of the footage you will have seen before if you follow Alex Jones films, and the style of the film is similar to a Jones production, which is no bad thing.

This is a decent introduction to 9/11 truth, as it gets its message across in a balanced and respectful way.  Its encouraging people are now realising the mainstream media and governments are working together to feed us untruths.",1264982400,2,1362,4.437751004016064
