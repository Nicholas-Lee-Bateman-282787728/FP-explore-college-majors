8256219,5,B0014SPNDQ,"Seth and Tyler set out to be the first to drive the Pan American Highway from northern Alaska to southern Argentina without using a drop of gasoline.  Instead, they fuel their truck with vegetable and animal oils that are readily available.  Along the way, they attract plenty of attention and talk with curious onlookers about alternative energy while kayaking some of the planet's most challenging rivers. This snappily edited video/travelogue educates and entertains with plenty of humor.  The kayaking scenes are awesome!",1232582400,,525,5.378048780487805
