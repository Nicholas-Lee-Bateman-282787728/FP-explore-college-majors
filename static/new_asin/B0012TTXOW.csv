3098794,5,B0012TTXOW,"The first time I watched this couple was really impressed with their outstanding
acting. What a professional work by this actor and actress.
I do recommend any movie or drama where they are the main actors.
""One more Chance"" is an excellent movie, a very good script with the acting
of the most romantic couple in the Filipino movie industry.",1361836800,,342,4.716666666666667

8247794,5,B0012TTXOW,I loved this series! So funny at times. Really good acting. A must see!,1487980800,,71,4.142857142857143
8247795,5,B0012TTXOW,Loved the story. Glad that I didn't let the title scare me away. Very satisfying series.,1470355200,,88,4.5625

8247797,5,B0012TTXOW,"Its you're average k-rom-com with a happy ending. I'm not really ruining it because its called ""one more happy ending"" after all. I like the different stories of the 4 women. They covered some serious topics along with your normal girly screaming heroin who is a working girl but some how manages to always look perfectly made up.",1469059200,,330,4.706896551724138

8247799,2,B0012TTXOW,Better then your average ordinary Western but not by much. It does seem to start off slow but by the middle of the movie it does start to pick up & the action begins. It also gets a little boring at times but the action scenes kinda make up for it. George Peppard is the best thing about One More Train To Rob. If he wasn't in it then the movie would've been completely dull,1432080000,,374,4.0
8247800,4,B0012TTXOW,"One More Train to Rob (1971) starts out a bit dull, on the average side. It is slow-going and the direction is really not motivated. I really didn't think it would amount to anything, and it doesn't, still, it is barely above average and will get you to the end. What helps it along is the acting of the actors, reliables like George Peppard, Soon-Tek Oh (Missing in Action 2 (1985)), John Vernon (Animal House (1978 )), Diana Muldaur, etc. They aren't that good and the script is nothing to goggle over, but still, seeing familiar acting faces helps.

Hal Needham (frequent collaborator with Burt Reynolds) is in it.

George Peppard plays a train bandit who gets caught and sent to prison. He comes back to find his old crew has changed and wants to get rid of him. Some absurd action scenes ensue and then it ends.

In all, it is rather mild and not very engaging, but it's something to see on a rainy night.",1430352000,,910,4.437125748502994
