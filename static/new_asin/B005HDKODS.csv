It's got some awesome humor in it and it also touches base on some very interesting points.  Jack Lord has been a fan of ours since we first started watching Hawaii 5-0 (the 70s TV series).  Watching him in here isn't much different, except he's riding a lot more and it's different scenery.  If you like watching old westerns, you'll love this series, too.  The only thing that I don't like, is that it didn't last for more seasons. Otherwise, I love it.",1342224000,,554,4.288461538461538
4699135,5,B005HDKODS,"I remember this series from back in the day and recall thinking Jack Lord was more than attractive.  In fact, I thought he was kinda cute!!!  This series was my first and only exposure to rodeo and rodeo riders.  The stories are more than good, they are believable and make you wish there were more people in the world like Stoney and his down home friends who stick up for each other and for people who wander thorugh their lives.
Too bad Stoney never got the gold buckle as champion bronc rider, which was his goal.
The quality of the films themselves leaves something to be desired but you are warned about that at the beginning so, should be no real problem there.  The acting is pretty good considering a lot of the characters are near the beginning of their careers and still honing their craft. The scripts can seem a little stilted and stiff, but this was a different time and there were more checks in place.
This was a good launching pad for Jack Lord who, after this series, found his place on Hawaii Five-0 where the rest is history.
No sex, no graphic violence (a few fist fights but no gunfire), no drug use (though there is some beer drinking but not by Stoney).  Takes you back to a more innocent time.  My bottom line advice, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1342224000,,1276,4.385593220338983
4699136,5,B005HDKODS,"When I was a child, this was my favorite show on tv. And I had a little girl crush on Stoney Burke. My brother even had an old hat, that he called his Stoney Burke hat. Great memories. These are old bw shows from the early 60s  They are wonderful to watch. Love them.",1334966400,2,267,3.9444444444444446
4699137,5,B005HDKODS,"I love the series. I have watched 9 of them and the stories are very believable and well written. Jack Lord's acting is superb and convincing. He plays a cowboy in the rodeo circuit well. It is packed with interesting stories which teach us about morality, clean living, conscience and doing the right thing. I just love Jack Lord in this. He is as handsome as ever - for all Jack Lord fans. My only disappointment is the lack of clarity in quality of the film. There are many dark patches throughout. The dvd does advise that due to the age of the film the quality of it suffers.

I rate it 5 star for content
I rate it 2.5 star for quality of picture. I would love it remastered.",1328832000,8,681,4.2384615384615385
4699138,1,B005HDKODS,"Bad product. Dvd quality was terrible to watch. Looks like it was copied from an old VHS tape. Blurry and out of focus. I would be embarrassed to sell such a poor quality DVD. It's a shame, because Stoney Burke was one of my favorite shows growing up.",1328313600,7,251,4.25
4699139,5,B005HDKODS,"This series is among the very best ever and has never gotten its proper acclaim.  It was well written, well casted, well acted, and had a great musical score.  It had expert consultation on the rodeo business and was therefore realistic.

Individual episodes stand alone, but there was the underlying theme of Stoney's quest for The Gold Buckle (Saddle Bronc Champion) throughout the one-season run.  As the series wound down, he did not get the buckle and it left you hanging for the next season, which never happened.

Part of the lack of recognition for this series (and probably the main reason for it) is that it is repeatedly mislabeled as a western.  What a bunch of bull!  It was a modern-day drama that happened to be set to the backdrop of the rodeo circuit.  It was not a western.

This box set does not comprise quite half of the series.  I wish I could get my hands on the whole series.  There were thirty-some episodes.  Why don't the DVD producers focus on getting this series out, rather than the garbage they now peddle?",1321142400,14,1037,4.576086956521739

8472828,5,B005HDKODS,"Compelling stories, interesting characters, fine acting. Who could ask for anything more? I would pass on this one if black and white isn't your thing.",1360972800,,151,5.08
8472829,5,B005HDKODS,Jack Lord is the ONLY Steve McGarrett as far as I'm concerned. So - picking up his earlier works to see what he had done.,1360454400,,121,3.88
8472830,2,B005HDKODS,The quality of the episodes was really really bad.  Daytime scenes looked like night time.  Sometimes figures were barely visible on inside shots.  The quality of the videos was rated 8 out of 10.  It was more like 3 out of 10.,1360022400,,227,4.333333333333333

8472833,5,B005HDKODS,"One of my early favorite TV shows and  difficult to find is STONEY BURKE. I was surprised  to find it at Amazon, and no where  else. The black and white episodes  were  always sharp and fast moving. Sure, you had to have a hero that would show up like Superman, yet here you had a Rodeo group of regular cowboy good guys that handled  events on and off the rodeo circuit. Jack Lord went on to make  another great TV  series, but this early one I say..was his best. It also had true rodeo stars in character parts. Too bad we can't find all of the episodes.",1346803200,,556,4.130841121495327
