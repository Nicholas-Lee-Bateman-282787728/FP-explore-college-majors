4233740,3,B003ZHDREQ,"This DVD set was purchased not only for my 4-year-old son to watch, but for me to watch as well. I read the reviews on Amazon before committing to the purchase, so I had a basic idea of what we'd be getting. My son likes the shows, but he's not overly excited and anxious to watch the entire series. Even for a 4-year-old, I think some of the slapstick comedy becomes corny at best. For example, the show that has the squad go up against Dormmamu also features Dr Strange, who's way too wacky and off-kilt (regardless the underlying factor).

I do like seeing all the different heroes and villains. I'm hoping we continue to see even more supporting characters in the show (we're on episode 7).

If you have a child who likes Marvel, but is too young for something like the Earth's Mightiest Heroes: Avengers Assemble, this may be a decent option... that's if you/he/she can get past the esoteric humor.",1334448000,,903,4.533742331288344
4233741,3,B003ZHDREQ,"As a 30 year old adult, I found this cartoon to be somewhat witty and fun, although definitely geared toward children. However, I found a lot of the language, story lines and underlying themes to be a bit worrisome, at least for my 4 year old son. Not that I expected the show to be Barney, it is after all about super heros and fighting, but there are definitely moments where the tone is decidedly geared more toward adults than young children. Your kids may pick up some language that you might rather them not have! My 3 yr old son ran around saying ""Don't be Cocky kid"" for weeks after hearing Wolverine say it. For some parents this type of language may not be an issue, but if it is...beware!",1330473600,,699,4.343511450381679
4233742,5,B003ZHDREQ,"The characters have great personality, the artwork is colorful and attractive, and the storylines are unexpectedly clever. I bought it for my under age 7 boys, and find myself watching every episode.",1286582400,4,199,5.25

8410295,4,B003ZHDREQ,"When this cartoon premiered a few years ago, I balked at first-although I`m an avid fan of superhero animation, I thought Super Hero Squad would be cutesy and cloying. Careful viewing proved me wrong. The characters are presented as fairly true to their Marvel counterparts, and the storylines are absorbing and action-packed, with a healthy dose of humor.  Much of the humor comes from head villain Dr. Doom. Though he`s menacing in the comic books, he`s more of the classic bumbling enemy here, much like the Monarch from the Venture Brothers show.

The heroes are also a lot of fun: you get to see their contrasting personalities as they both do battle and play together. Iron Man is usually the leader, but everyone gets some spotlight time. As others have noted, SHS works on both kid and adult levels. I can see this in operation when we watch it with my nephew ( and luckily his favorite the Hulk gets a lot of face time).  Settling down for a marathon of the show is truly something to look forward to!",1360022400,,1010,4.6
8410296,5,B003ZHDREQ,This cartoon series is one of the greatest for keeping nieces and nephews entertained.  The characters are now defined in more of the way a five year old thinks and the jokes are on the same level of wit as Rocky and Bullwinkle thereby making the show just as enjoyable for grownups.,1350950400,,283,4.4423076923076925
8410297,4,B003ZHDREQ,"Since the writing and art style of this show appeared to be targeted at kids, I bought this for my 5-year-old nephew who is really into superheroes. I'm in my 30's and have been a lifelong Marvel fan as well, so I've watched quite a few of these with him. Yes, the humor is a bit corny, and characters are very simplified for the younger audience. And yet I found myself chuckling quite a bit. I thought it was amusing to see these characters, sometimes taken so seriously in other media, broken down into caricatures of themselves. Both me and my nephew enjoy watching these, appreciating them on two different levels.

This includes both Volumes 1 & 2, and is a better value than buying them separately.",1349913600,6,705,4.551181102362205
8410298,5,B003ZHDREQ,"This is a great show for younger children. My two boys, ages five and four, love superheros, but aren't going to the real Avengers movie (yet...because of the ""drug references""), so this is a great alternative. I find it to be very kid-friendly and quite entertaining.",1336867200,,268,4.8478260869565215
