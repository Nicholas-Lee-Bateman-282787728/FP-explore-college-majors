Tahiry is to die for, I really like her coyness, very soft character.  I'd love to see the continuation of this, I wonder if her character is as innocent as she seems.  This would make a great series with a bigger budget. Starz would be a great place for it.  The forensic psychologist story line could play out for a while with different interludes from different people's lives.",1455667200,,520,4.26530612244898

5901348,5,B009WS9O3K,"Ok. I'm pretty sure the movie was not supposed to be funny but from the acting, the camera shaking, and the fake fighting especially with the toy props I died laughing. I mean it was a low budget low budget film. The story line was horrible as well. I mean I get the message they were trying to convey but it was overkill. I mean it was just bad and I wish the actors the best of luck because these are the kinds of films and scripts that could destroy your career before it began.

8603633,3,B009WS9O3K,"Stretching to give it three stars. Can get past the low budget, but these directors REALLY need to work on their transitions.  The stories are good lessons, but the scenes do not flow at all.  Some actors should have been given more PT than others.

This however was a train wreck. You know you should look away, but you just can't. I can't tell you it's a waste of your time. I can say if you enjoy that feeling of WTF did I just watch? or you have watched every other movie you could find and read the corresponding books, or maybe you have 2 hours you just want to give away?Then this is your movie.",1498435200,,561,4.008928571428571

8603638,2,B009WS9O3K,"I try my best to give these low budget movies made by black filmmakers the benefit of the doubt. However even with a limited budget it is possible to have better sets, a better story and better acting. Clifton Powell appeared for perhaps 10 minutes and was given top billing because he is a somewhat recognizable name along with the actress from the Players Club. A few goodoments but overall this gets a thumbs down.",1486598400,,417,4.573333333333333
