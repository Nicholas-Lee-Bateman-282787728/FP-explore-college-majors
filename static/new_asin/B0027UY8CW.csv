3868843,4,B0027UY8CW,"As for the series, Carl Sagan is a hero of mine for his ability to say thing that are so complex in a poetic and understandable way. The depths of his knowledge astounds me. thru the series he explains the world around us and helps whoever watches it realize how connected everything is.

*The issue I had was that I received the DVDs not realizing they are region 0 (should have figured since the seller is from the UK)

That was only a minor inconvenience for me. Since My computer was able to read the DVDs I converted all of the episodes to MP4. Then I placed them ALL on a one 16 gb flash drive (lost a little quality in compression to 16 GB)

Now I have the beautiful case to house the flash drive. so now I can plug into the my Blu-ray player and watch all of them without having to change the disc.

So in comparison to buying the series for $60 in the US. I spent like $18 on the dvds and $12 for the flash drive plus a little bit of my time I still saved $30",1389830400,19,968,4.0
3868844,3,B0027UY8CW,"Please note: This version is DVD Region Code '0'. Despite what is published on the internet for this region code, this version would not play in either my DVD or Bluray player.

3868848,5,B0027UY8CW,"First, this is NOT a minus.  If you live in the USA can't watch these DVDs on your TV, it's because you don't have the right DVD player.  I live in the good ol' USA and watch DVDs that come from all parts of the world.  That's because, years ago, I bought a region-free DVD player that will convert PAL to NTSC on the fly - allowing me to watch PAL DVDs on my US television set.  If you can't do the same thing, there are two ways to ""fix"" your problem:

1)  Go to the VideoHelp.com forum (it's free).  Mention the make and model number of your DVD player.  Some (but not all) DVD players can be turned into region-free players simply by entering a short sequence of codes using your player's remote control device.  Once those codes are entered, your player's ROM settings are changed permanently - allowing you to watch DVDs from anywhere in the world *forever*.  And it won't even cost you a dime.  Or ...

2)  If you are unlucky and don't have a player that can be modified with codes, type ""region-free DVD player"" into the search block right here at Amazon.  They have a bunch - most under $50 - and some that can upconvert the signal to 1080p quality.

Now, on the Cosmos set itself.  I edited this review from when I first posted it ... not knowing exactly how they arranged programs on the discs.  I originally thought I'd found a number of flaws but now realize I only found one.  At the end of episode 3, the credits are cut off prematurely.  That's it.  Otherwise, the set performs well and I'm very pleased with it.",1462320000,10,1528,4.294736842105263

3868850,5,B0027UY8CW,"Carl Sagan can't be beat for his no-nonsense, get real attitude for science and public opinion.  He, in essence says: ""Public, wake up and quit dreaming about god-images and appreciate the scientific method. Oh, and by the way, all the great science of the past that was worth anything, but got lost, was because of social inequities--society rose up and quashed slave owning Greece and lost it's marvels, taking centuries to rediscover them.""

He was also long on nuclear holocaust, being in the Cold War era.

However, it is a marvelous explanation of the cosmos and the history of science.  Who knew that people in Egypt knew the Earth was not only ""round"", but calculated its diameter--in 300B.C.??? Wow.",1461110400,3,708,4.92436974789916

3868861,2,B0027UY8CW,"It is mis-leading not to prominently display the PAL format instead of merely displaying DVD on the face of the offering. Buried deep in the details is the PAL format information, but that is not a go-to location when the expectation on seeing ""DVD"" on a American program is that it will be compatible with US DVD players.  Other than this, I am sure everything else would likely be fine. Based on other comments, this is a common mis-attribution caused by the lack of indication that the format is PAL on the product page.",1443571200,,523,4.5638297872340425

3868863,3,B0027UY8CW,"Carl Sagan's Cosmos is a classic. A beautiful piece of work. I was excited to find this on DVD and was even more excited to see that the seller proclaimed that it was a 0 (zero) DVD region code. But when I attempted to watch it in my DVD player, it would not play. It turns out that the discs are formatted for PAL signal. But most DVD players in the United States only play NTSC. My DVD player only plays NTSC. So I cannot play these discs in my DVD player. I really wish the sellers would have specified that very important fact. On the plus side, my laptop does play the discs so I'm not completely out of the money. Just inconvenienced.

Sound quality is excellent. I could listen to Carl Sagan all day. It's a pretty dated show (35 years old) so the video quality is low for today's standards. But that should be expected. And, in my opinion, it really doesn't matter that the images are pixelated at times or the visual effects appear to be low budget. All that just adds to the overall nostalgia of it all.

Overall happy with my purchase. Just wish the description with each individual seller would have specified PAL vs stating the region code, giving me false hope. I'm just happy it plays on my laptop.",1440028800,2,1213,4.3392070484581495

3868891,5,B0027UY8CW,"NOTE: These DVD discs really are ""Region: All Regions"" (aka Region 0, or Region Free) as claimed; BUT they are also ""Format: PAL"" (as claimed).

 DVD Regions: A distribution protection system that divides the world into Six Regions: 1)US & Canada; 2)Europe, Japan & MiddleEast; 3)Southeast Asia; 4)Latin America; 5)Russia, India, central Asia, most of Africa; and 6)China.

 Video Format, pre-HD (includes DVD and Videotape): The regular video formats in use around the world. The three main ones are:
 NTSC) US, Canada, Mexico, central America, Japan;
 SECAM) France, Russia, parts of Asia & Africa; and
 PAL) most of the rest of the world.

So the discs are All Region DVD, but Format still matters for any DVD (or videotape).  Thus you need a PAL-capable player and PAL-capable display to see this set of DVDs.

NOTE 2 (for other products)
 HD (blu-ray) is a world-wide format replacing NTSC/PAL/SECAM, so that issue goes away, But blu-ray does have its own distribution protection Regions: A/1) All of the Americas, Japan, southeast Asia; B/2) Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia; and C/3) Russia, India, China, central Asia.",1414800000,48,1132,5.164835164835165

According to Wikipedia,  ""As of 2009, it was still the most widely watched PBS series in the world.""  The concept was decades ahead of it's time - considering currently popular titles such as ""How the Universe Works,"" Stephen Hawking's, ""Into the Universe,"" and ""Through The Wormhole"" with Morgan Freeman.

Another book of Dr Sagan's, that made it to film, ""Contact,"" was also an exceptional story line that I find stands head and shoulders above the typical film and TV industry's monotonous, incessant line-up of cop shows, and so-called reality TV.

Imagine what not only the entertainment industry, but our world itself, would be like if the companies and corporations that act as the 'pimps' for the unmitigated cow-patties of cop/crime shows we're inundated with now, would sponsor programs that actually contributed something positive to our societies.  Is it any wonder social progress lags so far behind scientific and technological progress?

Fortunately, there is at least one bright light ahead.  Despite all the obstacles thrown out by the TV industry, original co-authors, Ann Druyan, and Steven Soter, as well as Seth MacFarlane have fought to produce a follow-up program to Cosmos, ""Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey,"" hosted by one of my personal favorite astrophysicist, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson.  It is scheduled to air on March 9, 2014 - that's only about two weeks away, but I can hardly wait !",1393459200,13,1595,5.123552123552123

8355144,3,B0027UY8CW,"CAUTION: The discs I bought for the Carl Sagan 1980 Cosmos won't play on U.S. players. I bought the discs on Amazon and there weren't any warnings, saying the discs weren't Region 1. Thats why I gave the original Cosmos (1980) three stars on Amazon. I had to play the series on a computer that recognizes all regions because they wouldnt work in any of my dvd players.

The series is terrific, as well as Carl Sagan.

I recommend buying Cosmos (2014) with Neil deGrasse Tyson. Cosmos (2014) with Neil Tyson builds on the original Cosmos (1980) with Carl Sagan. Ive seen Tyson in other astronomy shows and hes great.

If you love astronomy I also recommend the History channels The Universe (2007-2012) series, which I bought on discs, although the folding cardboard and plastic contraption the discs came in doesnt hold the discs very well.

If you like good space fiction you might like some of the following. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From the Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination. If you like those you might also like Manhattan (2014-2015), Granite Flats (2013-2015) or Taken (2002). All three series are set during WWII or shortly after. They are about secret government programs. Manhattan is about making the first atomic bomb, like the movie Fat Man and Little Boy (1989). Taken is about UFOs and alien visitors, sort of a fictionalized version of Project Blue Book. And Granite Flats is about the experimental drug program MKUltra (the CIA mind control program).

All of the above series have great story arcs. They start and finish strong and have great middles. One difference is the smoking and drinking. There is smoking and drinking in almost every scene in Manhattan, which was set during the era when soldiers received packs of cigarettes with their meal rations. Ever been around a chain smoker? In Taken theres a scene where Crawford says his doctor prescribed cigarettes for hypertension. Imagine that. I don't remember any smoking in Granite Flats, but that might just be my poor memory.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,3537,5.107266435986159
