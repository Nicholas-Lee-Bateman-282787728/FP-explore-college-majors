8120831,5,B000FCOIUQ,"This This original 9-hour, epic, Collector's Edition mini-series on 5-VHS tapes, is nothing short of spectacular! It is the sequel to JESUS OF NAZARETH another phenomenal mini-series that starts, where JESUS OF NAZARETH, left off. It depicts the birth, rise and expansion of the Early Christian Church in it's infancy, from right after the Crucifixion of Christ and on through the entire Book of Acts. And includes the horrific and unwarranted martyrdom of the Apostles: James, Peter and Paul. It details the infamous walk of the Risen Jesus with two of His followers on the Road to Emmaeus and features the conversion of the first Roman convert - Cornelius, and his entire household. Along with the intriguing life of the Roman Emperor Tiberius and his self-imposed exile on the beautiful but desolate Island of Capri and the unscrupulous succession of his grand-nephew Caligula, who was nothing short of insane. And of course, another featured highlight is the spectacular Baptism of and by the Holy Spirit on the 50th Day of Pentecost within the Upper Prayer Room, which is focused on and shown in great detail and is quite moving. As well as, the mighty conversion of a Jewish Pharisee named Saul, on the Road to Damascus to persecute new Christian converts and his dramatic encounter with the Lord that literally, through him off of his horse. Resulting in his temporal blindness followed by his radical conversion to Christianity complete with a name change, to that of Paul. Hence emerges the radically transformed Apostle Paul, the Holy Spirit inspired Author of three quarters of the New Testament. And this mini-series introduces Luke, the non-Jewish Physician from Philipi, Greece who decided to travel with the Apostle Paul, too witness and log the events of his life and the words and life of Jesus, as well. His efforts resulted in the writings known, as: The GOSPEL OF LUKE and the ACTS OF THE APOSTLES, which is also known as the BOOK OF ACTS, within the Holy Bible. Gospel Communications International, Inc. by way of Gospel Films, made this magnificent historically and spiritually accurate mini-series come to fruition. So that that audiences may know the New Testament aftermath of the Crucifixion and Ascension of Jesus Christ and how Christianity and even 'Christians' which is the Greek word for ""...Partisans with Christ..."" and how they lived, all came about. Although some dramatic license was taken, there is a great deal more of the Early Church beginnings with all of the birth pangs and a concise synopsis of the New Testament, to warrant 9-hours of your viewing time and the keeping of this absolutely brilliant portrayal of Early Christianity. It's dramatic, accurate, historical and very easy to watch. You don't have to be a biblical scholar to understand what's being shown. So, take the phone off of the hook, put out the 'Do Not Disturb' sign, relax and enjoy this unedited, full screen version of the brilliantly compiled A.D. mini-series which is entertaining, educational and spiritually enlightening.

8120833,4,B000FCOIUQ,"I saw this when it came out in 1985. I'm glad to be able to find it now. A.D. entertwines the stories of the Romans, Jews and Christians after the death of Jesus. A lot of research went into this miniseries and it's really a great production.

The Christains. While it doesn't follow the bible 100%, it's pretty close which makes it a delight to watch, bringing to life the book of Acts, making it so much easier to picture the events and filling in the gaps of what may have been.

The Romans. I'm no historian but based on what I know, it seems to follow Roman history pretty closely. I would say this part, the story of the Romans, is the most dramatic and well done from a cinematic point of view and would draw viewers who are not interested in seeing a biblical story.

The Jews. I don't know enough about Jewish history to comment and this story is the least fleshed out of the three. Deals a little with the Zealots, but we primarily see the Jewish peoples', Herod's and the religious leaders' reactions to Christianity and to a lesser degree their reaction to Roman rule.

Enjoyed watching this again with my spouse--first time, who loved it.",1217462400,3,1151,4.440758293838862

VHS tapes may be getting obsolete, but this set I think is worth collecting.",1207267200,5,245,4.083333333333333
