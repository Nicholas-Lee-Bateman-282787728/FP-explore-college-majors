3028986,5,B000YHQNCI,"Thank God (literally) for film makers,recently, who have gone out on a limb against the tide of religious fundamentalist non-thinking, and bring sanity,perspective and common sense as well as Biblical understanding to issues that seem to keep plaguing America (and Afghanistan it seems!).I was privileged to catch this at the arthouse in town yesterday, and found myself absorbed in this hour-and-a-half documentary about how five Evangelical families,including Dick Gephardt's,face the issues of homosexuality in their families. Some people may not care about this subject and some may out and out refuse to go, but much like another recent documentary ""No End in Sight"" which tackled a very sensitive and divisive issue on the Iraq War,now ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" brings a similar understanding,very fair,balanced,level-headed and fact-wielding that should not be offensive or polarizing, but rather informative,illuminating and ultimately healing. This film is for the thinking and inquisitive and thoughtful film-goer. This film serves as an excellent comparison film to 2006's Oscar-nominated ""Jesus Camp"" which I tell my story in review. I can only hope that this Film Festival Audience Award winning documentary will hit your town. If not, get the DVD when it is released.",1194739200,114,1283,5.517766497461929
3028987,1,B000YHQNCI,"I would agree with the bulk of the negative reviews on this. Christians who believe in the historical understanding of the Bible's condemnation of homosexuality are presented as ignorant, 'fundamentalists,' 'literalists', and are lumped together with radical fringe groups (e.g. the vicious Westboro Baptist Church) who picket and scream at homosexuals. There is no attempt at fairness or evenhandedness in the presentation of Biblical interpretation or the normal Christian who believes the Bible but does not hate and fear homosexuals. It seems to me that only those who are looking for the Bible to support their predetermined conclusions about sexuality would consider this an adequate treatment of the Bible's teaching on homosexuality. Not a single scholar was presented with a reply to the gay interpretations. In fact, it was not even acknowledged that such replies exist.",1473465600,,880,5.477941176470588

3029006,1,B000YHQNCI,"This movie contains outdated science and lies about the Bible. (I'm sure the producers of the film didn't know they were being lied to by the men they were interviewing. This gives them somewhat of a pass. But how can you title the movie ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" when you don't know anything about the Bible?) A man in the film claimed that the word ""abomination"" in the Bible only applies to Jewish rituals and not innate moral issues. That's of course a bold-faced lie. The Bible refers to bestiality, sacrificing children to false gods and fornication as an ""abomination."" Those are moral issues and not Jewish rituals or customs.

The movie refers to outdated science on studies involving twins. The latest studies on identical twins shows that homosexuality is not genetic. Dr. Neil Whitehead, PhD. says Because they have identical DNA, it ought to be 100%. But the studies reveal something else. If an identical twin has same-sex attraction the chances the co-twin has it are only about 11% for men and 14% for women. Because identical twins are always genetically identical, homosexuality cannot be genetically dictated. No-one is born gay, he notes. The predominant things that create homosexuality in one identical twin and not in the other have to be post-birth factors.

The fact remains that there are a lot of people who have innate desires to various sexual things. This includes pedophilia, incest, bestiality and having multiple husbands or wives. No one would argue that because these desires are innate means they were born this way or that their actions are permissable.",1432166400,9,1592,4.9588014981273405
3029007,3,B000YHQNCI,"Homosexuality is a very hot issue in our day and so I feel that it is especially beneficial for parents/family/friends to see how others have handled this issue.  This is a good video to spark discussion and promote acceptance, not necessarily for homosexual acts, but of individuals who are gay. I have bought 2 copies of this video and loaned/given them to individuals who are dealing with having gay sons/grandsons.  I write this as a father of a gay son who was loved and accepted by my entire family.  I could not and still cannot fathom how any family/parent could reject a person who is gay, not by choice but from birth.",1428451200,3,628,4.589285714285714

3029010,5,B000YHQNCI,Incredible!!,1423094400,,12,12.0
3029011,1,B000YHQNCI,"There seemed to be three major points in this film: the first is stated in my title, the second is that it is wrong to treat homosexuals violently; and it is wrong for Christians to force their beliefs on others.

I agree with points two and three. Point one, however, I will not agree with.
Consider some of the Apostle Paul's words, similar words can be found in many of his epistles:
1Co 6:9  Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
1Co 6:10  nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
1Co 6:11  And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

 I don't think that these words leave much room for redefinition of the sin of homosexuality. And it is not the only sin that believers are suppose to forsake as they grow in grace. In the beatitudes, Jesus describes what a Christian is. He is poor in spirit, mourns his sin, becomes meek because he discovers that he is spiritually bankrupt and sins incessantly, he begins to seek God's righteousness....

 So, a chief problem that the Christian believer has that shapes his entire walk, his sanctification, is his personal sinfulness.

 The Bible has a solution for sin! That solution is not to redefine it so that you can believe that you are good, or so that you can be socially acceptable--politically correct. The solution is to identify sin by viewing it in terms of God's criteria found in the 10 commandments; confess it to God; accept the forgiveness offered via God the Father's mercy via Christ's atoning work; seek the grace of God offered via his MEANS of Grace (hearing preaching; praying; reading scripture; fellowshiping with other believers around the scripture; participating in the Lord's table; and baptism). Through these means, God humbles a believer and He also REVEALS Christ to him which changes him.

 Furthermore, and most importantly, the Bible indicates that God is merciful to those who repent and seek His forgiveness and the forsaking of their sins. Psalms 51 and 32 are prime examples of this mercy, there are many others throughout the Bible. You get no mercy if you deny, or cover you sin. That judgment might be of the variety that you are given over to it to the point of being consumed by it. There are various forms of God's judgment illustrated in the pages of scripture.

 There are words in the Bible to describe exactly what is going on in this movie. Here are two examples of those words:
Isa 5:20  Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! [God has defined in the Bible just what good and evil are, those who change that definition are spoken of herein.]
Isa 9:16  for those who guide this people have been leading them astray, and those who are guided by them are swallowed up.
The books of kings in the Bible give many examples of the people being led astray by their leaders while they thought they were worshiping God.

The Christian church is filled with heresy and apostasy, that has been true since the beginning. The epistles of the Apostles deal with various kinds of heresy. The only sure way to know how to worship God is found in the scripture. There are study Bibles that have reliable interpretations of scripture, unlike those illustrated in this film.",1423008000,6,3587,4.650316455696203

If you are looking for something that questions the actual views of a Christian with an educated understanding of the Bible, then walk away. This documentary is seriously under-researched and fails to address the arguments offered by leading Christian scholars on this issue.

3029017,5,B000YHQNCI,"For The Bible Tells Me So is an uncommonly moving and powerful documentary concerning the gay offspring of Fundamentalist Christians and their family dynamics.

As the film opens, we meet several older Conservative Christians and their gay children.  The parents talk about their reaction to their childs coming out and the children talk about their experience in breaking the news.  One of the families is that of James D. Robinson, the first openly gay Bishop in the Episcopal Church.  The director, Daniel Karslake, has been careful to select families of an extremely conservative nature.  In addition to the families, several gay activists and sympathetic religious leaders are also interviewed, and clips are shown of fire-and-brimstone sermons by anti-gay preachers.

Biblical texts are examined and discussed.  Why is it, for example, that anti-gay religious people always point to the prohibition in Leviticus about men who lie with men but manage to overlook the prohibitions in the same chapter about eating shrimp and sowing two crops in the same field?  As for the New Testament, one of the women interviewed points out that the Bible says to sell all you have and give to the poor.  Yet, as she says, who says, Im going to close all my bank accounts and give all my money away?  And any person who has really studied the Bible can tell you that the true sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were that of inhospitality.  As one commentator says, The Bible has been used throughout history to discriminate  its an old trick fundamentalists have used before, and now they're doing it again.

A Gay Cartoon tackles the subject, Is it a choice and points out that research shows that, among identical twins, if one sibling is gay, there is a 70% chance that the other will be as well.  Gay children, psychologists tell us, can learn to hate themselves because of their familys or clergys reaction to their coming out.  Indeed, we see the very sad story of a mother who learned too late; her inability to accept her daughters lifestyle led to her daughters suicide.  She laments, What Ive learned is that, instead of taking the bible literally, I must consider it in the context and culture of which it was written.

What is most striking is that all of the families portrayed here have slowly come to accept their children for who they are.  Unconditional love is just that  love without conditions.  For the Bible Tells Me So is a film that all people of faith who have gay children need to see.

Highly recommended.",1417478400,2,2515,4.8023255813953485
3029018,5,B000YHQNCI,"Excellent documentary that exposes the various ways in which the church/religion is used to ""undo/retrain"" gay/lesbian youngsters.

I have watched this many times and have bought a number of copies to give away or lend out. If you have someone who is opposed to gays and lesbians on the basis of what they think is in the bible, then this is a gentle way to prod them in the direction of acceptance.

3029030,4,B000YHQNCI,"As a teenager that has grown up not only in a Catholic family but also in a society that portrays the issue of homosexuality as controversial, I found this movie extremely eye opening and interesting. Within the first few minutes of the movie, there was a quote that really stuck out to me: This country is doing everything it can to make it seem like it is okay to be gay, and its not. When I heard this I was shocked. How could someone say something so harsh and horrible? Throughout the movie, there were several families with a homosexual son or daughter. Most of the parents mentioned that when their child came out, they referred to the Bible. Leviticus 20:13 states, If a man also lie with man and a woman also lie with woman, both of them are committing an abomination. They shall be put to death, their blood is upon them. Despite the fact that I am apart of the Catholic community, I had never once before heard of this verse. I feel as though the church portrays homosexuality as a sin that should be punished with death. I find this ridiculous. Overall, I thought this movie was intriguing and gave a new perspective on homosexuality (interviews of Christian parents of homosexuals) that I had never seen before.",1401753600,,1224,4.542986425339366

The film is assembled wonderfully and is moving beyond my wildest expectations!  This is real, and this is what goes on in a family of a gay or lesbian child.  The child should watch it with their parents so that the child can understand the process that their parents and siblings go through. It's a family event and it can bring a family together or tragically divide the family.  This film shows a bit of both along with some pretty hateful rhetoric from the right wing crowd.  The misinterpretations of Bible passages have caused so much unnecessary pain.

3029037,1,B000YHQNCI,"I viewed this video as it was recommended to me as a balanced documentary dispelling the notion that the Bible was antagonistic of the gay lifestyle. The video troops out a number of pro-gay theologians that cleverly don't engage with the Bible text other than to say the clear condemnation of said lifestyle is a misunderstanding. There is no attempt to present a balanced presentation. No former homosexuals are interviewed, no commentators who would explain why the clear teaching that ""a man should not lie with a man as one would with a woman"" are interviewed.

It is a well done video with engaging personalities that serves as a propaganda piece to promote homosexuality as a genetically determined lifestyle. Just be aware that it is imbalanced in it's presentation. It's chief fundraisers are all active in the gay lifestyle.

The part where it started to confuse me was when the film started to question what the bible's passages on homosexuality actually say. Should it be read literally or is it dependent upon cultural, individual interpretation?

I think that if a person wants to believe in the bible, they should believe in what the bible has written down. There might be room and leeway for some interpretation (as with all books), but to try and make the jump from the bible condemning homosexuality to accepting/or not mentioning it...that seems like a far stretch to me. It seems as if some of the people in the film are choosing what they want to believe and then trying to find a way to fit the bible around it...shouldn't it be the other way around? If you are going to be Christian, shouldn't you look at what the bible says, and then live life in accordance with what it proclaims?

Either way...there is some cognitive dissonance going on. I would have preferred more balance and objectivity to the film. The film has a tremendous pro-gay bias and it's main purpose is to remove homophobia.",1349049600,17,1228,4.706976744186046

3029069,5,B000YHQNCI,"Clearly the main point is to break down the interpretation walls that lead conservatives to hate without really knowing anything more than what they have been taught through generations, but as a liberal agnostic (raised in a strictly Catholic family) I ended up with an enlightened view myself. Before this documentary I felt the Bible was just a book that caused issues through out society excusing all kinds of wrong doing in the name of God. I now see I a was just as lost as my conservative extremist counterparts.

This documentary helped me realize the Bible is much like everything we read or watch, the message is in the eye of the beholder. The black lesbian woman helped me realize this when she mentioned the messages she gets when she reads the Bible in contrast to a white straight man. I realized that this happens all the time, I watched Drive and I ended up loving the message it carried, when at the beginning of the film he asks the kid (while watching cartoons) ""how do you know he's the bad guy?"" and the kind answers ""he's a shark"" and then he asks back ""so all sharks are bad?"". It was so deep in my eyes the way we put characters (and people)in boxes, as if everything is black and white when in fact there is a lot of grey. Anyway, my friend hated the movie, said that it was way too much gore and killing, which reminds me of this topic. We both watched the movie but got completely different messages from it, just like when each of us read the Bible (or any religious book for that matter).

Also, it's so important to take context into the interpretation, I mean, let's say the Bible said it is an abomination for anyone to have a booty, in our time a booty is a rear-end, when the original word refers to a stolen treasure. So as much as a stubborn mind wants to deny it, figures of speech were different then than now what is important is to try to get the inspiring message from what we watch and read instead of taking it for face value, which at it's very core about loving and respecting each other even when other's views aren't our own.",1339459200,,2073,4.367875647668394
3029070,5,B000YHQNCI,"Believe it or not, this is a very inspiring movie. It doesn't start out that way, with all this anti-homosexual rhetoric, especially by fundamentalist preachers. But we meet the families of gay men and women, the gay and lesbians they have come to understand and accept, and the ways in which they have helped bring LGBT rights to the forefront of public awareness.

Take Gene Robinson, for example, the first openly gay Episcopalian bishop (New Hampshire), and indeed the first in the entire Anglican communion. His parents and his ex-wife are included in the movie, talking at length about how they came to accept that he was gay. And ultimately, how they were supportive of his election to Bishop even in the face of death threats (he wore a bullet-proof vest under his cassock at the ritual) and an army of reporters and cameras.

Chrissy Gephardt, lesbian daughter of Dick Gephardt, talking about her life and how it impacted and was impacted by her father's run for the presidential nomination.

Rondi and Phil Reitan had a charming young son. They were plenty shook up when he told them he was gay, and decided they had to become informed about the facts of homosexuality. What they learned was so very different from what James Dobson had told them on ""Focus on the Family"" that they decided to take the fight for gay rights to him. They wrote a letter which they read to the crowd, and the police told them that if they crossed onto Dobson's property, they would be arrested. Mrs. Reitan decided she had to deliver the letter, and she and her husband and her son were indeed arrested. Do you think Dobson got the message?

Brenda and David Poteet, very conservative black Christians, also appear in the film and talk frankly about their lesbian daughter. They will go only so far and no further in accepting her ""lifestyle,"" as David puts it, but they love their daughter and they accept her for who she is.

There is a good bit of discussion about the people who claim homosexuality is a choice, that they can be ""cured,"" and that parents should take that approach. This viewpoint is quite thoroughly discredited, including some interesting current scientific evidence that birth order is one of the important causes for gay males especially. It seems a mother's body treats the maleness of a fetus as an alien invasion. The more often she has boys, the more her body adapts by feminizing the fetus. Statistically, gay men are more likely to have several older brothers.

The saddest story is a woman whose Lesbian daughter had a hard time with her mother, and eventually committed suicide. After her daughter died, the mother studied the truth about lesbianism and finally became an outspoken advocate for gay rights. She felt her daughter had not died in vain, because she learned to love her and effectively ""make restitution"" for her coldness to her daughter.

This is a very intense movie, and includes quite a few religious leaders, both for and against, who speak their minds about the passages in the Bible that are used to condemn gays. Some important points are made, most poetically by Bishop Desmond Tutu.",1336953600,6,3127,4.779629629629629
3029071,4,B000YHQNCI,"As a young man who regularly attended church and took an active part in the youth ministry, I was really disturbed when I began to suspect I might be gay. Everyone told us that homosexuality was never God's plan, and I had to silently deal with these strange feelings that I felt must be sinful.

Finally, early this month, I came to terms with it: I'm gay and I didn't know what that meant about my faith. My family was fortunately very understanding, and my sister's husband suggested I check out this documentary, especially after a respected church member sent me some rather disturbing and condemning messages.

I watched it alone, and it was really difficult to sit through in many places. I feel the producers were quite varied in their responses and selection of footage: we had the radical Bible-thumping Christians, while also looking at five Christian families who had gay children.

In the stories, I felt I met kindred spirits in them. A lot of their thoughts and fears mirrored my own, so it was wonderful to know that I was not alone in these feelings and wondering if being a gay Christian was even possible.

However, a downside to the even-handedness is that I didn't feel the question was answered clearly. Many interpretations of the Bible's few references to homosexuality are presented, no one interpretation being favored. Overall, I got the message that a passionate love for someone of your own gender is not evil, but the question of intimacy was certainly left ambiguous.

So, while it did help answer some of my questions and let me know I am not alone, I think I'll have to look elsewhere for more answers. A great starting point, I suppose.",1335571200,12,1670,4.725085910652921
3029072,5,B000YHQNCI,"A good friend shared this documentary with me and it blew me away!  The issues of homosexuality, religion and spirituality are approached with such dignity, respect and love, I knew I had to share it with my parents.  I bought it for them and we watched it together over the Christmas holidays.  They already knew about my sexuality, but this allowed us to talk more deeply and we are beginning to recapture some of the closeness we shared before I came out.

I love seeing the 5 different families and hearing their stories - personally it's inspiring to see families growing stronger who (sooner or later) embrace their children's sexuality.  I would recommend this to anyone whose parents or family members are Christian and is dealing with issues of homosexuality.  It is an honest and touching portrayal of families working through their differences in love.

3029073,4,B000YHQNCI,"I agree with the person who said that this doc, though an awesome window into how people have misinterpreted the Bible and have taken things quite literal to tell people what they should think, is somewhat outdated. I'd love a rerelease of this with an update on the families that they focused on.

They mentioned Don't Ask Don't Tell, which since this was release has been repelled (which was a major goal of the Obama Administration). And let's not forget that there have also been several states now that have allowed homosexual marriages. It's funny how 4 or so years can change so much about this culture. Not to mention that Bush was beginning to get vastly unpopular during that time, and liberal voices that championed the idea of religion being misused became mainstream, and that the conservative voices that condemned homosexuality have been on the decline (you hardly hear about James Dobsion anymore unless he's Tebowing).

But all in all, a heart wrenching testament into how many church goers had to think about their beliefs, and what it sometimes takes for someone to really have it sink in that what they believe might not be the right path. I'd advise everyone to watch this, but keep in mind how things have changed since then for homosexuals.

A final word: though clips OF them picketing are seen in this doc, there is no verbal mention of a certain family that lives in Topeka, Kansas that is responsible for said pickets (you'll recognize them right away). Not sure what to say about that omission, because on one hand, that family IS important to such dialogue because of what they've done to get into the spotlight, hut on the other hand, name recognition is all the head of that family needs to continue to do what he does.",1328140800,,1750,4.712418300653595

3029075,4,B000YHQNCI,"While a bit dated, this would be an excellent film for a parent or parents struggling with the sexual orientation of a child or other family member.  Many parents and their children may be devout members of an organized religion that ""condemms the sin, but loves the sinner.""  The knowledge that one of their children may be gay or lesbian is certainly hard to take, but here is help that may put the pain in better perspective.  The ""pick and choose"" use of Liviticus is made quite clear, and how gays have become scapegoats for the sins of others.  There is one strong example of how a parent could not understand or accept her child's orientation until after that child's suicide. She then became an advocate for love and acceptance. This is not a unique situation, and the film just might prevent such a terrible outcome if seen by parents who cannot accept their child or relative's orientation. The film also makes clear that parents should not feel any shame or guilt, but should do all they can to understand and support their loved one - and also will need to accept with love whomever that person chooses as a life partner.  The possibility of love from families and even entire congregations is well documented in the film.  So many suicides by young people might be prevented if only love and acceptance were offered, instead of rigid denial and outright condemnation because of ""the bible tells me so"" rational.

3029080,5,B000YHQNCI,"I was recently looking for a good documentary about religion and social issues to watch and kind of just stumbled upon this one.  I did not realize until 20 minutes into it (lol) that the film deals only with the LGBT community and their parents as it relates to Christianity .  I was very moved and would highly recommend For The Bible Tells Me So to anyone who believes religious text justifies non acceptance and/or discrimination towards the LGBT community.

For The Bible Tells Me So is a documentary which chronicles the plight (and ultimate acceptance) of a handful of baby boomer parents and older of gay and/or lesbian children who initially had negative feelings about their children's sexual orientation due to biblical scripture.  The documentary also references religious scholars who interpret the Bible from both a historically academic point of view (the whole ""time and place"" theory of words and their context during biblical times) as well as a personal religious one often stating that the Bible is a nuanced text that holds different meanings for different readers.  The format of For The Bible Tells Me So shows parents of gay and/or lesbian adult children discussing how deeply steeped in their church communities they are and how sad, angry and confused they were over what they believed the Bible and their church community taught about homosexuality.  Most of the families chronicled seemed more sad and confused but at least tried to understand their children, however one mother was so unaccepting that her daughter wound up committing suicide (it may have not been the only reason, but it probably was part of it).  Ultimately, all of the parents in the film wound up becoming social activists on behalf of the LGBT community even going so far as to march in unity to the headquarters of Focus On The Family to deliver a letter to its founder who literally instructs parents of gay/lesbian children not to accept them so they will ""turn away"" from their ""choice.""

During a time when gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered youth suicide is becoming alarmingly common, it would be helpful for parents of these children (especially the more religious and conservative ones) to take a deep breath, do some reading outside of the church and watch this documentary (I'm sure there are also many others that discuss the same topic that are well rounded) before they make an often stressful and confusing time more stressful and confusing.  :-(

Their willingness--and unwillingness--to look beyond the literal interpretation of the Bible to the importance of the people they love and the message of God's love was challenging and inspirational. I cried several times as I watched and rewatched it.
The calm presentation by open-hearted theologians and church leaders (including Desmond Tutu who drew the parallel of church-condoned discrimination against gays with past discrimination against blacks) was in stark contrast to the often strident tone of those who condemn gays.
If I could have made one change, it would have been to the beginning. The strong presentation of anti-gay evangelicals belies the heartwarming and uplifting nature of the rest of the film. In sharing it with friends who are conservatively religious--and I believe it needs to be shared--I felt I needed to ask them to ignore the first five minutes.",1313798400,2,983,5.348387096774194
3029082,5,B000YHQNCI,"My review on the movie ""The Matthew Shepard Story, Now I have ordered the movie, but I have watched it several times on Lifetime and I used to watch it on YouTube but they removed it for some reason. I really like the movie myself, I am not a homosexual but I believe that everyone should be treated the same with the exact same respect that others demand to get.

This movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry and most of all it tells you how some people can be as far as treating people just because they happen to be different or gay. What they did to poor Matthew is so unbearable and I don't care what he did, he did not deserve what they did to him, no one deserves that. It's a good thing that Matthews Parents thought with their heart and thought of Matthew when they asked for life in imprisonment not the death penalty.

I have one more thing to say on this subject and that is Matthew Shepard story is about a boy who was different and he had so much love to give someone but did not get the chance, and it is sad that some people are so cruel because they don't understand how someone can be like that, well Matthew did not do anything to anyone except try to fit in somewhere and wanted to make friends and live his life, but that was interrupted because 2 boys decided they was going to play God all because they say that Matthew hit on them, but testimony says different.

What makes anyone else any better than you? They are not. I myself am a homosexual supporter and I do not care if you know my name, and you can call me names I do not care, But I do believe in God and since God does not make mistakes therefore he made everyone in his imaiage and even though some would disagree I believe that God made homosexuals too!

Being born homosexual is not a choice its how it is, and those of you that do not like it..well tough get over it because I am 100% sure there are just as many homosexuals these days as there are homophobic people. You need to take the good with the bad and just hope you fit in somewhere.

Answer this question would you let someone tell you who you can be with? even if you are of age? I doubt anyone of you would. I think that ANYONE should be able to marry anyone as long as they are of age, it should not matter if its 2 men or 2 women or man and woman. It should be up to the person and that is it.

I am sorry for those of you think because the bible says one thing, considering that book was wrote how long ago and its the old testament anyways, and this is 2011 not the beginning of time.

I hope I did not offend anyone that was not why I said what I did.

The passages in the Bible that supposedly condemn homosexuality are re-examined, closely scrutinized and re-read  with some very surprising results for each of the families  that tell their stories in this documentary.  I came to the conclusion after viewing this film that the answer to all of ""gay questions"" is very simple, love.  That's really the answer all of the 5 families found to be true that it all comes down to loving NOT hating.  All of the families stories (especially the Richard Gephardt and Episcopal Archbishop, Gene Richardson ) were very touching proving through their stories that love in a family is so necessary and is really beautiful  and can counteract all of the negativity and nastiness that can manifest itself especially on the subject of ""being Gay""

This hour and a half 2007 documentary on one disc with post film extras is very well directed and moves along at a good pace.  This film really gives us the viewing audience an idea of what some families ""go through"" when it's found out that their daughter or son is Gay.

3029091,5,B000YHQNCI,"I truly believe that ""God"" is a creation of man, for no other purpose than to strike fear into humanity. By the same token, organized religion is born of this fear and assures that people stay in line, do what they are told, and are charged sums of money for the purpose of lining the pockets of the clergy. Organized religion, by its nature, hates dissent, and will do anything to destroy it. This movie confirms that organized religion, and whatever holy books they use to promote their evil, are the most destructive forces on Earth. So what happens when people question what their religion has taught them about homosexuality? Other organized religions attack them, just as they have for centuries; they seek to demonize them, legislate against them, and even kill them. Yes, folks, this is the true face of religion. It is given credence by the simple-minded notion that there is someone who lives in the sky and watches everything we do. That not only appeals to humanity's bizarre fascination with super heros with magical powers, but it always plays to humanity's fear of death. One can live forever in paradise if they follow the right religion. Well, isn't that the greatest con job of all time! While this important movie makes a profound case for a new way of looking at homosexuality through the lens of religion, all it proves to me is that organized religion will drive humanity to the breaking point and destruction. I guess it will take an apocalypse of Biblical proportions before humanity grows up and chooses Reason as the guide in life, rather be preyed upon by superstition.",1294012800,5,1596,4.786231884057971

3029093,5,B000YHQNCI,"OK, maybe a little one-sided, but there's certainly a lot to be said about the brain-washing of the church-going society at large. Religion (or a form of it) has been responsible for most of the wars of the world, as well as some of the more abhorrant incidents in history (Inquisition, Holocaust, etc.) The Christian Right is hateful and mean-spirited; kids spew venom against gays that could've only been learned in the church or at home. I applaud this film for making an attempt to explain that the Bible has always been misinterpreted, and our church-going populace has been taught to hate. To hear young people spew hatred is especially unsettling. A subject this huge cannot be sufficiently argued in a 2 hour film, so it's a little one-sided, pro-gay. What bothers me the most is how wrong those fundamentalists can be about Jesus' initial message: Love one another and try to get along. The Bible was written by men who thought the earth was flat. We've come a long way, baby, and it's time to realize that God gave every individual a brain, capable of thinking, to reach out and discover mysteries that we may not have pondered. Life goes on. Dick Gephardt and his daughter were a fine example of what this film tried to get across. Also, the inclusion of people of color. The suicide of the daughter whose parents simply refused to understand. (No mention of Dick Cheney and his gay daughter). Fact is, all people are different, and in so VERY many different ways. Accepting these differences is what makes life exciting; to be stuck in a rut of thought, like that Christian Right, denies one the ability to live life at its fullest. This is a worthy film endeavor. Some insightful DVD extras.'Nuff said...",1289520000,5,1717,4.726666666666667
3029094,5,B000YHQNCI,"I had the opportunity to see this film at my church as part of a new companion study that's just been released, and I want to say how much both have helped me in my understanding of this issue. The class was at my Methodist church here in Nashville, and I joined it because I confess that, despite all the controversies surrounding this issue -- gay marriage, gays in the military, etc. -- I really hadn't gone beyond a surface understanding of the scripture. Mostly, I have been upset by how much this issue has divided our church, and I haven't been sure how to feel about it.

We watched the film the first week of the class. More than anything, I think it took me beyond the word ""issue"" and really opened my eyes to the human suffering that has been caused by our Christian tradition. I have no doubt that certain Christian practices are in place with the intent of upholding the Word of God. But how can God not be compassionate amid the pain endured by the families in this film?

God calls each of us to undertake a faith journey with an openness to the Holy Spirit, and the film definitely showed me the Holy Spirit was at work, particularly in the stories of Gene Robinson, the woman who lost her daughter to suicide, and the Minnesota couple with the gay son. Watching this film, I saw how these people changed their hearts not necessarily because they wanted to (after all, it's a lot easier to stick with the status quo), but because they were compelled to only after great thought and prayer and study. Literally, soul-searching.

After watching the film, I yearned for a similar experience, and I must say, in the next six weeks I found it through the study. It's called ""This I Know,"" and each of the six lessons is written by a different author. The two that really caught my attention are Brian McLaren and Marcus Borg. McLaren is big in evangelical circles and he's written several influential books. (My church did a Sunday school class series on his ""Everything Must Change."") Borg has certainly made a national name as an authority of Christ's teachings.

Each lesson is a step in a journey of both your mind and your heart. For me, the study was able to fill in some of the gaps the film left, particularly in the depth of scriptural understanding. Not to knock the film, but there's only so much you can cover in that time frame. There was a lesson by a national expert on the Apostle Paul, who did a great job of introducing me to the context of his writings. I also came to understand why the beliefs about sin and homosexuality have been kept going through the centuries. The lesson that most blew me away was written by a devout Mennonite who made a complete turn-around in her beliefs. The last chapter, which is Borg's, is all about putting Christ at the center of our understanding. Our class did include a couple members who are gay, and being face to face with their pain and faith struggle also really made an impact on me.

You can find the study at its own website (search for ""This I Know study""). I highly recommend both together, especially if your church is looking for a ""safe"" way to get into the topic. While the film and the study both have a certain perspective, they present it with the authority to back it up. In other words, I never felt belittled or beaten over the head -- as I would by the ""death to fags"" protesters in the film! I came away from the whole experience feeling like I truly took my own journey and came to my own conclusions, and I'm now trying to get more Sunday school classes at my church to offer it. This is what we need to make our peace with this issue once and for all.",1285372800,6,3644,4.400593471810089
3029095,5,B000YHQNCI,"This DVD succinctly points out that those who take the Bible as the absolute word of God are largely responsible for the fear and hatred of homosexuals. They interpret the Bible literally, refusing to understand or even acknowledge that it was written by man, for man, and that if they take the passages regarding homosexuality literally they are being hypocritical -- would they stone their daughter to death if she was not a virgin before marriage or would they sell her into slavery, for instance? -- two things that the Bible instructs them to do. In other words, these literalists pick out what they agree with and ignore that which they do not agree with. If they love God so much that they want to follow what they interpret as His absolute word then whatever happened to love thy neighbor as thyself? Don't they understand that God made man and that God would never have made an entire group of people and put them on this earth for the sole purpose of being targets for discrimination and hatred?

3029098,1,B000YHQNCI,"I was disappointed with this documentary.

I was expecting actual facts from the Bible regarding homosexuality, but there were few and none that concretely proved a point.  It was a movie that was moving, but only on an emotional level, hardly on a Biblical one.

After watching this I was encouraged to go directly to Leviticus and read about homosexuality in concert with eating shell-fish and selling daughters into slavery, etc...but found that Lev. 18 deals specifically with all types of SEXUAL sins.  It said nothing about cultural traditions, well, unless you consider sex with siblings, in-laws, or animals cultural traditions.  As a matter of fact Lev. 18:22 is just one verse in the middle of Several verses providing instruction for who NOT to do in bed.

The movie seemed to cloud the actual context of the Bible verses it referred to and I can understand why those who don't refer DIRECTLY to the source (the Bible) would be led to believe that God would accept those actions because of His unconditional love.

When I read about Jesus it seems to me that He was always telling people to CHANGE their behaviors after His grace was extended to them.  Go and sin no more. That's the wonder of Jesus' love and salvation.  It fills us with the power and ability to leave our sinful nature and habits to follow Him.

I appreciated the personal stories in this movie and am encouraged to show homosexuals the true love of Christ.

As I read the Bible for myself and see how Jesus came to save us from our sins, I am still not convinced that God accepts homosexuals as they are no more than He can accept a liar or thief the way they are.

Overall I was disappointed that this movie showed a bias towards acceptance of a behavior rather than a truthful and accurate accounting of Biblical instruction.",1277596800,48,1808,4.650943396226415

3029105,5,B000YHQNCI,"Who would have thought that the consecration of a bishop in New Hampshire of all places would send a fissure though the global church - not just the Anglican Church, but the church as a whole. But the consecration of an openly gay man has done just that, laying bare the divisions over sexuality that permeates the Christian Community. The Rt. Rev. Gene Robinson, Bishop of New Hampshire has become the symbol of our unease with our sexuality and its place in the church.

The film begins with Anita Bryant, back in the 1970s denouncing the ""gay agenda."" Interspersed through the film are angry denouncements of homosexuality on the part of Christians, like Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Dobson, and the ubiquitous folk from Topeka's Westborough Baptist Church.

But that is not the essence of the film. Instead it is the stories of real families who struggle with their children's sexual identity and their own religious formation. Five families are interviewed - including the family of Bishop Robinson, whose own spiritual foundations are not Episcopal, but Disciples of Christ. His parents still members of the same Kentucky Disciple church that he grew up in share their pride in their son and the journey they took to embrace him as he is, despite their earlier formation. Another famous family is that of former Congressman Richard Gephardt, whose daughter Chrissie is a lesbian. Some of the stories, like those of the Gephardts and the Robinsons are happy, but not all are. Mary Lou Wallner tells the story of her estrangement from her lesbian daughter Anna, largely on the basis of her faith formation and understanding of the Bible - an understanding she got largely from Focus on the Family. That story ends tragically in the suicide death of her daughter. But out of that tragedy came hope, for Mary Lou began to study and found that her previous understandings had been wrong. Now she speaks out on behalf of the gay and lesbian community. There is another family that is conflicted - they love their daughter and welcome her, but they can't accept who she is. That's a work in progress. Finally there's the story of Jake Reitan, a young gay man who grew up in a solid - Lutheran - Christian family. It took time for his family to embrace him as he is, but in the long run they became advocates, standing with him as Soul Force demonstrated at the Focus on the Family headquarters.

The powerful statement these stories make is that this is a personal issue. Whatever your views of homosexuality or of the Bible, things change when it affects your family. How you read the Bible is influenced by your own experiences. That is true of me - I'm a graduate of a leading evangelical seminary, whose president is featured in the film (unfortunately affirming traditional interpretations of these texts that excluded), but when my brother came out, things changed. Our hang up is with sex, but when we realize that this is my brother, or my sister, or my son or my daughter, what do we do? Dick Gephardt says it well - when Chrissie came out, fearing that she might be disowned, he declared a parent's unconditional love. Love won out. As Mel White put it: ""Once they realize who we are up close and personal that fear goes away.""

The film deals with the families, but it also deals with the texts. A series of speakers, ranging from Mel White, Peter Gomes, Desmond Tutu to Rabbi Stephen Greenberg, Disciples pastors Larry Keene and Steve Kindle, and an American Baptist woman pastor Sandra Sparks. Each of these speakers takes on our cultural presuppositions, formed by our faith traditions, and the Biblical texts - of which there are only about six, few of which even apply today in any real way. We hear that Leviticus declares a man lying with a man to be an abomination, but then it also says the same about eating shrimp. As Larry Keene, a Disciple pastor and former Pepperdine professor points out, the question isn't so much what the Bible seems to say, but how we read it and use it today.

At the heart of the debate is the question of choice - is it a choice or not? The film takes on this question creatively, through the use of a brief, at times humorous, but pointed cartoon. This piece sits in the middle of the film, providing both comic relief and movement forward on the discussion. And as most reputable science states, this isn't a choice, it is one's identity. If so, then we must ask: what next for our society?

We live at a time when the vast numbers of people are biblically illiterate and read the Bible in bits and pieces, influenced largely by their own upbringing. This reading is combined with great amounts of fear. It is true that our society's greatest fear is of male homosexuals - a fear of a feminization of a man. To be gay is to be - in the eyes of many - feminine. Gay men, such as White and Robinson, make it clear that this isn't true. But the fear is still there, and it's a fear we must address. Our fear leads us to plead with gays and lesbians to stay in the closet, but as Mel White points out, the ""closet is a place of death."" Young gays, feeling suppressed and forced into a closet, with no one to talk with, too often and very tragically, take their own lives. And why? Because our society is permeated by fear of the other and formed by outmoded interpretations of the Bible.

Is this film biased? Of course it is. It is a strongly stated, but not in your face, statement of the dignity and equality and the humanity of our gay and lesbian friends, neighbors, and family members. It is a film that must be seen. At this point it is in fairly restricted distribution, but hopefully this will change - for the church must change so that the world might change.

If the film begins (with the exception of the Anita Bryant outburst) with an introduction of the Robinson family, it appropriately ends with his joyous and yes controversial consecration as Bishop of New Hampshire. The world will never be the same - and that's a good thing.",1258329600,7,5984,4.585981308411215
3029106,3,B000YHQNCI,"I viewed this film recently to see what, if anything, it could contribute to an understanding the classical Jewish and Christian understandings about homosexuality. Its Biblical hermeneutics were no more than retreads of the hackneyed ""higher criticism"" school along with very weak and tenuous suppositions about what St. Paul ""really meant"" in Romans etc.

But messy and ultimately ""irrelevant"" details of Biblical scholarship and Christian teaching aside (for ultimately these are not the core issues for the film-makers) I have given this film a THREE-STAR rating for being very well-made propaganda meant to give emotional satisfaction and affirmation for those already opposing the traditional western religious perspectives on homosexuality. In this respect the film is similar to Bill Maher's ""Religulous"" or Ben Stein's ""Expelled"" - if you are already one of Maher's fellow atheists or Stein's fellow ""intelligent design"" advocates you will find the respective films reaffirming, entertaining, and full of ridicule of the opposing positions. Perhaps all three films belong to some special genre of ""Preaching to the Choir"" films which need some special designation or category to distinguish them from more serious documentaries. However for those who are already sympathetic to the film's thesis this will be a very enjoyable, self-affirming way to pass 96 minutes of your time.

If you are one of those, like the several families shown in this film, who really do find the current teachings of your home denomination regarding homosexuality to be ""hateful"" or ""harmful"" there is a simple solution:  Quit your current denomination and join one of the several denominations, such as the Episcopal Church of the United States, or the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, whose teaching on faith and morals are more to your liking.

3029112,1,B000YHQNCI,"'For The Bible Tells Me So' is seriously biased and intellectually deceiving when it comes to examining what the whole Bible actually says about homosexuality. Instead of presenting a serious argument for homosexuality from within the text, the documentary plays on emotions and commits several logical fallacies of relevance (personal attacks, appeals to consequences, etc.).

First of all, the story of the couple whose daughter committed suicide rightly deserves compassion. However, suicide does not make homosexuality right or wrong. Many people and teenagers in particular commit suicide, unfortunately. And the reasons for suicide are numerous: bankruptcy, emotional pain, loneliness, murder, etc. While we have compassion for the persons, their suicide neither validates nor invalidates their actions; it is irrelevant in that regard. This is only one example of the many instances of the documentary playing on emotion rather than presenting a rigorous argument to win the audience's opinion.

Second, while the Scriptures deal with homosexuality in several texts, the focus of what ""the Bible so tells me"" seems to be on Leviticus 18. Leviticus 18 deals first with incest of any kind, then adultery, then human (children) sacrifice to idols, then homosexuality, then bestiality. Oddly enough, this documentary does not say anything about any of that, except homosexuality. What about incest, adultery, and sacrificing children on altars to idols, for instance?  Any biblically literate person knows that the chapter subdivisions were later added to the text. So a look at Leviticus 19 in the same context shows: prohibition of idolatry, stealing, fraud, lying, robbery, injustice in judgment, hatred, vengeance, occultism, and prostitution; commandment of administering justice, loving the neighbor, welcoming the stranger, honoring the elderly, etc. The documentary mentions none of those things but does point at Leviticus 19:27 where neither the sides of the head nor the edges of one's beard were to be shaved, and hastily concludes the whole text is irrelevant to contemporary reality.
Here is the evidence of intellectual dishonesty and grossly misleading hermeneutics: while the producers took the time to show the ""context"" of Sodom & Gomorrah and of Romans 1, as they claimed, to discredit any claim opposing their view, they did none of this for the Leviticus passage. For example, a look at history shows the shaving and trimming of hair and beard in particular ways as ritual practices in honor of particular pagan deities (Orotal for example). The prohibition of that practice was thus congruent with that of other idolatrous practices, such as the sacrifice of children or body cuts.

Third, the treatment of Romans 1 is astoundingly dishonest. The claim that ""unnatural"" does not mean ""immoral"" and is only culturally-conditioned (Jews vs. Romans) does not stand a close-reading of the passage, which shows the use in the same context as ""unnatural"" of the following terms: ""lust, dishonor their bodies, vile passions, shameful, penalty, error, debased mind, things not fitting, unrighteousness.""  Moreover, homosexuality is not singled out, but mentioned alongside ""wickedness, greed, malice, envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness, backbiting, hatred of God, violence, pride, boasting, invention of evil things, disobedience to parents, undiscernment, untrustworthiness, lack of love, unforgiveness, lack of mercy"", in a way similar to 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. The attempts to dispute the meaning of the greek text or to restrict the prohibition to a strictly Jewish audience or to justify ""monogamous long-term homosexual relationships"" seriously disregards both the literal and cultural context of both texts, which were written to two different cultural audiences, Romans and Corinthians.

Fourth, the claim that the problem of Sodom & Gomorrah in Genesis 19 was inhospitality rather than sexual immorality and homosexuality does not stand 2 Peter 2:6-8 and Jude 7 and seems a too hasty attempt to evade the all-too clear reality exposed in those passages.

Fifth, the claim that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality is akin to saying he never said anything about incest or bestiality or the sacrificing of children to idols and thus approves of them. That is a fallacy of relevance. More to the point, however, Jesus does speak about relationship and marriage: ""Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. (Matthew 19:4-6)"". So, Jesus did say the Creator made humans male and female. And Jesus did not even envision the possibility of a marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman to address it, but a MAN leaving his FATHER AND MOTHER, and clinging unto his WIFE. And when confronting adultery, he says the one who ""looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with HER in HIS heart (Matthew 5:27-28)."" It couldn't be clearer. You can't miss that. In this sense, Jesus did say everything about homosexuality.

Sixth, putting food regulations in the Bible on par with what the Bible says about sexuality disregards what Jesus said about food in Matthew 15 and Mark 7, namely: ""There is nothing that enters a man from outside which can defile him. It is what comes out of a man that defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within and defile a man."" Moreover, the early church dealt with this problem and resolved it at the Jerusalem Council as described in Acts 15, concluding that there was to be ""no greater burden than these necessary things: abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality."" In other words, food regulations do not hold for Jesus and the Church. They were ""a shadow of the things to come"" (Colossians 2:16-17).

Lastly, one often-heard claim that was implied in this documentary is that Paul was not inspired to write those words, that they cannot be considered scripture and therefore do not stand. Along that line of thought (which is an appeal to authority to discredit a statement), it is interesting to read Peter, arguably the most authoritative apostle after Jesus, commending Paul and his writings in 2 Peter 3: ""our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, as also in all his epistles, speaking in them these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do the rest of the Scriptures."" So Peter respected Paul and had the humility to admit learning from him. Moreover, Paul gave up his life for the sake of preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles without the requirements of the law regarding washings, food regulations, circumcision, etc., against the Judaizers who sought to kill him for exactly that. Paul was the first to defend the freedom of the Spirit in Christ, and the other apostles agreed with him as narrated in Acts 15.

In conclusion, ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" fails to present an argument for homosexuality from the Bible and rather revels in misinformation, twisting of the truth, arguments ad hominem, irrelevant appeals, and psychological devices to win the naive watcher. It would have been better to make an argument from outside the Bible. The bits of pseudo-science such as animals being homosexual were very disturbing and, at best, sarcastically laughable. It is true that the Christian response to homosexuality should be one of love and respectful engagement. However, presenting Gene Robinson as a ""holy man"" after he divorced his wife -- who did not commit adultery -- to live with a male lover is really a joke, in regard of all Christian teaching. He is unrepentant and disqualified for leadership in the Church (1 Timothy 3, Titus 1). He was also admitted in rehab in 2006 for alcoholism. There is still hope for him, if he repents. Jesus died on the Cross so that no one else has to die. He rose so that everyone can live. He offers abundant life and freedom from sin. God loves everyone, and He loves us too much to leave us broken: He restores, if we would let Him. The choice is ours.  Sin deceives us, tortures us, and kills us. It is not homophobic to say that homosexuality is sinful, just as it is not ""adulterophobic"" to say that adultery is sinful, or ""liarphobic"" to say that lying is sinful. Exert some more critical thinking. Love and peace.",1249689600,88,8844,5.113494809688581
3029113,3,B000YHQNCI,"I gave this ""propagandamentary"" three stars because it was competantly edited and at least had a soundtrack, and did not go out of it's way using obvious propaganda techniques, like weird music or grainy video, to make the ""wrong"" people (in this case those fundamentalist Christians) look bad.

But beyond that it was just as I predicted.  I got to see...

The completely predictable Christians arguing out of the book of Leviticus against homosexuality, seeming oblivious to the fact that neither Christians nor the secular world are bound by the Law of Moses.

The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones pointing out that since Leviticus contains laws against eating foods that we know we can eat, and about mixing different kinds of cloth, that therefore the Levitical laws against homosexuality are invalid for us too.

The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones invalidating Paul's obvious prohibition against homosexuality in Romans 1 (but I didn't predict that the reason given was that Paul simply could not envision long term monogamous homosexual relationships).  But Paul is rather obvious in his meaning in 1 cor 6:9 too.

The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones making it seem as though Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for their ""inhospitality"" rather than their sexual issues.  The ""enlightened"" ones missed, however, that Sodom and Gomorrah are mentioned many times later in scripture, not the least by Jude 1:7 in the New Testament as examples of those who give themselves up to sexual immorality.  So apparently Jude was unaware that the problem was really ""inhospitality"".

Then there's the predictable Christian parents who have children who turn out to be homosexual; the discrediting of the Christain programs that claim to convert homosexuals back to heterosexuals; and of course, the footage of the young redneckish teen male who loves to beat up homosexuals, as though this represents Christianity of any flavor.  I'll stop there; wouldn't want to give away the ending.

So what is worse, the Christians who waste their time trying to contain or control homosexuality through political means, or the ""enlightened"" ones who convince the biblically illiterate that there's nothing in the bible that condemns homosexuality?  Beats me.

3029119,5,B000YHQNCI,"This DVD of ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" was recommended to me by one of my online friends with whom I'd discussed my Christian faith after being raised in a Jewish household.  The irony is, the recommender is a Jew, himself.  He said this documentary placed great emphasis on the church's negative stance on homosexuality.  I discovered quickly that the DVD was available in the library system of Indianapolis and reserved it immediately.  It took a couple of months to get here, but it was worth the wait.

The interviews with figures such as Dr. Mel White, Bishop V. Gene Robinson, Jacob Reitan, his parents, Peter J. Gomes and all the others were enlightening and touching.  And, the archive footage of the opposition was properly childish and angering.  In college, I ran with the sort of people that openly judged gays and lesbians unfairly.  After graduation, I came to realize how mistaken they were.  After watching this disc, I immediately decided to someday purchase a copy of it.  In time, I bought it for both me and one of my dear friends.

The most climactic part of the film for me was a segment near the end.  The Reitan family had ventured to the Focus on the Family headquarters in Colorado Springs to present Dr. Jim Dobson with love propaganda. They were turned away without a word, the property was carted off, the shades pulled down and the authorities called in to prevent entrance.  It was pathetic the way the Reitans were arrested, because Dr. Dobson had put his fingers in his ears to block out what turned out just to be love propaganda.

When I watched that segment for the first time, I was so enraged I nearly broke up one of my guitars.  But, what would that have achieved?  The anger would still be there, I'd have one less instrument to use for positive purposes, and Dr. Dobson would still be what I call ""a pseudo-theologian with a pseudo-reputation, spouting pseudo-spiritual lessons about a whole lot of nothing.  And, the only genuine article he's got is his silver hair.""  (Sorry, that's paraphrasing a line from an episode of the sitcom, A Different World.)  The man evidently suffers from a blind, ignorant stubbornness I call ""Brick Wall Syndrome.""  And, the arrest of the Reitans is a clear re-creation of the incident of Sodom when the angels were assaulted by the residents.  But, he is a human being, and there's always divine hope for any human.

The Lord doesn't hate gays or lesbians anymore than he hates blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, believers in Shinto, Universalist Unitarians, non-believers - or anybody.  He doesn't hate the United States of America.  And, He doesn't hate the Episcopal Church.  He couldn't possibly see the use of apartheid, the degradation of women, revoking their right to choose or insulting other peoples' creeds, either.  If He hated, He wouldn't be the Lord.",1242086400,3,2861,4.7995910020449895
3029120,2,B000YHQNCI,"The problem with this film is that it doesn't provide a balanced view of the issue and portrays conservative Christians as full of hate and a danger to society.

this film is attempting to promote an agenda.

1)first, gay activists came out of the closet and began to demand their rights in society, work place etc  2)the next step  They are demanding that conservatives (especially those with traditional values) recognize those rights in Churches Private groups (boy scouts, etc) and compromise thier moral values...  The final goal is to make anyone speaking out against the homesexual lifestyle guilty of Discrimination and therefore subject to Civil fines ... this will eventually change from Civil Discrimination to a Criminal offense (hate speech or hate crime legislation) with those speaking out subject to Arrest or Court ordered Re-education training (Diversity /Sensitivity training etc)

to give some real life examples:

in New Mexico, Elaine Photography was found guilty of discrimination for refusing to shoot the commitment ceremony of a lesbian couple; in California a Christian doctor was found guilty of refusing to offer medical services to a lesbian woman who wanted to be artificially inseminated in order to have a baby with her partner; in Massachusetts, elementary school parents were told they did not have the right to keep their children home when homosexual issues were being discussed in class, since same-sex marriage is legal there (not to mention the fact that the courts found it more important to teach children ""diversity"" than to honor the wishes of the parents).

In England, an Anglican Vicar was fined and ordered to undergo equal opportunities training for refusing to hire a gay youth leader; a graduate student in the counseling program at Eastern Michigan University was expelled for refusing to affirm homosexual behavior in a private counseling session; and a Christian pastor in Canada was forbidden from speaking or writing or publishing anything that is critical of homosexual practice after writing a letter to the editor in a local newspaper. in Sweden religous leaders will lose thier license to preach if they state that homosexuality is a sin or immoral lifestyle

is homosexuality a behavour or is a person ""born that way?""

the movie attempts to prove that homosexuality is not a behavour choice but rather the way a person is born and gives some case studies. (the more boys a woman has the greater likelyhood of one being Gay due to her antibodies attacking a male fetus.. if a woman has twins one is Gay their is a 70% chance the 2nd twin will also be gay etc)

let's assume Gay's are ""born this way"".. it doesn't matter.. the U.S. Dept of Health (HHS.GOV) states that around 3% of the population is Gay. Clearly not the majority, male/female relations are required to continue the human race without the use of modern medicine.  so we are talking about an abnormality... similar to Down Syndrome, mental retardation etc people with these conditions shouldn't be hated, but helped to deal with thier disablity. either by counseling to understand why your having these feelings, or helping to live in mainstream society.

what should a traditional Christians do?

to be VERY Clear: we are not endorsing Violance against anyone. we are speaking out against Behavour  This is NOT a Civil Rights issue, (not based on the color of your skin, your physical gender M/F - You can't tell a person is Gay just by looking at them)it is one of Behavour & Actions. Catholic Priests choose to practice Abstinence to increase thier spirituality  According to the Bible Unmarried singles, Homosexuals shouldn't be engaging in sexual activity.. it doesn't matter what your feeling are or the thoughts in your head... a 16yr old boy wants to makeout with his Prom date.. it feels right to him ...it's still wrong.. (see provb 14:12) reading pornography, masterbation is also commdemmned (Matt 5:27-28)

What is a Bible Marriage?

The Bible defines Marriage initially as Adam & Eve (one man & one women) NOT Adam & Steve... or Eve & Kristy.. the Old testiment does have cases where One man was married to several Women.. (personally I think any Guy agreeing to this is crazy)

But I thought God loves everyone? can a Gay person be Christian?

absolutely true.. God Loves everyone, it is our behavour & actions.. perhaps your purpose in life isn't to be married or have a family, you could have a higher calling in fact people that overcome Same gender attraction or great temptations in thier life recieve Special blessing from God (see James 1:12-16) sex isn't required to express love.. countless examples of this exist.",1242000000,13,4663,4.992258064516129

3029124,1,B000YHQNCI,"Several people have commented on this film as being ""bridge-building"" etc. I would say that this film is likely to make great strides in healing the rifts between gay activists and the Christian right... in much the same way that racial slurs heal tensions between ethnic groups. I am not Evangelical, but I could think of no better words to describe the portrayal of Evangelicals in this film than ""insensitive and hateful."" It was obvious that many hours of footage were taken, and then culled, Michael Moore-style, to select those bits that most make Evangelicals look ignorant and ridiculous. As a piece of ""preaching to the choir"" propaganda, it has obviously struck a chord, but this is a film for making homosexuals and heterodox Christians feel better about themselves. Please do not make the mistake of thinking that it clarifies any important subject, or that it would strike an orthodox Christian as anything but crude and offensive.

The claims to Biblical ""scholarship"" are nothing short of absurd. The Old Testament passages are treated in a very kindergarten way, glazing over the complex relationship between the Old Law and the New as though it were insignificant, when in fact that is critical to any evaluation of the moral teachings found in the Old Testament. Much, much worse though was the treatment of St. Paul's writings, which was so ludicrous that they evidently couldn't find a single scholar to speak for it, though they obviously had interviewed some of the most heterodox, liberal Biblical scholars available. The briefest examination of the Greek text, or even just a reading of the full passage in translation, should make it painfully obvious that St. Paul was indeed condemning homosexuality as sinful, not merely unusual. And the other two Pauline passages dealing with homosexuality are simply not addressed. A *very* charitable interpretation might have the filmmakers merely deeply confused on this point, though really, it seems much more likely that they are simply dishonest.

But this brings me back to my main point. What, really, is the point of this charade? St. Paul clearly condemned homosexuality; only the wildest delusions could bring one to believe otherwise. But surely the people who made this film, and most of the ones who liked it, are not the sort to lose sleep over something like that. One can hardly imagine that *they* have any strong commitment to Biblical inerrancy! So why can't they just content themselves with the usual, ""St. Paul had some fine moral teachings, but unfortunately also adopted some prejudices common to his day blah blah blah"" and leave it at that?

The answer: this film isn't just about affirming homosexuals. It's about making them feel good at the expense of orthodox Christians. It's no fun to think that Christians might actually have some legitimate concerns about sexual morality, or a perspective worth taking seriously. Much better to portray them as hypocritical idiots who don't even know their own holy book! And of course, in making these childish jibes, the film is disrespecting one of the very things that is most sacred to serious Christians.

In short, this film is hateful, offensive and deeply dishonest.",1236816000,36,3209,5.071969696969697
3029125,4,B000YHQNCI,"For the Bible Tells Me So is a documentary that provides an overview of the debate regarding homosexuality and how it is not approved within the pages of the bible.  Sure, religion has been used as an excuse to segregate, murder, and enslave whole groups of people for centuries but at least up until the last one hundred years or so; those Christian knew their bible verses quite well.  They honored their rigid canon and seemed to know their own propaganda a bit more than today's multitude of illiterate bible thumpers and religious politicians.  I always wondered why the nice Christians out there weren't a little bit more upset over this.

Anyway, For the Bible Tells Me So makes a very keen observation; politicizing the bible for anti-gay purposes can be equated to politicizing the bible for those of us who are troubled by other abominations.  The film sites other abominations in Leviticus that can probably be equated to homosexuality and some of them are ridiculous.  Unfortunately most of the sheep in this culture probably only associate the term abomination with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incredible-Hulk/dp/B001DHXT1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incredible Hulk</a>'s arch-nemesis.  So really, almost anything can be denounced by the bible for political purposes.  Now, as a human being, my knee jerk reaction to the fact that the bible indicates we should execute homosexuals isn't whether or not we should follow the word of god here but instead, whether or not we should consider some elements of the bible not only obsolete but offensive to the peace of humanity, so take that for what it is.  I really appreciated the film's interviews with bible scholars who do find massive value in the book everyday but do not agree with the ideas this film attacks regarding homosexuality.  For the Bible Tells Me So does not fiercely attack religion per se, and for that it gains even more credibility in my eyes. Instead, the movie pushes an agenda of its own and asks that Christianity actually accept homosexuality by demonstrating the few denominations that already have, among other points.  At least that is kind of what I got out of it.  It is a fascinating topic and it turns out to be a really fascinating perspective, but overall, the way the bible is politicized is unfair to both homosexuals and to many Christians.

There are some really powerful stories about real people here and I think that is why I found this film so compelling.  I don't like to let my opinion slip out too often, especially when we are just talking about a movie here, but I am absolutely convinced that homosexuality is not a choice.  Let's assume that's true for a minute and consider the suicide rate of homosexuals.  I'm convinced something is wrong here and films like this might help us work toward understanding each other more.

3029129,5,B000YHQNCI,"""For the Bible Tells Me So"" (FBTMS) by director Daniel Karslake is an interesting movie on many levels.  Most superficially, it is a documentary illustrating how many religious leaders have held aloft homosexuality as a convenient demon through which to influence their flock.  Through candid interviews with several individuals and their parents, the movie follows the personal evolution of families that are coming to gripes with the realization that their child is not straight.  More fascinating is that three of these families contain parents and/or children who are practicing pastors or ministers.

Gene Robinson ignited waves of controversy, discussion, and hatred when he was elected as a bishop in the Anglican Church in 2004.  The issue was that Bishop Gene Robinson was an openly gay, non-celibate priest.  In several interviews with him and his parents, we have a glimpse into the spiritual torture of a man who suffers inner torment as he confronts his failed marriage, his parents, and finally his faith after he accepts who he is.  We are able to share in his ultimate vindication towards the end of the film as he is ushered in as bishop, not to cries of rage, but to cheers of joy.

Chrissy Gephardt, daughter of yesteryear's presidential hopeful Richard Gephardt, brings the viewer along during her struggle with sexuality.  Chrissy also encounters anguish within a loving, but passionless, marriage.  Ultimately, she informs her parents that she is gay--far from rejecting her, they embrace their daughter and offer her a place on the presidential-election campaign staff.  In her own words, she felt acceptance beyond anything she had expected during the campaign.

Delving deeper into the movie, the viewer is presented arguments which attack two of the fundamentalist's core messages:  that homosexuality is explicitly stated as evil in the Bible, and that the Sodom and Gomorrah stories were primarily about homosexuality and ""perversion.""  Critics attest that the rule found in Leviticus that demands capital punishment for those who are homosexual has to be examined contextually, instead of literally.  They go on to argue that many other rules in Leviticus also threaten death for a variety of other rather mundane activities, such as eating shrimp or working on the Sabbath.  Biblical scholars from both sides also debate the current belief in academia that Sodom and Gomorrah were actually destroyed over differences in tribal custom--one being the tradition of inviting strangers into the home, of all things.

It is a familiar argument to anyone having difficulties parsing the inherent contradiction in interpreting the Bible literally--you must literally believe everything in the Bible to truly be a literalist.  So why, one may ask, is the Bible being waved around as ""proof"" that homosexuality is evil if it is clear that you cannot base modern behavior on millennia-old dictates?  This film suggests that those who use the Bible in this manner are not intellectually honest, or honorable, folk.

FBTMS challenges viewers to answer three questions:  why do you believe, what do you believe, and how did you come to your belief regarding homosexuality?  Through interviews and personal stories, the story told is that homophobia is exactly that:  ""the state of fearing that which is homosexual.""  The filmmakers suggest that this fear is lent religious credence with a few scattered Biblical quotations mixed with earnest sermons from influential ministers.  This is a stunning argument when examined--are religious leaders really just wrapping up a primitive fear in the coating of malleable religious dogma?

Other issues explored are the choice/no-choice controversy, ""homosexual rehabilitation,"" and hate crimes.  This movie delivers its message in a scholarly, passionate, subtle, and sublime fashion.  The message is simple.  Love--of parents, of neighbors, of community, and of tolerance--is the answer.  Daniel Karslake directs this masterfully, as too-often an ""informative"" film can quickly deteriorate into preachy, irritating material that is off-message.  This documentary is highly recommended to everyone, especially those willing to see a movie that avoids annoying methods of argumentation while still delivering a powerful message of tolerance.",1227312000,3,4298,5.447129909365559

3029134,5,B000YHQNCI,"The feature length documentary, For the Bible Tells Me So, takes a journey into the lives of five Christian families who raised gay or lesbian children. Two of the five families are prominent families in the US: former Presidential candidate Dick Gephardt and his family and the first openly gay Episcopal bishop Gene Robinson and his family. The documentary follows each family as they begin to process their child's sexual orientation, with each family responding in a variety of ways, from complete acceptance to loving tolerance to rejection and judgment.
 In the end, For the Bible Tells Me So is unambiguously pro-gay in its approach to the topic. A large majority of the scholars who provide interpretations of the six or seven biblical passages concerning homosexuality conclude that monogamous homosexual relationships can be supported by the church without betraying biblical honesty. While their arguments are compelling, perhaps the most compelling aspect of this film is the love and compassion these families show for one another in stark opposition to the hatred and vengeance the Church shows toward homosexuals. This message is not only a powerful reminder for the Church but a call to true Christ-like compassion that has been lacking in this area.
 The only weakness of this film is the lack of healthy dialog between the liberal and conservative approaches to the topic. It is clear the film makers want to begin the dialog between homosexuals and the church, yet the film is probably too polarizing for this to take place. For most viewers of the film, it will be either a celebrated commentary on the validity of homosexuality or, to borrow a term used often in the film, a pure abomination.",1224460800,4,1713,5.049469964664311

3029140,4,B000YHQNCI,"I watched this documentary as part of the book tour that Gene Robinson was on.  Watching it and then hearing Gene speak was incredible.  The high-energy hate of the film followed by the calm (though no less passioned) talk that Gene gave was an interesting juxtaposition.  Of course, the movie is about Gene Robinson's life and consecration as Bishop of New Hampshire (in the Episcopal Church).  But it is much more than that.  It is about the struggle of homosexuals, and also of those who love and care about them, while not understanding nor accepting their orientation.  It specifically presents the rhetoric of the religious right, and and how their scriptural logic is flawed.  Also, while the movie focuses on bigotry against homosexuals, you can't help but recognize that this is the same hatefulness that has worked hard to keep Blacks and other minorities subjugated.  We see the same thing at work today against Mexicans and others.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to hear the 'other side of the story'.  The anguish of the parents in the movie is palpable; it really shows the humaness of everyone who has to deal with this issue day-in and day-out.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it is 1.5 hrs long, which is a bit long.

3029141,5,B000YHQNCI,"This powerful and courageous video exposes the Fundamental Christian Right and other traditional organized religious venues for what they really are, as well as de-bunking their twisted logic, in an objective, academic and empiracal fashion, relative to the alleged ""Words of God"", via the Scriptures.

The credible, thoughtful and realistic interpretations of the Biblical lines that the hateful/Old Testament autocrats use to freely admonish the ideologies associated with same-sex relationships, are skillfully presented in a creative and culturally time-sensitive fashion that is holistic, insightful and transcends the anal and restrictive mindsets associated with ""Old Time Religion"", thus guiding Compassionate and ""Christ-like"" minded human beings into the 21st century.

Families that have experienced the heartache, pain, suffering and social sitigmatization that comes from the hateful rhetoric and shamful osterization energies that spew from those that ""judge & condem"" others who condone same-sex relationships, share their first-hand immersion experiences in a frank and forthright way.  The powerful testimonials are gut-wrenching, profound, and at times, brought tears to my eyes as I empathized with them, being a parent and loving father.

Watching the families deal with their crisis and finding the courage and strength to arrive at the Christ-centered conclusion that, regardless of the torment that may have occured because of their child's ""choices"", thier child is ALWAYS their child and worthy of their UNCONDITIONAL LOVE!

It was refreshing to share the family's experiences, as they embraced life with zest and zeal, as they were willing to grow spiritually, accepting and loving their offspring, as being one of God's children, in spite of their gender specific choices.  It took real courage and genuine parental love for the families involved, to whom traditional relationships were the norm, to reaffirm and validate the passion  that emanates from the love of one's child, as only a mother and father can know.  Kudos to those wonderful parents!

What a travesty, actually an abomination that shames our great nation, as a few well-placed omniscient, seemingly omnipotent and self-proclaimed experts (such as Dr. James Dobson, Jimmy Swaggart and others), due to their high-visibility stations-in-life, often as alleged religious leaders, teachers, and spiritual mentors, have abused their powers.  They have perpetuated the hateful, condescendingly judgmental and negative energies, acting as official monikders for the Almighty Ineffable, who have destroyed families and fueled the rage in the less-stable ""Christo-Fascists"" that perpetrate the increasing number of horrific hate crimes that are directed towards those that engage-in and/or support-same sex relationships.

This DVD is a riveting, no-nonsense and sorely needed vehicle for positive change for all civilized and decent people who have an inherent sense of Reverence and Spirituality.  More importantly, it is also a powerful wake-up call for the so-called Traditionalists who are driven by Old Testament energies that reek with the cruel ""fire and brimstone"" payback mind-sets that one will ""go to hell"" for same-sex interests.  It may also encourage those that engage in rote and simplistic behaviors that are ""preached"" weekly in Church by the so-called Evangelicals and Ministers of organized religious venues that are often more interested in their own self-serving agendas and financial gains, as opposed to offering genuine spiritual guidance for the masses, to perhaps ""re-consider"" and reflect on thier own spiritual journey relative to Enlightment and Salvation.

Additionally, the video reminds us that the old adage that states that the greatest problem with the Church is the Chruch, is worth a second look.  Too often, the politics associated with traditional organized religious venues, spill-over into a hateful divisveness that perpetuates an ""us and them"" mentality where each venue claims to have the ONLY way to Salvation and Heaven.  Sadly, the language of the so-called Judeo Christian Bible was written in the context of a reality that existed some 2000 years ago.  As society and Culture evolved, progressed and grew with the times, too many of the ""quoted"" biblical lines have been either taken out of context or interpreted in a restrictive and unrealistic fashion that are misleading and simply dead wrong! Just as beauty is said to be in the eyes of the beholder, perhaps TURTH lies in the eyes(soul) of the beholder, as well.

In the end, I doubt that a personal God works to inform us, day to day, about how we should behave, relative to societal norms, politics and cultural constructs.  Freedeom for Americans allows for CHOICES in the domain of man-made rules, social order and in civilized living matters.  ""Because the Bible tells me so"", is quite possibly the greatest impetus for all of God's children to observe and to LIVE The Golden Rule as the best guide towards Englightenment and Salvation!  THANKS!

A wonderfully written documentary on the struggle for spiritual equality for gay and lesbian christians.

In this film families of lesbian, gay, and bisexual Christian children share their struggle with understanding God's will concerning homosexuality and also their difficulties with accepting their children. The movie is most powerful because of the honesty and vulnerability of the families. The two screenings I was at, though, were probably attended by people who are already affirming. This movie needs to be seen by parishioners in every church--affirming or not, so that people know the struggle of LGBT Christians everywhere. I truly believe this story has the power and beauty to change people's hearts.

3029144,2,B000YHQNCI,"I liked this film because it challenges one to think.  However, I think its portrayal of what the Bible says about homosexuality is very lopsided.  The argument of the film relies mainly upon emotion and opinion than what the Bible actually says.  What little it does allow the Bible to speak it does so in a very bias manner.  I would have liked to see some dialogue between the two sides presented in a balanced fashion.  Perhaps some scholarship on the original texts of Hebrew and Greek would have served well.  Overall, it challenges Christians to see that this issue is not as clear cut as they would like to believe, but its weakness is that it opens questions that are never answered, namely the title.

There have been a few criticisms that it's a bit one sided, and you know what, it's true. It's true because this is a film that's only being told by one side of the equation, so naturally, it will only be the opinions, beliefs and feelings of those who have continually felt the negative effects of bigoted Christianity in their lives. It's not the filmmakers job to be completely balanced, not every story is fair. Surely, what the men and women went through in this film wasn't fair, so to chide the film for not being completely fair to Christianity is a bit insulting to the integrity of the entire piece.

I just want to mention that it's impossible to measure the damage done to gays and their families by Dobson's media empire and his perverse theology that teaches homophobia.

I visited ""Focus on the Family"" once, and was shocked by the literature that was crafted to create fear towards gays.  It was not dissimilar to how Jews were once spoken about, or how immigrants are framed as threats to America (never mind that they pick our food, and take care of our children, and mow our lawns, etc).  Time and again, elites and their media are dividing people, in order to more easily control them.  It's a game as old as empire.  Thankfully, we have DVDs like ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" to counter the divisive preaching of people like Dobson and Rod Parsley (who recently declared that ""we get off on warfare""), and the propaganda of radio hosts like Dennis Prager and Rush Limbaugh.
Let's get this film shown in as many classrooms as possible.  If you can, buy extra copies and donate them to second-hand stores, or send some copies to U.S. troops through projects like ""Books for Soldiers.""

3029151,5,B000YHQNCI,"""For the Bible Tells Me So"" is a wonderful documentary based on life experiences from a broad spectrum of those involved in the topic of gay/lesbian acceptance with the overwhelming dynamic of a religious background.

What impressed me the most about this film was the variety of scholars interviewed and the powerful explanations behind the historical and cultural context of the usual scriptures used by everyday persons of Judeo-Christian upbringing to discriminate and justify their prejudice toward gays and lesbians.

For anyone wanting to consider other viewpoints, or even challenge their own with regard to the topic of homosexuality and their faith, this film is a must-see.",1214179200,6,684,5.383177570093458
3029152,4,B000YHQNCI,"""For the Bible Tells Me So"" is a documentary purporting to refute those who claim the Bible condemns homosexuality.  Thought provoking and compassionate toward those who are gay and who are suffering oppression because of it, the film left me conflicted.

On the one hand, I do feel compassion for the pain that gays experience because of their orientation, compassion for the families who have lost loved ones to suicide or who have broken relationships.  On the other hand, I feel the movie demonizes the church by painting it with a ovrly broad brush that is more appropriately reserved to one fundamentalist, literalistic slice.

Put differently, it is no more accurate to see The Church as a monolithic entity than it is to put The Gays into one stereotypical bucket.  The truth is that many strands of the church are struggling - albeit unsuccessfully - with inclusion of gays and acceptance of them.  The fact that the Episcopal Church ordained a gay Bishop illustrates the progress made but also the distance left to travel.

Further, there is no denying that - in both the Old and New Testaments - the Bible has something to say about homosexuality, and that something is consistently condemnatory.  There are ""contextual"" attempts to dilute the ""abomination"" label or to explain away the condemnation.  Whether you find these explanations compelling may depend on what side of the divide you stand on.  Further, the efforts at being confrontational and demonizing the likes of James Dobson risks putting gays into the same oppression mode as their purported fundamentalist enemies.  In such a way, the gay movement threatens to become a mirror image of that which it purports to hate.

Again, this is a thought-provoking documentary with a clear point of view ion the issue.  It hopefully can lead to constructive - not confrontational - dialogue between Christians and gays, not as mutually exclusive factions but as overlapping groups.",1214006400,5,1947,5.046875
3029153,3,B000YHQNCI,"Many people may be confused with the definition of sin and the Bible's opinion.  This film makes certain points some of them accurate most of them built on flawed theology.  It completely ignores the center argument which is that homosexuality was dangerous in the Old Testament so therefore God attacked it possibly to limit disease.  Now in modern times God still disagrees with homosexuality but he no longer needs people to attack them.  I found it ludacris that this film claimed the ""Old Testament"" God only harmed gays for ""ceremonial"" and customary reasons.  No God-respecting or self-respecting Christian could possibly believe this.  The obvious center argument is that homosexuality is still a sin but God wants only the perfect to cast the first stone.

Many people use the argument that Jesus refused to condemn gays, they ignored the fact that Jesus refused to condemn anyone.  Think about the most depraved sin you can think of; guess what, Jesus came not to condemn those people.  To say Jesus did not condemn gays is a moot point to trick people who don't study the Bible. The film also jokes that normal people should not study the Bible, it even in joke form references the fact that the Pope made it illegal for the common man to read the Bible. (And ignored what the Pope did to the millions of people who felt they needed to read the Bible to gain a personal relationship with God. The real reason why the Pope tried to prevent people from reading the Bible is because his universal Roman church's theology clearly contradicted the Bible and he wanted to retain power, by selling indulgences and such. This film ignores this.)

It is possible that God defines a sin as anything ""bad.""  If you study the Bible you may realize that most of the Leviticus laws are actually health laws. The vast majority of the Leviticus health laws are proven accurate.  These laws would have prevented a vast amount of human disease and suffering. So therefore it is possible that eating shrimp is dangerous because they are bottom feeders in the ocean.

How should a Christian react to sin? Well it is impossible not to sin.  But the first aspect of Christianity is to admit that you are sinful.  This is the main problem with the homosexual sin.  They can't admit that God may not have intended them to be that way and their lifestyle is just a result of human evil.

The obvious response to this movie from a Christian perspective is that being gay is still sin but so is sex outside of marriage and eating pork.  The first step to respecting Christ is the willingness to accept that you are an imperfect sinner.  The main contradiction with homosexuals and the Bible is they have choosen to reject the idea that their nature is sinful this is something that all Christians should accept.  What is the next step after admitting that you are a sinner you ask.  Well that is between you and your personal God.

I found the scientific definition of those kinds of people interesting this is something I had wondered about.  But at the end of the day, I would have to say that homosexality is a sin and a result of sin.  This scientific explanation does not contradict the Bible.  Science has also shown people are prone to violence and also cancer so explaining homosexuality scientifically, even though quite interesting, does not disprove the Bible's claim.",1212537600,8,3363,4.717465753424658

3029158,5,B000YHQNCI,This documentary deals with the insane idea that you can take the Bible literally from beginning to end.  It also shows how the Bible has been used to support all kinds of prejudice by selectively picking out passages and ignoring others. The Bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals.  Funny how lopsided these admonishments have become. This is a great tool to help gay people deal with religious fanatics in their lives.,1209513600,8,468,5.144736842105263

3029160,3,B000YHQNCI,"Don't watch this documentary film if you expect anything like a balanced treatment of homosexuality and Christianity. It's aggressively polemical, it incorporates all the worst examples of Christian hate and extremism, it omits any treatment of gay extremists like you might see in San Francisco's Gay Pride Parade, and in several instances it presents ""experts"" without identifying them as aggressively pro-gay (eg, Peter Gomes of Harvard). But there's a good reason to watch this film, nevertheless, because it presents the personal stories of five families, without exception all of which are deeply Christian, and how they dealt with the news that their kids are gay. Two of the families are famous-- Chrissy Gephardt is the daughter of two-time presidential candidate and Missouri congressman Dick Gephardt, and Gene Robinson became the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church. Jake comes from the suburbs of Minneapolis, Tonia is an African-American who grew up on a dirt road in North Carolina before going to Yale, and then Anna was from Arkansas. These families run the Christian gamut -- United Church of Christ, African-American, Lutheran, Catholic, and fundamentalist, and they respond to their child's coming out in different ways. It's a shame that the film makers resorted to predictable polemic instead of trusting the power of these deeply moving stories.",1208822400,12,1380,5.364055299539171

Many people address different aspects (I won't say both sides, because it's more complicated than that) of religion vs. homosexuality, old ways vs. new thinking, and the journeys that families go through when a spouse or child comes out.

There is no voice-over from the filmmakers; they allow the subjects to speak for themselves, and this is quite effective; we can make up our own minds and ponder what they've said instead of being told what to think.

The story of Jay Reitan and his parents attempting to get their story to James Dobson at Focus on the Family was particularly moving.  Sadly, someone like Dobson has already made up his mind on the issue and is unwilling to consider anyone else's experience.

Some people may not care about this subject and some may out and out refuse to go, but much like another recent documentary ""No End in Sight"" which tackled a very sensitive and divisive issue on the Iraq War,now ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" brings a similar understanding,very fair,balanced,level-headed and fact-wielding that should not be offensive or polarizing, but rather informative,illuminating and ultimately healing.

Christians who believe in the historical understanding of the Bible's condemnation of homosexuality are presented as ignorant, 'fundamentalists,' 'literalists', and are lumped together with radical fringe groups (e.g. the vicious Westboro Baptist Church) who picket and scream at homosexuals. There is no attempt at fairness or evenhandedness in the presentation of Biblical interpretation or the normal Christian who believes the Bible but does not hate and fear homosexuals. It seems to me that only those who are looking for the Bible to support their predetermined conclusions about sexuality would consider this an adequate treatment of the Bible's teaching on homosexuality.

This gives them somewhat of a pass. But how can you title the movie ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" when you don't know anything about the Bible?) A man in the film claimed that the word ""abomination"" in the Bible only applies to Jewish rituals and not innate moral issues. That's of course a bold-faced lie. The Bible refers to bestiality, sacrificing children to false gods and fornication as an ""abomination."" Those are moral issues and not Jewish rituals or customs.

The movie refers to outdated science on studies involving twins. The latest studies on identical twins shows that homosexuality is not genetic. Dr. Neil Whitehead, PhD. says Because they have identical DNA, it ought to be 100%. But the studies reveal something else. If an identical twin has same-sex attraction the chances the co-twin has it are only about 11% for men and 14% for women. Because identical twins are always genetically identical, homosexuality cannot be genetically dictated. No-one is born gay, he notes. The predominant things that create homosexuality in one identical twin and not in the other have to be post-birth factors.

The fact remains that there are a lot of people who have innate desires to various sexual things. This includes pedophilia, incest, bestiality and having multiple husbands or wives. No one would argue that because these desires are innate means they were born this way or that their actions are permissable.",1432166400,9,1592,4.9588014981273405

3263508,1,B000YHQNCI,"There seemed to be three major points in this film: the first is stated in my title, the second is that it is wrong to treat homosexuals violently; and it is wrong for Christians to force their beliefs on others.

I agree with points two and three. Point one, however, I will not agree with.
Consider some of the Apostle Paul's words, similar words can be found in many of his epistles:
1Co 6:9  Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
1Co 6:10  nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
1Co 6:11  And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

 I don't think that these words leave much room for redefinition of the sin of homosexuality. And it is not the only sin that believers are suppose to forsake as they grow in grace. In the beatitudes, Jesus describes what a Christian is. He is poor in spirit, mourns his sin, becomes meek because he discovers that he is spiritually bankrupt and sins incessantly, he begins to seek God's righteousness....

 So, a chief problem that the Christian believer has that shapes his entire walk, his sanctification, is his personal sinfulness.

 The Bible has a solution for sin! That solution is not to redefine it so that you can believe that you are good, or so that you can be socially acceptable--politically correct. The solution is to identify sin by viewing it in terms of God's criteria found in the 10 commandments; confess it to God; accept the forgiveness offered via God the Father's mercy via Christ's atoning work; seek the grace of God offered via his MEANS of Grace (hearing preaching; praying; reading scripture; fellowshiping with other believers around the scripture; participating in the Lord's table; and baptism). Through these means, God humbles a believer and He also REVEALS Christ to him which changes him.

 Furthermore, and most importantly, the Bible indicates that God is merciful to those who repent and seek His forgiveness and the forsaking of their sins. Psalms 51 and 32 are prime examples of this mercy, there are many others throughout the Bible. You get no mercy if you deny, or cover you sin. That judgment might be of the variety that you are given over to it to the point of being consumed by it. There are various forms of God's judgment illustrated in the pages of scripture.

 There are words in the Bible to describe exactly what is going on in this movie. Here are two examples of those words:
Isa 5:20  Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! [God has defined in the Bible just what good and evil are, those who change that definition are spoken of herein.]
Isa 9:16  for those who guide this people have been leading them astray, and those who are guided by them are swallowed up.
The books of kings in the Bible give many examples of the people being led astray by their leaders while they thought they were worshiping God.

The Christian church is filled with heresy and apostasy, that has been true since the beginning. The epistles of the Apostles deal with various kinds of heresy. The only sure way to know how to worship God is found in the scripture. There are study Bibles that have reliable interpretations of scripture, unlike those illustrated in this film.",1423008000,6,3587,4.650316455696203

3263514,5,B000YHQNCI,"For The Bible Tells Me So is an uncommonly moving and powerful documentary concerning the gay offspring of Fundamentalist Christians and their family dynamics.

As the film opens, we meet several older Conservative Christians and their gay children.  The parents talk about their reaction to their childs coming out and the children talk about their experience in breaking the news.  One of the families is that of James D. Robinson, the first openly gay Bishop in the Episcopal Church.  The director, Daniel Karslake, has been careful to select families of an extremely conservative nature.  In addition to the families, several gay activists and sympathetic religious leaders are also interviewed, and clips are shown of fire-and-brimstone sermons by anti-gay preachers.

Biblical texts are examined and discussed.  Why is it, for example, that anti-gay religious people always point to the prohibition in Leviticus about men who lie with men but manage to overlook the prohibitions in the same chapter about eating shrimp and sowing two crops in the same field?  As for the New Testament, one of the women interviewed points out that the Bible says to sell all you have and give to the poor.  Yet, as she says, who says, Im going to close all my bank accounts and give all my money away?  And any person who has really studied the Bible can tell you that the true sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were that of inhospitality.  As one commentator says, The Bible has been used throughout history to discriminate  its an old trick fundamentalists have used before, and now they're doing it again.

A Gay Cartoon tackles the subject, Is it a choice and points out that research shows that, among identical twins, if one sibling is gay, there is a 70% chance that the other will be as well.  Gay children, psychologists tell us, can learn to hate themselves because of their familys or clergys reaction to their coming out.  Indeed, we see the very sad story of a mother who learned too late; her inability to accept her daughters lifestyle led to her daughters suicide.  She laments, What Ive learned is that, instead of taking the bible literally, I must consider it in the context and culture of which it was written.

What is most striking is that all of the families portrayed here have slowly come to accept their children for who they are.  Unconditional love is just that  love without conditions.  For the Bible Tells Me So is a film that all people of faith who have gay children need to see.

Highly recommended.",1417478400,2,2515,4.8023255813953485

Within the first few minutes of the movie, there was a quote that really stuck out to me: This country is doing everything it can to make it seem like it is okay to be gay, and its not. When I heard this I was shocked. How could someone say something so harsh and horrible? Throughout the movie, there were several families with a homosexual son or daughter. Most of the parents mentioned that when their child came out, they referred to the Bible. Leviticus 20:13 states, If a man also lie with man and a woman also lie with woman, both of them are committing an abomination. They shall be put to death, their blood is upon them. Despite the fact that I am apart of the Catholic community, I had never once before heard of this verse. I feel as though the church portrays homosexuality as a sin that should be punished with death. I find this ridiculous. Overall, I thought this movie was intriguing and gave a new perspective on homosexuality (interviews of Christian parents of homosexuals) that I had never seen before.",1401753600,,1224,4.542986425339366

There is no attempt to present a balanced presentation. No former homosexuals are interviewed, no commentators who would explain why the clear teaching that ""a man should not lie with a man as one would with a woman"" are interviewed.

It is a well done video with engaging personalities that serves as a propaganda piece to promote homosexuality as a genetically determined lifestyle.

3263564,1,B000YHQNCI,"I found the beginning of the film to be the most interesting, when the families were describing their history and relationship with their churches. The part where it started to confuse me was when the film started to question what the bible's passages on homosexuality actually say. Should it be read literally or is it dependent upon cultural, individual interpretation?

I think that if a person wants to believe in the bible, they should believe in what the bible has written down. There might be room and leeway for some interpretation (as with all books), but to try and make the jump from the bible condemning homosexuality to accepting/or not mentioning it...that seems like a far stretch to me. It seems as if some of the people in the film are choosing what they want to believe and then trying to find a way to fit the bible around it...shouldn't it be the other way around? If you are going to be Christian, shouldn't you look at what the bible says, and then live life in accordance with what it proclaims?

Either way...there is some cognitive dissonance going on. I would have preferred more balance and objectivity to the film. The film has a tremendous pro-gay bias and it's main purpose is to remove homophobia.",1349049600,17,1228,4.706976744186046

3263566,5,B000YHQNCI,"Clearly the main point is to break down the interpretation walls that lead conservatives to hate without really knowing anything more than what they have been taught through generations, but as a liberal agnostic (raised in a strictly Catholic family) I ended up with an enlightened view myself. Before this documentary I felt the Bible was just a book that caused issues through out society excusing all kinds of wrong doing in the name of God. I now see I a was just as lost as my conservative extremist counterparts.

This documentary helped me realize the Bible is much like everything we read or watch, the message is in the eye of the beholder. The black lesbian woman helped me realize this when she mentioned the messages she gets when she reads the Bible in contrast to a white straight man. I realized that this happens all the time, I watched Drive and I ended up loving the message it carried, when at the beginning of the film he asks the kid (while watching cartoons) ""how do you know he's the bad guy?"" and the kind answers ""he's a shark"" and then he asks back ""so all sharks are bad?"". It was so deep in my eyes the way we put characters (and people)in boxes, as if everything is black and white when in fact there is a lot of grey. Anyway, my friend hated the movie, said that it was way too much gore and killing, which reminds me of this topic. We both watched the movie but got completely different messages from it, just like when each of us read the Bible (or any religious book for that matter).

Also, it's so important to take context into the interpretation, I mean, let's say the Bible said it is an abomination for anyone to have a booty, in our time a booty is a rear-end, when the original word refers to a stolen treasure. So as much as a stubborn mind wants to deny it, figures of speech were different then than now what is important is to try to get the inspiring message from what we watch and read instead of taking it for face value, which at it's very core about loving and respecting each other even when other's views aren't our own.",1339459200,,2073,4.367875647668394
3263567,5,B000YHQNCI,"Believe it or not, this is a very inspiring movie. It doesn't start out that way, with all this anti-homosexual rhetoric, especially by fundamentalist preachers. But we meet the families of gay men and women, the gay and lesbians they have come to understand and accept, and the ways in which they have helped bring LGBT rights to the forefront of public awareness.

Take Gene Robinson, for example, the first openly gay Episcopalian bishop (New Hampshire), and indeed the first in the entire Anglican communion. His parents and his ex-wife are included in the movie, talking at length about how they came to accept that he was gay. And ultimately, how they were supportive of his election to Bishop even in the face of death threats (he wore a bullet-proof vest under his cassock at the ritual) and an army of reporters and cameras.

Chrissy Gephardt, lesbian daughter of Dick Gephardt, talking about her life and how it impacted and was impacted by her father's run for the presidential nomination.

Rondi and Phil Reitan had a charming young son. They were plenty shook up when he told them he was gay, and decided they had to become informed about the facts of homosexuality. What they learned was so very different from what James Dobson had told them on ""Focus on the Family"" that they decided to take the fight for gay rights to him. They wrote a letter which they read to the crowd, and the police told them that if they crossed onto Dobson's property, they would be arrested. Mrs. Reitan decided she had to deliver the letter, and she and her husband and her son were indeed arrested. Do you think Dobson got the message?

Brenda and David Poteet, very conservative black Christians, also appear in the film and talk frankly about their lesbian daughter. They will go only so far and no further in accepting her ""lifestyle,"" as David puts it, but they love their daughter and they accept her for who she is.

There is a good bit of discussion about the people who claim homosexuality is a choice, that they can be ""cured,"" and that parents should take that approach. This viewpoint is quite thoroughly discredited, including some interesting current scientific evidence that birth order is one of the important causes for gay males especially. It seems a mother's body treats the maleness of a fetus as an alien invasion. The more often she has boys, the more her body adapts by feminizing the fetus. Statistically, gay men are more likely to have several older brothers.

The saddest story is a woman whose Lesbian daughter had a hard time with her mother, and eventually committed suicide. After her daughter died, the mother studied the truth about lesbianism and finally became an outspoken advocate for gay rights. She felt her daughter had not died in vain, because she learned to love her and effectively ""make restitution"" for her coldness to her daughter.

This is a very intense movie, and includes quite a few religious leaders, both for and against, who speak their minds about the passages in the Bible that are used to condemn gays. Some important points are made, most poetically by Bishop Desmond Tutu.",1336953600,6,3127,4.779629629629629
3263568,4,B000YHQNCI,"As a young man who regularly attended church and took an active part in the youth ministry, I was really disturbed when I began to suspect I might be gay. Everyone told us that homosexuality was never God's plan, and I had to silently deal with these strange feelings that I felt must be sinful.

Finally, early this month, I came to terms with it: I'm gay and I didn't know what that meant about my faith. My family was fortunately very understanding, and my sister's husband suggested I check out this documentary, especially after a respected church member sent me some rather disturbing and condemning messages.

I watched it alone, and it was really difficult to sit through in many places. I feel the producers were quite varied in their responses and selection of footage: we had the radical Bible-thumping Christians, while also looking at five Christian families who had gay children.

In the stories, I felt I met kindred spirits in them. A lot of their thoughts and fears mirrored my own, so it was wonderful to know that I was not alone in these feelings and wondering if being a gay Christian was even possible.

However, a downside to the even-handedness is that I didn't feel the question was answered clearly. Many interpretations of the Bible's few references to homosexuality are presented, no one interpretation being favored. Overall, I got the message that a passionate love for someone of your own gender is not evil, but the question of intimacy was certainly left ambiguous.

So, while it did help answer some of my questions and let me know I am not alone, I think I'll have to look elsewhere for more answers. A great starting point, I suppose.",1335571200,12,1670,4.725085910652921
3263569,5,B000YHQNCI,"A good friend shared this documentary with me and it blew me away!  The issues of homosexuality, religion and spirituality are approached with such dignity, respect and love, I knew I had to share it with my parents.  I bought it for them and we watched it together over the Christmas holidays.  They already knew about my sexuality, but this allowed us to talk more deeply and we are beginning to recapture some of the closeness we shared before I came out.

I love seeing the 5 different families and hearing their stories - personally it's inspiring to see families growing stronger who (sooner or later) embrace their children's sexuality.  I would recommend this to anyone whose parents or family members are Christian and is dealing with issues of homosexuality.  It is an honest and touching portrayal of families working through their differences in love.

3263570,4,B000YHQNCI,"I agree with the person who said that this doc, though an awesome window into how people have misinterpreted the Bible and have taken things quite literal to tell people what they should think, is somewhat outdated. I'd love a rerelease of this with an update on the families that they focused on.

They mentioned Don't Ask Don't Tell, which since this was release has been repelled (which was a major goal of the Obama Administration). And let's not forget that there have also been several states now that have allowed homosexual marriages. It's funny how 4 or so years can change so much about this culture. Not to mention that Bush was beginning to get vastly unpopular during that time, and liberal voices that championed the idea of religion being misused became mainstream, and that the conservative voices that condemned homosexuality have been on the decline (you hardly hear about James Dobsion anymore unless he's Tebowing).

But all in all, a heart wrenching testament into how many church goers had to think about their beliefs, and what it sometimes takes for someone to really have it sink in that what they believe might not be the right path. I'd advise everyone to watch this, but keep in mind how things have changed since then for homosexuals.

A final word: though clips OF them picketing are seen in this doc, there is no verbal mention of a certain family that lives in Topeka, Kansas that is responsible for said pickets (you'll recognize them right away). Not sure what to say about that omission, because on one hand, that family IS important to such dialogue because of what they've done to get into the spotlight, hut on the other hand, name recognition is all the head of that family needs to continue to do what he does.",1328140800,,1750,4.712418300653595

3263572,4,B000YHQNCI,"While a bit dated, this would be an excellent film for a parent or parents struggling with the sexual orientation of a child or other family member.  Many parents and their children may be devout members of an organized religion that ""condemms the sin, but loves the sinner.""  The knowledge that one of their children may be gay or lesbian is certainly hard to take, but here is help that may put the pain in better perspective.  The ""pick and choose"" use of Liviticus is made quite clear, and how gays have become scapegoats for the sins of others.  There is one strong example of how a parent could not understand or accept her child's orientation until after that child's suicide. She then became an advocate for love and acceptance. This is not a unique situation, and the film just might prevent such a terrible outcome if seen by parents who cannot accept their child or relative's orientation. The film also makes clear that parents should not feel any shame or guilt, but should do all they can to understand and support their loved one - and also will need to accept with love whomever that person chooses as a life partner.  The possibility of love from families and even entire congregations is well documented in the film.  So many suicides by young people might be prevented if only love and acceptance were offered, instead of rigid denial and outright condemnation because of ""the bible tells me so"" rational.  How sad it is that religions still persist in spreading hatred instead of love.",1327363200,2,1505,4.699619771863118

3263577,5,B000YHQNCI,"I was recently looking for a good documentary about religion and social issues to watch and kind of just stumbled upon this one.  I did not realize until 20 minutes into it (lol) that the film deals only with the LGBT community and their parents as it relates to Christianity .  I was very moved and would highly recommend For The Bible Tells Me So to anyone who believes religious text justifies non acceptance and/or discrimination towards the LGBT community.

For The Bible Tells Me So is a documentary which chronicles the plight (and ultimate acceptance) of a handful of baby boomer parents and older of gay and/or lesbian children who initially had negative feelings about their children's sexual orientation due to biblical scripture.  The documentary also references religious scholars who interpret the Bible from both a historically academic point of view (the whole ""time and place"" theory of words and their context during biblical times) as well as a personal religious one often stating that the Bible is a nuanced text that holds different meanings for different readers.  The format of For The Bible Tells Me So shows parents of gay and/or lesbian adult children discussing how deeply steeped in their church communities they are and how sad, angry and confused they were over what they believed the Bible and their church community taught about homosexuality.  Most of the families chronicled seemed more sad and confused but at least tried to understand their children, however one mother was so unaccepting that her daughter wound up committing suicide (it may have not been the only reason, but it probably was part of it).  Ultimately, all of the parents in the film wound up becoming social activists on behalf of the LGBT community even going so far as to march in unity to the headquarters of Focus On The Family to deliver a letter to its founder who literally instructs parents of gay/lesbian children not to accept them so they will ""turn away"" from their ""choice.""

During a time when gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered youth suicide is becoming alarmingly common, it would be helpful for parents of these children (especially the more religious and conservative ones) to take a deep breath, do some reading outside of the church and watch this documentary (I'm sure there are also many others that discuss the same topic that are well rounded) before they make an often stressful and confusing time more stressful and confusing.  :-(

3263578,5,B000YHQNCI,"This is my favorite documentary in years. The families presented here are real, honest and courageous. Their willingness--and unwillingness--to look beyond the literal interpretation of the Bible to the importance of the people they love and the message of God's love was challenging and inspirational. I cried several times as I watched and rewatched it.
The calm presentation by open-hearted theologians and church leaders (including Desmond Tutu who drew the parallel of church-condoned discrimination against gays with past discrimination against blacks) was in stark contrast to the often strident tone of those who condemn gays.
If I could have made one change, it would have been to the beginning. The strong presentation of anti-gay evangelicals belies the heartwarming and uplifting nature of the rest of the film. In sharing it with friends who are conservatively religious--and I believe it needs to be shared--I felt I needed to ask them to ignore the first five minutes.",1313798400,2,983,5.348387096774194
3263579,5,B000YHQNCI,"My review on the movie ""The Matthew Shepard Story, Now I have ordered the movie, but I have watched it several times on Lifetime and I used to watch it on YouTube but they removed it for some reason. I really like the movie myself, I am not a homosexual but I believe that everyone should be treated the same with the exact same respect that others demand to get.

This movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry and most of all it tells you how some people can be as far as treating people just because they happen to be different or gay. What they did to poor Matthew is so unbearable and I don't care what he did, he did not deserve what they did to him, no one deserves that. It's a good thing that Matthews Parents thought with their heart and thought of Matthew when they asked for life in imprisonment not the death penalty.

I have one more thing to say on this subject and that is Matthew Shepard story is about a boy who was different and he had so much love to give someone but did not get the chance, and it is sad that some people are so cruel because they don't understand how someone can be like that, well Matthew did not do anything to anyone except try to fit in somewhere and wanted to make friends and live his life, but that was interrupted because 2 boys decided they was going to play God all because they say that Matthew hit on them, but testimony says different.

What makes anyone else any better than you? They are not. I myself am a homosexual supporter and I do not care if you know my name, and you can call me names I do not care, But I do believe in God and since God does not make mistakes therefore he made everyone in his imaiage and even though some would disagree I believe that God made homosexuals too!

Being born homosexual is not a choice its how it is, and those of you that do not like it..well tough get over it because I am 100% sure there are just as many homosexuals these days as there are homophobic people. You need to take the good with the bad and just hope you fit in somewhere.

Answer this question would you let someone tell you who you can be with? even if you are of age? I doubt anyone of you would. I think that ANYONE should be able to marry anyone as long as they are of age, it should not matter if its 2 men or 2 women or man and woman. It should be up to the person and that is it.

I am sorry for those of you think because the bible says one thing, considering that book was wrote how long ago and its the old testament anyways, and this is 2011 not the beginning of time.

I hope I did not offend anyone that was not why I said what I did.

3263581,5,B000YHQNCI,"This very, very good documentary film, ""for the Bible Tells me so"" shows us five (5) families (4 that come from extremely religious back grounds) seeking answers about homosexuality mainly from the Bible (which has been a  very important ""guide"" in their lives) on the subject because they have found out that a beloved family member is gay.  This film ""cuts"" through all previous rhetoric that has been screamed and taught about the aforesaid subject by so-called""Bble experts"".  The passages in the Bible that supposedly condemn homosexuality are re-examined, closely scrutinized and re-read  with some very surprising results for each of the families  that tell their stories in this documentary.  I came to the conclusion after viewing this film that the answer to all of ""gay questions"" is very simple, love.  That's really the answer all of the 5 families found to be true that it all comes down to loving NOT hating.  All of the families stories (especially the Richard Gephardt and Episcopal Archbishop, Gene Richardson ) were very touching proving through their stories that love in a family is so necessary and is really beautiful  and can counteract all of the negativity and nastiness that can manifest itself especially on the subject of ""being Gay""

This hour and a half 2007 documentary on one disc with post film extras is very well directed and moves along at a good pace.

3263588,5,B000YHQNCI,"I truly believe that ""God"" is a creation of man, for no other purpose than to strike fear into humanity. By the same token, organized religion is born of this fear and assures that people stay in line, do what they are told, and are charged sums of money for the purpose of lining the pockets of the clergy. Organized religion, by its nature, hates dissent, and will do anything to destroy it. This movie confirms that organized religion, and whatever holy books they use to promote their evil, are the most destructive forces on Earth. So what happens when people question what their religion has taught them about homosexuality? Other organized religions attack them, just as they have for centuries; they seek to demonize them, legislate against them, and even kill them. Yes, folks, this is the true face of religion. It is given credence by the simple-minded notion that there is someone who lives in the sky and watches everything we do. That not only appeals to humanity's bizarre fascination with super heros with magical powers, but it always plays to humanity's fear of death. One can live forever in paradise if they follow the right religion. Well, isn't that the greatest con job of all time! While this important movie makes a profound case for a new way of looking at homosexuality through the lens of religion, all it proves to me is that organized religion will drive humanity to the breaking point and destruction. I guess it will take an apocalypse of Biblical proportions before humanity grows up and chooses Reason as the guide in life, rather be preyed upon by superstition.",1294012800,5,1596,4.786231884057971

3263590,5,B000YHQNCI,"OK, maybe a little one-sided, but there's certainly a lot to be said about the brain-washing of the church-going society at large. Religion (or a form of it) has been responsible for most of the wars of the world, as well as some of the more abhorrant incidents in history (Inquisition, Holocaust, etc.) The Christian Right is hateful and mean-spirited; kids spew venom against gays that could've only been learned in the church or at home. I applaud this film for making an attempt to explain that the Bible has always been misinterpreted, and our church-going populace has been taught to hate. To hear young people spew hatred is especially unsettling. A subject this huge cannot be sufficiently argued in a 2 hour film, so it's a little one-sided, pro-gay. What bothers me the most is how wrong those fundamentalists can be about Jesus' initial message: Love one another and try to get along. The Bible was written by men who thought the earth was flat. We've come a long way, baby, and it's time to realize that God gave every individual a brain, capable of thinking, to reach out and discover mysteries that we may not have pondered. Life goes on. Dick Gephardt and his daughter were a fine example of what this film tried to get across. Also, the inclusion of people of color. The suicide of the daughter whose parents simply refused to understand. (No mention of Dick Cheney and his gay daughter). Fact is, all people are different, and in so VERY many different ways. Accepting these differences is what makes life exciting; to be stuck in a rut of thought, like that Christian Right, denies one the ability to live life at its fullest.

3263591,5,B000YHQNCI,"I had the opportunity to see this film at my church as part of a new companion study that's just been released, and I want to say how much both have helped me in my understanding of this issue. The class was at my Methodist church here in Nashville, and I joined it because I confess that, despite all the controversies surrounding this issue -- gay marriage, gays in the military, etc. -- I really hadn't gone beyond a surface understanding of the scripture. Mostly, I have been upset by how much this issue has divided our church, and I haven't been sure how to feel about it.

We watched the film the first week of the class. More than anything, I think it took me beyond the word ""issue"" and really opened my eyes to the human suffering that has been caused by our Christian tradition. I have no doubt that certain Christian practices are in place with the intent of upholding the Word of God. But how can God not be compassionate amid the pain endured by the families in this film?

God calls each of us to undertake a faith journey with an openness to the Holy Spirit, and the film definitely showed me the Holy Spirit was at work, particularly in the stories of Gene Robinson, the woman who lost her daughter to suicide, and the Minnesota couple with the gay son. Watching this film, I saw how these people changed their hearts not necessarily because they wanted to (after all, it's a lot easier to stick with the status quo), but because they were compelled to only after great thought and prayer and study. Literally, soul-searching.

After watching the film, I yearned for a similar experience, and I must say, in the next six weeks I found it through the study. It's called ""This I Know,"" and each of the six lessons is written by a different author. The two that really caught my attention are Brian McLaren and Marcus Borg. McLaren is big in evangelical circles and he's written several influential books. (My church did a Sunday school class series on his ""Everything Must Change."") Borg has certainly made a national name as an authority of Christ's teachings.

Each lesson is a step in a journey of both your mind and your heart. For me, the study was able to fill in some of the gaps the film left, particularly in the depth of scriptural understanding. Not to knock the film, but there's only so much you can cover in that time frame. There was a lesson by a national expert on the Apostle Paul, who did a great job of introducing me to the context of his writings. I also came to understand why the beliefs about sin and homosexuality have been kept going through the centuries. The lesson that most blew me away was written by a devout Mennonite who made a complete turn-around in her beliefs. The last chapter, which is Borg's, is all about putting Christ at the center of our understanding. Our class did include a couple members who are gay, and being face to face with their pain and faith struggle also really made an impact on me.

You can find the study at its own website (search for ""This I Know study""). I highly recommend both together, especially if your church is looking for a ""safe"" way to get into the topic. While the film and the study both have a certain perspective, they present it with the authority to back it up. In other words, I never felt belittled or beaten over the head -- as I would by the ""death to fags"" protesters in the film! I came away from the whole experience feeling like I truly took my own journey and came to my own conclusions, and I'm now trying to get more Sunday school classes at my church to offer it. This is what we need to make our peace with this issue once and for all.",1285372800,6,3644,4.400593471810089
3263592,5,B000YHQNCI,"This DVD succinctly points out that those who take the Bible as the absolute word of God are largely responsible for the fear and hatred of homosexuals. They interpret the Bible literally, refusing to understand or even acknowledge that it was written by man, for man, and that if they take the passages regarding homosexuality literally they are being hypocritical -- would they stone their daughter to death if she was not a virgin before marriage or would they sell her into slavery, for instance? -- two things that the Bible instructs them to do. In other words, these literalists pick out what they agree with and ignore that which they do not agree with. If they love God so much that they want to follow what they interpret as His absolute word then whatever happened to love thy neighbor as thyself? Don't they understand that God made man and that God would never have made an entire group of people and put them on this earth for the sole purpose of being targets for discrimination and hatred?

3263595,1,B000YHQNCI,"I was disappointed with this documentary.

I was expecting actual facts from the Bible regarding homosexuality, but there were few and none that concretely proved a point.  It was a movie that was moving, but only on an emotional level, hardly on a Biblical one.

After watching this I was encouraged to go directly to Leviticus and read about homosexuality in concert with eating shell-fish and selling daughters into slavery, etc...but found that Lev. 18 deals specifically with all types of SEXUAL sins.  It said nothing about cultural traditions, well, unless you consider sex with siblings, in-laws, or animals cultural traditions.  As a matter of fact Lev. 18:22 is just one verse in the middle of Several verses providing instruction for who NOT to do in bed.

The movie seemed to cloud the actual context of the Bible verses it referred to and I can understand why those who don't refer DIRECTLY to the source (the Bible) would be led to believe that God would accept those actions because of His unconditional love.

When I read about Jesus it seems to me that He was always telling people to CHANGE their behaviors after His grace was extended to them.  Go and sin no more. That's the wonder of Jesus' love and salvation.  It fills us with the power and ability to leave our sinful nature and habits to follow Him.

I appreciated the personal stories in this movie and am encouraged to show homosexuals the true love of Christ.

As I read the Bible for myself and see how Jesus came to save us from our sins, I am still not convinced that God accepts homosexuals as they are no more than He can accept a liar or thief the way they are.

Overall I was disappointed that this movie showed a bias towards acceptance of a behavior rather than a truthful and accurate accounting of Biblical instruction.",1277596800,48,1808,4.650943396226415

3263602,5,B000YHQNCI,"Who would have thought that the consecration of a bishop in New Hampshire of all places would send a fissure though the global church - not just the Anglican Church, but the church as a whole. But the consecration of an openly gay man has done just that, laying bare the divisions over sexuality that permeates the Christian Community. The Rt. Rev. Gene Robinson, Bishop of New Hampshire has become the symbol of our unease with our sexuality and its place in the church.

The film begins with Anita Bryant, back in the 1970s denouncing the ""gay agenda."" Interspersed through the film are angry denouncements of homosexuality on the part of Christians, like Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Dobson, and the ubiquitous folk from Topeka's Westborough Baptist Church.

But that is not the essence of the film. Instead it is the stories of real families who struggle with their children's sexual identity and their own religious formation. Five families are interviewed - including the family of Bishop Robinson, whose own spiritual foundations are not Episcopal, but Disciples of Christ. His parents still members of the same Kentucky Disciple church that he grew up in share their pride in their son and the journey they took to embrace him as he is, despite their earlier formation. Another famous family is that of former Congressman Richard Gephardt, whose daughter Chrissie is a lesbian. Some of the stories, like those of the Gephardts and the Robinsons are happy, but not all are. Mary Lou Wallner tells the story of her estrangement from her lesbian daughter Anna, largely on the basis of her faith formation and understanding of the Bible - an understanding she got largely from Focus on the Family. That story ends tragically in the suicide death of her daughter. But out of that tragedy came hope, for Mary Lou began to study and found that her previous understandings had been wrong. Now she speaks out on behalf of the gay and lesbian community. There is another family that is conflicted - they love their daughter and welcome her, but they can't accept who she is. That's a work in progress. Finally there's the story of Jake Reitan, a young gay man who grew up in a solid - Lutheran - Christian family. It took time for his family to embrace him as he is, but in the long run they became advocates, standing with him as Soul Force demonstrated at the Focus on the Family headquarters.

The powerful statement these stories make is that this is a personal issue. Whatever your views of homosexuality or of the Bible, things change when it affects your family. How you read the Bible is influenced by your own experiences. That is true of me - I'm a graduate of a leading evangelical seminary, whose president is featured in the film (unfortunately affirming traditional interpretations of these texts that excluded), but when my brother came out, things changed. Our hang up is with sex, but when we realize that this is my brother, or my sister, or my son or my daughter, what do we do? Dick Gephardt says it well - when Chrissie came out, fearing that she might be disowned, he declared a parent's unconditional love. Love won out. As Mel White put it: ""Once they realize who we are up close and personal that fear goes away.""

The film deals with the families, but it also deals with the texts. A series of speakers, ranging from Mel White, Peter Gomes, Desmond Tutu to Rabbi Stephen Greenberg, Disciples pastors Larry Keene and Steve Kindle, and an American Baptist woman pastor Sandra Sparks. Each of these speakers takes on our cultural presuppositions, formed by our faith traditions, and the Biblical texts - of which there are only about six, few of which even apply today in any real way. We hear that Leviticus declares a man lying with a man to be an abomination, but then it also says the same about eating shrimp. As Larry Keene, a Disciple pastor and former Pepperdine professor points out, the question isn't so much what the Bible seems to say, but how we read it and use it today.

At the heart of the debate is the question of choice - is it a choice or not? The film takes on this question creatively, through the use of a brief, at times humorous, but pointed cartoon. This piece sits in the middle of the film, providing both comic relief and movement forward on the discussion. And as most reputable science states, this isn't a choice, it is one's identity. If so, then we must ask: what next for our society?

We live at a time when the vast numbers of people are biblically illiterate and read the Bible in bits and pieces, influenced largely by their own upbringing. This reading is combined with great amounts of fear. It is true that our society's greatest fear is of male homosexuals - a fear of a feminization of a man. To be gay is to be - in the eyes of many - feminine. Gay men, such as White and Robinson, make it clear that this isn't true. But the fear is still there, and it's a fear we must address. Our fear leads us to plead with gays and lesbians to stay in the closet, but as Mel White points out, the ""closet is a place of death."" Young gays, feeling suppressed and forced into a closet, with no one to talk with, too often and very tragically, take their own lives. And why? Because our society is permeated by fear of the other and formed by outmoded interpretations of the Bible.

Is this film biased? Of course it is. It is a strongly stated, but not in your face, statement of the dignity and equality and the humanity of our gay and lesbian friends, neighbors, and family members. It is a film that must be seen. At this point it is in fairly restricted distribution, but hopefully this will change - for the church must change so that the world might change.

If the film begins (with the exception of the Anita Bryant outburst) with an introduction of the Robinson family, it appropriately ends with his joyous and yes controversial consecration as Bishop of New Hampshire. The world will never be the same - and that's a good thing.",1258329600,7,5984,4.585981308411215
3263603,3,B000YHQNCI,"I viewed this film recently to see what, if anything, it could contribute to an understanding the classical Jewish and Christian understandings about homosexuality. Its Biblical hermeneutics were no more than retreads of the hackneyed ""higher criticism"" school along with very weak and tenuous suppositions about what St. Paul ""really meant"" in Romans etc.

But messy and ultimately ""irrelevant"" details of Biblical scholarship and Christian teaching aside (for ultimately these are not the core issues for the film-makers) I have given this film a THREE-STAR rating for being very well-made propaganda meant to give emotional satisfaction and affirmation for those already opposing the traditional western religious perspectives on homosexuality. In this respect the film is similar to Bill Maher's ""Religulous"" or Ben Stein's ""Expelled"" - if you are already one of Maher's fellow atheists or Stein's fellow ""intelligent design"" advocates you will find the respective films reaffirming, entertaining, and full of ridicule of the opposing positions. Perhaps all three films belong to some special genre of ""Preaching to the Choir"" films which need some special designation or category to distinguish them from more serious documentaries. However for those who are already sympathetic to the film's thesis this will be a very enjoyable, self-affirming way to pass 96 minutes of your time.

If you are one of those, like the several families shown in this film, who really do find the current teachings of your home denomination regarding homosexuality to be ""hateful"" or ""harmful"" there is a simple solution:  Quit your current denomination and join one of the several denominations, such as the Episcopal Church of the United States, or the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, whose teaching on faith and morals are more to your liking. You do have ""freedom of association"" under the First Amendment after all.",1257897600,7,1914,5.416107382550336

3263609,1,B000YHQNCI,"'For The Bible Tells Me So' is seriously biased and intellectually deceiving when it comes to examining what the whole Bible actually says about homosexuality. Instead of presenting a serious argument for homosexuality from within the text, the documentary plays on emotions and commits several logical fallacies of relevance (personal attacks, appeals to consequences, etc.).

First of all, the story of the couple whose daughter committed suicide rightly deserves compassion. However, suicide does not make homosexuality right or wrong. Many people and teenagers in particular commit suicide, unfortunately. And the reasons for suicide are numerous: bankruptcy, emotional pain, loneliness, murder, etc. While we have compassion for the persons, their suicide neither validates nor invalidates their actions; it is irrelevant in that regard. This is only one example of the many instances of the documentary playing on emotion rather than presenting a rigorous argument to win the audience's opinion.

Second, while the Scriptures deal with homosexuality in several texts, the focus of what ""the Bible so tells me"" seems to be on Leviticus 18. Leviticus 18 deals first with incest of any kind, then adultery, then human (children) sacrifice to idols, then homosexuality, then bestiality. Oddly enough, this documentary does not say anything about any of that, except homosexuality. What about incest, adultery, and sacrificing children on altars to idols, for instance?  Any biblically literate person knows that the chapter subdivisions were later added to the text. So a look at Leviticus 19 in the same context shows: prohibition of idolatry, stealing, fraud, lying, robbery, injustice in judgment, hatred, vengeance, occultism, and prostitution; commandment of administering justice, loving the neighbor, welcoming the stranger, honoring the elderly, etc. The documentary mentions none of those things but does point at Leviticus 19:27 where neither the sides of the head nor the edges of one's beard were to be shaved, and hastily concludes the whole text is irrelevant to contemporary reality.
Here is the evidence of intellectual dishonesty and grossly misleading hermeneutics: while the producers took the time to show the ""context"" of Sodom & Gomorrah and of Romans 1, as they claimed, to discredit any claim opposing their view, they did none of this for the Leviticus passage. For example, a look at history shows the shaving and trimming of hair and beard in particular ways as ritual practices in honor of particular pagan deities (Orotal for example). The prohibition of that practice was thus congruent with that of other idolatrous practices, such as the sacrifice of children or body cuts.

Third, the treatment of Romans 1 is astoundingly dishonest. The claim that ""unnatural"" does not mean ""immoral"" and is only culturally-conditioned (Jews vs. Romans) does not stand a close-reading of the passage, which shows the use in the same context as ""unnatural"" of the following terms: ""lust, dishonor their bodies, vile passions, shameful, penalty, error, debased mind, things not fitting, unrighteousness.""  Moreover, homosexuality is not singled out, but mentioned alongside ""wickedness, greed, malice, envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness, backbiting, hatred of God, violence, pride, boasting, invention of evil things, disobedience to parents, undiscernment, untrustworthiness, lack of love, unforgiveness, lack of mercy"", in a way similar to 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. The attempts to dispute the meaning of the greek text or to restrict the prohibition to a strictly Jewish audience or to justify ""monogamous long-term homosexual relationships"" seriously disregards both the literal and cultural context of both texts, which were written to two different cultural audiences, Romans and Corinthians.

Fourth, the claim that the problem of Sodom & Gomorrah in Genesis 19 was inhospitality rather than sexual immorality and homosexuality does not stand 2 Peter 2:6-8 and Jude 7 and seems a too hasty attempt to evade the all-too clear reality exposed in those passages.

Fifth, the claim that Jesus never said anything about homosexuality is akin to saying he never said anything about incest or bestiality or the sacrificing of children to idols and thus approves of them. That is a fallacy of relevance. More to the point, however, Jesus does speak about relationship and marriage: ""Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. (Matthew 19:4-6)"". So, Jesus did say the Creator made humans male and female. And Jesus did not even envision the possibility of a marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman to address it, but a MAN leaving his FATHER AND MOTHER, and clinging unto his WIFE. And when confronting adultery, he says the one who ""looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with HER in HIS heart (Matthew 5:27-28)."" It couldn't be clearer. You can't miss that. In this sense, Jesus did say everything about homosexuality.

Sixth, putting food regulations in the Bible on par with what the Bible says about sexuality disregards what Jesus said about food in Matthew 15 and Mark 7, namely: ""There is nothing that enters a man from outside which can defile him. It is what comes out of a man that defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within and defile a man."" Moreover, the early church dealt with this problem and resolved it at the Jerusalem Council as described in Acts 15, concluding that there was to be ""no greater burden than these necessary things: abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality."" In other words, food regulations do not hold for Jesus and the Church. They were ""a shadow of the things to come"" (Colossians 2:16-17).

Lastly, one often-heard claim that was implied in this documentary is that Paul was not inspired to write those words, that they cannot be considered scripture and therefore do not stand. Along that line of thought (which is an appeal to authority to discredit a statement), it is interesting to read Peter, arguably the most authoritative apostle after Jesus, commending Paul and his writings in 2 Peter 3: ""our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, as also in all his epistles, speaking in them these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do the rest of the Scriptures."" So Peter respected Paul and had the humility to admit learning from him. Moreover, Paul gave up his life for the sake of preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles without the requirements of the law regarding washings, food regulations, circumcision, etc., against the Judaizers who sought to kill him for exactly that. Paul was the first to defend the freedom of the Spirit in Christ, and the other apostles agreed with him as narrated in Acts 15.

In conclusion, ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" fails to present an argument for homosexuality from the Bible and rather revels in misinformation, twisting of the truth, arguments ad hominem, irrelevant appeals, and psychological devices to win the naive watcher. It would have been better to make an argument from outside the Bible. The bits of pseudo-science such as animals being homosexual were very disturbing and, at best, sarcastically laughable. It is true that the Christian response to homosexuality should be one of love and respectful engagement. However, presenting Gene Robinson as a ""holy man"" after he divorced his wife -- who did not commit adultery -- to live with a male lover is really a joke, in regard of all Christian teaching. He is unrepentant and disqualified for leadership in the Church (1 Timothy 3, Titus 1). He was also admitted in rehab in 2006 for alcoholism. There is still hope for him, if he repents. Jesus died on the Cross so that no one else has to die. He rose so that everyone can live. He offers abundant life and freedom from sin. God loves everyone, and He loves us too much to leave us broken: He restores, if we would let Him. The choice is ours.  Sin deceives us, tortures us, and kills us. It is not homophobic to say that homosexuality is sinful, just as it is not ""adulterophobic"" to say that adultery is sinful, or ""liarphobic"" to say that lying is sinful. Exert some more critical thinking. Love and peace.",1249689600,88,8844,5.113494809688581
3263610,3,B000YHQNCI,"I gave this ""propagandamentary"" three stars because it was competantly edited and at least had a soundtrack, and did not go out of it's way using obvious propaganda techniques, like weird music or grainy video, to make the ""wrong"" people (in this case those fundamentalist Christians) look bad.

But beyond that it was just as I predicted.  I got to see...

The completely predictable Christians arguing out of the book of Leviticus against homosexuality, seeming oblivious to the fact that neither Christians nor the secular world are bound by the Law of Moses.

The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones pointing out that since Leviticus contains laws against eating foods that we know we can eat, and about mixing different kinds of cloth, that therefore the Levitical laws against homosexuality are invalid for us too.

The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones invalidating Paul's obvious prohibition against homosexuality in Romans 1 (but I didn't predict that the reason given was that Paul simply could not envision long term monogamous homosexual relationships).  But Paul is rather obvious in his meaning in 1 cor 6:9 too.

The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones making it seem as though Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for their ""inhospitality"" rather than their sexual issues.  The ""enlightened"" ones missed, however, that Sodom and Gomorrah are mentioned many times later in scripture, not the least by Jude 1:7 in the New Testament as examples of those who give themselves up to sexual immorality.  So apparently Jude was unaware that the problem was really ""inhospitality"".

Then there's the predictable Christian parents who have children who turn out to be homosexual; the discrediting of the Christain programs that claim to convert homosexuals back to heterosexuals; and of course, the footage of the young redneckish teen male who loves to beat up homosexuals, as though this represents Christianity of any flavor.  I'll stop there; wouldn't want to give away the ending.

So what is worse, the Christians who waste their time trying to contain or control homosexuality through political means, or the ""enlightened"" ones who convince the biblically illiterate that there's nothing in the bible that condemns homosexuality?  Beats me.

3263616,5,B000YHQNCI,"This DVD of ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" was recommended to me by one of my online friends with whom I'd discussed my Christian faith after being raised in a Jewish household.  The irony is, the recommender is a Jew, himself.  He said this documentary placed great emphasis on the church's negative stance on homosexuality.  I discovered quickly that the DVD was available in the library system of Indianapolis and reserved it immediately.  It took a couple of months to get here, but it was worth the wait.

The interviews with figures such as Dr. Mel White, Bishop V. Gene Robinson, Jacob Reitan, his parents, Peter J. Gomes and all the others were enlightening and touching.  And, the archive footage of the opposition was properly childish and angering.  In college, I ran with the sort of people that openly judged gays and lesbians unfairly.  After graduation, I came to realize how mistaken they were.  After watching this disc, I immediately decided to someday purchase a copy of it.  In time, I bought it for both me and one of my dear friends.

The most climactic part of the film for me was a segment near the end.  The Reitan family had ventured to the Focus on the Family headquarters in Colorado Springs to present Dr. Jim Dobson with love propaganda. They were turned away without a word, the property was carted off, the shades pulled down and the authorities called in to prevent entrance.  It was pathetic the way the Reitans were arrested, because Dr. Dobson had put his fingers in his ears to block out what turned out just to be love propaganda.

When I watched that segment for the first time, I was so enraged I nearly broke up one of my guitars.  But, what would that have achieved?  The anger would still be there, I'd have one less instrument to use for positive purposes, and Dr. Dobson would still be what I call ""a pseudo-theologian with a pseudo-reputation, spouting pseudo-spiritual lessons about a whole lot of nothing.  And, the only genuine article he's got is his silver hair.""  (Sorry, that's paraphrasing a line from an episode of the sitcom, A Different World.)  The man evidently suffers from a blind, ignorant stubbornness I call ""Brick Wall Syndrome.""  And, the arrest of the Reitans is a clear re-creation of the incident of Sodom when the angels were assaulted by the residents.  But, he is a human being, and there's always divine hope for any human.

The Lord doesn't hate gays or lesbians anymore than he hates blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, believers in Shinto, Universalist Unitarians, non-believers - or anybody.  He doesn't hate the United States of America.  And, He doesn't hate the Episcopal Church.  He couldn't possibly see the use of apartheid, the degradation of women, revoking their right to choose or insulting other peoples' creeds, either.

3263617,2,B000YHQNCI,"The problem with this film is that it doesn't provide a balanced view of the issue and portrays conservative Christians as full of hate and a danger to society.

this film is attempting to promote an agenda.

1)first, gay activists came out of the closet and began to demand their rights in society, work place etc  2)the next step  They are demanding that conservatives (especially those with traditional values) recognize those rights in Churches Private groups (boy scouts, etc) and compromise thier moral values...  The final goal is to make anyone speaking out against the homesexual lifestyle guilty of Discrimination and therefore subject to Civil fines ... this will eventually change from Civil Discrimination to a Criminal offense (hate speech or hate crime legislation) with those speaking out subject to Arrest or Court ordered Re-education training (Diversity /Sensitivity training etc)

to give some real life examples:

in New Mexico, Elaine Photography was found guilty of discrimination for refusing to shoot the commitment ceremony of a lesbian couple; in California a Christian doctor was found guilty of refusing to offer medical services to a lesbian woman who wanted to be artificially inseminated in order to have a baby with her partner; in Massachusetts, elementary school parents were told they did not have the right to keep their children home when homosexual issues were being discussed in class, since same-sex marriage is legal there (not to mention the fact that the courts found it more important to teach children ""diversity"" than to honor the wishes of the parents).

In England, an Anglican Vicar was fined and ordered to undergo equal opportunities training for refusing to hire a gay youth leader; a graduate student in the counseling program at Eastern Michigan University was expelled for refusing to affirm homosexual behavior in a private counseling session; and a Christian pastor in Canada was forbidden from speaking or writing or publishing anything that is critical of homosexual practice after writing a letter to the editor in a local newspaper. in Sweden religous leaders will lose thier license to preach if they state that homosexuality is a sin or immoral lifestyle

is homosexuality a behavour or is a person ""born that way?""

the movie attempts to prove that homosexuality is not a behavour choice but rather the way a person is born and gives some case studies. (the more boys a woman has the greater likelyhood of one being Gay due to her antibodies attacking a male fetus.. if a woman has twins one is Gay their is a 70% chance the 2nd twin will also be gay etc)

let's assume Gay's are ""born this way"".. it doesn't matter.. the U.S. Dept of Health (HHS.GOV) states that around 3% of the population is Gay. Clearly not the majority, male/female relations are required to continue the human race without the use of modern medicine.  so we are talking about an abnormality... similar to Down Syndrome, mental retardation etc people with these conditions shouldn't be hated, but helped to deal with thier disablity. either by counseling to understand why your having these feelings, or helping to live in mainstream society.

what should a traditional Christians do?

to be VERY Clear: we are not endorsing Violance against anyone. we are speaking out against Behavour  This is NOT a Civil Rights issue, (not based on the color of your skin, your physical gender M/F - You can't tell a person is Gay just by looking at them)it is one of Behavour & Actions. Catholic Priests choose to practice Abstinence to increase thier spirituality  According to the Bible Unmarried singles, Homosexuals shouldn't be engaging in sexual activity.. it doesn't matter what your feeling are or the thoughts in your head... a 16yr old boy wants to makeout with his Prom date.. it feels right to him ...it's still wrong.. (see provb 14:12) reading pornography, masterbation is also commdemmned (Matt 5:27-28)

What is a Bible Marriage?

The Bible defines Marriage initially as Adam & Eve (one man & one women) NOT Adam & Steve... or Eve & Kristy.. the Old testiment does have cases where One man was married to several Women.. (personally I think any Guy agreeing to this is crazy)

But I thought God loves everyone? can a Gay person be Christian?

absolutely true.. God Loves everyone, it is our behavour & actions.. perhaps your purpose in life isn't to be married or have a family, you could have a higher calling in fact people that overcome Same gender attraction or great temptations in thier life recieve Special blessing from God (see James 1:12-16) sex isn't required to express love.. countless examples of this exist.",1242000000,13,4663,4.992258064516129

3263621,1,B000YHQNCI,"Several people have commented on this film as being ""bridge-building"" etc. I would say that this film is likely to make great strides in healing the rifts between gay activists and the Christian right... in much the same way that racial slurs heal tensions between ethnic groups. I am not Evangelical, but I could think of no better words to describe the portrayal of Evangelicals in this film than ""insensitive and hateful."" It was obvious that many hours of footage were taken, and then culled, Michael Moore-style, to select those bits that most make Evangelicals look ignorant and ridiculous. As a piece of ""preaching to the choir"" propaganda, it has obviously struck a chord, but this is a film for making homosexuals and heterodox Christians feel better about themselves. Please do not make the mistake of thinking that it clarifies any important subject, or that it would strike an orthodox Christian as anything but crude and offensive.

The claims to Biblical ""scholarship"" are nothing short of absurd. The Old Testament passages are treated in a very kindergarten way, glazing over the complex relationship between the Old Law and the New as though it were insignificant, when in fact that is critical to any evaluation of the moral teachings found in the Old Testament. Much, much worse though was the treatment of St. Paul's writings, which was so ludicrous that they evidently couldn't find a single scholar to speak for it, though they obviously had interviewed some of the most heterodox, liberal Biblical scholars available. The briefest examination of the Greek text, or even just a reading of the full passage in translation, should make it painfully obvious that St. Paul was indeed condemning homosexuality as sinful, not merely unusual. And the other two Pauline passages dealing with homosexuality are simply not addressed. A *very* charitable interpretation might have the filmmakers merely deeply confused on this point, though really, it seems much more likely that they are simply dishonest.

But this brings me back to my main point. What, really, is the point of this charade? St. Paul clearly condemned homosexuality; only the wildest delusions could bring one to believe otherwise. But surely the people who made this film, and most of the ones who liked it, are not the sort to lose sleep over something like that. One can hardly imagine that *they* have any strong commitment to Biblical inerrancy! So why can't they just content themselves with the usual, ""St. Paul had some fine moral teachings, but unfortunately also adopted some prejudices common to his day blah blah blah"" and leave it at that?

The answer: this film isn't just about affirming homosexuals. It's about making them feel good at the expense of orthodox Christians. It's no fun to think that Christians might actually have some legitimate concerns about sexual morality, or a perspective worth taking seriously. Much better to portray them as hypocritical idiots who don't even know their own holy book! And of course, in making these childish jibes, the film is disrespecting one of the very things that is most sacred to serious Christians.

In short, this film is hateful, offensive and deeply dishonest.",1236816000,36,3209,5.071969696969697
3263622,4,B000YHQNCI,"For the Bible Tells Me So is a documentary that provides an overview of the debate regarding homosexuality and how it is not approved within the pages of the bible.  Sure, religion has been used as an excuse to segregate, murder, and enslave whole groups of people for centuries but at least up until the last one hundred years or so; those Christian knew their bible verses quite well.  They honored their rigid canon and seemed to know their own propaganda a bit more than today's multitude of illiterate bible thumpers and religious politicians.  I always wondered why the nice Christians out there weren't a little bit more upset over this.

Anyway, For the Bible Tells Me So makes a very keen observation; politicizing the bible for anti-gay purposes can be equated to politicizing the bible for those of us who are troubled by other abominations.  The film sites other abominations in Leviticus that can probably be equated to homosexuality and some of them are ridiculous.  Unfortunately most of the sheep in this culture probably only associate the term abomination with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incredible-Hulk/dp/B001DHXT1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incredible Hulk</a>'s arch-nemesis.  So really, almost anything can be denounced by the bible for political purposes.  Now, as a human being, my knee jerk reaction to the fact that the bible indicates we should execute homosexuals isn't whether or not we should follow the word of god here but instead, whether or not we should consider some elements of the bible not only obsolete but offensive to the peace of humanity, so take that for what it is.  I really appreciated the film's interviews with bible scholars who do find massive value in the book everyday but do not agree with the ideas this film attacks regarding homosexuality.  For the Bible Tells Me So does not fiercely attack religion per se, and for that it gains even more credibility in my eyes. Instead, the movie pushes an agenda of its own and asks that Christianity actually accept homosexuality by demonstrating the few denominations that already have, among other points.  At least that is kind of what I got out of it.  It is a fascinating topic and it turns out to be a really fascinating perspective, but overall, the way the bible is politicized is unfair to both homosexuals and to many Christians.

There are some really powerful stories about real people here and I think that is why I found this film so compelling.  I don't like to let my opinion slip out too often, especially when we are just talking about a movie here, but I am absolutely convinced that homosexuality is not a choice.  Let's assume that's true for a minute and consider the suicide rate of homosexuals.  I'm convinced something is wrong here and films like this might help us work toward understanding each other more.  It is not a flawless message but For the Bible Tells Me So does have some hugely important things to say.",1233878400,9,2992,5.012121212121212

3263626,5,B000YHQNCI,"""For the Bible Tells Me So"" (FBTMS) by director Daniel Karslake is an interesting movie on many levels.  Most superficially, it is a documentary illustrating how many religious leaders have held aloft homosexuality as a convenient demon through which to influence their flock.  Through candid interviews with several individuals and their parents, the movie follows the personal evolution of families that are coming to gripes with the realization that their child is not straight.  More fascinating is that three of these families contain parents and/or children who are practicing pastors or ministers.

Gene Robinson ignited waves of controversy, discussion, and hatred when he was elected as a bishop in the Anglican Church in 2004.  The issue was that Bishop Gene Robinson was an openly gay, non-celibate priest.  In several interviews with him and his parents, we have a glimpse into the spiritual torture of a man who suffers inner torment as he confronts his failed marriage, his parents, and finally his faith after he accepts who he is.  We are able to share in his ultimate vindication towards the end of the film as he is ushered in as bishop, not to cries of rage, but to cheers of joy.

Chrissy Gephardt, daughter of yesteryear's presidential hopeful Richard Gephardt, brings the viewer along during her struggle with sexuality.  Chrissy also encounters anguish within a loving, but passionless, marriage.  Ultimately, she informs her parents that she is gay--far from rejecting her, they embrace their daughter and offer her a place on the presidential-election campaign staff.  In her own words, she felt acceptance beyond anything she had expected during the campaign.

Delving deeper into the movie, the viewer is presented arguments which attack two of the fundamentalist's core messages:  that homosexuality is explicitly stated as evil in the Bible, and that the Sodom and Gomorrah stories were primarily about homosexuality and ""perversion.""  Critics attest that the rule found in Leviticus that demands capital punishment for those who are homosexual has to be examined contextually, instead of literally.  They go on to argue that many other rules in Leviticus also threaten death for a variety of other rather mundane activities, such as eating shrimp or working on the Sabbath.  Biblical scholars from both sides also debate the current belief in academia that Sodom and Gomorrah were actually destroyed over differences in tribal custom--one being the tradition of inviting strangers into the home, of all things.

It is a familiar argument to anyone having difficulties parsing the inherent contradiction in interpreting the Bible literally--you must literally believe everything in the Bible to truly be a literalist.  So why, one may ask, is the Bible being waved around as ""proof"" that homosexuality is evil if it is clear that you cannot base modern behavior on millennia-old dictates?  This film suggests that those who use the Bible in this manner are not intellectually honest, or honorable, folk.

FBTMS challenges viewers to answer three questions:  why do you believe, what do you believe, and how did you come to your belief regarding homosexuality?  Through interviews and personal stories, the story told is that homophobia is exactly that:  ""the state of fearing that which is homosexual.""  The filmmakers suggest that this fear is lent religious credence with a few scattered Biblical quotations mixed with earnest sermons from influential ministers.  This is a stunning argument when examined--are religious leaders really just wrapping up a primitive fear in the coating of malleable religious dogma?

Other issues explored are the choice/no-choice controversy, ""homosexual rehabilitation,"" and hate crimes.  This movie delivers its message in a scholarly, passionate, subtle, and sublime fashion.  The message is simple.  Love--of parents, of neighbors, of community, and of tolerance--is the answer.  Daniel Karslake directs this masterfully, as too-often an ""informative"" film can quickly deteriorate into preachy, irritating material that is off-message.  This documentary is highly recommended to everyone, especially those willing to see a movie that avoids annoying methods of argumentation while still delivering a powerful message of tolerance.",1227312000,3,4298,5.447129909365559

3263631,5,B000YHQNCI,"The feature length documentary, For the Bible Tells Me So, takes a journey into the lives of five Christian families who raised gay or lesbian children. Two of the five families are prominent families in the US: former Presidential candidate Dick Gephardt and his family and the first openly gay Episcopal bishop Gene Robinson and his family. The documentary follows each family as they begin to process their child's sexual orientation, with each family responding in a variety of ways, from complete acceptance to loving tolerance to rejection and judgment.
 In the end, For the Bible Tells Me So is unambiguously pro-gay in its approach to the topic. A large majority of the scholars who provide interpretations of the six or seven biblical passages concerning homosexuality conclude that monogamous homosexual relationships can be supported by the church without betraying biblical honesty. While their arguments are compelling, perhaps the most compelling aspect of this film is the love and compassion these families show for one another in stark opposition to the hatred and vengeance the Church shows toward homosexuals. This message is not only a powerful reminder for the Church but a call to true Christ-like compassion that has been lacking in this area.
 The only weakness of this film is the lack of healthy dialog between the liberal and conservative approaches to the topic. It is clear the film makers want to begin the dialog between homosexuals and the church, yet the film is probably too polarizing for this to take place. For most viewers of the film, it will be either a celebrated commentary on the validity of homosexuality or, to borrow a term used often in the film, a pure abomination.",1224460800,4,1713,5.049469964664311

The high-energy hate of the film followed by the calm (though no less passioned) talk that Gene gave was an interesting juxtaposition.  Of course, the movie is about Gene Robinson's life and consecration as Bishop of New Hampshire (in the Episcopal Church).  But it is much more than that.  It is about the struggle of homosexuals, and also of those who love and care about them, while not understanding nor accepting their orientation.  It specifically presents the rhetoric of the religious right, and and how their scriptural logic is flawed.  Also, while the movie focuses on bigotry against homosexuals, you can't help but recognize that this is the same hatefulness that has worked hard to keep Blacks and other minorities subjugated.  We see the same thing at work today against Mexicans and others.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to hear the 'other side of the story'.  The anguish of the parents in the movie is palpable; it really shows the humaness of everyone who has to deal with this issue day-in and day-out.

3263638,5,B000YHQNCI,"This powerful and courageous video exposes the Fundamental Christian Right and other traditional organized religious venues for what they really are, as well as de-bunking their twisted logic, in an objective, academic and empiracal fashion, relative to the alleged ""Words of God"", via the Scriptures.

The credible, thoughtful and realistic interpretations of the Biblical lines that the hateful/Old Testament autocrats use to freely admonish the ideologies associated with same-sex relationships, are skillfully presented in a creative and culturally time-sensitive fashion that is holistic, insightful and transcends the anal and restrictive mindsets associated with ""Old Time Religion"", thus guiding Compassionate and ""Christ-like"" minded human beings into the 21st century.

Families that have experienced the heartache, pain, suffering and social sitigmatization that comes from the hateful rhetoric and shamful osterization energies that spew from those that ""judge & condem"" others who condone same-sex relationships, share their first-hand immersion experiences in a frank and forthright way.  The powerful testimonials are gut-wrenching, profound, and at times, brought tears to my eyes as I empathized with them, being a parent and loving father.

Watching the families deal with their crisis and finding the courage and strength to arrive at the Christ-centered conclusion that, regardless of the torment that may have occured because of their child's ""choices"", thier child is ALWAYS their child and worthy of their UNCONDITIONAL LOVE!

It was refreshing to share the family's experiences, as they embraced life with zest and zeal, as they were willing to grow spiritually, accepting and loving their offspring, as being one of God's children, in spite of their gender specific choices.  It took real courage and genuine parental love for the families involved, to whom traditional relationships were the norm, to reaffirm and validate the passion  that emanates from the love of one's child, as only a mother and father can know.  Kudos to those wonderful parents!

What a travesty, actually an abomination that shames our great nation, as a few well-placed omniscient, seemingly omnipotent and self-proclaimed experts (such as Dr. James Dobson, Jimmy Swaggart and others), due to their high-visibility stations-in-life, often as alleged religious leaders, teachers, and spiritual mentors, have abused their powers.  They have perpetuated the hateful, condescendingly judgmental and negative energies, acting as official monikders for the Almighty Ineffable, who have destroyed families and fueled the rage in the less-stable ""Christo-Fascists"" that perpetrate the increasing number of horrific hate crimes that are directed towards those that engage-in and/or support-same sex relationships.

This DVD is a riveting, no-nonsense and sorely needed vehicle for positive change for all civilized and decent people who have an inherent sense of Reverence and Spirituality.  More importantly, it is also a powerful wake-up call for the so-called Traditionalists who are driven by Old Testament energies that reek with the cruel ""fire and brimstone"" payback mind-sets that one will ""go to hell"" for same-sex interests.  It may also encourage those that engage in rote and simplistic behaviors that are ""preached"" weekly in Church by the so-called Evangelicals and Ministers of organized religious venues that are often more interested in their own self-serving agendas and financial gains, as opposed to offering genuine spiritual guidance for the masses, to perhaps ""re-consider"" and reflect on thier own spiritual journey relative to Enlightment and Salvation.

Additionally, the video reminds us that the old adage that states that the greatest problem with the Church is the Chruch, is worth a second look.  Too often, the politics associated with traditional organized religious venues, spill-over into a hateful divisveness that perpetuates an ""us and them"" mentality where each venue claims to have the ONLY way to Salvation and Heaven.  Sadly, the language of the so-called Judeo Christian Bible was written in the context of a reality that existed some 2000 years ago.  As society and Culture evolved, progressed and grew with the times, too many of the ""quoted"" biblical lines have been either taken out of context or interpreted in a restrictive and unrealistic fashion that are misleading and simply dead wrong! Just as beauty is said to be in the eyes of the beholder, perhaps TURTH lies in the eyes(soul) of the beholder, as well.

In the end, I doubt that a personal God works to inform us, day to day, about how we should behave, relative to societal norms, politics and cultural constructs.  Freedeom for Americans allows for CHOICES in the domain of man-made rules, social order and in civilized living matters.  ""Because the Bible tells me so"", is quite possibly the greatest impetus for all of God's children to observe and to LIVE The Golden Rule as the best guide towards Englightenment and Salvation!

In this film families of lesbian, gay, and bisexual Christian children share their struggle with understanding God's will concerning homosexuality and also their difficulties with accepting their children. The movie is most powerful because of the honesty and vulnerability of the families. The two screenings I was at, though, were probably attended by people who are already affirming. This movie needs to be seen by parishioners in every church--affirming or not, so that people know the struggle of LGBT Christians everywhere. I truly believe this story has the power and beauty to change people's hearts.

3263641,2,B000YHQNCI,"I liked this film because it challenges one to think.  However, I think its portrayal of what the Bible says about homosexuality is very lopsided.  The argument of the film relies mainly upon emotion and opinion than what the Bible actually says.  What little it does allow the Bible to speak it does so in a very bias manner.  I would have liked to see some dialogue between the two sides presented in a balanced fashion.  Perhaps some scholarship on the original texts of Hebrew and Greek would have served well.  Overall, it challenges Christians to see that this issue is not as clear cut as they would like to believe, but its weakness is that it opens questions that are never answered, namely the title.

There have been a few criticisms that it's a bit one sided, and you know what, it's true. It's true because this is a film that's only being told by one side of the equation, so naturally, it will only be the opinions, beliefs and feelings of those who have continually felt the negative effects of bigoted Christianity in their lives. It's not the filmmakers job to be completely balanced, not every story is fair. Surely, what the men and women went through in this film wasn't fair, so to chide the film for not being completely fair to Christianity is a bit insulting to the integrity of the entire piece.

3263647,5,B000YHQNCI,"I share the sentiments of the many other positive reviewers.
I just want to mention that it's impossible to measure the damage done to gays and their families by Dobson's media empire and his perverse theology that teaches homophobia.  Not only is it harming people here in the U.S. (including the heart-breaking story of one mother of a lesbian in the movie), but Dobson's anti-gay message is global and creates suffering worldwide&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dangerous-Living-Coming-Out-in-the-Developing-World/dp/B0007TKOS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dangerous Living - Coming Out in the Developing World</a>.
I visited ""Focus on the Family"" once, and was shocked by the literature that was crafted to create fear towards gays.  It was not dissimilar to how Jews were once spoken about, or how immigrants are framed as threats to America (never mind that they pick our food, and take care of our children, and mow our lawns, etc).  Time and again, elites and their media are dividing people, in order to more easily control them.  It's a game as old as empire.  Thankfully, we have DVDs like ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" to counter the divisive preaching of people like Dobson and Rod Parsley (who recently declared that ""we get off on warfare""), and the propaganda of radio hosts like Dennis Prager and Rush Limbaugh.
Let's get this film shown in as many classrooms as possible.  If you can, buy extra copies and donate them to second-hand stores, or send some copies to U.S. troops through projects like ""Books for Soldiers.""  There are so many people, gay and straight, who would benefit from coming across this film.  We can do a lot to bring it to the attention of people who may not have ever heard of it.

3263648,5,B000YHQNCI,"""For the Bible Tells Me So"" is a wonderful documentary based on life experiences from a broad spectrum of those involved in the topic of gay/lesbian acceptance with the overwhelming dynamic of a religious background.

What impressed me the most about this film was the variety of scholars interviewed and the powerful explanations behind the historical and cultural context of the usual scriptures used by everyday persons of Judeo-Christian upbringing to discriminate and justify their prejudice toward gays and lesbians.

For anyone wanting to consider other viewpoints, or even challenge their own with regard to the topic of homosexuality and their faith, this film is a must-see.",1214179200,6,684,5.383177570093458
3263649,4,B000YHQNCI,"""For the Bible Tells Me So"" is a documentary purporting to refute those who claim the Bible condemns homosexuality.  Thought provoking and compassionate toward those who are gay and who are suffering oppression because of it, the film left me conflicted.

On the one hand, I do feel compassion for the pain that gays experience because of their orientation, compassion for the families who have lost loved ones to suicide or who have broken relationships.  On the other hand, I feel the movie demonizes the church by painting it with a ovrly broad brush that is more appropriately reserved to one fundamentalist, literalistic slice.

Put differently, it is no more accurate to see The Church as a monolithic entity than it is to put The Gays into one stereotypical bucket.  The truth is that many strands of the church are struggling - albeit unsuccessfully - with inclusion of gays and acceptance of them.  The fact that the Episcopal Church ordained a gay Bishop illustrates the progress made but also the distance left to travel.

Further, there is no denying that - in both the Old and New Testaments - the Bible has something to say about homosexuality, and that something is consistently condemnatory.  There are ""contextual"" attempts to dilute the ""abomination"" label or to explain away the condemnation.  Whether you find these explanations compelling may depend on what side of the divide you stand on.  Further, the efforts at being confrontational and demonizing the likes of James Dobson risks putting gays into the same oppression mode as their purported fundamentalist enemies.  In such a way, the gay movement threatens to become a mirror image of that which it purports to hate.

Again, this is a thought-provoking documentary with a clear point of view ion the issue.  It hopefully can lead to constructive - not confrontational - dialogue between Christians and gays, not as mutually exclusive factions but as overlapping groups.",1214006400,5,1947,5.046875
3263650,3,B000YHQNCI,"Many people may be confused with the definition of sin and the Bible's opinion.  This film makes certain points some of them accurate most of them built on flawed theology.  It completely ignores the center argument which is that homosexuality was dangerous in the Old Testament so therefore God attacked it possibly to limit disease.  Now in modern times God still disagrees with homosexuality but he no longer needs people to attack them.  I found it ludacris that this film claimed the ""Old Testament"" God only harmed gays for ""ceremonial"" and customary reasons.  No God-respecting or self-respecting Christian could possibly believe this.  The obvious center argument is that homosexuality is still a sin but God wants only the perfect to cast the first stone.

Many people use the argument that Jesus refused to condemn gays, they ignored the fact that Jesus refused to condemn anyone.  Think about the most depraved sin you can think of; guess what, Jesus came not to condemn those people.  To say Jesus did not condemn gays is a moot point to trick people who don't study the Bible. The film also jokes that normal people should not study the Bible, it even in joke form references the fact that the Pope made it illegal for the common man to read the Bible. (And ignored what the Pope did to the millions of people who felt they needed to read the Bible to gain a personal relationship with God. The real reason why the Pope tried to prevent people from reading the Bible is because his universal Roman church's theology clearly contradicted the Bible and he wanted to retain power, by selling indulgences and such. This film ignores this.)

It is possible that God defines a sin as anything ""bad.""  If you study the Bible you may realize that most of the Leviticus laws are actually health laws. The vast majority of the Leviticus health laws are proven accurate.  These laws would have prevented a vast amount of human disease and suffering. So therefore it is possible that eating shrimp is dangerous because they are bottom feeders in the ocean.

How should a Christian react to sin? Well it is impossible not to sin.  But the first aspect of Christianity is to admit that you are sinful.  This is the main problem with the homosexual sin.  They can't admit that God may not have intended them to be that way and their lifestyle is just a result of human evil.

The obvious response to this movie from a Christian perspective is that being gay is still sin but so is sex outside of marriage and eating pork.  The first step to respecting Christ is the willingness to accept that you are an imperfect sinner.  The main contradiction with homosexuals and the Bible is they have choosen to reject the idea that their nature is sinful this is something that all Christians should accept.  What is the next step after admitting that you are a sinner you ask.  Well that is between you and your personal God.

I found the scientific definition of those kinds of people interesting this is something I had wondered about.  But at the end of the day, I would have to say that homosexality is a sin and a result of sin.  This scientific explanation does not contradict the Bible.  Science has also shown people are prone to violence and also cancer so explaining homosexuality scientifically, even though quite interesting, does not disprove the Bible's claim.",1212537600,8,3363,4.717465753424658

3263655,5,B000YHQNCI,This documentary deals with the insane idea that you can take the Bible literally from beginning to end.

It's aggressively polemical, it incorporates all the worst examples of Christian hate and extremism, it omits any treatment of gay extremists like you might see in San Francisco's Gay Pride Parade, and in several instances it presents ""experts"" without identifying them as aggressively pro-gay (eg, Peter Gomes of Harvard). But there's a good reason to watch this film, nevertheless, because it presents the personal stories of five families, without exception all of which are deeply Christian, and how they dealt with the news that their kids are gay. Two of the families are famous-- Chrissy Gephardt is the daughter of two-time presidential candidate and Missouri congressman Dick Gephardt, and Gene Robinson became the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church. Jake comes from the suburbs of Minneapolis, Tonia is an African-American who grew up on a dirt road in North Carolina before going to Yale, and then Anna was from Arkansas. These families run the Christian gamut -- United Church of Christ, African-American, Lutheran, Catholic, and fundamentalist, and they respond to their child's coming out in different ways.

Many people address different aspects (I won't say both sides, because it's more complicated than that) of religion vs. homosexuality, old ways vs. new thinking, and the journeys that families go through when a spouse or child comes out.

There is no voice-over from the filmmakers; they allow the subjects to speak for themselves, and this is quite effective; we can make up our own minds and ponder what they've said instead of being told what to think.

The story of Jay Reitan and his parents attempting to get their story to James Dobson at Focus on the Family was particularly moving.  Sadly, someone like Dobson has already made up his mind on the issue and is unwilling to consider anyone else's experience.

We still live in a world of religious fanatics who ""think"" they can interpret the bible, but this movie can relieve some of the guilt that has been instilled in so many LGBT people that were raised believing that God does not love them. I've read so many of the negative comments and one thing that I understand is that it is nearly impossible to change anyone's beliefs, but my hope is that by watching this documentary they will get the one singularly most important point. God loves all his creations and if you believe in His word, you MUST not judge nor hate. Ultimately, we each have to answer for our sins and one question that I have for all the hateful commenters is if anyone of you can recall the day that you CHOSE which sex you were going to be attracted to, please tell me that you had a choice! From original sin, the world is not as He intended it to be, so LGBT people may be a anomaly just like the many others, but continue to love then and let them live happily. It is not your place to condemn anyone when we live in an imperfect world. Spreading love whether or not you agree with anything is how God wants us to live, not filled with hate for someone who is different from yourself. I pray that whomever needs this movie gets to see it. I cried and felt relief in so many ways and though I am surrounded by my amazing family, who all accept and love me as I am, I was still carrying around the guilt that a religion made me believe for years that I am an abomination.
