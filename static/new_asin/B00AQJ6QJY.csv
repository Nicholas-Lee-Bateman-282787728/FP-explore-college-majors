5471242,4,B00AQJ6QJY,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 4-FILM BLU-RAY COLLECTION. This is the perfect completion to anyone's InuYasha collection. Seven box sets of DVDs, the new, concluding series and now the movies. I thought this was going to be the best part. It was, sort of. The presentation of this product is four films on two Blu-ray discs. Upon watching them, I noticed something peculiar: it looked like I was watching it on my own tube sets from the 1990s, not the 40in LCD in 24P mode. The films are presented in 1080i. That's right, INTERLACED. That went out with NTSC, DVD and VHS. I bought these because I honestly don't know of a single 1080i Blu-ray on the face of the earth. The reason I buy Blu-ray discs is to get the films in a progressive presentation. I don't know what the manufacturers of this disc was thinking, but I say WAIT until they fix this and rerelease it correctly. Four stars for the films, minus one for the sadly cheap interlaced presentation. Very depressing.",1364342400,29,966,4.557471264367816

5471244,2,B00AQJ6QJY,"The quality is good, but there is no way to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles. You can only watch it English dubbed, which is really a let down for me.",1502755200,2,161,4.0625

5471248,1,B00AQJ6QJY,Discs are zone A I am unable to watch it in Australia which is zone B. Would have been nice if that was included in the description for global customers. Very disappointing.,1496793600,2,173,4.4375

5471251,5,B00AQJ6QJY,"Great collection in one box. Also cheap. Recommend watch the series 1st to really understand the plot. It stands alone in some ways, as each movie refers to a phase in the series.",1493337600,,179,4.454545454545454

5471253,5,B00AQJ6QJY,"This set of movies is great!  If you love Inuyasha, then obviously you will enjoy these.  If you want to get someone interested in Inuyasha, then this is a good place to start.  The first movie in particular is a great introduction to the characters and setting that doesn't give away too much about the main plot.  If you want to watch some Inuyasha stories that are easy to get into and self-contained, this is the collection to get.  Inuyasha is a pleasure to watch in the format of movies; I found it satisfying to watch Inuyasha stories that have a beginning, middle, and end that don't stretch out over many, many episodes.

In my opinion, these are well worth the money.  The animation and effects are great, the stories are solid, and the characters are lovable as always.",1492473600,2,780,4.568345323741007

5471257,5,B00AQJ6QJY,"This is a great set. All four movies on two disks, the menu threw me for a little bit. I was so used to junkie bootleg DVD's (I know, shame on me) that I didn't realize that this had a decent menu until I started to get mad. I can't stand the English voices and had a difficult time figuring out how to change the audio and subtitles at first. Note to anyone who reads this, it's a ""Pop-up"" menu, LOL!",1486944000,3,401,3.962962962962963
5471258,5,B00AQJ6QJY,I've loved InuYasha since I was younger and first saw it on Adult Swim. I've loved it ever since and just recently decided to buy all the episodes and movies. I'm so glad I did!

5471264,5,B00AQJ6QJY,"For Inuyasha fans, these are welcome additional stories that take place before the end of the series. These are well-done movies that extend the Inuyasha saga and explain a few things missing from the main-line story. My entire family enjoyed the main story as well as these additions.",1478736000,,285,4.958333333333333

5471267,5,B00AQJ6QJY,I grew up on any Inuyasha and absolutely still love it to this day. I recently finished watching the Final Chapter. And I am so grateful that they gave this anime a happy ending. These movies were great and still are. All in pretty good quality and look just like I remember them. If you are a fan I highly recommend you give this collection a try you will not regret it.,1475452800,,371,4.166666666666667
5471268,2,B00AQJ6QJY,"This was a disappointing rarity in my anime purchases.
The purchase price was reasonable; the video quality was acceptable.
However, the sound quality was deplorable.
The English voice actors seemed to speak in whispers; even at 3/4 volume, they were practically undecipherable. I was forced to rely upon the captions. Even with a 400 watt Surroundsound system, attaining any sound quality was all to no avail. I am now repurchasing these movies singly, but in a standard DVD sound format.
This particular product gives Bluray a bad name.. I would advise you to avoid it at all costs.",1466985600,2,584,4.969387755102041

5471292,5,B00AQJ6QJY,"Absolutely convenient having all four movies on two Blu-ray discs.
It is mentioned in the comments that the 1080i quality is not true Blu-ray quality and also something about the picture quality to be poor.
I've watched all 4 movies already, actually finished the entire Inuyasha series as I've just today finished watching the last episode of the Final Act.
Anyway, the quality is good. It is definitely not bad in any way whatsoever, and I absolutely enjoyed watching the movies in 1080i Blu-ray quality and equally grateful that it's even made available in this Blu-ray quality.

If you don't have this, get it. Without this, your experience watching Inuyasha will just be incomplete.",1425340800,3,687,5.026315789473684

5471299,5,B00AQJ6QJY,"Alright, I'm going to start by saying that if you love InuYasha, I don't know why you haven't bought the movies already. Like why are you reading reviews? But for those of you who are on edge about buying them, wether or not you watch InuYasha, I'm gonna tell you it's a good buy. So for one it's all four movies on two DVDs, which I pointing out because I know some movies have just a large box of each movie! That's my favorite part easy storage! Second, the movies are great! You don't necessarily need to have finished the series to understand but it would help to at least have met Sango and Miroku before you plunge into the depths of these movies! But anyway, it's a good buy!",1412726400,7,683,4.2615384615384615
5471300,5,B00AQJ6QJY,A couple of the reviews have been confusing. Could someone who owns this set please tell me whether or not you need a bluray player to watch?,1410566400,,141,4.2592592592592595

5471303,1,B00AQJ6QJY,"I bought a Blu Ray drive so that I could play and record Blu Ray disks. However, the leash that Sony puts on Blu Ray means that a Blu Ray drive can not play a Blu Ray disk without an additional $50 Blu Ray software. I will not be buying either the software or another Blu Ray disk.

So I tried it on someone else's Blu Ray player (a Samsung) and was able to access all of the features, except being able to turn on subtitles and choose English. If I understood Japanese, I would rate this a little higher, but to find that a Blue Ray player can not access features of a Blu Ray disk is another reason this will be my last Blu Ray purchase.

This disk has a few line art gallery stills for each movie and credits in english. That is the entirety of the bonus material. The DVD's give you a lot more there. Skip this one and buy either a set of movie DVD's, or individual movie DVD packages. Perhaps even your local library will have these in the YA Anime section.",1401494400,3,962,4.084656084656085

If you're an InuYasha fan who enjoys these movies or would like to see them, and are looking for a good deal, and have a blu-ray player, 10/10 MUST BUY. They each have their own side plot twisted off from the main series and introduce some brand-new characters, which is great!

5471306,3,B00AQJ6QJY,"In the product description it clearly says that the CDs of the movie soundtracks are included along with a booklet about the various instruments/composers.  It was wrong.  All that's in it is the movies themselves, which are definitely not worth $20.  Don't get me wrong, I like the Inuyasha movies (especially the third one) but the only reason I bought the Blu-ray multipack was for the soundtracks.  Otherwise I would have just bought them separately because I hate multi-packs, they drive me nuts and Blu-ray is even worse!  The movies are great but if you're buying this because the product description says that it has the soundtracks?  Don't even bother.",1391558400,2,661,4.963636363636364

It has all here, the movies I mean. If you're looking for the bonus features from the original DVDs, they're not here. It only has 2 discs, but there are 2 movies each on them. Personally, I find this to be a time saver. Plus the 2 best movies out of all of them, 3 & 4, are on 1 disc. It has the Dub & the Japanese audio, so there's that.

5471313,5,B00AQJ6QJY,"In Japan, there are few manga/anime series that have lasting power for more than ten years.  Let alone be created by a mangaka who has achieved it multiple times.

Rumiko Takashi, best known for anime TV series hits such as ""Urusei Yatsura"", ""Maison Ikkoku"", ""Ranma 1/2 began her manga series ""InuYasha"" in 1996, while in 2000 the animated series followed and a sequel to close the series was released in 2009-2010.  By the end of InuYasha, a total of 56 manga volumes were created, 167 episodes from 2000-2004 and the final 26 episodes from 2009-2010.

A very popular series that has captivated anime audiences for many years, with a franchise that led to video games, novels, soundtracks and a live action play, as customary for popular animated series, ""InuYasha"" also a total of four animated films created.

In 2001, ""InuYasha the Movie 1: Affections Touching Across Time""; in 2002, ""InuYasha the Movie: The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass""; in 2003, ""InuYasha the Movie 3: Swords of an Honorable Ruler""; and in 2004, ""InuYasha the Movie: Fire on the Mystic Island"".

While Viz Media released a DVD box set featuring all four films in 2007, Viz Media will be releasing a Blu-ray release with all four films in 2013 in HD with lossless audio.

Here is a brief spoiler-free synopsis of each film:

In ""InuYasha the Movie 1: Affections Touching Across Time"", we learn that 200 years ago, InuYasha's father defeated the powerful Chinese moth yokai known as Hyoga.  With a Shikon Jewel fragment having freed Hyoga's son, Menomaru, he now wants revenge on anything related to InuYasha's father and that is by destroying InuYasha.

Along with his two minions, Ruri and Hari, the three attack InuYasha and friends.  Ruri duplicating Miroku's Wind Tunnel, Hari possessing Kirara and Menomaru cursing Kagome, can the group find a way to beat Menomaru?

In ""InuYasha the Movie 2: The Castle Beyond Looking Glass"", as the group continues their search for Shikon Jewel Shards, Kagura and Kanna continue on without Naraku (who is thought to be dead).  The two find a mirror inside the shrine and they awaken Kaguya, Princess of the Heavens. Kaguya promises Kagura her eternal freedom if she can recover five items that will free her from the mirror.

The two end up confronting InuYasha and friends and Kaguya ends up using her power to kidnap Kagome.  Now the group must try to rescue her.

For ""InuYasha the Movie 3: Swords of an Honorable Ruler"", we see a past when InuYasha was about to be born.  We see Takemaru killing Lady Izayoi before InuYasha's father arrives.  When InuYasha's father arrives, he resurrects Izayoi with the Tenseiga and he tells her to escape with his son InuYasha and gives her the Cloth of the Fire Rat to protect them from the burning palace.  And the final image shows InuYasha dying in the fire as he tried to face Takemaru.

In the present time, Kagome's grandfather finds a sword which is to be kept in the storehouse.  Kagome's younger brother finds it and the sword reveals itself to be Saiya and is seeking out InuYasha.  But why does the sword want InuYasha?

For ""InuYasha the Movei 4: Fire on the Mystic Island"", a small group of children on Horai Island watch a woman that looks like Kikyo in a green orb. Immediately, the Cauldron of Resonance comes to life and the mark of the Four War Gods (Ryuura, Juura, Kyoura and Goura) appear on all of the children's backs except the youngest child, Ai.  Asagi, the oldest child tells ai to run and leave the island and the Four War Gods try to go after her.  But just in time, InuYasha and the others come to her rescue.  Which leads to a battle between InuYasha and friends and the Four War Gods.

VIDEO:

For picture quality, all four films are presented in 1080i 169 video.  Because these films were made between 2001-2004, the films are upconverted.  With that being said, the benefit of watching a film that has been upconverted is much better than a TV series because of the better production quality.  Even the 2001 film ""Affections Touching Across Time"" doesn't look soft and looks better that a lot of the upconverted anime films that I have seen.  Of course, the more recent the film, the better production quality, so the fourth film ""Fire on the Mystic Island"" does have a slight edge compared to the older films.

But people should not worry as all four films that have been upconverted in HD looks amazing on Blu-ray!  Colors are vibrant, picture quality just looks better than it's previous DVD counterpart.

AUDIO:

All four films are presented in English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. It's important to note that if you want to watch with Japanese with English subtitles, you can't select subtitles or audio but have to go through the setup menu to make the changes.

There is a significant difference between the English and Japanese lossless soundtrack.  The English has a better dynamic range and utilizes the surround channels for sound effects and music, while the Japanese lossless soundtrack is primarily front and center-channel driven.

With that being said, all films, especially the English lossless soundtracks sound very good.  I have to admit that I expected a similar dynamic range for the Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack to its English counterpart, but that's not the case.  While the soundtrack is crisp and clear for the Japanese lossless track, the English track does get a nod for better use of the surround channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Inuyasha: The Movie the Complete Collection"" comes with production art, English credits and trailers for each film (except the first).

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a long time fan of Rumiko Takahashi's works, one thing that I have learned is that you really can't go wrong with any of her longtime series.  While I grew up during the ""Ranma 1/2, ""Urusei Yatsura"" and ""Maison Ikkoku"" years, I have also been captivated by this ongoing storyline of ""InuYasha"" and the series' characters.

While I enjoyed the TV series, the films are much more emotional, relevant to the series and of course, the production quality is much better than its TV series counterpart.

With the first film ""Affections Touching Across Time"", I suppose what I found appealing for the first film is the fact that the storyline revisits InuYasha's father, specifically an old enemy of his father and also the connection between InuYasha and Kagome.  The first time I watched the film, I thought it was a very touching and emotional film building the relationship and connection of these two characters.  You see a little of it in the TV series but the films really explore their bond.

By the second film ""The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass"", this film brings back Kagura but also explores the fact that Naruku may be alive.  But for Kagura fans, it's definitely one of the major battles featuring Kagura and InuYasha but it's great to see the series' antagonist show up for the second film (as most anime series tend to feature an enemy just created for the film version).

The third film is actually one of my favorites as it deals with InuYasha's birth but also an enemy named Takemaru that is connected to the death of InuYasha's mother and his father.  The third film was definitely one of the darkest films and a storyline in which we see both brothers, InuYasha and Sesshomaru actually working together.  Similar to the first film, we get to know more about InuYasha's family but in this case, the death of his parents.

And for the final fourth film ""Fire on the Mystic Island"", InuYasha and the others take on the Four War Gods and once again, everyone shows up in the film in battle.  Where this film focuses on children who have been possess by the Four War Gods, the film is not too childish and focuses on plenty of action.

As for the Blu-ray release, it's important to remember that this is an upconvert of the animated films presented in 1080i.  I know there are people who try to shy away from upconverts but in this case, because of the higher production value put into animated films versus a TV series, each of the four films presented in ""InuYasha: The Movie the Complete Collection"" look very good!

The release of the four ""InuYasha"" films on Blu-ray for $20 is an excellent deal.  Considering that on DVD, these four films as a set used to be priced around $50-$60.  Also, with the upconvert to 1080i, colors are much more vibrant and overall picture quality looks so much better.  The same can be said with the lossless soundtrack, although the English dub soundtrack seems to sound much better and utilized more for the surround channels versus its Japanese lossless soundtrack.

Overall, four ""InuYasha"" films for $21 on Blu-ray?  You better believe it!  Not only is it cheaper than the older DVD box set but all four films are presented with better picture and audio quality. You are definitely getting your money's worth with this Blu-ray release!

""InuYasha: The Movie the Complete Collection"" is highly recommended!",1372896000,17,9009,4.792098445595855

5471318,5,B00AQJ6QJY,For the Inuyasha fan this is a must have. I own this collection on DVD so when I saw it available on blu-ray I got it right away. Blu-ray version is definitely worth it as the anime seems to come alive that much more. Four movies on two disks.,1368144000,5,243,3.979591836734694

5471320,3,B00AQJ6QJY,"While I am glad that they have released this to bluray I am disappointed that the discs have little to no artwork, there is no insert for each movie like in the dvd version of this collection, and there is no menu movies just play from the start. My other complaint is the special features always crash out my blu-ray players. It did this on my Samsung bluray player and my PlayStation 3. Now onto the positive of the set. Cuts the shelf space by half of the DVD set version. It puts two movies to a disc so if I want to a have a back to back session I can. With the DVD version of the movies I sometimes got tiling in during playback of high action scenes where in the bluray the picture quality did not falter once. If you already own the DVD set I don't really see a reason for upgrading unless you are quality person like me or its just time to replace the set.",1365724800,,865,4.064327485380117

as for the Blu-ray content itself:
the back of the box says it's 1080i, however my player has no problem up-converting it to 1080p and quite frankly i think the picture quality looks absolutely phenomenal!! audio is English 5.1 & 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio (with or without english subtitles) and Japanese 5.1 & 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio (with english subtitles, there's no option to turn them off with this setting). with that being said i think this set is well worth purchasing",1364688000,2,904,4.512195121951219
