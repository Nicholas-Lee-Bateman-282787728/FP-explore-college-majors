5957536,5,B00EYZUEOY,"First of all i want to say that this box set is absolutely gorgeous. The packaging is solid and well made and each dvd comes in a small case with the year of release on the spine, character art on the front, and a synopsis on the back. The insides of these cases have different patterns for each movie and the blu-ray discs match these patterns. It also contains a small booklet containing information about each movie such as box office numbers and fun facts. It is a beautiful collection that every pixar fan will enjoy.

HOWEVER

As people have mentioned there are some region encoding issues and since nobody has been very specific id like to clear this up.

Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up will not play on american blu-ray players (this includes the ps3, couldn't test ps4). Bugs life is listed as being region B (europe) only but plays just fine. both of the shorts collections play as well. i didn't test the cars shorts disc because i couldn't care less about cars.

aside from these 3, every movie plays flawlessly and looks gorgeous on Blu Ray. This is a great collection for pixar fans. thankfully the movies that are region locked are recent and thus it shouldnt be hard to fill in the gaps in the collection for those who must have them all.",1390867200,13,1250,4.517699115044247
5957537,5,B00EYZUEOY,I got this as a gift for my newborn niece as her first Christmas present. I know she will enjoy these movies as much as I did growing up.,1390521600,,137,3.7586206896551726
5957538,2,B00EYZUEOY,"The item arrived fast and packed nicely. It was brand-new and looked really nice in it's collection packaging. I got this collection as a Christmas gift for my husband and he was really excited because he really wanted this. However, he recalled that he had seen some reviews that said that a few movies did not play. After opening the package, we checked that every single movie was playable (we played them in our PS4) and sure enough, 3 movies did not play. What upsets me the most is that 2 of those are my husband's favorites (Wall-E and Up). I checked the item description and it did say ""ALL REGIONS"", this is why I purchased this item. After contacting the seller, they told me that I had misunderstood something. That the description said ""REGION FREE B2"". They even told me to dowload a software so that I could play the movies on my PC. I think I'm going to end up buying these 3 movies at Best Buy or something. Don't get me wrong, it's a cute present and this would have been a perfect purchase if all of the movies had played on my PS4. Just make sure you confirm with the seller that all movies are ""ALL REGIONS"". And please, do not purchase from Modern House as they are absolutely unreasonable and they tried to blame everybody but themselves when it was clearly their fault.",1388102400,67,1292,4.432773109243698
5957539,5,B00EYZUEOY,Purchased from amazon.co.uk and I live in the US.  Works just fine on my PS4.  Haven't tried on my PC or PS3.  COMPLETE collection with shorts and Cars animated series.,1385683200,4,168,4.533333333333333
5957540,5,B00EYZUEOY,my best friend is a pixar fan and this is the perfect gift i was a bit disappointed when it arrived as the box was damaged,1437609600,,122,3.730769230769231
5957541,4,B00EYZUEOY,"I love that the box set includes almost every Pixar feature film to date - excluding the most recent release. However, a couple of the films (Up and Wall-E) are not compatible with our Blu-Ray player due to a country code issue. It's possible that a newer player may have additional software to compensate for this, but alas, I have not decided to shell out for the new device yet.
All-in-all, it's a comprehensive collection of your favorite Pixar films in a neat looking (albeit, soft cornered) cardboard box.",1436572800,,511,4.752808988764045
5957542,3,B00EYZUEOY,The wall-e disc will not play in any device. This is very dissapointing.,1433548800,3,72,4.615384615384615

5957544,1,B00EYZUEOY,"Four popular movies locked to Europe (Region B) :
Ratatouille
Up
Wall-E
Bug's Life

Every seller use Region Free in title. It is completely unacceptable. DON'T BUY if you planning to use it in US.",1428796800,4,196,4.6
5957545,2,B00EYZUEOY,"The quality of the product is great. HOWEVER, about half of these DVDs are region specific - unfortunately, that region is not the US which means half of these movies are unwatachable and completely useless. The vendor is unwilling to replace the region specific discs, so buyer beware!",1424908800,6,286,4.979166666666667
5957546,5,B00EYZUEOY,"I bought this for my five year old sister for christmas and she loves it. The packaging had a miniscule tear on one of the corners, but it didn't matter because the rest of the packaging was in good shape and the DVD's have all worked. It was a bit pricy, but definitely a worthy investment.",1423440000,2,291,4.214285714285714

5957548,4,B00EYZUEOY,"The box came in fast and in good condition. The only problem is that I cant watch some of the movies because they have a region code on them and won't play on a PS3. You might not have this problem on a regular blue-ray player that doesn't have restrictions, or the PS4 because i don't think it has that block on it for movies. Otherwise, It's an awesome collection for the price and saves a lot of space (and money) then if you were to buy them individually.",1414368000,5,459,4.168539325842697
5957549,5,B00EYZUEOY,"For some people the region B coding on the discs may be a problem, but I haven't had any issues working around it. All discs come in their own sleeve with the year it was released, and the region code is printed on each disc. Wonderful collection for anybody that likes animation.",1396915200,6,280,4.403846153846154
8610476,2,B00EYZUEOY,"The box came damaged and 3 movies didn't work. The other reviews said that so we expected that. They were Up, Wall-E, and Ratatouille. It looked like someone punched the box and then wrapped it in bubble wrap",1524268800,,208,4.5
8610477,4,B00EYZUEOY,"This box set has everything you could possibly want if you love the work of pixar. Though I did find that since this product is originally from europe, 3 of the movies will not play in my north american coded player (Up, Ratatouille and WALL-E). Other then that though this is a great way to collect all the classic pixar movies and the current ones (up to Cars 2/Monster's University) in north america, since for some odd reason disney hasn't graced our shores with a collection like this one.",1487116800,,494,4.561797752808989
8610478,1,B00EYZUEOY,"Sadly Several movies didn't work out of the box. They would start by asking what language then load for several minutes and never begin... We returned hoping to get a good set, but find this is an issue with his product through reviews...",1461369600,2,238,4.558139534883721

8610480,5,B00EYZUEOY,"As the reviewers have obviously made clear, 3 of the movies are region locked. Ratatoullie, Wall-e, and UP. It does say A Bug's Life is region B but it has played fine on my US Phillips Blu Ray and PlayStation 4. Other than that, this set is just stellar and it's definitely my favorite Blu Ray purchase to date. The cases are creative and fun despite the cheap material. And what else can I say about the films? They're Pixar! Buy this set if you can find a good deal!!",1453161600,,470,4.233333333333333
8610481,2,B00EYZUEOY,"I wrote a earlier review about the disk not working it's a sub total of 3 Up, wall E, & ratatouille but it's pretty nice other than that hoping the 3 can be replaced it would be very nice seeing how its 200+$",1450396800,3,208,3.86046511627907
