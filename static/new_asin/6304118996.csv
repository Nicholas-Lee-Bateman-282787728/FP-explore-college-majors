7863065,4,6304118996,"I have been a classical music announcer for the local public radio station in Asheville NC for over 30 years and it always comes as a surprise to people when I tell them that I don't like opera. My standard reply is ""I love the music, the costumes, and the staging, I just wish they wouldn't sing so much"". That observation also sums up the virtues and the flaws in this 1944 Universal feature which was intended to capitalize on the success of Universal's 1943 remake of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. It was also intended to capitalize on the return to movies of Boris Karloff who had just finished a 3 year run on Broadway in ARSENIC & OLD LACE. It also marked the first time that Karloff had ever appeared in a color movie which clearly shows off his East Indian heritage if you're aware of it.

Susanna Foster, who really could sing (her range featured a B above high C), was cast once again as a singing ingenue under the influence of a Svengali like individual just as she had been in PHANTOM the year before. This time instead of Claude Rains as the Phantom she is under the influence of Karloff, the opera house doctor who tries to prevent her from singing through hypnosis. His reason for doing this involves a singer he idolized who disappeared 10 years before and Susanna sounds just like her. ""I shall poison your voice"" he intones and for awhile he succeeds. Just as Suzanna had Nelson Eddy in PHANTOM, she has 1940s B leading man Turhan Bey here to save the day. He's actually quite good and helps to keep THE CLIMAX watchable during the romantic love scenes.

Although I admit to being an unabashed BK fan, the 4 star rating is not purely subjective. The movie is beautifully photographed in 1940s Technicolor and the supporting performances are stronger than those in PHANTOM. The opera scores are a pastiche of melodies (to avoid royalties) but they are wonderfully sung (Foster's voice is truly amazing) while the stagings are kitschy in the best Viennese/Hollywood tradition. Then there is BK's voice which has never been more mesmerizing or sonorous than it is here. As far as I'm concerned, the scene where he hypnotizes Foster is the highlight of the film from both a visual and aural perspective. Despite Karloff's presence THE CLIMAX is not a horror film but a tragic melodrama with lots of operatic singing. Keep that in mind before or while you are watching it so then you know what you are letting yourself in for.",1503792000,,2437,4.587155963302752
7863066,4,6304118996,I enjoyed this film mainly because I am an avid Turhan Bey fan.  The only disappointment is that I did not know it was available on DVD.  I would have  preferred that to VHS.,1355875200,,174,4.0588235294117645
7863067,5,6304118996,"Great cast and in true Universal style.  A good thriller.  Good production, great sets.  Very nice music and great costume piece.",1352764800,,129,5.0476190476190474
7863068,2,6304118996,"Universal had a great success with the 1943 The Phantom of the Opera and planned a sequel to reunite Susannah Foster and Claude Rains--but Rains, who feared becoming typed as a horror star, declined.  The story and script then underwent drastic revisions, and the result was the 1944 The Climax.

Dr. Friedrich Hohner (Boris Karloff) was madly in love with a prima dona; when she rejected him, he killed her and keeps her corpse preserved in a sort of Snow White coffin room complete with eternal flame and filmy draperies.  Ten years later he encounters a second prima dona, Angela Klatt (Susanna Foster), whose voice is remarkably like his lost love.  Dr. Hohner determines to control her voice--and if unable to control it, destroy it forever.  Fortunately, Angela has supporters in the form of lover Franz Munzer (Turhan Bey) and the mysterious Luise (Gale Sondergaard.)  Needless to say, the whole thing turns out very much the way you think it will.

The film is probably most memorable for its art design, which is Technicolor-glossy at its best.  Unfortunately, The Climax doesn't give either Karloff or Foster a lot to do, and although he was an attractive player, Bey is significantly miscast as the leading man.  Sondergaard gives the best performance of the lot, very over the top but extremely entertaining.  The opera sequences are vaguely hilarious--the whole thing comes off rather like half 1940s pop music, half girly show--and both script and story are extremely awkward.  If you're a die-hard Karloff fan, you'll probably want to wade through it, but The Climax is anti-climatic, to say the least, a slow trudge uphill all the way.

7863069,5,6304118996,"My sister and I were able to see this movie on regular broadcast television many times as we grew up.  We wanted to BE Angela Klatt, had mad crushes on the hopeless romantic and bumbling Franz, and it created in each of us a love for musical performance that we still revel in.  Oh, to be even in the chorus of those magical musical numbers ""Powder for Her Nose"" or ""The Magic Voice"". Of course the real dream was to be the coloratura singing star Miss Klatt.  Somehow mom bravely endured hearing us try to out sing one another on those high C's.  We were spellbound every time we saw it - and even though we knew the story, we always secretly feared that Luise was the true villain as the movie began each time.  As one other reviewer cited - the amazing costumes were another wonderful part of the movie, and the sets worthy of Ziegfeld or Busby-Berkeley extravaganzas!  Definitely a must see for anyone who loves the theatre!  Thanks to The Climax - we both now perform at our local community theatre regularly!",1277856000,7,1014,4.448648648648649
7863070,4,6304118996,"""The Climax"" provides Boris Karloff not only with his first Technicolor film, but audiences with a handsome, humdinger of a mustache-twisting Victorian melodrama.

True, the story is not supernatural, but what does that matter when Boris keeps his deceased girl friend preserved beneath a gauze shroud in a secret room? If this is not sufficient, then just savor the mouth watering color photography, art direction and costumes.

This is one of the most visually handsome color films from the 40's, and ranks favorably against Minnelli's ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" in the warmth, depth, and clarity of its chromatic range, whilst simultaneously recalling Twentieth Century Fox's lighting schemes from ""The Little Princess,"" and anticipating ""Blanche Fury"" in its tonal subtleties.

The settings are both sumptuous and historically accurate, (sharp eyed viewers will note that some of the same props show up later in Ulmer's ""Bluebeard,"") and provide the perfect background for the cloak and dagger theatrics.

Not to be outdistanced are Vera West's (one of Hollywood's most undervalued designers) late Victorian gowns--each a marvel of velvet, chiffon, plumes, and various embroideries, not to mention being a testament to the lost art of dressmaking.

Susanna Foster not only wears them charmingly, but sings like an angel, until Boris hypnotizes her. Thereafter, she is a bit somnambulistic--something of a problem given an impending operatic engagement.

Not to worry though, a turban-less Turhan Bey will save the day, in a nick of time, allowing Susanna to hit her high C on opening night, as scowling villain Karloff rushes off to a succulent fate.

That fate, as depicted, with Uncle Boris collapsing on a curtained bier that is laden with the corpse of his long dead (though still photogenic) inamorata, as they both go up in flames, is as aesthetically and dramatically delicious as they come.

One can almost imagine the the whoops of the popcorn patrons as they cheered this pyrotechnic finale in the Rialto's of yesteryear.

Not to be missed.",1166140800,3,2050,5.225609756097561
7863071,3,6304118996,"Slow moving tale of mad doctor on the loose in the Vienna Opera is not as sinister as one would hope. Karloff is okay and Sondergaard good as the watchful housekeeper, but it is the state of the art Technicolor - here  perfectly and impeccably restored - that is the real star.  Watch for this  reason alone.  Sumptuous color design.  Oscar nom for Art Direction but it  deserved nods for Costumes and Score as well.",933206400,11,416,4.48
7863072,3,6304118996,"This film is an obvious follow up to Phantom of the Opera ,showcasing Susanna Foster. As in ""Phantom"" she is superb. Karloff does his best with a weak script. Turhan Bey acts like a lovesick teenager for most  of the film. Color and staging, as in ""Phantom"", is outstanding. No  one sings like Foster;not Durbin, MacDonald or any of filmdoms canarys. She  is one of a kind! View it for the music if for no other reason. Oh yes,Foster  and her clothes are gorgeous.",930787200,9,464,4.488095238095238
