2529377,3,B000EQ5V3Q,"Echo is another telling of the old tale of a successful man family and career wise, that becomes the obsession of a jealous twin that he didn't know he had, who has had in the jealous one's eyes a much easier and privileged life that should have been his, who instead had to endure a rougher life full of hardship.  Jack Wagner does a good job as playing Max (the guy with the successful life) and Steven (the jealous twin), who was left behind in the hospital as his injuries were too expensive for the aunt and uncle to cope with after his parents and sister were killed after his father freaked out when a tin of paint hit his windshield on a motorway that had no other cars on it at the time and he simply could have brought the car to a stop while looking out the side windows.  Initially I had no idea that the car crash and Wagner's characters were supposed to be the kids, it took a while for me to realise this start of the film was a flashback.

This is a likely made for TV film, its quality is of such anyway.  Like a lot of these TV movies in the mid to late 90's, they used a well known TV star as the draw card.  Obviously Wagner was famous at the time for the top rating Melrose Place where he played Dr Burns. He's been in The Bold & The Beautiful, General Hospital and a few other soapies since then.  They don't usually have two TV stars in these, but this one uses the much used in the 90's budget movie film actress Alexandra Paul (Baywatch) as Max's wife.  Thankfully she isn't responsible for carrying this film's plot as is only a minor character really, although she is in some key scenes. The fact that she has played so many ditzy made to go straight to TV movie characters makes the fact she doesn't catch on that the imposter isn't her husband straight away a bit more believable.  This was made before The Walking Dead, but fans of that great series will recognise Laurie Holden (Andrea Harrison on that show) as Scarlet, Max's secretary who other than Wagner, has the most screen time interaction with Max and Steven.  Three actors you'll recognise is actually pretty good for a budget DVD and you might even recognise another face or two from other made for TV movies, if you've seen a few of them.

The overall storyline though is a bit weak, it doesn't really cover any new ground that you haven't seen before in similar movie or read in novels using the same plot.  I also can't see how Max doesn't remember having a brother since he was obviously old enough to at the time of the accident. Spoilers follow as I want to talk about the ending.  Sure most of the film hasn't broken new ground but really we've seen the old, I don't which of you is the real you so which do I shoot ending to this plot so many times before.  Then the possible twist in the months later update of did she shoot the right one?  Surely they could have come up with something a bit more original than that.",1449273600,,2917,4.260869565217392

2529383,5,B000EQ5V3Q,"What can one say about Jack Wagner other than he is the ""king"" of these type movies.  This movie is suspenseful, keeping you on the edge of your seat.  Don't want to give too many plot details as there are too many spoilers out there.  This movie should be viewed the first time without any outside influence.
