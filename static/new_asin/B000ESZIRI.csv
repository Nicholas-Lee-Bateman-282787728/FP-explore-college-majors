8114062,4,B000ESZIRI,"This DVD has some good information on swim technique, and pool drills to prepare you for open water swimming. The demonstrations for the pool, and open water are well shot, and well narrated so you know exactly what is happening, and why it's important. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because alot of things can go wrong swimming in open water, and these situations were not discussed much.",1328832000,,391,4.6
8114063,1,B000ESZIRI,"This is a very solid DVD on essential swimming techniques for triathletes.  It has all the essentials on sighting, drafting, and safety; however, I find the most useful section to be basic freestyle tips.  Though not intended to be a DVD on freestyle, it probably has the best illustrations and guidance on core-based freestyle techniques.",1220572800,4,339,5.1454545454545455
8114064,5,B000ESZIRI,"Whether you compete in open water swimming or in an olympic pool, this video is very helpful. There's plenty of great tips. Visual aides helps the text one reads in triathlete training books. This video is a very useful compliment to any triathlete or competitive athlete book. One year a triathlon may be in a pool and you may be surprised to learn the next year the event has been moved to open water swimming. You need this video.",1203465600,4,433,4.493670886075949
