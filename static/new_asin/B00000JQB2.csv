1236351,1,B00000JQB2,"Yes, Daeie made this pitiful attempt of a movie just before it went bankrupt, and it shows, oh BOY does it show!  This is quite possibly the worst of all the Gamera movies, ""Gamera vs. Zigra"" included.  Not even little kids will be able to sit through this.",952128000,,257,4.333333333333333
1236352,1,B00000JQB2,"This flick is among the very worst of Gamera movies.  Very simply, Gamera has to save two boys from the clutches of aliens who control Guiron, the monster known for nothing else than having a cheap kitchen knife for a  head.  DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS FLICK...instead, check out one of the  three 1990's Gamera movies.  In all honesty.",946944000,5,337,4.6440677966101696
1236353,1,B00000JQB2,"Did you guys know that Daiei made this movie right before they went bankrupt.  Yes, I said bankrupt.  And that's no excuse!  This is just one BAD movie.  Gamera even looks embarrassed to be in it.  Zigra is okay, but  check out the scene on the end where he falls on his face and the hatch on  top of the rubber costume's head pops open!  Duh duh duh!  It's worse  than Megalon!",943315200,2,378,4.125
1236354,5,B00000JQB2,"Well, where else are you gonna see a Japanese monster movie where a space monster with a ginsu blade on his head slices up a silver winged gyaos like a big rubber bloodless sausage?  Or a movie where a 150 foot turtle does  aerobic flips off two poles connecting some buildings?  No where! 1 So buy  this corny, badly dubbed Gamera classic NOW!",943315200,,344,4.412698412698413
1236355,4,B00000JQB2,"Its all here - the bad english dubbing, the cheapest effects, and some hilarious cheezy moments that make it a must see for fans of japanese monster flicks.  I rented this tonight and it being my first ever  experience of a Gamera movie.  Gamera protects two kids who were kidnapped  in a spaceship and taken to a planet where Guillon is the head honcho.  When Guillon first appears, he uses his head to cut off the wings, a foot,  and the head of a flying monster.  Classic, but kid stuff?",941846400,,490,4.377777777777778
7913132,2,B00000JQB2,"Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969)
Gamera vs. the Devil-Beast Giron
AKA Attack Of The Monsters

Mysterious messages from space. Soon two mischievous boys Akio and Tomoko checking out their telescope spot a space ship that looks like a tinker toy top. It conveniently land s in an empty lot and is undetected by anyone else. Naturedly they enter the ship and play with the interments. Yep they are being bratnaped. Fussy space beings change themselves into slick chicks. Soon they learn of Gamera from looking at reruns of previous movies in Akio's puny brain. His tasty puny brain.

Can Gamera save them or will it take Officer Kondo?
Hopefully the kids will be dispatched before they can make the obligatory
""We should all work together"" speech.

A Japanese film that is fourth in a series. It is dubbed in English. Really hockey graphics and while Giron makes a fair terradactyl but Gamera looks like a large space going turtle with a huge under-bite and file coming from behind.",1504915200,,979,4.815476190476191
7913133,3,B00000JQB2,"First off, let me say, that I love the Gamera films. As others have said before it mystifies you that these films are geared toward children audiences and yet, the violence and violent themes abound.

The deliciously wicked and attractive female aliens in this film want to eat our young heroes brains. In a wonderful cameo, a silver Space Gaos gets sliced and diced by Guiron, thus showing his powerful might. This film rocks!

Yes, we laugh at the comical fight between Gamera and Guiron as he spins round and round on the metal building support like a kaiju athletic star. Yes, we love it when Guiron materializes metal shurikens in his head from no where and fires them at Gamera's eyes. Gruesome yet hilariously fun at the same time.

If you want to have some brews with the boys and watch a TOTALLY entertaining Japanese monster flick - you should check out this poorly dubbed wonder. It is as fun as ""Godzilla Vs. Megalon"" and is a great double feature with ""Gamera Vs. Viras"" (aka: Destroy All Planets) and/or ""Gamera Vs. Jiger"" (aka: Gamera Vs. Monster X).",1123891200,,1065,4.654255319148936
7913134,2,B00000JQB2,"Gamera is back in the 5th installment gamera vs this knife monster they called guiron. I own all 8 gamera flicks and to say
this one was kinda bad. It seem cheesy in ever way. The dubbing of course is really bad and the whole Guiron monster was alright but instead of a knife head monster why they don't use a fork lol. I know gamera films were on a tight budget but they really made a mess on this one. Alright monster action but story lacks hard.",1079827200,,448,4.1022727272727275
7913135,5,B00000JQB2,"Yes, this is on of the worst of the Gamera films, and yes, it is incredibly poorly made.  But it still shows effort and charm in the process of its unbelievability.  The special effects are horrible, the acting is horrible, and the plot is horrible.  But it is the charm of sitting there and seeing our favorite turtle in a film that makes it all worth while.  I actually fin it a quite entertaining film, and it's still miles above the recent release of Pearl Harbor.",1010016000,,468,4.406976744186046
7913136,3,B00000JQB2,"Gamera vs Guillon, is the fifth film of the original Gamera series. This film is mainly aimed for children. This is a monster film from the worst period of the Kaju films; Shoe string budget, silly story, silly monsters - But a lot of charm!
Story; Did you know that there's a kind of ""anti Earth"", a planet orbiting the sun on the same distance as Earth? Now you know! This planet called Terra, mirrors Earth's orbit and is invincible to us, because it's on the opposite side of the sun. But Terra is a haunted and a dying planet; Space Gyaos roams its surface!
2 boys, investigate a strange landed spacecraft - Suddenly, the spacecraft takes off!
But the trip seem to be cut short; A huge interstellar rock is on collision course to their space ship...
Suddenly Gamera appears, and saves them! But something doesn't seem to be right; Gamera don't like the way, where they are heading...
At Terra they discover a horrible world of monsters, and Guillon seems to be the worst brute of them all...
They also meet two beautiful women; Barbella and Flobella - They seem to be nice, but there's more than meet the eye...
I've given this film 3 stars - Mainly because of its charm. The film has also very few reused monster scenes from earlier films. (Which was a very common in the end of the 1960s)
Technically this film is bad; Small budget, bad miniatures, bad monstersuits and some silly monsters designs.
This edition is a quality one; Hard video box, trailers and theatrical stills after the film, and a lot of info on the two sided cover sleeve. It's also is subtitled, not dubbed - Which me, from a non-English speaking country, without tradition of dubbing - Appreciates a lot!
Thanks, Neptune media!",1005004800,4,1705,4.593442622950819
7913137,4,B00000JQB2,"It's been a long time since I had watched any of the older Gamera movies except for Zigra - dubbed.
Watching this movie subtitled and letterboxed was great. I was a little surprised at how wide the original frame was. I definitely recommend watching it on a larger TV. The subtitles are in the bottom part of the screen, not covering any portion of the movie itself.
I liked the basic story. Yes, it might be considered a B-movie in many ways. Most (if not all) of the older Gamera movies had a limited budget, and I like seeing how creative a group can be when they can't be reckless with money like many American movies.
It does get annoying when almost no adult will believe the children. The policeman is the only one willing to at least listen even if he doesn't believe. He also seems to provide some comic element to the movie. He's just goofy in general. Kon Omura who plays the police office is a Japanese comedian whose work often focused on kids.
With all of the Neptune Media tapes I've seen so far, the backside of the insert has additional information on the movies. This one includes an interview with Omura and some comments from the director, Noriaki Yuasa.
One of the alien women is named Barbella which makes me think of a certain character Jane Fonda played. (""Barbarella"" which was released one year earlier)
Although these movies are often viewed as children's films, I think some parents might object to a few scenes - especially the fight between Guillon and Space Gyaos. I personally have no trouble with it, but I know some parents are strict about what their kids can see.",979171200,,1599,4.555555555555555

7913139,4,B00000JQB2,"This has got to be one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen in my entire life! I am a huge fan of old japanese monster movies and this one is one of my favorites! Some of the best of the Gamera series, stars Guiron,  who stands on 4 legs who also sprouts a huge knife on his head who he uses  to slice apart other monsters, 2 alien women who are trying to eat two  little kids and of course Gamera, who shows one of his skinniest and  funniest costumes ever. Zigra also appears just briefly as he gets limbs  sliced off by Guiron, obviously Zigra dies, but as he lies on the ground  dying, Guiron slowly cuts him into smaller pieces (really graphic for a  kids movie)! Gamera and Guiron battle on land, sea, and air on the alien  planet with the world hanging in the balance! Many funny bits in the film  such as... Gamera acting as a gymnest as he spins on parellel bars that  connect 2 buildings, as Zigra tries to fly away from Guiron, he jumps up  like 100 ft. in the air to cut Zigra in half, and more! This is where Dieti  Co. was running out of money and the series was reduced to this gem right  here. If you like films like ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" or  ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"".... this will be a real tresure for your  video collection.",964483200,,1248,4.141666666666667
7913140,3,B00000JQB2,"Very campy classic. Still a lot of fun. Even though this was a later entry in the series the quality of the production is good. Back in 1969, the steam was running out for the Kaiju genre. Even Toho studios began cutting  budgets on thier Godzilla movies. At least this film has mostly original  footage, where as the previous entry (Gamera vs. Viras) used lots of old  scenes, and even tinted black and white footage from the first Gamera  flick. The dubbing of the english language version is terrible. (thanks  Sandy) If you ever get a chance to see any of these films with the original  sound-track and english subtitles, you'll appreciate them more. It helps to  see it widescreen as well. Good old-fashioned fun.",957744000,,718,4.696
7913141,4,B00000JQB2,"I found this movie to be a lot of fun.  Gamera, the giant turtle who walks upright vs. a giant talking shark from another planet.  How can you possibly go wrong with that?  Throw in a way cool soundtrack, one of the  hottest looking women I've ever seen in a giant monster flick (Zigra's  earthling female servant), cool monster action, and funny, cheesy dubbed  dialogue and you have a movie that ranks right up there with Destroy All  Monsters and Godzilla vs. Monster Zero as one of my all-time favorite  Japanese monster flicks.  Personally, I would stay away from the MST3K  version.  If you need someone else to tell you what to find amusing about  this movie, go buy the new lame-assed American Godzilla movie and leave the  classics to those of us who really appreciate them.",953078400,6,783,4.627737226277373
