8497599,2,B004D4YE4W,"Contains the subtitled word sh*t 14 times, according to my 8-year old, who was delighted about that.  Since Amazon had this cartoon under ""children"" I didn't think to preview it.  Subtitles are pretty silly in general but the main problem is that the translator apparently thought ""sh*t"" was a mild expletive.  Not in my family.",1351641600,,328,4.927272727272728
8497600,1,B004D4YE4W,"I rented this to see if it might be something teachers could use in an Introduction to Chinese culture and Mandarin class.  The story is this:  HaoHao is a human boy hero who unfortunately mispronounces some words, which turns them into problems.  It's the stock Saturday morning cartoon plotline: Fun friends trying to save others are pursued by the henchmen of evil mastermind with super magical powers who have taken over a powerful institution and are controlling the leaders for their own evil purposes.  Despite its promising description, the movie isn't designed to instruct viewers by focusing on the elements of Chinese characters; there are only fleeting glimpses of the changes that Haohao makes to trasnform mis-written characters once a bottle of magical correction fluid is bestowed upon him and his trusty sidekicks--a floating sheet of paper, a blob of ink, and King Bily the fountain pen. I don't know any characters, but even if I did I'm sure I'd be fatigued by this repetitive movie.",1342742400,,1003,5.024096385542169
