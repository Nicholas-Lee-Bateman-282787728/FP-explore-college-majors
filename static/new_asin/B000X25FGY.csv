8226686,3,B000X25FGY,"OK early 70's Mexican-made Spanish-language (no sub-titles or dubbing) romance drama.  A terminally ill man kidnaps his former lover and a truck full of furs for a last fling/honeymoon.  He means no harm but his illness has deteriorated his better judgement.  His girl eventually comes around and decides to stay with him until the end.  My beefs are that whiny blaring trumpet he plays and his repeated yelling of her name: CLAUDIA, CLAUDIA, CLAUDIA.  The quality of the DVD is pretty good.  The quality of both the Nopal Films DVD release and the Videosuenos DVD release is pretty much equal.  Recommended for Julio Aleman fans.",1453680000,,630,4.942857142857143
