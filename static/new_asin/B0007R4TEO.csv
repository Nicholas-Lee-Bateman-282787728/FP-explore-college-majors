Great Extras too; Some crazy Music Charts and some pretty cool footage.",1138665600,,137,4.074074074074074
8050720,3,B0007R4TEO,"Careful, this is not a true DVD (Digital VIDEO Disc), but rather DVD-Music format, a 24-bit, 96 kHz, 6-channel sound experience.  The album is amazing, with fantastic arrangements, played inhumanly well, and recorded with great presence and detail.  I love the CD and was excited to get to see video of the great Big Phat Band in recording.  But this is not a DVD; all you get is a still picture slide show during the music.  If you have the means to decode the 6-channel audio, it will be better than the great CD.  If you can't decode the audio, skip this and buy the CD.  It gets 3 stars for not being a true DVD like Amazon calls it.  If it was a CD, it would get 5.",1122854400,5,670,4.147286821705427
8050721,1,B0007R4TEO,"I was feeling like a kid at Christmas when I found that the Big Phat Band had a dvd for Swingin' For The Fences.  The CD is a real favorite of mine and with all the new technology and the high-definition improvements available for video, I expected another awesome gem to add to my music library.  What I felt I got was a real rip-off.

Some may think the music carries the dvd, but my interpretation of a quality dvd is action to go with the music.  This collection of still photos as the music plays along is a joke.

I'd suggest Mr. Goodwin talk to the producer of Lee Ritenour's latest dvd release ""Overtime"" to find out how to put out a product that will give you goosebumps because of quality music and video together!

If I could have given this a lower rating, I would have in an instant!  If your thinking about getting this purchase, I suggest just get the cd - the music is awesome.  If you want still pictures, don't spend $25 for them.  Buy a good magazine!",1122508800,4,970,4.256830601092896
8050722,5,B0007R4TEO,"I purchased this disc because I heard Sing Sang Sung from a demo compilation at my local electronics store. Gordon states that he wanted to create an album which paid homage to the Big Band days using todays tech and inovations with you sitting in the middle of the band, and man I mean he nails it! The only down side is when I got to the end of the disc I just wanted more.

If your system has the capability to decode DTS, then stop the auto play and go to the main menu, system setup, select audio, and choose DTS. On my system there is a huge sound improvement over Dolby Digital for this disc.",1118361600,2,599,4.119658119658119
