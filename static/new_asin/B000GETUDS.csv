2605901,4,B000GETUDS,"Volume 3 of the BBC's ""Old Grey Whistle Test"" archival highlight series is a bit of an improvement over the previous installment (see my review of Vol. 2 on this site). I realize the choice of performance clips in any given collection  provides an endless catalyst for subjective argument-but let's just say that there are fewer ""turkeys"" in this outing! I still have some overall issues with these ""dumbed down"" U.S. versions, but until I'm ready to stop whingeing and spend a small fortune on the original British PAL releases, I guess this is what I (and my fellow hapless American consumers) are stuck with. As before, the breadth of the show's run is represented well, from early 70's to late 80's. Fans of British folk get a real treat this time out, with fine performances from Lindisfarne, Fairport Convention, Richard & Linda Thompson and John Martyn. One of the highlights for this reviewer is the clip of Johnny Winter really tearing up the house with his classic cover of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (I find the sight of a leaping, caped albino guitar virtuoso oddly reassuring). One very positive improvement over the previous volumes is on the technical side-someone at the BBC finally ""got"" it and gave us an a la carte option to select and play specific performances (should have been a no-brainer from day one!) By the way, I know the gentleman from Germantown was trying to be helpful, but his track listing is incorrect. Bowie, Brinsley Schwarz, Robin Trower, Al Stewart and Sade are NOT on this compilation.",1156896000,15,1520,4.823754789272031

8131061,1,B000GETUDS,"In the description for this, it lists Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe as ""actors,"" as though they're on it. But are they? No one mentions them in the reviews. Please let me know if they're on this, so I know whether to buy it or not. Thank you.",1294444800,,254,4.1

8131063,5,B000GETUDS,"I love the best of ""The Old Grey Whistle Test"" dvd series. That being said, it could have been an even better. Given the amount of excellent bands this show has presented, I believe the hosts chose too many ""flavor of the month"" bands, as evidenced by this particular disk's contents.

The PAL version of disk three has several excellent additions to it, namely David Bowie, Sade and Robin Trower. If you have a non-region dvd player or can convert this to NTSC, I'd recommend spending the extra money and get this version (and Volumes 1 & 2 as well.)

Any more volumes coming out in the near future? I'd buy them in an instant.",1237939200,,628,4.452173913043478
8131064,4,B000GETUDS,"you're obviously going to want this one as well.  I'm not only a fan of the performances, but also the format of the show as well as the intimate setting. (which as the presenters describe, was a matter of circumstance more than design)  The presenters themselves are extremely knowledgable about music and very well spoken without the hype that most Americans are used to when music performances and performers are being discussed.  Quiet, serious discourse on the songs and excellent performances.  I can't think of anything better.

One other thing, it's actually cheaper to buy these separately than in the box set which is very unusual.",1221350400,,641,5.009433962264151
8131065,1,B000GETUDS,"Unless you happen to be nostalgic for the self aggrandized commentary by former hosts and guests, I would suggest looking elsewhere.  As a fan of Volume One of this series (although not without its own faults) Volume 3 (and 2) are complete let downs that seem to bask in the embarrassment of lip synced performances - which unfortunately dominate this DVD.  The most obvious being Steppenwolf who clearly are using the original LP cut of ""Born to be Wild"" as a backing track.  Why do you want to pay money for a pretty tame and all around lame line-up that don't even play live?  As the DVD progresses chronologically, the format of the show gets more slick and even more unwatchable.",1187740800,,684,4.628099173553719
8131066,1,B000GETUDS,"Unbelievable! They did it again! As they did with volume 2 of this series the US version of this DVD has many artists REMOVED from the disc.

Last time around it was Be Bop Deluxe and Stanley Clarke they removed.

Now, as I predicted, they removed the great ROBIN TROWER!

What were they thinking?!!! Robin Trower was hugely succesful here and many of his fans would love to see his OGWT performances. I have his performance from the PAL disc and it is nothing less than stunning, it's the BEST performance on the disc!

Also omitted are David Bowie, Sade, Brinsley Schwarz, and Al Stewart.

WHY AREN'T WE GETTING THE FULL DISC THE SAME AS THE BRITS GET?!!!

The people who put out these discs are IDIOTS!

Meanwhile they left on performances, I won't name which, which have NO meaning to Americans and are not that great.

My suggestion is DON'T buy this disc and go to Amazon UK and buy the PAL version of this disc, the COMPLETE disc and see if your DVD player will play PAL DVD's of which some will.

This is ANOTHER botched DVD like Volume 2, as are The Allman Brothers-Great Woods, and Black Sabbath's-Last Supper with constant talking over the music.

BOOOOO!!!! SHAME!!!! You guys screwed up yet ANOTHER DVD which could have been great.

IDIOTS!!!

I won't give this ANY stars because they botched this so bad!",1158278400,74,1318,4.561702127659575
