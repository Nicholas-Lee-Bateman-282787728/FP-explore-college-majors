8556687,1,B00AQWXAJA,"This was horrible , i thought  it was going to be a great inspirational documentary that would inform  me  all about the bad o love to death, but no, what i got is some video made in someone's basement where all they did was copy and place  crap from  different  videos! And it was blurry and grainy  and was a crappy  bootleged power point made video. It made me weep tears of regrets and i wish i had never bought  such a low quality, repulsive thing. I am feeling personally  victimized by this crap! It got way to many good reviews that it never deserved! DON'T SUPPORT THIS RIPPED OFF PIECE OF CRAP!  I RATHER BE SUBJECTED TO 60 HOURS OF RICK ROLL THEN THIS GARBAGE.
Please  don't  waste money on this and end up disappointed  and broke.",1427760000,9,742,4.282608695652174

8556689,5,B00AQWXAJA,Great collection set. If you love fall out boy as much as me you will love this. Basically interviews them you really learn a lot.,1409097600,2,130,4.24
8556690,5,B00AQWXAJA,"The first DVD here is a pretty decent documentary film which tells the band's full story, but for me it is the second disc which makes the set a must. Containing numerous filmed interviews with the guys it really gets to the heart of what this awesome group believe in and stand for, as well as hearing from the horses mouth what they went through to get where they are today.",1390262400,,376,4.309859154929577
8556691,2,B00AQWXAJA,"Did not really like this. Commentary was a little hard to understand. Not really a fall out boy thing but someone else's point of view on them.,",1378080000,,144,4.37037037037037
8556692,4,B00AQWXAJA,it was good any fall out boy fan would like it but its not realy made by the band its other people talking about the band. it was a good movie any way,1376956800,6,150,3.5757575757575757
8556693,2,B00AQWXAJA,"I am a huge Fall Out Boy fan, and when I saw this, I knew I had to have it. I was so wrong. The first DVD is just a bunch of interviews I could have found on youtube. and they are terrible quality interviews at that. It is basically fan made and just not worth it. The second video also seems fan made. But they interviewed friends of FOB, as well as ""music enthusiasts"" which did not seem to know very much. All around this is not worth your money. Horrible quality videos and just not professional. I could have found better footage on youtube. Don't waste your money.",1372291200,,570,4.1909090909090905
8556694,2,B00AQWXAJA,"The first film is literally a highlight reel of Fall Out Boy interviews. You could put together your own version by scouring YouTube and cutting together a bunch of interviews with the band. That's what the film makers apparently did.

The second film is comprised of interviews with friends and acquaintances of the band from their early days in Chicago. It focuses on the formation of the band and stops after documenting the band's second (major) album, From Under the Cork Tree. In other words, it's old. I felt it was poorly put together also. With a running time of just over an hour, I felt like it was going on forever. It was just boring. I also found it odd that a film documenting Fall Out Boy didn't feature a single Fall Out Boy song. They played music in the background but it wasn't FOB.

As a big fan of Fall Out Boy, I was able to sit through the films even though I'll admit I was terribly bored. I can't imagine a casual fan would even be able to watch this. All in all this is a boring documentary that feels quickly, cheaply, and haphazardly put together. I was disappointed. Save your money and watch a few FOB interviews on YouTube. You'll get basically the same experience.",1372204800,8,1197,4.461187214611872
