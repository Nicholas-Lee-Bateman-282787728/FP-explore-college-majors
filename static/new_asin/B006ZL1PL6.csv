8507036,4,B006ZL1PL6,"There have been quite a few bundled sets of movies put on the market recently. Quite often, these packaged sets contain movies that rightfully failed at the box office. Sellers hope to make up in quantity what their bundles lack in quality.

However this packaged set of horror movies is different. It contains a preponderance of movies that would be individually worthwhile. This is one of the strongest sets of horror movies that I've seen, and one of the best values. I felt that at least six of the eight movies really offered something worth my time. Included here is:

""Mortuary"" - Notable for some of its quirky characters;
""Ritual"" - Some good on-screen presences, including the exotically beautiful Kristen Wilson;
""They"" - Richly atmospheric and eerie throughout;

""Six Degrees of Helter Skelter"" - A good trivia tour of the scenes of the Manson murders;
""The Hole"" - An intelligent study of a girl who would do anything for love - including THAT;
""The Nameless"" - a well-dubbed film about cultivating the ultimate evil.

For me, the two failures in this set were ""Children of the Corn III,"" a mish-mash of plot and gore - and ""The Crow: Wicked Prayed,"" a mish-mash of obscene violence.

But you're bound to find something to suit your scare tastes here. Just be aware there are no extras offered in this package. The movies are presented plain, without scene selection options, subtitles, or commentaries.",1346803200,3,1416,4.883333333333334
8507037,4,B006ZL1PL6,"I found this 2-disc collection thrown into the five-dollar bin at Walmart. The majority of the movies are from the old Miramax studio and now Echo Bridge is releasing some of their titles to DVD.

In this collection are Six Degrees of Helter Skelter, The Hole, The Nameless, The Crow: Wicked Prayer, Ritual, Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest, Mortuary, and Wes Craven Presents They.

The Helter Skelter is a documentary about the Manson Family Murders, in which I never plan to watch, as the subject just does not interest me.

The Nameless is a Spanish film from the same director of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darkness-Blu-ray/dp/B0080QOLG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darkness [Blu-ray</a>]. It is an interesting film, but for the most part, it is boring.

Children of the Corn III is the best of direct-to-video sequels. It is actually a scary movie, until the last twenty minutes when the studio must have ran out of money for the special effects.

Ritual is actually a Tales from the Crypt movie, but was shelved because of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Crypt-Presents-Bordello-Of-Blood/dp/B0000AOX0B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Crypt Presents - Bordello Of Blood</a>&nbsp;flopped at the box-office. It was released overseas in 2002 and it came out on DVD in the USA in 2006 under Tales from the Crypt Presents title, featuring a low-budget Crypt keeper intro. Ritual is also a remake of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Walked-with-a-Zombie-VHS/dp/B00004R72R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Walked with a Zombie [VHS</a>]. Jennifer Grey stars in this voodoo thriller, which is not that bad of a movie.

Mortuary is a creepy tale from director Todd Hooper about a mother, her teenage son, and her young daughter moving into a rundown mortuary that has a cemetery for a front yard. The plot involves, black ooze, zombies, a disfigured person, and just plain craziness. It is not Todd's best work, but I still like it for some weird reason.

Wes Craven Present's: They is a PG-13 horror movie about a group of adults that are being killed one by one by mysterious creatures that come out of dark. Considering it's not rated R, it is not that bad of a movie.

The Hole stars Thora Bitch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hocus-Pocus/dp/B004JMY312/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hocus Pocus</a>) and Kira Knightley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-Of-The-Caribbean-The-Curse-Of-The-Black-Pearl-Three-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B004DTLK6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>). I have never heard of the movie before buying this DVD, so it was the first movie that I watched. The plot involves four prep school kids being locked into an abandoned bomb shelter in England. It is not really a horror movie, but more of a thriller. Thora gives a great performance in it.

The Crow: Wicked Prayer stars Edward Furlong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day-Skynet-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B001RIY4WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]), David Boreanaz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-The-Complete-Series-Collector-s-Set/dp/B000TLTCU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel: The Complete Series (Collector's Set)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bones-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B000RO6JYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bones: The Complete Second Season</a>), and Dennis Hoffman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-2-The-Gruesome-Edition/dp/B000I2J68M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (The Gruesome Edition)</a>). One would think by the cast that the movie might be decent, but it is the worst in the series thanks to a bad script and overacting.

Despite a few not so great movies, the eight-movie pack is a steal at the price and I did enjoy several of the movies.",1343433600,4,4273,7.0301318267419965
