5915414,2,B00EIEPHBG,"Jason aldean is a pretty decent performer. that said, this concert is very hard to watch. it seems that when performers climb up the ladder of success they feel the need to show us, in every little detail, how they got there. there must be at least 12 interviews splced into the concert. the producers must think that the buyer of the dvd is only going to watch the dvd once. why would you ruin the flow and excitement of the concert with all these interviews. place these interviews in the bonus section after the concert. the second problem with this dvd is the filming of the concert. the camera is ALWAYS moving. the editing is so quick that it's very hard to watch the dvd. I was able to make it through about 15 minutes before turning it off. buy his first dvd. much better, in my opinion......",1382572800,14,800,4.375838926174497
5915415,5,B00EIEPHBG,"All the classics , wish it was on BLU RAY !!

Turn the lights out , crank up the surround sound and pretend you are there. As a die hard country fan, this is a must buy",1382400000,,168,3.5405405405405403
5915416,5,B00EIEPHBG,"they rocked it out!

only wished they would've put Texas was you in the setlist and played a 2 hour show..

best performer on the planet!

one quick note; am personally not a fan of storytelling in the middle of a concert..too choppy and breaks up the concert experience!

if I was going to edit this I would make it a bonus in the dvd bonus menu

WE WANT THE BLURAY OF THIS SHOW IN 5.1 AND PCM!!!!

think it's time for Jason and his boys to give us a full 2 hour concert... has a big enough catalog for those of us that want more than ""just the hits""...
i.e. Texas was you (which they played at the Bowl last Saturday night..thank you), If she could see me now, Do you wish it was me, Whose kissing you tonight, relentless...It ain't easy, I use what I got..these are my personal faves I wish he would put in rotation!",1382227200,8,819,4.119496855345912
5915417,5,B00EIEPHBG,"Jason Aldean made history by playing the first ever stadium show at UGA's Sanford stadium. He also cemented my respect for him as a performer. I've always been a fan of arena rock shows. I've seen Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, U2, and many others. This show ranks up there with the best of 'em. The video and audio are pristine here, and a must for an Aldean fan. Hell, any music fan. I just wish there was a blu-ray version available. Well worth your $12.",1381881600,4,458,4.337209302325581

5915431,2,B00EIEPHBG,Not a great concert by any means.  Very plain and boring performance.  The only positive were the interviews between songs....but that got old after about 10.  Not sure why he drew such a big crowd....I guess cause he grew up in Georgia.,1411344000,,237,4.595238095238095

5915436,5,B00EIEPHBG,"I attended the Night Train concert in Grand Rapids, MI, this DVD took me back to a phenominal show but also gave me an inside look behind the scenes at Jason's concerts as well as some fun things he does away from work. The man brings 110% percent to his shows, my favorite artist hands down!",1403049600,,292,4.232142857142857

5915442,5,B00EIEPHBG,I have been a bit of a Jason Aldean fan ever since I heard Crazy Town about 3 years ago. This music doesn't get much airplay here in New Zealand but I found it on a online country radio station and loved it. I found some more of his music online so when I  found this dvd I had to buy it. I'm glad I did!!.I know most of the songs and the video quality is brilliant. It's filmed like a documentary so it has interviews between some of the songs but that's because it's telling how he came to be in that place at that time so that doesn't bother me at all. It's interesting to find out things like that. The interview stuff is not boring at all. The concert footage is top notch. The music itself is awesome. JA is real showman and the fact that he cares about what his mother thinks is really great. She turns up to see how the set up for the show is going. I gave this 5 stars because I'm so impressed with the whole dvd. It's a must have for any JA fan. I really hope that sometime soon JA will grace our shores here for a concert tour.,1393545600,,1038,3.942857142857143
5915443,4,B00EIEPHBG,The visuals and recording are fantastic just bear in mind that some people will prefer to see the concert in full without the interviews dotted through. Personally that doesn't bother me and I think it is a very enjoyable performance.,1393200000,3,234,4.875
5915444,5,B00EIEPHBG,"Bottom line.......Jason Aldean is awesome!  I have seen his concerts come up over the years from the local bar in Chicago, to being the opener, to headlining his own sold-out tours.  Excellent,......excellent....excellent..",1392249600,,223,5.9375
5915445,4,B00EIEPHBG,"Loved it, very happy and Fair price.  I would recommend the item to any of the people I know for sure",1391644800,,101,3.8095238095238093
5915446,5,B00EIEPHBG,I did not think I was a fan of Jason Aldean but bought this because I was looking for concert videos.  I can't stop watching this.  I am now a big fan and am looking to buy some of his CDs.  I only own one now.  I am putting this live show on my bucket list now.,1390780800,,262,3.543859649122807
5915447,3,B00EIEPHBG,"Ok first thing I want to say this is a 5 star performance.  The interviews as others have said cost it a star for me.  I disagree with the complaints of quick cuts in editing.  I honestly think the quick cuts are used on songs that up paced and they work great.  The interviews are great first time around but they stink over time.  I figured I would just edit them out.  Well towards the end they totally butchered the beginning of songs with interviews.  WTF now I have to use creative editing to make it work.  Jason puts on a great performance and the editors just screw it up.  Yes the earlier concert video avoids these errors and is great, but so many great songs don't appear so just buying the other dvd is not a true solution.",1389916800,,736,4.237410071942446
5915448,4,B00EIEPHBG,"Jason has great songs and does a great job with concerts - I am sure - but watching this one made me think if I'd been there.. this would be my great memory of that one..
as i say, Jason does great songs.. and I appreciate all the backstory on this..
but I wasn't at the concert..",1389571200,,280,3.9298245614035086
5915449,5,B00EIEPHBG,"If you are a Jason Aldean fan, by all means buy this. It is a very good look at what happens on his tour and what happened during this particular concert, the only one ever held in this particular venue.",1389484800,,203,4.1
5915450,5,B00EIEPHBG,"If your a jason aldean fan you will love this, sang a lot of his great hits from the cd night train, had a lot of energy, he rocked live in concert and had kelly clarkson, and others, made it an excellent buy, purchase this, you will love this concert, a must have for jason aldean fans.",1388188800,,287,4.052631578947368
5915451,5,B00EIEPHBG,"This is great. It has interviews and things interspersed, so it's not a ""concert experience"", but it's fun to watch and to see Jason Aldean at Sanford Stadium is amazing!",1388102400,,170,4.7
5915452,5,B00EIEPHBG,This is sooo worth it.  We have his first concert DVD and that one is awesome as well.  Crank your surround and Grab a drink.,1386028800,,125,3.96
5915453,5,B00EIEPHBG,If you went to the concert during his current tour you are in for a treat.  This is well made and has some great background in the setting up of the tour.,1385856000,,154,3.8125
5915454,5,B00EIEPHBG,"My wife loves Jason, he could sing backwards and she would love it, it is a great show especially when Luke Bryan goes on stage with him, on my Sony 600 watt surround sound and my 70 inch Vizio smart TV....it was almost like going to a concert...glad the neighbors live far enough away not to mind. We cranked it up....especially on She's Country.....",1385424000,,351,4.5
5915455,5,B00EIEPHBG,Great DVD!!! It's just like being a  concert and you have the best seat in the house.  I watch this over and over again.,1384992000,,120,3.9583333333333335
5915456,1,B00EIEPHBG,"I am a very frequent Amazon customer. I am also a Prime member. However, in my excitement to buy this Jason Aldean product, I didn't realize it was a DVD. It was certainly not clear enough on the website page for me. Unfortunately, I've been too busy to actually sit down and watch it. When I buy music from Amazon it is with the intent to take it with me in the car, use it in the house, or take it with me when I travel. As a DVD, that becomes a bit more difficult.

Since I haven't watched the DVD I cannot comment on the content.

Sorry",1384819200,,540,3.990740740740741
5915457,5,B00EIEPHBG,"Shocked to see this concert video already available when the tour is still going strong (seeing Jason live in Dallas on 10/26/13) for an amazing tour. Seen the show twice already in Texas (and Dallas will be the third) to smaller venues than this stadium show from Georgia. Safe to say, Jason Aldean has hit the big time!
This DVD is a mere 84 minutes with music and interviews mixed together (each song is chapter indexed, so if you get tired of the ramblings...). Like one reviewer stated, the video is edited erratically. It does make you want to grab the motion sickness pills, but it is aimed at the right audience. The wild camera shots calm down beginning with ""The Truth"" (glad to see this on the set list) and the video becomes more watchable for us older folk.
The sound is the bland old Dolby Digital with very little in surround sound, but good bass. The sound could be better, but this is good enough. Maybe some of us love our hi def audio too much.
The video looks amazing on this DVD. I could see no color bleeding and the detail is really good. So you blu ray fans have nothing to worry about. Grab this version for under ten bucks and wait for a blu ray release sometime in the future (we only hope) with a lossless soundtrack. I am not familiar with the company who released this so I don't know if they even release blu rays.
My biggest complaint is the packaging. My copy is in a CD size case. Prefer the bigger DVD size case so it would fit better in my collection. But this is a minor quibble when the concert is well worth the bucks because this guy is amazing in concert! He just keeps getting better and better.",1382659200,4,1637,4.318181818181818
8605706,5,B00EIEPHBG,Very good concert. Clean and clear picture and sound. Turned up the sound bar and it sounded like jason aldean was in my living room. So far I've watched this about 5 times. Highly recommend,1531785600,,190,4.457142857142857
