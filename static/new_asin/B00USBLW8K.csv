7070892,3,B00USBLW8K,this movie was not the best but I still liked it for some reason. the camera was shaking the whole time like a hand held movie. even w2ith that I love dino movies and although this is not on my top 20 list I still enjoyed watching once. I would only recommend this too people who really love any kind of dino movie that can stand shaky cameras.,1432512000,2,344,4.073529411764706
7070893,1,B00USBLW8K,"The film opens with a written statement claiming this is real hand held footage, so it is not that good. The print is small, they really didn't want anyone to read it. A group goes to Peru to look for animals. We have the classic ""ground cam"" running and screaming, the classical tent scene ""what is that?"" as well as the camera man whispering to the camera with me catching about every third word. Add a rubber head dinosaur, and a guy who acts like Steve Irwin, and you have a fairly bad film.

One of the worst hand held camera films.  Recommend  Jill St. John in 1960  ""Lost World"" instead.

No sex or nudity. Didn't catch much in swearing.",1432339200,11,644,4.333333333333333
7070894,4,B00USBLW8K,"I thought that this movie was done well.  The dinos looked like dinosaurs, not paper toys.  The live action/CG mix was very good and with a good storyline , made for a rewarding viewing experience.",1436832000,,197,4.6
7070895,1,B00USBLW8K,"Not only 1 cover, but several different ones with the same picture, but different blurbs and different titles, like Extinction:Jurassic Predators and blurbs like "" **** Who needs JURASSIC WORLD when you have EXTINCTION'.'An UNRELENTING, UNSTOPPABLE THRILL RIDE"".

When I go into the DVD department at Walmart, sometimes an unfamiliar movie catches my eye, after all, who doesn't love dinosaurs, so I picked this one up - Biiiiiig Mistake! I should have learned my lesson by now because last year I picked up a copy of what is more or less, the exact same 'movie' - it was called The Dinosaur Project.

Both these movies are supposed to take place in some exotic location like the Amazon, however when you check out the scenery, there's no exotic animals to be found, it actually looks more like a nature trail that you would find in your local neighborhood. And both these 'movies' look like they could have been filmed in 2 or 3 days, basically  they are nature walks through wooded areas done with a hand held shaky camera.

Also there is NOTHING in either movie that looks like a DINOSAUR, roughly 3 - 5 minutes in total , quick and fuzzy shots of rubber toy props, usually in pitch black darkness, so you can barely see how cheaply made they are.

So this copy of Extinction is now sitting in my garage with all the other unwanted DVDs that retailers won't take as a resellable item. I was thinking of perhaps using my 'frisbee' throwing skills with this disc the next time I go for a nature walking hike in my local neighborhood trails.

Siskel and Ebert had a category for this type of 'movie' - it was called the BOMB of the week. Too bad Amazon doesn't have a similar type of Rating system! Shame on the makers and con artists of this type of movie,THEY ARE THE REAL PREDATORS, out to Cheat and Steal Money from unsuspecting customers with their false claims and  promises!",1435276800,5,1881,4.580357142857143
7070896,4,B00USBLW8K,"The success of a film like this depends as much on your expectations as the film. Being a monster born of the Blair Witch Project so long ago, 1999. you know it will have long stretches of nothing happening, and you will be lucky to see much of the monster, but should have realism beyond any 'fiction' film to compensate. And this one has the advantage the monsters were real, a long time ago....in a world where we live. In this film it would be inexcusable not to show the title monster. But I also had fairly high expectations, along with a willingness to go along for the ride.

The best feature was the high realism throughout of the characters and what happened, allowing for believability and actual tension, as well as the inevitable tedium.

Initially, real tension and fear is created with sounds. So, given this documentary-type film's realism, anticipation of the dinosaurs in this was different than any Jurassic Park. It was increased, because it was more real. So I anticipated that when the first dino appeared the reality would go bye bye. And though it threatened to at first, forgiveness is its own reward and the later encounters easily verged on utterly believable. Maybe my expectations included I really wanted to believe it. Yes, I wanted my belief to have the gravity of a real dinosaur, while my suspension of disbelief was lifted. The film did my job.

Even better for me was that it took me a long time to figure out how it was done. Maybe my desire to believe got the better of me. Which is what should happen in this sub-genre of found footage by having the maxim of maximum potential in most limitations. Was this CGI? It looked so solid. Was this a stroke of genius?

But later, two lines lifted from Jurassic Park disappointed me and took me out of this movie. Until I realised the filmmaker was not just taking; he was adding. He knew what he doing I think, because of the new contexts, or outcomes, he put them in. So he gave a couple of nods to the original best, while looking at it - in the other direction.

Unlike the other E film, or Ex film - Exists, a FFF about BigFoot - these creatures were done largely in the day, I'm thankful for. The filmmakers mostly took care to maximise them being believable. Likewise, the peoples' realism and fear was maintained, but also increased. Right til after the end and even beyond it. I for one would like to see the sequel!

On a final note, though this film, like all the others, did not fulfil the holy grave, err grail, of the horror of a dino actually eating a person how it would be, that Jurassic Disney Park should have done first, it may have come the closest a couple of times.",1435104000,2,2669,4.470225872689938
7070897,1,B00USBLW8K,"I had to send it back twice, have no idea if it is good or bad, it just would not play on any of my players, very disappointed and a waste of my time, Amazon was great on returning my money and shipping on both.",1435017600,,211,3.7111111111111112
7070898,1,B00USBLW8K,"The best thing about the ""dinosaurs"" in this film, is the picture on the DVD cover.

And honestly, the creators of ANY movie now being filmed with that shaky, Blair Witch, ONE-camera method, should be shot. This story should be renamed ""Blair Witch Dinos."" The script MIGHT have saved it  but the lines were delivered in whispered asides with mumbled British accents, so more than half of it was simply unintelligible. The ""dinosaurs"" were filmed mostly at night, at a distance, with any action taking place beyond thick trees  by a camera that was mostly falling down a hill or being tossed actor-to-actor. Infuriating. There couldn't have been much of a SPFX budget; every ""monster"" could've been either a hand-puppet, or one of those foot-high plastic dinosaurs now being sold by WalMart.

PLEASE don't waste money purchasing this travesty.",1434326400,6,843,5.043165467625899
7070899,3,B00USBLW8K,"Not a good write up, In Jurassic park 4 ""Extinction"" was a real flop.  Sam Neal states, ""That the part 4 show was a reboot"" never got

Ever see that video---maybe there's two---of the guy wearing the RAPTOR dino-suit, with the
animatronic-head, walking around a building's elevators?
THAT is as big as the dinosaur is in this movie. The ""big"" ones are only ""s=e=e=n"" from inside a
tent. The movie was starting to get old 80-minutes in, but, dammit, I paid my money.

I watched it once; won't watch it a second time.

A dinosaur movie where a tarantula, bug, and snake are scarier. The highlight of the F/X is the
terrific gash on the girl's belly!
The DVD case's COVER is the S-C-A-R-I-E-S-T part of this movie. Absolutely NO CGI-dinosaurs!
None.

Too LITTLE... and waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay TOO long!
I'm being VERY generous with TWO-stars, it'd probably top out at 1.5---on a, very, very, RAINY
day!

7070901,1,B00USBLW8K,"Spoiler Alert! This film is spoiled on so many levels the best thing I can say is Buyer Beware. The shameless profiteering of this group of film makers and marketers leaves this client disgusted. I knew this was not going to be solid competition for the latest Jurassic Park film. But I thought I would get SOMETHING for my money besides a flimsy cardboard cover and an even weaker movie within. Most of the running time of this film is spent watching hand held shots of people tramping through greenery , getting dirty, and gripping about how hot it is. The dinosaurs do not show up until the last few minutes of this meandering mess. And when they do, the props are recognizable as off-the-shelf plastic toys. I am not kidding. There is no bad language or nudity. But that does not mean that this has any entertainment value for younger viewers. This little gem is a dud for for any age group. You have been warned. There are more interesting DVDs coming out later this Summer. Save your money for a little while longer.  This dog will end up in a dollar bin before too long. Get it then if you must. That way you won't feel so ripped off.",1433894400,8,1141,4.407582938388626

7070903,1,B00USBLW8K,"This really is a poor film. I'm not a big fan of this kind of film - one where a shaky camera (Blair Witch style) records all the action, but I am a big dinosaur fan so I thought I would give it a go. Shaky camera as others reviewers have said doesn't quite hit the mark. Not only is the camera very shaky a majority of the time, but you get a lot of filming of the ground, scenes where people are talking and you're looking at their feet, and many minutes of dark screens (dark enough you can't really see any action). And there's very little ""face time"" with any dinosaurs. I was very disappointed and this DVD quickly found a spot in the trash can.",1433203200,11,651,4.09375
8708071,1,B00USBLW8K,"OK, first of all this is a 'found footage' movie, which isn't mentioned in the description.  I wish I had known before buying this DVD because I am SO over this particular film device.  Even beyond that, though, this movie is awful.  The character of the cameraman is a whiny twit who chatters and babbles throughout the entire film, so even when something interesting happens all you can think is ""Shut up, shut up, shut up!""  And, unfortunately, he's probably the most interesting character.  The movie was filmed in the UK and it's immediately obvious that they're not in a remote region of Amazonian Peru, and the believability of anything else in the movie goes downhill from there.  Did I mention that this movie is awful?  I only wish there was a way to rate it with no stars at all.",1534550400,,790,4.560283687943262
