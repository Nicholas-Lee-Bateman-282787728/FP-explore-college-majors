8100193,5,B000CQ2TKQ,"Art Adventures with Randy Sue is a how-to-draw program designed to help the viewer develop their drawing skills while feeling successful at the same time.

Kids of all ages easily follow along with the step by step process that utilizes the first method of learning to draw - contour drawing (drawing the outline of your subject only).

The first episode contains very easy things to draw to get the viewer used to the program and it's pace. The second episode shows more difficult subjects that challenge the viewer a bit more.

Each episode focuses on drawing only the outline of each subject. Once the viewer feels comfortable with contour drawing, they can then choose to color them in anyway they please.

Art Adventures with Randy Sue gently guides viewers of all ages through the steps needed to learn to draw and enables them to feel successful at the same time.",1284336000,,870,4.78
8100194,3,B000CQ2TKQ,"It would be helpful if the description of this DVD included the age of children it is geared toward. I purchased it for my 12 and 8 year old daughters. It is nicely done but WAAAY below their maturity level. She travels through a magic door to different places and teaches very elementary drawing skills. Which is fine and needed and it is done in a very sweet way. However, if I had gotten this information from the product description I would have chosen a different program for my children. I would show this to children ages 3 to 6 depending upon their maturity level and art skills and interest.  Both of my girls LOVE to paint and draw and spend a good bit of time doing these things. They are farther along in their artistic development than the lessons on this DVD. For example, the drawings she teaches are simple 2 dimensional drawings, nothing 3 dimensional or any shading at all. They are also much to old for the childish delivery. Again, there is NOTHING wrong with the delivery, it is just targeted to a much younger audience.

To be fair, we have not gone all the way to the end of the series because my girls were not learning anything new and lost interest. It is possible that the last lessons include more complex material. But even if they do the cute way the ""adventures"" take place are really better suited for younger children. For older kids this gets boring. They want to do more complex art instruction. For the younger set, this is a creative and fun way to encourage art and drawing. I wish I had discovered this DVD 6 years ago.",1260230400,4,1558,4.444055944055944
