1072680,5,630580740X,"This new DVD is an absoulutely stunning restoration of Argento's seminal giallo-horror film from 1975.  Not only is it in it's original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio (incredible), but it's also the complete uncut 126 minute  version.  The film has never looked or sounded so good.  The only slight  flaw is that under the end credits, the DVD freeze frames the image in the  puddle of blood which continued to move in the original film...why did they  do this?  Otherwise, it's a perfect presentation and includes the  italian and US trailers plus an interesting little featurette.  Since a  lot of scenes had been cut before the US release, many scenes in the film  suddenly pop up in italian with english subtitles.  This happens quite a  bit, even just small segments of scenes that were trimmed.  If the  constant change in language annoys you, however, you can always watch the  entire film in the italian version with english-subtitles throughout.  DEEP RED has a great reputation and although I think it showcases Argento  at his peak, it is also a Very leisurely-paced movie...it may tax the  patience of viewers more used to the fast-paced films of today.  In fact,  some scenes seem to go on way too long and the added extra romantic-comedy  bits between Hemmings and Nicolodi can be a little tiresome.  Also,  there's not as many plot twists as in Argento's other giallos like  ""Bird"", ""Four Flies"", ""Tenebre"",  ""Opera"" to keep the story very interesting... but as soon as  there's a murder scene....all is forgiven!  This movie has several GREAT  killing scenes, some very gory (which were edited in earlier prints) and  many of them inspired other films such as ""Halloween"" (check out  the the yarn needle scene) and ""Halloween 2"" (scalding water  scene).  The film also contains the first great collaboration score  between Goblin and Argento, a classic.  All in all, if you like Argento,  this is an absolute MUST purchase...the film looks like a multi-million  dollar production in this beautiful widescreen presentation.  Not my  favorite Argento by any means due to it's pace, but the pluses definitely  outweigh the minuses.  And you just gotta love that head splat scene!",956880000,2,2185,4.972144846796658
1072681,5,630580740X,"I saw this movie when I was about ten years old on a late night horror show, 1978 or 80, something like that, and have been dying-Absolutely DYING to see it again.  this is a great flick that is a melting pot of what we  would now call 'horror movie cliches, with a few surprises-even for the  modern slasher afficiando, haunted houses, psychics, imaginative murder  sequences (that haven't dated, not really) and a first class story that is  hard to find these days.  It is a Italian film though, and does have it's  quirks (by American film standards), which fortunately adds to the creepy  mystery of the story.  It's grand, but no surprise to see David Hemmings in  this film as it is only a further testament to the range of this fine  actor.  SEE it!  SEE it!  SEE it!",955411200,,774,4.435714285714286
1072682,4,630580740X,"Unlike many who have posted here, I HAVE seen the full 126minute version of Deep Red, on a badly copied conversion inpan-and-scan - and let me tell you, even in this form it was still one of the most exciting movies I think I've ever seen. Although a couple of decades of film has probably blunted the shock and gore elements, and all those character moments might make it seem slow, I promise you that this movie will freak you in ways few horror movies will.  Dario Argento's reputation rests entirely on this film and Suspiria, but this one is the superior.  All the best elements of his previous films are combined here - the protagonist who's seen something important he can't identify, killers with a fetish for black gloves, vague hints of the supernatural, gender transgression..... and of coursre the gore. Believe me, you'll think twice about checking the door locks after dark when you see what happens to Helga the psychic.  Argento was never this suspenseful again, probably because Mark (the protagonist), like the audience, knows he has to solve the mystery before the killer will ever leave him alone.  The DVD release of DEEP RED is a real event, and Goblin's score presented in Dolby Digital would be worth it all by itself!  I can't wait until release day...........",954892800,21,1285,4.77027027027027
1072683,5,630580740X,"""Deep Red"" is without a doubt Dario Argento's masterpiece.  With a very clear (for Argento) storyline, absolutely dazzling camerawork and an unforgettable score by Goblin (which is bound to sound incredible in 5.1),  ""Deep Red"" is a must for the horror aficionado, especially those  with an interest in films that are historically relevant.  ""Deep  Red"" is the ""Psycho"" of Italian cinema.  Back in 1975, when  it came out, graphic gore was mostly relegated to ultra low-budget movies  where carnage was the only point of the movie.  With ""Deep Red"",  Argento took gore in a completely new direction, mixing it with classy  cinematography and a complex story, and unleashing it upon unsuspecting  stars of the Italian stage and screen, people so prestigious in their own  way you would never expect them to get it the way they do in a movie.  The  uncut widescreen version of this film, which has been long overdue in  America, will reveal to those who have only seen it in pan-and-scan form  the artistry and complexity of Argento's Technovision images.  The  previously unreleased footage, which I have seen and which was truncated  from the version that has been in circulation in this country for decades,  adds depth to the characters and the story.  In my opinion, you should  preferably watch this in Italian with English subtitles -- the English  dubbing is atrocious and the Italian original is far more poetic-sounding  and apropriate to the story and, besides, Anchor Bay is releasing the added  footage in Italian because there is no English dub of those scenes, so you  might as well watch it all in its original language.  At any rate, this is  a must for everyone who appreciates good scary movies, for anyone with an  eye for truly spectacular filmmaking and especially for anyone who thinks  European movies means Truffaut.  An absolute must-have!",952300800,81,1863,4.96742671009772

Even if the music had been appropriate, I'm not sure this movie would have been worth much.  There's also completely out of place slapstick throughout that just makes no sense.  How could anyone thought it was a good idea to have an unfunny arm wrestling contest with a ""liberated woman"" shortly after the initial killing?  Why when those arm wrestling screwballs are later talking on the phone, is one of them getting blasted with a steamy coffee machine while the other shouts over a loud newsroom to ZERO comic effect?

1072947,5,630580740X,"After a mysterious clue at the beginning, Dario Argento's DEEP RED (1975) takes us to a theater, where a psychic named Helga Ulmann (Macha Meril) is demonstrating her mental abilities. Back at her apartment, she has no idea that her powers have led her into trouble of the lethal kind. Ironically, her visions are no help at all. Meanwhile, jazz pianist Marcus Daly (David Hemmings) is just outside, minding his own business. Suddenly, a scream, and Marcus is drawn into the drama, in a most... disturbing, blood-soaked way. Now a witness to murder, he believes he may have caught a glimpse of something odd, but can't quite figure out why it seems important. After meeting up w/ reporter Gianna Brezzi (Daria Nicolodi), Marcus sets out to solve the crime himself. This, of course, gets the attention of the killer, resulting in Marcus being stalked by the maniac! Then, he finds that all of this could possibly have something to do w/ a weird children's song, a spooky mansion, and an old legend. More deaths occur. Can Marcus figure it all out, before he too winds up dead? One of Argento's best giallo films, utilizing elements of the supernatural / paranormal, as well as the psychological. BEST PARTS / SCENES / ASPECTS OF THIS MOVIE: #1- The death of Helga. #2- That creepy doll / robot thing! #3- Any / every time Marcus goes to that glorious house! #4- The Goblin soundtrack!!!! #5- The truly surprising, final reveal!

1072949,4,630580740X,"A prime example of how superior direction can elevate a film to something greater than the sum of its parts. At its core, Deep Red plays with the same basic structure and themes as any other giallo film. But with Dario Argento at the helm, the familiar tropes rise to a new plane of vibrancy and vitality that few other directors in the genre are able to achieve. There's so much subtlety in the way Argento accomplishes this: the way he carefully stages and photographs his set pieces, the fluid movements of his camera, the Hitchcockian escalation of suspense, the occasionally bizarre and dream-like flourishes, the off-color use of music. Each plays a crucial role in breathing life into the film and differentiating it from the competition, and the result is a film which earns its reputation as one of the best in the genre. Unfortunately I do still have some nagging issues, mainly with the pacing and the length of the film. At times it does feel as if it could've been tightened up into a slightly more well-oiled machine. And of course there is some cheesiness and stilted acting here and there which is pretty much par for the course for the genre. But when the film is at its best, it is quite arresting and certainly offers some of the best thrills the genre has to offer. Definitely one I look forward to revisiting.

Sure it has some of the best murder scenes ever, as well as brilliant imagery; but the script is so poorly written and preposterous that the film seems to drag on interminably, only to come alive solely for the violence. The bits of awkward Italian comedy that do little to help us care about or even believe the characters just make things worse. You'd think if you were making a thriller with little concern for writing, pacing, acting or character development you'd avoid having endless scenes of dialogue!

This beloved production from Dario Argento, which is pretty much universally hailed as a masterpiece of giallo, went right by me.  I cant deny that there are many beautifully composed shots and some genuinely creepy images, but it suffers greatly in the areas of plot, pacing, and performance.  There are many, many tedious scenes of characters stalking through rooms and hallways, looking for something or dreading something, which is absolutely not suspenseful, especially when the jarring music of Italian rockers Goblin comes crashing in.  I won't write off giallo completely (I feel like I should still see Suspiria), but its not a well that I will be dipping into often.

1073359,5,630580740X,"Dario Argento's Deep Red is a thinking man's slasher movie. He has an

obvious flair for the dramatic, and his visual style is a lot more polished

than what you find in your typical slasher flick.

His overall theme is the loss of innocence. His characters have troubled

pasts, but his real subject is his setting, Rome. Life in this once great

city has become too complex and too confusing in modern times. It's noisy,

it's dirty, it's sleazy. The lead couple, played by David Hemmings and

Daria Nicolodi, argue about women's lib. Hemmings' best friend turns out to

be a homosexual, which seems to make him uncomfortable. A German Jewish

psychic is given a Jewish burial in Catholic Rome. And, of course, a mad

slasher is on the loose. All the while, ancient Roman statues loom in

Argento's backgrounds, underlining how much simpler and nobler life used to

be.

It might be chauvinistic to make comparisons between Argento's style and

Italian opera, but the comparison is unavoidable. His famous kill scenes

are meticulously and beautifully staged. You never really notice how grisly

some of them are because they're so elegant.

I'm watching the Blue Underground release of this movie. It looks pretty

good to me. Details are sharp, colors are rich. Some of the sound recording

in the first few minutes is still sub-par, but once past the opening mind-

reading scene, the dubbed English soundtrack is entirely acceptable. As far

as I can tell, this release is the complete version of Deep Red. It's not

the butchered US version called The Hatchet Murders. (I know because I'm

sorry to say I own the lousy US version, too.)

The Goblin soundtrack sounds absolutely great on this release. This weird

fusion music is just as bizarre and original now as it was in 1975. You can

tell that John Carpenter probably had this music in mind when he scored his

own classic slasher flick Halloween a few years later.

The plot's a little flimsy, and I have to say that the inexperienced

actress Daria Nicolodi wasn't quite ready to handle a major role at this

point in her career. Other than those quibbles, Deep Red is clearly a

classic horror film that deserves a place on any DVD collector's top shelf.",1419292800,,2220,4.748031496062992

Picture quality is good for a film this old. Every now and then I felt like the film grain was ""flashing"" for lack of a better term, but it was not very often.

As far as audio goes I found it equally as pleasing as the video. Goblin's soundtrack sounded great as well as sound effects and dialogue, in both the English and Italian versions

The special features are definitely the worst part of the disc. There is one interview with Argento and the producers/writers that is about 15 minutes long, then two boring music videos: one by the present-day Goblin in what appears to be someone's home studio, and another made probably in the 90s/early 00s by a band I'd never heard of that features some pretty awful special effects.

1073368,5,630580740X,"I'm a fan of Dario's films, different to the American horror films
but i like both Italian and American horror
you can tell in the killing scenes in Dario's films that he likes to do close up shots of the Kills
so you can understand how Italian horror is more Graphic than American Horror
but unfortunately the story/screenplay in His films are weak thou
but that's Italian horror, the killing scenes are very Graphic, but the story/screenplay of his films can be weak
and Deep red is no exception, the Acting is Good-very Good but the screenplay is 50% weak 50% strong

the original Anchor bay release only had the Italian Directors cut version that runs for 126mins UNRATED
i have the Anchor bay release, i bought it years ago before this blu-ray was released
the film is very frustrating to watch cause some scenes are in English and some are in Italian with English subtitles
so the language barrier switches back and forth during the film  which is very frustrating to the point
i coudn't watch it all the way through cause it was annoying with the language barrier
English subtitles are tolerable you can either put up with it and try watching the whole film or don't bother watching it.

this Blu-ray release by Blue underground is much better than the Anchor bay release
cause for the first time ever the entire English version is released now to the public on Blu-ray
both the NOT RATED English version and the Italian Directors cut are both on 1 Blu-ray Disc for the first time ever
the English version is about 105mins long, some of the Italian actors have been dubbed in English really well
to the point that i can't really tell.
the Italian version is 126mins long
the blu-ray cover art has chapter selections for both versions
the Italian version is about 23 chapters and the English version is about 19 chapters
so there are some scenes missing from the English version that are only in the Italian version
check the chapter selection and compare yourself
the Italian version has English subtitles anyway so watch the Italian version if you're a mad fan
otherwise the English version is fine with me
i have watched some scenes from both and both versions have been given full HD transfers
in a brand new 7.1 surround sound so you're definitely getting the best of both versions.

there are no new extras at all, you get the same extras as from the Anchor bay release
10mins interview with Dario argento and some other crew, it's the same featurette from the Anchor bay release
so nothing new there
but you get both versions on 1 blu-ray Disc with all new HD transfers
the English version is only available on this blu-ray along with the Italian version
so better off buying this blu-ray version and scrapping the old Anchor bay release
definitely time for an upgrade and get the new blu-ray version.
definitely worth the money for sure.",1389484800,6,2851,4.650793650793651

1073515,5,630580740X,"Deep Red is an Italian horror film from the mid seventies, it's considered a classic in the genre and with good reason. It tells the story of a pianist who becomes involved in the investigation of a murder committed by a masked killer.

In many ways the film shows it age, the acting is overly dramatic, the effects obvious (although no more so than some of the CG effects in recent films), but it does have a number of traits that stand the test of time. The first is the story, it is well paced and unfurls in an interesting direction.

The humour in the film also adds to the entertainment, it intersperses the strangeness and the horror of what is going on. For its time it's also quite gory and the effects must have been quite shocking. Like most good horror films it doesn't rely on shock and gore to make its point, there are a few creepy moments.

I mentioned strange and as well as creepiness the film has its surreal moments too. These use tricks familiar to us now, but again were novel for their time. All in all this is still a fun film to watch and also provides some good instruction in how a good horror can work.",1380931200,,1130,4.295774647887324

The plot plods along with beleaguered pace and lack of suspense. Half way through the movie you only have two suspects (surprise at the end, but you are glad it is over) and when the twist at the end that makes no sense. The murderer has no motivation to do what they did and the back story that is revealed offers no logical explanation besides they were ""crazy"".

1073517,3,630580740X,"I LOVED another person's review on here that was entitled ""Deep Sleep.""  Such is almost the case with Dario Argento's ""Deep Red.""  Originally released in a cut-to-pieces-form, this is supposedly the complete uncut English version (although different languages appear and disappear throughout the movie; there's German, Italian, and [really] the English is dubbed).  Dubbed movies usually bother me; I prefer subtitles.  But I digress.

I have found with many of Argento's movies, you either love them or hate them--there is no middle ground.  ""Deep Red"" spins a demented tale (Argento is known for that) about murder, secrets, and all things sinister.  Argento also managed to cast the most BORING lead for the man (David Hemmings) who poorly portrays a pianist who happens to witness a murder.  I guess in Italy the police are not so concerned about regular Joes meddling into their investigations because Hemmings is ALWAYS meddling into something...and is ALWAYS about 10 minutes behind the killer.  Pacing is extremely slow and the gore effects very amateur.

The words ""masterpiece,"" ""best,"" ""horrific,"" etc. have been tossed around in many other reviews.  Frankly, I just don't see it.  The only Argento movie I ever enjoyed (and I think it was BY FAR his best) was ""Suspiria.""  ""Deep Red"" is just your usual Italian attempt at horror and something that would play at a drive-in.

I re-watched this film tonight (1-19-2013), some 37 years after it's original release, and experienced the same sensory overload as the first time I watched it. While the special effects and acting technique are quite obviously dated, the other elements of the film, namely the cinematography and the music, remain as relevant as ever.

The score for this film is pure genius. It is in the realm of classic Hitchcock in the way it helps to frame and accentuate the film's suspense. At the same time it is completely modern for it's era, and perhaps for any era, drawing on an eclectic mix of classical, disco and heavy metal sounds.

The film's direction under Argento is simply stunning. What Argento perfected, in this film more than any other, is the art of filming dark and horrific material in visually artistic and dramatic ways. The mind knows that these two are not supposed to go together, yet the senses seem to enjoy the results. The first time I watched this film, I kept wondering the whole way through if it was supposed to be a serious effort at horror or not. It has a lot of humor in it, and has some scenes that at first seem to be completely arbitrary. When it was over, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it.

1073642,4,630580740X,"With a more straight ahead narrative style, and few quirky plot detours, Deep Red (1975) is generally regarded as one of Dario Argento's better efforts.  The film marks the director's first collaboration with the musical group Goblin, who provide the first of what would be many eerie, powerful, and atmospheric soundtracks.  Characteristic for a giallo, Deep Red contains some stylish and unusual kills by a gloved killer, creative cinematography, oddball characters including a creepy kid, weird behavior by an animal, and some red herrings that lead to a surprise ending.  Co-written with Bernardo Zapponi, who had also collaborated with Federico Fellini, the story has few supernatural elements, and is more of a detective mystery, with flashes of unexpected violence.

At a conference being held in a theater, psychic Helga Ulmann (Macha Meril) pronounces that someone in the audience is a killer, who will soon kill again.  The eerie prediction comes true that very night, when Ulmann is attacked in her apartment, and hacked with a cleaver.  After speaking to his friend Carlo (Gabriele Lavia), pianist Marcus Daly (David Hemmings) is on his way home, when he observes Ulmann, who lives in the apartment below his, being attacked at her window.  Daly rushes to her aid, but is too late to prevent her death.

Troubled by something that he thinks he has seen, Daly begins to investigate.  His sudden partnership with reporter Gianna Brezzi (Daria Nicolodi) is odd, but not really too unusual for a giallo.  Daly follows up a lead, and discovers the grisly murder of an author, and then proceeds to investigate a spooky abandoned house, with a dark mysterious past. The danger increases as Daly gets closer to the truth, as he barely escapes being burned alive.  Gianna isn't so lucky, as she is attacked, but it seems that matters may be resolved, as while fleeing from the police, the attacker gets his skull crushed.  Daly however, keeps using his brain, and finds himself in one last deadly encounter, where his quick action finally brings the case to a sudden conclusion.

Deep Red features some slightly weird characters, odd plot developments, and a few lapses in logic, but it still seems to hold together fairly well, and is more grounded in reality than some of Argento's previous giallo, and his supernatural thrillers like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B0041KW7T2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>&nbsp;(1977) and Phenomenon (1985), that would follow.  The goofy elements, including some oddly behaved birds, a creepy little girl, and a robotic doll, are fairly tame for an Argento film.  With nothing but time on his hands, Daly is a driven although rather bland protagonist, who operates mostly on his own, as Gianna isn't very involved, until the very end.

While there aren't that many obvious suspects, the plot moves along briskly, continually adding creepy elements, keeping you engaged, while providing few clues as to where things may be going.  Goblin's music is nicely integrated into the film to enhance the atmosphere, add pace, and accentuate the tension.  This aspect would soon become a trademark of Argento's films, as he continued to collaborate with these talented musicians.  The acting is probably better than average for an Italian production, and the English dialog seems less clumsy than what you usually find in a giallo.

Many familiar with Argento recommend Deep Red as an introduction to his work.  As one of his more straightforward and focused efforts, this would seem to be sound advice.  The director had clearly found his stride, and was entering the phase in his career that would elevate him to status as one of the masters of horror during the 1970's and 80's.  Deep Red is available in various versions, with the 2011 uncensored English version by Blue Underground, available in both DVD and Bluray.

1073646,3,630580740X,"TO AVOID CONFUSION: This review concerns the 2011 DVD release, not the Blu-Ray.

But confusion is inevitable here: why, in 2011, would a publisher choose to release one of an iconic director's most influential films with twenty minutes missing?  Ignore that misleading ""Uncensored English version!"" tagline; yes, the gore's intact  -  but the story ain't.  Scenes AWOL off the top of my head:

- Marcus's piano classes;
- parts of Marcus's interviews with the police, where he's nervously defending his supposedly effeminate profession;
- Gianna's confession of how her confident exterior hides a nervous loneliness, and much of her screen time in general;
- the explanation as to the presence of the children's song that precedes each murder;
- oh, and you know that message that one of the victims leaves about the killer's identity?  Blue Underground's commitment to English or bust meant they decided to leave it untranslated & unsubtitled.  Too bad for you if you don't speak Italian!

A watchful eye might note that most of the scenes cut concern the movie's theme of how those who don't fit neatly into their assigned gender roles feel lost and insecure in society.  It's almost as if someone were gutting the film's ideas in an attempt to make it just a slick and streamlined thriller, to get an Argento film to make narrative _sense,_ and HA HA HA HA HA good luck with that, buddy.  10,000 suspiciously-similar reviews state that the edit is dandy and that the movie never _needed_ those extra scenes, anyway, but  -  well, why didn't they just include BOTH versions and let us decide for ourselves?

Now, the transfer of what movie survived _looks_ just great, as is most evident in the lush red of the psychic interview that opens the plot.  The DVD contains a few extras, nothing exciting  -  a couple music videos from Goblin and prog rock group Daemonica (ho-hum, but points to Daemonica for the tribute effort), a short featurette with Argento carping about the usual insults of which artists perceive themselves victims (guess he can add new grievance on the pile).

I dunno; I just thought we were past all this, the idea that releasing movies in chopped-up edits is OK if they're made by foreign people with funny names.  My compatriots insist that the gore's all that matters, but if that were true, we'd all just content ourselves with ""Faces of Death Part 35,"" wouldn't we?

From what I hear on other reviews in the past, this is the version of the movie to buy, but since I,m very picky with what I buy, I'm now looking for the movie with the original end titles.

For those who don't know what I'm talking about, most US versions of the film that are uncut still show an altered ending where Marco is looking at a pool of blood. You can argue that its not an altered ending, but the difference is that in the theatricl version, Marco changes expressions when he's looking at the blood, while the altered ending is a freeze frame of Marco looking at the blood with a blank expression.

1073732,5,630580740X,"After reading a few negative reviews of this release, I'm just throwing my two cents in.  I should point out that I'm a huge Argento fan (one of my all time favorite directors) and that unlike some people I've been very pleased with every single Argento-Blue Underground release.

First off, I've watched both versions of the film on this bluray disk, the picture quality is very good.  I was slightly disappointed that it didn't make a major leap forward from the old DVDs like I experienced when first watching the blurays of Stendhal Syndrome or Inferno, but I pulled out my old Anchor Bay DVD (the one mentioned by the other reviewer) and watched the first 10 minutes of the DVD vs the Bluray back to back and the bluray is substantially better picture quality wise(don't get me wrong the PQ is very good on this release just with some of the others it felt like I was seeing the film for the first time).

Next since I've seen the uncut Italian version countless times, I was looking forward to finally seeing a quality release of the Uncut English version.  I can confirm that as best as I can tell all the gore in intact.  The things which seem to be cut are some of the Hemmings pianist scenes. I can see how people feel either way on this, it does make the pacing of the film slightly faster, but I think it you lose some character development.  After seeing this, personally I still prefer the 126 minute version.

As for the dvd having only the uncut english version, as someone else pointed out Blue Underground a couple of years ago released the Uncut Italian version already on DVD.  Just get the other edition, or move up to the bluray.

Having seen the Italian version many times, I was pretty excited to get to watch it with full Italian audio and English subs.  I may be mistaken but I don't remember this being present on the Anchor Bay DVD, if memory serves me correctly only a few parts in old Italian version had subs.  Watching the entire film in Italian did give a slightly different feel to it, which I quite liked (I realize that Hemmings was speaking English and was dubbed into Italian).

The most disappointing part to me (as another reviewer mentioned) are the extras, the two Goblin videos weren't very interesting and I've already seen the very short Argento interview.  I'm not too disappointed though, because I'd gladly take two versions of the film over any sort of extras.  Overall I'm very pleased with this version from Blue Underground and look forward to more of their Argento releases.",1306368000,29,2527,4.572062084257206
1073733,5,630580740X,"I think most people buying this are already familiar with the movie so I'm just going to discuss the blu ray specifically.

I'm not sure what the other reviewer, David Smith, was talking about with regard to the DVD transfer from Anchor Bay being superior to this release.  That is insane!  This looks fantastic and is definitely the best the film has ever looked in any form of video release.  Don't believe me?  Then check these sources:  blu-ray.com, mondo-digital.com, and 10Kbullets.com which all give rave reviews to the transfer and overall quality of this release.

And reviewer ""Satisfied Reader"" is completely incorrect when he stated that this is a ""cut/edited"" version of the movie (as has already been pointed out by someone else).  This blu-ray has both the 105 minute English and the 126 minute Italian versions of the film.  If that's not enough you can watch the Italian version in English with English subtitles that will come up on scenes that did not have English audio (the same audio design that the Anchor Bay dvd had).  It can be a bit jarring bouncing from English to Italian w/ subtitles but very cool that this is included for those used to watching the old Anchor Bay dvd.

The only weak point, if there is one, is that Blue Underground didn't add any NEW extras.  But that is a really minor gripe.  They did port over the extras from the Anchor Bay dvd.  The video and audio are superb!  An overall ""A"" for this release.  If you are a fan, you will not regret buying this...especially at this price!

EDIT:  reviewer David T. pointed out to me the Goblin videos are actually a new feature.  I double-checked my Anchor Bay DVD and sure enough not there.  Of course, the 2010 year by the feature on the back of the blu-ray should have been a give-away.  Whoops, I missed that.  So, hey even better!  Even though the videos didn't really do much for me, it is pretty cool that they put them on there.",1306281600,6,1926,4.567251461988304

I own every release on DVD and now BLU.  I still have some tapes and laserdiscs as well.  Boy was I disappointed.  Not with the content, but with the picture.  It was horrible in comparison to the previous Anchor Bay DVD release.  Yes, it was a bit sharper, but the digital noise was off the charts.  It looked as though the print was left out in the sun or something.  White specks everywhere.  The DVD does have a softer look to it, but it is preferable with regard to color.  This was not an enjoyable experience.  I now dread opening the other Blue Underground titles that I have sitting on the shelf.  If they are the same, they are going on eBay and I am cancelling future Aregento releases.  Again, I absolutely LOVE this film and count it among my personal favorites.

It look better than I've ever seen it, and I've seen it in just about every format it was released in including theatrical screenings.  There are nitpicks involving slight, inconsistent color variations, but they are light, few and far between and don't detract.  It's such a visually beautiful film and the impressive transfer reflects that.

Extras.  The commentary track by Argento expert named Thomas Rostock is really good, and the main reason that I opted for this instead of waiting for the Blue Underground release.  I love commentary tracks and this one is well researched and filled with sharp details about the film's history and symbolism.

Unfortunately, the three featurettes are rather slack with much of the running time devoted to film clips.

Both the international and U.S. trailers are included.

The menus look good and are easy to navigate.

The packaging is very nice with a short, well-done booklet of liner notes, reversible covers, and dual-sided mini-poster.

1073737,5,630580740X,"It resonates with all the visual excesses and subliminal undercurrents that Argento would later explore to their maximum capacity. It is a tour de force of camera, composition, and film craft skills. It is such a benchmark of smart, passionate film construction that it surpasses expectations and thwarts potential imitations. It's interesting to note that even when Argento presently returns to the giallo style thriller to keep his name in the genre, the films (Tenebrae, Non Ho Sonno, Opera) all resemble pale imitations of Deep Red. In his rethinking of the psycho killer genre, he focuses less on the killer and more on the climate of fear. He wants the threat to come from the unknown, not some clear-cut origin. Because Argento is one of only a handful of horror directors who appreciates and uses the apprehension of the unfamiliar to provide mood for his movies and motivation for audience dread, his films are viewed as disturbing and uncomfortable. But this does not mean they are unsuccessful. Indeed, Deep Red is a terrific thriller.

Argento makes several conceptual deviations that cause Deep Red to stand out. First was the idea of creating isolated vignettes, moments in screen time that would not be explained and simply left for the audience to mull over and formulate their own narrative associations. Argento employs this device from the very beginning of the film. As the credits roll and the wonderful score by Goblin begins to throb like the thrillers engine in idle, we wait for the story to motor out of the starting gate. But then Argento turns down the rock and introduces a nursery rhyme style music box melody, and our first vignette plays out. It is Christmas, and in the shadows near the tree, we see a struggle and a stabbing. A scream echoes across the soundtrack and then a huge knife plunges to the floor. As it rests there, the music continues its cheerful childishness and then, a pair of highly glossed juvenile shoes appear, standing over the knife in a shot so exquisite it's like witnessing the birth of a masterwork by a celebrated painter. Before it all registers, we are back to black and the rock throb of the score. The rest of the credits play, and the movie proper begins.

Along with breaking convention (the second major deviation to discuss), this immediate interruption of the flow of the film shows that Argento is ready to throw out the standard cinematic guidebook on narrative drive and cohesion and begin his journey into the unexplained. A series of questions arise from the opening moments, questions that will not have answers given to them for a long time, if at all. What did we see? Who had the knife? Is someone hurt? Dead? Why is there a child there? Did the child see it? Did the child do it? Argento uses these questions to begin the process of cinematic prestidigitation of creating a story where everything and nothing is important, all things and only a few things have meaning, and each new scene or character will provide more issues than their presence or dialogue will answer. By building layers of inquiry, Argento is creating substrata in his storyline and the characterization. He is also sewing the seed of suspense. Bit by bit he intends to address everything that he will show onscreen, but he is not about to make the connections or explanations easy. The audience has come along for the ride, and they have to do some work in order to get the most out of Deep Red.",1301616000,9,3447,4.762541806020067
1073738,5,630580740X,"It's clear from reading the reviews of this movie on Amazon that people either ""get"" Dario Argento or they do not.  It's an either/or type of thing.  I'm not sure why that is the case, but I must count myself among the many who ""get"" him.  I don't bother trying to convert the non-believers because, well, they're non-believers!

That's not to say that every movie that Dario Argento has made is great.  Far from it - some have been real bombs.  But make no mistake - Deep Red is a masterpiece.  I've watched this movie many times and I still find it fascinating.  I can't say that for a lot of movies, regardless of genre.  A very few, yes; most, no.  This one, always.

I think one reason why I personally love Deep Red is because I understand that films in general do not exist in a vacuum.  They always reflect the times in which they were made - and the really good ones change the way films are made after them.  I find so many reviewers here on Amazon approach films as if they were all made in the last year, judge them accordingly, and find the older ones wanting.  Deep Red was made in 1975, not 2011, and is not an expensive bit of contemporary CGI schlock.  If you have an appreciation of the history of film, you'll see things in Deep Red that radically changed the concept of what a movie is and what a movie can be.  The impact of Deep Red on subsequent movie making - and viewing - is beyond the scope of this tidy little Amazon context.  Let me just say here that it did.  If you can't see that, well too bad for you!

1073865,5,630580740X,"""Deep Red,"" if nothing else, serves a reminder that horror films were once considered art and were made by people who actually knew what they were doing. The film is directed by Dario Argento, a celebrated director of Italian horror films. I'm no aficionado on Argento and this film serves as my introduction to his material. What we have here is not only a horror film that will inspire lovers of that genre, but a horror film that can be appreciated by those who enjoys the art of movies as well. Argento knows how to direct and he has a distinct visual flourish that makes this film the sort of pseudo-horror equivalent to the film ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" certainly in the sense that it's style influenced many later horror films in the way ""2001"" did with science-fiction. Released in 1975, this film has been largely influential with both its style and technique; and many shots in the film seem like mirror images of later films in the genre.

Before the opening credits finish rolling, there is a brilliant shot of two shadows appearing to be in a violent scuffle before a bloody knife falls to the floor. This scene sets up the visual tone of the rest of the film and instantly grabs your attention.

The film's plot is relatively familiar, with a protagonist that does everything the police should be doing and does it better than if the police were doing it. The protagonist of this story is Marc Daly, an English jazz pianist living in Italy. One night, from the street below, he witnesses the murder of his neighbor Helga Ulman, a clairvoyant. Due to a mysterious painting he know he saw in the woman's apartment that disappears moments later, Marc is drawn to investigate the murder with the help of persistent reporter Gianna (Daria Nicolodi, who plays the role in a way so that we're never really sure about her).
Of course, along the way, Marc risks his life tracking the killer while more bodies pile up. You've all seen a horror film.

The film's script (by Argento and Bernardo Zapponi) in the hands of a lesser director could've been a tedious bore. This script in the hands of most horror-film directors would've been a tedious bore. Argento is smarter than that though. He knows that it's atmosphere and suspense that make a great horror film, not just gratuitous violence and nudity. ""Deep red"" has plenty of violence, blood, and gore...But it also has style.

One of the most brilliant examples of great horror filmmaking is a scene in which a woman is drowned in a bathtub filled with boiling hot water. This scene is horrifying despite little gore and blood. Argento relies on editing, music, and cinematography to build suspense that leads to a horrifying payoff.

The musical score of the film, composed by Giorgio Gaslini and the band Goblin, is unusual for the genre but fits the material perfectly and punctuates every scene with the exact tone needed. Although, parts of the score are reminiscent of the original ""Halloween"" film (released three years later).

Creative editing techniques and wonderful cinematography are also what contribute to this film's greatness. Much like Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" it's a horror-film that has many of the ingredients of most panned horror films but is photographed and edited by people who know what they're doing...And visually, ""Deep Red"" is fascinating and quite possibly the high point of this film. It's cinematography that is so memorable and so noticeably good that people who don't know anything about cinematography will say ""this film has great cinematography."" The key ingredient that the average horror film of today is missing is talented filmmakers which Argento, cinematographer Luigi Kuveiller, and editor Franco Fraticelli are. The juxtaposition of the inspired directing, memorable cinematography, creative editing, and unique musical score all contribute to the film's greatest appeal. Unlike many films of this genre that age overnight (remember this year's remake of ""Friday the 13th"" that dropped from #1 at the Box office to not even in the top ten two weeks later), these things give ""Deep Red"" a timeless quality.

If more horror films were made this way, horror could actually gain some respectability...Unfortunately in the thirty-four years since this film was released, this genre has turned into an outlet for untalented filmmakers to produce their unoriginal, predictable drivel.

Now for the ending...The ending of this film is neither predictable nor entirely surprising. It works however, because it's these last five minutes of ""Deep Red"" where Argento concludes his film with a summary of why it's so great...The juxtaposition of an inventive death, terrific photography, and the recurring children's song theme that makes an ending that could've been nothing special wonderful.

I will specifically let prospective buyers know what they will get with this Synergy Entertainment release.  The truth is, you won't get very much at all.

First of all, what you get is actually a DVD-R, not a factory pressed DVD.  There is no menu screen, period.  There is not even a scene selection option.  It appears the film transfer comes directly from the negatives.  However, it also looks digitalized (as if it was downloaded and burned).  The running time clocks in at 2hr, 6min which seems to be the film in its entirety (uncut).

I would gladly shell out $2 or $3, but $10 (+ shipping) is far too much.  Anchor Bay really needs to do this essential giallo film some justice.",1234051200,7,995,4.4972067039106145

Amazon's database is screwed up on this movie, mixing up the 2 films.

Second, the original Halloween was better than this junk! Argento's movie looks and feels like his first film after film school. Slasher movies must just be lost on me, if this thing is someone's ""masterpiece"". Parts of it are more comedy than suspense.

You can really tell that this movie was made in the mid-70's.",1231718400,3,681,4.714285714285714
1074040,4,630580740X,"Dario Argento has been called many things, among of which is the ""Hitchcock"" of Italian cinema. The man has been responsible for many `trippy' journeys to the macabre and the supernatural. His finest works have arguably been ""Tenebre"", ""Suspiria"", and ""Inferno"". DEEP RED (1975) is one of Argento's finest work, the film is methodical, relies on restrained suspense and it even pushes the envelope in blood and gore during this period of time.

The film begins with a flashback of an off-screen murder, then the film moves forward in time to an auditorium with a psychic as the focus of the forum. The woman starts to freak out and yells weird convoluted stuff to the audience. That same evening, a piano teacher named Marcus Daly (David Hemmings) witnesses the same psychic being ""hatched"" to death by her window. He rushes to the aid of his neighbor. For some reason, Marcus motivated to investigate this savage murder and a tenacious reporter named Gianna (Daria Nicolodi) joins him on his quest. The pair goes on to investigate a series of bizarre clues and brutal violence that will find them both in a situation more than they had bargained for.

Dario Argento definitely knew how to work his audience in this film. The man knows how to choose his shots and utilizes the widescreen frame to its utmost. Camera pans, extreme close ups, lingering shots and reverse zooms--further accentuated by his use of ominous lighting and grim atmosphere. ""Deep Red"" displays as to why Argento had become a legend among aspiring filmmakers, this is Dario Argento in his prime, and he shows that he has a remarkable feel for suspense.

The film focuses on the murder investigation rather than an abundance of blood and gore. Many would question as to how and why a simple pianist could have the skill of a seasoned detective, and that very subtle detail is there, if you paid attention to the film's first act. Some viewers may say that some of its elements are undefined but trust me, Argento didn't miss anything on this one. The viewer only needs to open his mind to the director's methodical approach in this film. Remember, Marcus is an artist and sensitive.

The film does serve its fair share of freaky elements, that carries the Dario Argento ""signature"". There's a weird child with a smile that would give Damien pause, mutilated lizards, a very creepy mechanical doll, paintings that look like it used hell as a model and a dog fight. There are also some inventive ""kill"" sequences by costume jewelry, a lot of hatchet play, knifing, dragging and an elevator disaster. Surprisingly, there is a very small amount of nudity in this film. It's actually only one scene and it's not really in full view.

The film also has some nicely placed bits of humor, I guess to keep the audience in its toes. Gianna's car is just so old and tiny and that scene with the arm wrestling is quite amusing and reflects the usual ""battle of the sexes"". David Hemmings and Daria Nicolodi has a fair amount of chemistry, Darla's antics are quite amusing and serves to lighten the film's mood somewhat. Carlo (Gabriele Lavia) has a transsexual lover and even says one of the film's amusing but memorable lines; ""I love that guy, but he's a downer."" Too bad, Marcus and Gianna didn't play diddle at all.

Now the film does have its share of flaws from its script. I rather found it a little hard to buy into the idea that only Marcus and Gianna were the only ones involved in this investigation. I somewhat wished that the film had more sequences on the police side of the investigation, after all they did manage to show. The cops weren't as inept as I first thought but it does lack some credibility when the police barely had any screen time. The music score by Goblin is quite good and I've read that it inspired Halloween's main theme.

""Deep Red"" may have been made many years ago, but the film while a little dated can still stand on its own. Just keep in mind that this is a film made in 1975 and it still manages to serve up an interesting experience much better than the thrillers of today. This uncensored 126 minute director's cut is actually a lot better than the censored version. The anamorphic transfer is quite good for a film made some 33 years ago and the 5.1 Dolby Digital track is quite powerful. The only complaint I have is that the extended scenes jump to the Italian language because they weren't dubbed in English, which can prove a bit distracting at times. (Not sure what Language it was originally intended)

Despite some technical flaws and some things in its script opened some holes, ""Deep Red"" is an ""artsy"" whodunit feature that serves up the right suspense and is quite disturbing at times. The film is a cerebral experience that makes it far more than your usual ""slasher"" film.

Now why he would do this I don't know, but once you allow for this artistic licence, the film moves by with great pace.

The characters are sympathetic and believable.  The acting is good and the settings are elaborate and gorgeous.  The ending is shocking.  David Hemmings stars as the American pianist who witnesses the brutal hatchet murder of a psychic; Daria Nicolodi (girlfriend of Argento) stars as a reporter.

""Deep Red"" has a scene where a victim is scalded to death by hot bathtub water; it was imitated in John Carpenter`s ""Halloween II.""  The scene where a victim  is drug down the street by a truck may have been borrowed from Emilio P. Miraglia`s ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times.""

1074045,5,630580740X,"The plots to most Dario Argento films are almost identical: a serial killer is on the loose in Italy, and our protagonist (usually played by a young American or Briton, in order to appeal to the American market) must solve the mystery and stop him. ""Deep Red"" fits neatly into this formula, this time with David Hemmings as the detective. Hemmings plays a British Jazz musician who is working in Rome when he witnesses the death of a psychic and decides to solve the mystery. However, never before has Dario Argento done this story so well. As Argento fans would expect, the visuals are stunning, the murders are bloody and the minor characters are weird. Nevertheless, unlike in some other Dario Argento films, this time the script is also pretty good (I watch Dario Argento films for his visuals, not his writing)- it's coherant and it's actually a pretty good mystery/thriller story.

""Deep Red"" marks the commencement of what is considered to be the peak period of Dario Argento's career (the period which began with ""Deep Red"", ended with ""Opera"", and which also included ""Suspiria"", ""Inferno"",  ""Tenebre"", and ""Phenomena"") and is considered by many to be Argento's masterpiece. After seeing this film, I can see why this is so.

This version is the extended version of the film (a shorter version was released under the title ""The Hatchet Murders""). Be aware, however, that this version was created by taking the longer Italian version and combining it with the shorter English language soundtrack. As the Italian version is about 30 minutes longer than the American version, there are many places where no English language soundtrack exists and the film goes into Italian (with English subtitles) at these points.

1074206,5,630580740X,"Deep Red may very well be the most amazing Horror masterpeice to have ever been made in my opinion. Argento's Deep Red is the most stylized, crafted, coherent, and enjoyable movie of his career, and belongs in EVERY Horror fan's collection.
This Giallo shocker clock's in at 126 minutes and is not 1 minute too long. Giallo's are Italian murder mysteries that have amazingly well-crafted story's along the lines of Alfred Hitchcock movies, and the inventive murder scenes of a Friday 13'th movie.
The story is about a Musician who moves to Italy and happens to witness a very brOOtal murder and decides to investigate further. This story has many twists and turns, and encourages the viewer to try and guess who the killer is, and if you've seen any of Dario's other Giallo's you know he makes it almost impossible to figure out, which I find to be a real challenge and increases the replay value quite a bit.
If you were to ask me ""Is this Dario's Argento's best film?"" I'd say ""HELL YES!"" But when people ask me what my favorite Dario Argento movie is I usually say: Deep Red, Susperia, Tenebre, Inferno, Opera, Phenomena, and The Bird With the Crystal Plumige. I love them all eqaully and having to decide between them is impossible to me.

You won't have a lot of love for the characters in this movie because they show absolutely no depth or emotion. The bad lighting is supposed to help set the atmosphere but it is more annoying than helpful. However, Argento does demonstrate some very good camera angles that emphasize the use of shadow and light.

It has manages to combine comedy, suspense, and horror all quite effectively along with his trademark camera work.  Like most giallos, ""Deep Red"" is more a murder mystery than a horror film, but unlike other giallos in which the identity of the killer is apparent to the audience early on, Argento keeps the viewer guessing until the end.",1183939200,2,622,4.839622641509434
1074211,5,630580740X,"To me, this is where Dario Argento's career really started. He had made 4 films prior to this (the ""animal"" trilogy, and a barely seen Western, The Five Days of Milan), but I never liked his early films (I saw The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Cat o' Nine Tails. Bird is decent, but rather boring. Cat is terrible, especially in its dubbed version). The amazing thing about Profondo Rosso (aka Deep Red...the original Italian title sounds so much better) is that even in its mutilated 98 minute version, it was still amazing (though incoherent) filmmaking. Essentially, the American distributor cut out 28 minutes of really important plot detail, but left most of the violence in the film. Now, Anchor Bay has given you the original film, and in the original Italian with English subtitles. The longer version is much more coherent, explaining the plotline and the motivations of the characters, and giving more of a role to Daria Niccolodi, Dario's girlfriend of 10 years. The music of Goblin (their 1st colloboration with Dario) is magnificent. It's just as good as their Suspiria soundtrack, and the fusion of Dario's cinematic sense and Goblin's music sense is one of the most fruitful colloborations in cinema history. The performances here are above average for a Dario film, with David Hemmings playing the usual English speaking artistic type getting caught up in a murder mystery (typical Argento plot). It's nice to see Argento's work restored, as almost EVERY film he did during his heyday was cut and sometimes renamed (for example, Phenomena was cut by 28 minutes and retitled Creepers, and Tenebrae was cut by 9 minutes and retitled Unsane). This was Dario's first masterpiece, and the beginning of a remarkable run for him up through his last great film, Opera.

It also features (unusually for an Argento film, as he's not known for his patience with actors) a truly convincing performance by the main man, David Hemmings.

The Blue Underground edition is exactly the same print of the film as the Anchor Bay release (now out of print), which means it has sections that drop into Italian dialogue (some sections the English could not be found for, and some it was never recorded for as the scenes were never included in the international versions, only the Italian cut).

Whilst it is great to see the movie complete, it is very distracting to switch randomly and without warning between Italian language with subtitles and English without.. which leads to a temptation to watch the whole movie in Italian. Whilst this is usually a good idea with Argento's films, Hemming's performance in Deep Red is so subtle and nuanced that it is a great shame to diminish it by watching it with Italian dubbing.

1074320,2,630580740X,"I was so supprised when I saw how many Argento fans prefer this film to his rest. Some even deem it his masterpiece.

Personally, I was utterly disappointed with it, as it drags more than any of his other films, and his characters are bland ( save the quirky reporter chick, who goes a little over the top, and the fantastic German psychic in the beginning).

The lead male has virtually no emotion to him whatsoever; I will never forget how poorly the actor did when he encountered all the murder victims. He had no emotion whatsoever, and even when SPOILER SPOILER the death of his lover/the reporter doesn't cause him to feel much.

On top of the poor acting, the film has no climax and if it weren't the AMAZING Goblin soundtrack, the film would be beyond terrible.

What is classic, amazing Argento? Well, if you watch the first 20 minutes of Deep Red, you see a few amazing scenes that draw you into the film. The main scene I am referring to is that of the psychic lady and her friends talking to an audience. The camera work and acting were typical Argento. You can see this in his real masterpiece, Suspiria.

The rest of the film still has the great camera angles and such, but with pointless scenes ( such as many between the reporter and the lead guy).

If you want to see Argento at his best- great plots that unfold, amazing soundtracks by Goblin or other artists, corny but good acting, creepyness, and amazing sets, rent the following:

Suspiria

Inferno

Opera

Trauma ( yes, many people hate it, but it beats Deep Red and has a great theme,' Ruby Rain')

I also reccommend renting all of his films and buying anything that Goblin does. They are unparalelled.

All in all, I give Deep Red a 2 stars for its dullness. If he had cast a better lead male and had stayed away from the over-the-top ( even for Argento, DR's murder scenes were just....) And stuck with the type of creepy, eerie scenes he did in Inferno and Suspiria.

1074322,5,630580740X,"Prior to the hallucinatory supernatural nightmare of ""Suspiria"" Dario Argento produced a sequence of four murder mysteries which presented audiences with the flip side of the chic cosmopolitan art cinema of the 1960's. Wonderful production values, beautiful set designs and use of colour were still maintained, but instead of following the paranoid wanderings of some isolated figure trying to find his place in society, Argento exploded the myth and showed the violence, perversity and sadism that was barely concealed under the bourgeious veneer. Like all great murder mysteries ""Deep Red"" retains its secrets until the end, but peppers the detective narrative with some truly extraordinary murder set pieces.  Art in ""Deep Red"" becomes a wider metaphor for madness, the killers face indistinct from a portrait. There is an implied violence and human failing in the culture of this artistic world, a musician suffering a crisis of sexuality, a musician who acknowledges his homosexuality, but his broken by dark familial secrets from the past, and an actress who remains firmly  embedded in the violence of the past. The most progressive character is a female journalist played with breezy optimism by Daria Nicolodi, which is one in the eye for those who dismiss Argento as a misogynist. This is all fused together by a groundbreaking electronic rock sound track by Goblin whose discordant music fit's the decadent visuals beautifully. A symphony of death and destruction only matched by ""Suspiria""

 Although Anchor Bay's disc is somewhat light on supplementary materials, the print presented here is excellent and is the complete version. I feel however that this is not the final answer for ""Deep Red"" on DVD and am certain a release will emerge in the future which does this landmark Italian giallo fuller justice.",1168300800,2,1821,5.247422680412371

Brilliant and startling Italian horror thriller shocker from the Italian master of terror Dario Argento (""Suspiria"", ""Phenomena"") that is considered by critics to be his best movie! i have to disagree cause i believe that's Suspiria to be his masterpiece while this is his second best movie. The acting is good with the music score by Goblin being superb, there's plenty of good gory killing scenes and scares such as the memorable robotic doll sequence! it's a dark and broadening thriller that will keep you on the edge of your toes and will have you guessing until the very twisted ending.

Especially this one as, I'd heard it to be his ""masterpiece"". Luckily now, I was able to see what everyone was talking about.

Deep Red is a visually stunning film as are all of his works. Arguably the best Argento film, shot in glorious widescreen with some incredible screen compositions . Very effective scares throughout featuring great murder scenes typical to the director.  Dario Argento's rare visions and a creepy score by ""Goblin"" make for a truly chilling, moviegoer experience. I guess people condsider it to be Argento's masterpiece because the plot seems to come together with more fluidity than his other works. All and all it is a great work of art and a definite classic.

The only flaw that I saw, and luckily I rented this first, is not with the movie but with the DVD itself. Maybe it was my version but there were parts that switch back and forth from English dubbing to Italian with English subtitles. I hear that's the way Anchor Bay transferred onto the DVD. I read a review that said if you can stand subtitles to watch the whole movie in Italian as the voices dubbed over don't catch the mood of the actors. I will rent it again and do exactly that.

About Fear.

I don't mean the giddy, cozy shivers you get that makes you want to watch the cheap and banal slasher flick through your fingers, giggling like a fool the whole time. No, I mean Fear: Fear that comes floating into your brain at 3 in the morning, as you lie in your suddenly cold and vast bed, listening to the house creak and groan, wondering---well, God, it's silly, but still---didn't that creak, that shifting floorboard you heard just now, close to your bedroom door---well didn't it sound just a little too *stealthy*?

The fear that creeps over you and brands your naked back with a flotilla of goosebumps while you're taking that early morning shower, the outdoor blackness pressed close up to the house windows: the conviction that when the water and your fumbling hands wipe away the soap and lather, someone---something---else will have joined you in the shower. Something that wants to play and giggle and roll in your blood.

Yes. Now we're talking Fear, aren't we? Now you're with me: good.

""Deep Red"" (the Italian 'Profondo Rosso') is Italian Grandmaster of Horror Dario Argento's masterwork of sick, revulsive, shudder-inducing Fear: it is gorgeous, jaw-dropping, ambitiously brutal, leeringly primal, as if Argento had furiously shoved a syringe straight into the pulsing, fevered brain of a serial killer, and drained the nightmares out of the creature's gibbering mind.

""Deep Red"" is Nightmare made Flesh, and Flesh made Film.

American jazz musician Marcus Daly (the late, incomparable David Hemmings)is working in Rome: he composes, performs, dallies, drinks, and engages in bibulous battinage with sexually confused, angst-ridden friend Carlo (Gabriele Lavia, channeling a little of Fellini's ""Satyricon"" for our amusement).

All of this is brought to a halt when Daly witnesses a woman---a Ukrainian psychic (Macha Meril, insanely overracting---and oddly, it works)---slaughtered in her home by a black-gloved maniac, butchered like a pig or a cow. He witnesses this rapine from a Roman courtyard, and arrives to late to save her---but soon enough to glimpse a portrait, forgotten in the insanity of theo moment, but recalled after events lose their immediacy and begin to gel.

Oh---and after the Maniac demonstrates its interest in Marcus Daly. It enters his Roman apartment, while he composes on his piano; he is saved by noting those stealthy noises typically heard by nervous insomniacs at 3 in the morning, and watching a long shadow fall across the threshold of his study. He manages to leap up and close the study door, even as the Thing whispers its hellish ambitions through impenetrable wood.

Argento is a wizard. He conjures up his necromantic magic through high style: watch the camera in the opening sequences, as it arcs down like a vicious, hungry bird of prey over the audience, summoned to hear the psychic: watch as it glimpses the Killer in a dingy, begrimed, fog-sooted restroom mirror; recoil as it follows---faithfully,like a staid documentarian---the brutal slaughter of a girl in an isolated country cottage, her death prescribed by immersion in boiling water.

Or, for sheer gut-clenching shrill terror, try out the lonely death of Professor Giordani (Glauco Mauri), who dies a dog's death, death too easily imagined by those who have fallen against a sharp surface---a death pilloried, lampooned, by the twisted, robotic, dwarf creature that enters through the Professor's study door (anticipating, and doubtless inspiring, James Wan's nightmarish tricycle puppet in ""Saw"").

""Deep Red"" is undeniably Argento's dark lodestone, a treasure gleaming and glimmering and seducing the unwary in the darkness, a brilliant accomplishment he rarely approached, even as his capacity for the craft grew. ""Suspiria"", perhaps, is as close as the Master came to this dark, poisonous, armor-piercing bullet of pure horror.

The delirious, dark delight of ""Deep Red"" is the intense, nearly sexual beauty, and intensity, of death and its Soldiers: the remastered deluxe edition merely underscores a movie astonishingly vivid in color and brutally ambitious in scope. From the moment the blood-red velvet opera-house curtains are parted, through the night-haunted cobblestones of haunted modern Rome, ""Deep Red"" is murderous---and glorious in its bloodthirsty frenzy.

Evil is whispering on the other side of the door. Escape---or talk to it. Flee the madness, or engage it: this is Argento's legacy in ""Deep Red"". Tremble.

1074452,5,630580740X,"Deep Red-Dario Argento's masterpiece.  Though it's not my personal favorite of his, I can really see why it's regarded at his best.  Deep Red is a 2+ hour giallo epic.  Argento has found his style now , so you can imagine the look and sound of this film(it was the first to use Goblin's music).  It's not quite as wild, colorful and violent as Suspiria, but I really wouldn't suggest watching it on a first date.  We got an English pianist living in Rome who's only friends seem to be another pianist and his mother(the prototype for the whole ""engineer"" joke that runs throughout Michele Soavi's Cemetery Man).  He witnesses a gruesome murder by a guy in a hat and raincoat(of course), becomes obsessed and launches his own investigation(of course), and winds up pursued by the killer himself(of course).  I still can't get over how Argento can keep using this plotline and give it enough twists and turns so that it never once seems tired or repetitive.  It's all in the storytelling, people!  Anchor Bay has done their best to restore this film.  The picture is fantastic, but some of the english dialogue couldn't be saved, so be prepared to be reading subtitles practically midsentence when a character is speaking.  You'll get used to this very fast though.  I could say more, but if you're an Argento fan(which most likely you are), I'd just be preaching to the converted.  If  you're wondering, ""what's the big deal with this Dario guy?"", then Deep Red and Suspiria would both be excellent starting points for you.

1074589,4,630580740X,"Plot Synopsis: Marc witnesses the murder of his upstairs neighbor. He and a reporter, Gianna, attempt to find the killers identity. The killer continues to strike, and it becomes clear that Marc is one of the intended victims.

I have a number of minor problems with this film, which I'll discuss upfront. Most significantly the investigation portions of the film are not fully satisfying, because Marc and Gianna always seem to find the next step through incredibly lucky guessing and/or unlikely coincidence.  For example prior to an attempted murder Marc hears a creepy little song playing, and while investigating it learns of a reputedly haunted house which was known for having creepy children's music emanating from it. Naturally, this house turns out to be crucial to the investigation.  It is an extraordinary bit of luck on their part to come across this information, and it's pretty much par the course for this film as they blindly stumble from one unlikely clue to the next. Personally, this is just inherently unsatisfying, and strikes me as a bit lazy, as if they didn't think it worth the time or effort to come up with any truly plausible way for them to solve the case.  But, this only really bothered me in retrospect, so it likely won't both you while you're watching it. Although I already knew before viewing the film, so I don't know if this would have applied to me, I suspect most people will have no difficulty guessing who the killer is. (Primarily because there are so few characters in the film that they aren't many options) Still, this doesn't matter much, as most of the enjoyment is found in how the film is presented more than the plot. Pacing is occasionally a bit of a problem, as Gianna and Marc tend to go on about nothing in particular. I don't think it ever really gets boring, but it would've been tenser and more involving had they sped it up a little.  The acting and dubbing in this film are competent if not really remarkable. None of the protagonists are all that appealing, really, but the interest in the murders and the mystery alone are sufficient to make you involved in the film. The music is a tad hit and miss.  The main theme is very good, but there is one recurring theme which is used for some of the murder scenes which simply doesn't work. It's too peppy and happy sounding. Still, it's generally at least pretty good. It also deserves some credit for being fairly different from most soundtracks you'll here, as it is some weird atmospheric-synth-jazz stuff. Still, despite these few flaws this film is consistently watchable and entertaining.

Though not as visually accomplished as his next film, Suspiria, this is still a highly stylized and visually appealing film. In this film the emphasis is more on novel camera angles and movements then on unusual set design and lighting, but it's still quite striking visually.(and the more flamboyant Suspiria style visuals wouldn't really be appropriate anyway.) Argento uses very nice and rather creepy perspective shots. I'm also particularly found of the scenes of the camera creeping about what we presume to be the killers house, viewing various items.

The murder/death scenes are very nicely done and are one of the highlights of the film. Although not extremely gory by modern day standards, they are quite vicious and intense, and are cleverly shot and staged. They also manage to bring out the inherent horror in violence which is so often lacking, intentionally or unintentionally. That is to say, the murders seem very, very painful, which is more affecting than just having them be very gory.  It also manages to generate some genuine tension prior to the murders. The second killing is especially effective in this manner. I also really like the use of the killers creepy calling cards.(the song, the doll, drawings etc.)

What I really like about Deep Red is that unlike some of Dario Argento's other movies (like Stendhal Syndrome), the ending was completely unexpected and nobody expected it. That plot-twist was brilliant and very well concealed. Anywhom, this is an incredible giallo. For the starting Argento fan, I'd reccomend this, his first film ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"", ""Tenebre"".

Unlike many of Argento's subsequent movies, Deep Red's plot is very well constructed, and the careful viewer (well...the VERY careful viewer) can pick up at least two crucial clues. The first, in the very first minutes of the movie, is central to the plot, but it is very easy to miss. It makes for a nice challenge to the first time viewer. Deep Red marks, in my opinion, the highest level of Argento's work. The atmosphere of the movie is greatly enhanced by the first collaboration of Argento with the musical group Goblin. A great soundtrack. I saw this movie first when I was a young student. Now,I saw it again to keep me company during my weekly long run on the treadmill.

I loved Suspiria, Inferno, and Phenomena and I read that Deep Red was one of his best, so I bought it. I for one thought this uncut version would be great, but it's actually the cut material spliced back in the film that hinders it, at least for me. The newly restored material was never dubbed, so through out the entire film we get little pieces here and there spliced in that are spoken Italian with subtitles. It's really annoying because the characters will be talking in English at one moment and then suddenlly halfway through their sentence, their voice changes sound and they are speaking Italian. I found this quite annoying and distracting because it takes you out of the film. Also most of the ""new"" restored material doesn't add a whole lot to the film. Most of it is just talking that adds really nothing new to the plot. I would have probably liked this film better if I saw the cut version, which is strange for me to say because I usually like ""extended"" versions of films. Overall Deep Red had plenty of style but little substance. I can see why die-hard Argento fans like this film because it is thick with his style, but for casual fans like me, we have seen him do much better. I for one found this film to drag and, should I dare say, get boring in some parts. People new to Argento are better to start off somewhere else.",1076716800,,1449,4.37037037037037

2. When you see a woman being beaten to death with a meat cleaver, the most sensible course of action is to run immediately to the scene (preferably unarmed).
3. If you find yourself being chased around by a hatchet-wielding maniac, remember that elevators make good weapons.
4. Jazz pianists are unbelievably dim-witted.
The thing to remember about Dario Argento's movies is that style is treated with more importance than plot or dialogue. ""Deep Red"" has little in the way of original plot (owing much to Antonioni's ""Blow Up"" or Argento's own ""The Bird With The Crystal Plumage""), and some of the interaction between David Hemmings and Daria Nicolodi is painful to watch and listen to. The fact that the language sometimes switches back and forth between Italian and English in the middle of a scene is only a minor distraction, but it doesn't do much in the film's favour.
I can't agree with those who describe this as Argento's best, but it's still a very entertaining couple of hours (probably closer to 3.5 stars). Inventive killings, several red herrings to keep the viewer on edge (including one which, admittedly, is so blindingly obvious that it made me wonder how Hemmings' character took so long to realise it himself - see point 4 above), and an underlying sense of malice running through the entire film make for an uncomfortable experience....but it's uncomfortable in a good way. A word of warning, though: if you're *too* perceptive, you'll know the killer's identity very early in the movie. It's a question of knowing where to look.
Aside from the constant switching between languages, my only real gripe with the film would be its soundtrack. The music, by Goblin, is highly effective for some scenes, but in others (especially when Hemmings enters the House of Ghosts) it sounds like it's been lifted verbatim from ""Tubular Bells"" and at other times it sounds like a bad imitation of Emerson, Lake & Palmer.
Having said that, I think the positives of ""Deep Red"" outweigh the negatives, and provide a good buildup for what I think was Argento's real masterpiece - ""Deep Red""'s follow-up, ""Suspiria"".",1074384000,3,2185,4.892183288409703
1074596,5,630580740X,"I really couldn't tell you why I have yet to watch every film in Dario Argento's filmography, but by watching ""Deep Red,"" I am finally starting to make some inroads into his body of work. It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's important works a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere, let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands. Even Troma, the flagship of flaccid filmmaking, released a so-so version of Argento's ""The Stendhal Syndrome."" It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated formats. Unfortunately, most viewers have most likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days, more people are familiar with the director's beautiful daughter Asia than with the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. For a few years in the 1980s and 1990s, Argento drifted away from his tried and true giallo formula, only recently returning to some semblance of form with ""Stendhal"" and ""Sleepless."" ""Deep Red"" is Argento firmly entrenched in his giallo prime, a movie loaded with black-gloved killings, intricate plot twists and turns, and atmosphere so think you can cut it with a knife.
Starring David Hemmings (who recently passed away) and Dario's real life squeeze Daria Nicolodi, ""Deep Red"" continually reminded me of his first picture, ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" because Argento presents with essentially the same set up. This time around we have American jazz musician Marcus Daly (Hemmings) witnessing the gruesome murder of his psychic neighbor in an apartment building. Intrigued, Daly starts to investigate the crime and soon runs into a chatty Italian journalist named Gianna (Nicolodi). Predictably, he soon runs into trouble with the local cops and comes to suspect that the murderer is looking to have a good old face to face meeting with the man who witnessed his bloody work. Daly must attempt to put the pieces of the crime together if he wishes to save his life, a process that becomes problematic as he deals with the blundering interference of Gianna. You know Daly will solve the crime by identifying the killer, and you know Argento will take you on the most roundabout way to that end, but that doesn't lessen the fun in getting there. That creepy, abandoned house where Daly must go to discover vital clues to the killer's identity towards the end is only the last eerie set piece in a film loaded with them. I now understand why ""Deep Red"" is a cult classic and considered one of the premier giallo films.
The gore here is standout stuff, and, let's face it, that's one thing we all want to see in an Argento film. There's a few stabbings, of course, but there are also scenes virtually insuring a good cringe. A face dunked in boiling water, a horrific death involving a head bashed against sharp furniture corners (!!), a seriously bizarre decapitation, and a head crushed under a tire (I've seen a few of these lately in several different films, disturbingly enough) all take place in graphic, stomach churning close up. I noticed that Argento recycled a few of things seen here in ""Sleepless,"" but that in no way mitigates the grisly effect of them in ""Deep Red."" Humorous scenes, such as Daly's attempts to adjust his body to the contours of Gianna's decrepit car, provide a necessary breather between gore sequences but the high sauce content in the movie still got under my skin. Moreover, Argento marries the atrocities with frequently clever clues that help move the plot along. For example, the scalding scene sees the victim using a finger to leave a message on the steamed up wall of the bathroom before death sets in. Obviously, for anyone to see the message again the bathroom must be filled with steam. Neat little tricks like this one make me want to hug Argento if I ever meet the guy because these flourishes make ""Deep Red"" light years better than most of the junk out there today.
The movie couldn't get any better than it is already, right? Wrong. Goblin scored this Argento giallo, marking the start of a lengthy collaboration. A soundtrack for a film that has as its main character a jazz musician better go far beyond the merely good. In fact, the background music here is downright ominous times ten. Goblin gives the movie a sort of wacked out synthesized sound; a thumping, rollicking beat that ratchets up certain scenes of tension to an unbearable level. As I watched the film, I kept wishing other movies would achieve such a wonderful marriage of what you see and what you hear. Almost everything comes together in ""Deep Red"": the vicious gore scenes, the involved plot, and the background music all meld together into a truly enjoyable outing.
The only problem I had with the movie, and one I have seen mentioned by other viewers, is the occasionally plodding pace of the film. Remember, this DVD gives you the uncut, two-hour plus version of Argento's masterwork, so it is quite lengthy. The other reviewers are correct to take the director to task for this minor flaw, as several scenes feel superfluous to the general scope of the film. Having said this, I will still take this movie over most of the crud foisted on the public today because the pluses totally overwhelm the negatives in this picture. A must see for horror fans, ""Deep Red"" would also provide a good starting point for the Argento newbie. You will love it.",1072656000,2,5671,4.811475409836065

The colors, the suspense, the story, the camera works and the murder scenes in which you really believe to be victim or the murderer are just fabulous. It gives the idea that you are part of the story. This is probably something that is missing these days or never existed in the american style thrillers. The score from the Goblins is probably one of the best for this kind of movie and it keeps you in a very frightening mood.  The acting is funny, the team Daria Nicolodi/David Hemmings is one of the best i`ve ever seen.  They really seem to enjoy doing this film.

1074705,3,630580740X,"Let me begin by stating that stylistically this film approaches art.  Others have noted that Argento is the ""Italian Hitchcock,"" and while there are plenty of Hitchcock-like elements, such a title is really too limiting.  Argento was not afraid to steal good ideas.  Hitchcock can be seen in his camera angles during knife attacks, his first-person murder viewpoint, the steamy attack in a bathroom, the death of the attacking bird, etc,; Hopper inspired a life-size version of his painting ""Nighthawks"" in the middle of an Italian piazza; Munch can be seen in the paintings on the wall; and Sergio Leone (whom Argento worked with on the great ""Once Upon a Time in the West"") definitely impacted Argento's sweeping panoramic shots.  Together they add up to a fantastically stylish production that is unique to the horror genre.  The incongrous mixture of beauty and death makes the film that much more macabre.  I especially enjoyed the bright red that marks the parapsychology conference and the blue of the bathroom scene.
Argento's choice of Goblin to perform the music was a risky, yet inspired, one.  In their soundtrack you can easily hear the strains of the music that would one day make the movie Halloween one of the scariest ever made.  Repetitive and intense, it almost becomes a character in the movie, driving the action forward.  That being said, at times the band overplayed it's hand, if you will.  There are several scenes where the music becomes too loud and verges on annoying.  Still, it is worth a listen.
Now for the down part: while Argento was a masterful director, I personally found the plotline to be a bit cheesy and was never scared or anxious during the entire movie.  Perhaps it is years of escalating violence in horror movies, but the murder scenes seemed almost trite, and the suspense was second rate.  Hemmings was wonderful as the protagonist -- a man driven by his need to find the truth about what he's seen, but the violence he encounters is more gory than scary.  The minor characters are either Felliniesqe (Gallo's gay lover) or bumbling (the police).  In the end, I was neither surprised to discover the killer or interested in their comeuppence.
So take this film for what it is worth -- a new art in making horror films that would impact many movies to follow.  Enjoy the direction, but don't expect too much of the plot.",1071705600,2,2367,4.807407407407408
1074706,5,630580740X,"Rather than go into the plot of the movie, which a lot of the reviews already have done (and probably much better than I ever could), I'd like to discuss a little bit about what makes Deep Red so good, and why if you haven't seen it, you should.
Dario Argento has been described as the Italian Hitchcock. If you're a Hitchcock fan like me, then you're thinking one word: blasphemy! Hold on there just one minute, tiger. Before we jump to conclusions, let's check out Deep Red.
The cool thing about Dario is that he uses the camera to trick you. In this way, it's better to compare him with Brian De Palma. In their thrillers (think De Palma's Dressed to Kill), they use the camera to show you something, but by the end of their films, you realize what you thought you saw was something else entirely.
This is the case with Deep Red. David Hemmings, playing a jazz singer who gets caught up in a web of murder and intrigue (sound like a Hitchcock movie yet?) witnesses a brutal murder, but when he goes back to the scene of the crime, something seems different. Something is missing...
Dario uses his camera to stage inventive and suspenseful scenes. The difference between Argento and Hitchcock is pretty big... Argento goes the Italian giallo way with the deaths. That is, he shows you EVERYTHING. In an Argento movie, murder is an art form. One woman is dispatched in a bathtub of boiling hot water. The camera remains stationary as the killer lifts the woman's head up just so we can see the flesh peeling off her face. Gruesome stuff.
The mystery of Deep Red is engrossing. Hemmings goes around, finding clues, and tries to piece everything together. Eventually, he realizes what he really saw the night of the murder. Is the pay-off worth it? Almost. As with a lot of Argento thrillers, you can't help but wonder how the culprit could have actually done all the carnage he or she was supposed to.
The performances in the movie are great. Hemmings works with Daria Nicolodi nicely, and we care about both of these characters. They are intelligent, charming, and funny. More Argento movies needed these types of characters a.k.a. someone we can relate to.
Still, Deep Red is a cool ride with some interesting visuals. Say what you want about Argento, the man knows how to set-up a scene to look gorgeous. If you're looking for an involving thriller and are wondering why so many horror fans love Dario Argento, Deep Red is a great place to start finding out. Is he the Italian Hitchcock? Probably not. But he can make a darned entertaining film.",1062892800,,2548,4.602197802197802

There are people here at Amazon who thought this is Argento's best. Others share a different opinion. I seriously don't know who is telling the TRUTH, simply because I can't make a judgment after having seen only two of his creations. And besides, it's of little importance.

1074708,4,630580740X,"Describing this movie as ""Argentio's Masterpiece"" is stretching the truth a bit in my opinion. Having said that, though, it stands well above so many other films in the horror/giallo style that it seems picky to find faults...but there are a few.
 Firstly, the praise - Deep Red, for those who haven't seen it, is a mind blowing cinematic treat. Incredibly gory murders, convoluted plot, red herrings galore, this film has it all. Argento is one of the most stylish horror directors int the world. There are so many moments of jaw-dropping genius that it's impossible to list them. The print on this DVD looks absolutely gorgeous, with bright colours and crisp sharp widescreen presentation making it the best this movie has ever looked, certainly, I have never seen it looking this good.
It's also the longest version ever seen in English, and it's there that, sadly, the film's flaws start showing up. As other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the inserted footage is all in Italian, so subtitles are provided whenever the characters suddenly switch languages...soemtimes in the middle of a conversation! This gets very annoying after a while. It would be ok if the missing scenes were crucial to understanding the bizarre mystery at the centre of the plot, but they aren't, they mostly show in more detail the blossoming comedy/romance relationship between Marc and Gianna, which may have been entertaining for Italian audiences, but does not enhance the experience of watching the film in English at all. Other missing scenes involve members of the police laughing at their own jokes , and people in cafes and streets chatting about inconsequential topics...hardly great additions!
I hate to say it, but it would have served the DVD edition better if these had been left out... a dual presentation that also offered the shorter version of the film totally in English would have been perfect. This is not to deter people from the film, but it is a shame that all the good work by Anchor Bay has resulted in a film that plays better for film completists than for a newcomer or casual horror fan.",1048723200,3,2099,4.879551820728292
1074709,2,630580740X,"To put Deep Red into perspective, it was this film that Dario Argento began to find his cinematic 'voice'. While his previous efforts such as co-writing 'Once Upon A Time In The West' to his Bava influenced animal giallos and his horrible political comedy 'Five Days In Milan' were daring in some respects...Deep Red provided for a film standard that he would continue to use as recently as Non Ho Sonno (Sleepless). While Deep Red is fairly coherent in comparison to other giallos at the time (Torso and Autopsy in particular), I did find some introduced plot twists that seemed to have died mid-stream in the film. For example:
 1. Daria Nicolodi's role of the go-get 'em journalist seems awkward...her scenes with David Hemmings seem forced and bog down the film.
 2. The killer's sexual orientation. This sub plot could have given the viewing audience insight into the killer's psychosis and/or feelings of social rejection.
 3. The ESP/telepathy subject brought on early in the film was VERY interesting...only to die a solemn death.
  I wouldn't call Deep Red a masterpiece but rather a sophomoric release even though it was the fifth film Argento worked on. While Argento was redefining 'art as violence', and it shows well here...his narratives were still in a stage of infancy.",1048723200,,1286,4.962790697674419

The entire movie fits so well emotionally; dreamlike and ""sublime"" to make useless any deepening of an eventual illogical scene.

1074711,5,630580740X,"Not only is the best Argento film, but it is one of my favourite films of all time. I'm not too big on the horror genre, but Deep Red has a depth and style that other films sorely lack. Argento has turned a typical giallo story into a maserpiece: stunning micro-camera work, stylistic murders, brilliant photography, beautiful colour schemes, and an amazing soundtrack.
 What makes this film, though, is the tacit criticism of Freudian analysis.  In the murder mystery that forms the core of the movie an Oedipal triangle is set up through misinterpreted clues. This triangle, however, is ultimately broken when other clues--that don't fit into this structure--problematize the whole Oedipal narrative. I was able to use parts of this film for my MA thesis in philosophy to illustrate points made by Deleuze and Guattari in ""Anti-Oedipus""; it fit perfectly.",1036627200,2,857,5.070921985815603

An often confusing storyline comes together rather than falls  apart in hopeless incoherence as so often happens with Argento. David Hemmings is very good as the perplexed musician inadvertantly drawn into a baffling (and gory) murder mystery with occult overtones. The set pieces are remarkable - most especially the walking dummy (!) that pays a surprise visit to Hemmings character in one memorable sequence. This film is supposedly part of a ""trilogy"" that includes ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno"". But, in my opinion, ""Deep Red"" and ""Suspiria"" are the masterworks here.

There are a lot of layers circulating throughout the movie, giving it depth beyond the normal genre ""slasher"" flick. That said, its also one of the more gruesome films that Dario directed. With killings involving cleavers, oddly conceived decapitations, and other unique methods of murder that I won't mention for fear of spoiling them, it manages to keep the gore lover's attention without insulting them.
With film restoration adding to the movie, you are given a clearer overall picture of what Argento wanted to present as well, despite language switches causing the need for subtitles throughout the movie.

1074816,4,630580740X,"""Deep Red"" is a cult classic I might never have seen, save for the programming gurus at the Independent Film Channel.  After seeing it one night around Halloween last year, I went out and bought it the next day.  Featuring a great horror story, a classic horror score, and a standard-setting directorial tour de force, ""Deep Red"" is a must for any viewer and especially so for any cult film enthusiasts (who, of course, probably already know this).
The first thing I was struck by in this film is the obvious influence of Sergio Leone, who helped give director Argento his first big break as a screenwriter in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".  Like Leone's films, the camera is almost another person, constantly on the move and coming at the film from many assorted angles.  Argento takes it even further, and the camera becomes his partner in crime - constantly giving the audience the camera angle most guaranteed to make viewers jump out of their seats.  Complimenting the camerawork to utter perfection is the frantic score by the rock band Goblin and composer Giorgio Gaslini, music that is cited by John Carpenter as a primary inspiration for his own films.
The actors, led by David Hemmings (reprising, in a way, his role in ""Blow Out"", the film that inspired Argento to write ""Deep Red""), are all well-cast and are nuanced (or quirky) enough to come off as multi-dimensional, regardless of how big or small their roles are.  What knocks the film from a five to a four, at least in terms of reviewing this ""full-length"" version of the film, are the restored scenes with Daria Nicolodi and David Hemmings, which account for 90% of the scenes reconstituted into the film.  The scenes stand against the rest of the film, playing only for laughs and taking away from whatever suspense or breathlessness had been built up until then.  It is not hard to see why they were cut originally, though it is surprising to learn from one of the interviews that Argento wanted them in the whole time.  They are a minus to an otherwise perfect film experience.  Honestly, each time I watch the DVD now, I cannot help but think of Heather Graham in ""Bowfinger"", convincing the screenwriter (and whoever else had any power) to put in some ""hot new scenes"".
That being said, even the most major of detractions, distractions, and whatnot cannot remove the well-earned cult classic status this film has achieved.  For either the casual horror film viewer or the motivated cult film enthusiast, ""Deep Red"" is an absolute must for seeing.",1018310400,,2521,4.745995423340961
1074817,5,630580740X,"So much better than all the summer camp slasher [stuff] pushed on us here in the USA. Argento's movies don't ever follow ""waking world"" logic; he writes more like a surrealist who uses the technique of ""automatic writing"": he sits down at his computer and types out the scenes that flicker through his mind. Afterwards there is very little editing/rewriting, if any. You can clearly see this lack of revision in all his movies, but if you're ok with it then you should love his works, especially this one. Here we have a jazz pianist who sees his downstairs neighbor, a psychic lady, being killed on the same day she gave a conference. She was done in because she detected a killer's mind in her audience and managed to pick up the madman's identity. Anyone who ever embraced the myth of detective work will love it as the pianist takes it upon himself to put the pieces of the puzzle together. This was one of severl inspirations for John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN I & II ... Proof that not all slasher flicks are a waste of celluloid.",1015891200,2,1032,4.553763440860215

Giallo Rule Number 2: Make  the motives of the killer interesting. Or at least entertaining. Dario falls short. Argento's Rule Number 1: Kill of Daria Nicoldi's character. Well, this is when Dario and Daria were sleeping together so I guess it doesn't count. The restored version included quasi-interesting plot points only to go nowhere with them. Half of it is Bernadino(?) Zapponi's fault for co-writting the script.

1074819,4,630580740X,"Call Profondo Rosso a transition between Dario Argento's mystery thrillers and his horror movies, because there are elements of both here.  Argento's technique is working up the tension in the audience, be it lurking shadowy figures, objects that lend a more eerie meaning and is meant to get beneath the viewer's skin--the actual killings themselves are the climactic results of the above two.
The jarring opening sets the stage for the movie, a child's record playing, followed by a ghastly scream, the shadow of someone stabbing another person over and over, and a bloody knife falling to the floor, with a child's stockinged feet appearing in view.
One example of foreshadowing tension is seen in the parapsychology conference, where German psychic Helga Ullman recoils in horror as she senses an evil mind in the audience.  ""I can feel death in the room.  I feel a presence, a twisted mind sending thoughts, perverted murderous thoughts. ...You have killed, and you will kill again.""  Those final words are not only prophetic, they seal Helga's fate.
Trying to figure out the mystery to Helga's brutal murder are jazz pianist Marcus Daly and brash reporter Gianna Brezzi.  The dynamism between them work well, he is sensitive in an uptight sort of way, she is feeling-oriented in a liberated sort.
One key to the mystery lies in Helga's house, the hall of pictures Marcus strides through trying to reach her.  After the police are done, he feels a painting is missing, having seen something that has subliminally registered inside him.  His drunken fellow musician and friend Carlo tells him that ""you've seen something so important that you can't realize it.""
Another key is an ancient house described by an author of ghost stories and folklores.  Marcus finds a grisly child's drawing plastered over, as well as a corpse in a walled up room.  The scenes in the house alone are worth seeing the movie.  Large ancient houses with hidden secrets play a part in Argento's Suspiria and Inferno as well.
The atmosphere preceding the author's murder is also eerie, as she sees child's doll hanging from the ceiling with a noose, as well as doors left ajar from the killer's entry, and probably the most effective shock of all, the camera zooming in on the closet and the killer's eye opening.
Bits of humor come in as well:  Gianna's dinky little car with jamming passenger door lock and faulty car seat, and the arguing going on between her and Marcus.  And one goof:  Marcus' note tells Gianni he'll be at 24 Via Susa.  When they call the police to report the house burning, they mistakenly say 27 Via Susa.
Profondo Rosso is like Diabolique in that once the hero/heroine finds out who the killer is and what's going on, it's not as novel the second time around.  However, the artistic triumphs are well worth watching again and again.  Daria Niccolodi has the best performance here, vivacious, tenacious, good-looking, and someone who makes a good partner.
The switching from Italian to English dialogue isn't that annoying, although if I had a choice, I'd choose the original Italian straight through.

I'm sorry, but what was Dario thinking?  Rock-sounding music does not increase the scariness of any of his scenes.  It detracts from it.  If there was some truly scary music playing in this film the scare scenes would be ten times more effective, because visually they are brilliant.  That is why I cannot give this film five stars.  I really like it, and will eventually own it, for its visuals and the visceral imagery of violence, which despite the music is still unsettling.  I guess that Italian horror audiences expect that kind of music, but after growing up on Psycho and seeing how horrifying music can make a film, Deep Red's music let me down.

1074936,5,630580740X,"My five stars is for the movie itself and not necessarily for the quality of picture and sound (DVD).  This movie is truly a suspense thriller and I am wondering how much more shocking and thrilling it would have been to see it in 1980 or better yet, 1975 (theatrical release).
Let's see, ""Deep Red"" was originally released in 1975 but then I've also seen January 1980.  Would 1980 be the U.S. release date? I don't know.  ""Suspiria"" was released January 1977.  ""Deep Red"" seems to be like the older, more mature picture.  The release dates confused me because I couldn't believe ""Deep Red"" came after ""Suspiria"".
Regarding the lost English dialogue: The subtitles and switch back + forth didn't really bother me.  What was more shocking was the great change in the voices.  In some ways, the Italian voices seemed more natural -- it depends on the characters.  For example, there is a police detective that eats a sandwich, talks, and laughs simultaneously and that voice is better and quite humorous compared to his English-dubbed voice.  I have not listened to the straight-Italian version yet.  Some of the voice changes seem seamless.  It shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the movie.
Most likely, I will listen to Italian dialogue after I've viewed the DVD a few more times with the English/Italian soundtrack.
I was pleased to see Daria Nicolodi acting.  My first exposure to her was in the 25-year-anniversary special for ""Suspiria"".  Of course, she is 25 years older in that special.
This DVD has some great music again by Goblin but it is different, possibly to keep with a jazz theme.  Some louder portions <of music> and screams have distortion.

I won't go too much into why I like the movie, rather I'll talk about its faults. There are quite a few. Let's take the color of the blood, so crucial to the proceedings. -It unfortunately look more like paint, than real blood. Real blood is much more dark. Never mind. Then there's the Italian policeman, or rather his Italian voice. Awful !. I know they're used to dubbing in Italy, even bad dubbing, but this guy is ridiculous. -Did he think he was working on a comedy ?. Surely Argento could've stopped him. Maybe Dario thought it was funny ?. Who knows. Not too much make sense in this movie. -Like Hemmings' piano-playing character deciding to investigate on his own. And in a perfect world the DVD-people would also have gotten hold of Hemmings again, to re-voice his character's non-English scenes. But you can't have everything, of course. For some reason the most irritating event in the movie, as far as I'm concerned, is the old housekeeper who works for one of the victims. -Her employer has just been violently murdered, and she just goes about her daily business cleaning up the mess like it's the most normal thing in the world !. Mad as a hatter !. I swear I almost heard her whistle. But there are many incomprehensible, almost dream-like and surreal sequences like that. No, I don't know what the walking doll means either, but it's a nice touch. I don't mind long movies, but this one drags a bit and some of the scenes we could do without. In fact, I'm pretty sure Argento would've left the silly arm-wrestling sequence out today. -That scene just goes on and on, and they're not talking about anything important. I think Argento prefers this movie to, say, ""Cat O' Nine Tails"" which also was a long movie, but nothing was wasteful in that one. I actually think ""Cat..."" is a much better film than ""Deep Red"". -All the scenes in ""Cat..."" needed to be there, unlike many in ""Deep Red"". In retrospect, the restoration of ""Deep Red"", as commendable as it is, seems a bit like a case of ""it was possible, so we did it"", but it wasn't really necessary. The film is a welcome, but strange curio now.

Others believe SUSPIRIA is his masterpiece. i belong to the latter group. DEEP RED would be an average giallo if it had not been directed by Argento who always infuses his movies with his own great style which means that they are least good to look at because he has a talent for visuals. DEEP RED was written by Argento and another writer named Zapponi and like always Argento is not the best writer but he usually compensates for his writing with his directing. But here the movie depends on the script and since it does the script brings the movie down a bit. There is a lot of senseless dialogue in this film and that significantly slows it down. It is a great showcase for Argento's visual talent though. The murders are set up and executed very well. And in this film Dario worked with the musical group Goblin for the first time and they would go on to colaborate on the films SUSPIRIA, TENEBRE, PHENOMENA, and most recently in Dario's new film NON HO SONNO (SLEEPLESS).

1075043,5,630580740X,"Many years before Carpenter's Halloween and the Friday the 13th films ushered in the new wave of bloody horror slasher films in the United States; Italian film-makers like Mario Bava, and Dario Argento were re-inventing the horror genre.  Argento updated and modernized the European horror film with a trilogy of films prior to Deep Red (Bird with the Crystal Plumage 1970, Cat O' Nine Tails 1971 and Four Flies on Grey Velvet - 1972).  He was called the Italian Hitchcock with good reason. These films combined the horror and suspense of Hitchcock's The Birds - 1963 , Psycho - 1960 (and later Frenzy - 1972), with modern European attitudes, settings and generous amounts of gore. Like Hitchcock's Vertigo, the logic of many of these films' narrative plot were secondary to the emotional mood and visual poetry on display.  The  Argento films also explore psychology, parapsychology and/or cutting edge technology as well.
Let me talk about a couple things not mentioned in reviews I've read.
After the opening credits, we are at a conference discussing psychic ability and the paranormal.
Later, when the Jazz pianist  looks up at his apartment building, he witnesses his neighbor, the psychic at the conference,  being savagely murdered.  They seem to make eye contact.
I suggest a psychic connection between the two has been made and it is this connection which affects the pianists behavior and is the reason he must solve the murder before he leaves the city.
Later on he recalls when he ran into his neighbors apartment he believed he saw something, something which is later missing, he believes.  Did he see anything at all, or was it a psychic impression which was implanted by his neighbor as they made eye contact?
He reacts to hunches, and seems to almost have some sort of psychic ability later on in the film, though he refuses to completely acknowledge it.  He knows almost instinctively there is something about the old house which holds an important clue to the murder.  He goes to the house, but at first he doesn't find anything. He's trying too hard.  Thinking too logically.  It is only later that suddenly he realizes, almost psychically what he's missed and upon examining the picture he convinces himself his hunch is right and returns to the house to uncover a hidden room.  His alcoholic colleague speaks at length to him about how sometimes the most trivial of things are the most important and the most important of things are often trivial.  His colleague is drinking himself to death, though not talking about the demons which obviously haunt him.  The female reporter talks to him about his nervous habits, which Hemmings wonderfully explains away as him being a sensitive artist and full of quirks. . . but doesn't his artistic sensitivities lend themselves to psychic ones?
At first one might come away from the film thinking, why did they make David Hemmings a Jazz musician and then have him act like a private detective in trying to find the murderer?  Why not have Hemmings be playing a burnt out former police detective whose hobby is jazz?
Yet Florence is a European center for Jazz Artists, and as a sensitive artist type he would be more 'sensitive' to emotional and psychic vibrations.
It's not important to your enjoyment of the film to share my feeling that Hemmings' character has discovered he is psychic without fulling being aware of it. . . butit  might add an added depth to the film the next time you watch it.
Please note the version you should watch is the 126 minute director's cut of the film which has been meticulously restored and is now distributed by Anchor Bay.  The DVD has several added features.  This restored cut uses all of the available English dubbed feature , but 28 minutes of the film are in Italian with English subtitles and it's a bit awkward if watching the dubbed (rather than the Italian language with English Subtitle version) when it switches from English to Italian and subtitles and then back again within the same scene. The English dubbed scenes that were cut for the American release no longer exist which is why it was necessary to present it this way.
The previously U.S. released versions which run 98 minutes are to be avoided.  The film does actually make narrative sense in it's full version, but will not in its truncated version.  Part of the film plays on known fears.  The violence shown is of a nature we are all somewhat familiar with and so has much more impact.  We know what it's like to burn yourself with scalding hot water.... so a murder of a woman involving a bathtub full of scalding hot water is quite horrifying.  Hitting yourself on the corner of a table, or a fireplace mantel is a sensation we know, so a scene where a man is slammed into several sharp corners is quite unsettling.

Originally titled, ""Russo Profundo"", the film is set in Rome where an English pianist witnesses a brutal murder in his tenement.  This is actually considered a remake of Four Flies On Grey Velvet, but this time around, Argento goes to great lengths to make sure every murder scene is garishly filmed and staged to make the audience gasp.  The transfer to DVD is superb, and footage previously not released is now here for the first time in the USA.  Beautifully photographed, this movie set the precursor for the splatter films that would follow, including some by Dario Argento himself.

While both were very good films I would give Tenebrae a little bit of an edge for a couple reasons.  First, although I like stories that slowly develop and lead to an explosive climax, Deep Red moved a little too slowly in some parts, very slow I should say.  Second, I liked the ending of Tenebrae better, not to say that Deep Red's ending wasn't good but I just thought Tenebrae's ending was just awesome.  I will say one thing that I am learning about Argento, that he is an expert director.  His movies are an excellent combination of horror and mystery, imaginative camerawork, and a pulse raising soundtrack.  Another thing was that I was unable to guess the killer in each movie.  Also, unlike some of today's thrillers, the motive behind the killer is perfectly logical and fits the rest of the movie like a puzzle.  You finish watching the movie feeling satisfied with what you saw just transpire.  I will say that Deep Red was a genuinely creepy and occasionally suspenseful movie that horror and mystery fans alike should take a look at.  If you can get past the dubbing problems, have a strong stomach, week supporting actors (by the way the acting in either film wasn't that bad, the main characters gave strong performances), you're in for a treat.  Just bear with the slow pace and you'll be happy you stick around for the ending of ""Deep Red"".

This is a film, as  is most Italian horror, that the jaded American film viewer should see, as  it opens up new arenas of terror and a unique presentation of it's subject.  Without a doubt, European horror is vastly different than the American  counterpart. ""Deep Red"", at it's core, is a murder-mystery, as is  most of Argento's films, and the story unfolds to reveal one macabre  incident after another.

[Profondo Rosso]

(Italy - 1975)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Techniscope)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

First released in the US in a re-edited version running a mere 100 minutes, Dario Argento's seminal psycho-thriller was quickly dismissed by critics as an incoherent  mess. European fans fared somewhat better - their version included five minutes of important exposition and character development, and restored all of the violence which had been trimmed from the American  print. The 105 minute version is a masterpiece, a whirlwind of horror unleashed by David Hemmings' investigation into the murder of his psychic neighbor (Macha Meril) by person or persons unknown. All the  elements of a classic Argento thriller are present: Eccentric  characterisations, outlandish plot twists, and a series of Grand Guignol  set-pieces which would set the standard for years to come.

The 126 minute Italian version is another matter altogether. Except for the extra material added to Hemmings' search of 'The House of the Screaming Child' (where an important clue is literally concealed in the  brickwork), none of the additional material adds anything truly significant to the film and simply slows the pace down to a crawl. Whereas the characters were once defined by their experiences, now they become bogged down in dialogue scenes which are allowed to ramble well beyond the point of no return. These shortcomings are amplified in the English version (which preserves Hemmings' distinctive voice and, by default, his terrific performance), where the additional scenes are presented in Italian with English subtitles, an unfortunate necessity which some viewers will find incredibly distracting. The Italian soundtrack is a much more satisfying experience, though it remains overlong and self-indulgent.

This was Argento's return to the giallo movie  following his disastrous detour into comedy (LE CINQUE GIORNATE), and the first time he was allowed to 'let rip' with cinematic abandon. The results are magnificent - camerawork, editing and  production design conspire to turn the convoluted script into a baroque masterwork which thrives on offbeat imagery and chilling use of music: The child's song which pre-empts the shocking murders; the heart-stopping moment when Hemmings catches a glimpse of Meril at her apartment window, screaming soundlessly as the killer advances on her from behind, a shot which is both horrific and profoundly humane at the same time; the crazy-surreal mannikin which appears from nowhere and 'confronts' a potential victim; and the climactic revelation when Hemmings slots the final piece of the puzzle into place, thereby revealing the killer's true identity. There's a wealth of equally stunning images in this extraordinary film, even if the 'definitive' Italian print reveals the tragic flaws in Argento's original vision. Look out for fine supporting performances, too, by Daria Nicolodi, Gabriele Lavia and Clara Calamai in pivotal roles.

One major caveat: DEEP RED contains one of the few questionable shots in Argento's entire filmography: The activities of a sadistic little girl are represented by a lizard with a needle driven through its body (for real). There's no excuse for it - Argento could have demonstrated the child's monstrous pathology in a thousand other ways, but he chose to go down this particular route. Sensitive viewers are duly warned.",958089600,5,3404,5.471374045801527

The video company that specializes in releasing underrated horror classics has finally continued their successful and well-deserved Dario Argento Collection with ""Deep  Red"", arguably Argento's best film (along with ""Suspiria"").  David Hemmings is a pianist who witnesses a murder and investigates the  crime, uncovering bloody childrens' drawings, an abandoned mansion, and a  haunting lullaby recording. Daria Nicolodi and Nicoletta Elmi co-star.  Anchor Bay's transfer is absolutely gorgeous, pristine with no scratches or  evidence of age. The sound is top-notch, save for a few signs of  over-recording the Goblin music. As the video box says, a lot of the uncut  footage in this Director's Cut was never intended for American release, so  never had an English vocal track recorded. Either that or the English  dialogue tracks have been lost. In any case, the change is obviously  noticable, but adds a European touch to the film and makes the Rome setting  more realistic. Of course some fans won't enjoy it, but this is the only  way to see ""Deep Red"" uncut. I disagree with the reviewer who  recommended buying the DVD and just viewing it completely in Italian with  English subtitles. The English dubbing is not haphazardly done and the  Italian dubbing of Hemmings' voice ruins his performance. At least with the  English/Italian version, 90% of his performance is in English. Make up your  mind which one you prefer, but either way, ""Deep Red"" is the most  ferociously stylish horror film to come onto video in a long time.

Although the blood and gore might look a little dated, Deep Red  contains some of the most brutal and inventive deaths of Argento's career,  combined with a relentlessly suspenseful and spooky atmosphere.  The theme  tune by Italian rock group Goblin is one of the most effective horror  themes of all time, combining a pulsating re-occuring bassline with a  child-like lullaby chant, and really adds to the atmosphere.

7894864,5,630580740X,"Dario Argentos Deep Red (Profondo Rosso) is something of a transitional work between his earlier, more standard giallo films and his more supernatural themed work of the late 70s and early 80s. Deep Red is still a giallo but introduces supernatural elements that are missing from his previous animal trilogy and which would be more fully explored in subsequent films such as Suspiria, Inferno and Phenomena.

While I consider Suspiria to be Argentos masterpiece, Deep Red comes a close second in terms of Argento films that I happily watch over and over again. Like many of Argentos other films, the acting can be stilted at times, and the characters are sometimes the architects of their own demises through their own stupidity (but that seems to be pretty common to horror movies in general).

As with Suspiria, the movie is sumptuously filmed, with beautiful locations, gory set-piece murders and a prowling camera providing unique POV shots which were Argentos signature at the time. It marks the beginning of what I considered to be Argentos best period, 1975 to 1987.

Where Deep Red stands above Suspiria and many of his later films is in the quality of its story. While Suspiria has the wispiest and most threadbare of plots, Deep Red benefits from an engaging whodunit storyline co-written by scriptwriter Bernandino Zapponi, perhaps best known for his collaborations with Federico Fellini.

The reveal of the killers identity is one of the best that I have seen. I had to rewind the movie (my first viewing was a rented VHS tape), just to make sure the director didn't cheat. He didnt, and the films audience was given the same big clue to the identity of the killer that the protagonist (Marcus) overlooked. I rank this movie and its twist ending right up there with Dont Look Now and The Sixth Sense.

This limited edition blu-ray is one that fans of Argento, giallo, Italian cinema and horror will want to own. The restoration is stunning in both quality of image and quality of sound. It is a far cry from previous grainy and washed out DVD editions that have come before it. It even shows some improvement in image quality over the previous excellent Blue Underground Blu-ray release.

It contains many archival special features that have come with previous editions, but also comes with an all new photo essay, beautiful packaging including postcard sized lobby cards, a booklet containing essays and a reversible fold out poster. This edition from Arrow is worthy of comparison to anything that the Criterion Collection puts out and will be a treasured addition to any horror hounds collection.",1523750400,3,2611,4.936218678815489
7894865,2,630580740X,"Psychic premonitions and murder go hand in hand in many movies. Deep Red seeks to capitalize on the idea and almost comes close to succeeding.  I was surprised that the movie doesn't deal with psychics nearly as much as it sounds like it will.  That's more like the jumping off point.

The psychic in question does too good a job at convincing people of her abilities, she's a liability to crooks who wish to remain anonymous.  When she gets a vision of a murder she herself becomes a murder victim  can't have her running around telling cops about her vision now can we?  Marcus, a neighbor and musician, catches a glimpse of the crime and becomes obsessed with solving the case, so he gets his own unofficial investigation going.  Aided (and hindered) by a pretty reporter (aren't cinematic reporters always pretty girls?  It's Lois Lane's fault!) Marcus, the pianist/would-be gumshoe/eye-witness, searches for clues in his scattered memory.

There is some good and some bad here.  While the acting has plenty of weak moments (none of the stars are familiar to me at all  it appears that they're all Italian), it's mostly fair.  There's some good interaction between the pair of amateur investigators, Marcus and his reporter friend.  This is offset by a very slow pace.  The story contains some revelations that aren't as clever as they seem to think they are. That's not to say it's a bad story overall, but none of the surprises are particularly gripping.  I think I saw an edited version so it's entirely possible that the full story fleshes out the plot revelations better.

The insert shots are poorly done.  A lot of these are looking into Marcus' memories or other visions.  Many of the edits are too abrupt which makes them feel jarring. This kills the flow that the slow pace has a hard enough time creating in the first place.

I think the worst element of this movie is just that it's forgettable. It made no strong impressions on me one way or another making it a struggle to remember details for review-writing purposes. So it might be mildly entertaining while it's on, but don't expect to spark a good discussion about it afterwards.  Again, though, this might not necessarily hold true for the unmolested version of the film since it does seem to have at least a small following of fans.

Content:
Its rated R, but at least in its cut down form thats a very mild R. Theres a little violence and blood (it sounds like the uncut version has more of that), some strong language, and mild sexuality.

DVD:
I got mine in a pack of 50 Chilling Classics. The audio in this version is generally fair but with an audio mix makes poor enough to make it hard to understand some of the dialogue. The video contains a little trash and is cut off at the edges but is otherwise tolerable. There are no extras at all.

There are at least a couple of editions that show every sign of being vastly superior to the one I have. Check out Blue Undergrounds DVD and Blu-ray options. If the movie is going to be worth watching, as many claim it is, its going to be the unmolested edit.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
Like I said, it's not so much bad as it is just forgettable, but I wouldn't mind seeing and judging a better print of the unedited film if I get the chance (without having to put any effort into it). If you're are Dario Argento fan definitely check it out but only in the uncut form. I cant give the edit I saw any better than 2*, but Ill reconsider that if I do ever see a better edition.",1523491200,,3488,4.508744038155803

7894868,5,630580740X,"Arrow Video has been doing an amazing job of offering the best transfers of the classic Dario Argento films that Ive ever seen. Not only have they compiled a strong amount of extras on each but the job of cleaning up the look of the films, the transfers involved and the images that have never looked better have made watching these films seem like Im seeing them for the first time. Such was the case with their new release of DEEP RED.

Starting with THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE in 1970 (which Arrow also released) Argento began his career with a groundbreaking giallo film that set the stage for all others to follow. For those who are unfamiliar, giallo films are usually murder thrillers, many based on the yellow covered paperbacks of the time and thus given the name giallo or yellow in Italian. The elements Argento used to great effect included a the killers point of view (POV), the killer wearing black gloves, more often than not using a knife or blade and a witness who was trying to solve the murders while placing themselves in danger at the same time. All of those have been repeated here in this film.

At a gathering in a theater psychic Helga Ulmann (Macha Meril) is on a panel giving a lecture. She is overtaken by images of someone in the audience, an unspeakable violent person she cant quite identify.

That same evening Marcus Daly (David Hemmings), a jazz pianist and instructor at a conservatory in Rome, is on his way home when he finds his friend Carlo (Gabriele Lavia) on the street in front of the bar, drunk. As the two begin to part ways they hear a scream. While Carlo departs, Marcus looks up to see his neighbor, Helga, being murdered and pushed onto the glass of her broken window. He rushes to save her but is too late. He hears a childs tune playing and see the murderer dressed in a brown raincoat leave but not enough to identify who it is.

The police arrive as does reporter Gianna Brezzi (Daria Nicolodi). Marcus feels like there is something he has forgotten, some clue, but is unable to remember what it might be. He and Gianna begin working together to try and solve the murder. When he hears the same music in his apartment one night, he foils the killer and calls Gianna over to help.

Talking to a friend of Ulmann they hear about a story involving the music he heard and has identified. Delving deeper he finds a book about a house that was supposedly haunted and a book written about it. Heading out to talk to the author before he can get there the killer shows and murders the author. When Marcus shows he now has to worry that the police will look at him as the prime suspect rather than someone who happened upon the scene of the crime.

With the help of Gianna Marcus discovers the area where the house may be located. He goes there to look the place over, now for sale, and to see if he can find any clues that might help them. He does indeed find another clue but not enough to identify the murderer. He informs Professor Giordani (Glauco Mauri), the parapsychologist who was with Helga onstage and has been helping him as well, of what happened and while visiting the crime scene Giordani finds another clue.

More murders occur, more suspects are added to the list and before the end of the film twists and turns will abound. Along the way Argento will twist and turn the minds of the viewer with enough suspense involved it would make Hitchcock jealous.

It is this ability to create suspense that put Argento into a class all his own. As you learn via the extras included on this disc, Argento found that the main character in film was not the actor displayed on screen but the camera itself. It shows in this film as he combines so many film making elements here in such a seamless fashion that you don't realize it until looking back at the entire film.

Argento uses a variety of camera angles for different reasons. His depiction of light and shadow used often in old black and white films but rarely when color came along it used to full effect. The composition of the shots he offers are tremendous to see. Most notable among these for me was a scene early on in the piazza where Marcus and Carlo talk at night. His use of framing and light make the image stand out in my mind.

This combination of story, as in the written word, and images as created by Argento makes for an entertaining and thrilling movie to view. Fans of Argento will love having the film in such a great condition. Those just discovering him for the first time will be impressed at what he accomplished at a time when the word CGI wasn't even known. Sadly, as is discussed in the films extras, many consider this the last of the great giallo films. While Argento still dabbled in them years later, most consider this his swan song to the genre.

As I said Id seen this film some time ago, I believe in VHS when it was released by Anchor Bay. Im guessing this was the American version of the film which was about 15 minutes or so shorter. The added footage was wasted on me since it had been so long since Id seen it. But the quality of the movie itself, how it appears on screen, was vastly improved. This cant just be due to the film being released on blu-ray instead of tape. It has a lot to do with the efforts of Arrow Video to insure a pristine version.

Not only are they providing the movie in such a great presentation (a 4k scan from the original negative) theyve added a number of extras that are more interesting to watch than most. To begin with you have the choice of the original version of the film or the exported version. The other extras include 6 postcard sized lobby card reproductions, reversible fold-out poster featuring two original artworks, a reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Gilles Vranckx, a limited edition booklet featuring new writing on the film by Mikel J. Koven and an archival essay by Alan Jones, an audio commentary track by Argento expert Thomas Rostock, PROFONDO GIALLO a visual essay by Michael Mackenzie, ROSSO RECOLLECTIONS: DARIO ARGENTOS DEEP GENIUS featuring a discussion with Argento, THE LADY IN RED: DARIA NICOLODI REMEMBERS PROFONDO ROSSO (the Italian name of the film), MUSIC TO MURDER FOR composer Claudio Simonetti on DEEP RED, PROFONDO ROSSO: FROM CELLULOID TO SHOP a tour of the Profondo Rosso shop in Rome with Argento collaborator Luigi Cozzi, the Italian theatrical trailer and the US trailer. If the movie itself did not make the purchase of this film the extras do.

The past few years with the help of Arrow Video fans and those just now becoming familiar with the Italian giallo film have finally had access to some of the best that was ever committed to celluloid. One can only hope that they continue to do so. As long as they do they will remain the best company there is at offering these films in the best way possible. Lets just hope they continue to do so.",1522540800,,6903,4.4952153110047846
7894869,5,630580740X,"This was a big movie for Argentina. One of his best, as long as it isn't one of the cut up version.
This one is uncut and it has the uncut Italian version as well.",1522454400,,163,3.6857142857142855
7894870,5,630580740X,"With the release of his fifth feature film, Deep Red (1975), Dario Argento was probably starting to believe his own hype.  As the Italian Hitchcock, hed proven himself a bankable director of international thrillers (and one obscure Western) whod inspired hundreds of imitators in his own country and abroad.  The competition was getting fierce.  So Argento fired off one last salvo into the crowded giallo genre that would end the debates and put him firmly back on top.

Deep Red is one of those films that catch a director working at the top of his game working with deceptive ease.  David Hemmings, in a variation of his role in Blow Up, is the witness to a brutal crime who believes he saw a vital clue to the killers identitybut cant quite recall the evidence of his own eyes.  With the help of a nosy reporter (possible killer #1) and a fellow musician (possible killer #2), Hemmings stays one step ahead of a string of vicious murders that target anyone involved in the crime.  Unlike many giallos to follow (even Argentos) the plot of Deep Red actually makes sense and serves as a template for Italian filmmakers in the second half of the decade.  Starting with a creepy childhood flashback (with equally creepy music to match from Goblin), several operatic murder sequences punctuated by Argentos unmatched visual flourishes, the film is exactly what the director set out to create: a giallo to end all giallos.",1521504000,,1420,4.790983606557377
