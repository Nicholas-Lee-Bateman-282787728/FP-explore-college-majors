Instead, this DVD shows various Louis Armstrong performances. Given the selections and their quality, it is likely that  these are public domain performances. First off, it's Sachmo, so it's all glorious. Second, most of these performances can be found elsewhere in better form. While the audio quality is generally good, it's a joke that there's an option for 5.1 surround sound. Beyond this, the real issue is that the video quality is poor. No attempt was made to remaster the picture. Fortunately, the song selection is golden. Long past his time with the Hot Five and Seven, ""The Louis Armstrong Show"" plays the songs that are regarded as Pops' contemporary hits. This DVD shuffles live songs from about four different sources. Things start off with 'Hello Dolly.' Filmed in black and white, it is performed in front of troops. Next is '(I'll Be Glad When You're Dead) You Rascal You.' From the 1932 film, ""A Rhapsody in Black and Blue,"" it is a memorable scene that shows Louis Armstrong singing in a leopard skin amidst flowing bubbles. It is followed by 'Someday,' which was recorded at the Goodyear Jazz TV Concert in 1962. The memorable color footage was recorded in front of a large globe. Better quality footage of this performance can be seen on the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Louis-Armstrong-Greatest-Performances-of-the-30s-40s-50s-and-60s/dp/B0017CW5I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Louis Armstrong: Greatest Performances of the '30s,'40s, '50s, and '60s</a>"" DVD as well as YouTube. Next up is a 1942 black and white performance of 'Sleepy Time Down South.' Afterwards, we revisit the Goodyear Concert for Jewel Brown's 'Jerry' which would have been a great tune were it not for repetitive number of choruses. Following the natural flow of the performance, Sachmo sings 'Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen.' This block of footage ends with 'When the Saints Go Marching In.' On this song, Jewel Brown's vocal talents enhance the New Orleans favorite to make for a memorable retelling. After the 1962 footage, we jump back to 1942 for a musical video of 'Shine.' We return yet again to the 1962 Goodyear performance for 'C'est si bon.' Like a bookend, we finish with the DVD's initial military event for a reprise of 'Hello Dolly.' On ""The Louis Armstrong Show,"" Sachmo is always in top form. The issue here isn't the brilliance of Pops but the poor video quality of the selections. The availability of better footage encourages the potential buyer to look elsewhere.
