3847979,5,B0024WVOX4,"Dr. Yang once again presents a first class demonstration of the martial arts. This time Dr Yang teaches the art of seizing the opponent in varied moves so the opponent can be controlled and limited in his actions. The instruction is definitive and easy to follow.

This video is for the serious student of Tai Chi and its fighting and defensive techniques. This is an excellent exercise for the student of Shaolin Push Hands style. However, any practitioner of Tai Chi can profit from this DVD.

Dr. Yang instructs in his usual comfortable manner but what I particulary like is that he allows his student models to commit errors and he immediately corrects these mistakes. As opposed to other instuctional videos, Dr. Yang does not assume that one showing of a move is sufficient for the student. He also explains that variations, i.e. sweaty hands, etc., can change the rules of the game. I seem to learn more from watching someone's mistakes being corrected rather than to just go on to the next movement.

This being a two DVD, on the second video,  Dr. Yang demonstrates all 80 movements in slow motion first then at normal speed. Watching the Master perform is incentive enough to return to Disc 1 to learn the art of seizure.",1245801600,2,1231,4.711627906976744
3847980,5,B0024WVOX4,"Review of the 2 DVD Set ""Taiji Chin Na In Depth: The Seizing Art of Taijiquan"" by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming.

With this DVD set you can learn to control any opponent with simple, powerful joint locks as demonstrated by Dr. Wang.

The background of Chin Na (Qin Na) is that it is the art of seizing and controlling an opponent. It purports to be a fast, effective way to subdue an attacker using joint locks, cavity press, bone misplacement, muscle grabbing, and artery sealing. Taijiquan, by comparison, is a traditional martial art, and Chin Na is an important part of your complete Taiji (Tai Chi) training. Taiji Chin Na are smooth, flowing techniques that are simple to execute and difficult to escape.

Dr. Yang discusses, demonstrates, and teaches you his Chin Na techniques up-close and in detail. All these techniques are hidden inside the Yang style postures, but can be applied to all Taiji styles.  I have found that Yang's course is explained well and demonstrated to the point of allowing easy simulation by a new practitioner to Taiji Chin Na.  Once the viewer walks through the video the relationship to Tai Chi becomes clear.

The contents of Yang's DVD are as follows:

DVD One:

Course One: 19 techniques from the Eight Moving Patterns, and Clockwise Coiling in Crossed Pushing Hands.

Course Two: 16 techniques from the Eight Moving Patterns including Rotating Neutralizing, and Counterclockwise Coiling in Crossed Pushing Hands.

Course Three: 21 techniques from the Eight Moving Patterns, and Parallel Pushing Hands.

DVD Two:

Course Four: 10 techniques specifically for countering an opponent controlling your elbow in Pushing Hands.

DVD Two also includes a bonus video with Dr. Yang demonstrating 80 Taiji Chin Na techniques in slow motion and at full speed, categorized by the Eight Basic Taiji Patterns (Eight Doors) and chin na found in pushing hands. These techniques can be found in the popular book Taiji Chin Na.

Well done!",1244937600,3,1951,5.0
3847981,5,B0024WVOX4,"This DVD set is one of the best martial arts instruction videos I've ever seen. I've had Dr. Yang's book on the topic of Chin Na since I was in high school, and now nearly 20 years later, I've finally seen the sifu in action, and it was well worth the wait.

Each technique is explained in depth with a verbal description of what each joint is doing as you watch the action taking place. Dr. Yang starts with the fundamentals of wrist movements and how they are used to defend yourself while incapactitating an attacker. Every chapter that follows in the DVD set builds on what was taught in the previous chapter until in the end, the student is using a complex wrist/elbow lock accompanied by a choke hold.

There are literally hundreds of locks and grappling moves explained, described, and demonstrated on this 2-disc set. That is more than enough to get a would-be attacker on his knees and in submission through any number of combinations.

I particularly enjoyed the sequences in the bonus video where Dr. Yang demonstrates several sequences of hand-to-hand combat giving all the previous training a definite air of practicality.

This video has made a wonderful addition to my martial arts training.",1243728000,14,1206,4.783653846153846

Disc One contains three courses. Together the courses demonstrate many joint locks starting from a push hand scenario.

Disc Two contains two programs. The first contains 10 techniques specifically for countering an opponent who is controlling your elbow in pushing hands.  The remainder of the disk is a bonus program that consists of a catalog of over 80 taiji chin na techniques.

3847990,5,B0024WVOX4,"Encyclopedic was the first word that came to mind in viewing this dvd. Indeed, that's probably the best way to get the most out of this resource--treat it like an encyclopedia and, by means of the handy dvd menus, examine the ""entries"" as you have time, ability, and a willing training partner.

This disc contains, in essence, a six-hour seminar that systematically moves through a huge number of chin na techniques. Dr Yang performs a technique, then critiques two students attempting it. His directions and adjustments contain additional insight into how and when the technique would be applied. Like all of the YMAA dvds I've viewed, the camera angles and positioning of the students is great, providing a clear view of exactly what's going on.

This set will be most helpful for advanced students who have a good amount of experience with push-hands. Taking a few of these at a time and working them into your training until you're comfortable with them, then heading back for a few more, would be an excellent way to begin working these into your repertoire of taichi chin na techniques.",1271808000,2,1093,4.870967741935484
3847991,5,B0024WVOX4,"As with all of the Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming's work that I have purchased or had the opportunity to preview, this is an excellent instruction video for the advanced martial arts student. Dr. Yang is able to present a depth of information without wasting words. So many martial arts' videos come across as a version of ""Simon Says"", but Dr. Yang takes time to explain the joint and body movements involved. I was particularly impressed with Dr. Yang's explanation of typical problems that students face; it made it feel more like actually being in a live class.",1265846400,,554,4.78125
3847992,5,B0024WVOX4,"After watching ""Taiji Chin Na In Depth: The Seizing Art of Taijiquan"" with Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming, the first thing that comes to mind is ""WOW!""  The amount of information and instruction contained in this two-disc set is phenomenal.  Originally the information was presented on five videos, now you can have all five on two discs with over six hours of instruction.  With the menu system on the DVD, it is very easy to select the portion of the program you wish to study, making these even better resources than video tape.

The format of the instruction is very good.  First, Dr. Yang teaches the technique, and he does so with more detail than you find in some programs, which I really like.  I've always liked video programs where the instructor teaches to the camera rather than just demonstrating.  Dr. Yang teaches in this program.  He then brings in two students and allows them to do the technique and he corrects them when they don't perform it just right.  Dr. Yang explains that the problems his students have might be the same as the viewer, and by helping them, he'll help the viewer too.  I believe it is a very good way to present the material on DVD.  As an added feature, there are subtitles across the bottom of the screen.  However, they do not match what Dr. Yang is saying exactly.  They convey the meaning, but are not exact.  The person who really wants to learn will spend many hours watching portions of this program at a time with a training partner and practicing the techniques Dr. Yang presents.

Disc One contains three programs or courses.  The first course focuses on 19 techniques from the same beginning clockwise coiling move.  The techniques are initiated from a crossed pushing hands position and consist of techniques that attack various joints, including the elbow, wrist, fingers, and shoulder.  The second course on this disc is presented the same, initiating techniques from the crossed pushing hands position, but the neutralizing portion is different.  Dr. Yang shows what he calls neutralizing that goes into some finger locks, and then the counterclockwise coiling moves that go into various locks.  There are 16 techniques taught in the course two portion of the DVD.  Course three on this disc focuses on the parallel hands position in pushing hands.  Dr. Yang teaches 21 techniques from this position.  The first disc also contains the YMAA extras that include About YMAA, the Catalog, Video Previews, and DVD Credits.

Disc Two contains two programs.  The first is course four of the original four-course program.  This course contains 10 techniques specifically for countering an opponent who is controlling your elbow in pushing hands.  Dr. Yang continues his detailed instruction and then assisting his students performing the techniques.  The remainder of disc one is a bonus program that consists of a catalog of over 80 taiji chin na techniques.  There is no instruction in this portion, just the demonstration of techniques in slow motion and regular speed.  This was a video made to compliment the book ""Taiji Chin Na"" and would be more useful with that written volume.  While a beginner would not be able to learn the techniques by just watching Dr. Yang perform them, an experienced student of joint locks will recognize techniques and could add to his or her arsenal.  The second disc also contains the YMAA extras.

For anyone who does pushing hands, this DVD set is a must.  It is an excellent resource aimed directly at Taiji Pushing Hands practice.  For those interested in improving their Chin Na or joint locking expertise, this is also a fantastic resource.  YMAA rates this DVD at a skill level III.  I agree that these are not simple techniques to learn, but I do believe if a person has a good training partner and follows Dr. Yang's instruction, they could learn a lot.  Obviously, if you have mastered the basics of movement and joint locks, this resource will be easier to follow and you can then ""feel"" the techniques.  I primarily train in and teach Hapkido, another art known for joint locks, so I found much of the information in these discs to be complementary to my own style.

Regardless of your style, if you want to gain a better understanding of locking techniques, Dr. Yang's instructional DVDs on Chin Na are great.  I highly recommend this set and his others.

3847993,5,B0024WVOX4,"If you already own the VHS tapes from this series, the DVDs are well worth obtaining.  On DVD 2 Bonus material is presented with Master Yang demonstrating over 80 Taiji Chin Na techniques in slow motion and at full speed.  He categorizes these moves by the Eight Doors and Chin Na found in pushing hands.  This bonus material was not on the original VHS tapes of this series.

The title, which includes the words ""IN DEPTH"", tells it all.  This series goes much deeper than other material I have seen from YMAA on the Taiji style of the seizing art of Chin Na.  As many practitioners are aware, Taijiquan has numerous Chin Na applications throughout the form.  Taijiquan is especially suited for Chin Na applications as the yielding and softness that precede the final application of Taijiquan is usually soft and misleading to the other person.  This is a perfect set up for applying a Chin Na technique.

Chin Na applications are more effectively and successfully performed when the practitioner is able to establish the proper hold.  If a person tries to apply a Chin Na technique with too much initial force, then the person receiving the technique is alerted and with understanding can more easily evade the Chin Na technique.  Taijiquan can lead to a very well grounded Chin Na technique that is difficult to discern until one is completely under it's power.

Yang, Jwing-Ming is involved in the teaching throughout the series.  Pascal and Julien, two students of Dr. Yang who were involved in demonstrating the Yang Style 2 man fighting set DVD, are two of the ""victims"" and demonstrators on this tape.  The other is Tony Chee.  I would imagine that anyone who studies with Dr. Yang would be knowledgeable in how to neutralize the effects of a Chin Na technique.  Yet, when you see the effect of Dr. Yang's techniques on these students, it only makes one even more aware of just how powerful and effective Dr. Yang's techniques are when applied to someone with neutralizing knowledge, much less a beginner.  At times, the students are able to obtain fairly effective results while demonstrating the Chin Na on each other.  Yet, the difference is obvious when Dr. Yang shows the correct way for applying the techniques.

The applications and techniques are linked in a very believable manner to the postures in the Taiji form.  When the hidden Chin Na techniques in the Yang style Taijiquan form are are shown, there can be no doubt that these Chin Na techniques truly represent the many possible applications that exist in Taijiquan.  Many people think of Chin Na as a separate martial art, never realizing that many Chin Na techniques are a part of the majority of Taijiquan and Kung Fu styles.

Dr. Yang shows the correct set up for each move and explains why each part of the technique is performed as shown.  Many teachers can display a technique and they can apply a technique, but few can explain how and why the technique works.  Dr. Yang is one of the few who shows true knowledge and understanding of the techniques and applications that he presents.

One caution, a viewer will see Dr. Yang apparently continuing the technique even when the students are slapping their hand on their leg , which is generally understood as meaning they have submitted.  Unless one is very skilled at controlling the power being used, never continue the technique once your training partner taps out.  As you each become more skilled and better able to judge your skill, then you will be able to still hold the technique but lessen the pressure enough to avoid injury with your partner.  Always work out clear signals on what means stop, or what means don't go any farther.

Bonus material is presented with Master Yang demonstrating over 80 Taiji Chin Na techniques in slow motion and at full speed.  He categorizes these moves by the Eight Doors and Chin Na found in pushing hands.  This bonus material was not on the original VHS tapes of this series.

Anyone interested in the fighting techniques of Taijiquan or who has studied Chin Na in other systems will enjoy and learn much from this series of Taiji Chin Na applications.  The techniques and applications so clearly presented on this DVD series offer a very effective self defense system to the practitioner.",1251331200,11,5048,4.892941176470588
3847994,5,B0024WVOX4,"I was a bit concerned when I received the DVD because I am a tai chi amateur practitioner and this DVD was rated as level 3. I didn't know how I would react to the instructions.

I believe that the beginner will struggle a bit at the beginning but quite soon, I am confident, with a bit of perseverance, every one will gain a lot from this DVD.

The movements are explains clearly and slowly and, especially with the help of the subtitles, I had the greatest chance ever - learn TaiChi Na in my living room. It is a remarkable set of instructions. The fact that the three parts come in one set is even better!

Other reviewers have taken time to explain what is TaiChi Na and what is contained on the DVDs so I will not do that.

What I can share is that this set of instruction is challenging but effective. As a beginner I have learned A LOT and I know that I will return again to the set when I advance a bit more.

Warning: this set does not contain any special effects and dazzling soundtrack. It focuses entirely on the instruction. While the entertaining levels are low, what I want from my money is instruction. And that's what is on this Set.",1250640000,5,1151,4.237442922374429
3847995,5,B0024WVOX4,"On this DVD, Dr. Yang Jwing Ming presents a systematic approach to Taijiquan's Chin-na. He classifies it into clockwise, counter-clockwise, and forward neutralizing movements, bringing much needed clarity and simplification to a somewhat complex set of movements. Overall, this is a very well organized and clearly structured DVD with a clear set of step by step instructions following a logical order.

The Chin-na movements and locks are explained in great detail. You get to see these movements performed on a student, and the students perform the movements on each other. This is a great idea, as it allows Dr. Yang to point out the various mistakes which beginners tend to make. He points out crucial anatomical areas, explaining how to manipulate them properly to maximize the effect of each lock or break. You get applications in almost every element of Taijiquan: from push-hand, to various Taiji movements.

The only down side that I could find, is that some of these movements may not apply on fully resisting opponents. However, these are far in between. The vast majority of techniques are effective and quite painful to experience. Overall, another great product by YMMA publishing. I highly recommend this to intermediate to advanced students of Taijiquan who either need a refresher, or the students looking to add martial elements which may be lacking in their training.",1250553600,3,1386,5.183035714285714
3847996,5,B0024WVOX4,"The title for this review came from Dr. Yang himself.  He was giving advice to all who study the Chin Na techniques included on this set of DVD's.  There certainly is no shortage of techniques to ""practice,"" that's for sure.  There is enough in this set to work on for YEARS--and that's just performing the moves as demonstrated!  Then you add in the ""ponder"" part.  Dr. Yang wants you to THINK about each move, ""reverse engineer"" it if you will, to find the variations that will work best with your body type, your temperament, your skill level.  Bottom line:  can you make it work?

A comment on the teaching methodology:  I really liked the way Dr. Yang would first demonstrate a Chin Na technique in detail on one of his students, then have that student try the move on another student.  He would then critique and correct the performance by the student and have him repeat it until he had at least a basic understanding of it.  In this way, as the student learned the technique, so did I--and so will YOU!

I was glad Dr. Yang included the Bonus footage he did.  But I wasn't sure WHY he did it at first.  This footage was taken from an older Taiji Chin Na VHS tape that was produced in the mid 1990's.  Now as to why Dr. Yang would include this archival footage.  I think, perhaps, Dr. Yang wants the viewer to reinterpret this older material with the new ""glasses"" he has provided you with in all the preceding ""In Depth"" material--more to ""ponder""?!

Whether you are new to Chin Na, or you are an experienced Chin Na practitioner who just wants to ""up your game"", I would venture to say that there are probably no finer Chin Na DVD's on the market today.  If you have been contemplating  purchasing these DVD's--do  not hesitate--you will pat yourself on the back later for doing so.  An investment in yourself is always a wise decision.",1250294400,2,1845,4.48048048048048
3847997,5,B0024WVOX4,"This DVD includes over 6 HOURS of advanced tai chi applications, many if not all of which have never been published outside of Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming and the YMAA organization.  Clearly Dr. Yang has invested an immense amount of time into identifying, understanding, and perfecting the techniques presented.  Techniques are presented from Eight Moving Patterns, Clockwise and Counterclockwise Coiling, Crossed Pushing Hands, Parallel Pushing Hands and more.  It only makes sense therefore that viewers should be familiar with these concepts to gain full advantage of the techniques presented.

Interested viewers should also be familiar with Chin Na techniques such as locking joints, splitting muscle/tendons, and pressure point manipulation. All of these techniques are required in order for the applications to be effective, however these concepts are not discussed in this video.  I also noticed Dr. Yang manipulating pressure points in some techniques without drawing the viewer's attention to these fine details.

As a practicing martial artist of over a decade and instructor familiar with several tai chi chuan styles and applications, I found this video to be a phenomenal resource and one that is truly amazing in content and knowledge.  This DVD provides almost an inexhaustible supply of applications, most of which are not typical.  I say ""not typical"" in that these are not the punching, kicking, or throwing responses which are more common tai chi chuan applications, but instead Dr. Yang is solely focused on presenting joint locks and controlling your opponent.  Many techniques require a full understanding of tai chi movements and common postures.  Many of the applications may require the practitioner to deviate from more stationary footwork.  For example, posture applications such as one from the Yang style 24-form posture ""strike both ears/doubly box the ears/box the ears"" are not performed in the familiar footwork that is found in the kata, rather requires stepping that deviates from the form.  Some martial arts practitioners will be used to this concept from extracting and applying techniques from kata, however I know many students which may be confused by the ""atypical"" footwork.  And who would have thought that ""box the ears"" can turn into a opponent-controlling hold?

Certainly not for beginners, YMAA gives this DVD a Recommended Skill Level of III.  I would almost offer an even higher possible skill level of IV.  However, for the serious tai chi practitioner or instructor who has a firm grasp on both chin na and Yang-style tai chi chuan fundamentals, this DVD is well worth the cost.",1249171200,6,2626,5.306763285024155
3847998,5,B0024WVOX4,"There is large, but sometimes unseen difference in the way Chin Na is applied in Tai Chi, as opposed to other arts. Dr. Yang goes into great detail about why and how. By using students who are new to Chin Na, he is able to show problems that most beginners, and even experience practitioners face. The teaching session portion is worth owning if you are a teacher also, it give good ideas on how to explain problem areas. He spends a lot of time demonstrating and explaining things in a way that most everyone can understand. A True Masterpiece!

I'v had the priveledge to meet Dr. Yang several times over the past 20 years. His teaching ability is genuine and so is his desire for students to learn. I have been teaching internal arts for about 12 years now, and I can honestly say that this is the BEST Chin Na DVD out there, in my opinion.

Brilliant Instruction!!!

Dr. Yang is a Master Martial Artist and a Master Instructor!  His instruction is wonderfully concise. His demonstration: clear and accurate.  He conveys to you the perfected motion(the goal you want to achieve), while at the same time he is cognizant that there are students of various levels of experience watching this video.

 After several demonstrations of the same technique (from different angles, when necessary) Dr. Yang allows his students to, then, demonstrate the very same technique. Bringing their level of experience to the situation.  Bringing their level of mistakes to the techniques being taught.  -Probably a mistake you, yourself, are making- This allows Dr. Yang to correct the mistake, thereby deeply anchoring the movement into your skill set.

This is not a polished studio production with fancy lighting and special effects (nor, any of that damnable Chinese guitar twanging away consistently in the back ground).  This is a real time classroom atmosphere, and you are drawn in.  Your attention captured, your mind focused on the lesson at hand.
