8419832,5,630365407X,"When I first viewed this tape, my feeling was that it was another weight training video geared solely toward women.  It looked too easy.  Even though I had not worked out in quite sometime, I thought it would not benefit me.  I was wrong.  When I actually did it, I found it challenging for a beginner.  Also, because the exercises are done with hand weights, one can always increase the weight to add to the difficulty.

The emphasis is on strict form and proper body alignment which is very helpful. It's surprising how sloppy one can become when you don't stay focused.  You are continually reminded how to do the exercises properly.

Supersets are used with two or three exercises done in combination.  Diet tips are given at the end of the tape.

All in all, a solid basic workout for the beginner which should yield good results if done consistently.",1145836800,2,856,4.6092715231788075
