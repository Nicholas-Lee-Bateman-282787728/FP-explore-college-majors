I watched it with my two daughters, 11 and 8, and it was an embarrassment.

There are 2 rapes, in which the women yell in pain.

There are about 35 murders with knives. The scenes are not very bloody, but it is still terrible to see a bunch of lunatics killing dozens of people. My 11 year old was so sickened that she left the room.

There's is a fairly explicit sex scene with a prostitute, which ends up being an incest.

There's frequent reference to prostitutes and to man going to bed with women.

Potiphar's wife behaves in a few scenes as in an x rated movie, her face shows extreme sexual desire, she touches Joseph in very explicit way, including touching his penis. The scene does not show sexual parts of course, but her hand goes down pretty deep. She invites him to sleep with her a few times.

There are several extremely offensive references to women, like ""they talk to much"" or ""they gossip.""

Again, the movie is okay and the sex scenes did not offend me. My problem is that the movie is not rated and it should be at least PG13. I wish I had not watched that movie with my two daughters. I am upset.",1471564800,,1284,4.343096234309623
