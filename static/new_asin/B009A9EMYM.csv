5295940,5,B009A9EMYM,"Having purchased all the other movies in the Love Comes Softly series, I could not pass this one up.  Even though the character of Elle was not in the other movies (only in the books) I embraced it anyway.  I knew it would be a tearjerker as were the others and that's what makes a movie worth watching!  The story about Elle loosing her husband and child and coming to stay with brother Aaron was good and the subplots regarding the romance between Aaron's farm help and the Mayor's daughter were good, but what really had me going was when Aaron was hurt and the help he received in getting home again was really good.  Without giving too much away, I was reminded of a Little House on the Prairie episode where Laura runs away and meets up with a hermit, also played by Ernest Borgnine, and it's implied this hermit is God and is helping her.  I liked the way they sort of resurrected that same type of character here.",1353369600,,921,4.362573099415204
5295941,5,B009A9EMYM,"As with all the other Love sagas, this one is great. Saw it last year on Hallmark. Had to have it.",1353283200,,98,3.7142857142857144
5295942,4,B009A9EMYM,"Was very happy with this dvd. Movie was O.K. but think they have wandered too far from the original story. Delivery was fast, product was packed well.",1352764800,,150,4.592592592592593
5295943,2,B009A9EMYM,"Loved every single one of the Love Softly DVD series.  Watch them over and over again.  There is so much inspiration in all of them.

This one does not hold a candle to any of those.  Even though it goes back in time and follows Missy's stepbrother and their younger sister, Ellie, it doesn't follow with the other movies at all.

It is a corny movie without inspirational themes to it like all the other movies.  Not only is it corny but it is so predictable throughout.  If you can figure out the whole movie at every scene, it doesn't allow the viewer to appreciate what is going to happen in the story.  I really missed Michael Landon, Jr.  He was the one who made the other movies my favorites.

Give it a chance....but still enjoyed all the others much more.",1352246400,7,764,4.3546099290780145
5295944,5,B009A9EMYM,I've enjoyed this whole series its kind of nice to see where and how it all started.  This time period has always been fascinating to me.,1351987200,,137,4.269230769230769
5295945,5,B009A9EMYM,I'm waiting on my DVD but am confused by the description of this new movie.  Ellie is getting over the loss of her family?  Ellie died in the other movie.  So where does this fall in the timeline?  Before she married Clark or does this movie not have anything to do with the other movies?,1351987200,,288,4.181818181818182
5295946,5,B009A9EMYM,"This series is great family viewing.  I have all of them.  The acting casts are great.  What I like best is that there are often ""life lessons"" given for the viewers to think on.",1351814400,,178,4.176470588235294
5295947,5,B009A9EMYM,"My wife (and thereby I as well as I am a supportive husband) have seen all of the Love's Journey movies. With this in mind I have seen them move and grow with the characters, with some of the movies being stronger than others. This installment was a strong one, with two installments, this is one that will keep you engrossed from beginning to end. What my wife loves about this episode is that you truly get to see the strong bond of the family and how the power of family, friendship and love will pull this family through everything. While there are moments that are a bit corny (or cheesy as I would put it) in some of the romantic message that is shared, you come to expect that in these films. Yet, in the end, this and all of the movies from this series are warm, family friendly movies that have positive messages that the whole family can enjoy!",1351641600,44,854,4.3105590062111805
5295948,4,B009A9EMYM,"Love's Christmas Journey is a new two-part, four-hour journey Love Comes Softly fans won't want to miss! While the two new prequels that aired back in September and October [2011] on Hallmark Channel (Love Begins and Love's Everlasting Courage) were sweet, they really were lacking a certain depth and quality that made the first few movies of the series great. With the last two additions being rather disappointing, I wasn't expecting too much with this latest, much longer movie. I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised!

As more movies kept being added on to the series, I thought it was sad not to learn more about Missy's brothers (introduced in Love Comes Softly and Love's Enduring Promise). They simply seemed to vanish, even when Clark and Marty (Missy's father and stepmother) still came back off and on throughout the first six movies. I was so excited to learn that Love's Christmas Journey brought back Aaron (Missy's younger stepbrother)! And not only Aaron, but a yet-to-be-introduced younger sister named Ellie, who has a heartbreaking but ultimately hopeful story of her own.

There are so many wonderful surprises in this movie! The length definitely helps to give the characters more time to face challenges and grow. The overall quality is much better than the prequels (as well as the seventh and eighth movies), despite a little bit of lingering romantic (etc.) corniness, which can be cute, albeit awkward, sometimes! (And speaking of awkward, there's one falling scene near the beginning that is pretty out-of-the-blue, providing a laugh-out-loud moment.)

Yes, there is a bit of cheesy acting, which isn't so bad in a feel-good Christmas movie. But overall the acting is very good! I love that Sean Astin (of Lord of the Rings fame - Samwise Gamgee!) is the mayor!! And I knew a certain man in town looked familiar... Mr. Cunningham is none other than the actor (Stephen Bridgewater) who played Mr. Taylorson in Love's Long Journey and Love's Abiding Joy! How fun is that??

This movie packs an emotional punch, then wraps up the hurting in a great big group hug and a pretty red bow. And I enjoyed every minute! There's some Wild West-fighting tension that made me cringe and cry out, some adorable children scenes, and some romantic moments that made me go ""Awww!"" and smile. Love Comes Softly fans will recognize much of the background music, as well as a few references to Clark and Marty. With themes of justice, generosity, and hope, this is a great Christmas romantic Western to watch with your girl friends or family this season.

*NOTE: This review was originally posted on my blog and includes my initial reactions to seeing the show on TV. Due to the lack of commercials, I believe the DVD version will be shorter than 4 hours. Now that the movie is finally being released (a year later), I'm excited to have the chance to watch it again this Christmas season!*",1349827200,143,2911,4.860887096774194
5295949,5,B009A9EMYM,"Okay.  I love all the ""Loves..."" movies.  But this one is my favorite of all of them, not just because it's set at Christmas.  The leading male characters in these movies are always hot and this one is no exception.  But I just loved the interaction between Nicholas (Earnest Borgnine) and Aaron (Greg Vaughan).  This is a really sweet feel good movie that I enjoyed watching during the Holiday Season.",1348963200,49,402,4.685714285714286

5296013,1,B009A9EMYM,"This is arguably about the stupidest movie we've ever endured. Having loved the first couple movies in the Love Come Softly series, we were astonished at this episode's departure from genuine Christian faith and deep lessons in godly love. This profound and valuable undergirding was replaced with a little slapping on of Christian-eze words here and there and ultimately hoodwinked into St. Nick himself being the savior, the one who answers prayer. Kid you not.

The characters were absolutely clueless people; they moved about like drugged out, hypnotized, one-dimensional people incapable of complex thought - or logical behavior. They cared more about 'feelings' than reality. For instance, while the sheriff lay dying in the wilderness, the men folk organized a posse to rehang the downtown holiday decorations damaged by a storm. Then, just when it couldn't get more unreal, Miracle on 34th Street met the prairie, as Santa rescued dad and even caused a snowfall.

After lots of good laughs and many concerns (a miss-behaving nine year old is reminded children don't eat hay, Wild West children do odd things like eat poison berries with abandon and learn at a late stage how to sand small pieces of wood ... ), we're destroying our copy. No one should watch such spiritual confusion and emotionally skewed material.

Ever.",1482624000,,1330,5.119815668202765
5296014,1,B009A9EMYM,"I do NOT like movies that have magical, mystical, angels, or 'Nicholas'. The story and acting was fairly poor, but one could have tolerated it if it had a logistic point and hadn't had the 'angel' or magical saint Nick that appears at the last and magically rescues the hero! I'm sorry, I don't mind realistic feel good story lines occasionally, but magical appearances of 'angel' type humans that do good that magically disappear when all is well is ridiculous. I was trying to be careful NOT to get any of these when I ordered some Christmas videos for the whole family. This one was extremely disappointing.

5296053,5,B009A9EMYM,"An unexpected pleasure to watch during the Christmas Season. The film is probably a bit predictable at times, however it is a pleasure to find a wholesome family film that isn't full of commercialism, sex, greed or the other ""ingredients"" that seem to make the films of today popular.",1455753600,,284,4.816326530612245

5296063,4,B009A9EMYM,This is a very nice story in keeping with the tradition of the Love Comes Softly Series.  The only issue I had with this story is the mix of belief in God to strengthen the main male character in a time of crisis; but the appearance of Santa Claus (St. Nick) in another.  Other than that I loved the story.,1452988800,,306,4.083333333333333

5296067,1,B009A9EMYM,"I love Janette Oke's books and Christmas movies, and I had looked forward to watching this one this year. I've liked the movies I've seen of Ms. Oke's books - they're not Academy Award material, but they're sweet and pleasant films . This one, though, was pitiful. The story was weak, the events implausible, and the acting unremarkable. I don't know if this was based on an actual book of Ms. Oke's or, if it was, how closely it followed the story, but I was disgusted that I'd wasted 90 minutes or so on this film.",1451606400,,516,4.385416666666667
5296068,5,B009A9EMYM,Great movie!  It has enough of a plot that it could be watched anytime of the year not just at Christmas time.  Sometimes it is hard to find good wholesome movies.  It is two parts and a little long for some to watch in one sitting as it was close to 3 hours.,1451433600,,259,3.849056603773585

5296180,4,B009A9EMYM,"This is a wholesome family Christmas movie, and for that I give it a solid four stars.  The one aspect that I found continually off-putting, however, is the excessive use of makeup on every adult actress in the film.  We're bombarded with bright lips, thick eye-liner, and heavy mascara over fake lashes.  As we all know, this is glaringly unrealistic of the pioneer women from the era in which this was set.  Those frugal gals had fresh, natural complexions, and a good makeup artist can utilize natural hues to achieve this look flawlessly, as seen in Little House on the Prairie and in most pioneer films.  Granted, however, it's possible that I'm the only individual bothered by this.  :)",1418256000,,692,4.773109243697479

5296182,5,B009A9EMYM,"I love all the The Love Comes Softly movies. I enjoyed the movies knowing they continued on with the Davies Family. Showed who Aron became, but it didn't explain his younger sister. I'm guessing they had another child after Aron.
 I have been sadden that they have not kept up with Belinda Owens, who became a doctor and found out she was pregnant. The story stopped after that. We never got to find out that continuing story. I would love to see it continue. I fell in love with the characters. all of them. Would love very much to see the story continue on.
I love this books and movies. I have every Love Comes Softly Movie. I think? If not, I will find it.",1418169600,,660,4.28
5296183,5,B009A9EMYM,It is in two parts. There should be two movies on the one disc. If you purchased the proper version of it. I'm guessing it was a two part series on the TV when it originally aired. If you only see the first one then you only have the first movie and need to re-purchase this one off of Amazon. It might be a double sided disc that is why some of you are only seeing the one movie vs. the other. Try carefully turning it over.,1418169600,,425,3.896551724137931

5296200,4,B009A9EMYM,"I enjoyed ""Love's Christmas Journey,"" a Larry Levinson film, inspired by author Janette Oke.  This was in the tradition of the ""Love Come's Softly, series which I own and call my ""prairie movies,"" as well as in the Christmas tradition.  Do you ever have a bad day, sick day or a time-for-me day?

""Love's Christmas Journey,"" follows a new family relationship formed when Ellie Davis agrees to watch her brother's children while he heads off to purchase farmland.  Her faith and will is tested by suspicious events during her brother's long absence.  This is a family movie with shared joy, humor and the hopes of every Christmas to recommend it.",1413504000,4,645,4.827272727272727

5296214,2,B009A9EMYM,I found it a pretty movie but I read the whole series and some of the names don't coincide in this movie with the ones in the book series which I found confusing and disappointing,1395100800,,179,4.142857142857143
5296215,5,B009A9EMYM,This was an additional pleasing story in the Love Comes Softly series.  You will not be unhappy with it if you like the rest of the series.  Different actors but that has been happening all along in the series.  Can't expect it to not be that way but they are all good players.,1393027200,,277,4.188679245283019

First of all they're celebrating Christmas.....look around there are lush green leaves on all the trees, the birds are singing, the windows are open...where ARE they celebrating, Hawaii?  At one point a couple is robbed at gunpoint and the robber tells them to run off into the woods, the woman says ""we'll freeze.""  The next scene is sunshine and green trees.  I think the rest of the series made sense and were done well.  This one was sloppily done and seems like an  add on just to capitalize on the series.  While it was entertaining, it was just not nearly as well done as the others....",1390521600,3,649,4.495726495726496

5296222,5,B009A9EMYM,This was a very well done additional story for the Love Comes Softly series.  It was great to have a storyline following 2 of the siblings of Missy who was featured in a number of the series' movies.  It's 171 minutes but doesn't seem to drag at all with a few storylines within the main one.  I did find the movie priced much cheaper elsewhere.  It pays to wait and shop around.,1387756800,,379,4.222222222222222
5296223,5,B009A9EMYM,"I just wanted to drop a line and say that I purchased this DVD at my local Sam's Club for a little under $7.00. It's a good movie if you're into Hallmark films like I am. Some people watched this movie because it has good moral/values, but I watched it because I saw the main actress in Seven Year Hitch (a really funny movie; recommend!). The actors in this movie are handsome and it was nice to see all the other familiar faces from other shows/films. I will be buying the rest of the Love Comes Softly films to make it a collection :)",1387324800,,537,4.173076923076923

5296225,3,B009A9EMYM,Cover shown at seller's site did not match what showed up.  Be careful to review details  regarding DVD player compatibility as we had to return a DVD that had very loud background music and we could  not hear much of the dialogue.  Also female main character seemed unconvincing at times.,1386979200,,289,4.72

the rest of the series has been.",1386892800,,162,3.6
5296227,5,B009A9EMYM,"I so enjoyed this movie because it teaches you how a family is supposed to pitch in when the other siblin is in need of help no matter what along with the fact that it shows how the God uses the weak to minister to those that have fallin and need a hand to get back up on their feet on the correct path. It also shows the different ways one grieves over loosin a loved one but how God used has a plan for ev'ryone.

As well as it's the sequel to Love comes softly. You may not think it but the young lady in the movie playin Ellie if you really pay attention and you've rad all the book Ellie is Marty & Clark's daughter.",1386720000,,621,3.8897637795275593

5296230,3,B009A9EMYM,"Nice family Christian story, but it got a bit ridiculous with so many things going bad for almost every cast member. It was also a bit too long and slow to start. I think if it is watched on 2 separate days it would be much better. Still recommend this for family movie nights or chick flick night. Neither my friend or I could see where these characters fit into the series. We've seen all the movies and tried watching in the recommended order putting this movie first in the line up. Maybe we are missing something or watching in the wrong order?",1384560000,,549,4.339805825242719

There were some downfalls as compared to other movies, but I hope I don't ruin it for other readers.  One thing is the ending left me hanging as compared to all the others.  It's like the writers are expecting you to finish the story in your head.  Also, I've been trying to figure out where this one fits in with all the others.  Is it a prequel to the other prequels or where does it go?  Maybe I missed something if someone could tell me, but the characters' names (or the story line) didn't match up to any of the other movies from what I could tell.  It's almost like something was skipped or something is missing.
