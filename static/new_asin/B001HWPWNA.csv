Over all I should have bought the DVD's.",1419724800,,313,4.305084745762712
8309914,5,B001HWPWNA,"If you are very fortunate, you were old enough to watch and enjoy SNL from the very beginning.  Sometimes, as you view these episodes today, you do cringe at the cheesy sets and embarrassing hairstyles (you know how bad you looked then, too) but the talent is so raw and so fabulous that you have to get over yourself and just enjoy the hilarity of this brilliant show.  There is no way to describe to any one born after SNL hit the air of the impact that it had; how you watched it for the first time with your mouth hanging open...Can they do that on live television?  They won't believe you in the day of cable TV so don't bother. You probably can watch this now on NetFlix but in the event of a zombie apocolypse you may want a hard copy so do consider adding it to your collection of humor before it's too late.  You'll have to figure out yourself how to get electricity to your video or DVD player.",1373068800,,904,4.208092485549133
