8147773,4,B000IY05Z8,"This DVD was just what I wanted - an overview of many Euroarts products so I could get a hedge on which disc I want to purchase.  Many are fairly short extractions, but I was glad to see and hear the recordings before purchasing.  I do wish they would have given us the multichannel mixes so we could hear the work in surround.  It appears that Euroarts has a high standard of products.",1186272000,12,386,4.260273972602739
