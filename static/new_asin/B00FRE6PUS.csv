6027591,5,B00FRE6PUS,"No matter what we're going through, it helps to know that there's a God in heaven that cares about us personally.  This movie tells four true stories about life and death, financial concerns and even a story where God doesn't answer a prayer as hoped for.  It's a film that offered new insights into the topic of miracles and faith.  Highly recommended!",1396915200,3,353,4.661290322580645

6027594,5,B00FRE6PUS,"Wow! I love to hear stories about how the Lord works in each of our lives in different ways. I loved the 4 stories depicted in this video. In the 1st story, I was in awe about how the Lord went to very extreme and unusual methods to get the desired end result. In the 2nd story, I was inspired to see the faith of the young lady, and how she put God to the test every day, and He came through. In the 3rd story, it was quite a testimony to see how the lady followed God's prompting, and how it saved her life. In the 4th story, the prayers for Neville Peter were not answered, as God has other beautiful plans in mind. And Neville has the most angelic voice I have ever heard. Thank you for this video! God is always at work, and if we will keep our eyes open we will see blessing and miracles He is working in our lives, and the lives of those around us.",1492732800,,855,3.947976878612717

6027596,5,B00FRE6PUS,"This documentary shares stories of ""regular"" people who faced great challenges; each circumstance was very different. Each one comes to experience a God MUCH bigger than themselves! Have watched other documentaries on miracles and been disappointed. This one doesn't disappoint. This one is what miracles stories should be like! Fast -paced. Well documented. Good experts testify as to ""why."" Surveillance footage from actual events. This is real. Truly touching. Heart-warming. You will be inspired and encouraged as you watch this film. Found the last segment the most moving...because it deals with getting a miracle that is not the miracle prayed for; yet turns out to be a bigger miracle. Not going to spoil the film for you---go watch it!!",1491696000,2,745,5.26890756302521

6027859,5,B00FRE6PUS,"Well done documentary. Combines interviews with the real people and re-enactments of the stories they are telling.
The first story was about a guy who was shot in the head, his miraculous recovery, and how God used it for good in more AMAZING ways (which I won't tell less I ruin the surprise :) ).
The second story tells about a girl who is trying to raise money to go to China, her faith in God, and how God came through for her in exact answers to her prayers.
The third story tells how a woman was told by God to go to the emergency room right away. She did, even though she had no symptoms. As she walked through the doors, she had a brain aneurysm. Her life was spared through the series of events that followed, all because she obeyed God in the first place.
The fourth story tells of a blind man, who is still blind, but whose blindness released a way for him to pursue music.
Very interesting and well done.",1456617600,8,916,4.24

6028032,4,B00FRE6PUS,"Would of Gave 5 stars but the film would mess up about half way through not bad was able to still watch it . I like watching stuff like this unexplained miracles that happen that doctors are left baffled . Do believe that sometimes for reasons that can't explain that somehow miracles do happen whether medical, or driving, kids playing outside etc . Guardian Angeles, God has a hand in it ????  Sometimes a higher force is with us to keep us safe and help heal our bodies that maybe we were not meant to be sick or be that wreck or robberies etc .  I don't know but glade there's a higher force at hand to help us when in need .",1409097600,3,629,4.105691056910569
