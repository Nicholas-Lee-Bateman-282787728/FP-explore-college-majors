7366636,5,B013JBJ6HO,I love when Doctor Who releases the series/seasons in the Part 1 & Part 2 format. It is so much cheaper buying them this way. I don't get all the complainers who want the full complete sets. The Full sets cost 50-70 bucks when they first come out id rather pay under 20 for part 1 and 2,1446508800,10,286,3.9482758620689653

7366711,2,B013JBJ6HO,"After a few seasons of declining writing quality, this series opens with a great scene. A small boy is caught in the midst of a battle. He and a comrade wander into a dirt field where a hand pops up out of the ground and drags the friend down. The boy stands still as more and more hands pop out of the ground. Then the TARDIS shows up and the Doctor gives one of his great speeches about how he's going to save the boy. He asks the boy his name. The panic-stricken child looks up and says, ""Davros."" Yes, the Davros who creates the Daleks--the Doctor's number one enemy. The Doctor is taken aback and the opening credits start. This is the best opening they've had in years.

Sadly, the two-part episode is full of hits and misses. The Doctor winds up on Skaro, the home planet of the Daleks. The old Davros is dying and wants one last tussle with his arch-nemesis before going. Companion Clara and the female incarnation of The Master (known as Missy) are along for the ride, providing some comic relief and dramatic moments. Dealing with death is a major theme in this series and this episode has some interesting ideas in that department. In other departments, the ideas are not good. The depiction of Dalek civilization is not quite convincing and the Doctor's replacement of the sonic screwdriver with sonic sunglasses is really weak (as is his sudden penchant for playing electric guitar). The actors are great, the writing is sub-par.

Episodes three and four (another two-parter) has a ghost story set in an underwater base. The people on the base found a spaceship with some missing bits and strange writing on the interior. An ethereal figure wanders the halls of the base only during their night cycle, leading them to call it a ghost. That one ghost becomes many as cast members die during the episode. The base is in the middle of a town that was flooded when a dam burst. The Doctor goes back to before the town was flooded to find out more about the spaceship, leaving Clara and some of the base staff to hold off the ghosts. The story reflects more about death but has too many bits that are recycled from other stories, even other Doctor Who episodes (how many isolated bases have been stalked by monsters in Doctor Who? They just did the same thing in the 2014 Christmas episode with Nick Frost as Santa Claus--three episodes prior to this story!). Ho-hum.

The final two-part story has the Doctor granting immortality to a young Viking women in the first episode. In the second episode it's 800 years later and she is a very different, very darker person. She's had to deal with the mortality of everyone else around her and can barely remember (or doesn't want to remember) her days with the Vikings. So the dealing with death theme is present again, though they don't say much original. The monsters in the two episodes are generic baddies with zero depth. So the episodes are dramatically average and the new theme, dealing with death, has apparently already played out.

It's a shame that the writing is so lackluster, because Peter Capaldi is fun as the Doctor and would be great if he had better material to work with. Jenna Coleman as Clara does a fine job but her character is becoming more and more just an extension of the Doctor (e.g., she gives big inspiring speeches to characters or she outthinks bad guys) rather than her own person.

I'm going back to getting classic episodes on DVD from the library until I hear that about some new ideas that aren't bad ones (like the sonic sunglasses) in the new shows.",1456272000,,3542,4.580441640378549

7366757,5,B013JBJ6HO,"The ninth series of ""Doctor Who"" has been spectacular so far. Peter Capaldi has yet to give a bad performance as The Doctor, accompanied by his adventurous schoolteacher companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) as they travel through space and time, fighting monsters and saving lives. The spectacular Series 8 proved just how great Capaldi is in the iconic role and his wonderful onscreen chemistry with Coleman, and this latest batch of episodes doesn't disappoint, mostly aired as two-parters and featuring Who villains old and new.

""The Magician's Apprentice"" and ""The Witch's Familiar"" are a great opener to the season, featuring the return of Missy (Michelle Gomez) and Davros (Julian Bleach). They're followed by the tense base-under-siege stories ""Under the Lake"" and ""Before the Flood,"" where our heroes have to save a crew of scientists from ghosts and a new enemy called the Fisher King. This set is rounded out with the introduction of new enemy/ally Ashildr (Maisie Williams) in ""The Girl Who Died,"" where an Odin impersonator threatens to destroy a viking village, and ""The Woman Who Lived,"" where The Doctor must try to stop Ashildr from taking a villainous turn and unleashing a new alien threat.

As for extras, this set isn't in the way of much, but a few ""Doctor Who Extra"" behind-the-scenes featurettes are included, which are a nice little treat as we get a look at the making of these particular episodes. Overall, this set includes a great group of episodes and some nice extras and is well worth purchasing while we wait for Series 9 Part 2. Highly recommended.
""There's this man, he has a time machine...""",1448928000,5,1629,4.985294117647059

7366760,5,B013JBJ6HO,"Are you loving Peter Capaldi as the Doctor yet? The Doctor has examined the problems of near-immortality before, but not like this season. And how about the Master-now-Missy? It's a love-hate relationship that keeps you guessing.  Last but not least, how much hair gel do you think they go through to get his hair to stand up just right?

There are 12 episodes total in Doctor Who Series Nine. In case you hadn't already heard, this is Jenna Coleman's last series as Clara. This review is for the BluRay/DVD release of Series Nine Part One, which has the first 6 episodes on discs.  That's about 270 minutes of a great show and another 24 minutes of Bonus Extras. The latter amount is a little chintzy, I think. But a lot of extras are available free on-line, now. Perhaps they will all be included in the release of Complete Series Nine on discs in later 2016.

The BluRay/DVDs present the show in 16:9 anamorphic and 5.1 surround-sound. English SDH subtitles are available on both the episodes and the Bonus Extras.

I like that the stories in Series 9 are two-parters. Each episode is about 46 minutes, which means that each storyline gets an hour and a half to expand on characterizations and build the tension. I think it helps to watch the two episodes one right after the other, to get that movie feel.
[Edited to add] Part 2 is now listed (as I type this the BluRay and DVD series have separate pages):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Series-9-Part-2-Blu-ray/dp/B017MTC5A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Series 9 Part 2 [Blu-ray</a>]

[Edited to add] A Complete Series 9 is now available on amazon to preorder on DVD or BluRay. Issue date is April 5, 2016.

....Episodes 1 & 2 ""The Magician's Apprentice"" and ""The Witch's Familiar"" Creepy. Creepy. Creepy. It starts with a flashback of young boy trapped in a handmine field. Literally, hands with eyes in the middle of their palms, coming out of the ground to grab you. The Doctor stands just beyond the field, unsure of what planet he's on, and yells to the boy, ""Your chances of survival are about one in a thousand. So here's what you do. You forget about the thousand and concentrate on the one.... One is all you'll ever need.""
Only one problem, he asks the boy for his name and gets this reply: ""Davros. My name is Davros.""
Flick to the future and everybody, including the Shadow Proclamation, is trying to find the Doctor. The snake-man Sarff (a truly wonderfully rendered creature) visits the Sisters of Karn and says, ""Davros is dying.... He must face Davros one last time.""
If the Doctor won't go to Davros voluntarily, Davros will force his hand. By attacking Earth.
But there's so much more going on in this episode. There's bound to be with Missy playing her tricks.

....Episodes 3 & 4 ""Under the Lake"" and ""Before the Flood"" On November 21, 2019. Captain Jonathan Moran, leader at The Drum, an Underwater Mining Facility at County Caithness, Scotland, recorded in his journal:  ""We have located a craft of unknown origin on the lake floor. Visual scans in situ reveal nothing. So we have the craft on board and myself and the crew will now investigate.""
Bad idea.
Three days later, the TARDIS brings the Doctor and Clara to the Drum. Why did the TARDIS come here? To catch a ghost?
""Surely just being around you makes you clever by osmosis.""

....Episodes 5 & 6 ""The Girl Who Died"" and ""The Woman Who Lived"" The Doctor and Clara are captured by, of all things, Vikings. They're taken back to the village in chains and the Doctor's best plan to get out of trouble is to pretend he is Odin. Unfortunately, he's interrupted by a giant head projected in the sky. And said head says HE is Odin. And follows it up with metal soldiers.
That's all supposed to be sorted out until the Doctor visits Earth again 800 years later and finds out the consequences.
""You gad about, while I trudge through the centuries.""

Bonus Features:
Together these 3 extras total 24 minutes. They are different clips than used in the 1-minute Doctor Who Extras that aired on TV for each episode. Each extra covers a 2-part story.
....A. Doctor Who Extra 1: episodes 1 & 2. Commentators include Peter Capaldi (the 12th Doctor), Michelle Gomez (plays Missy), Steven Moffat (lead writer), Michael Pickwoad (production designer extraordinaire), Joey Price (plays young Davros) and Jami Reid-Quarrell (plays Sarff).
Moffat on Missy: ""She's not precisely the Doctor's enemy... the way Delgado played it with Pertwee, the way John Simm played it with David Tennant.... She becomes something much more than the arch-enemy. She becomes the arch-friend and that's really interesting.""
....B. Doctor Who Extra 2: episodes 3 & 4. Commentators include Peter Capaldi, Derek Ritchie (producer), Toby Whithouse (writer), Steven Moffat, Colin McFarlene (plays Moran), Michael Pickwoad, Paul Kaye (plays Prentis, a Tivelian), Neil Fingleton (""Britain's tallest man"" plays the Fisher King) and Corey Taylor (singer and screamer and growler in the band Slipknot).
Yes, Corey's trademark growls are used as the Fisher King's voice!
Ritchie says that Doctor Who ""is a show about science fiction and a show where you try and find the science fiction answer to those great dilemmas."" Such as ghosts. I love how the modern Dr. Who, in particular, gives real reasons (though scifi reasons) for unreal creatures and happenings. Everything from werewolves to Santa Claus to ghosts has been tackled and ""explained"".
....C. Doctor Who Extra 3: episodes 5 & 6. Commentators include Rufus Hound (plays Sam Swift), Maisie Williams (plays Ashildr/Lady Me) and Peter Capaldi.
Hound is so chuffed to be on Doctor Who. He tells us about his first read-through: ""I'm trying to focus [and be] a professional actor, rather than just a boy who wants to run around, take pictures of everything, high five everyone and, you know, spend most of the time just squealing!""

8728007,5,B013JBJ6HO,"Peter Capaldi is my favorite of the new Doctors, hell, he might be the best since Tom Baker! Although there has been some criticism of the show in general since before the last Matt Smith season. But if you're like me, you'll love this Blu Ray. It opens with the Magicians Apprentice, a fantastic story about Davros, with a confrontation worthy of #4's first encounter. I like that the new Doctor plays guitar, #2 played a flute, get over it, the Doctor's musical! This first half of the season is a lot of fun, because as you probably know, it gets much darker in the second half. I also like Clara BTW. She gets way too much crap from the critics. Not much in way of special features. Good budget price. I've got the Blu Ray, but the DVD is a steal at around ten bucks.",1498262400,,771,4.287671232876712
