2246361,5,B0007WFXL2,"I was really looking forward to Season Four because it's when Don Knotts joined the cast as the swingin bachelor Ralph Furley!!! Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the Ropers, but they ran their course. The storylines were also alot funnier with the inclusion of the maneating Lonna! They had the perfect love-triangle, Lonna lusting after Jack,and Mr. Furley lusting after Lonna.
Although I really enjoyed this season I didn't like the way they made the character of Chrissy just too dumb. When Suzanne bleached her hair to an extreme shade of blonde and wore those childish ponytails she looked even more stupid! It was a sad downfall of her once funny character. However I thought Joyce DeWitt looked even better and was alot funnier in season four.
Well, it's a little bittersweet to write this review because John Ritter was the true star of this show and was even funnier this season. I still can't believe he's gone, and I find myself determined to collect every dvd of his body of work to preserve his memory. I look forward to the release of the show Hearts A Fire on dvd that John Ritter did with Markie Post. He also did a very touching Danielle Steel tv movie called Heartbeat, co-starring Polly Draper that will be released on dvd soon.
In the meantime I will savor and enjoy Three's Company season four until season five comes out in October!!!
  JOHN RITTER WHEREVER YOU ARE I HOPE YOU KEEP THEM LAUGHING IN HEAVEN!!!!",1115856000,7,1427,4.658730158730159
2246362,5,B0007WFXL2,"I have only watched 3 episodes from the set. And so far so good. Fans, please write your thoughts concerning the episode ""Ralph's Rival"" and ""The Reverend Steps Out""; I read some negative comments in the customers reviews section and I am now very concerned. Somehow I am not looking forward to watch these two episodes. Please share your thoughts so that other viewers and fans are prepared. Love this show!",1115769600,,408,4.76056338028169
2246363,5,B0007WFXL2,"Three's Company is my favorite show, no doubt, but for me it really kicked into high gear when Mr. Furley moved in as the new landlord.  I thought his brand of physical comedy was better suited to the show than the Ropers' (who were also great, in their own way) one-liners.  The production values also seemed to improve.  This is a great collection and the cast really seemed to gel this season.  The two episodes with Dr. Prescott are among the best in the show's history.  I wonder why he wasn't written into more episodes.  And you can't help but laugh when Jack and Chrissy get handcuffed together.  The extras are really nice; great to see the original cast interviewed after all these years -  but no Suzanne Somers?  Jeez, bury the hatchet already!",1115510400,20,756,4.582089552238806
2246364,3,B0007WFXL2,"this was the Begining of the end for the show in some ways. while Don Knotts was funny&the Ropers had a good run the show started losing some steam,but this season was the last that still kept it interesting. this was Suzanne Summers last Season&the show was never the same without here. Jack&larry were still funny as was Janet. the cast was still funny but some of the episodes were hit&Miss.still it was pretty good.",1114300800,,419,4.6
2246365,5,B0007WFXL2,"Bursting onto the television landscape in Spring 1977, Three's Company quickly skyrocketed in the ratings - cracking the top 8 every season except its last. Sporting a plethora of quirky characters and fresh writing talent that explored modern day issues, the show held its own as one of the funniest programs on TV. Picking up where All In The Family left off, Three's Company delved into the social taboos of its day, dealing with subjects such as homosexuality, racism, sexual harassment, and of course, unmarried men and women living together... But the true success of Three's Company stemmed from the comic talents of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers who became instant stars as a result of their respective roles on the show...

In Three's Company, John Ritter plays the role of Jack Tripper, a young cooking student in San Diego who wants to move into an apartment with his two female friends - the far more mature Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and the blonde and ditsy Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). But the three friends face the possible wrath of landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell), an old-fashioned guy who would never allow such an arrangement. With the aid of Roper's wife Helen (Audra Lindley), the three manage to convince Stanley that Jack is gay (when he is, in fact, a notorious ladies man). Jack's friend Larry (Richard Kline) also fashions himself a player on the local singles scene, and he makes regular appearances on the show. Following Season 3, Stanley and Helen left the show in pursuit of their own spin-off titled The Ropers. Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith Show fame) was brought in to play the new landlord, Mr. Furley - a nave, loud-mouthed ditz who tripled the hilarity of every scene in which he appeared...

The Three's Company (Season 4) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Jack on the Lam"" in which the FBI, in the process of doing a background check on one of Jack's old navy buddies, interviews Jack. Jack mistakes the interview for a government conspiracy to get him. Meanwhile, Mr. Furley has yet to appear even though Don Knotts is credited in the opening scenes... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The New Landlord"" in which Larry, Jack, Janet, and Chrissy meet their new landlord, Mr. Furley, (after selling off his furniture, having believed the Ropers left it behind for the trash man), and ""A Camping We Will Go"" in which Larry tells his actress girlfriend that Jack is a famous commercial producer...

2246366,5,B0007WFXL2,"Season 4 marks the debut of Don Knotts as ""The New Landlord"" Ralph Furley. Knotts replaces Norman Fell and Audra Lindley who spun off ""The Ropers."" Also, Ann Wedgeworth joins the cast as Lana Shields, the sexy divorcee. Although Mr. Furley tries to get Lana several times, she only has eyes for Jack Tripper. Sadly, however, Lana would have the shortest run of any character on the show, lasting for only this season. ""A Black Letter Day"" is the last episode which she appears in, and no storyline or reason is ever given which explains her departure. Also this season, Richard Kline is added to the opening credits as a regular cast member. One of the funniest scenes this season is the hammock scene in the episode ""A Camping We Will Go."" At the end of this season, Jack graduates cooking school, however it almost doesn't happen because of a dishonest student switching his dish with Jack's. This is Suzanne Somers' last full season on the show. A victim of her own greed, she will soon be gone.",1113177600,8,998,4.612359550561798
2246367,5,B0007WFXL2,"Here are the episodes that aired on ABC between September 1979 and May 1980. This season saw Richard Kline become a regular cast member as Larry Dallas,the neighbor and best friend of Jack Tripper(the late John Ritter). Also,Don Knotts joins as Ralph Furley,who is the new landlord living in the Ropers' old apartment. Ann Wedgeworth joins as Lana Shields,a thrice-married middle-aged beauty who takes a romantic interest in Jack. She did not return after the end of this season. Also,there is no explanation of what happened to her after her final appearance. Ralph and his brother Bart bought the building toward the end of the 1978-79 season when the Ropers were about to move to a condominium in posh Cheviot Hills. This season,we see Jack,Janet(Joyce DeWitt) and Chrissy(Suzanne Somers) in the following situations:all of them paying their only visit to the Ropers'(the late Norman Fell and the late Audra Lindley in their only(guest)appearance) new condo,Jack hiding from FBI thinking he was in trouble with them,Jack as a paid escort with Lana(her first appearance),the trio throwing a dinner party for Ralph,Jack at a poker game at Ralph's apartment,Jack building up his self-confidence,the trio about to be evicted because of persistent noise and damages,an elderly homeless man spending a night or two with the trio,all of the cast camping in the wilderness,Chrissy in the hospital for a head bump,Jack teaching a young Italian woman to cook,Jack preparing to take a chef's job on a cruise ship,Janet and Chrissy playing secretary and wife to Ralph to impress a visiting buddy,Janet and Chrissy thinking Jack is having an affair with either or,Chrissy asked to move out of the trio's apartment so her minister father could take a job at a local church,Larry in love with Janet,Jack making a fitness impression for a beautiful girl,Jack ""converted from gay to straight"" by Ralph,being briefly visited by Chrissy's policeman cousin,Janet redecorating her and Chrissy's bedroom,the trio catering to a 12-year-old runaway,being visited by Jack's brother Lee who dates Chrissy,Jack winning money at a racetrack(Chrissy picked the horses),Chrissy with a secret admirer,the trio catering to Ralph's every want and need,and in the season finale,Jack graduating from the L.A. Technical College with a culinary arts degree.",1112659200,2,2323,5.332425068119891
2246368,4,B0007WFXL2,"Season 4, to me, is the final year of the show as we know it.  Losing the Ropers for their own series was enough of a risk on its own (TV just wasn't ready for the spiritual precursor of Al and Peg Bundy, without the Children and then the lousy network execs wouldn't fulfil their PROMISE by re-incorporating them by the time season 6 came around, but that's another story), but on the plus side they seemed to have an inkling for the perfect replacement.  And in perfect casting they chose the inestimable Don Knotts (YES!).  I've always loved the goofiness of Mr. Furley and who better than Don Knotts to play him out?

I am disappointed to hear that this set will be blooperless, but instead continue with more of the rather pointless ""best of"" montages, which seem to be little more than a waste of space.  The remaining extras, mostly interviews, do sound like they'll be good - as they've been good in the past.  I especially am looking forward to the bits ""Casting Suzanne Sommers"" and ""Casting Don Knotts"" (Also a pity they've ran out of pilots to lump in, but that's okay!)

As usual, there's the obligatory episode that has commentary from Chris Mann.  While his book is exceptionally well done, his commentaries aren't quite as exciting and don't tell us much of anything new.  I'd much rather have an actual cast member do this, but the interviews more than make up for this.  Indeed, it's a bit of a surprise to include an interview from Ritter's first wife, Nancy.  That, I suspect, is going to be worth watching.

And I feel sorry for the ill-fated Ann Wedgeworth.  Not well used and then discarded, I liked the potential she had.  Especially when fighting off Furley's advances, which was a good way to replace the sparring between Stanley and Helen Roper.

Episodes to really look out for are:  ""Love the Neighbor"", ""The New Landlord"" (the first one actually filmed yet third aired), ""Snow Job"", ""Old Folks at Home"", ""A Camping We Will Go"", ""Chrissy's Hospitality"", ""The Love Barge"", ""The Reverend Steps Out"", ""The Love Lesson"", ""Handcuffed"" (this one's great), ""The Root of All Evil"", ""Secret Admirer"", ""The Goodbye Guy"", and ""Jack's Graduation"".

DVD quality will likely be as good as season 3's; with the usual plusses and minuses.

I'm also looking forward to season 5.  Which is the show's turning point, but that's another story...",1111276800,7,2354,4.7254901960784315

2246462,5,B0007WFXL2,"When Three's Company came back to the airways for a fourth season on September 11, 1979, many long-running viewers of the sitcom were displeased. Two breakthrough characters, Stanley and Helen Roper (Norman Fell and Audra Lindley), were written out to star in their own series, The Ropers.

There are good things about this season, despite the negative backlash. John Ritter as Jack, Joyce DeWitt as Janet, and Suzanne Sommers as Chrissy seem to ""come to life"" this season. The character of Janet, particularly, was previously viewed as a poof-haired, glasses wearing nerd of sorts, who played second fiddle to the ""beautiful"" Chrissy. But this season, Janet chops off her hair and trades in her baggy clothes for form-fitting blouses and jeans. Personally, I have always favored Janet over Chrissy, both look and talent wise. Don Knotts enters as a well-received replacement for the Ropers as new landlord Ralph Furley, whose brother bought the apartment building. To add spice to the split cast, Ann Wedgeworth comes in as Lana Shields, an attractive older woman, who is pursued by Mr. Furley, but who in turn, expresses she has the ""hots"" for Jack. Richard Kline as Larry Dallas is made a series regular this year, and he too shines.

Unlike the majority, I do think Three's Company went downhill after the Ropers left. If anything, it got better. I was never the Ropers' biggest fan from the beginning, anyways. I mean, I liked them, they were funny, but they seemed to be very clichd and overrated. To simplify it: I never saw how the Ropers were so hilariously funny.

In addition, I think Don Knotts and Ann Wedgeworth, and their characters, were better suited for the sitcom. They were zany, silly, and somewhat unrealistic, but it worked out for the best. Or, let's just say, it worked out for me. I think there was too much time spent trying to make Mr. Furley the new Mr. Roper and too much time spent of making Lana a sex-crazed maniac. That was just the surface for their characters, and while Mr. Furley slowly developed with some sort of a back story, all we ever learned about Lana was she had been divorced three times. Ms. Wedgeworth came in like gangbusters, but after two or three episodes, she's making smaller and smaller appearances. I didn't and don't get it. She was great! Lana was hilarious. He expressions, soft voice, and overall performance was particularly interesting, no matter how long she was on the screen. She was the precise replacement for Mrs. Roper's love-starved older woman role.

MY PERSONAL THOUGHTS
  1) Season Four of Three's Company showed definitely be given a chance. To most, it may not be the best season, but by all means, it is far beyond the worst.
  2) The Ropers did not make Three's Company. This victory goes to the three initial leads: John Ritter, Joyce DeWitt, and Suzanne Sommers.
  3) Ann Wedgeworth was wasted. This Tony Award-winning actress had talent that would go for years, but the big-headed producers with their larger-than-average egos thought she just ""didn't fit in"". Maybe they didn't know what they were talking about. Three's Company lost a great character, Lana, after just nine episodes. Truly a tragedy.
  4) Don Knotts was a perfect addition. To me, he was funnier than Mr. Roper. Yes, he was. Once you see him in two or three episodes as Mr. Furley, you will forget about him being Deputy Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show, a role he played nearly two decades earlier.
  5) The show was at its comedic best this season, in one's opinion. The funniest episodes, one-liners, slapstick, and other over-the-top humor is right here.

MUST-SEE EPISODES
  1) ""A-Camping We Will Go"" (Season 4, Episode 8)
  2) ""Love Thy Neighbor"" (Season 4, Episode 2)
  3) ""The New Landlord"" (Season 4, Episode 3)
  4) ""Snow Job"" (Season 4, Episode 4)
  5) ""Chrissy's Hospitality"" (Season 4, Episode 9)
  6) ""The Love Barge"" (Season 4, Episode 11)
  7) ""Ralph's Rival"" (Season 4, Episode 12)
  8) ""A Black Letter Day"" (Season 4, Episode 13)
  9) ""Hancuffed"" (Season 4, Episode 18)
  10) ""The Love Session"" (Season 4, Episode 17)

Particularly, the earlier episodes of Season Four are the best, especially those featuring all six leads: Jack, Janet, Chrissy, Larry, Mr. Furley, and Lana (ex. ""A-Camping We Will Go""). Season Four shines a bit brighter than the other seven seasons of this classic series. It ranks as my favorite season of Three's Company. Its comedy and uplifted sense of direction seem to make the best of what ""bad"" situations were happening behind-the-scenes.",1392681600,4,4540,4.865885416666667

I've tried and tried again but it wouldn't play the sound. Other than that I was glad with my purchase.. Hope this helps! By the way for those who are familiar with the first 3 seasons I just wanted to make an observation. It seems to me they made Chrissy dumber through the seasons LOL!,1335830400,,584,4.176991150442478
2246488,5,B0007WFXL2,"I've been getting ""Three's company"" series for a year already and probably this is THE BEST one I've gotten since Season 2. Every season has something special to comment about and to be remembered but season 4 definitely goes over the roof! The episodes here are HILLARIOUS! Each and every element for this season was magnified big time!!! And unfortunely (for many fans of this show) the Ropers had to go by season 4 due renovation of ideas because as much as I loved them too at the beginning, they started to become a drag by season 3 with the same old jokes and issues between Stanley and Helen. On the other hand, I must make a special comment and point out how GORGEOUS AND SEXY the stunning Suzanne Somers looks in this season. Man! Ever since the first episode I just can't take my eyes off of her! She looks beautiful, funny and so sexy in every episode she appears. Her character (Chrissy) definitely was developed once again after what they had lost in her in season 3. I must point out that I even mentioned in my last review for season 3 that Chrissy had become dumb and needless. But now, she's back to stay! And I must say that if I had lived back in the days when this season started I would've had a MAJOR crush on her (not that I don't have one for her now, though). It is great also that Larry became a more regular character in the episodes and the inclusions of Mr. Furley (the new landlord) and Lana (the new and sexy neighbor who's more than interested in Jack) was a thumb up... well, as far as Lana goes I believe she only stayed for this season before she was vanished by the 5th one (honestly I've had fun with her, I always thought she was a character to appear only in that episode where she meets Jack at restaurant as a favor he did for Larry). However you see it, this season goes beyond the first three in many aspects for good. Get this show wheter you like this show or not. You'll laught big time and you'll see how a vintage show like this back from the late 70's and mid-80's was so ahead of its time when it came to talk about sex jokes and references of this kind.",1331683200,2,2104,4.249376558603491

2246504,5,B0007WFXL2,"What can you say? This is one of the best of the 8 seasons of Three's Company. Introducing the desperate, but not shy, girl next door Lana; And the ""oh so desirable ladies man"" Ralph Furley are introduced in this season. We fortunately get to keep one of these great talents for the rest of Three's Company's seasons, but unfortunately the spunky Lana only is part of The Three's Company Ensemble for half a season.

Mr. Furley is introduced to us in this season due to The Ropers apartment building being bought by Ralph Furley's brother, Bart. Bart hires Ralph to be as active Land Lord of the building, as for he has more things within his company to keep his undivided attention on. (In Real life The members who played the Ropers left due to their spin-off called ""The Ropers"". The Show did extremely well its first season, then when moved onto its second the time slot of the show was moved, causing ratings to drastically lower; and the show to be cancelled. If the spin-off didn't run for a full season, The Ropers would have come back to Three's Company)

All I can say is that this season contains some of the greatest episodes in Three's Company physical comedy display. How can we forget the episode where the cast goes camping up in Big Bear for the weekend in Larry's boss's cabin; We get the famous scene of Jack struggling with The Tree Sack. Or we can't forget the other great episode of Chrissy's Hospitality; In this episode we have the famous scene when Jack and Chrissy are putting up a shower curtain. But as for Ralph Furley, he had something else going through his mind while this was happening, and maybe even the gullible TV Viewers at Home.

This season would definitely be classified as one of the Top 3 best seasons of Three's Company. Any die-hard comedy fans will absolutely love this show, and especially this season.",1240704000,,1849,4.580060422960725

This is an awesome show and a great chance to see John Ritter at his best, and how he started in the acting business!

2246506,5,B0007WFXL2,"After getting through season 3, which was a lot of laughs, i popped in season 4, episode 1. It about killed me it was so hilarious. I love this show. I noticed some differences about the new season though, in spite of the fact that the new landlord hasn't come in yet. One is Jack's attitude to Chrissy. He seems a just a tiny bit agro to her, making fun of her laugh, and seeming to be annoyed or angry with her. It doesn't put too much a dent in the fun though. I can't remember laughing so hard at a Three's Company. It's the one where he dresses up like a girl to escape the FBI. Janet is a real peace-maker, and Chrissy IS funny regardless of Jack's annoyance with her (she's so funny her ditzyness is almost genius) his annoyance doesn't quite seem reasonable. Hilarious though this episode.

Yes, this season seems a notch more amped up than season 3, the writing sometimes reaching more sophisticated levels than I remember season 3.  In the second episode, we're introduced to Lana who Jack had been set up with by Larry as a paid escort date.  Lana moves in next door.  This one wasn't quite as funny as the first one, but seems to justify Jack's stress level, scenario forced as it may have been.  I miss the Ropers!  Now I notice in the opening credits sequence when Jack is riding the go-cart, he sees a girl pass him by in another go-cart and he's distracted and crashes into a go-cart and smiles - the girl he saw is Lana!  After this episode I now see this scene in a new light.  I hadn't realized that was Lana.

Episode 3 and Chrissy continues to crack me up.  Janet is looking like Pat Benetar.  Furley comes in in this one and i won't give anything away, but I almost cried it was so funny.  A champagne bath?  LOVE those scarves! Oh my goodness.  This one truly had me in stitches.  Mr Furley's tweaked 70s 'cool' and the whole scenario as they try to set him up with Lana.",1224633600,,1894,4.266106442577031
2246507,5,B0007WFXL2,"Three's Company, in my opinion, is one of the all time greatest comedies to ever hit television.  I watched this series as a young child when it was on tv and used to naively laugh, especially with the physical comedy of John Ritter.  As an adult of almost 40, I still laugh outloud.  This is actually a really good comedy for just about the whole family because, although there are various innuendos, most young kids won't understand them.  It's ashame that there aren't more comedies like this on tv now.  I'd recommend this series to anyone.",1216944000,,544,4.625

My one - yet fairly large - peeve with this season is the mysterious departure of Ann Wedgeworth as Lana. One minute, she's running after Jack, trying to seduce him in nearly every episode; the next, she's gone, with no explanation. Considering she was the trio's neighbor, and a large part of the show, you'd think they could've written in some sort of explanation for her absence...anything! But it's basically as though she never existed, which can be somewhat unnerving for viewers who've become accustomed to seeing a character regularly.",1164153600,2,765,5.169354838709677
2246517,5,B0007WFXL2,"Even after all these years, Three's Company is still a show I can laugh at.  Has some classic episodes including the first one where Ralph Furley (played by Don Knotts) is introduced, the episode where the kids take in a kind old man, the camping episode, the episode where Chrissy bumps her head in the tub and ends up in the hospital, the episode where the kids win a lot of money and it begins to ruin their relationship, and the last one is Jack's graduation from cooking school.

There are many other episodes in this season that are worth the watch as well.

There are some really great extras included here as well.  There is an audio commentary for the hospital episode, an interview with John Ritter's first wife, Nancy.  Interviews with Don Knotts, Richard Kline, and Ann Wedgeworth, and informational interviews with some crew members on the casting of Don Knotts and Suzanne Somers.

This is a really great set and I highly recommend it.",1163203200,3,949,4.652694610778443

I am a great fan of Three's Company and would have ordered all the boxed sets; but unfortunately, the Gods of Fortune, Wealth, Luck and the like so prevalent in our culture, for some reason or other, always manages to sashay past me without so much as a 'Hi! This is yours.'

The service from AMAZON is real good. The Boxed Sets were delivered as promised. I am not a big purchaser of anything, so my experience of shopping - whether online or off the retail shops - is limited. But there was a time I ordered a book on IQ (wanted to see how to boost my brain power to better understand the thinking of the DEITIES) from Amazon. This book was supposed to ship through a third party, and, guess what, it never arrived.

I wrote to Amazon and they recredit the whole amount to my credit card.

I am going to get the other boxed sets in due course (one at a time of course), and will definitely purchased them through AMAZON.

2246519,5,B0007WFXL2,"Excellent quality dvd's and no commercials in any of them is one of my favorite attributes to the Three's Company Series. The other is the fact that it's good clean humor and I don't have to worry about the kids watching it. The episodes are hilarious. No matter how many times you watch them, they're still funny.",1156204800,,314,4.526315789473684
2246520,5,B0007WFXL2,"When I was a kid growing up, I remember looking forward to Tuesday nights and ""Three's Company"" was the reason. This show holds a special place in my heart because it made me laugh for years. I am grateful that this classic sitcom has finally been released on DVD for us to enjoy time and time again.

""Three's Company"" evolved and became funnier with each passing year and Season 4 was ""Three's Company"" at its best. After the much loved Roper's moved out in Season 3, Mr. Ralph Furley (Don Knotts) moved in. With his unconventional features, polyester suits, silk scarves and outrageous behavior, he was a comedic force to be reckoned with and coupled with the creative genius of John Ritter's Jack Tripper, they made an unbeatable duo.

Another talented member of the cast who hardly ever gets the praise she deserves is Joyce Dewitt. Admittedly, the character of Janet Wood is not as colorful as the others but Dewitt, when given the opportunity, was an amusing comedienne. In Season 4, her character went through a dramatic physical transformation. In previous seasons, she was a cute brunette who always took a back seat to Suzanne Somer's glittering sexuality. Here Dewitt's raven-haired beauty is finally unmasked. Gone is the hair in layered curls and frumpy outfits. Janet Wood in Season 4 is slick and sexy in her short haircut, form-fitting jeans, high-heeled shows and ruby red lipstick. She's also given some of her best material this season.

The controversial Suzanne Somers is also a feast for the eyes and the funny bone. Chrissy Snow in the first season wasn't a total airhead. She was raw, inexperienced but not really a ""ditz"". Somehow as the show progressed, the character became funnier, more likable, more brainless. I have no complaints because Chrissy Snow is hilarious and she's at her zenith in Season 4. I have seen Suzanne Somers' other shows throughout the years and she was never as comical as she was in ""Three's Company"". This was the only sitcom that was able to showcase her true comedic talents.

Another standout this season is Anne Wedgeworth who plays the overtly-sexual temptress Lana Sheilds. It is a shame her character was cut before the end of the season but Ms. Wedgeworth steals every scene she's in. Her mannerisms, facial expressions and witty one-liners (""Tarzan, can I swing in your tree"") are memorable and highly amusing. John Ritter stated in an interview that the reason ""Lana"" got the axe was because the character didn't ""fit"" in the context of the show. He described Jack Tripper as a sexually charged individual. It didn't make sense that Tripper would be constantly rejecting the physical advances of this older but ""gorgeous woman"".

Speaking of the late, great John Ritter, he was the glue holding all of this together. Jack Tripper remains and will remain iconic thanks to the charm and considerable talents of the man portraying him. You can tell from watching Ritter perform that he enjoyed making people laugh even if it meant hurting himself in the process and for this I thank him. The man was a genius.

Some of my personal favorite episodes featured here are:

 ""Jack On the Lam"" where Jack disguises himself as a woman to hide from the FBI.

""A Camping We Will Go"" which features hilarious performances from Ritter, Wedgeworth and Somers.

""Black Letter Day"" has the girls at each other's throats due to a simple misunderstanding and Jack, as usual, is the unfortunate victim.

""Larry Loves Janet"" showcases Dewitts' considerable charm and comedic talents.

""Mighty Mouth"" features a hilarious performance from Ritter after a hard workout at the gym.

""Handcuffed"" features Jack and Chrissy at their funniest when a harmless prank goes horribly wrong. The ""cake eating"" scene is a classic.

""The Root Of All Evil"" has Chrissy winning big at the race track but winning loads of money fast has it's comical consequences. At least for these 3 room-mates.

These are just a few highlights. Even my least favorite episodes have more than enough laughs to keep you entertained.

With the original characters now fully evolved and with the introduction of Mr. Furley and Lana, ""Three's Company- Season 4"" is a must for fans of great comedy. There's a reason this show and these characters are so beloved. This is classic TV at its absolute, stomach-hurting best.

Watching Threes Company is fun and if you loved it then, you'll still love it now. It never stops being funny no matter how many times you watch it. He was just the most classic ""Funny guy"" and will always be the best in my heart. This Season is full of funny episodes, and it introduces Don Knotts as the new landlord.

2246524,5,B0007WFXL2,"For me, this classic sitcom came into its own during its fourth year.

While many lamented the Ropers' departure, Don Knotts' Ralph Furley was more than adequate enough replacement for the two. In fact, after the Ropers left, it was as if the entire show had a face lift and had new blood pumped into it.

Joyce DeWitt looked her best this year, trading in big hair and frumpy clothes for a short sexy spiky 'do and body hugging designer jeans. Richard Kline finally became a full-fledge regular, and last but not least was Ann Wedgeworth's Lana Shields, who practically steals every scene she was in.

The antics and zaniness was turn up to the nth degree in season four, mainly due to Suzanne Somer's Chrissy, who had de-evolve from someone who was just naive to someone who was so dumb you wonder how on earth did she ever get through the day, much less hold a job. But in any case, her radical transformation of the character generated some of the biggest and most memorable laughs in the series's history.

Sadly, the series' success got into Ms. Somer's head, and this year turn out to be the last full year she was with the show. One can only imagine how much more side splitting guffaws we would have if she had stay on with the show.

In any case, if there is one year which totally define THree's Company, Season Four is IT.",1125878400,28,1334,4.450819672131147
