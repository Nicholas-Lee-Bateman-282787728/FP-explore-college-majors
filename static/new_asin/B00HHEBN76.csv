6163578,3,B00HHEBN76,"This is a great show, but it really should have been a 1-2 hr single show. There is so much time wasted with flashback and hooks(sometimes preview a few episodes ahead), that it could easily be shortened like this. About 5-10 minutes of every episode will be unique to that episode, everything else you will see at least 5 times.

Hopefully, if they do a 3rd season, there will be less use of flashbacks and hooks. I would have given the show 5 stars if they didn't treat me like a 5 year old with no attention span or memory.

I suggest watching this one episode per day, so the flashbacks are more informative and not quite as annoying.",1361577600,3,638,4.352941176470588

They work , they eat and have some good times and all the meanwhile having to look over for abc agents, this show is great I rely enjoyed it and fellows that put them selves on the spot light to make this show this was a very intense season with a a lot of struggles and a lot learned I will continue to keep buying the show on amazon for the fact that I can re watch and relive ever moment of Tim tickle and jim Tom and the other fellows, if u like seeing how moonshine is made and like watching red necks make em,also like very close calls with illegal s*** going on and come close by this is  the show for u!",1360627200,,811,4.006172839506172
