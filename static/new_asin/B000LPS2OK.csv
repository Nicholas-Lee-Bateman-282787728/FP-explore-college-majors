I have a small collection of Korean, Thai, and Japanese videos, I could not for the life of me figure out this movie. It was strange, makes ""Grudge"" look like a Mother Goose project. I didn't understand the ""dance scene"" and pretty the rest of the movie as well.  I would not encourage one to buy this one, unless you can get more out it than I could",1417478400,,433,3.9770114942528734

Sometimes, you see a film title, and you realize that no matter how hard you fight the urge, you're simply going to have to see this movie. It draws you in with an almost Satanic power, casting its wiles over you like a silver fishnet sprinkled with precious gems, blowing cherry-scented cigarette smoke in your face and giving you that come-hither smile that tells you this movie is going to have its way with you and leave you gasping for more. And really, have you ever seen a film title that personifies this idiotic spiel I just regaled you with than Teenage Hooker Became Killing Machine in Dehakaroh? I mean, come on, it's got everything you could possibly want. Teenagers! Hookers! Killing machines! Dehakaroh! (Okay, I didn't know what that was, either; it seems to be a city, or perhaps a district of a larger city.) To lure you in even more, the movie lasts only an hour, so you're not putting in the time required to watch your basic feature film. I mean, come on, this is a win-win situation. See it!

Oh, I should probably tell you more, shouldn't I? Well, as regards the plot, the title gives you just about everything you need to know. There's this teenage hooker (So-yun Lee in her only screen role). She takes a trick in an alley, up against a wall that happens to be the wall of a house of the mother of one of her teachers (Dae-tong Kim, who has also never appeared in another film). The hooker and the teacher have a very, very weird relationship that changes throughout the movie; whether you see this as a planned thing or simple inconsistency is likely to be one of the main factors on whether you like this movie or not. In any case, said teenage hooker ends up dying in a nasty way, and is brought back to life as a cyborg-like creature. (If you were wondering where they got the idea for The Machine Girl...)

Another of the major factors that will influence your enjoyment of this movie is whether you need a really strong plot. This movie does not have one. It is, however, visually arresting; many of the shots here are very nicely set up, and oftentimes the movie seems more like a series of short art films than it does an actual movie. I like that sort of thing, and to me, all the seemingly gratuitous violence at the climax of the movie is just the cherry on the sundae, as far as I'm concerned. I probably shouldn't go around recommending that people watch films while in altered states, but this strikes me as just the kind of thing you want to have going in the background at a party where there is heavy consumption of various licit and illicit substances. ***",1297209600,2,2673,4.484599589322382
8163288,3,B000LPS2OK,It was short and good and simple. A prostiute is killed and then comes back for revenge. She's uses a gun which is a good method when on a low budget. The acting was interesting and you either like or don't like this film really.,1295568000,,229,4.111111111111111
8163289,1,B000LPS2OK,This movie was so bad I could not even get into the first 15 minutes.  That was pretty hard considering it was one of the shortest movies I ever bought.  It was a complete waste of my money.  Please don't even consider throwing your money away.,1290038400,,244,4.260869565217392
8163290,4,B000LPS2OK,"Plot -
This movie is about a girl who is a prostitute. She falls in love with one of her teachers and is going to have his baby. He finds out about this and decides to have the other members of the faculty (who she's also had sex with) kill her. They cut her up and a mad scientist finds her and puts her back together and turns her into a robot. Testing her abilities she seeks revenge upon those who killed her.

My Take -
I really liked the movie. I really wish that it was longer though. An hour was good enough for the movie but seeing her kick some more butt would have been nice. I love the dark, edgy feel to it. Its something I haven't seen in a movie in awhile. I do suggest this movie to people who are more of a scifi based love of Asian Cinema. I mean if you are a Horror Asian Cinema fan than by all means buy this movie but you just won't be scared.

For anyone who has the tomie collection, its more like the third movie.

Overall the movie was good and I would want people to buy it.",1184371200,4,1000,3.916256157635468
