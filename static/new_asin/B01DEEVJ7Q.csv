8755706,3,B01DEEVJ7Q,"As of this moment, mine is the sixth review, the five previous being five stars.  I'm not the one to explain the scant though laudatory attention, though it seems to me unfortunate.  If there is any reason to think deeply about the transgender phenomenon, this film facilitates that.  While what is set before us moves our hearts and minds, as it intends to do (this is part of a series to educate students and business people), it probably deserves some balancing considerations.  Very young children are now being permitted to make the decision that 'they are in the wrong body'.  It seems to me that few would vote for a punitive response to such a stance, perhaps not many more a permissive one.  But a permissive response amount to a kind of therapy which gains credence as it spreads.  If you look back at the history of therapies, many have their day and pass away.  It seems to me the demand for individual rights needs to be balanced against the rights of others and the rights of groups.  While patronizing others falls short of the ideal, certainly it has greater appeal than waging war against them.  Enlightenment dawns on a world that has proclaimed that ignorance is bliss.  I'd like to live in a world where I knew how to be appreciated and appreciate others.  They say to be loved, be lovable.  The group on display here is.",1483747200,,1341,4.584033613445378
8755707,5,B01DEEVJ7Q,"An excellent film - wonderfully researched, shot and thought out.  I now have a much better understanding of the hardships this vulnerable part of the population experiences.  Everybody should see Just Gender.  Thank you for educating me.",1472428800,,238,5.378378378378378
8755708,5,B01DEEVJ7Q,"The book should be read by many, lots of education about gender, and there is so much for people to learn and understand.",1471737600,,121,4.304347826086956
8755709,5,B01DEEVJ7Q,"JUST GENDER has filled a large void in documentaries about the Transgender experience by covering so many aspects of what a transgender person is, what it's like to be  transgender, and the challenges and tribulations that they face by living their authentic selves. The documentary also interviews a large range of people; those in the medical field, parents, lawyers,police and of course many transgender individuals. It's not only an uplifting documentary for people that know all about transgender people or have a family member who is transgender. It will also answer so many questions for professionals, teachers, and those that don't understand the whole transgender experience.",1470960000,,685,5.462264150943396
8755710,5,B01DEEVJ7Q,This film was very valuable to me because I previously had a very limited understanding of transgender identity and experience and it helped me to appreciate the tremendous struggles that face transgender people in this country. Well done.,1470096000,,239,5.315789473684211
8755711,5,B01DEEVJ7Q,"I was curious, as a parent and an educator, about just what a person goes through when they finally can reveal their authentic selves. ""Just Gender"" gives voice to the many who find themeselves born in the wrong body. It's honest, heart breaking, uplifting, true, sometimes all at once. What's best about the movie is that it allows you to see the people behind preconceived ideas and it opens your mind to others. If you're curious, like me, you won't be disappointed.",1469577600,,469,4.7317073170731705
8755712,5,B01DEEVJ7Q,Just Gender is an amazing feature-length documentary that focuses on gender roles and identity. It is an important subject that I simply wasn't informed on. It is a MUST SEE film. 5 stars only because 10 stars wasn't an option.,1468454400,,227,4.7
8755713,5,B01DEEVJ7Q,"Just Gender is a far-reaching and gratifyingly personal documentary on transgender people in todays world. It conveys the innermost feelings of several subjects connected by a single thread, adapting to an intolerant society. It needs to be viewed several times to appreciate the delicate interactions of the people involved.",1468281600,,325,5.653061224489796
