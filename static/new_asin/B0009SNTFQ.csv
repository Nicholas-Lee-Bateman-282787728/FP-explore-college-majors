The emotions and drama in this little show prove to most critics that Mega64 is no joke, it is a drop dead master piece.",1394064000,,250,4.208333333333333
8066214,5,B0009SNTFQ,"I bust a rib every time I watch this show! It's very funny, you have been warned, prepare to laugh. You can buy more Mega64 DVDs here at the official store: [...]",1345939200,,162,4.09375
8066215,5,B0009SNTFQ,"If you're a hardcore gamer and ever wondered about what would happen if someone split atoms of Video Games and Jackass and combined the two halves together, you get Mega64. A scientist, Dr. Poque, creates a videogame machine called the Mega64, which when used simultaneously with a video game, throws you into that characters perspective literally. 3 test subjects are sent letters asking them if they are interested in beta testing the console, and accept the invitation. Ultimately, this turns into something that the 3 subjects, Derek, Rocco, and Sean, wish they were never a part of. Hilarity then ensues with games like Metal Gear Solid, Shenmue, and my favorite, River City Ransome. If you like it enough, you should try doing some of the things in real life out in public, like my friend and I did with teh River City Ransome skit.

I also went to this year's Comic Con in San Diego and got to meet them in person. Derrick got Gastric Bypass surgery, so he's a lot thinner now. I got the Mega64 Version 2 DVD while I was there. I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to see them in person at the Comic Con expo; they're a hilarious bunch of guys.

In addition, you should check out getting the Comic Con exclusive DVD's, I don't know where you can find them on the internet, but I'm sure some checking around wouldn't hurt anyone.",1154304000,,1341,4.630252100840337
8066216,5,B0009SNTFQ,"I highly recomend this dvd to anyone who ever enjoyed classic games. The people who put this out did a very good job.

The seller, however, should be ashamed of him/herself! $50!!!??!?! I would suggest that you get it off of the original site, mega64.com, and pay only $16!",1141257600,4,273,4.571428571428571
