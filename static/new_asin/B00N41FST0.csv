Medjugorje is such a beautiful place and this movie makes me want to go visit.  I did not want this movie to end.  However, I am glad I bought it so I can watch it over and over!",1409184000,,280,3.711864406779661
8676119,5,B00N41FST0,"This is truly an inspirational  movie that you cannot stop watching. Jack Sacco has produced and directed several documentaries and has composed the rich soundtrack scores for such works as ""Beyond the Fields"" It was one of the greatest religious tapes ever made. That's not just my opinion, although I share it. People everywhere bought it and listened to the remarkable story of six children who were seeing the Mother of God every day. The story was told in a most captivating way and the music, also written by Jack Sacco, touched your heart. Jack
