2661376,4,B000ION7AS,"So states the risk management owner of a service that creates 'cover lies' for adulterous affairs. And up to a point that statement makes Ray Elliott (Steve Coogan) seem like an honest if distorted service provider, covering the tracks with high technology so that cheating husbands can have affairs without the danger of their wives' discovery.

Smartly written by Noah Hawley and directed with style by Matt Checkowski and Kurt Mattila, LIES & ALIBIS delivers a new twist to suspense films laced with comedy yet filled with tension, murder, and all manner of underground derring-do. Ray Elliott is a smooth talker who manages to discreetly provide protection for business men who cheat on their wives using photographers to set up situations, falsifying credit cards and names and hotel room reservations, staging gifts for suspicious wives to stave off their concerns, etc.  All proceeds well until Ray's primary client Robert Hatch (James Brolin) hires Ray to cover his son Wendell's (James Marsden) Santa Barbara bed and breakfast, pre-wedding escapade with a S&M girlfriend of one Hannibal (John Leguizamo) - a spree that carries out a bit too far in that the girl is dead by Wendell's inadvertent orders during the 'game'.  Sam takes on the voluptuous Lola (Rebecca Romijn) as his new assistant and discovers she is as brainy as she is beautiful.  He employs her to help his cover of the murder (Ray had switched IDs with Wendell in a planned alibi cover for the fling), breaking his own rules, and Lola ends up saving the day through a manner of crosses and double crosses that fling off the screen so fast that it takes powerful concentration to keep the story progress straight - just the way coordinated crime behaves!

The manner in which this spree takes place involves a large cast including Jon Polito, Deborah Kara Unger, Selma Blair, Sam Elliott and a fine crew of bit players.  Steve Coogan and Rebecca Romijn make the whole caper tick like a time bomb, giving the film elegance and just the right balance of noir and romance.  The rapid-fire cinematography is by Enrique Chediak and the always dependable Alexandre Desplat provides the musical score (with a heavy nod to Offenbach's Barcarolle from 'Tales of Hoffman').  For an evening of fast-paced intrigue, romance, tension, and creative writing and acting, LIES & ALIBIS is a sure bet. Grady Harp, December 06",1165881600,9,2382,4.967336683417085

2661389,2,B000ION7AS,"People run a business creating alibis for men who have affaires. In other words, when a man wants to cheat on his wife, he calls these people up so that they can handle his calls from  his wife telling him he is sitting next to them but cannot talk just now etc. All of this is done for greed of course. They get paid big bucks and driving expensive cars, wear expensive watches/clothes, etc. The problem, and, therefore, the, I guess, the point of the movie is that crime doesn't pay. Yes I know that adultery is no longer a crime in the US but it is wrong and therefore should be criminal like all other immorality. The characters find themselves in a very bad situation when one of the adulterers they are covering for does more than just cheat on his wife.

The problem with this movie is that it is some sick man's fantasy world that this would ever happen and that it would be an ok business model. Only sleazy people would think this up. Only sleazy people would do this. Only sleazy people would seek something out. And that is what you get in the movie--sleaze. But the makers of this movie, while exposing the facade that this movie attempts to create, tries to make us continue buying into the sleaze with a heart motif. They want us to think that the mastermind behind this company cares if the wife is present when the business transaction is made to help her husband cheat on her. They want us to think that the king of sleaze CEO of such a company really wants a monogamous relationship with his beautiful coworker and vice versa as they walk off into the sunset. They want us to think that they are just that robotic--working for cheaters and cheating by day and cuddling before Jeopardy while eating a good home cooked meal by night. Sorry. Even today's mush brained young American liberal wouldn't buy that.

Movies like this get made when no bodies from England want to make it big in Hollywood and washed out, bloated faced has been model/actress wannabes want to stay relevant.

So if you are looking for humanity/good/right to be vindicated in this movie look elsewhere. This movie is about sleaze, Period.",1421280000,,2128,4.51948051948052

2661393,4,B000ION7AS,"Bought this DVD because the writer is Noah Hawley, who did the ""Fargo"" TV series. It has more than a whiff of ""Fargo"" in it -- crossed with ""Deathtrap"" and ""Sleuth"" -- a twisty mystery plot that keeps reversing itself, and characters who keep showing up in odd & unexpected relationships. I'm going to have to watch it a couple more times to follow the plot completely.

Rebecca Romijn is stunningly good-looking although her part is pretty much a walk-on/walk-off. Steve Coogan stars but he's wrestling above his weight in this one. Sam Elliott steals the show as a Mormon hitman. Lots of great secondary characters (a cast of two dozen).

I had to turn on subtitles halfway through because of mumbling, foreign accents and location sound recording. Either I'm losing my hearing or the film is pretty hard to decipher.",1404086400,,819,4.801418439716312
2661394,4,B000ION7AS,I enjoyed this movie.  It was a little over the top but in a hilarious way. Not your run of mill Hollywood story line.,1385164800,,118,3.9166666666666665
2661395,5,B000ION7AS,"This is a pretty small movie, but I find it to be a fun little story.  The premise (alibis for cheating spouses) might offend some, but it moves right along, has a clever ending, and there are some funny, yet subtle, lines throughout (""Vanity will be the death of you, Ray!""....""Let's hope."")  It's not Oscar caliber, but it's a fun Friday evening movie.",1377993600,2,354,4.603174603174603

2661418,5,B000ION7AS,"This a clever and funny story that has all the twist of a more expensive movie. Steve Coogan is a sleeper as a comedian; his style is sophisticated,charming and intelligent. The story line is entertaining and well thought out with a great cast. If all else fails, it worth a watch to see the georgeous Rebecca Romiin prancing her fine self throughout!",1357430400,,351,4.67741935483871
2661419,3,B000ION7AS,"Well, this time the Ross Stores ultra-bargain DVD bin was really depleted. I could only find two movies that looked anywhere near interesting. One was ""Lies and Alibis"" staring Steve Coogen and Rebecca Romijn. I'd never heard of the movie nor either of the actors, but I'm not really up on Hollywood goings on. I got the idea the movie was a comedy and might provide a restful break in between two ultra-action flicks. Well, it offered mild amusement, very mild.

It seems that Coogan and hire-ee Romijn had a business providing the Southern California population subset with too much money and not enough mates a way or two of getting around such pesky problems while maintaining the appearance of the up and up. Lies and alibis were their specialties and the truth was whatever they could make it up to be. Their business involved the adjustment of perception. Under unusual, and expensive,  circumstances a whole new ""Truth"" scenario might be established to placate offended significant others. It was a lucrative business, but sometimes things could go very, very wrong. In one particular case, one of their clients ended up with the corpse of his lady friend and it resulted in the intrusion of some really, really bad guys who were out the right the wrong. Of course, the police became heavily mixed into the whole brouhaha. Was it worth watching? Not really. The filming and sound were okay. The acting was so so. The language seems to dwell on the vulgar euphemism for the lower opening of the digestive system. Would I watch it again? Well, no. I could see giving it 2 1/2 stars, but my rating system won't allow it, so I'll round the rating up to three just because Rebecca Romijn is so pleasant and nice looking.

2661420,4,B000ION7AS,This is a truly funny.  One of the best films I have seen recently.  The ending is completely unpredictable.,1267574400,,108,4.631578947368421
2661421,4,B000ION7AS,"This movie has a lot going for it.  interesting characters, good banter, nice twisty plot, and great comedic moments.  Some of the subject matter is a little dark, but in the end it's fairly uplifting.  Worth owning, worth recommending.",1266883200,,236,5.0
2661422,3,B000ION7AS,"If this is a comedy, someone forgot to put in something funny. Still, it's an interesting premise movie, and the 'plot,' such as it is, nicely builds up to a complicated grand finale that made me wonder just one thing: who exactly got shot at the hotel? The film isn't clear on that point, or was it just me? This could be a direct to dvd movie, though it does have some big names. It moves along fairly well.",1262563200,2,409,4.189873417721519
2661423,2,B000ION7AS,"Lies and Alibis feels like a premise in search of a plot: Steve Coogan's an ex-con man who's spotted a gap in the market and now provides alibis for cheating husbands and wives only to find himself in the frame for murder when one of his clients accidentally kills a woman. With a similar plot engine to Coogan's earlier The Parole Officer - man suspected of a crime he didn't commit has to use his clients to save him - it's the kind of US film Peter Sellers might have made during the early 70s lull in his career and which you'd expect to see on an airplane. But while it highlights Coogan's weaknesses as a conventional leading man and is very short on laughs without have a smart enough payoff to compensate, it's brisk and harmless enough. But James Brolin really should lay off the Peter Falk impersonations in future.",1232236800,,825,4.470198675496689
2661424,3,B000ION7AS,"""Lies & Alibis"" was in the budget bin @ the video store; so I gave it a spin.  It's an interesting comedy that moves briskly as the plot gets increasingly complex.  Ray has established an agency to give cheating spouses an alibi for their affairs.  Steve Coogan plays the agency owner with tightly controlled performance that is subtle and has a splash of humor.  Coogan is currently in ""Hamlet 2"" and played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-at-the-Museum-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000NOKJC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night at the Museum (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

2661425,2,B000ION7AS,"I like Steve Coogan, and Rebecca Romijn is easy on the eyes (even if she's made to look 7 feet tall in this movie), but this flick- as promising as it sounded- was just not up to snuff. It was kind of as if they were trying to mix a Guy Ritchie movie with the Sting, but it just didn't work. And even though Steve Coogan is a hilarious comedian, this wasn't funny in the least. Why cast one of the world's best comedians in a dull, half-hearted gangland adventure? Without any laughs, the convoluted plot and implausible romance failed to hold up this lead balloon. Someone give Mr. Coogan some material he can work with!",1215993600,9,621,4.362068965517241

It may not be the best movie I've ever seen, but it's deffinately better than some of the stuff out there. It's clever, funny, and if not entirely original at least it's entertaining and fast paced. I'll admit I'm still not quite sure what Rebecca Romijn's character is there for other than to dress in white and be sexy.

8147056,5,B000ION7AS,"This is a lot more fun than I expected. Coogan makes a surprisingly likable, dry smart-aleck lead in this not-silly but somewhat tongue-in-cheek, lighter Mamet-like plot of people of questionable morality. His character has elements of film noir Bogart, with less hardness and edge, and a British accent, not entirely like any other I've seen. Romijn is also appealing, obviously, and holds up the strong female character well. Selma Blair adds spice; the supporting men are colorful. You have to pay close attention, especially for the last half hour, if you want to follow the plot completely, but it all makes sense.

Four stars, plus one because . . . it's underrated.",1438473600,,672,5.0
