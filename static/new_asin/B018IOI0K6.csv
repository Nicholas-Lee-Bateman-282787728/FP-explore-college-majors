""Lawman"" holds its own up there on the List along with the others Produced during the time they were on TV. Good story lines and not always showing to kill the bad guy. The stars are just excellent. I have just finished watching season 3 which was very good! Hope season 4 (Final) Season will be ready for release as quick as the other's were!
The price is a little high, But well worth it From a collectors Stand point. I recommend Any western fan that enjoys good westerns to make this one  added to their collection. The Picture Quality in very, very good!",1451779200,6,632,4.3559322033898304

It is a WASHED OUT SEPIA & makes the viewer feel like we are looking at a very dismal display on the screen When you look at this VERY SHARP & CLEAR black & white LAWMAN show you will agree with me that it is better to watch this than the WASHED OUT shows we have today!!
