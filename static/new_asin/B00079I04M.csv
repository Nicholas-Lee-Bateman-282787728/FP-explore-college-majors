8046383,4,B00079I04M,I had hoped this would have been a longer series....but to no avail.  There were some cute parts and some sad parts. This should have had a minimum 6 episodes I thought there was so much more to tell.,1332028800,,200,4.128205128205129

8046385,3,B00079I04M,"Let me say this first: I did not like Interlude, but I do recognize the great storytelling within the series. It was an incredibly trippy & depressing experience, even as it tried to be uplifting at times.

The nameless male character was served as an everyman, to make each & every viewer wonder what they would have done in his shoes. The viewer is asked (indirectly) if they would ignore strange occurences or if they would act upon them, even if acting would cost you everything that you hold dear. The mysteries of the series are the strongest point of the OAV.

When it comes to the romantic sides of the anime the series falters. While the characters are likable enough, the romance between characters tends to get a little predictable & boring. It almost seemed at times like the romances should have been either cut down or taken out of the anime all together. There would have been enough of a reason to believe the characters' actions without the romance bogging down the anime.

My only other complaint is that at times the creators tended to create more mysteries than necessary. I'm no stranger to wierd plotlines (being a huge fan of Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain, & FLCL), but at times it seemed like the creators were trying just too hard to be the next Evangelion. In the end you are pretty much left exhausted from watching the series & keeping up with everything that is going on.

It was nice to see the VA of Sailor Moon acting again in this series & I thought that she was well cast as the voice of Aya. All in all, I recommend watching this series, but I would hesitate on purchasing it until you have watched it once. Again, while I recognize that the OAV was well written & animated, I really wish that I had rented it instead of purchasing it.",1191110400,,1776,4.5062111801242235
8046386,4,B00079I04M,"Simply put, Interlude is strange, even for anime. From characters bearing their soul to you on stage to demon dogs to a drunken guslinger to alternate worlds, the short (three episode) series will raise more questions than it answers, even in the final few minutes.

Ordinarily, that's a bad thing, but for Interlude, it's actually almost a relief that more things are left unfinished than complete. it would definitely ruin the feel otherwise.

The main character is never actually named that I can see, but he experiences a lot of strange things. At first, it's just strange dreams, but it quickly starts deteriorating. To counterbalance that, you have his overly energetic childhood friend Tamaki (who is most often called Tama-chan). She has the funniest lines, is always bright and happy, and wastes her nights dreaming up ""nonsense"".

Tama's exuberance is the perfect counterpoint to the main character's strange experiences. She's the simple and bright spot in a life that is otherwise growing more complex and darker... but then again, is everything what it seems, or are you just witnessing a strange interlude?",1146700800,,1120,5.142857142857143
8046387,5,B00079I04M,"A lot of people tend to say that this anime is confusing and doesn't have a real plot. They say that overall, it doesn't really have anything good going for it. But I LOVED it. I believe that it was the authors' and directors' intent to leave it open for interpretation. I remember seeing it with some friends, and aftewards, we were a bit confused. But it led to a wonderful in depth conversation between all of us about life, death, reality and imagination as well as a bit of tragedy. It was a great experience to hear each others interpretations of the story and to discuss it.

Interlude is a bit confusing and not an anime to be taken lightly. It focuses a lot on the line between the real and un-real. It's for the people who like to think, interpret and discuss. For me, it was a very rewarding experience to watch this and have discussion after. I'd recommend it to anyone who was willing to think deeply about what they're seeing as they watch.",1130889600,5,954,4.389830508474576
