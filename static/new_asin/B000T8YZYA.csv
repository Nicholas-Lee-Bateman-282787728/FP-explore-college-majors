ESCAPE FROM SOBIBOR-- True story of an organized escape from a Nazi concentration camp. With land mines all around and guards manning the walls, over 600 prisoners took the only practicable way out: right through the front gate, en masse.

GO FOR BROKE!--  The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was a group of Japanese-Americans who fought in the war against Germany. Cast includes many actual unit veterans.

IMMORTAL BATTALION--  This story of recruits readying for North African combat was originally a 44 min. training film; it was expanded to feature-length per Winston Churchill's request. The U.S. version is edited.

NORTH STAR--  Great cast in a bit of propaganda aimed at bolstering America's support of the Russian war effort. Ukrainian farmers' lives are negatively affected when their land is overrun by invading German troops.

THEY RAID BY NIGHT--  Commandos parachute into a concentration camp in Norway to free an Allied geneal.

WE DIVE AT DAWN--  The youthful captain of a British sub and his even younger crew must pursue and sink the battleshop Brandenburg.
