This is a great documentary. For my money it's one of the best I've seen in a while. I know there are probably some of you out there who would say that Kraftwerk is not a progressive rock band. Well, if you watch this DVD I think you'll find that truly they came directly out of the prog rock movement - and share a lot of musical territory with Can and Tangerine Dream. Much of this massive documentary (it's three hours long) shows the origins of the scene that gave birth to Kraftwerk. As opposed to many of the videos in this mode this one focuses more acutely on the one group. For that reason I'm putting this one under ""Kraftwerk"" rather than under ""Various Artists."" That said, there is enough about bands like Tangerine Dream to make this of interest to their fans. This really is a great work. It might well be my favorite documentary of the year. Fans of progressive rock should pick it up for a greater understanding of the German side of the experimental movements. Kraftwerk fans and Tangerine Dream fans will want to pick this up for their collections for sure. What a great and intensive work this is!",1226448000,2,1124,4.456310679611651
3499325,1,B001BTOE0Q,"It's a boring and slow movie with tiring discussions. Almost 3 hours speaking including 3 minutes music. In my opinion, if one wants to shoot a film on a revolutionary band of that era, this rate is slight, but enough for failure. But the plastic case of this DVD can be useful later, it is worth to keep!",1222300800,5,305,4.275862068965517
3499326,4,B001BTOE0Q,"This documentary attempts to cover the rise of German electronic and experimental music from the 1960s, centered on Kraftwerk.  There are perhaps two documentaries here: one an overview of the career of Kraftwerk, and the other the development of native German music.  I found the latter more interesting, but I enjoyed it all.

If your interest is just in Kraftwerk, you may not get enough out of this to justify the time.  If you are mostly unfamiliar with German music from the '60s, picking it up, as I did, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream and Neu! in the '70s, then you may find the first hour as interesting as I did.

It's definitely worth the money, and it's on DVD, so you don't have to watch it all at once.",1220745600,18,720,4.507692307692308

3499328,5,B001BTOE0Q,"This is a great collection of Krafwerk CD's.  If you haven't got these cd's then get it.  If you have them already, then I wouldn't bother. Not something to add to my colllection.",1397174400,,179,4.393939393939394
3499329,1,B001BTOE0Q,"There is something inherently prosaic in this dead dull ""music of der future"". Fortunately, man has still some sense of individualism, but barely, and Kraftwerk's fascist goal for music has not rendered vocals obsolete. Listening to this, it harkens back to the techno geek 1970's when Germans laden in neo-fascist uniforms with thin ties and a pound of grease on their hair, showed no emotion on stage, acting like machines. Most of them wore leather pants so tight that they froze while playing, hence the dumb and inarticulate Krautbot look. They copied architecture chic from the 1930's, added some 70's porn montage and called it ""modern"" 1970's and praised the revolution of robots and computers. Not only is that very idea horrifying, but it is also silly. ""Kraftwerk"" means ""cheese plant"" in German and they are very cheesy.

The DVD is probably one of the most horrible things I've listened to. If you can get to the end of it, you'll find all sorts of unwanted electronic noise, Krautbot voice dubs, electro fuzz, beeps, computer konks, repugnant computer-generated vocals, static, repulsive synthesizers, and extremely unpleasant clamor that goes on forever, that you'll soon be reaching for a hammer to crush the CD. In my estimation, all crap. A few American bands at the time tried the stale trend with deadly results, Gary Numan The Pleasure Principle (1979), Styx Kilroy Was Here (1983) , both tossed their careers away because of it.

You'll be reminded of foolish telephone companies, lumbering computer screens, electronic wires, gay 70's discos, and moronic techno cabarets in smelly, dark German cellars. So, unless you're a nerd or have little taste in music, forget this stuff ever existed.

Here's the deal... some of these Kraftwerk movies are so horrible that no sane human being would sit and force themselves to go through the agony of actually watching them. On the other hand, there are 3 hours of them. And there are some novelties here like Kraftwerk early music (which I can assure you really is in bad taste-- but completely unenjoyable). This particular collection is mostly 80's crap that just never hit for very palpable reasons.

It's the Criterion Collection's ugly misshapen sister-- all the Kraftwerk movies that no discerning cinephile would ever watch. Go ahead and get it cheap if you can-- I find myself morbidly composed to watch these things--but make no mistake.",1387152000,,2410,5.047738693467337

3499331,3,B001BTOE0Q,"This is a 3 hour long documentary about the ""German Electronic Revolution"" in which you can see how Kraftwerk was created.

The part about Kraftwerk lasts around 30 minutes.

The documentary is interesting but its title is a bit misleading for Kraftwerk is not the main subject;  they even omit some of their last albums...",1373241600,2,323,4.836363636363636
3499332,4,B001BTOE0Q,"Very comprehensive for the time period that was covered.  I would have liked a little bit more on the impact Kraftwerk's later albums had on the music that.followed, but otherwise it is worth the watch.",1365465600,,202,4.771428571428571
3499333,3,B001BTOE0Q,"While the documentary is rather thorough in it's coverage of Kraftwerk recordings through _Computer World_ it seems oddly truncated given that it was just produced only a few years ago.  No substantive mention is made of the band's status from the mid-eighties on and Karl Bartos' insights here are only available in ""extra"" footage.

While I give serious credit to the producers to focus on such a major trend in music that has not received the critical and journalistic attention it should, their dealing with other electronic pioneers is also very truncated.  While there is deep attention paid the late 60s/early 70s formative periods of several German artists, this commentary stalls out around 1975 in most cases.  The almost flippant disregard for the monumental artistic achievements of Tangerine Dream are perhaps the worst served as they only mentioned later recordings as being less great than their commercial breakthrough _Phaedra_.

All said, for those who enjoy Kraftwerk or wish to better appreciate their influence on many forms of contemporary music, this is an interesting documentary to watch once, but don't expect deep aesthetic commentary on where electronic music has gone in the past 30 years.

3499335,5,B001BTOE0Q,"As with any music doc, fans of the genre will wonder why some artists aren't covered or covered in greater detail. Overall, this documentary is quite extensive and very well done and should please most fans. One thing that sets it apart from so many music documentaries on music is that it includes wonderful interviews with artists from the early movement, instead of focusing too much on the music experts. It's a very long documentary, but we were captivated throughout.",1354838400,,473,4.925
3499336,5,B001BTOE0Q,"I've just watched this movie tonight and I must say that I've been quite impressed. Being DJ and producer, I have been a heavy listener and purchaser of all sorts of music for the last 32 years (my first record was Jean-Michel Jarre Equinoxe purchased at the age of 7). I was always very curious to know more about the influence Kraftwerk had on the electronic music scene. This comes as a very well known fact, but this film gives highly detailed explanations, back to the very begining of modern Germany. I even understood why Bowie moved to Berlin and how he ended up working with Brian Eno. The only parts lacking, probably due to the fact that people in charge of this documentary are a bit too ""old"" to know about, are the influence Kraftwerk's ""Computerwelt"" has had on many contemporary minimal/techno artists. But this seems quite obvious to everyone I guess... What is quite remarkable in this documentary is its length (almost 3 hours), and the level of detailed explanations it goes into to address the various mysteries behind the Men Machine. I wish all music documentaries could be so precise and well documented. Definitely a must see for all electronic and underground music fans.",1320451200,,1197,4.78743961352657

3499338,5,B001BTOE0Q,"Only 5 reviews. Wow, nice to see that Kraftwerk, at least on DVD, are still a minority interest.
If you need my creds, well ""Computer Love"" makes me cry, ""Neon Lights"" makes me look out my window and gaze into the night, ""Trans Europe Express"" roars into my mind every time I walk along a European train platform. ""Radioactivity"" is the most poignant, sad and yet glorious album in existence.
In short, the A to Z of music is contained in Kraftwerk for me.
They set such standards of melody, harmony, elegy and subtle humour that all others sound bogus and contrived.
Next month I'm paying homage by finally visiting Dusseldorf where you might just see me in der Altstadt drunk on love of this group. My homage. My Haj. Join me for a drink if you will.
I loved this DVD. It takes patience and rewards you in return. We go way back. Down into the impenetrable misty caverns of flares, bad hairdos and concept albums. Deeper and deeper. Can, Tangerine dream, Stockhausen, all that once intolerable hippy crap now forms an essential backdrop to the genesis of die meistermensche Kraftwerk.
I'm an old punk whose loathing of hippies dies hard. This DVD taught me that my heroes were a product of their contemporaries but so much more than that.
The commentators on the DVD are extremely inciteful, both on individual tracks and albums. Karl Barthos is extensively interviewed in his wonderfully suave English. It's about as close as you'll get to life at the heart of Kraftwerk.
So many jewels are cast about that it makes you want to gather all your (unwilling) friends for a dinner party where you can let forth on the history of Kraftwerk.
I loved this DVD. I doubt if there's an equal with such passionately committed contributors. Kein Florian und kein Ralf aber es machts nichts.
You have the music. You have the videos. Now learn the story. And come to Dusseldorf. I'll be waiting.",1317168000,2,1884,4.66066066066066
3499339,4,B001BTOE0Q,"First of all, I loved this movie. Then again, I am very much into the Krautrock scene that Kraftwerk sprang from and found that very fascinating. The first hour of this movie is not really concentrated on Kraftwerk, but on how electronic music and Krautrock - anti-popular, avant-garde ""rock"" - came from Germany, and how it developed on different levels (academic, cultural, and 'normal' music channels) I think most Kraftwerk fans will be interested but if you're thinking ""I don't give a damn about Popul Vuh, tell me about Kraftwerk"" you will find it VERY boring. The filmmakers I think did Kraftwerk a great service by this, however, because they show that while Kraftwerk were amazingly innovative and fresh their cultural context was not a vacuum, however it seemed to the West when ""Autobahn"" was a hit. All that said, all the popular Kraftwerk stuff from Autobahn on was dealt with as well as can be expected with no big surprises to uncover. When specific pieces of equipment were discussed, I found that fascinating, but the obligatory talking heads (""Krautrock expert"", ""Music Reviewer"") discussing records got a little bland. All the discussions by the actual musicians in the Krautrock scene (and 1 former Kraftwerk member, a coup I imagine for the film makers) were great.
The post-Kraftwerk explosion and influence I thought would be uninteresting but it was actually very watchable and engaging - starting with the drum machines on Donna Summer's hit, to Bowie's experiments in Berlin, and then to 80's pop music.
I have one tiny thing to complain about, and that's with all the talk about some great and obscure Krautrock artists, why did Faust get shafted? FAUST!?!? Only mentioned once, in passing? Maybe they weren't ""typical"" Krautrockers but as the movie showed, there were only a few threads linking all the Krautrock bands together and they weren't musical as much as they were conceptual......anyway, yeah, good movie!",1259280000,8,1944,5.059190031152648
3499340,4,B001BTOE0Q,"This video, despite its restrictive title, represents a history of ""krautrock""--quite comprehensive in scope. Kraftwerk's influential story is embedded within that framework. Excellent on-camera commentary and historic video snippets. The documentary seems long; invaluable, though, for those serious Kraftwerk fans.",1253664000,,316,6.925
3499341,4,B001BTOE0Q,"This documentary is about more than just Kraftwerk.  It talks about the Zodiac movement, and the early stages of Krautrock.  The hippies and groupies of the late sixties that were exploring music outside of the standard.  Studying electronic music and experimental space music.  And it's fair to say that its humble beginnings were in Hamburg, Germany.

Klaus Schulze, Ash Ra Tempel, Can, Kluster, Tangerine Dream, and the such were explored throughout this documentary.  Kraftwerk was mentioned often here because it is obvious that Kraftwerk was the strongest influence of the directions of many experimental musicians, from Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, Mike Oldfield, all the way up to David Bowie and Depeche Mode and The Orb.  This DVD is definitely worth having if you enjoy learning about some of the pioneers of various technical sound inventions that added shape to all the electronic music that we know today.",1248393600,2,919,5.210884353741497
3499342,5,B001BTOE0Q,"One of my favorite albums growing up was The Man Machine.  So when I learned that Kraftwerk were to be performing on July 2nd (2009)as the opening gig at the Manchester Festival I wanted to learn more.

The DVD is a comprehensive review of the genre. It is 3 hours long and is an excellent documentary of the times, the music, the people.  I found it to be fascinating and (it) filled in many, many wide gaps of my musical knowledge from my youth.

3499344,5,B001BTOE0Q,"I have to admit that I am a HUGE Kraftwerk fan, and when I fell on this, I just knew I had to get it. The goal of this 3 hour documentary is not simply to tell the story of just Kraftwerk, but also of the German music scene in the 60s and 70s, the Berlin vs. Dusseldorf schools of music, etc. The first hour or so brings a lot of attention to the so-called Krautrock acts like Amon Duul, Can, and Neu!, but also electronic avant-garde bands like Harmonia, Cluster, etc. Incredibly Klaus Schulze, one of my favorite electronic music artists, is interviewed extensively as well.

The second half of the documentary is more focused on Kraftwerk's career, from the first three (and later disavowed) albums on to the mainstream success that ""Autobahn"" was, and so on. Karl Bartos, member of Kraftwerk from 1975 to 1990, is also interviewed extensively, and not surprisingly has the most interesting insight and stories of anyone interviewed. Towards the end of the documentary, attention is given to the lasting legacy of Kraftwerk, from the influence on Brian Eno and David Bowie, to the disco scene and Giorgio Moroder (who of course recorded in Germany), to acts like the Human League (thumbs up from Bartos) and Gary Numan (thumbs down from Bartos, dismissing Numan as a 'parody'). And on and on. The 3 hours just flew by to be honest. Be aware, this is NOT a Kraftwerk concert movie (for that, check out the ""Minimum Maximum"" DVD) or even biography. Instead, this should be seen as nothing more (or less) than a history lesson on a particular slice of music history, which I happen to find fascinating.

There are a couple of extras on the DVD: a 10 min. further look into the Berlin vs. Dusseldorf schools of music, another 10 min. of the Karl Bartos interview, which I wish they would just give us in its entirety, and a bio on all of the people who were interviewed for the documentary, which is actually quite helpful.

It is true that maybe only half to two-thirds of this film is devoted to Kraftwerk, and the rest is a history of the post-'60s German rock scene, but if you love this type of music (like yours truly), you owe it to yourself to purchase a copy of this DVD.

This dvd tells the story of this scene, the bands, the fans, & it's a great look at a forgotten genre & forgotten scene that never really got it's recognition from the mainstream...the dvd drags on a little at times, but overall, it's a great reference point to learn about Kraftwerk & the early electronic music revolution that paved the way for the Industrial rock scene that would follow many years later.",1226448000,2,922,4.628048780487805
