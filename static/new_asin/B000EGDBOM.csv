8109089,3,B000EGDBOM,"Ok for a DVD, was filmed years ago with a hand held camcorder. The good: has testarossa,360,550,f40 and f50 footage. Some in car footage. On side streets and highway. The bad: sometimes out of focus and has loud background music.  Overall ok if bought inexpensively.  There aren't many Ferrari DVDs out there. I actually wouldn't mind it if they re released it with only an engine soundtrack, and lengthened the in car footage. However, there are now a lot of YouTube videos, that cover ferraris.",1467158400,,496,4.823529411764706
8109090,1,B000EGDBOM,"You can see better stuff on Youtube and it's better quality. The joke's on me I guess. Like others said, it's a guy with a hand held camcorder bouncing around in a car complete with wind noise. Save your money.",1257465600,,210,4.275
8109091,1,B000EGDBOM,"Wow.  This might be the worst DVD I have ever seen.  It's nothing more than a couple of kids running around with a shoulder mounted camera, ogling Ferraris.  The footage is abominable and consists mostly of the cameraman hanging out of a convertible BMW while a Ferrari drives past him, then slows down and drives past him again.  And again.  And again.  It's edited with amateurish transitions that would make your mom's birthday video look professional, and there are exclamations like: ""Damn!""  and ""That's one bad-a** car!""  The occasional voice overs are truly hilarious, with dramatic (and usually incorrect) comments such as: ""The F40 is the world's first street-legal Formula One car.""  Whaaaaa?!!  I actually felt bad for the one or two legitimate experts they ""interview"" because those guys are left valiantly trying to look professional and serious in what ultimately comes off like a glorified You Tube video shot by high schoolers.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO.  Trust me.",1208908800,,979,5.05
8109092,3,B000EGDBOM,"The DVD is somewhat dated, but still interesting.  There were a bit too many scenes taken on uninteresting public roads, some of which I have been on, rather than high speed runs on curvy,hilly venues which would show off the cars' assets.  The background music tended to be overbearing, especially the opening hip-hop music which seemed to be out-of-sync with what Ferrari represents. The photography was outstanding, as were the interviews with the owners and restorers, but I really missed the sounds of the wonderful engines being taken up and down the rpm scale.  I probably won't view this one again for a while.",1200268800,,618,4.923076923076923
8109093,1,B000EGDBOM,"I just watched this atrocity of boredom. My only explanations after wasting 2 hours were:

1- Somehow the ""real"" DVD got mixed up with the 4th graders school project video.

2- These guys work for Lamborghini and want to degrade and insult Ferrari with this video.

3- This was made by the students of a school for the mentally retarded. In which case, ""GOOD JOB!!""

4 and most likely - A bunch of ignorant and life-less, money-less, girlfriend-less and plain DUMB twentysomething-years-old thought it would be a good idea to shoot ferraris on the street driven like granma. MAking stupid brakings and accelerations to pass a Saab traveling at 15 mph with a shaky camera. It is unbelievable how could someone even invest 5 minutes of their lives creating this monstruosity. I bet those Ferrari owners got pretty upset when they saw this thing.

My advise to Mr. French: Please make movies about something else. How could you insult such great automobiles with this joke of DVD. You don't know anything about cars. Also I loved the comment of the afro-american guy ""look at the stereo daaawg!!"". Like if that is why one gets an F360.

Maybe you could make a coool documentary about YUGO (I heard they're hot right now). But please stay away of any other brands.",1179187200,,1260,4.730593607305936
8109094,1,B000EGDBOM,"I have blown $30 on many things, but this is one of the few things that I truly believe I would have gotten more satisfaction by burning the money with a match.  To make this video a bunch of kids took their mom's camcorder and went out to oogle some ferraris on the roads of LA.",1153526400,5,279,3.982142857142857
8109095,1,B000EGDBOM,"A couple of highlights but mostly lows. It could have been saved

somewhat if they would have had the good sense to RECORD the sound of the engines, but you are treated to their choice music as they follow and have varius Ferraris approach the camera vehicle. They waste the Willow Springs segment without 'in car' at this venue. My wife had just 2 questions after watching this

DVD. 1 Why did you buy this? 2 Can you get your money back?",1147737600,5,439,4.341463414634147
8109096,1,B000EGDBOM,This is nothing more than a guy with a camcorder and some free time.  Do not waste your money on this one.  There are many other DVDs with better footage and knowledgeable commentary. I agree with everything the previous reviewer said except I seriously doubt Ferrari actually licensed this product.  Keep on shopping...,1145145600,,320,5.0
8109097,2,B000EGDBOM,"The potential for this DVD is never met. It's basically a hand-held camcorder-shot documentary. The disc comes off as more of a home movie than a true thrill ride. Although the cars are beautiful, and enthusiasts will enjoy the selections, the shooting is amateurish and poorly lit. For the most part the creators are just following alongside of the cars as they pass by over and over again. The chapter on the restorations is the only saving grace of the film. It is genuinely interesting. I am frankly surprised that Ferrari licensed this product. It's not the worst 60 minutes I've ever spent but I wanted so much more.",1143763200,4,622,4.715596330275229
