8745180,3,B019HKBTA8,"In this performance Rossini's Mos was cut from about 3 hours to 80 minutes. It was performed in a semi-staged version in the Duomo di Milan cathedral. There wasn't much acting. Costumes were used, but no physical scenery. Supportive designs and scenery were projected onto the cathedral's towering pillars and walls.

The singing was generally excellent but the orchestra occasionally overwhelmed the singers. Two of the lead singers had constant, large vibratos that didn't always blend well with the other singers during ensemble numbers. The chorus and orchestra sounded fine. The video quality was excellent.

This was probably a grand spectacle for the live audience. If you are looking for a visual display this may please you very much. If you are looking for a performance of Mos you may be disappointed.",1482796800,2,812,5.143939393939394
8745181,4,B019HKBTA8,"The magnificent Duomo di Milan, the Milan Cathedral, was originally a gothic cathedral built atop an early Christian basilica which was itself built atop a Roman temple, and it's been tinkered with ever since. It's the site of a marvellous new production of Rossini's ""sacred melodrama"", Mos, which has been packaged into an equally marvellous Blu-ray disc.

There's plenty of impressive music in this piece; its surprising how it can sparkle like the Barber of Seville and yet provide a full measure of drama and piety. In this production so much of the credit goes to conductor Francesco Quattrocchi, who has the enormous challenge of providing a cogent orchestral sound in such a huge volume as the interior of this massive church. It's the largest church in Italy, the fifth largest in the world. The singers are led by the great Ruggero Raimondi, but this is more an ensemble piece than a star vehicle. There are no weak links amongst the principal singers, though the acting in this semi-staged version set within a huge space is necessarily broad, to reach the audience as well as the HD cameras. The chorus is equally important, and comes through with flying colours. In the end we rely on Quattrocchi to marshall all of these resources - the fine solo singers and the excellent Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo di Malano Orchestra and Chorus - while keeping them all in balance, acoustically, dramatically, and musically.

We come now to the thing that makes this really special: the production treats the Duomo interior, which somehow seems super-opulent while also being super-austere, as a giant stage set, and the new technology of video mapping, or projection mapping, turns the Duomo into a dynamic space that opens up the story. The timeless stones come alive and help to tell the story. This is the second time in the last couple of weeks I've ended up talking about new technologies when reviewing a new classical music disc; I love it!

There's a few YouTube clips of this production that give you only a hint of an idea of how impressive this is on a large HD screen with good 5.1 surround sound. For the full effect you'll have to buy the disc and see for yourself!",1460678400,4,2182,4.7824933687002655
