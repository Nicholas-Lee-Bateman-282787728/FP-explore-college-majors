8099755,5,B000CNGC8O,"I will be buying all of their DVD over time.  Very simple to understand and follow.
Don and Kasia give tips on how to move smoothly around the dance floor.",1362873600,,155,4.166666666666667
8099756,5,B000CNGC8O,"In learning with this DVD, you can't fing a better teachers at home like Kasia and Donald. They explain the steps very well and are good pedagogues. Thanks",1357776000,,155,4.571428571428571
8099757,5,B000CNGC8O,"This couple has created some outstanding digital dance resources for the ballroiom/social dance community!

I own 5 of their dance dvds and highly recommend any of their ballroom productions.  They take the time to demonstrate each figure...show the woman's part from different angles, then the man's, then together...all the while they are giving additional hints for technique and styling that I haven't seen in any other dance video...their technique is also very clear, solid and well illustrated!

This is a great practice video for the new student, beginner, or intermediate!
My only complaint is that the couple should have also created the absolute intermediate and absolute advanced ballroom videos for the already dancing community!  Maybe, we can enjoy these titles in the near future!

Happy dancing!",1209945600,2,812,5.412698412698413
8099758,4,B000CNGC8O,"It doesn't matter if you are at the beginning or intermiediate level, this dvd will get you out of the chair and onto the dance floor in practically no time. As I've said before, Donald and Kasia break each of the steps down so you want to learn more. The patterns are presented with clarity as is the hold, footwork and timing for each phase of the dance.

The foxtrot has been one of my favorite dances since the beginning and I've yet to meet anyone who hasn't enjoyed it. I only wish there was more foxtrot music on the cd. That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.

 Why waste the money on dance classes. This video is easily worth five to eight weeks in a dance studio.  When you compare the price of this dvd to dancing lessons, never have the savings been so sweet.

ENJOY",1177286400,4,791,4.211920529801325
8099759,5,B000CNGC8O,My wife and I enjoy and have learned much from this DVD.  I bought the DVD plus CD version from Dancevision.,1176768000,,108,4.142857142857143
8099760,4,B000CNGC8O,"Donald and Kasia present each of the dances clearly and in detail. Multiple camera angles are used and after each has been demonstrated, both mens and ladies positions, with proper timing instruction, they dance it with music. In my humble opinion, these lessons are easily worth five or six weeks in a dance studio. Save your money, buy this DVD. You'll be on the dance floor fast.",1176163200,,382,4.7164179104477615
8099761,5,B000CNGC8O,These people are vastly better instructors than anyone else out there.  They do each step for the man and the woman and each is explicitly clear.  I wish they had an advanced foxtrot DVD.  Excellent.,1172188800,2,199,4.628571428571429
8099762,4,B000CNGC8O,I learned a great deal from this disc and only wish it held more.  The same step is shown from a wide variety of angles.  After the basics of each step are presented--thoroughly--only then does the instructor provide advanced styling tips.  Well worth multiple viewings.,1171670400,2,270,4.955555555555556
8099763,5,B000CNGC8O,"This is excellent instruction for beginning dancers to feel more comfortable on the dance floor. Demonstrations and instructions are very good. This is going to help hubby and I feel more confident in dancing.
Great production too.",1122422400,3,231,5.27027027027027
