3104460,2,B0013D8L8G,"""Walk All Over Me"" is a kind of film that you find it hard to categorize. The best description I can come up with for this quirky indie film is noir comedy, but whether or not you find it funny totally depends on your taste. With all respect to those who made this film, including the star Leelee Sobieski (and I really like her), not much really amused me.

Leelee Sobieski is Alberta, a young woman living in a small town, who has a penchant for getting into trouble, or, to be precise, causing trouble to people around her. After ""losing"" her boyfriend's money, Alberta travels to Seattle where her former babysitter Celene (Tricia Helfer) lives in a big posh house. Alberta stays at Celene's house, but she just cannot stay away from trouble, this time involving Celene's unsuspecting ""customer"" and some thugs following him.

In spite of the film's nice DVD cover and tagline that goes ""Love. Larceny. Latex,"" the end result is tame at best. It seems director Robert Cuffley is not really interested in the dominatrix part of the story, which is completely forgotten in the latter half of the film. What is more disappointing is the heroine of Leelee Sobieski, who is miscast. Her trouble-prone character is depicted clumsily and her character seems contrived.

But the most frustrating thing about ""Walk All Over Me"" is that it has no style of its own, narratively or visually. The film consistently sets up situations where ridiculous things take place, while it never lets us know about the characters who seem to constantly change their traits according to the situations. In one scene Celene is strong, capable of literally beating up a gangster. However, this intriguing part is followed by clich&eacute;d story in which her unique personality is mostly forgotten. The film lacks not only character development:; it doesn't have characters either.

What remains is twists and turns of the storyline, which simply don't care. ""Walk All Over Me"" is a well-acted, mildly entertaining crime comedy.",1272067200,,2005,4.940652818991098

When Alberta (Leelee Sobieski, looking like the lovechild of Helen Hunt and Chlo Sevigny) runs away from her dead-end life she arrives on the doorstep of Celene (Tricia Helfer), a Vancouver dominatrix. It doesn't take long until Alberta -- who's known for ""jumping from one mess to another"" -- dons some shiny leather boots and pretends to be Celene for a new client, Paul (Jacob Tierney). She inexplicably falls head over heels for him in a matter of minutes, shortly before learning that he's involved with some dangerous dudes from Ontario. This begins a convoluted plot involving stolen money, ruined expectations and bondage.

Despite the upscale lifestyle that Celene enjoys -- in her nurse, cop, or army outfits -- it's all artifice.

Celene has zero empathy for her clients and sees them as living cash machines. She could've been a spokesmodel or acted in community theater if the pay were better. Instead, she's using her vocation as a domme as a shortcut to her ""life plan"" of becoming an actress. The rare domme, Celene uses her real name and doesn't put up many barriers between herself and her clients. Perhaps because she's so superficial she has nothing to hide. There's little discussion of professionalism or the lack of sexual contact/intercourse involved with being a professional dominatrix. Even Alberta assumes that the trappings of domination -- floggers, feathers, leather masks, et cetera -- are merely accouterments of a prostitute.

3104464,3,B0013D8L8G,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. Some girl somewhere is in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend. He owes some people some money and this prompts her to run away after losing. She gets on a bus and the driver does not charge her any money to board and she goes to her sister's house.

2. At the sister's house, we find out that the main character (Alberta) has a habit of messing up things.

3. She finds out that the sister is a dominatrix and tries to assume her identity in order to make some extra money.

4. As a result of assuming her sister's identity, Alberta gets into all sorts of trouble with some men who are looking for $500,000 that is missing.

5. Along the way, we get to see some really weird looking dominatrix tools of the trade.

6. Goofy Alberta and her sister play them men off one against the other and finally one of them ends up in jail and the other broken down.

Review:

This was one of the silliest movies that I've recently seen (and I've seen a lot). Can we really be expected to believe that: A) A man who was looking for $500,000 would have such reservations about killing someone that he thought stole from him? B) That any person who had that much money would hire two assistants that were that stupid/ fraught with issues? C) That a man would pull a gun inside of a store (in Canada) if he was going to kill someone?

I just don't think that people anywhere who can make that much money are that stupid.

Is there anyone that is willing to pay THAT much money to be dominated? (C$300 per hour)?

There were also some loose ends in this movie.

Final verdict: Save your money unless this is on the $2 rental shelf.",1235001600,,1653,4.279742765273312

The plot was almost believable but poorly written & directed. There really wasn't any BDSM in the movie.

I give this 2 stars only because LeeLee looks hot in the uniforms. Besides that, it doesn't have much going for it. Tricia Helfer looks much hotter in Battlestar Galactica.",1214870400,,587,4.580952380952381
