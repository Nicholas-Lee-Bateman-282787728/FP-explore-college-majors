7979382,5,B000087F27,"I wasn't a Don Wilson fan growing up i actually knows me of hated the guy he was this skinny guy doing Kickboxing and he just didn't have the muscles or build that fit what my perception of an action movie star or a fighting Champion should be or built like back when I was a teenager in the 1989's.
I was a Van Damme fan and when I saw Bloodfist back in the late 1980's I thought it was a cheap knock off of Van Dammes Bloodsport back then. What I meant was it didn't have that Hollywood movie magic style of movie making as other Hollywood movies did back then. Looking back at it now though.... I think it was ahead of its time in terms of the way they shot and filmed the movie. It has a sense of a reality tv type of style of shooting tv shows and movies.

When I watch it now it looks more realistic, the type of film and the choreography of the fight scenes. It still has some flashy Hollywood type fight scenes but there is a subtleness about some of the choreography that is realistic also and in a sense it was ahead of its time.

 So now I actually like the movie as where before I didn't because I didn't think of Don Wilson as that Action star because he's some skinny dude with hardly and muscles or ""cut/sculpted"" type of muscles that I thought. Fighting Champion would have back then as a kid doing Kickboxing .
It's not a bad movie for Karate action . I hated Don Wilson back then but now.....he's alright.

I watched it again and I forgot about the movie scenes but he gets the blonde stripper  in the movie  and I'm laughing because she looks like my ex.

Lol Don ""the Dragon"" Wilson hanging out with strippers....he's alright lol",1482537600,,1649,4.182965299684542
