4861067,4,B005RH16YA,"When I was growing up in the 1950s and the early 1960s, I remember reading about this film in TV GUIDE (remember when it was a staple in every home?) and looked forward to seeing it. Unfortunately in those pre-cable/streaming days, it was never shown on a channel that could be picked up on the family TV. By the end of the 1960s it had disappeared from TV showings and became one of those lost Fox Film movies that were made before the merger with Darryl F. Zanuck's 20th Century Pictures in 1935 (in fact it was the last pre-merger production). A massive warehouse fire in 1937 desroyed virtually all of the original negatives of the Fox Films made up to that time. Only those of Shirley Temple & Will Rogers, the company's two biggest stars, were still readily available. Spencer Tracy appeared in over 20 movies at Fox beginning in 1932. Some of these were very highly regarded (ME & MY GAL & THE POWER & THE GLORY to name two) but few were box office successes. His later fame from his movies at MGM coupled with the warehouse fire have kept most of his early work from being seen. Hopefully that will be remedied with the Fox Cinema Archives series starting with this DVD-R release of DANTE'S INFERNO.

This film was Tracy's last for Fox and it was a grand production directed by Harry Lachman who was a celebrated post-Impressionist painter. His eye for detail can be seen throughout the film but nowhere more than in the silent 10 minute ""Hell"" sequence which was patterned after Gustave Dore's illustartions for THE DIVINE COMEDY. The story of an unscrupulous carnival barker who eventually gets his comeuppance and a chance at redemption (shades of LILIOM / CAROUSEL) was tailor made for Tracy who reportedly hated the movie yet it never shows (it never did). Claire Trevor does a good job in the unchallenging role of his wife and it gives us the rare opportunity to hear the wonderful voice of stage actor Henry B. Walthall who began his career in the silent era and is best known for BIRTH OF A NATION. The young dancer in the casino boat sequence at the end is a 16 year old Rita Hayworth billed under her real name of Rita Cansino. Filled with personal drama, spectacular sets and effects as well as a riveting climax, DANTE'S INFERNO is not a great film  but it's an excellent example of early Spencer Tracy and the work of the artisans at pre-20th Century Fox.",1402272000,7,2377,4.5514018691588785
4861068,2,B005RH16YA,I don't even know why they would make it. Next to those Presley movies this one takes all honors for The Worst Movie ever made.  JC,1401494400,,131,4.038461538461538
4861069,4,B005RH16YA,"Religious exploitation, sex exploitation, visions of hell and torment, falling buildings, sinking ships, and motion picture code violations that are allowed to pass by the Breen office only because the film half-heartedly preaches against the ""pitfalls of evil"".

Jim Carter (Tracy) is a wandering nomad who lands a job at a carnival wearing blackface and getting hit in the face with baseballs. He ends up being fired for insubordination. Pennyless and hungry, he's befriended by Pop McWade (Henry Walthall), the owner of ""Dante's Inferno"", a peep show/museum featuring evildoers throughout history, including Alexander the Great, Cleopatra, and Salome. Jim eventually meets and falls in love with McWade's daughter, Betty (Trevor). Dante's Inferno doesn't bring in a lot of money, but Jim solves that by becoming a barker and luring the crowds to the show. Jim eventually becomes consumed with greed as ""Dante's Inferno"" brings him money and riches that he never possessed before.

Also includes a cameo by Rita Hayworth (Rita Cansino) as a dancer.

The print used to remaster this DVD isn't great, but it sure beats the 80's VHS master used to broadcast the film on Fox Movie Channel in recent years. Overall, the video quality is acceptable and the audio is understandable.

This review is for the Fox MOD DVD.",1396915200,7,1314,5.154929577464789
4861070,2,B005RH16YA,"The 2 star rating is for the DVD version sold by 'jedbaltc'  The picture quality is very poor, no sharpness or contrast.  It is a black and white movie and the picture is so soft that the colors just blend into grey.  movie is a terrible blurry copy and almost unwatchable.

 Another problem is, seller won't pay to return it and after you pay to return it you will never hear from the seller again.  I've been waiting two and a half weeks since I last e-mailed the seller about the refund.",1383350400,3,490,4.271739130434782

4861072,5,B005RH16YA,"This is a dramatic and visual thrill-ride that plunges into the depths of human consciousness with elaborate visions of suffering, punishment and damnation that follow the course of the design and construction of a Coney Island carnival ride and the excesses of its over- ambitious entrepreneur.  It is as unique as it is interesting in its eye for Dante-esque detail and atmosphere.",1348617600,10,383,5.17741935483871
4861073,5,B005RH16YA,"FOX's 1935 version of DANTE'S INFERNO is not at all a remake of that studio's 1924 silent picture, although it does incorporate some of the most surrealistic footage from the original photoplay, that is, a depiction of Hades and its suffering masses.

Here, the character played by Tracy, who was making his final movie for FOX, is shown from Scene 1 to be a conniver and a user.

Down on his luck after losing an engineer job, Jim Carter is reduced to stoking a ship's furnaces to get back to the US from Australia. In an allusion to the Great Depression's hard times, Jim takes a job as a corked-up carnival ball dodger. A fast pitch to the eye is enough for Jim to call it quits. A kindly older man named Pop McWade  (Walthall) offers him work at a struggling Dante's Inferno concession, and the glib Jim barks up a crowd for his new boss. He also falls for Pop's niece, Betty (Trevor), and in typical cinematic brevity, they marry. Next there's a baby and Jim is ready to parlay the success of his and Pop's Inferno into a giant-sized operation that would do Disney World proud.

A concessionaire who owns a chute ride on a piece of land that Jim wants refuses to relocate and he's forced out of business when Jim pays the back rent the man owes. This destroys the poor fellow, and we later see what becomes of him.

The new and improved Inferno, a monster of the midway built on the site of the former chute ride, is awesome. FOX clearly lavished lots on this portion of the film. A NY Times article of the day mentions nearly 5000 artisans and 3000 extras were employed to bring this work to the screen, very impressive for any age, but for '35 a remarkable achievement.

Jim's next scheme is a super luxury liner that's really a cruising casino for the moneyed. Although he's a great dad to little ""Sonny"" (Beckett), the marriage to Betty falls apart after Jim bribes an inspector to keep quiet about hazardous conditions at the Inferno. A partial collapse of the structure puts Pop in the hospital and it's here he talks to Jim about choosing to do right. The advice is predictably ignored, which sets up the film's spectacular climax.

It's a genuine classic. Highest recommendation!

4861074,4,B005RH16YA,"Without a doubt, Spencer Tracy is one of my favorite actors.  In this fascinating movie of ""carny life"", he plays a ""get rich quick"" opportunist who builds a fascinating carnival type attraction which brings to life the different levels of Hell depicted by Dante in his masterpiece ""Inferno.""  When a fire inspector discovers that the attraction is unsafe...Spencer Tracy pays him off, with horrific consequences when the structure collapses.  It is a story of a man who has fallen who is eventually redeemed.  Great visuals...I can't understand why the movie is out of print or unavailable in DVD yet.",1327622400,10,602,5.05050505050505
4861075,1,B005RH16YA,"It is so upsetting when you see people speculating on Dante's Inferno story.  This is one more of those movies!  Just looking at the poster you can tell that it is cheaply made.  It uses images of Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise, but they call it Dante's Inferno. Geez!  Any ideas out there?  Take your money somewhere else, it is not even worth your time.",1282608000,2,356,4.5

8484262,5,B005RH16YA,"Spencer Tracy was brought back from San Diego (he was on a drunken binge) so that they could start shooting the picture. He resented it and always claimed this was the worst picture he had been in. Not so! His acting is fine, and he is surrounded by an excellent cast (including ""Crash"" Corrigan as Lucifer! Not to mention Rita Hayworth and Claire Trevor). Director Harry Lachman (who had established a substantial reputation as a post-impressionist painter) provides memorable visuals based on the title. Leslie Halliwell (British film critic) described it as ""one of the most unexpected, imaginative and striking pieces of cinema in Hollywood's history.""",1493769600,,656,5.19811320754717
