5737999,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"I never watched ""The A-Team"" when it first came out in the 80s, but I saw it on the Sleuth Channel a few years ago and I was instantly hooked! Whether you're a real guy or a man's woman like me, if you like adventure and action, combined with good, old-fashioned values, you will LOVE this show! The team is made up of a group of fugitives wrongly accused of a crime and on the run in the ""Los Angeles Underground"" who help people being controlled or bullied by others. You will bask in the glory of the idea that the good guys can always beat the bad guys. There are great fist-fights and car crashes, but no bloody violence. The team is led by Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith who always has a plan, and is played by the ever-elegant but masculine and charming George Peppard. The rest of the team includes the always entertaining Mr. T as B.A. Baracus, team tough guy and mechanic, as well as the ever-comedic and unusual Dwight Schultz as H.M. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock, and lastly, the sexy but vulnerable and charming Dirk Benedict as the schemer and scammer of useful property, Templeton Peck, AKA ""Face"" or ""The Face Man."" The 5th Season is not very well done, but you may as well have the whole collection with the cool van package. And if you think no one knows this series today, the theme from the show is my ring tone and EVERYONE young and old knows it AND the show!!!",1278547200,3,1372,4.36328125
5738000,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"THIS IS MY BEST PURCHASE YET!  I LOVE THE  A-TEAM AND BEING ABLE TO WATCH IT WITHOUT COMMERCIALS IS FANTASTIC, AND IT INCLUDES A NIGHTRIDER EPISODE.  A MUST FOR ANY A-TEAM LOVER!",1278288000,,178,4.5
5738001,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"I was introduced to The A-Team on Christmas, and ever since then, I've been hooked. I watched all five seasons to get ready for the upcoming movie. Hannibal, B.A., Face, and Murdock are ex Special Forces and were sent to prison for a crime they didn't commit. 10 years after they break out, they are hired by people who seek their help. Hannibal is the leader of the group. Face is the charm and cons people to get what he wants. B.A. is the muscle, and Murdock is the crazy out-of-control pilot who helps fly the plane. (Murdock is my absolute favorite character) If you have a problem. If no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire THE A-TEAM!!!",1276128000,17,671,4.333333333333333
5738002,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"I am so happy I bought it. It's fantastic. Each season is in it's own regular sized DVD case so you don't have to keep it in the van, which is good 'cause the van is pretty huge. They got rid of the crappy double sided discs and they're now single sided ones. I was very pleasantly surprised with it. It's a quality product and I highly recommend if you want the show and don't have it yet. Right now, amazon has it listed for 89.99, which is less than 20 a season. Good price considering the old releases are over 30 a piece. Great show, great product, and it's looking beautiful on my TV as I write this.",1276128000,57,606,4.100840336134453
5738003,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"Finally, all five seasons in a special limited edition box set!

All I have to say is, 'I love it when a plan comes together!'",1275868800,12,126,4.04
5738004,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"Ok, so let me first say that I do not have this limited box set, but I will be getting it the first day it is released...
However, I do have all 5 seasons that were previously released as seperate seasons...

Now, with that being said... I absolutely loved this show growing up... The show has humor, action & presents a great story of a group of friends that are TRUE HERO'S...

It is a great series for kids or adults and this is a perfect time to buy this series in the unique & limited box set...

Now, I know that you can watch some of the episodes on netflix & the internet, but the discs will look much better on dvd, especially played on a bluray player(even if they are not bluray discs)...

I highly recommend this set & im sure you will watch it over and over just like me...

The new movie coming out looks great too!!!!!!!!!
Thanks...",1274745600,6,847,4.203703703703703
5738005,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"If you haven't watched The ""A"" Team, then what rock have you been hiding under?  :)

This was one of the best shows of the 80's. I grew up watching this show as a kid, the cartoon style violence is exactly right for the time period, and the show worked because of the humor and lightheartedness of the show.

It never quite took itself seriously, understanding that at the time, real violence couldn't be shown on TV (unlike today with shows like 24).

My only complaint would be the price, which is $96 as of this review.  While I loved watching The ""A"" Team, a hundred bucks for a 25 year old TV show strikes me as a bit much.  For $50, I would order it in a heartbeat, but as it is, I'll wait for used copies to come on the market.  Just my thoughts on that.  :)",1271721600,12,765,4.087248322147651
5738006,3,B00CT1HP2Y,"I don't understand why Universal feels a need to make a complete series DVD box set of THE A-TEAM during todays humble economy like Universal has already done with KNIGHT RIDER, MIAMI VICE, & THE INCREDIBLE HULK.

My guess on why Universal is doing this like I figured they would is because of one simple reason called MONEY.

My other hunch on why Universal is making this A-TEAM:Complete Series box set is perhaps to make up or compensate for all the flaws they made on all the individual season DVD box sets by redoing each episode of THE A-TEAM on single-sided discs instead of double-sided discs since the dual-sided discs on the individual season DVD box sets of THE A-TEAM had a lot of episodes skip and/or freeze up just like the case that happened with all the individual box sets of KNIGHT RIDER and MIAMI VICE in order to avoid the skipping and freezing on the discs.

Overall, THE A-TEAM was a cool show about falsely accused Vietnam veteran mercenaries for hire on the lam from the military for a crime they could never prove they didn't commit in the first place who were frequently chased by their overzealous nemesis's Col. Lynch(Bill Lucking)in the 1st Season, Col. Decker(Lance LeGault)from Season 2-4, and Gen. Fullbright(Jack Ging)in the 4th Season.

THE A-TEAM also consisted of 5 different people with special talents who could basically make nothing out of anything.

Col. Hannibal Smith(George Peppard)was the brains and wizard of each mission who often exclaimed ""I love it when a plan comes together"" who was often on the jazz as B.A. often exclaimed during stressful moments of each mission.

Bosco Baracus(Mr. T) aka B.A. for ""Bad Attitude"" was the muscle and talented technician who often threw around the bad guys, but was always so terrified of flying.

Tempelton Peck aka ""Face""(Dirk Benedict) was the handsome con-artist who often got the pretty women which often got Face and the team into a jam, but always seem to pull off a scam with his smooth talking lies to get the team the materials they needed on each mission.

Howling ""Mad"" Murdock(Dwight Schultz)was the eccentric talented pilot & the only member of THE A-TEAM who was not on the run from the Army that lived at the VA Hospital where Face often had to scam Murdock out of.

Amy Allen(Melinda Culea)was THE A-TEAMs sidekick and newspaper reporter from the L.A. Courier who often tagged along with Hannibal, BA, Face, and Murdock on their missions who would also look up important confidential information to help out with their cases in the first 2 seasons, but had departed the show in November of 1983 since Melinda Culea was unfortunately fired in the mid Fall of 1983 just before Amy made her last appearance on the show in early December of 1983.

Tawnia Baker(Marla Heasley)joined the cast and crew of THE A-TEAM in the Winter of 1984 when she replaced Amy in January of 1984 to be the reporter who worked the outside for the team the way Amy used to before Amy was ousted, but then Tawnia ended up leaving this show too in the Fall of 1984, due to sexism off the set.

Therefore this show got stale afterwhile when THE A-TEAM hit its 3rd Season on NBC leaving us to mourn the loss of Amy & Tawnia since there were no more female co-stars on this show anymore to spice things up or to make things more interesting since THE A-TEAM went from being 5 guys to only 4 guys twice, except when THE A-TEAM went back to being just 4 guys again in this shows 1984-85 Season, they pretty much went back to being just 4 guys again with the ousting of Tawnia and Amy.

Therefore as the seasons progressed in the last 3 seasons, this show seemed to keep going more and more downhill and became even more and more stale since the departure of Amy and Tawnia seemed to start killing the show since they didn't have Amy or Tawnia's beauty or spunky personailities around anymore in the last 3 seasons and the last 3 seasons of THE A-TEAM throughout its whole 1983-87 run on NBC weren't nearly as good as the first 2 seasons when this show was in its honeymoon phase when this show became an instant smash during its debut in the Winter of 1983.

So now that Universal has already made complete series DVD box sets for THE A-TEAM, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, & MIAMI VICE, I am now anxious to see if they end up making a complete series DVD box set of MAGNUM, PI & THE ROCKFORD FILES too.",1267574400,14,4379,4.577266922094508
5738007,2,B00CT1HP2Y,"This A-TEAM box set is just another unnecessary gag that Universal is trying to sell to make money during todays grim economy and perhaps Universals way of trying to compensate for all the flaws they made with all the previous individual season DVD box sets with the dual sided discs since alot of them skipped and froze alot just like alot of the individual season DVD box sets of KNIGHT RIDER, MAGNUM, PI, and MIAMI VICE all did with their double-sided discs by redoing each episode on single-sided DVD discs instead just like Universal did with making the complete series DVD box sets of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, and MIAMI VICE.

Overall, THE A-TEAM was a real cool show about 4 modern day Robin Hood mercenaries for hire and 3 out of 4 of THE A-TEAM members were Vietnam vets who were desperados on the lamb from the Army for a crime they didn't even commit in the first place who specialized in impossible situations to the helpless and oppressed people in need, especially when and where the police couldn't help with the help of the eccentric Howling Mad Murdock(Dwight Shultz)which was the only A-Team member who wasn't on the run from the military.

This was an awesome show during the first 2 seasons when they had newspaper reporter Amy Allen(Melinda Culea), but when Amy departed the show in the mid Fall of 1983 after Melinda Culea was fired, the show started getting stale and wasn't nearly as cool to watch without Amy anymore which was briefly replaced by newspaper reporter Tawnia Baker(Marla Heasley)in January of 1984 before she departed the show in September of 1984 due to a fall-out Marla Heasley had with George Peppard.

Therefore THE A-TEAM was starting to lose its thunder and was out of its honeymoon phase of the show when THE A-TEAM kicked off its 3rd Season in the Fall of 1984 when THE A-TEAM went back to only 4 guys since this show no longer had any female co-stars in it since Marla Heasley quit the show after only 8 episodes and Melinda Culea was fired in November of 1983 after the first 9 episodes of THE A-TEAMs 2nd Season.

Therefore the 3rd Season on up left us mourning the loss of Amy and Tawnia making this show became even less and less interesting especially since the departure of Amy and Tawnia made this show even more stale since THE A-TEAM didn't seem to have the same kind of chemistry anymore as it did in the first 2 seasons, especially opposed to THE A-TEAMs 1st Season which was why I stopped watching this show on NBC in January of 1985.",1266969600,2,2504,4.582589285714286

5738055,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"I loved this show when I was a kid, I use to watch it back in the 80's. Face is attracted  to almost every girl the team is around in all the episodes. & often tries to charm them.  You  can  call  him  a  lovesick  puppy.  He  cannot  resist  a  pretty  girl!  B.A Barracks is afraid to fly & won't get on a jet or plane unless he's drugged by Hannibal Smith. No matter how many disguises Hannibal (George Peppard) uses I can always pick him out before he pulls it off. They  often  use  every  trick  in  the  book  almost  when  they  have  to  deal  with Beckkard  &  those  soldiers  who  keeps  chasing  them.  Dwight  Schultz  plays  the  comedian  in  the  show.  Always  funny  &  being  silly.  &  B.A  is  usually  always  annoyed  by  him.  They  got  their  own  ways  of  dealing  with  the  army  &  against  the  enemies  of  the  ones  who's  hired  them.  I  think  I  know  why  Hannibal  Smith  uses  disguises  when  they  get  a  job  when  he  meets  someone  for  the  first  time.  &  says  you've  just  found  the  A Team.  He  tries  to  be  extra  cautious  to  avoid  Decker  or  whoevers  chasing  him  &  the  team.  They  are  smart.  Very  smart.  &  Hannibal  must  use  his  cleverness  to  escape  Decker  when  he's  caught. &  I  think  because  B.A  is  hardly  ever  around  children  Murdock  tries  impressing  him  or  himself.  Because  he  does  act  like  an  8  yr  old.
I  found  out  that  these  discs  sides  A & B  those  that  you  have  to  flip  over  will  not  work  in  every  DVD  player.  Good  show,  but  the  quality  is  lousy.  These  discs  will  freeze  up  on  you  quite  often.  &  why  can't  these  discs  from  seasons  2,3,4  be  like  the  ones  from  seasons  1&5  with  just  a  single  side  to  the  discs?
Whoever  it  is  that  designed  the  discs  for  the  A  team  series  really  messed  up!  Very, Very, Very  Frustrating!!",1427846400,,1911,4.131901840490798

And you always knew the good guys were going to win and the bad guys were going to get humiliated.  Howling Mad Murdock was my childhood hero.  And as an adult, I love and appreciate this show even more.  Anyone who enjoys zany antics, wacky one-liners and good old-fashion fun needs to watch these four guys getting high on ""The Jazz""!!!",1388707200,,451,4.5875

Even Though the 'Plots' are nearly the same in each episode, & the outcome is always the same, it's fun to watch Hannibal, Face, Mad-Dog Murduch, & B.A. try to figure out how to win. Although I haven't watched every episode yet, the ones I have viewed brought back memories for me, of those great 80's shows. All of them are just the way I remember. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest. As for the quality of the DVD's, the ones I watched So-far are OK. I hope the rest are the same way. I have gotten other box set series & there has been instances when all of the DVD's did not work properly, or play right. I just hope this is NOT the case with the ""A-Team Series"".

5738084,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"I'm very happy that I purchased this. It was definitely worth it. What I was lookin' for was not so much the van shaped box or the pictures of the lovely A-Team on the DVD cover-slips, but rather the hours of fun and entertainment to be found on those disks inside each DVD-case.

I was born shortly before the show was cancelled/finished - so I never had a chance to enjoy the show when it originally aired. I did see an episode or two, via re-runs, as a child. It was only recently (a few months ago) that I revisited the show on Netflix - and realized just how much I loved it.

So, for the sake of having the episodes in my possession, I went ahead and spent the money on the complete series. Now it something my family and I can enjoy for years to come.

By the way, the A-Team Van-Box is awesome. Of course, it is cardboard - so I don't expect that it'll last years. But it is a cute throw-back to the show. I mean - who didn't want to own B.A.'s van??",1381190400,,958,4.058201058201059
5738085,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"Loved this show way back when.  I had it on my wish list and I got an email from Amazon that they had it on a one day mark down.  I had to have it!  Now, to find the time to watch it.",1381190400,,183,3.2093023255813953
5738086,5,B00CT1HP2Y,Our son asked us for this series for years and we finally caved in and bought it for him.  He really enjoys watching the various episodes over and over.  A great collection.,1381190400,,173,4.375
5738087,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"Great set for a great show (note: the title of this review is the only catch phrase you will see in this review)

This set is a fantastic 25 disc set that has every episode ever. This set appears to be a re-sale of the complete dvd set that came in the black van packaging. Sadly, this set does not come with the van, though hopefully you won't miss it. The greatly discounted price should help alleviate its decrease in trophy/shelf space stealing ability.

Video
The transfer here is nice, but not perfect. The image is full-frame only. The colors are a bit muted and dull and the image is grainy but it's really hard to get a set from an old show that isn't this way. While it isn't top notch remastered video quality it is still very watchable and didn't detract from my enjoyment at all (this set was borrowed from a friend.)

Audio
Again, don't expect perfection. The audio is a two channel mono sound track. Things are really only difficult to hear when the action scenes are going and the scenes all get really loud and slightly distorted. We can blame them for not having a 5.1 mix but that would be silly. This just might be the best we are going to get.

Extra material
The extras here are very weird. They have taken all of the extras that were on the original single-season releases and put them here. These releases are very strange. I think my favorite special is an episode of ""knight Rider."" I suppose at some point this was something dvd sets were trying to do to spark interest. It is always nice to have bonus content, but I'm sure it is not the feature you were hoping for.

To make things even stranger you get a bonus episode with the season four set which is...an episode of The A-Team from season five! This is very strange until you realize that these discs were probably ported from the original single dvd season sets.

finally, you get a nice special featurette called ""Rumors of Soldiers of Fortune."" This fun addition is a discussion with Stephen J. Cannell. He created the show and it is nice to get his take on creating the show as well as how he felt about the cast.

These features are paltry but at least it's something. A dvd commentary would have been a nice addition. It would have also been interesting if they had something involving Mr. T. He is such a pop culture icon that I'm sure they could have handed him a few bucks to do some sort of special feature or something. Oh well, they have given us every episode ever at a low price and that really should be more than enough for us.

This set makes a great addition to any tv show dvd collectors library. A nice thing to point out about this set versus other sets is that is comes with episodes on a set of single sided discs, unlike double sided discs from previous sets. Double sided discs tend to be poorly manufactured so it is nice to have that upgrade. This set really is worth owning for anybody that is interested in revisiting this classic tv show.",1380067200,3,2951,4.372262773722627
5738088,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"Well I have watched two seasons so far and they have fixed the problems in the second season, the episode where Murdock is shot it doesn't skip and then freeze up. I am so happy with this set. I love the a team and I am very pleased.  great job!!!",1380067200,,247,3.94

5738092,1,B00CT1HP2Y,The storage van was missing. Artwork for season 1 was missing. All discs were in a dvd page holder. All discs were full of dust & smudges all over them.

The packaging for the DVDs is nice, much more compacted than the single season version without compromising the integrity of the discs.  The van itself is remarkably sturdy and the pictures of the cast members peeking out of the windows are hilarious. It reminds you that the van itself almost serves as a 5th member through many of the seasons.

The four characters from the TV show were the real thing as far a acting goes.  That TV series was one of the most remembered and talked about of most of the shows of that decade.  Mr. T was an idol of so many kids.  The show was clean, funny and could be seen by the whole family.  No sex, blood, or even people getting hurt, yet every kid in the neighborhoold wanted an A-Team lunch box.  The movie was very good but just inspired me to buy the whole TV series so I could sit with my Grandchildren and relive what I remembered from my childhood.  Anyone who watched the old TV shows should bring back this action-packed, exciting, character rich and funny in their home.

5738136,3,B00CT1HP2Y,"the good news is that you get every episode of the show over 5 seasons and a few special features to boot.

the bad news is that the packaging is junk.  lets start with the van. the van itself is quite nice, heavy cardboard coated with clear plastic.  its quite strong and looks great.  no complaints there.  the DVDs are removed via the back of the van, the spoiler on the roof lifts (attached with 2 velcro tabs) to reveal the DVD folders inside.

my first issue was one day i noticed i had left the back door open.  i was surprised i did this but thought nothing of it and closed it.  a short time later i saw that it was open again - now i could make no mistake about it, it wasn't me.  a closer look revealed that the half of the velcro tabs on the roof of the van had lifted - the adhesive did not stick as well to the slick plastic exterior of the van as it did the black cardboard on the inside of the back, unfolding panel.  i reminded this with some super glue and have had no further problems.  but should i need to modify and repair a brand new $90 dvd set?

my real beef is with the DVD folders inside the van.  they are of extreme low quality and bonded poorly.  the dvds slip half way into circular perforated cut outs inside the folders, these rip easily and the adhesive lifts.  please be assured i have no children or pets and i have not thrown my van down the stairs.  no doubt this needed to be manufactured such that 5 sets of DVDs could fit inside the van (without the van being massive) but there was some real corner cutting here.  often when i remove a folder (actually, its easier to just remove all 5 and then choose the one you want) DVDs have already fallen out or fall out during removal.

my final gripe is more aesthetic then regarding construction.  while the outside of the van and the outside of the folder depicts the REAL a-team: george peppard, dwight schultz, mr. t and dirk benedict; the inside of the folders is covered with pictures of the actors in the new 2010 film remake.  i have no interest in this film, i have not seen it and do not intend to (Regardless of positive or negative critical review) and interest in this new film has nothing to do with why i purchased this.

i owned season 1 in the stand alone set (extreme rugged quality) but sold it on half.com then bought this.  i could have actually purchased the remaining 4 seasons in that form for less then the $90 price tag on this.  in some ways, i wish i did.",1289088000,25,2467,4.180084745762712

The A-Team is like watching a live action cartoon of Mission Impossible. It never took itself too serious, it even appeared that George Peppard acted as if he were in on the joke -the black gloves???. The team always triumphed over the most impossible and improbable plots as one canny viewer noted on the late great website Jump The Shark, ""they could take scrap metal, a paper clip and a wad of snot and make a tank"". That pretty much sums up the A-Team. Suspend your sense of reality and enjoy, Hannibal, Face, Murdock and BA.

Love the fact that it comes in the A-team van and that the DVD's are one sided and that one season is in one DVD case !! Plan to take a season to school and then trade it in when I get back after the semester for another one ! Awesome deal and package !!! If you love the A-team and what the entire set get this pack, cheaper in the long run and it is perfect !!!",1280620800,,629,3.6666666666666665
5738145,4,B00CT1HP2Y,"I got tired of trying to watch it on hulu between the commercials and the constant buffering. So I actually went out and bought it. The show is just pure escapist fun. It's not meant to be Shakespeare. It is goofy and irreverant and the good guys win. When does that happen in real life?

 The DVD collection comes in a cardboard van, which is really big but the DVDs themselves are the normal size, so you can stash the van in your closet and put the DVDs on your shelf. I would have liked a few more extras, especially a few commentary episodes or a gag reel but I really buy it for the episodes anyway and  what do you expect from a TV show that came out over 20 years ago.

I'd recommend watching an episode or two online, if you've never seen the series, before purchasing the box set. I'll admit it isn't everyone's cuppa but it is one of my guilty pleasures and after a day of petty annoyances it's great to go home and unwind with something a little kooky and campy, that just makes you smile.",1280448000,2,1001,4.197916666666667

5738149,4,B00CT1HP2Y,"The DVD set is amazing, however, I was disappointed that the ""collectible"" limited edition van that the set comes in is not a metal tin, but of paper construction. FYI, the 2010 movie based on the TV series is very cool, with perfect casting.",1279324800,2,242,4.5227272727272725
5738150,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"For me, purchasing the entire series was definitely worth the money. I went to see the movie and the only thing the movie did for me was remind me how much I loved the show, and remind me how great the original actors on the show were. The actors in the movie gave their best attempt, but it just wasn't the same. No one can plan any of the characters like the originals- especially one of my favorites, George Peppard as ""Hannibal"" and Dwight Schultz as ""Murdock""- my 2 favorite characters. If you love the show, having the complete series is a must.",1279152000,3,551,4.359223300970874
5738151,5,B00CT1HP2Y,"What a chance to relive your youth! I remember watching this in the early 80's and how much I enjoyed the explosions, antics and interesting ways they would find to build some monstrosity to win their weekly fight. The DVD series comes in a really cool cardboard box that looks like the van, and it is very sturdy and well made. All the discs are single sided and average 4 shows per disc. Just like the earlier versions there are not many extras if at all. For example Season 2 has a single show from Knight Rider as the extra while Season one had nothing...

You figure each season still sells for $30 average and you get all 5 in this box set with the cool van case for $90! How can you go wrong!!! Save $60 and get this now!",1279152000,,728,4.163120567375887
