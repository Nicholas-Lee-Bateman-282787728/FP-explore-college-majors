1233114,5,B00000JL4Q,"El-Hazard: The Alternate World is quite possibly the best addition to this already incredible series.  Combining a slightly more refined version of the art from El-Hazard 2 with a plot that is so far more complex than any  yet, this DVD is a sure winner.  Also, the DVD format is perfect for anime,  allowing for dubbed or subbed depending on the viewers prefrence.  I  recommend dubbed for El-Hazard, as Pioneer continues to do a stellar job in  the dubbing process.  Over all, a top=notch volume, and I can't wait for  the rest.",935798400,,530,4.673913043478261
1233115,5,B00000JL4Q,"This new series is the perfect continuation for the already magnificiently funny, action packed, and just plain amazing series.  All of your favorite characters have come back, with loves and romantic interests springing up  like wildflowers.  The writers still continue with the sweeping saga, and  the hilarious antics of Makoto and crew, but still put out an emotional  rollercoaster ride.  Truly an excellent piece of anime, with a killer  soundtrack to boot.  I wasn't a J-Pop fan until I heard the soundtrack from  the first release",935107200,,538,5.162790697674419

So a long time ago, when this was first released to VHS, I saw this anime for the first time without having seen the two previous OVA's. It's what hooked me into the series and I've been a fan ever since, so even though this sequel isn't prefect, I do strongly recommend it for anyone who enjoyed the first two.

The DVD starts out introducing a new character, getting you up to speed on what has been happening with the old ones, and picking up where El-Hazard 2 left off. However, if you come into the DVD like I did, without seeing the first two, you'll never quite get filled in on anything that happened in the first OVA, and the second OVA is almost like it never happened. Watching it for the first time, it took me a while to realize that Makoto and Nanami were from Earth, not El-Hazard, and I never figured out Makoto's relationship with Ifurita until I saw the first series. So I strongly recommend seeing the first OVA before any others, as it is the best in my opinion.

While the tone of the first series was very action-oriented, this series becomes a little cartoonier and much less serious but none-the-less entertaining, similar to the Wanderers. The dub is excellent; this is one of the few anime that I prefer to watch in English because I think the dub really added something to it. The animation style is good, a bit dated now but definately still beatuiful.

Which brings me to why this DVD got four out of five stars. I thought the plotlines for most of the characters were pretty engaging; especially Jinnai and Shayla's plotlines, but I HATED all of Qawoor's plots. At first she seemed like an engaging character, but then lots of other character's plots seemed to start revolving around ""Qawoor is so pretty"" or ""Qawoor has spechul pooowers, isn't she neat?"". After a while it all got really nauseating. If you're a fan of Nanami, Shayla or Ifurita from the original series, you're going to hate her. Shortly after Qawoor is introduced she gloms onto Makoto pretty hard, only unlike Nanami and Shayla, she freely admits her feelings for Makoto, and even calls him ""Master Makoto"" or ""Makoto-sama"" if you prefer. She seems to have no faults, even her phobia of bugs ends up working in her advantage, everyone marvels at her strength when she throws Shayla after a bug lands on her. She never really grew on me, and even now I still feel like her character is like a fiction writers Mary-Sue.

This is a decent sequel to an excellent series and I hope you give it a chance, after seeing the OVA's first.",1347926400,,2686,4.495901639344262
7912314,3,B00000JL4Q,"After seeing the first El Hazard series, I found myself feeling utterly lost and confused after I started watching this one. Those of you who've seen the first series may remember that it ended with the four visitors from our world returning to Earth. However, at the beginning of this show, they're suddenly back in El Hazard without any explanation. There's some definete story that got left out here. Anyway, it begins with our hero's anxiously awaiting the arrival of a new prestess, who has the power over water. But she's late in arriving, and Makoto must go out and find her...In the second episode, we meet Elliel's twin brother, and in episode three, the main characters (and one Bugrum,) get transported to yet another world. Anyway, if you can get over not being told how the four travelers from Earth returned to El Hazard, this is a lot of fun.",1085270400,,857,4.682119205298013
7912315,5,B00000JL4Q,"The Alternative World is, acccording to the AIC site, the first TV version of the El Hazard series. It has 13 epidsodes on 4 DVDs, ... US.
Visually speaking, the colors are brilliant with slightly too much red for my eyes (a product of aging and improper equipment set-up). The quality of the art is excellent, and attention to details is good.
Audio wise, the English dub is good (Pioneer has done well with all it's English versions). Unlike some translations, the story works well in English.
The story is easy to follow, even if you haven't seen the original version. I was able to understand what was going on, who was who, and the basic point of the plot. The situations are slightly adult in nature, but it doesn't mean that a younger viewer won't enjoy the series. Overall, the story is funny and entertaining.",1024617600,,818,4.609589041095891
7912316,4,B00000JL4Q,"This is DVD disk 1 of 4.
The series continues with more than a few of the cast from El Hazard getting transported to an alternate dimension version of the El Hazard we've become familiar with.
It's nice to see the characters adapt to their new roles.  For some of them, it's their first time, for the earthlings it's their second.  Don't want to provide too many details that will spoil your experience other than a hint that the ancient weapons are resolved a bit differently in this series.
Technically, this series lacks some of quality of the original series, but it's still worthwhile for die hard El Hazard fans.
Continuity Notes:  El Hazard the ""Alternative World"" is the 3rd El Hazard series.  The original ""Magnificent World"" is the best, so start out with that one.  The ""Alternative World"" series is continuation of ""Magnificent World"" and is not part of the ""Wanderers"" series.
Cautions: This series is the most adult of any of the El Hazard series.  Lots of sexual inuendo like a sitcom, but nothing really happens.",1007856000,,1028,4.747191011235955

7912318,4,B00000JL4Q,"The second TV series (not a third OAV as many people seem to believe) actually picks up where the second OAV left off, rather than following the Wanderers TV series. Speaking as a big fan of the OAVs, I certainly can't complain!
I reccommend watching the OAVs first, as you're dropped right into the story without in-depth development of the characters. However, there we are treated to several new characters, including Quarool/Kauru Towles, the new prietsess of water, and her attendant, Parnasse/Palnus...who just happens to be Alielle's little brother! Where I find Quarool a bit to bland for my tastes (we were spoiled with the hilarious exploits Miz!), but Parnasse and Emperor Dall Narciss of Certaria are just too perfect!! They provide for the majority of the laughs in this volume!
The visuals in the Alternative World are stunning, as with the OAV series. With the inclusion of 3 new worlds, it makes for some beautiful, imaginative backdrops. However, the story is unapologetically thin to begin with: Makoto & Co., during the induction of the new priestess of water, are split apart and sent to what appears to be three separate dimensions. Makoto, Nanami, and Quarool are in the dank, polluted kingdom of Creteria run by the stupified Hotohori-esque emperor Dall Narciss; Jinnai, Shayla, Fatora, the girl-chasing Parnasse, and Alielle are in a frozen tundra environment inhabited by maggot-like bugs; and the Fujisawas, Afura, and Rune Venus are on what appears to be a floating mountain (too cool!!) Volume 1 sets the tone for the rest of the series: think of it more as an introduction than a real plot-mover. I personally can't wait to watch the rest of this series! The characters may not gain as much depth as they did during the OAVs, but the way they interact is both interesting and hysterical (especially when Jinnai stumbles across Shayla-Shayla in the ice world!!), and the animation is a small, but apparent, improvement over the OAVs.",997488000,,1961,5.0
7912319,5,B00000JL4Q,"Fans of the original El Hazard OAV will probably jump up and down in delight when they watch this recent series that continues the saga of those who dwell in the magnificent world of El Hazard.  Though a bit slower going  than the first OAV, the episodes in this tape are vital to watch in order  to understand the rest of the story later, so if you think you can just buy  any old tape in the middle of the series, don't count on it.  I helps  greatly to have seen the first OAV (""El Hazard: the Magnificent  World"" series) due to the fact that some ""past events"" are  referred to, but it's not absolutely necessary.  The characters, as always,  are widely diverse and each has his or her own unique quirkyness.  The fact  that all the voice actors returned for this new installment is a treat  (although Fujisawa's voice is a little overdone in the beginning in  comparison to the first series).  This anime has great promise and is  recommended for any anime fan that enjoys fantasy elements as well as the  occasional joke here and there.  If you buy this one, be SURE to also get  the second volume as well, as it perfectly complements this one.",950745600,,1150,4.416267942583732
