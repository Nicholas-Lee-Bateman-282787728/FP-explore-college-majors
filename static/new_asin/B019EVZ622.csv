8745020,3,B019EVZ622,Nice image quality for The Embalmer [and co-feature] a macabre but implausible black & white thriller set in Venice which I discovered by perusing Sinister Cinema's catalogue.  The Red Headed Corpse was a more worthwhile viewing with it's cuckold artist protagonist and the sexy wife who may or may not be real.  My only real qualm is that the paintings used in the film are not that great,1513728000,,389,4.705882352941177
8745021,4,B019EVZ622,"Not so much about what the stories are about since that's easily accessible but Ill just say I enjoyed The Embalmer more than the Red-Headed Corpse, as I prefer Gothic ,atmospheric horror over Euro-Sleaze.
The product is good overall, now The Embalmer is presented 16 x 9 in its original 1:78:1 aspect ratio and looks good overall. Yes there is some print damage, speckles lines here and there, but it's still the best it ever looked.
The Red-Headed Corpse aka The Sensuous Doll  is presented in 1:66:1 and to be honest, it is not the best looking print. Its not a completely washed up source, but it reminded me of VHS quality to a certain degree. It's grainy, with vertical lines here and there. You can still watch and enjoy the movie, and the lovely Erika Blanc showing her stuff.
Basically (to me) The Embalmer is the better film with the better print quality. This new DVD comes with a trailer for the Embalmer as well. The back of the DVD is written by yours truly !
Enjoy",1461196800,4,979,4.5
