... but, if you are from the United States, beware: the collection I'm reviewing (still a solid 5 star product!) is Region 3 (Southeast Asia...) and will, most likely, not play on a US DVD player.

But that only means you may have to assemble your own 6 pack and that's really not so bad, especially with the Criterion Collection available for 2 or 3 of the titles (and, one hopes, more to follow!)

Be well.",1354838400,,675,4.471544715447155
