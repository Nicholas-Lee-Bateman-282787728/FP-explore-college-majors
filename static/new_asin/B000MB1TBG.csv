this is not a rental type movie. I've seen this over 60 times in my lifetime and I still continue to watch it. Last night, I just thought of a scene that it wasn't even Stephen Chow part, and I was just saying the script since I know it by heart now. My brother also continued the dialogue and wanted to rewatch the movie last night. Too bad i was tired.

Watch it as it is one of his very best work",1326758400,,638,4.055555555555555
