8259907,5,B0015U0R1G,"Awesome show, especially when he plays the clarinet, and
to remember seeing him run the band for Elton john and
the helecasters. I would love to see john in a fusion band
really going for it. His versatility is matched only by
his skill. Not many are any better to watch and having
attended one of his private lessons, im sure I won't be
in front of anyone any better anytime soon,.
Saw the organ, the sax on bitch is back, the clarinet
on my favorite tune here, and both his rock electric
guitar and his django acoustic are really like hobbies because
hes best at his country pickin, very albert lee.
Technically and physically gifted like tommy Emmanuel
only far more gifted in his writing in my opinion.
hes a lot more than a hired gun. his style his overall
package, not many come close. very few are as technically
gifted and I have sat in front of so many, gambale the
king of gift, al di meola incredible speed and stamina,
shawn lane jimmy Hendrix, alan hodsworth like a million times,
mike stern, joe satriani all the g3 all the old rock all the
surfer country pickin, and flamingo guitarists of my lifetime
and I have favorites in many categories, john is one that
rises to the top level in several, and not many can do that.
It was like hearing shawn lane play teentown for the first time.
Greatness is hard to find and once discovered it should be savored.",1370995200,,1368,4.41106719367589
8259908,5,B0015U0R1G,Bought this as a gift.  My husband says he loves this - he's very happy with all of it. Would order again for friends and relatives.,1327017600,2,132,4.076923076923077
8259909,5,B0015U0R1G,"OK, first the disclaimer: I have produced John J. in concert at my non-profit ([...]) for each of the past three years. So, this year, he won a Grammy. He did the sound track and appears as Django in the movie,Head in the Clouds. And, yes he toured with Elton John and had the band The Hellecasters. Back to the movie for a minute:(No, he is not as much fun to look at as P.Cruz and C.Theron!)  He channels Django and Grappelli with unmatched grace. His skills as a player on guitar, bouzouki, and clarinet are phenomenal. Other musicians love to work with him and it shows. He never ""mails it in"" and he appreciates you as his audience. Get the picture, he is the complete package. You will love the DVD and the disc. Well recorded live in both audio and video categories.",1238630400,7,773,4.368055555555555
