8232094,5,B000YDLVXS,This DVD is very informative.  I am new to Essential Oils.  I will have to watch this video several times and take notes.  The oils are expensive and there are a lot that you must purchase.  Young Living oils are the highest quality.  They are expensive but you can trust this company.  I can't wait to try this on my horse.,1404086400,3,324,4.229508196721311

8232096,4,B000YDLVXS,"The demonstrations are very clear and easy to follow. I felt very confident applying the oils to the horses after watching the dvd. (And they loved it!) It doesn't go very in depth about each of the oils. So, I highly recommend further training in Raindrop with Young Living if you aren't all that familiar with essential oils. If you already have training from Young Living and want to learn to apply it to your equine companions this dvd is perfect!!",1367798400,,452,4.592592592592593
8232097,5,B000YDLVXS,"For anyone interested in oil therapy for horses this is THE ONE TO GET. Heather Mack knows her stuff. She explains which oils to use what and where to put them in a very slow and comfortable way, for those new to oils she is the ""go to girl"". Spend the money you won't regret it.",1331424000,5,279,4.0
