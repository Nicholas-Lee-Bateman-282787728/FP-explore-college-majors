8644376,4,B00IP14JFI,"""Eden and After"" (1970) is directed by Alain Robbe-Grillet. This was Robbe-Grillet's first colour film. He explored colour in some scenes by referencing artists like Mondrian and Malevich. The film begins in a cafe named Eden which looks like a 3-D version of a Mondrian painting. The film itself is a kind of pastiche of an adventure film where a group of French students travel to Tunisia and play psychological and sexual games which take on a hallucinatory quality after they experiment with a powder that a mysterious Dutchman introduces them to.

This set also has a second film called ""N. Took the Dice""(1972) which was made up from alternate takes and unused footage from ""Eden and After"". The film was constructed using ideas found in aleatoric music, which leaves some elements of the composition up to chance. By rolling a dice Robbe-Grillet constructed an order to the scenes.

This film looks excellent and apparently was remastered and cleaned up of dust. There is also a thirty-one minute interview with director about the two films.",1435968000,4,1048,4.982857142857143
8644377,4,B00IP14JFI,"This is a terrifically wild, erotic, psychedelic French movie that embraces the kind of existential narrative one would expect from the art house films of the 1960's and 70's. If you liked Last Year at Marienbad [written by the director of this film] but wanted more sex and an even more complex plot involving memory and drug-induced reality [and color!] then this the movie for you. Visually - in Blu-ray - it is stunning. It's got a good interview with the director Alain Robbe-Grille as an extra as well as an alternative cut to the film, which is shorter but different. Worth buying.",1419811200,8,588,4.718446601941747
