310563,4,6301118251,"According to the screen credits, this was made for film.  Thankfully it does not go off on some filmitization experiment.  Actually they might have been too conservative for everyone's liking since it looks exactly like a  stage production, only with film like camera work.  A greater number of  people can comment on the ballet itself since it has been on VHS for some  time.  I will confine my comments mostly to issues with its  reproduction.
I agree with the Chicago person's comment that the quality  of the transfer is not the best, and will go much further.  Despite my  criticisms, I hope everyone will keep in mind that I would recommend this  as a great DVD to own.
Unfortunately this DVD was not transferred from  the film, but from a video of the film.  This means that you will see scan  lines and other video artefacts.  Either because of this or poor DVD  compression, the picture sharpness is muddy, and trails of movement are  visible as on the Swan Lake DVD.  Other problems that would be easy to  restore are inconsistencies between exposures on the frames and frame shake  (revealed by static objects appearing to vibrate).  Hopefully, the next  release will be digitally remastered directly from film with better quality  compression, and digital remastering of the audio track to DTS.  A plus  would be if they restored the film print by removing the dust and  scratches.
DVD features were not entirely ignored, but could be  significantly improved:
""Chapter"" Indexing: 18 points in the ballet can  be accessed.  This is much too few.  Not just the scenes, but each  particular dance  should be indexed as with Kultur's Swan Lake DVD.
Music History, Ballet Synopsis and Biographies of Nureyev, Fonteyn and  Prokofiev have about 10 pages each, in text easily read from a  television.
There are no language features.  At bare minimum, the  synopsis for each act should be translated into the typical European  languages as well as those of other ballet loving markets such as Chinese.  Going further, a ballet commentary as a separate audio track would be  especially welcome.  Such commentaries are common on great films by  Hitchcock or Bergman and could be done cheaply.  Commentaries enrich the  experience of audiences who are interested in gathering a fuller  appreciation of this art form, and both features would pay the producers  back since it would extend their market into larger  audiences.

Nureyev and Fonteyn's Romeo and Juliet is one of the  ballet movie that has all the ingredients. Based on Shakespear and  Prokofiev's masterpiece, McMillan's choreography fully conserved the  dramatic intensity. Nureyev and Fonteyn's performance is a treat for anyone  who is in love.
The costume is dazzling! This is something hard to find  in Russian productions.

310566,3,6301118251,"I saw this movie in 1966 and found it wonderful. It was the only opportunity I ever had of seeing Nureyev dance with Fontayne, who was certainly the main motivation for his defection. The strength of the movie  is in the fact that Fontayne is in her 40's when she dances this Juliet,  but her wonderful dancing captures the lightness and youth of Juliet. I  agree with Malkin, too many zoom-in shots prevent you from appreciating the  ""blocking"" of the scenes (in ballet one creates a full picture  for the audience), and it shows every wrinkle in Dame Margot's face. One  kept wishing the cameramen had ""backed off"" so that the audience  could appreciate the full impact of this performance.

310809,5,6301118251,"I enjoy this ballet, it's ever-so-English, very much in the style of a Covent Garden production.  I won't repeat what good comments others have posted here, but did want to suggest adding one or two later versions to your shelf.  Rudolf thought about R&J for a lot of years after this first one was filmed, and eventually he created a darker, more adult, and supremely gorgeous version in the early 1980's.

There are two films of the Nureyev choreography that I know of:  one is the Paris Opera Ballet DVD, mid-1990's, I believe, choreographed by Nureyev (but not with him in it).  It is visually dramatic from the beginning, and puts you on notice that something heavy will happen.  Also available, but harder to find, is the VHS from about 1982 starring him and Carla Fracci, a La Scala production, all Italian dancers except Rudolf. It's the same staging as POB, and gives you the opportunity to see Rudolf in action.  He's 44, and no longer boyish, but he pairs up well with Carla Fracci.  That woman has no trouble keeping up with him.

Owning both the earlier Fonteyn/Nureyev vehicle and one or both of the others makes for a nice R&J collection.  Fonteyn is girlish and dies a fairly ladylike death, no gut-wrenching silent howls.  Twenty years later, the other two ballerinas allow themselves to be not-so-pretty when they discover Romeo is lost to them forever.  In particular the portrayal of Juliet by Monique Loudieres (POB) is spot-on, her finale really gets to you.

I like the La Scala production, Carla Fracci and Nureyev together move fast, a lot of great lifts.  They dance with great physicality, and a few of Rudolf's solos let you see what made him so hot in the first place.",1301616000,6,1697,4.6891891891891895
310810,5,6301118251,"That Nureyev (according to one of his major biographers) was ""disappointed"" in the film, that MacMillan left the Royal Ballet shortly after his intense unhappiness with Management's forced changes in casting for the production of the Ballet (and, therefore, in his design for it), should have no relevance to the potential viewer's decision to see this film. It is among the best films comprised of dance ever made.
Whatever changes may have been wrought, MacMillans choreography is intrinsically modern to the core, Nureyev and Fonteyn are, well, Nureyev and Fonteyn, Prokoviev's music has never been more suitably complemented. It is pure joy to watch.
I would not have thought to comment on it, that it is listed as a 1966 film should say it all; however, the point has been made by some reviewers, and I know it to be a matter of concern to some viewers, particularly, I suppose, those who have accustomed  themselves to watch and listen only to the most high tech films on the most high tech equipment. This DVD does not seem to have been processed to suit their taste. If that is a concern with you, if you are going to be annoyed by technical deficiencies or sometimes erratic cutting of the final print, then perhaps you should buy a filmed performance that is contemporary. Why buy one that will irritate you. For those who are adaptable, I would certainly recommend relaxing and enjoying it.",1278115200,5,1401,4.813278008298755
310811,5,6301118251,"Now near enough to 40 years old, this production is still glorious. Nureyev is dazzling - check the balcony scene. And while Fonteyn was over 40 when she danced this part, she can still convince us that she is a young girl in love for the first time. And they can still make me cry at the end.",1247443200,3,293,4.068965517241379
310812,5,6301118251,"Having seen most of the available DVD versions of Romeo and Juliet, I still greatly prefer the more traditional MacMillan choreography, which sticks closely to Prokofiev's original conception in his scoring, to either Nureyev's idiosyncratic 1995 Paris National Opera, with Loudieres and Legris, or Grigorovich's radically revisionist 1988 Bolshoi, with Bessmertnova and Mukhamedov.

I'm not a dancer, and will leave appraisals of technique and skill to other reviewers. I always appreciate Ivy Lin's very perceptive and engaging discussions of many ballet performances, and several other reviewers have added helpful commentary here.

For those who are interested in the music of Prokofiev, conductor John Lanchbery's reading of this score is one of the best and most satisfying ever recorded on either film or CD; for reasons that I've never quite fathomed, Prokofiev often tends to be badly misunderstood by many Russian conductors. (And by all means avoid any Russian attempts at Stravinsky, which in my experience tend to be uniformly uncomprehending.)

Conducting for ballet is always a little tricky - do you adjust the meter and dynamics to suit the choreographer and ballet master, or do you make them adjust to your reading of the score? Here Lanchbery, choreographer Kenneth MacMillan and ballet director Frederick Ashton have worked together with each other and with film director Paul Czinner in perfect harmony to produce the best possible integrated performance of music, dance, acting, and film, of any ballet that I'm aware of.

Yes, acting. As Ms. Lin suggests, Nureyev's sensitivity as an actor is at least as accomplished as his skill as a dancer. Fonteyn magically sheds her years to become 14 years old again, entirely inhabiting rather than 'playing' the role of Juliet.

Pay particular attention to both David Blair as Mercutio and Desmond Doyle as Tybalt. Blair's teasing and mocking demeanor is wonderful throughout, the best on film. Doyle's cold haughty rage, in his every stance and expression, is a wonder to behold. His Tybalt has never been equaled or even approached in any other performance of this ballet. The choreography and the dancers' gestures, large and small, in the entire fight scene are a major highlight of this production and put all other versions to shame.

As many reviewers have suggested, Kultur Video has here (as with all of their releases) simply made a direct transfer to DVD not from Czinner's original film stock but instead from their unfortunately rather grainy VHS print, with no attempt having been made to remaster the video copy. I have no idea who owns the rights to this Embassy Pictures film, but a remastered edition of this irreplaceable performance taken from film stock is desperately needed.

For those viewers who care more about audiovisual clarity - you know who you are - than the quality of the performance itself, I recommend the 2000 Ferri/Corella/La Scala release over the 1984 Ferri/Eagling Royal Ballet, both of which use the traditional MacMillan choreography. The 1984 Royal Ballet is very nicely done; the 2000 La Scala is superb in all respects - dancing, acting, 'chemistry', sets and costumes, orchestral conducting and playing, and filming. But neither can hold a candle to this 1966 Fonteyn/Nureyev performance.",1241308800,5,3301,5.240530303030303
310882,5,6301118251,"Well, having finally gotten a ""round tuit"" it is time to write a review on Romeo and Juliet, starring Margot Fonteyn and her understudy young Rudolf Nureyev. You see I am using her name first, when most everyone else puts his name first. She was here first and besides, she's a Lady, with a capital ""L"". I am not going to mention that she was forty-five when this ballet was filmed, and I don't want you to even think about her age. Just think of her as a ballerina dancing the part of a young girl, not quite ready to marry someone she doesn't even know, much less love.

Since this ballet was filmed in 1966, you might think this DVD would be of poor quality, but actually it is very good quality. I have seen ballets filmed in the 21st century which have much poorer quality. The resolution is good, the color is good and the sound is, the sound is, the sound is OK, but Mono. Most filmed versions are going to be in good focus, with good color, etc. It is the transfer to another medium which causes poor quality of reproduction. This IS a filmed version, done at Pinewood Studio, so you won't hear pointe shoes or applause, but you do hear sword play in the fight scenes. The running time is 130 minutes, with the complete score. There is a scene by scene synopsis, biographies of the principles and the composer, plus a history of the music. Oh by the way, they do add some ""canned"" applause at the end which is sort of tacky.

For once, Nureyev is not made up to be more beautiful than the leading Lady, like he was in their version of Swan Lake. This ballet is good enough to be your only version if you only want one. You certainly need something staring this famous couple, and preferably one in which the male part cannot outshine the female part. There are lots of good R&Js on the market, but none with better dancing, which is why we buy these ballets. This version is loaded with talent besides the principles, like a gorgeous Georgina Parkinson (now with American Ballet Theatre, and recently playing the Queen Mother in their Swan Lake) as Rosaline, Anthony Dowell, Monica Mason, Jennifer Penny ( A beautiful ""Manon"" with Anthony Dowell, her lover), and Gerd Larson, just to name a few.  You won't go wrong, buying this ballet.........Richard.",1234224000,3,2260,4.480582524271845
310883,5,6301118251,"I have been looking over the multiple silly reviews of this DVD. The fact is that Dame Margot and Nureyev were among the greatest dancers of the past century, they have both sinced passed away, and this so very moving performance of one of Prokofiev's most masterful and human scores is what we are left with. I saw them do it more than once at the Met (Royal Ballet visits) while I was a student at Juilliard, and it was a life changing event. Dame Margot seems a 14 year old in gesture despite the 40+ year old face. If that is hard to see, please look deeper.

So, forget that it is NOT the Chicago Symphony, it is NOT a modern videotaping. I don't focus on unimportant flaws while listening to Cortot play Schumann! Let us thank God for great Art...",1224633600,10,753,4.302816901408451
310884,5,6301118251,"Fonteyn and Nureyev were terrific actors and matchless dancers. I am sure that there were and are better technicians in some steps, but no two people created the charged atmosphere and told a story better or more beautifully than they did. One can actually feel the joy in the balcony scene, the poignant parting in the bedroom scene (Nureyev's expression is priceless), and the tragic heartbreak in the last scene. Prokoviev's music is unsurpassed,
 I do agree that this treasure needs to be digitally re-mastered for another edition. Otherwise, it doesn't get much better than this.",1216080000,2,584,5.083333333333333

The detail of the scenery, costuming and dancing in this production are all eye catching and beautiful.  Very noticeable are the wonderful steps and leaps of the male dancers, as they not only support the ballerinas but perform with perfection themselves.  Also of note are the expressive body language and facial expressions. This DVD is treasured!",1216080000,2,506,5.072289156626506
310886,5,6301118251,"Dame Margot bounces onto the stage like a ten year old in her first scene. Since her agility, energy and acting permit her to perform the entrance with that elan, you believe in her Juliet right away. Sometimes Fonteyn flutters like a leaf, sometimes she floats, sometimes she rushes toward her love. It's been said that she's older here and past her prime. I can't see any flaw in her performance. She pirouettes, she jumps, she's always in the right place for lifts, and she stays on point endlessly and effortlessly. In one place just the movement of her hand and arm is a dance.

Nureyev is wonderful to watch. I'm not a balletomane, but his jumps with flashing footwork are fabulous. I can't help wondering if he could have turned in the air. He dances with every bit of his body, not forgetting that his hands and feet are a part of his performance. In one place especially, he and Fonteyn use their hands so expressively that I don't even remember what else they were doing. I have never seen the change from Rosalind to Juliet so convincingly demonstrated.

Like opera singers, ballet dancers sometimes do and sometimes don't act.  Fonteyn and Nureyev act as if they had studied drama as well as ballet. Their chemistry is so convincing that you forget that there can have been no romance between them offstage. The romance between their characters sometimes yearns, sometimes blazes, and sometimes explodes in rapture.

That's all the more convincing because in filming, while the camera does move in and out in ways that make sense, the distances are well chosen. (This is a studio recording.) Whoever filmed this avoided tight closeups, but moved in close enough for the moment to be touching. That bit of good judgment avoided the jarring notes that sometimes mar a filmed performance when the best woman for the role is not only older than the character, but also older than the man who is playing the romantic lead.  I had seen that recently in a different situation, and was worried about it here, but the performance is delightful throughout, and I was never bounced out of the story by a badly chosen closeup.

In the curtain calls you do see for yourself that Fonteyn is materially older than Nureyev, but at that point they are themselves, so it's appropriate.

I thought I had enough versions of Romeo and Juliet, and I was a little nervous about buying this. I'm very glad I did!

Nureyev and Fonteyn dancing Romeo and Juliet is a great performance of a great ballet. Don't JUST get it to see two of the most famous ballet dancers in history dance with their most effective partner: get it because you'll love to watch it. Get it because here, the movement really does tell the story without words, which is what ballet is about.

The brand name of fame is immaterial, but that's because it's this performance and others like it that created the fame to begin with.",1202342400,6,2886,4.665354330708661

Then, the music by Prokofiev is perfect, exquisiely toned to evoke love, excitement, sorrow; it's as excellent as the play or the ballet. And the protagonists are perfectly cast, with an added poignancy coming from what one knows of their tragic personal lives, doomed lovers indeed: Nureyev dying from AIDS, Fonteyn descending into poverty and loneliness (see Tony Palmer's excellent bio), David Blair (the perfect Mercutio) dying suddenly at 43.

There are many truly memorable moments: the formal stepping out of the males and then the females at the grand ball, the High Renaissance itself; the duel between Tybalt and Mercutio, and the latter's dying moments; the exuberant mass dances in the marketplace. I especially liked the three harlots for their devil-may-care elan..",1176163200,8,929,5.312925170068027
310889,5,6301118251,"This film by Paul Czinner dates from 1966 and was the first time he used his new technique of filming a live performance.  Although these roles became synonymous with the two legendary principals, Kenneth MacMillan created this ballet on Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable, two of the Royal Ballet's rising young stars of the era. Seymour, however, took ill right before the premier and Fonteyn took over - and when she took over, Nureyev naturally became her partner.  It was bitter for Seymour and Gable, but they had no choice but to become the second cast. Although Fonteyn was about 46 at this time her technique was still equal to the choreography, and although she does not look young, her ability to project the impulsive, youthful character of the young Juliet is remarkable.  For this feat alone, the film is worth having.  Nureyev was at the height of his powers, only 6 years past his defection from the Kirov Ballet, and his passionate response to Fonteyn is also one of the strengths of this performance. I must acknowledge here that he has never been one of my favorite dancers and his self-involvement on stage is one reason why, but here credit must be given where it is due.  The blending of his passion and Fonteyn's dramatic and lyric gifts make this familiar story riveting.  The supporting cast is no less extraordinary in dramatic conviction - they could serve as a lesson in dance-theater to today's young dancers who seem to rely on very broad gestures to convey story, when not dancing.  Although past his technical prime, David Blair is superbly cynical as Mercutio, and Derek Rencher imbues Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, with a deadly hatred. Without exception, this is a cast that brings the characters to life and whose attention to dramatic values honors their country's literary as well as balletic heritage.  I enjoyed Nicholas Georgiadis's sets, although they came in for some criticism at the time as being ""heavy"".  This is most definitely worth seeing and keeping - it was probably one of the last performances of Fonteyn's where she was still fully in command of her technique and did not need choreography tailored to what she still could do.  On a personal note, I prefer this ballet version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" to all the others I have seen, and that includes the legendary one produced by the Kirov in the 1930s, for which Prokofiev wrote this score, and which starred the immortal Galina Ulanova (this is also available on film, I believe).",1168300800,7,2480,4.827830188679245

310928,5,6301118251,"Tonight I watched Romeo and Juliet again, this time with two of my granddaughters.  I have seen it with my parents, with my wife and three children, and now with my grandchildren. I attended the movie in Washington, in Boston, and in Albany, NY many years ago.  This version has become part of my life, as have its stars, Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn.  Why I have not reviewed it before, I do not know.

This Royal Ballet version of Romeo and Juliet is so fine, so spectacular, so moving, and so incrediblly beautiful that in my opinion there is no other ballet that can compare with it.  First there is the poignantly tragic love story of Shakespeare. Add to it the hauntingly expressive, classic-yet-modern music of Prokofiev.  Stir in Kenneth MacMillan's sensitive and exuberant choreography.  And as the supreme touch, have it danced by the most exhilarating male dancer who every performed, in partnership with the most delicate and vulnerable ballernina of the past century.  Here you have the masterpiece of all masterpieces.  A ballet that puts other ballets to shame with their weak plots and lack of emotional substance.

My two favorite scenes are the balcony scene, and the scene where Romeo dances with a lifeless Juliet.  The first exudes love and passion, as Nureyev and Fonteyn are transported by their new-found love to a height beyond all measure.  In the second, your heart freezes and you strain to hold back tears as Romeo tries to coax the life back into Juliet by dancing with her limp but still graceful form. There are no touchingly valid moments such as these in any other ballet I have seen.

The superb costumes are worthy of a Zefferelli production, although this is not one, of course.  The scenery is adequate but not impressive.  But most important, all the dancers communicate a vitality that is convincing and contagious.  The swordplay is amazing in its complexity and realism. Tybolt's death and his wife's grief are overdone with just the right touch of modernity.

But mainly, Nureyev and Fonteyn bring each scene they dance into brilliant flower.  And when they dance together something of the mystery and tragedy of their two very different lives comes to the surface and animates their performance, giving it a realism that communicates their deep emotion for each other.

This is heartfelt and heart-wrenching art. When it finishes, one is exhausted and drained, but also inspired and delighted that this one-of-a-kind performance was recorded so that one may enjoy it over and over again.",1114732800,97,2536,4.924705882352941
310929,1,6301118251,I bought the dvd because I love Prokofiev and Nureyev so I was pretty sure the combination would be great. Is it ever. Margot Fonteyn is also exceptional. I have a version of Romeo & Juliet recorded from A&E network also the Royal Ballet from Covent Garden and must say I had my reservations about Juliet in this version because Alessandra (I forget the rest of her name)was such an innocent Juliet. I'm very glad I have this ballet but admit that I would like to have the later one as well to round out my collection. As far as I know the second isn't on dvd or vhs.,1069804800,2,567,4.2110091743119265
310930,5,6301118251,"In 1965 I saw Nureyev and Fonteyn dance 'Romeo And Juliet' at the Arie Crown Theater in Chicago (I still have the program) and can attest to Maltin's comment that ""zoom lens is a poor substitute for live performance"".  While those gorgeous moments will remain forever with me I would not forgo for an instant the pleasure of viewing what Czinner captured in his 1966 film of this ballet.  This is dance drama as only Nureyev and Fonteyn could create it, and I don't believe it has ever been surpassed.
MacMillan created his 'Romeo And Juliet' not for Nureyev and Fonteyn but for Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable, and Gable was bitterly disappointed when his role was given over to Nureyev who didn't hesitate to inject his own changes into the choreography. Nureyev was perfectly cast as a randy Renaissance playboy suddenly entranced by Juliet's demure girlish innocence so perfectly projected by Fonteyn.  She was forty-six at the time yet through her dancing she transformed herself into a romantically inspired teenager.  The experience of this in the theater was stunning, as one is not diverted by camera close-ups, but even in the film I find myself thoroughly convinced by her portrayal. Of all the ballets that Nureyev and Fonteyn danced together this one most perfectly captured the contrasts in their personas that made their partnership so unique.  He has been described as ""fire"", she as ""light"", and the synergy between them was unforgetable in this ballet.
In his choreography MacMillan does a masterful job of characterizing Romeo who in the opening scene makes a play for Tybalt's girlfriend, Rosaline, dances in abandon with the harlots of the town, and then pursue Rosaline to the Capulet's ball.  In contrast we meet Juliet playing with a doll in her anteroom and shying timidly away from her suitor, Paris.  But at the ball Juliet plays the mandolin and Romeo, intruding himself, dances for her generating a spellbinding attraction between them that flowers into the balcony scene.  Juliet gives herself to him, timidly at first but then freely in an exquisite pas-de-deux by which all subsequent performances by other dancers must be judged.
Czinner's film of this ballet is filled with memorable moments; Desmond Doyle's outstanding portrayal of the menacing; treacherous Tybalt; David Blair's rendition of Mercutio's death; Romeo and Juliet's parting pas-de-deux filled with tenderness, longing, and grief (Shakespeare's words, ""Oh thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?"" fill the moment). But of all it is perhaps the tomb scene that remains the most vivid.
Hearing of Juliet's death Romeo invades the Capulet's tomb, dispathes Paris, and mourns over Juliet's body. In Nureyev's lifts of Fonteyn's limp body he recreates a semblance of their balcony and bedroom trysts, pathetically trying to dance life into her once again, until overcome at last he takes poison and dies.  Juliet awakens and now it is Fonteyn's turn to match Nureyev's sorrow and desperation as she realizes the tragic consequences of her failed plan.  The poignancy of their deaths is so well realized the one felt a sense of relief when at last Rudi and Margo materialized before the curtain to take their tumultous curtain calls.  This ballet is a perfect marriage of Prokofiev's sumptuous score, MacMillan's evocative choreography, the exquisite dancing of Nureyev and Fonteyn, and we are most fortunate to have it all preserved in Czinner's film, a ""must own"" for every lover of dance.
One might indeed believe that Rudi defected in June 1961 to dance with Margo but the truth is that he was about to be arrested by the KGB in Paris and sent back to Russia. He threw himself upon the mercy of the French police, escaped, danced with the Cuevas company in Paris, and then with the Royal Danish Ballet.  He didn't dance with Fonteyn until February 1962.",1046304000,25,3853,5.021943573667712

Indeed, the dancing is superb and it is probably difficult to see something like this one in our days.  However, Margo F. is desperately and hopelessly old here, and although her dancing is perfect, I could not totally believe her interpretation because she was playing a 14 years old girl. She is well over 40 when this was filmed and it showed.  Somehow, I also noticed some rigidity in her movements.  I agree with some critics who say that she reigned in Royal ballet for too long and was careful to destroy all competition.  The result is this, although technically perfect but not very believable performance. Nevertheless, it is still a great one.",1019952000,10,740,4.841269841269841

I also thought the direction was not the best--very little thought given to long, medium or close shots, and seemingly shot with only one camera. I was fortunate enough to see the real McCoy in its second year of production and this DVD does not capture the excitement, beauty or emotion of that performance. Should you buy it? Yes. In spite of it's shortcomings, it is an extraordinary record of an extraordinary dance team. And I don't mean just Fontayne and Nureyev. It is quite possibly the Royal Ballet at its best. Don't overlook David Blair, Monica Mason and Gerd Larson when you watch this one.",994896000,23,703,4.67741935483871
310934,3,6301118251,"First, it should be said that every time Fonteyn and Nureyev danced together, there was a chemistry that transcended the choreography. Even with Fonteyn at the close of her amazing career in this production, those qualities of interpretation and connection shine through. Nureyev's dancing is solid, but as with many MacMillan ballets, he spends much time as a display pedestal for his partner.  However, when Fonteyn, especially, is on screen, it is impossible to tear your eyes away: she truly was one of the most charismatic dancers of the last century.
That said, I must confess to a great deal of frustration with this DVD. There was no effort made to re-master, as far as I can see.  Also, as becomes obvious from the intro titles (with the edges chopped off), the coversion from PAL to NTSC was done haphazardly at best. In some scenes, dancers are partially cut-off from view, in others the frame speeds result in an almost jerky quality.
Czinner, like many others in the past, tried very hard to turn the ballet production into a movie production, and fails miserably at times. Close-ups are filmed when MacMillan's spectacular corps choreography is occurring, so you miss some wonderful dancing. Often, the effort to capture ""drama"" for the movie screen ends up detracting terribly. One day, somebody will figure out that the best way to film ballet is to simply plop your camera in the best seat in the house with a wide angle lens and let it run.
Would I purchase this again? Certainly. As a bit of history it has great value.  However, I see no reason to spend the extra money on the DVD version -- it's no better than film, and the ""extras"" are nothing that you couldn't find elsewhere, and in a better format (""I am a Dancer"", the VHS with Nureyev, comes to mind.) So save your DVD dollars and go for tape on this one.",984528000,62,1833,4.651234567901234
310935,5,6301118251,"The music of this ballet is brilliant, delicate, extremely expressive and dramatic. Every moment in the show finds its strength and its emotion in the music itself. All the scenes where a crowd occupies the stage are enriched with popular dances, be it on the market place or during the ball at the Capulets. But we are waiting for the more intimate scenes with Romeo and Juliet and those scenes become dainty, light, but never joyful, because we feel under the surface the drama that is coming and will find its full expression in the vault at the end. The fight scenes on the other hand are first of all and above all sombre and dark, bleak and full of shadows, the shadows of our memory and of our inherited culture : we know that playing with such a fire is deadly, fatal and lethal, and the music is there to make that hellish fire of hatred burn anew and burn ablaze. But it is a ballet and The Royal Ballet of London makes a miracle with a gorgeous setting, with superb costumes, with delicate and light dancing, all the time. Naturally Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev are the stars, but stars in a sky very well staffed and packed with smaller stars, but stars all the same. And the gleaming light of the main stars is enhanced by the twinkling lights of the others. They do not dominate. They are carried to the top by the magic carpet of all the dancers that fly high and swift in the sky of the music. And this classical dancing is also enriched with the expressivity of every movement, of every bearing of the heads, of every look in the eyes, so much so that we do not even know where to start looking, watching, admiring and satiating our desire of beauty.

One of the other reviewers here either knows for a fact, or surmises, that this DVD was made from a video (presumably VHS) of the original film; and I strongly suspect that that is true; film itself having higher definition than what is seen here; so it is quite disappointing that no DVD (or Blu-ray) has been made that preserves the quality of the original. But this is A/V technology from 50 years ago (as I write this), so maybe we can only hope for so much. Regrettably, the sets weren't much better.

With those quibbles off my chest, let me go on to emphasize that this is one of the major artistic achievements of the twentieth century--by the composer, the performers, and even the choreographer. The consummate artistry of Nureyev and Fonteyn burned brightly through the haze of the primitive technology, and a case can be made that this is the greatest ballet score ever written (though I'm not knocking Swan Lake!). I had a mixed, but mostly positive, reaction to the choreography. For those scenes that did not involve Nureyev and Fonteyn I thought the choreography rather static, and sometimes just plain sissy. In this respect preferred the production by the Stuttgart Ballet that I saw back in the 70's. But in this Royal Ballet production when Nureyev and Fonteyn were together, the choreography seemed perfect for them and for the story. The collaboration of those two is justifiably legendary, artistry of this level making me wonder how it was even humanly possible.

I do wish that Criterion, or some other label with the resources to do the job right, would remaster the original film and provide a disc with better production values, and perhaps more meaningful bonus features; but even this bare-bones DVD does the essential thing: it brings us a pinnacle of western civilization standing magnificently on its own.",1465689600,3,1899,4.894409937888199
