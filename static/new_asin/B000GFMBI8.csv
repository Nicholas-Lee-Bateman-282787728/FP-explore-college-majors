8131370,3,B000GFMBI8,"It was very good and well done, but it just skimmed over the top of each problem.  I wish it would have gone into more detail.  I didn't feel that I had learned much more than I already knew.",1301875200,,191,3.871794871794872
8131371,5,B000GFMBI8,"On the back of the box, it is recommended by Jean Donaldson (""Culture Clash"") who says:  ""The content is aces...bull's eye accurate...completely friendly to the overwhelmed owner.""  If Jean likes it, it's hard to argue with that!",1216944000,,229,5.162162162162162
8131372,5,B000GFMBI8,"It was so helpful with our new puppy ...  Everything we were trying to figure out was in there ... the crate issues, chewing stuff, house training explained clearly, and wonderful tips throughout.  Plus, the trainer is always showing real world situations with real puppies.  Would recommend this for anyone who has or is thinking about getting a new puppy.  Nice graphics and music to boot.",1163289600,2,391,4.878787878787879

The production quality of this video is really superb, unlike some other pet videos. You can tell a lot of time & thought was put into making it. I would recommend it to anyone thinking about getting a dog, or who has recently got one - you will definately find useful ideas about training your dog.",1163289600,,415,4.265822784810126
8131374,5,B000GFMBI8,"This DVD is a great resource for any pet owner. While it is targeted towards puppies, I learned tips that would also be useful for older dogs. The DVD had great ideas for socializing my puppy with other pets and humans alike. The section on housetraining eased one of our primary concerns over adopting a new puppy. The DVD is engaging, entertaining and is fun for the whole family to watch. I highly recommend it.",1162684800,,414,4.533333333333333
8131375,5,B000GFMBI8,"I received this DVD as a gift to me and my new puppy.  It was so helpful and to-the-point. It covered a wide range of topics and answered so many of my questions.  I especially loved the part where she shows you how to teach the dog not to jump up on people as they come in your door.  Besides being helpful to me and my pup the DVD is a lot of fun to watch and funny too.  If you've got a new puppy ... you've got to get this DVD. It should go on every new pet owners list along with a dog bowl, collar and leash.",1162425600,4,514,3.688073394495413
