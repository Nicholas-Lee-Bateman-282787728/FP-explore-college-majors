7937842,3,B00005BJWQ,"The movie ""Babe"" is a big hit in our family, having rented it (VHS) several years ago.  The sequel, ""Babe - Pig in the City"" is very good, too.  We recently purchased a widescreen HDTV, and I was on the prowl for widescreen DVDs the entire family could watch and enjoy.  The ""Edition Details"" for ""Babe"" (the single) clearly state the movie is full-screen.  However, the details for this two disk set, ""Babe"" and ""Babe - Pig in the City"" led me to believe BOTH titles were widescreen.  They are not.  Only the latter, ""Babe - Pig in the City"" is widescreen.  Although I still love the movie, I am disappointed.",1009584000,19,610,4.441441441441442
