7989657,3,B000095J6F,"From a western vampire-film fan who does not know a great deal about Taoism or Chinese folklore, I would say that this film is funny and entertaining but not nearly as good as the first one.  The plot is interesting, the special effects are competent, there's a lot of neat ""Taoist magic"" moments, there's a few cool stunts, and the acting overall is good (considering this film is intended to be goofy); nevertheless, Mr. Vampire 3 just doesn't deliver as well as Mr Vampire 1.  My two biggest complaints are that the apprentices in this installment are not as likeable or as believable as the first film's duo, and the pacing isn't nearly as good.  This latter may not sound like a big problem, but in a film whose major appeal lies in suspense and humour, it really is.

In sum: if you liked the first film, you'll probably like this one too, but it feels very much like a sequel (if you know what I mean).",1169164800,,909,4.425149700598802
7989658,5,B000095J6F,"I really like the Mr. Vampire series. Volume 3 was much better than volume 2. In Volume 3, Mr. Vampire is confronted by a rogue priest (Uncle Ming) who uses the disembodied ghosts of his 2 nephews to bilk victims out of cash. When Mr. Vampire and Ming meet, Mr. Vampire's genuine personality and honorable nature  eventually wins the rogue over, and they become friends. Together, they team up to fight a group of supernatural mongols who raid the town seeking to rape, burn. and pillage. (Of course, what else?)
This was a great episode.  In particular I like the inclusion of the two ghosts.  They were 'good ghosts' who spent their time looking after their 'uncle.' I felt sorry for them, and hoped they might be so way to be resurrected Unfortunately not. Also, the villain's motivation was not quite clear. The Mongol's were led by an evil woman with a cat skull (?) inlaid tiara.  I never quite got, her relationship to the two men she tried so hard to rescue. Was one her boyfriend? Or her brothers? What? Even though she was evil, I felt impressed by her loyalty.
Things I could do without? The melted 'blob' ghosts. These were disgusting, and the accompanying repulsive 'squishy' sounds they make as they fought almost turned my stomach. Otherwise! Excellent. Well worth a viewing! A+++",1060214400,7,1295,4.716814159292035
