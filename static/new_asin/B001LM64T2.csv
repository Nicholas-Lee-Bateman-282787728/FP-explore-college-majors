3685635,4,B001LM64T2,A good source of entertainment for my kids. They like Alvin and the chipmunks since the movie came out. It doesn't play in the DVD automatically which is a feature I often appreciate from children DVDs so that it can replay automatically after it goes off.,1382659200,,256,4.586956521739131

3685638,5,B001LM64T2,"Our grandson loves the chipmunks and we can get a breather when he sits down to watch a DVD of theirs.  He is rapt throughout the program whereas he ordinarily only watches bits and pieces of other children's videos...except for ""UP""...I find that I enjoy the songs during the video even if I am not in the room with him...we don't ""plug"" him into videos all day long but it is nice to get a break from the chipmunks when we really need it!!!",1361577600,,442,4.261904761904762

A chipmunk as the Easter Bunny and he was the FIRST Easter bunny...how can this be???  Cute movie.",1331337600,2,140,4.833333333333333

(This review may contain spoilers)
My sister (10) and I (17) watch Alvin and the Chipmunks a lot, it has great nostalgia value for me and my sister is just mesmorised by the squeeky voices.

There are 5 episodes on the DVD which are: ""The Easter Chipmunk"" (Dave gets REALLY mad in this one) ""Snow Wrong""(Based on Brittany) ""Special kind of Champion""(Based on Alvin and a boy who is disabled) ""Thinking cap trap""(Based on Simon) and ""Luck O' The Chipmunks""(Based on an Irish boy who Theodore befriends)

The catchy music adds to the great story lines particuarlly in ""The Easter Chipmunk"" where Alvin is sure that the real easter bunny is infact his grampa... a chipmunk. The end to this episode is a surprising twist with a great few: AAALLLVVINN!! shouts from Dave! It's great to watch on Easter after stuffing your face full of chocolate as my sister and I found out.

The other episodes are great too; ""Special Kind of Chapion"" involes and boy who has a disabilty which means he has to wear a brace on his leg to help him walk. He is really into sports and doesn't mind loosing (which is completley the opposite to Alvin who is training him in order to pass his gym class). I really liked this episode because I myself have needed to wear braces on my legs to help me walk, and my younger sister has questioned this, and wondered why I didn't just have a wheel chair instead of struggling to learning to walk proporly. I think this episode shows that disabled people can do things able-bodied people can do very well and answered her question.

One thing that may annoy people is the girl in ""Snow Wrong"". Her dad is casting for the local play and she is furious when he picks Brittany over her, simply because Brittany and remember the lines and does have a voice like a cat being stranggled. Her voice is really annoying so you can really feel for Brittany when something bad happens to her...

All in all this is a great way to spend about 66 minutes of Easter, or any old time, not just for kids, but for teenagers and adults too! Great perchase!",1305331200,9,2084,4.473684210526316

3685642,3,B001LM64T2,"We LOVE Alvin and the Chipmunks in our house. But, this was not one of my favorites. It wasn't very much even about the Easter holiday itself. I was hoping for a more light hearted show as well, and this one is a little too serious for my kids to enjoy.",1275350400,,253,3.980392156862745
3685643,5,B001LM64T2,"I put this in my 3 year old son's easter basket and he was so excited to see it!  He watched it before we went to church.
Its a cute dvd with an easter bunny epsiode and one about snow white and one about a disabled child in a sporting event and Alvin coaches him.",1270425600,,264,3.8
3685644,4,B001LM64T2,"The Easter cartoon is not a very good example of the chipmunk cartoon as a whole.  I thought it was a little over the top what Alvin did in the cartoon.  It did end with a moral lesson though.  The episode is more of an Alvin scheme than an Easter story.  If you are wanting a stictly Easter story this one's not for you, but if you're a fan of the chipmunks it's a good one for you.  You also get some other episodes from the series on here that are fun to watch.",1252454400,4,464,3.893617021276596
