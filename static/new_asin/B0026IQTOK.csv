3853712,4,B0026IQTOK,"If you want to see Great White Sharks up close than this is the documentary for you. They're all over the place, including lots of other sharks. Focuses are on how sharks attack, what to do if you are attacked by a shark, real people who survived shark attacks and explorers going underwater and messing with sharks in all types of ways you couldn't imagine.

3853714,4,B0026IQTOK,"Awesome to watch blown on a projection system. The 1080 quality on these episodes are really incredible. Some scenes appeared to be in 3D even! Educational, but certainly of the kind where I can see it multiple times just for the enjoyment of it. Truly shows off your system as well.",1320969600,2,283,4.568627450980392

Ever see a Great White Shark in the flesh? Well, this Blu-ray will show them to you as never before and from the safety of a TV. Beautiful and majestic creatures, up close and in HD! A great collection of shows from Shark Week 2008.

BLU RAY THOUGHTS: This disc is gorgeous and does the sharks justice. Pristine picture and crisp audio. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE from the DVD!",1275436800,5,425,4.435897435897436

3853720,4,B0026IQTOK,"Every year the Discovery Channel does their ""Shark Week"" thing; a series of shark-themed shows. Now they've released a new collection of some of these shows that also acts as a great sampler for the network's programs (well, at least those that don't center around blue-collar jobs, like ""World's Deadliest Catch"").

You get episodes of ""Survivorman"", ""Mythbusters"" and ""Dirty Jobs"". So far I've only watched the ""Mythbusters"" and ""Dirty Jobs"" episodes.

The ""Mythbusters"" one is a 90 minute special and includes things like a mechanical shark and a robot dog with some interesting secretions...

For ""Dirty Jobs"" you get to watch Mike Rowe and friends as they head up north. Way up north. So far north that you can't go too much farther north without going south. They head out there in search of an elusive shark that may be eating seals.

You also get ""How Not to Become Shark Bait"" (lesson one, I'm guessing, don't work for the Discovery Channel), ""Mysteries of the Shark Coast"", and ""Day of the Shark"".

Bonus features include some ""Dirty Jobs"" stuff, as well as something called ""Summer of the Shark"".

Overall a good little package at quite a good price!",1247616000,22,1161,4.868020304568528

3853765,5,B0026IQTOK,"Perfect video for a young shark lover.  Not too scary or graphic (my 2 year old loves it), and we love the fact that it includes Dirty Jobs (including old DJ shark episodes!), MythBusters, and Survivorman.  We all love watching this.",1423267200,,233,4.658536585365853
3853766,5,B0026IQTOK,"I own several seasons of Shark Week, but ""The Great Bites"" collection is one of my favorites.  The picture and sound quality are impressive.  This season came out long before the bad comedy routines and misleading information about Megalodon.

Included on this Blue-ray are:
Surviving Sharks - Les Stroud shows you how to survive when surrounded by sharks.
How Not to Become Shark Bait - 3 guys actually ""want"" to get bitten, so they try everything you're ""not"" supposed to do.
Mysteries of the Shark Coast - scientists try to discover why sharks are disappearing from Northeastern Australia.
Mythbusters: Shark Special 2 - the team tests out shark myths to see what is true and what is not.
Day of the Shark - see what swimmers do wrong and get attacked.
Dirty Jobs:Greenland Shark Quest - Mike Rowe searches for a Greenland Shark in the frigid arctic north.

Bonuses include:
Shark Attack Files 4: Summer of the Sharks - Shark Attacks (graphic).
Dirty Jobs: Jobs That Bite - Mike Rowe creates shark chum and tries it out in the ocean.
Dirty Jobs: Jobs That Bite Harder - Mike Rowe creates shark replicas and a shark proof suits which he tests out in the Bahamas.",1420934400,,1164,4.6911764705882355

3853769,3,B0026IQTOK,"The DVD itself was great, my twins are really into sharks right now and loved to see all of the sharks swimming across the TV. HOWEVER! My DVD case was completely smashed and broken when it arrived. I'm amazed the dvd itself was still in good condition since it had nothing keeping it in place. I will be called Amazon to replace this. I'm sure most products don't arrive that way, so other than that I would recommend.----Mother of twins and Authorized Independent Tupperware Consultant http://www.my2.tupperware.com/alyseanderson",1405641600,,531,5.186046511627907

3853785,5,B0026IQTOK,Has a great Mythbusters episode and some documentaries.  The documentaries are interesting and seem fairly presented.  There seem to be some more sensational episodes too but definitely worth looking through.,1377734400,,208,5.9

8352663,2,B0026IQTOK,"I hate to leave a bad review, for I love sharks, documentaries, etc.  I only watched the first episode, for the filming style was that where they jerk the camera around, speed footage up, do abrupt cuts...  Are sharks not exciting enough, that you need to throw in a bunch of fancy camera techniques to try and maintain audience attention?

It may be a great show, but that filming style makes me almost nauseous to watch.",1439337600,2,422,4.526315789473684
