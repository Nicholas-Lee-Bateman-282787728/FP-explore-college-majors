6247839,1,B00I2YXN46,"This movie had a bad plot line, bad acting and was very predictable.  If your looking for a total no-brainer, then this is the movie for you.",1397347200,2,141,4.222222222222222
6247840,4,B00I2YXN46,"This is an odd story that keeps you guessing as to what is happening, although you have a pretty good idea, you are never really sure until the end. Chris (Christian Oliver) and Maggie (Rachel Marie Lewis) move to an isolated home from the city. She had just lost her 8 month fetus, although we are unsure of the circumstances. Chris likes to drink and appears to get abusive, although we never see the abuse, just the results. He claims he doesn't abuse her. Chris is a firefighter who leaves for three days at a time.

Maggie hears, feels, and sees things in the house that Chris seems to miss. She hears a phone ringing, although the house never had a phone line run to it. The Anderson couple live next door, although no one is supposed to be there. They mirror her situation. He is a fire fighter who is abusive too. Both her and Mrs. Anderson like to paint. So what exactly is going on?

There are clues being dropped all the time, but to what?

6247869,3,B00I2YXN46,Not the best horror movie but it had few good parts to it I thought. Ending had a surprising twist to it.  Kinda a creepy twist .

6247878,4,B00I2YXN46,This movie was great to watch in bed before falling asleep.  Some parts are scary. Took two nights to finish. Gives strong feeling of isolation in the woods. It is slow and plodding but that is the best part. Some parts are haunting and gives the impression of a movie from the 70s or early 80s. The plot is not much but the way it is filmed works on holding your attention.,1464220800,2,374,4.194444444444445

6247884,1,B00I2YXN46,"I love a good scary movie & always look forward to watching one. Unfortunately this movie was too convoluted and drawn out to deliver any suspense or plot surprises. I found little to connect me to the lead actors & really didn't form any attachment that made me hope for their deliverance from evil. They acted so blah & their actions weren't really believable. Perhaps it was the editing that was to blame for the parts that made little sense, but I didn't enjoy the movie much & there weren't any scenes I would consider chilling or even spine-tingling.",1463961600,,556,4.626262626262626

6247893,4,B00I2YXN46,"David Mun, director of HOUSE OF GOOD AND EVIL (2013), has a 15 year career as an assistant cameraman, mostly on TV series, and more recently as cinematographer for low budget feature films. To date (11/15) ""Good & Evil"" is his only directorial effort.

This is the story of a young couple who, after a miscarriage, try to save their deteriorating marriage. They buy an isolated house on 20 acres of thick mountain woodland. The nearest town is over 20 miles away, and with husband Chris Conley (Christian Oliver) gone for days at a time while he undergoes firefighter training, wife Maggie (Rachel Marie Lewis), who is psychologically very fragile, tries to carry on alone in their half of a large house currently divided into a duplex.

Maggie sees and hears things. Chris thinks she's got mental problems, that is, when he's sober enough for analytical thought.

Their next door neighbors, an older couple who are awfully hard to contact, should be moving at the end of the month, after which carpenters will take down the walls that divide the house. The question is: with all sorts of creepy things happening to Maggie, especially during the small hours and in her nightmares, will she still be sane enough to enjoy the transition?

Once Maggie finally meets and gets to know Mrs. Anderson (Marietta Marich), she learns how terrible life with husband Dale (Jordan Rhodes) has been for this battered woman.

IF you can relax and let events take time to unfold, there's a fine sinister atmosphere throughout this interesting little story, and a powerful anticipation builds that some horrible tragedy will soon occur.",1446508800,3,1619,4.915750915750916

6247895,1,B00I2YXN46,"This has got to be the most boring movie I have ever watched! It was sooooooooo SLOW! The female lead really annoyed me with her delayed , if ever, responses to simple questions. I was going to give the movie zero stars, but decided that some people may like it if they have very active imaginations and would prefer to make up the story as they go along. I agree with an earlier post about the old woman being good. The other actors... well...",1400976000,,444,4.2976190476190474
6247896,1,B00I2YXN46,"Shoot, I erased my original review.  I can't relive that; just as I can't relive this movie again.  I had to stop midway to check that I was watching this critically lauded movie.  The title, graphics and tagline are all misleading.  House of Abused Wife Who Goes Crazy.  Maybe that would more accurately describe this movie.  Don't waste your time on this.",1399248000,2,357,4.67741935483871

6247898,1,B00I2YXN46,"Outside of a really bad script, bad acting, poor directing, editing and filming the movie was a waste of time.
Husband and wife purchase a pretty average looking home that is a little secluded with no phone service or electricity. Husband is a firefighter so must have the money to do a bit better. Usual cheap scenes of wife sensing a bad house when she touches a wall (made no sense); doors closing on their own; strange sounds - all the usual scary movie hooks - except nothing really happens for the entire movie up until the final scenes where someone dies. Gee, how surprising! Even the dying seemed like a cheap Halloween store trick.",1398124800,2,641,4.582608695652174

On top of that, they were stupid enough to buy a house sight unseen, and even though the realtor mentioned they'd spent fifty hours on the phone, somehow he never mentioned three crucial things, no phones or cell reception, no power, and someone else is living there.  Then in the house with no phone and no cell reception the husband tells the wife his work called him.  Uh huh.  Not to mention he's a total jerk.  She's about as imbecilic as they come.  Freaked out one minute, simpering the next.  These two idiots had about as much brain power between them as a ten month old puppy.

8638474,2,B00I2YXN46,"I've seen worse but definitely have seen much better. This movie was creepy at times (which I liked) but totally stupid and unrealistic at other times. I mean who moves way out into the middle of nowhere and buys a house without knowing there is no phone service? And then leaves their wife there for days on end with no phone? (Oh, she did have a cell phone but to use it had to ride a bike a couple of miles into the woods to a certain spot to use it.)  It just felt weird and disconnected to me. And talk about a dysfunctional relationship! One minute arguing, the next making out like they are madly in love! WTH??

8638475,4,B00I2YXN46,"[Rounded up from 3-1/2 stars, Minor Spoilers] I'm quite surprised at all the negative reviews for this film when there are, oh, so many worse movies out there with much less imagination, much lower production values, and much more inferior acting.  Perhaps, it's because ""House of Good and Evil"" contained no blood-sucking vampires, gratuitous sex scenes, drug use, or grisly violence and asks too much of the short attention spans that technology has produced in us nowadays?  Whatever the case may be, contrary to those reviews, with your undivided attention, this film is quite an impressive, enticing, captivating little psychological thriller, indeed, that simply requires a little patience for the morsels of its storytelling, which I found quite appetizing, if you will.  After a young mother endures a miscarriage, she and her husband decide to start anew by trading city life for a rural (and quite isolated) homestead, expecting peace and tranquility, but one of them has absolutely no idea about the dire repercussions of their move and circumstances.  This film is fresh, unpredictable, and nowhere near average (in a good way) with just enough thrills and chills, all attributes in creating modest yet satisfying entertainment. [Viewer Warning:  Though sporadic, some scenes are still quite violent, with (unnecessary) strong language and sexual innuendo.]",1477008000,,1369,5.408450704225352
