I got 40 minutes into it and had no idea what it wanted to do or why...turned it off. Everything was BAD. Not even good, bad....just really bad.",1408233600,,279,4.185185185185185
8548504,4,B00A8TQIHM,"UPDATE ON MY ORIGINAL REVIEW.
\This was a nice surprise,actually being in WideScreen 2.35.1,and 16.9
Anamorphic.,though you have to open the film to 16.9
to unsqeeze it.

Brad Harris with a shirt on is quite novel,as he appeared in lots of
Sword & Sandal Films.

The film itself is an Italian Film,with a typical story.
Quite Good for its type.

 Full Moon should be thanked for releasing this rare film.

 Print Quality Quite Good. In Eastman Color & CinemaScope,despite what Amazon says.

Recommended.",1379462400,10,503,4.9879518072289155
