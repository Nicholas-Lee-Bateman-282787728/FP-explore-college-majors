5991834,5,B00FGVS0DM,"An important film with great information, especially how bad ideas are marketed to the 'silent majority' to sell what is essentially harmful:  fracking and its trail of environmental, climate and health damage.  Give it a listen and consider the impact. If global warming (now titled climate change as the former title didn't work well) is a concern, then why are 2.5-3.0 million fracking wells permitted globally?  All of them expel or permanently leak green house gases such as methane, well done Josh Fox!",1389830400,7,508,5.096385542168675

Its is long (2 Hours) but almost everryone stayed to watch it in its entirety plus we gave a presentation at the end that went on for another hour.

What really affected me was the two, ""twenty-something,"" upper class white women sitting next to me. Every time a Democratic politician was exposed as being ""on the take,"" they would look at each other with disbelief and concern. But, come the next election, they will probably pull the Democratic lever for a host of reasons: to keep ""the right to choose safe and legal;"" to keep ""their"" check coming, etc. etc. Since the Democratic Party knows that their own coalition (African Americans, Hispanics, and ""educated"" white women) ALWAYS give them a pass...NOTHING WILL BE DONE ABOUT FRACKING. Why do people complain about injustice when they are willing to look the other way, as long as they get THEIR ""piece of the pie,"" whatever that may be.

5991838,5,B00FGVS0DM,"I saw this film at a screening hosted by Clean Water for NC & Working Films' Reel Power and organized in conjunction with NCFrackFree, etc.
And it was moderated by banjo playin' Josh Fox himself.

I saw the film as tempered from the previous optics of flaming faucets and more attuned to the process of corporate infuence if not outright control of government.  The path is greased for the drillers.  And the wells are spreading like a pandemic.  The property, climate, and toxicity risks from fracking are real and happening.  We can live without gas but we can't live without affordable potable water.

The bottom line message is to organize and develop vocal mass citizen opposition before the need is apparent. Ultimately, politicians truly must heed majority demands of their voters to get/stay in office.

However, when the need to oppose fracking is obvious as mineral rights are bought and wells are drilled, the politicians are already in the pocket and the juggernaut is already unstoppable.

In the film we see the wells adjacent and startingly close to Josh's previously secluded home.",1382486400,45,1097,4.989010989010989
5991852,5,B00FGVS0DM,"Yes, Gasland II repeats itself somewhat.  That doesn't hurt for the people new to Mr. Fox's films.  And a powerful message sometimes bears repeating.

Some reviewers here talk of the ""positive"" benefits of fracking, complaining that they aren't covered well in Gasland II.  Those same reviewers are mostly strangely silent on what those ""benefits"" might be.  There's a reason why countries around the world are trying to ban fracking.  There seem to be almost no positive benefits to this carbon extraction.  Besides the obvious problem of poisoning wells, rivers and even aquifers, there are fracking quakes (including fracking over the faults in Los Angeles).  And methane burnoff (shown via special cameras, since it's normally invisible) that contributes tremendously to climate warming.  There are health problems like nose bleeds, rashes, lung damage, and blood contamination.  There would be a lot more health issues verified if they'd do the studies.  This is all besides the the damage done aesthetically to the neighborhoods these people built in, whether or not they personally opted for fracking.

To claim that people's water caught on fire BEFORE the fracking occurred is a lousy and inaccurate excuse for the personal agonies detailed in this film.  The film shows respectable engineers who have worked with well science testifying that the concrete surround of one of every twenty wells created cracks when first engaged, and therefore should begin to leak immediately.

The political corruption that accompanies the fracking debacle is repulsive and self-serving.  The manner in which the EPA was called to account by the so-called ""science committees"" of our legislature when its studies showed some real dirt on the fracking industry was also despicable.  And since apparently the states hold precedence over federal oversight with regard to fracking, all it takes is to buy out some state legislators.  Not to mention bribing them with the notorious ""revolving door.""

And the fracking companies have been caught on record discussing their use of former government Psy Ops employees to combat the ""insurgency"" of homeowners who challenge them.  Fox points out that it's illegal for Psy Ops to be used by anyone but the government.  But the final solution always is to pay the people off and shut them up.  Many of the abused homeowners who spoke out early in this film were silenced by nondisclosure agreements they acceded to in order to be able to move from houses that were no longer sellable.

One concerned legislator who was interviewed points out that the economic repercussions of cheaper fracking gas in the marketplace will likely drive up the price of  oil, and then the former will also increase in price so that we once again have no cheaper source of energy.

And a personal concern of mine, not mentioned in the documentary, is that fracking will ultimately encourage water privatization as a substitute for the water it pollutes, something that if recent history on similar privatization is accurate, bodes no good for citizens.

Mr. Fox, a personal witness and sufferer of fracking, has done a fine job of sharing his experience with us.",1467590400,,3174,5.15234375

5991856,3,B00FGVS0DM,"Gasland Part II is a documentary that was directed by Josh Fox and released on July 16, 2014 on HBO. People who were for fracking, against fracking or had no idea what fracking was were drawn to this documentary. Fracking is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rocks, boreholes, etc., so as to force open existing fissures and extract oil or gas. The film declares the gas industry's portrayal of natural gas as a clean and safe alternative to oil is a myth. How fracked wells leak over time contaminating water and air, hurting families, and the earth's climate with the greenhouse gas methane. Josh Fox narrates his reception of a letter in May, 2008, from a natural gas company offering to lease his family's land in Pennsylvania for $100,000 to drill for gas. He then spent time with citizens in their homes and on their land as they relayed their stories of natural gas drilling in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Texas. He spoke with residents who have experienced a variety of chronic health problems directly from the contamination of their air and their water wells or of surface water. The interviews make it very clear how horrible the living conditions are and how its hurting so many families. Towards the end of the film, Fox is arrested trying to film a congressional hearing regarding the E.P.A. results in Pavilion. Even after this, Fox still remains determined to finish his mission. Gasland Part II does a great job of putting in perspective how serious this fracking problem actually is.
 Throughout the film, a big strength is how Josh seeks out to real people who are affected by fracking to get their point of view. He interviews lots of families and they share with him how hard it is. For example, one of the guys lit his drinking water on fire to show how unsafe and dangerous living like that could be. The people interviewed really explain how badly fracking does affect them. Many people are unaware of this struggle, and this film really opens your mind and makes you think. Most of these people that are affected are connected to their property in multiple ways. Whether they built their house with their bare hands or their ancestors have lived there decades, they should not be forced to move. These consequences of fracking are extremely shocking and Mr. Fox does a good job of putting the viewer in the shoes of the residents.
  Although he always leaves out the positive effect, he constantly brings your attention to some of the terrible consequences. However, he could bring up the positive effects of fracking. The movie seems a bit depressing for the most part and it makes me feel bad for all these people because its not fair for them. The fracking industry is portrayed as the big bully that is attacking innocent people. When you watch this movie you have to be careful you do not fall for Mr Fox's manipulation. In the documentary, Mr. Fox appears as the innocent man who is just trying to find the truth. This is another aspect that easily allows the viewer to fall for the documentary tricks. Fracknation, another documentary about fracking points out many of Mr. Foxs flaws. It points out how many people were able to light their water on fire before fracking began near them. I highly recommend watching Fracknation after you have have watched Gasland Part II. It well help balance your view of fracking and allow you to really clearly tackle the topic.
 Gasland Part II was a very informative film and I do recommend taking the time to watch it. It is a very eye opening and powerful documentary, which is why it has gotten the attention of millions of people around the world. Although Fox focuses mainly on the negatives of fracking, he makes it known how horrible of a problem fracking really is around the world.",1462147200,,3794,4.717948717948718
5991857,4,B00FGVS0DM,A good documentary outlining the problems we face with unregulated fracking. It points out an important point that all this damage that is being done to our water and air from fracking doesn't even benefit our country with the natural gas.

He brought a challenging atmosphere between the ordinary people and the gas companies which successfully erupts into a big debates. The only problem about this movie is that it only focuses on the people's side. It never gave the audience the chance to hear the side of the gas companies and how would they address the problem. Other than that the movie is really great and helpful, however I would recommend to watch gasland part 1. And it will be helpful if you see what the opposite side has to see by watching""fracknation"". Both movie have opposite position, that will give you a balance view of the pros and cons.",1460505600,,718,4.661417322834645

Shortly after showing it, a nearby effort was made by a Chinese-led consortium to construct the largest chemical plant of its kind on the shoreline of our beloved Puget Sound. The majority of the members of our church were supportive of our effort to join the clamor of voices to stop the construction. I believe the lessons of the movie have had something to do with the fervor shown in our congregation.

5991896,3,B00FGVS0DM,"Gasland part 2 is a documentary that was directed by Josh Fox and released on July 16, 2014. In this documentary Josh Fox tries to convince the audience that fracking is not safe and gives the people who have allowed fracking on their property a chance to be heard. Although the movie Fracknation gives us a point of view that shows us the good side of fracking, Gasland part 2 gives us quite opposite. Josh Fox might argue that this film reveals the truths about fracking and how it is affecting our environment. Not only does Fox argue his points but he also includes the point of view from the people who are living there. These people tell us their story of how fracking has affected them once they gave the companies permission to drill on their property. Some believe and argue that fracking is the main reason why they are able to light their water on fire. Although citizens have a solution of making a pipe line that would supply them with clean water their proposal is constantly denied ,revised, or ignored. Overall the film is well developed and gives the audience a point of view that fracking companies would not want the viewers to see.
The film does well by showing the audience that it is the people versus the companies. Josh Fox does a nice job by going to the people homes and getting their point of view. He shows us how people have to struggle because they cannot get clean water. The film is set up as an argument in my opinion. I say this because it seemed as if the film had a main argument which was is the fracking industry safe or not. With all this in mind, another strengths of this film was that the argument is very clear. The audience can clearly identify that Fox is against the fracking industry and thinks that it should have been taken down as soon as it started. In fact, they try to convince the government to make regulations on fracking but they lead to  nothing but failure.
 Josh Fox wanted to inform people about the fracking industry. However Mike Hale makes a really good point in his review of Galsland part 2. Hale stated ""we can see who has bought ""Josh Fox"" as a search phrase: a gas industry trade group offering the ""Truth about Gasland"". I believe that Hale quoted something important because if Josh Fox really wanted us to know the truth about the fracking industry then why would his name be sold to a gas industry. The gas industry then has the benefit to tell people their point of view and make themselves sound as if they are doing good. Hale also states ""The film runs to two hours and its anecdotal, hopscotch style starts to wear."" Fox might argue that he needed that he had a lot to argue therefore  he needed to make the film longer. However i would agree with Hale. The movie is way to long and the point drags on too long. Fox could have wrapped the movie  up within an hour but instead he goes out and finds more people that arte against fracking and more reason why there should be regulations on fracking. Overall the movie makes a valid point but is a bit lengthy.
 The film has its strength but has one major weakness. The film's is more or less one sided. It only informs the audience of how fracking is hurting the people and their environment. Fox states ""there is no safe drilling"" and sticks to what he believes in. He should of at least interviewed one or two people that are for fracking because it would have made his argument stronger. Fox's argument would have been much stronger because  not everyone believes that fracking is bad. Maybe some positive thoughts about fracking could have attracted both audiences.(the people who believe that fracking is bad and the people that believe that fracking is benefiting us). Overall, the film is worth watching if you have the extra time. As stated previously the film is a bit lengthy and the point that is being made drags on and on. If you just want a quick jist of what fracking is then this movie is not for you. The movie is negatively charged and will not inform you of the positive outcomes of fracking.",1446508800,,4037,4.463414634146342
5991897,1,B00FGVS0DM,"Have you ever tried to light your tap water on fire?  Josh Fox, the controversial director of Gasland and Gasland 2 thinks you should try, especially if you live near a fracking site. Fracking or hydraulic fracturing is the process of extracting natural gas or oil by drilling deep into the earth crust and then injecting chemicals and water to fracture the shale rock and release the natural gas.  It is a complex, messy process, necessary for fueling the modern conveniences we cling to.  In this 2013 sequel to the ever popular Gasland, Josh Fox continues his muckraking of the fracking industry.  He would have you believe that the global phenomenon of fracking is killing people and contaminating water supplies with toxic drilling chemicals.  He surmises from interviews with locals that their water is undrinkable and is entirely due to the fracking that is going on, but is it really?  The EPA is saying there is no sign of widespread and systematic contamination of water supplies from hydraulic fracturing from a four year long report on hydraulic fracturing.  This report was released two years after Gasland 2, however Im sure this report would spin as just another evidence of the collusion between government and oil industry.  Just another case of the oil lobbyists influencing politicians to look the other way for the sake of prosperity, and most of all money.  Fox paints a picture of an America thats being pillaged and plundered by oil industry, and the people being collateral damage.

The destruction isn't limited to the water supply, Fox interviews a family from Texas whose being killed by the fracking around them.  In 2008 the family was starting to develop health issues. Their 11 year old daughter was getting nosebleeds and Fox wasn't above showing it.  The rest of the family was suffering from a laundry list of symptoms, everything from migraines, to high blood pressure, and nausea.  In 2014 the Parr family cashed in on their ailments, winning a civil suit against Aruba Petroleum who was the main player in the alleged pollution that was killing their family.  Aruba was resistant to settling with the family, because they adhered to all the EPA rules and regulations and there was absolutely no evidence to show for the Parrs claims.  Regardless, Aruba was still at fault.

Gasland 2 is a powerful documentary that pulls you in, and makes you want to join the cause.  It paints a vivid picture of an America that is being corrupted by the oil industry.  It does an excellent job of vilifying anyone involved with fracking from politicians who allow it, to the CEOs who are cashing in from it.  Fox instills a mindset in the audience of us vs. them, the greedy vs. the helpless, and you can't help but empathize with these people who are being mistreated.  Our government is turning a blind eye to these people, and letting them become collateral damage in this war for oil and profits.  It leaves you with a nagging question.  If this is so detrimental to our environment and our citizens, why is fracking still being allowed in our country?

For as many strengths that Gasland 2 has, it has far more weaknesses.  Steve Everly wrote a review of Gasland 2 for EnergyIndepth.com where he thoroughly debunks all of Foxs claims and evidence against fracking.  He argues that Fox uses lies and media hysteria to further propel his career, and I agree because theres very little factual evidence to back up Foxs claims.  Gasland 2 is a very biased documentary, and lacks any strong factual evidence.  The biggest claim Fox makes is that fracking is polluting water supplies, which has been disproven by the EPA and many other findings.  Fox makes claims that fracking is causing an increase in carbon emissions and pollution.  These claims couldn't be more false because carbon emissions in the USA are at the lowest theyve been in 30 years. The USA is leading the world in reduction of carbon emissions, despite the increase in fracking.

Gasland 2 is a very entertaining film, however it shouldnt be regarded as a documentary.  It lacks any real evidence for Foxs claims, most of the claims made have been disproven and debunked however he continues to make them.  He continues the same old tired story in this sequel, the same incorrect story thats been disproven time and time again.  If you're interested in the truth, then this is a film you should pass up.

Doesn't fracking kill trees and wildlife too? As it is, the devastation that was presented is overwhelming. It seems like fracking creates dead zones where everything near it dies and everything affected by groundwater contamination dies.

I also wish there were more in the movie that could give people hope that things are perhaps improving (not necessarily for those directly affected by fracking). For example, I just read somewhere that 65% of new electric power generation comes from renewables. That's encouraging. Perhaps Gasland movies are having a real impact reducing the rate of increase of new fracking sites. At any rate, I think talking about the positives would give it much broader appeal to people (including me).

The movie itself was very well done- with an excellent balance of scientific data to support it's view, and raw human emotion by all of those involved and hurt by this industry.

The fact that this monstrosity was born from a rather shocking request from an HBO official, is perhaps even more disturbing, apparently showing that such propaganda is swallowed so uncritically, without any reasonable level of awareness of the various counterpoints to this hollow condemnation of hydraulic fracturing (fracking!).  If you get this movie, make sure you follow up with Phelim McAleer's ""FrackNation"" and the film ""Truthland"" (a shorter but heartfelt and ethically-based response to Josh Fox's ridiculous claims by a person who actually lives on a farm in the ""affected"" region).

5992031,5,B00FGVS0DM,"I just watched the full video and HIGHLY recommend it -- particularly in Pennsylvania where we are being bombarded -- at least once a month -- by realtors, lawyers and other ""representatives"" of assorted frackers wanting ""rights"" in exchange for $$$$.  In a tight economy it is tough to resist such temptation, and more so with the barrage of ""offers"" flying to the mail box.  I think anyone with more than 5 acres of land is seeing this ""junk mail."" However, as what's left of any economy in this nation deteriorates, more people are going to say at least ""maybe"" to their offers.  It won't be perceived as ""junk mail"" when folks have dry bank accounts, and that's a major concern.  Once the deals are signed, it's difficult if not impossible to stop it.

Tis better to get organized ahead of the game, and in certain areas that is STILL possible.  Having this video's information is crucial.  I suggest watching it with a pen/paper handy.  Write down a few items for ""review"" with any who watch it with you.  Doing a home screening with a dozen neighbors, and following it up with a discussion (hitting again the high points) will help cement the information for everyone.  That makes it easier for them to talk to more people about it.  And ANY organized opposition creates  hesitation when someone is straddling the fence over an ""offer"" from the frackers.  People who have community ties do not want their neighbors mad at them, and it is pretty simple to show angst over destroyed water.

Activism-wise, bring the subject up at rural ""neighborhood watch"" meetings.  Maybe the ""crime"" in your area is more highly organized than the common druggies that eat up most crime-watch discussions.  Bring this subject up, and see how quickly attitudes change about what's worth defending. (You'll also see how fast people tuck in their chins if they have already succumbed to the pressure, or are thinking about it).

I gave it 5 stars because -- well, standing against this level of political-financial intrigue & corruption is just plain honorable.  As a production, how it was arranged, maybe some things could have been done somehow less ""man on the street"" and a touch more professional -- yeah, I get it. Probably not 5 stars using those criteria.  But what it lacks in polish, it does make up for in sheer guts.  Want to prove to me you have moral fiber?  Stand up to the big oil/gas industry. Then get political about it. Too many people are ""instant gratification"" for that today (hence, the problem outlined in the video).  Not many willing to engage knowing it's going to be a protracted battle -- years, maybe decades.  It's easier to take a ""buyout"" or ""payoff.""  So this documentary is worth the 5 stars in that arena all day long. Period.

We need more people doing these battles out front, and in public, and less people whining about ""creating jobs"" for more serfs on the plantation.  Some things are more valuable than money, and particularly a person's integrity.  Out here, we don't want a corporation providing us with bottled CITY water with fluoride.  We want OUR WELLS, and the natural minerals that water contains straight from the aquifer.  Bomb the aquifer, destroy the water, and then bring in a pipeline with CITY water to replace it?  You gotta be kidding!  That's not ""just compensation"" under any reasonable construction of the constitutional phrase.  Do what it takes to PREVENT this nonsense.  Local ordinances banning fracking would be step one.  If that fails, seek injunctions against drilling when you see the first truck  coming.  ""Just say NO"" -- simple enough.

""With thousands of cases of water contamination, air pollution, and health problems reported across the United States, it's not just the numbers that get you dizzy.  There was only one problem.  The gas industries denied everything.  The war for who was going to tell this story was on.""

The above comes from this revealing documentary, a sequel to the Oscar-nominated documentary ""Gasland"" (or what I call, ""Gasland 1"").  This sequel (I'll call it ""Gasland 2"") was again written and directed as well as narrated by Josh Fox.

Though not explicitly stated by Fox, Gasland 2 seems to be a reply to the critics of Gasland 1 since it goes more into depth and even presents new fascinating evidence of the dangers of hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" that's used by oil and gas industries.  As a result, it is longer than Gasland 1 by about twenty minutes.

Here is some of the things you will learn:

(1) There are many cases of groundwater and drinking water contamination around fracking sites.  (That is, the chemicals used in the fracking process end up on drinking water.)  The only option landowners have who are affected is to move especially for their children's health.

(2) A multiple award-winning professor of engineering at Cornell University explains how fracked waters can get into freshwater aquifers.  (Fox calls this professor the ""Godfather of Cement."")

(3) Even though fracking seems to be a deep underground activity, it's explained how fracking can cause noxious, dangerous, and climate-changing air pollution (that's right, air pollution!!).

(4) The numerous health problems of the people affected are explained.

(5) Surface water contamination due to fracking causes fish and animals to die.

(6) The numerous fracking sites causes destruction of land.

(7) Fracking causes sizeable earthquakes.  Places that have had no earthquakes in the past now have them.  Believe it or not, fracking is occurring on or near fault lines!!

(8) The gas industry hits back through smear campaigns, challenging people affected in the media, lawsuits, using psychological techniques (the same ones used in the army!!) against affected landowners fighting the gas industry, etc.

(9) Politics gets in the way such that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can't do its job.

(10) The land down under, Australia, is experiencing many of the same problems caused by fracking.  Australia is a very dry place and so every drop of fresh water is precious.

I can go on and on as to what you'll learn from this informative documentary but this review would become much too long.

The same interesting visuals as in Gasland 1 are presented.

According to the end credits, there were over 25 footage sources, over 100 people were interviewed, and 55 organizations were used and consulted for this documentary.
This documentary can be viewed after seeing Gasland 1 or as a stand-alone documentary.

Beware that there is a popular book called ""Groundswell"" and a popular documentary entitled ""Truthland"" that both endorse fracking and criticize Josh Fox.  The book's author was a former tobacco industry lobbyist and the documentary was funded by the gas industry.  Need I say more?

Finally, this DVD (the one released in 2014) has four extras.  All of them are interesting.

In conclusion, this is an informative as well as frightening documentary.  I leave you with this excerpt from a book made for young children that endorses fracking:

""Hello, my name is Talisman Terry, your friendly Fracosarous.  I am here to teach you about a clean energy source called Natural Gas.""

You'll learn that under the current administration that the federal government, the EPA and most members of congress and the senate have sold out to multimillion dollar corporations (in particular the oil and gas industry).  You will witness lie after lie from elected officials at local, state and federal levels.

You will meet homeowners, people just like yourself that have been bought off and silenced by big business  - they had no choice, as they could no longer drink their water, and/or their children, their animals or they themselves were sick.  You will see homes uninhabitable as a result of fracking - excuse me - as result of irresponsible and unsafe methods used by huge corporations to extract (i.e. fracking) gas from American soil.

You will be heartbroken hearing the story of what is happening to wildlife once a staple of the Wyoming landscape.  You will watch in horror as everyday tax paying citizens light their water wells on fire.

You will witness elected officials including the President lie to the American people.  And before it's all over, you will witness your civil rights and those of your neighbors being stripped away by government corruption.

You will learn the same company used to ""sell the people"" on how safe fracking is also once told the American public how safe cigarette smoking was!

You MAY get a sense that we have the potential to destroy the water supply and eventually planet Earth.  All in the name of gas and profit for the elite.  You will not see anything that is being done to lead the country (and the world) away from fossil fuels and instead towards methods of power from water, wind and the sun --- as promised to the American people by the current President.

Is this a political film?  No.  It's a film about the horrific dangers of fracking and the consequences we WILL FACE. As in ""we the people"".  You may ask if this isn't political, then why is this review and this film speaking out against the government?  Because the government is supposed to be ""of the people, by the people, for the people"".  You will learn, it's none of those.

Don't take my word for it - see the film! Tell your friends, family and neighbors to see it.  Tell them to teach their children.  Become educated yourself!

Can fracking be done safely and if errors occur will the companies engaged and supposedly regulated by the EPA be held accountable?  The stories in Gasland 2 indicate in many instances it is unsafe, and the EPA did not hold the companies responsible.  The film begs the question of just who is regulating the industry, if not the EPA?

The pressurized and toxic fracking fluids migrate upwards through these concrete cracks.  It only takes one who has worked with concrete as a tradesperson, or one who observes concrete cracks on roads and bridges to realize that concrete isn't perfect.  The director Fox interviews an expert Cornell University professor on this very point.  Because of the flawed design of the drilling sites, combined with hydraulic pressure (which wasn't used in conventional, older gas wells), more than half the wells will leak vast volumes of carcinogens.  Of course a sizeable percentage of the concrete casings will leak in a few decades, long after the cash from the methane sales will be made and distributed to shareholders.

The EPA has been banned from releasing any of it's horrific  findings to the public. We are heading into the worst drought period on record and at the same time depleting our last remaining fresh water and destroying all the our ground water. Where exactly do we think we will get water when this is done. You can't even use the polluted water to take a bath or water plants. Also since plants take in the chemicals in the ground we will soon lose the ability to grow safe food. So we won't have clean water, clean air or non poisonous food but we will have a non-sustainable way to power our SUV's. But wait a minute. After they completely destroy our country we will at the very least be getting the fuel right! WRONG!!

5992154,5,B00FGVS0DM,"I covered Fracking in a Physical Geology course and had the students provide a long list of benefits and detriments to fracking and suggest solutions. Such a list is no easy thing to compile given the disinformation provided by extreme points of view, which are the ""frack everything"" or ""frack-baby-frack"" side and the ""no-fracking-way"" side. Fracking provides a solution to an energy need but for how long and, more importantly, how safe. It's easy to become polarized on the issue. On one side fracking offers an abundant energy resource that could free the U.S. and other nations from foreign hydrocarbon dependence while creating jobs, wealth, and economic stability, and quite likely leading to ""world peace"" or at least a more peaceful world. On the other side, the potential damage to the primary water resource of the nation (groundwater), toxic air pollution, damage to the environment, rapid influx of greenhouse gases, and general disregard for homeowner rights, might lead to something akin to ""world destruction"". Gasland Part II outlines that side of the story in a jaw-dropping fashion. Undoubtedly, there is a way to use fracking for the benefit of the nation but with all the greed and corruption, outlined in scary detail in the movie, an environment that is destroyed by fracking while merely gaining a short-term energy solution that in the end provides great wealth only to a few is a more likely outcome. I highly recommend the movie.",1397779200,3,1457,5.075
5992155,5,B00FGVS0DM,"Highly educational, even more gripping than the first installment- fantastic explanation this time around of what fracking actually is for the viewer who isn't in the know.  Activism like this is just what we need more of in our American lives- hopefully it inspires and educates more than just it's already environmentally conscious targets.",1396828800,3,342,5.333333333333333
5992156,4,B00FGVS0DM,"Everyone should see this documentary and the first one, just to see the enviromental impacts of unchecked Fracking in rural areas. Yes, natural gas will help out the local economy and what not, but we are going to pay a irreversible price when a considerable amount of water is contaminated with harmful fracking chemicals. Also this documentary highlights the perversion of our government caused by these drilling companies that use money to quiet down people that have bad drinking water, smear campaigns, mass disinformation. Just watch it to see what I am talking about.",1396742400,3,574,5.117021276595745

Great movie! It should move people to work for change!",1394236800,3,343,5.125

GASLAND II is not. It's boring, slightly redundant, long, and did I say boring? You wait for it to twist or leap or shock You at some point, and that point just never materializes.

5992178,5,B00FGVS0DM,I was very pleased with Gasland Part 2 after seeing Gasland 1. This documentary explains in down to earth common sense terms of why hydro-fracturing deep gas wells and injection disposal has a very good chance of destroying water tables and causing damaging methane gas intrusion. By exposing this information which is actually common knowledge by the oil&gas industries we can value the need to proceed with caution in developing this resource and to continue to seek alternative forms of renewable energy. Hopefully to phase fossil fuels out.,1391558400,9,544,5.193181818181818
5992179,5,B00FGVS0DM,This is a must see for those struggling with the contamination and exploitation and also anyone who still has not seen the devastation first hand or heard fro family or friends in the middle of gas drilling. The benzene alone is carcinogenic. We were so glad to see Lisa Jackson who really tried to help. We are in a crisis of civil rights in the United States. Please get involved and save what is left.,1391126400,5,404,4.4
5992180,5,B00FGVS0DM,"I don't think we realize or want to let in the fact that the United States as a discrete nation no longer exists. Therefore the lives of individual persons and families, once regarded as ""Americans"" also no longer exist as entities comprising such a country. That kind of former nationalistic identity has given way to a global market where natural resources as well as people are regarded as commodities whose value is determined by the monetary rate or profit currently attached to them. Energy corporations have determined that the market value of natural gas will rise in this country as the demand increases and will increase exponentially in other markets such as Europe and Asia where energy prices are already many times that of the US. Anything or any persons who may get in the way of that process are mere impediments to be removed by any available means, be it sickness and death, immanent domain of their property, or being driven out of the way. We saw this happening in China and criticized their government as ""communistic"", ""totalitarian"", ""inhuman"", etc. while touting our ""freedom"" and self-determination. Thanks to Josh Fox for exposing the fact that individuals and individual lives matter little in the context of enormous power and financial resources.",1390003200,11,1275,5.04739336492891

The water tap lit on fire, was proven to be a hoax, and for anyone that has worked in oil, this movie is a tragedy.  Having family that has wellheads on our property, and knowing many farming communities that depend on fracking.  My suggestion do your own research.  Shame.",1481241600,,426,4.341772151898734
8615663,5,B00FGVS0DM,"In the 3 years since Gasland was released, the situation has only become more dire and much worse. Josh Fox's final comments at the end of this documentary are prophetic. Government in our country (as witnessed by Citizens United) is no longer by the people and for the people. We're being run by Corporations with more money than any city, county, or state can hope to ever see and utilize to protect themselves. Witness Dimock, PA where all the citizens were finally bought off and silenced -- their voices no longer can contribute to the groundswell of voices denouncing fracking. Corporations stopped and silenced the EPA, for heavens sake! The very agency created to protect our air, our drinking water, and the safety of our public utilities. We're screwed. I had hoped with the release of Gasland in 2010 that the people would rise up and fight back and that with the evidence that fracking was unsafe, something would be done. Instead, natural gas drilling has only increased and the dangers to our drinking water was increased as well. I'm sure the Gas Companies are already investing in water companies in some poor 3rd world nations to satisfy the thirst of the American public when all of our drinking water has been contaminated due to their negligence and greed.

Now with this new administration ready to take office, I see the situation getting 100,000 times worse, if that's even possible. Hold onto your hats, ladies and gentlemen. If you thought the Obama administration wreaked havoc on the EPA and public safety, wait and see what this next administration has up its sleeves. We are well and truly screwed.

Thank you, Josh Fox, for attempting to illuminate a subject that will affect each and every one of us living in the U.S. of A. Unfortunately, we're too stupid a nation to take heed. And even if we could, our safety has been bought, paid, and sold to greedy Corporate overlords who don't give a crap about anything but a green dollar.",1480723200,3,1962,4.767647058823529
