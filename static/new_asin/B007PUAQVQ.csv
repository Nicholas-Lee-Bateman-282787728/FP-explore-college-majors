8520694,5,B007PUAQVQ,"Excellent video. Not the same old golf information, more advanced concept of swing. I would recommend for the more advanced golfer. Not for the beginner.",1413849600,,153,5.16
8520695,2,B007PUAQVQ,"I buy too many golf CDs and books, I enjoy the game so why not.  I was excited when I saw Mr. Foley's CD because he is supposed to be (and I'm sure he is) the latest and greatest.  However, I would not recommend this CD to any stage golfer and here is why.  For the beginning golfer looking for instruction, there is simply not enough here for you, not even close. For the guy that coaches Tiger Woods and other professionals, I would hope to see in depth instruction. Lengthy segments on the mechanics of the swing.  The type of in depth analysis you get from Gary Player's or Martin Chuck's CDs (both of which I own).  In the Foley single CD you get about a 2 to 3 minute clip on drills and or some shots.  Very disappointing. On most other golf CD, it is a collection of CDs not just one.  That is your first clue there is not enough here.

For the middle to advanced golfer, there is nothing here that you have not seen or that you do not know.  And even if there was, 2 to 3 minutes of instruction is not helpful.  Mr. Foley has so much more knowledge and so much more to offer, clearly, then these little snippets of information. I hope he will put out another ""set of CDs"" one day which truly goes into detail on his vast knowledge base.

Thus, if you are looking for a golf series to buy, I would not invest your money here because you will not get enough information to help you, you will be frustrated.  The others that I mentioned herein (offered by Golf Revolution of which I have no ties or financial interest) will give you significantly more in depth analysis and information.  One other small yet important note is that the CD is not shot in HD, which makes it not as pleasant to watch.  Not trying to bash the CD or anything, but who doesn't shoot a commercial CD in HD.  It's a real head scratcher.",1389484800,4,1816,4.193083573487032
8520696,5,B007PUAQVQ,"This disk coupled with my instructors eye changed my gave in 6 weeks!
A must for anyone looking to move to the 'new swing'",1388361600,,122,4.125
8520697,5,B007PUAQVQ,"Very good DVD, and helpful with regard to the golf swing.  The DVD was not as comprehensive as some other DVD's I have viewed, but did offer some good insight.",1387843200,,159,4.3
8520698,5,B007PUAQVQ,Comprehensive and highly recommended. From setup to the follow through with drills for every aspect. Something for everyone regardless of handicap.,1387065600,,147,6.0476190476190474
8520699,5,B007PUAQVQ,"Sean Foley leaves you with no questions. I recommend this DVD to everyone. I started golfing 4 years ago and stopped in my third do to frustration. Convinced to try again by friends and family I got lessons and they helped a little. I then had one of the worst golfing experiences ever. I was so upset that I researched the best golf instructors and found the next generation DVD. Wow, I went from high 100 to high 80 in half a season. But you have to put in the work. Sean gives you great drills and his swing ideology leaves your head clear without any questions during your swing. If you want to enjoy golf with friends and family the GET THIS DVD ! Sean also has great tip on golf digest . com I also recommend combining david leadbetters DVD (from beginner to winner) which you can also find on amazon",1383523200,2,806,4.2745098039215685
8520700,5,B007PUAQVQ,Great DVD. Well layed out and simple to follow. Very technical compared to Hank Haney's DVD. We'll worth a look.,1379808000,,112,4.65
8520701,5,B007PUAQVQ,"Sean Foley breaks the golf swing down into parts and demonstrates how each part should look. Each section has some exercises/training/practice methods to obtain that beautiful new swing, so you can work on one piece at a time. Really easy, but you will need to put in the effort. Excellent DVD combo set and worth every penny if, like me, you don't have a swing that looks like a pro's but would like to have one that does!",1374624000,,423,4.435897435897436
