So, what it is, is a basic workout of stretching, pushups etc followed by a few minutes of punching and then kicking. It uses various ""kung fu"" stances to do these things and the punches uses fists common to ""tiger claw"" so it has a bit of that favor, but it is not particularly different from any workout you might already do. You will not learn anything particularly unique to the ""tiger claw"" style, so you do not particularly need it unless you what to see how a ""tiger claw"" practitioner generally trains and, so, may want it to see what exercises are focused to develop the strength needs for the style.

However, I do believe any general strengthen training is just as good since nothing particularly jumped out at me to make the workout unique - other than an exercise which was basically a variation on a burpee, so just add some burpees or similar exercises to your routine and do your pushups on your fists and when you can on your fingers and you are set.

It is a ""basic workout"", so it  is what it says, so it deserves three stars but not more.",1510099200,,1213,4.454954954954955
