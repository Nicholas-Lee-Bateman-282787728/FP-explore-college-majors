8515485,5,B007EY52H6,So good.  Saw her on TV  and then she was gone.  So glad they released the DVD.  Now I can make all the things I missed the first time around.,1507161600,,142,3.6333333333333333
8515486,3,B007EY52H6,"I really enjoy the dvd's. I was displeased with the packaging. The plastic connecting the cover to stay closed was broken when I took it out of the plastic covering and so was one of the joints on the back that hold the disk in place.
I like to keep them in their cases, but these keep falling out.

Remember sometimes it is the little things that keep a consumer coming back.",1367280000,4,376,4.222222222222222
8515487,5,B007EY52H6,"I kept looking for ""She's Crafty"" on Amazon for months, but never found the DVDs. As soon as I finally saw them, I snapped them up. Wendy is a total riot, and she really makes the crafts look easy. I love the banter and clever scripts. Who knew you could make a knife holder out of bamboo sticks? Or a birdhouse out of a book? (Although she likes tearing up books a little too much!) The guests make the episodes even better. The only bad thing is that you're left wanting more. 24 episodes aren't enough to enjoy Wendy.",1341360000,9,520,4.262626262626263
