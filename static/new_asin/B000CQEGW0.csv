How often have you heard this the book was better.? Well it is.
However, do not let this detour you from watching the movie.

At first I wondered how Dave Barry talked John Cleaves into being part of this movie; then I realized that they were kindred spirits.

Make sure your girl does not know about this movie or you may have some explaining to do.

Speaking about that, did she say something about a horse?",1494201600,,640,4.398305084745763
8100311,3,B000CQEGW0,"I tried, really tried to finish watching this movie, but the acting is painfully bad.  It's as if Dave just called up a few of his friends and relatives one weekend and said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie!""  I love everything Dave Barry writes, but movies are not his medium.",1454371200,,270,4.38
8100312,2,B000CQEGW0,"It's funny at times, but not as good as reading Dave Barry's writing. My roommate and I felt that we have experienced a lot of the typical ""guy"" behaviors.",1437004800,,155,4.379310344827586
8100313,2,B000CQEGW0,"I think Dave Barry's writing is akin to stand-up comedy. His flow, pacing, ""delivery"", and choice of material fits with the concept of a comedian on stage, giving a show with nothing but a microphone. His books are almost all based on the idea of picking a topic, then making lists of sub-topics, and cracking jokes about them. So to translate this into movie form required that the material be augmented and sometimes significantly changed. The writer of the movie had two choices I think. He could have turned it into a kind of sketch-comedy show, with a series of sketches but no attempt to connect them. The second choice, which he took, was to try to architect a flow more akin to a tradition scripted comedic story. I just don't think it worked. Maybe if it had a screenwriter with talent equal to Dave, it could have worked.

So basically, some of it was funny, but more often it was just dumb, and the ""flow"" was awkward. I say, read his book, and skip this movie.",1214870400,2,972,4.491525423728813

Note that this 2005 version (Amazon's release date for this is wrong, I think) of the DVD with the pink cover that includes a picture of Dave Barry has several special features that were cut out of the newer 2006 version that has the blue cover not including Dave Barry's face.  That blue-cover version, along with having more professional-looking DVD menus, may have better picture quality during the film, though -- at least it's easier to read the end credits on that version (and if they re-rendered the movie at higher quality and it took more space, that could explain why many special features were removed).",1164326400,2,682,4.722689075630252
