1623669,1,B00005LQ01,"Someone please tell me why they made this movie.  I saw it only becasue I thought it had John Wayne in it.  Its just a bunch of people running around acting like they own the place.  Do they own it?  They never said that they did or didn't.  My guess is that they do, i meant why would they do all this if they didn't. Who owns what what do I am what am I talking about who am I.",972518400,,379,3.6875
1623670,1,B00005LQ01,with the right actor for this film like a Jamie Foxx this would have been a breakthrough film for him.but the film trys to many cliched themes done many times before.it has it's moments. Jermaine Hopkins has skills.but the  sidekick was wack.i liked the Bikini Contest.but overall a Black Version of  Spring Break 2 or 3.nothing special.a few good things but overall  forgotten.,950918400,,378,4.968253968253968
1623671,1,B00005LQ01,"While ""Phat Beach"" has a good premise, it ultimatley goes nowhere. Throughout the film I kept waiting for it to get interesting soon, but it never did. None of the inexperienced actors have the charm ability  to carry the movie by themselves. ""Phat Beach"" may have been more  enjoyable if someone like Martin Lawrence or Chris Tucker starred in it  instead of these inexperienced comedians. Plus, the script is extemely slow  and unfunny. Some jokes had the potential to be funny, but weren't executed  right, due to the director's lack of skill. I only laughed twice at the  most during the whole film. By the way, the advertisements show Coolio on  the cover as if he was a main character , but he actually is only in the  film for about 2 minutes.",932428800,,750,4.586466165413534

1623676,3,B00005LQ01,"""Phat Beach"" is not a great movie....it'll never be on my list of all time favorite films, but it's also not a truly awful, awful one, either i guess; it depends on how you choose to approach it. It's one of those 90's teen comedies that you watch on a boring Friday or Saturday night when you're channel surfing, and you sit and have a laugh for an hour and a half, then keep it moving.

Jermaine ""Huggy"" Hopkins stars as Benny, a rotund but well meaning teenager who dreams of being a writer and entering a poetry class. Brian Hooks plays Durrell, his scheming, sex crazed best friend. Durrell has an idea to sell cheap sunglasses at the beach and borrow Benny's father's cherished Mercedes convertible; Benny reluctantly goes along with him. The rest of the movie deals with their misadventures as soon as they both arrive at the beach: chasing the sexy bikini clad chicks (and there are many!), Durrell's dumb rivalry with a goofy white wannabe homeboy named Mikey Z, and then a volleyball tournament!

Like I said, don't expect a very well made movie; at times, it looks so amateurish, the pacing is way off, most of the direction is a bit sloppy, most of the supporting ""actors"" look like they're posing in front of the camera instead of trying to create somewhat believable performances, etc. Yet theres some good chemistry between Hopkins and Hooks, and at times, Hooks almost pretty much steals the movie with his fast talking, manic portrayal of Durrell. Hopkins is likeable as the put upon Benny. However, the real attraction of the film is the large percentage of hot, sexy women in the film, especially Claudia Kaseem as Benny's dream girl, and Devin DeRay who has a cameo as a stripper....Mmmmmm!!! In any case, I like the occasional dumb movie too, as long as there's some entertainment value in it and ""Phat Beach"" qualifies, a bit. If you don't take it too seriously and can enjoy it for what it is, you'll like it.",1397779200,2,1932,4.629737609329446

1623680,4,B00005LQ01,"I remember watching this movie recently. I had avoided watching this movie for a long time due to negative reviews but I finally caved in and saw it. As I was watching it, I found myself laughing as the movie went along. Phat Beach doesnt take itself serious so why should you?

Phat Beach is a coming of age story about a plump kid named Benny(Jermaine Hopkins) who is unsatisfied with his summer and reluctantly joins his boisterous friend Durrel on a trip to the beach. Benny borrows his father's car for the trip and the rest of the movie deals with their misadventures at the beach.

Jermaine Hopkins is immensely likable as Benny. He comes of misguided at times but has a heart. Bryan Hooks is hilarious as the mischievous Durell. Granted that there are time when I didn't laugh but I laughed at 85% of this movie. That's way more then I ever laughed at any of the so-called comedies that are out these days(including anything by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg). I find these critics amusing. All this talk about quality films while they're religiously watching Quentin Tarantino's(overrated one-trick pony hack)crappy overrated films. Pulleeze! Oh yeah, the amateur critic reviewer thinks that Leonard Part 6 is a great movie. Nuff said.

At any rate Phat Beach is an underrated funny treat for people who don't pretend to be high-brow movie critics and can enjoy a movie for what it is. If you can do that you might like this one.",1242691200,,1441,4.687747035573122
1623681,5,B00005LQ01,"My family and I have been looking for this dvd for years. It is an all time favorite and very funny. I am very pleased with Amazon to have had this movie. In my opinion, Amazon is the best site to shop because I have always found 100% of everything that I want, and in mint condition. I am a frequent Amazon shopper and I have never had a problem with anything, nor have I ever waited long to receive my product. Thank you Amazon",1204761600,,429,4.0588235294117645

1623683,5,B00005LQ01,"phat beach is a coming of age story that will enlighten 6 and 60 year old's alike. this was most defently the movie that defined the 90's Brian Hooks was undoubtaly snubbed by the oscar commitie for best supporting actor and coolieo was brilliant, we already knew he was the worlds greatist rapper but to be such a suppieror actor its almost unfair for one man to posses that much tallent. if you never watch phat beach then you would be doing yourself a grave injustice. the acting and writing of this film rival such classics as citizen cane and gremlins.",1078358400,5,557,4.524752475247524
1623684,1,B00005LQ01,"I really, really wanted to like Phat Beach. The premise of an African-American beach movie had a lot of promise. What could have been an original, unique and entertaining movie was done in by a lack of effort. I was expecting a campy hip-hop version of ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" but instead wound up watching an awful unfunny film that didn't know what it was about. Was it a beach movie or a ghetto comedy? I really don't care. I want the 90 minutes of my life back that his film stole.
Phat Beach had its potential undermined by poor production values, horrible acting, and a script that seemed t be written by a chimp. The plot of the movie went in more directions than an ADD kid. I couldn't like any of the characters because I never got know any of them. It seemed everyone in this movie had a personality that was as deep as a Dixie cup. I'm still figuring out who is the main character, Benny or Terrell? Why do they want to go to the beach? Supposedly to sell sunglasses, but they never do that. Then there's a volleyball contest, he runs into his parents wins the contest and gets the girl. The End. However, that's the same as the beginning, a really bad rap video that features none of the actors in the film. And I'm still figuring out why the white guy was Terrell's rival and not Benny's.
Don't get me wrong I really like bad movies, the cheesier the better. The cheesily Krafted flicks made by the defunct Cannon Group and the late Samuel Z. Arkoff (American Ninja, Ninja III, Dixie Dynamite, Bleach Blanket Bingo and How to stuff a Wild Bikini) try hard to entertain and overcome their poor production values with a great script, strong effort by the actors and the director. The enthusiasm and energy you feel from everyone in the film makes you overlook the obstacle of a low budget and like the film. However Phat Beach feels so [poorly made] that I felt like I was watching somebody's home videos. The lethargic performances of the actors are so bad that it reminds me of a high school play. It seems no one tried to make this film work. It's a shame too, because this could have been a great film if the production team had a good script and the actors camped it up. All I can say is: Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't borrow it from the library. Don't even watch it on TV. You will wish you cleaned the gutters for 90 minutes rather than watch this film.",1052265600,3,2374,4.349099099099099

7944534,5,B00005LQ01,"Probably one of my all time favorite comedy films. Silly, feel good and great quality. Jermaine Hopkins stars as Benny-the overweight low self-esteem lover who daydreams all day about his dream girl played by Claudia Kaleem who actually shows up in reality while hanging on the beach with his crazy comical sidekick friend, Darell played by Brian Hooks.
