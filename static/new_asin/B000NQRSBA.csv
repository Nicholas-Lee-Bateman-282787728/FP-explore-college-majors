2778564,5,B000NQRSBA,"I consider myself a pretty fit person and have been working out for 25+ yrs, and I was very happy with this DVD.  The moves can be as challenging as the amount of weight or form you chose.  The trainer clearly explains various levels to accomodate beginners thru advanced and each of these is performed by people in the group she is leading, which is very helpful.  It utilizes basic moves so its easy to follow but the pace is fast and the music is fun.  I really enjoy Jeanette's style too - not sappy sweet like some trainers - fun, peppy and no-nonsense.  Its the total package of cardio and toning all in one!",1199923200,5,614,4.304347826086956
2778565,4,B000NQRSBA,"I bought this workout recently and did both workouts on consecutive days.  Jeanette is a very bubbly instructor and I enjoy her personality.  Workout 1 (Circuit A) is 38 minutes long and Workout 2 (Circuit B) is 36 minutes.  Each circuit covers different body parts (except the abs, which are worked in both circuits).  Both have virtually the same warmup and cooldown (but the outfits are different in each, so they are slightly different).  If you combine both of the workouts and skip the 1st cooldown and 2nd warmup, the workout probably comes in at around 60 minutes total.

All you need for this one is a mat and a couple of sets of dumbbells...I really enjoy strength workouts that don't require lots of equipment, and this one fit the bill.

Jeanette describes this as a circuit (strength + cardio) workout but the cardio bursts are neither long nor overtly intense so I don't consider this a circuit workout myself.  The cardio bursts work the abs pretty good, though and they keep the heartrate up.

All body parts are covered.  I wasn't really happy about the upright rows in Circuit B, as they work the shoulders (which I did the day before in Circuit A) so I did hammer curls instead (because the bicep work is light in this workout).  Other than that, I stuck to Jeanette's format.  I appreciated the rotator cuff exercise, as a lot of instructors skip that.

The music was pretty good instrumental stuff with a nice loud beat and I recognized a couple of songs.

My main issue with this workout is the counting.  Jeanette has the beginners do 15 reps of the strength work and everyone else do 25 reps.  Unfortunately, the girl cannot count accurately!  I frequently found myself above or below the 25 reps stated (once I found myself at rep 42)!  This doesn't bother me if both sides of the body are being worked at the same time (ie - squats) but it bugs the Heck out of me when I'm doing 1 leg at a time (static lunges, 1 legged squats).  So if you're a stickler about even counting on both sides, be sure to count the reps during the 1 legged exercises or you will be uneven.

It would have been nice if Jeanette had had someone off screen counting for her to insure that each side was worked evenly!

Good workout in spite of the uneven counting and I will be keeping it.  I liked this one Much better than Jeanette's 1st Hollywood Trainer series.

Recommend to intermediates, but advanced and beginners can use this one as well (just modify to your level).",1197936000,56,2476,4.514606741573034
2778566,2,B000NQRSBA,"After reading the great reviews on Amazon, I bought this DVD along with Jeanette's kickboxing DVD.  I have not tried the kickboxing yet, but I threw in the 21 day circuit and cannot believe how disappointed I was!  It is faced pace, which is nice, but the moves are very rudimentary and I barely sweat, although my heart rate did get up some.  Jeanette also walks you through the moves very slowly.  I have not tried the second workout yet, I will really have to work on getting motivated to do so, but I have no inclination to do the first half again, so it already seems like a wasted purchase.  As an ""advanced"" exerciser, I am all for tried and true squats and lunges and the like, but I just did not feel much at all during or after this workout. I get a better workout from just 15 minutes of Tami Webb's ""I want that body"". Jeanette encourages you to add weights to challenge yourself, but you can only go so heavy with the amount of reps that you have to do.  It may be good for first time exercisers, but I think there are much better workouts out there that incorporate cardio and weights.",1197936000,21,1099,4.285024154589372
2778567,5,B000NQRSBA,"I really like this video. I've been doing it for the last 2 weeks and am very sore, so it is definitely effective. It is quick and to the point. Your heart rate stays pretty elevated while you move right from one exercise to the next. There are no complicated moves, just weights and a few cardio sessions. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I'm now buying the rest of her videos.",1197504000,10,392,4.383561643835616
2778568,5,B000NQRSBA,"This Video has two 30 minute workouts. Most Video's I have purchased don't seem to be effective. This Video get's you sweating but keeps it in limits. I definetly feel it the next day. Jeanette gives an option for beginners by letting them only do 15 reps while doing the exercises, experienced exercisers do 25 reps. You can also change the workout level by using different sizes of weights. Both Videos include legs, arms and abdominal muscle workouts. Jeanette uses her usual happy manorism to make the Video's joyful to watch.",1195776000,11,530,4.835164835164835

2778571,5,B000NQRSBA,"I have to say that I'd never heard of Jeanette before, nor did I know how good (or not good) her workouts were.  However, I took a chance and I'm really happy I did.  This is a fantastic workout and it's enjoyable and fun.
It's fast paced, and it's interval cardio with weights for body sculpting.  You burn lots of fat and calories and have fun while doing it.  The choreography is easy to follow along to.  There is nothing too fancy; - your usual pushups and squats etc, but they are concentrated moves so while there are quite a few reps, you are getting excellent results.  The cardio is also easy to follow and all you really need are some weights so it's easy to get started.  Jeanette is friendly and professional and based on this, I'd definately look out for other titles by her.",1191801600,24,789,4.363013698630137

2778597,4,B000NQRSBA,"OUCH!  When I first started the video, I thought it was going to be too easy.  She really works you into a serious workout routine.  I did the first series on the video, and today my quads are screaming at me!  I like that this is a quick and efficient workout.  I can imagine that doing this video for 21 days in a row would yield some serious results.  I workout at my gym 2-3 days per week and got this video as a supplement to do on my off days.  My only wish was that there were more cardio.",1416268800,,496,3.9

2778623,4,B000NQRSBA,"I am thrilled to have this basic training circuit training dvd. I'm recovering from a car accident and it was gentle enough but also challenging enough for me to ease back into exercise. It can be done in a relatively small space. No complicated routines but they are still very effective and challenging. My whole body is being worked out and that is exactly what I was looking for. I have other DVDs but this is my go to one.
I would have given it 5 stars (too bad they don't have half stars) except sometimes the counting was off but it really didn't matter in the long run. I think instructors should have someone on the other side of the camera with a countdown clock or cards so the instructor doesn't miss the repitition count.",1403654400,,734,4.404411764705882
2778624,4,B000NQRSBA,I like this DVD. Can't claim I am doing it as often as I should but it's for all levels and she is pleasant enough to make the time you spend together AOK. She does not take herself too seriously. People of all shapes and ages doing the exercises. Prepare to be sore when muscles are put back into service.,1399161600,,306,4.116666666666666

2778626,5,B000NQRSBA,Didn't think I would sweat at first but I did and I love that the moves/explanations are easy and not complicated. I am new to Jeanette Jenkins' workouts but I love her energy and enthusiasm. I use this along with the Cardio Kickboxing DVD on alternate days and I am noticing a change in my body. My butt is definitely getting lifted and my arms finally losing their bat wings. Very happy with my purchase.,1387497600,2,406,4.426666666666667

2778631,5,B000NQRSBA,"I love this workout! I am about 50lbs overweight and just started working out a couple of weeks ago. This workout had me sweating during the warm up! But I was not so exhausted and out of breath that I couldn't complete the entire Circuit (I only do 1 circuit per day & each circuit is about 40 mins long). I really like that she had someone doing the modified version (which is what I did). I also like that she has men and women with different shapes and sizes working out with her.  The only issue I had is that she loses count sometimes but it's not a big deal to me. There are push-ups, squats, lunges and crunches (just to name a few) on this DVD which I usually hate but I didn't mind them with this routine and I like her energetic personality. At first I dreaded doing a 40 min workout but this workout was so fun that it made time fly by!",1334016000,4,848,4.077844311377246
2778632,5,B000NQRSBA,"I've never been physically active until about a year ago. I began seeing a trainer in January of 2011 and lost 15 pounds. After moving to a different city, I decided I needed to keep up the momentum and decided on this video. I wasn't ready for Jillian Michaels but I knew this was something I might be able to do. I am so glad I tried.

Jenkins uses basic moves but makes them more difficult with weights. After using this dvd for the first week, I was SORE! I couldn't lift my arms to use the phone or wash my back in the shower! It was pretty intense. I would definitely not recommend this for a beginner, it is best for someone who is low-intermediate.

I do admit Jenkins jokes can be annoying after using the dvd for a couple weeks but her upbeat personality is helpful the first couple times I watched.

I used this video for strictly 21 days, taking a rest every 7th day, and lost 3 pounds (141 to 138), which is at a very healthy rate, while eating healthy. However, it looks like I lost more because I've lost inches, which is always better than losing pounds (the scale can be useless when gaining muscle). I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",1331078400,2,1162,4.321100917431193
2778633,5,B000NQRSBA,"This is a very motivating video.  The moves are very simple and Jeanette is a fun trainer.  I use this as an alternate on my gym days or doing my ""power workout"" days. I will be purchasing more of her videos in the future.",1326758400,,222,4.0227272727272725
2778634,5,B000NQRSBA,"I am a busy stay-at-home mother and I enjoy alternating between circuit A & B during my kids nap-time everyday. After 2 weeks I noticed results, losing weight, and more energy. Others have noticed too. This was just what I needed. The exercises, for me, are very basic but kept me working hard. I can see how someone that is intermediate may get bored with it. At times it may be a little too slow or too basic; though Jeanette says you can increase the weights for a harder workout. You could probably do circuits A & B for more of a challenge if have time.

I will be purchasing more of her fitness dvd's. She is very encouraging and kept the workout fun. Though it's a challenge for me, I honestly look forward to my workouts (lunges yuck!). If you are looking for something basic where you don't have to struggle to figure out the moves as well as something quick; this is well worth the money. I have other DVD's but had to struggle or do it so many times to get the moves down.",1319155200,10,983,4.25668449197861

Great lower body excercises.",1269388800,,166,4.15625
2778638,5,B000NQRSBA,"One of the best workout DVDs I've found after trying out dozens of trainers and their programs.  This DVD has two great sessions, under 40 minutes each, that are low-impact without being too easy or boring.  I love Jenkin's humor and appreciate that she doesn't annoyingly yell at exercisers to move faster or work harder or ""get that leg higher.""  She's encouraging and supportive.  I look forward to my workouts now.",1268352000,2,418,4.845070422535211
2778639,4,B000NQRSBA,"As a beginning exerciser looking to lose 15 pounds, I can say that this workout is exactly what I was looking for. Generally, I dread circuit training workouts, but I don't mind this one at all. Some say the moves are basic, but I like that about the workout. They are tried and true moves that are easy to follow. It gets my heart rate up really well, but doesn't make me feel like dying like Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred. I can see how this might not be ideal for advanced exercisers, it is great for beginners, intermediate, and advanced (using heavier weights).

Alternating circuits taking a break every 5th day for 3 weeks has helped me lose 7 pounds without really changing my diet. And there is no dread factor.",1258848000,19,721,4.462121212121212
2778640,4,B000NQRSBA,Jeanette Jenkins: Hollywood Trainer 21 Day Total Body Circuit  was recommended by Fitness Magazine.  I was pleased with the price.  I found the DVD to be a very useful addition to my library of tapes.  It could be part of a daily regimen which would include either the A or the B workout after a half hour of some cardio work (I have a Nordic Track cross country ski machine),1254787200,,375,4.314285714285714
2778641,4,B000NQRSBA,I love this workout because she targets different muscles.  She has a good personality that helps you forget how hard you are working.  I will say that the cardio is not as intense as I need it to be.  Overall great DVD.  4 stars just because the cardio is not intense so I not dripping with sweat at the end (i'm sorry it sounds crazy but I need to feel like I've worked out).,1250208000,,377,4.054054054054054

2778654,5,B000NQRSBA,"I love this DVD. I did both circuits in one day and I'm feeling it. However, what I like best about the DVD is Jeanette. Not only does she provide useful information throughout the workout, but she gets goofy too. I love that. It makes me feel like I'm part of the class. There are instructors out there that are great at teaching, but there are very few that are engaging and make you forget how hard you are working out. It encourages me to keep going.",1227571200,4,454,4.2298850574712645
2778655,4,B000NQRSBA,"This is a good exercise dvd and offers two different workouts.  The only thing is they should be more different - not the same exercises for obliques or quads, change it up a bit.  In any case Jeannette is a keeper.",1225065600,,215,4.219512195121951
2778656,3,B000NQRSBA,"Circuit A is excellent.  Great workout to grow into if you're a beginner, but will still challenge the more fit.  Someone is doing the low-impact version the whole time, or you can follow the instructor for maximum impact.  Circuit B was kind of annoying to me; the instructor is goofing off and keeps losing count of the reps.",1224460800,2,327,4.603448275862069
2778657,3,B000NQRSBA,"Overall I enjoyed the workout. It's a very basic, very straight forward mix of resistance exercises with quick cardio intermissions. The cardio is even more basic and it won't raise your heartbeat too much. But it's nicely mixed to add variety. You will need dumbbells and optionally leg weights and you will do all the basic upper body exercises plus a mix of lunges, squats and ab work. It sounds a little trite but it's a satisfactory and well rounded resistance workout and it won't overwhelm you if you are a beginner. You can do the whole thing which is a little more than 60' or a single workout which lasts for about 35'.

Having said this, I must say I got extremely annoyed with the instructor's style. I wasn't familiar with her and it just struck me how she used every possible chance to crack jokes (bad ones), sing and dance (because 'the rhythm just resonates through her body') and generally do everything she could to make me cringe. I guess some people like this sort of bubbliness but me, I prefer a more neutral style and definitely someone who can count. If I want jokes I'll get a stand up comedy dvd, thank you very much.",1222041600,4,1144,4.5
2778658,4,B000NQRSBA,These are two good workouts for days when you don't have too much time. Trouble is the instructor.. She is projects way too much and doesn't seem to realize that her style is not appropriate for the DVD format.  The joke that is funny the first time is not funny after that. I bet if she had to pop this DVD in and try and workout to it every day for a week she would be ready to gag before the end of the week.  Instructors need to keep it simple and not get funny or cute during the workout. Also save the special instructions for the introduction when it will be viewed once for informational purposes but won't need to be heard every time the video is played ad nauseam.,1212883200,2,674,4.137404580152672

2778660,3,B000NQRSBA,"I bought Jeanette's new book which came with a DVD that includes this set of workouts plus the core and stretch workouts. I was disappointed. Her original Hollywood Trainer workouts also alternate cardio and weight work. I tried the first circuit workout on the DVD and felt that there were too few reps and actually very little cardio, so the breaks between weight sets seemed wasted.

If you do both circuits, you do get a full-body workout, but you're better off doing just ONE of her original workouts. In those, you'll get an at-least-intermediate-level weight workout plus cardio blasts in between all in under an hour.

If you want a good intermediate to high intermediate workout, check out her original Hollywood Trainer Cardiosculpt or Kickbox workouts.

The various exercises that Jeannette chooses are ones that you will certainly have seen before.  But, it's Jeannette's terrific personality that makes the workout fun and keeps you motivated.  As always, if you need to up your game, you can add ankle weights and increase your hand weights.  Jeannette also provides a modifier for those who are beginners.

I am glad that Amazon has it so I can get back into a good and effective fitness routine.  If you like Tae Bo, Shuan T, and Insanity, then this is not for you.  If you like Denise Austin or Gilad, the tried and true.  Give this one a try.  She is not like Denise or Gilad, but she sticks to what works.  I began using this DVD in my late 20's and nearly 10 years later, it still works.",1482192000,,716,3.8958333333333335
