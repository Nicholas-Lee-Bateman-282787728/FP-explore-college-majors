8258011,3,B0015ASJ3Y,Watched it and looks like a very easy and short 25-30 minute workout. Lots of yoga stretching. Good for learning how to do the positions on the ball. Will use for a relaxing quite stretching time when I don't want to workout to hard or on a Sunday after sitting on a hard church bench and my back is hurting.,1403222400,,308,4.15
