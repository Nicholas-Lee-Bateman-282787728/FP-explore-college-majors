I'd originally gotten on line to buy the DVD set of 'Everest Beyond the Limit', but I must say that the feature of Amazon that gives you 'customers who viewed this item, also looked at . . . "" REALLY was a great utility in this case. Rather than support and shell out money for the tourist show, I found a series of DVDs (Eiger Solo was good too, and Cho Oyu was even better) that were less 'touristy'. This is a combination of historic narration, historic reenactment (nicely done), and a modern day ascent. All very well done, and I'd highly recommend this nature of DVD if you're suffering from from a bit of wanderlust!",1200268800,,796,4.458904109589041
8083990,5,B000B9WF0S,"An excellent film showing that climbers from years ago carried out a very difficult climbing in horrendous conditions achieved a feat that today, with modern gear, would still be refarded as an excellent achievement",1198627200,,215,5.352941176470588
8083991,5,B000B9WF0S,This dvd gives a great overview of the Matterhorn climb.  The north face in winter is amazing.  Most people can hope to do the Hornli Ridge in the Summer.,1179273600,2,154,4.275862068965517
8083992,4,B000B9WF0S,For some reason you can't find too much literature or DVD footage on Matterhorn....so I was especially glad to have this piece. It is not a modern documentary but it is expertly shot and during the movie you keep wondering how on Earth could these shots be made in such and exposed terrain and extreme weather.,1171756800,2,310,4.553571428571429
8083993,4,B000B9WF0S,"This is a very good VHS focusing on a winter ascent and the history of North Face of Matterhorn. You'll get to see the heart of winter mountaineering including frostbites, falling stones and storms. I'll give this four stars instead of five only because of the Macrovision copy protectection which makes the picture flick in my TV. Cant wait for the DVD release...",1127088000,,364,4.7936507936507935
