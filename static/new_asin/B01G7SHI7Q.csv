8762488,1,B01G7SHI7Q,"What an absolute waste. If this is the future of the black race, I can do nothing but shake my head with misgiving. The complete lack of self respect, individually and collectively, is simply beyond belief. The use of the ""N"" word; expelled rapid fire, in the utterance of even the simplest of communication, is so off putting one can barely stand to watch the first 5 minutes of this film, and continues throughout.  The content is ignorant, the message is hopeless, and the delivery is useless--sending this ""alleged"" documentary to the absolute bottom of the list for me. There is nothing to be proud of here, nothing.  I am greatly saddened by what I've seen.  In bits and pieces over much of my life, I've gradually been made aware of the social condition present in various places throughout the United States.  However, this is the first ""firehose"" treatment of this kind of ignorance I have ever endured.  Unless you are a gangbanger reviling in how self-destructive you have become, this film will offer you nothing. This is not history, it is not informative, enlightening or reassuring in any way.  One could almost weep at how low the future of a race has driven itself. No one made this happen but the individuals accepting this as a way of communicating, of living, of being.

The truth is, the cure for cancer might be amongst those portrayed in the film. You might be looking at a great black poet, author, teacher, politician or scientist. But not on this path. Not on the path so proudly displayed here, and, it is all by choice. Very sad indeed.",1520208000,,1564,4.665454545454545

8762492,4,B01G7SHI7Q,"This is a film by Crip leader Terrance Davis who calls himself ""King Greatness"" as those are perhaps the only two words he doesn't mispronounce as he narrates this documentary. Now South Carolina is not LA or Atlanta. In order to make them the most violent etc. it has to use per capita statistics. Davis points out SC is at a crossroads between various areas. He uses mostly existing public news items to explain the history of drugs in SC in relationship to legislation and historical events. He provides some minor insight with his own experiences at a bowling alley. The film also shows gang members doing gang signals for the camera. They don't wear backwards ball caps in SC. We don't have a team.

This is an interesting documentary for those of us who live in this state and I would think would hold some interest for those who don't. The film uses a hip-hop instrumental background repeating the same gansta riff over and over. I don't recall any swearing. 3 1/2 stars",1480723200,,977,4.614942528735632
