6516170,4,B00LYHXHUI,"This movie is very funny and touching.  The performances are amazing, the sets look fantastic, and the cast is perfect!  People giving this one star clearly do not realize that it's not supposed to be a sci-fi movie.  It's an extremely dark comedy about the cultural barriers in the 1970's.  Every piece of dialogue has subtext.  No one says what they really mean.  This will resonate with people who generally find most theatrical releases trite and boring.",1411776000,30,458,4.883116883116883
6516171,1,B00LYHXHUI,Simply the worse SciFi movie I've seem. The sets weren't bad but there was the worse acting and writing. The cast have done good work in the past. So why would they do this movie. It was so slow and boring. Why spend money on sets and effects but none on a script. I'm just shocked that they would even release it. A total waste of time. 1 star is being way to generous but that's the lowest aloud. I've never written a review before but just wanted to warn people that this movie sucks.,1411689600,,487,4.136842105263158
6516172,5,B00LYHXHUI,"this is highbrow black comedy...very unique and original with many sub-plots and unearths the underbelly of the ""June Cleaver"" world..touching on many subjects that we will remember from the 70's but also that are 100% pertinent today and will be in the future..very rarely does a movie come along like this with so many elements , sub-plots and layers and manage to engage and move the audience in many different ways...Like great plays...it's not the special effects or scenes, even though they are really really good, it's the characters that really move you and make you think. The musical score is really beautiful and hauntingly engaging.",1411603200,12,644,5.084905660377358
6516173,4,B00LYHXHUI,"I saw this film at a theater in Los Angeles. SS76 attempts - and succeeds - at something I don't think has ever been attempted: a vision of the distant future through the retro-lens of a bygone era, the '70s. The sets and technology and props look like they were imagined by a production designer that was frozen in time circa 1976 - as do the costumes. Similarly, the fixations, insecurities and neuroses of the various characters, while universal even today, are dealt with via attitudes that clearly come straight out of that ""me"" decade as well - and to very funny effect. The additional infusion of craftiness and color that a sci-fi environment can bring is not lost on the makers of this film. Story elements & devices that help draw the characters' arcs are of the kind only possible in this future-world. Or only possible in outer space. There are winks & nods in the script (and even in subtle prop gags) that collectively remind us how much really has changed, that we in 2014 really are in a very different future. We didn't go where these people went. But by that I do not mean we don't have space stations circling other worlds yet, or artificial gravity yet... It's something else - perhaps enlightenment? And it is our advancement in that area that gives us the context in which to giggle (sometimes uncomfortably) at this group of self-absorbed yet charming misfits, who really are profiles of just about anyone you or I knew (yes, I'm going to do it) a long time ago, in a decade far (but not THAT far) away... (Sorry.)  If you liked Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"", or ""Space: 1999"" or any other '70's sci-fi outings, you'll surely love this gem.",1411430400,47,1659,4.567114093959732
6516174,1,B00LYHXHUI,"So, this attempt at a comedy in space leaves me wondering who the heck thought the idea alone of making a movie in 2013/14 about what people probably thought the future would be like just before Star Wars came out in 1977? That's the whole joke of the movie. Funny right? Yeah, it's hilarious :S

So a bunch of people are on a space station and they interact. The dialog is mostly annoying, cringe-worthy, or boring. There are not classic moments, no memorable moments, and no funny moments. I did not laugh or even chuckle once during this god awful abomination at nothingness and what it did try to go for was predictable and eye rolling.

I think this might even contend for worst sci fi comedy of all time, up there with ""plan 9 from outer space"".

So, the whole joke of this film is trying to make you laugh by them using robots toys of the 70's as things that are useful in the future. MMMkay. Maybe it's so funny I broke a laugh muscle and just can't hear myself laughing anymore? That or it was an utter waste of time.",1411344000,2,1026,4.305699481865285

6516194,1,B00LYHXHUI,"This movie's trailer is very well done. It takes what is basically a clever idea, and sells you on the thought that you'll be in for a hilarious good time.  Beware, however, that not everything is as it seems. We're given the the premise of a space station that exists in the mid-1970s, with all  of the bizarre eccentricities that go along with that decade.  If the film had maintained that idea in a comedic fashion,  it could've been a lot of fun. Instead, what we get is a strangely dark commentary on suburban life in the 1970s, under the guise  of a science-fiction comedy.  There's a lot of drug use, gratuitous nudity,  implied sex - and that's just for starters.  The worst thing is, the movie is just no fun at all. It has some kind of agenda that I won't go into, but be advised that this is definitely not for kids.",1507161600,,827,4.324675324675325

6516196,5,B00LYHXHUI,"I bought this movie based on a recommendation from a Space 1999 group on Facebook. I was very glad I went ahead and got it! The dark comedy stars Patrick Wilson (Night Owl II from 2009's Watchmen) as the Captain of a space station that serves as a fueling depot and rest stop for cargo and passenger transports. Also stars Liv Tyler (Armageddon, Super) as his new assistant, Marisa Coughlin (Super Troopers), Jerry McConnell (Sliders), Matt Bomer (Magnificent Seven), and Keir Dullea (2001) in a small cameo. Keep in mind this is a dark comedy, so it's not going to funny ha-ha, but the effects are well done and the little robots are charming. The settings and music (Todd Rundgren songs appear numerous times on the soundtrack list) are very much inspired by '70's sci-fi. Overall, a darkly humorous film with original characters that either inspire, frustrate, or amuse.

Be forewarned; If you do not ""get"" dark humor, you will not like this movie! But if you're a fan of this kind of humor, and you loved John Carpenter's Darkstar, get it!",1494806400,,1043,4.730769230769231

That would take a modicum of writing talent and actually enhance the plot of which there's practically none.  Destroying the station would put the audience out of their misery.  Nothing happens.  Not even an alarm.  Not a word about surviving their close call with death or the possibility of more space junk heading their way.  Space Junk. Now that would be a good title.

6516220,2,B00LYHXHUI,"The trailer made it look like a solid comedy through and through.  It's actually a drama.  The concept (the 1970's vision of sci-fi) is a goldmine for comedy.  Looking at most actual '70's sci-fi can be hilarious enough.  Making an intentional comedy with that as the base material should've been easy but this just didn't take full advantage of it.  While there are some good jokes revolving around what people thought the future would look like back in the '70s, the film takes off in a serious direction getting deep into the personal issues of the characters and the relations between them.  The main plot didn't even really rely on a sci-fi backdrop.  The producers of this totally dropped the ball.",1463529600,,704,4.768595041322314
6516221,2,B00LYHXHUI,"Unique? Yup.
Clever pretense? Definitely.
Worth renting? Barely.

I thought this had a tremendous amount of potential. A retro-future sci-fi dark comedy using yesterday's tomorrow, today? Brilliant! Unfortunately, although the visuals are beautiful and the pretense itself gets two stars, the movie comes off as forced and ham-fisted. And not in a deliberate way, either.

From some of the earliest dialogue, SS76's pace seems forced and awkward. At first I thought this was foreshadowing for some subplot that would be explained later, or at least a blueprint (albeit a heavy-handed one) of the relationship between two characters who just met. Nope; for the full 90 minutes, every bit of dialogue seems like it was scraped from the darkest corners of community fanfic sites. Although the actors are incredibly talented and capable of so much more, the lines come across as if the writers are trying to force-feed us a story.

In the final 10-15 minutes of the movie, there's a noticeable shift in the pace and tone of the writing. It's as if a new writing team took over and spent those final ten minutes desperately performing CPR on the movie trying to bring it back. Unfortunately the improvement is too late and the payoff isn't particularly noteworthy, and the film comes across as a made-for-TV movie. I mean a really bad, early-90s made-for-TV movie that even the cable-only channels turned down. And unfortunately, it's not even deliberately over the top in the vein of a self-satirizing sci-fi take on Kentucky Fried Movie. This was meant to be a dark comedy / sci-fi flick, and it just doesn't deliver.

The set design was fantastic! Imagine any given 70s sci-fi flick done using modern techniques, and you get the idea. Unfortunately, it's clear the writers thought they were being deeply clever, and that's just not the case.

All of the characters have issues and yes a good film is going to have characters that have some kind of emotional issues. However, in this movie (won't call it a film) the characters have depressing issues. Not really sure why it is categorized as a comedy because it really is a depressing film. Back to the depressing character issues--in most films the emotional issues are usually resolved by the end.  Most characters will have some kind of arc but not in this film. The end of the film is not different than the beginning except the some of the issues are brought to light in a public way at a Christmas party. And other than that life goes on in the same depressed way out in space. If you are a die hard Matt Bomer fan watch the movie as you get to his work, which is phenomenal as usual.

6516358,2,B00LYHXHUI,"Take one jaded part American Beauty, another kitschy part Dark Star, and an eco-message minded third part Silent Running, mix in an overwhelming dose of 1970s style and upper middle class American vapidity, and sprinkle with a dash of semi-relevant movie stars (Patrick Wilson; Liv Tyler; Matt Bomer; Jerry OConnell; and Marisa Coughlin) and you come up with this dramedy that misses on the comedy end.  The pick-me-up set-up is supposed to be a throwback to futuristic visions of space life, as set in a future that apes 1970s American style and sentiment.  Upon the station arrives attractive and slightly haunted Jessica (Liv Tyler), a navigations specialist, who threatens the masculine leadership of Captain Glenn (Patrick Wilson), constantly on the verge of coming unglued as he lost his male lover and wants to keep this a secret (though seems everyone knows).  Ted (Bomer) is a crippled ships tech living in a loveless marriage with the self-involved Misty (Coughlin) and he falls for Jessica while having visions of a physically perfect woman and smoking some space weed.  In the end everyones troubles and darkness is exposed in front of each other.  Still, no one is a big happy family and the only epiphanies that the characters go through lead to self-absorbed and hedonist conclusions.

6516359,2,B00LYHXHUI,"Liv Tyler plays a new First Mate arriving on some space station to aid the closeted, alcoholic Captain (Patrick Wilson). The idea is that this is made in the 1970's but set in the future and so we have sexism, smoking, flares, groovy music and as many clichs as they can cram in. The sets too are reminiscent of the brilliant `Space 1999' - no other comparisons apply - sadly.

Once on board it becomes clear that everyone has `issues' and at first what seems like quirkiness - especially from `Misty' soon becomes one long monologue of irritating self interest guff. The joke, if you can call it that, wears thin pretty quick. I can not remember even smiling at any of this. The acting is so stylised as to not work either. Everyone ranges from unlikable to uninteresting. The film is supposed to be about the similarity between asteroids and humans (I think) and we see an asteroid belt starting to break up at the beginning with the inevitable sign post that the space station will get hit etc. This being a metaphor for human relationships or something that I lost interest in trying to work out.

I keep trying to find something good to say about this chunderthon and the only one I can think of is that it does actually end - eventually. You will want an asteroid explosion by about half way through, but don't hold your breath. There is no plot worth talking about, no humour and objectively speaking no ruddy point to this total waste of everyone's time - theirs for being in it and yours for watching it.

6516403,2,B00LYHXHUI,"Our friends thought this would be a funny 70s-retro science fiction movie.  And, although there were some humorous moments, most of it was slow and depressing.  The basic plot was about a bunch of miserable, unpleasant people on a futuristic space station.  This is one of those movies featuring maladjusted jerks that I suppose some people see as a meaningful social study.  It kind of reminds me of the book ""A Thousand Acres"" I read for a class once - by the end I couldn't help but feel that the people were pretty much selfish, self-absorbed mopers and I hardly cared what happened to them.  To be fair, in this movie there are two characters (Liv Tyler's and a little girl) who are perfectly decent, but they start out unhappy and nothing happens to change their condition.  And that's the other thing - the movie introduces these miserable people, some of whom are jerks, and then NOTHING CHANGES.  At the end the jerks are still jerks, and the unhappy people are still unhappy.  There's no progress.  (There's a mopey gay guy who finds a potential love interest at the end, but he's still a jerk as far as we know).  The kitschy 70s-retro aspect has some fun moments, but also revolves around a lot of smoking (both tobacco and weed); as a non-smoker I don't really enjoy watching people smoke so that's kind of repulsive.  Also, there's a few naked women and exposed boobs, if you like that sort of thing.  Otherwise, not so much a comedy/fun movie or really much science-fiction, but more for those who like artsy, slow-moving movies about miserable people.",1420934400,,1567,4.678832116788321

The thing is also irresponsibly directed. For example, there are scenes where a mother is telling her child she shouldn't have touched the gerbil's babies because then the gerbil will eat them, then she picks up the dead, supposedly eaten babies and puts them in a plastic bag and throws them in the trash.

At first, I expected a film that had a 1970's visual aesthetic, but clearly the film literally transports you to a more space-faring 1970's human civilization. The movie even goes as far as bringing back the bad parts of previous decades; acceptance, smoking in front of babies, drinking while breast feeding etc.

Think of not as a comedy.
First, let's get this out there. The word ""comedy"" can be a bit misleading. This movie is not any more humorous than Dante's Divine Comedy, which is not a comedy(at least, not one as we know it). Back in the renaissance, a ""High Comedy"" was a tragedy, whilst a ""Low Comedy"" was more humor based. I like to think of this movie as being the former. There are spots of awkward moments that produce hints of humorous undertones, but they usually take the form of something born of madness. In fact, it's better to understand that this crew has lived in isolation for so long and with so few a population, that they are mad in their own ways.

About
The movie follows two couples undergoing marital issues, as well as three individuals; a person who's having a hard time coming to terms with his identity and personal feelings, a new girl who wants nothing more than to be professional and accepted, and a child of one of the aforementioned couples. If you are looking for something with a space theme and sci-fi elements, or you are hoping it will be funny, this is not for you.  It is an acquired taste. I watch a lot of British films and so, I appreciated the movie very much. Be warned, there is no happy ending and nor is there any closure, save, for one person and that is little more than a glimmer of hope, if anything. I like to call this movie a ""Little Miss Sunshine in Space,"" but with no closure and less humor. If you have seen Little Miss Sunshine, think of watching that movie all the way up until it's critical/ breaking point and then shut off and imagine curtains drawing. This is NOT Galaxy Quest or anything remotely relevant.

My Thoughts
I appreciated this movie as I had found many parts of it that I could relate to, as I felt my personal being resonating in Matt Bomer's character. It was almost therapeutic for me and my wife to watch, and somewhat comforting...but more importantly, it activated a sense of empathy into this couple, which made me appreciate their situation more. I think anyone that watches this movie will be able to relate to many things.

One thing that bothered me, was, that there appear to be more people on this station than lead to believe. In various scenes, you see many new faces and yet, the movie paints the picture that only these two couples and individuals are the only affected by life in the station...or exist on the station all together. In fact, the only people you see walking down the hallway are the primary cast...what of the others?",1419206400,,2875,4.531791907514451
6516426,5,B00LYHXHUI,"Forgive me if this review makes zero sense...I don't know exactly how to put it, but I know I need to try.

Space Station 76 was promoted as a quirky comedy. It isn't.

On first viewing, I didn't really get it. I was waiting for punchlines, I was ready to laugh out loud: but I didnt. There was definitely a comedic air about it, there were moments I was smiling from ear to ear at the disco-psychedelic-space atmosphere, the ""swooshing"" doors and the computer voice that announces every function of the ship as it is employed or disengaged, but I was confused.

""This is kind of dark..."", I kept thinking, ""am I supposed to be laughing?""

But as the film came to its end, I realized the point, and that I had missed it all along. Maybe it was the misleading promotional trailer that skewed my expectations? Maybe it just requires a second viewing to fully grasp? For whatever reason, I kept mulling it over in my mind after it was over.

And I love a film that makes me do that.

It had me thinking of the problems and dysfunctional relationships the crew mates endured, that we as people endure, and how it is wrapped in a caricature of today's society - blown to the cartoony proportions of 1970's life.

It made me think, ""wow, thank God we didn't become an interstellar species during the '70s"", which made me realize, ""wow, thank God we still haven't become an interstellar species"". I took the point as: ""look how laughably petty we are. Look how far we have to go, but can't see it.""

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm the moron trying to find meaning in a dark comedy. Regardless, like ""The Big Lebowski"" (though that is a better film in my opinion), this one is hard to pin, but rest assured, it is worth a try.",1419206400,10,1714,4.401898734177215

It seems like they couldn't decide whether to mock the 1970's sci-fi genre or to do it straight, so they hedged their bets and did maybe a little of both, ultimately achieving a vaguely neurotic blandness where every moment ended up being a tease at actually being funny, but never materialized into any such thing.

It isn't what it was promoted as.
The comedy moments were almost all in the trailer and the tone of the whole movie was more in line with an American 1970s melodrama. Obviously repressed and mismatched couples and characters had predictable paths through a story with no plot, no tension beyond the obvious and the ending was totally a waste of the high production standards.
The film looked visually nice, exactly in line with what I thought it would be. Convincing SFX and a consistent visual style, but the script really needed a massive rewrite. It could have been ""Star Trek meets Airplane"", but felt more like the kind of tedious film Airplane was sending up.

The opening scene, with the captain sitting at the console as an unidentified shuttle-pod arrives, and he holds his hand hesitantly over a big red button, depressing it and prompting an ominous count down. Then 'pop', the button ejects, revealing itself as a cigarette lighter - having nothing to do with the shuttle-pod's arrival. This is comedy. Unfortunately this was also revealed in the trailer, which dulled the punch from this opening scene. And then... there's no more comedy in the whole movie!? (Well, there was one moment with a cyber-genetic prosthetic hand gone awry on the lieutenant's breast, but that was far from par for the course.)

This seemed like a short film, only longer. Which is to say, nothing happened that couldn't have been wrapped up far more economically in about 15 minutes.

And it's no dig against the melodrama, but they lead us to believe we'd be laughing. Not feeling sorry for everyone's miserable existence in the midst of all the missed opportunities for comedic exploits.

6516545,2,B00LYHXHUI,"Before renting this movie, I read the reviews, and so I watched it knowing full well it was an unusual entry into the science fiction genre. Despite that, I still was left completely disappointed with this movie, more because of its failure to make use of so much of what thematically inspired it.

I grew up watching Buck Rogers, fondly remember Space Academy, saw every episode of Space: 1999, raced home from school to catch Lost in Space reruns, etc. I've always been a science fiction buff. At the same time, I appreciate movies that defy existing conventions, and especially enjoy films that resist the temptation to have a Spielberg (formerly Disney) happy ending. When I saw the trailer for Space Station 76, I thought that if nothing else, they clearly nailed the set design.

In this, I was more right than I thought. Yes, they nailed the set design (and costumes). And that's it. Nearly everything else about this movie falls flat. Some examples (minor spoilers):

* The captain is supposed to have a drinking problem, yet I know actual alcoholics that are less functional than he is
* Several ""secrets"" are revealed to the audience early on. Exactly one of them gets revealed (and a second one almost does). The revelation has absolutely no consequences to anyone.
* A bionic limb malfunctions in a way that is clearly supposed to be comedic. It isn't, not even at a juvenile level.
* Speaking of no consequences, the director sets up an obviously climactic event. Nothing actually happens; no one even bruises their elbow (apologies Douglas Adams).

I could go on. I won't. Another reviewer, praising this movie, said that it is not sci-fi but a suburban drama about isolation. I tend to agree with that statement, but then why bother with the gorgeous sets and costuming? They contributed nothing to the plot, such as it is. This movie could have been dropped whole cloth into a different thematic genre without affecting the story. Add to it that, even as a suburban drama, the movie fails to connect the audience with the sympathetic characters. I'm glad I only rented this. This movie could have been a refresh of the TV shows some of us grew up with, or a parody of those same shows. Instead, I walked away unsatisfied.

6516583,3,B00LYHXHUI,"Reviewers seem not to understand this movie because it was not what many were expecting. I had no idea what to expect, but I understand exactly what I saw.
First, this is NOT a comedy, nor even a dark comedy. If you take all the funny or absurd moments and splice them together into a trailer  as dishonest studios will do  you can make it look like a laugh-a-minute comedy. But it isnt, and doesnt want to be.
The key to the movie is given in the brief opening voiceover by Liv Tylers character. Shes not really talking about asteroids:

Ive always been amazed that asteroids can fly in groups for millions of years, and never touch each other or connect. They are dead rock

This movie is about alienation. The more the characters interact, the more distant from each other they seem. Like objects floating in weightlessness, two might eventually be drawn slowly into contact, and might stick, but are as likely to rebound from one another and drift back apart. By the end of the movie, when all the characters are in one place for the first time, they are more isolated from each other than ever. Its a rather sad movie, actually.
But is the sci-fi setting just a contrivance, arbitrarily chosen to host a mere human-relations story? I don't think so, for two reasons. The first is the surprising cameo by Keir Dullea, who played astronaut Dave Bowman in the very iconic 2001: A Space Odyssey.  (Look for him on a video telephone screen playing Livs father.) Bringing Dullea out of retirement is something only serious students of sci-fi would do.
The other reason comes from another line in the voiceover intro:

We also want to find that place of perfection The more you try to create a paradise, the more you will resent the prison. And all you're left with is dreams of a future that never happened.

So, some kind of warning to utopian dreamers of a Star Trek future, perhaps? If so, its hard to see how the remainder of the movie delivers on that intent.
What drew me to this movie is the chance for another view of that utopianism. I knew I was not going to find serious sci-fi; it had more the feel of a straight-to-DVD B movie. But Ive spent my whole life dreaming of various futures that never happened. A utopian ideal is definitely part of what some of us seek, and maybe thats what Futurism  past or present  is ultimately about. But I don't see how pursuing it results in a prison or anything to resent; on the contrary, it is the encroachments and limits of this world which threaten to become a prison to resent.
If this movie really was intended for people like thatlike methen the potential audience seems infinitesimal. What astonishes me about this movie is that it was made at all.
One aspect of the movie is superb, though Im not sure what to call it  art direction, perhaps. The producers have captured 70s Futurism perfectly  and I say that as someone just old enough to remember. The spaceships are more boxy than sleek, clean and gleaming, like a cross between a Ford Pinto and a Disney monorail. Spot on. They also did a remarkable job of finding or re-creating artifacts of the era, right down to the white suitcases Livs character carries as she arrives at the station. I could quibble with a few details, and would never mistake this for something actually made in the 1970s, but it is a thorough re-creation.
Liv Tyler doesnt have quite the girlish figure of her Lord of the Rings days, but she is still very appealing and sympathetic. The best performance is by Marisa Coughlan as the Farrah-maned Misty, the most screwed-up character on the station.
There are other attempts at metaphorism in the movie but they don't work well, and the ending is anticlimactic and not satisfactory at all. I wouldnt call this a good movie, but it does some subtle things well, with a light touch.",1413849600,11,3816,4.564327485380117

6516608,1,B00LYHXHUI,"OK, based on how most will like or dislike a film, I am going to step out on a limb and say, ""You are going to hate this film.""  :)  Yes.

But why?
The film suffers from VERY LITTLE movement toward a plot, very little reason for a plot, very little time spent on taking us anywhere at all.  Oh, there may be a plot.  But, it is not something that will stand out to you.
.
You will be annoyed (likely) that we move from one person's tragic issues to the next. You will like noone, except, perhaps the little girl...appropriately called SUNSHINE.  ""Aint no sunshine when she's gone.""  Only darkness of the other characters.  Everyone is self absorbed in their own issues. No one is likeable.

And the plot?  I couldn't be certain, but the fact that the girl sunshine is the only likable character, and the fact that she is the only one who doesn't let life overpower her, I would guess that the main plot is something like, ""All of the world lives for their own selves, creating great sadness and unhappiness. Be more like SUNSHINE... who (in zero gravity (no weight on her sholders!) can smile.

Yep... that may be all it is.  Or I might be off target.  Even if I am right, it hardly makes a viewer happy to sit through all the other miseries.  Dreadful.  Give me the two 30 second slices of the girl in zero gravity and throw the rest into a garbage can.

6516611,1,B00LYHXHUI,"The entire movie is spent building conflicts. Most of it seems to revolve around a jilted alcoholic gay stalker, leaving me thinking whatever committee tried to cobble this together was desperate to appeal to gay viewers, if only because somebody realized they had utterly failed to appeal to anyone else. They threw in a bunch of 70s references to play to nostalgia, but did it in a way that says ""We think people who watched sci-fi in the 70s are a bunch of drugged out losers who have no taste or sense"", and made some forced and idiotic attempts at humor that failed utterly. There are a few hints that somebody had a plot in mind at some point, but they all seem to vanish into nothingness. Finally, an event occurs that could signal a turning point... and the movie ends, leaving the audience with no closure, no resolution, and only one question: ""What was the point?""

I don't know if the writer or possibly writing committee botched an attempt to set up a cliffhanger, or if he was just too aimless, stupid and/or stoned to even think that coherently. Either way, the opening paragraph was pretty much gravy; the movie could be summed up with the following: Stupid drama stuff happens. Roll credits.

For people who LOVE sci-fi films from the 70's, this is a great throwback.  A lot of the technology on display here comes from a 70's perception of what the future might look like.  The costumes are also great throwbacks to the 70's.

As far as plot goes, there isn't much of a plot.  And that's what I loved about it.  This movie isn't conventional at all, and I love movies that steer clear of convention (as long as they do it properly).

It's hard to explain what this movie is, but it's basically a subtle-comedy/soap opera set onboard a space station in the future (with a huge throwback to the 70's).

6516631,1,B00LYHXHUI,"Just finished watching ""Space Station 76"" released by Sony Pictures.
I had such high hopes for ""Space Station 76"" when I first saw the previews for it online.  It seemed like it was going to be a disfunctional comedy that combined the best elements of Space 1999; Ark II, Space Academy; Silent Running; and other 1970s science fiction shows into what should have been a great spoof.
Sadly ""Space Station 76"" fell way short of my expectations.
I couldn't help feeling that Liv Tyler was channeling 1970s and 1980s actress Connie Scellaca in this role as the first female assistant captain of a space station - in this case Omega 76.
While ""Space Station 76"" does have its moments of insightful character study; everyone was too one dimensional and at times - especially the Captain - was pandering to the sterotypes - which a majority of 1970s science fiction shows didn't.  Spoiler alert here:  A major character, who only has about three minutes of screen time as a hologram in an interstellar phone call, obviously gets promoted by sleeping with the admiral...not sure this is something to promote as a good thing...just saying.
Now I know that this is supposed to be a quirky film festival favorite.  I just can't recommend it though.

6516648,4,B00LYHXHUI,"If you're expecting a comedy, you're better off looking elsewhere. Despite the label, I didn't find this film funny at all, but rather quite tragic with scattered moments of pitch-black humor.

That said, this was a rather clever and poignant allegory of middle- class suburban living aboard a spaceship floating through a region of space devoid of any other ships, inhabited planets or stations. It's this pervasive sense of isolation that becomes a recurring theme as we meet the motley crew of characters, each suffering from some form of emotional disconnect, not only from the rest of the station's crew, but from themselves as well. The themes present in this film are universal and are relevant today despite the retro setting.

These characters broke my heart, but none more so the leading trio of the captain, lieutenant and Ted played by Patrick Wilson, Liv Tyler and Matt Bomer respectively. Wilson's role in particular tugged at my heart. And of course Matt Bomer shines no matter what role he's given. His portrayal of Ted the welder comes across as extremely authentic despite the sometimes gauche elements of the film.

While I did enjoy the movie I found the ending a little abrupt and disappointing, as if they'd made their point and decided to leave it there instead of providing some sort of thematic resolution.

Don't watch Space Station 76 expecting a slick, CGI-tastic sci-fi movie. Similarly, don't go in expecting a raucously funny Austin Powers-esque romp. This movie is neither and so much more. It's a study of human nature and family drama, the secrets we keep from our loved ones and the lies we tell ourselves in order to survive the daily grind of existence.",1412467200,26,1690,4.919298245614035
6516649,5,B00LYHXHUI,"There are a lot of mixed reviews for this film and I'm sure it's not for everyone. My first question is to anyone... How old are you?
Starting with sets, costumes, hair/ make up and over all look and feel... this film is spot on. I enjoyed seeing the simplicity of the 70's on walls and clothing and yet it wasn't overdone. Special effects were nicely done and wish there were more people who actually appreciated the work that goes into them. Yes, it's set in space... In the future... But do you actually understand and get the point of the film?

The 70's were exactly like that and in today's 2014 we still see those scenarios and people.

Patrick Wilson gives a wonderful and heartbreaking performance. His character is riddled with all sorts of emotion and issues that hinge on one thing... Matt Bomer, who is such a wonderful character, an under appreciated man. (If I could capitalize and bold the . I would) He is the character in this film to love and you want only for him to tell everyone to go to hell.  Jerry O' Connell~ is ""that guy"". Smarmy fits him well. Keri Dullea... What a treat it is to see him.
I have to say I think the women in this film showed exactly how I view women. Marisa Coughlan is a combination of mothers my friends had. Self centered, detached, and thinks only of herself 100% of the time. She did a great job, I loathed this character as she is the type of woman I never wanted to become. Kali Rocha, another woman who is self centered and before the end of the film... Well, let's just say that moment is laugh out loud perfect. And then there's Liv Tyler... Who I've never really cared one way or another about. This film made me appreciate her as an actress. She shows many different emotions, many moments of sincerity, moments where she is vulnerable and then switches into a woman standing on her own.
Kylie Rogers... Sunshine.... What a wonderful performance. She is one of the best parts of this film. I adored her character. I wish many more good things to come her way.

If you look at the listing it says comedy, drama, sci-fi and it is all of those things combined, and equally so. I approached this film with a completely open mind and let me take me where it wanted to. I tended to see the story as a 51 year old who lived through the 70's would. I knew these people in my real life at one time. Well told, well executed. And done with a lot of heart. This film could not have said anything more. If I could change one thing it would be that the Captain would have failed at his quest just one more time. The bathtub scene had me cracking up only to be followed up by one more like it... I could have begged for one more.
Overall I agree ... This film is not for everyone. Is there any film you can name that is? Kudos to the team of SS76 for doing something different and achieving what I percieve to be a great message in a drama, set in space with some things you just can't help but laugh out loud at.",1412467200,7,2956,4.254448398576512
6516650,5,B00LYHXHUI,"This is a fantastic movie. It is not the comedy that it is marketed as but this darkly comic look at unhappy people living in the ""glorious"" future. This is definitely not a movie for anyone. It's got a slower pace, really dry humor and ends without everything being wrapped up perfectly but the characters are so perfectly drawn and there are some really great performances. I just loved this movie on so many levels and really recommend it if you are in the mood for something darkly comic.",1412467200,9,492,4.53932584269663

6516652,2,B00LYHXHUI,"Imagine if Wes Anderson made a sci-fi comedy, with that delightful retro sensibility that he loves so much. Except it lacks his cinematic touch, his quirkiness, and the wry humour.

Instead, ""Space Station 76"" feels like a vision of The Future as imagined by a clinically depressed suburbanite from 1976 -- think ""The Ice Storm"" in space, with robot hands, weed and cannibalistic gerbils. It has a talented cast that doesn't have a lot to do, and seems to be trying to amuse us with constant awkwardness in the hopes that this will elicit some chuckles... which, sadly, it rarely does.

A new second-in-command, Jessica Marlowe (Liv Tyler), is arriving on Space Station 76, which seems to just be in space to... um... I'm not entirely clear what its purpose is. The captain (Patrick Wilson) is suicidally depressed over his homo/bisexuality and the departure of the man he loved, and he's not too happy about having a female second-in-command.

And nobody else there is easier to live with. Brittle, pill-popping Misty (Marisa Coughlan) neglects her daughter and develops a nasty envy of Marlowe. She's also avoiding sex with her husband Ted (Matt Bomer wearing a ""robot hand"" glove), possibly because she is having an affair with Steve (Jerry O'Connell), whose perky wife Donna (Kali Rocha) is wrapped up in her new baby.

Jessica immediately forms a bond with both the sexually-frustrated Tedand his sensitive young daughter Sunshine (Kylie Rogers). A jealous Misty begins sabotaging Sunshine's friendship, and as the Christmas party approaches, the tensions among the crew reach a boiling point. Will anything actually get resolved, or will everything just continue as-is?

The most important aspect of science fiction is to imagine what might happen, to look forward. ""Space Station 76"" looks back instead -- the attitudes and angst of the 1970s transplanted into the science fiction settings that a movie from the 1970s might have had. It has very of-that-period viewpoints on things like women in positions of authority, sexuality, pill-popping housewives, affairs and all that sort of things. There are even CIGARETTES and VALIUM on the space station of Teh Future.

And this could have worked.... if I had the faintest idea what writer/director Jack Plotnick was aiming for. It's too serious to be wry, too depressing to be funny (even bleakly funny), too goofy to be dramatic, and too awkward to be clever. I've seen it billed as a ""black comedy,"" but those usually have... something to elicit even a chuckle.

Admittedly there are some mildly funny moments (the whole robot-hand-grabbing-the-breast scene, or the toaster scene), but too often Plotnick draws potentially funny scenes out until they seem limp and devoid of energy. Or else he lingers on running non-gags that just feel squirmingly uncomfortable (the whole subplot about the mother gerbil killing her babies).

And while he has a cute aesthetic for the 70s-style future -- think a cheaper version of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"" with lots of white walls and magic food dispensers -- the aesthetic seems to be all the movie has. The characters just float around, grate on each other, have a yelling match, and... nothing comes of it. It simply ends, with everyone (except perhaps the captain) still miserable and loathing each other.

It also tragically misuses most of its cast. Patrick Wilson is the only adult actor who has anything to actually chew on, playing a depressed, lonely commander hiding his sexuality (remember, 1970s sensibilities) and mourning rejection by the man he loved.

But sadly, Wilson is the only one whose character even has an arc. Liv Tyler is clearly trying hard with her character, but doesn't seem entirely sure who Jessica is or where she's coming from -- Jessica's only defining characteristic is a non-functioning uterus. Matt Bomer mostly smokes weed, flirts with Tyler and stares vacantly at naked women floating in space. O'Connell has nothing to do. And Marisa Coughlan is just a two-dimensional unhappy suburban wife... but in space, which makes that totally not a cliche.

""Space Station 76"" is a mass of squandered opportunities -- while the retro-SF setting is interesting, it lacks actual storylines or developed characters. At the end you're where the characters are -- floating in space, bored and unhappy.",1412208000,5,4329,5.108910891089109

6516654,4,B00LYHXHUI,"In order to appreciate or even enjoy this film you almost have to know beforehand what happened to movies after 1977. You see films like Star Wars and then Raiders of the Lost Ark cranked up the pace and excitement level so much that films of this style ceased to exist. There was this small pocket of time post 2001 and pre George Lucas where these cheaply made space melodramas were released. Because of that some 40 years later we have this film...

Now on Space Station 76 it was an extremely interesting ride back in time. I am just not sure it was a place I wanted to revisit. I will give kudos to the prop department bringing in just about everything authentic you can think of from that era. I kinda liked it for that reason. I could not imagine anyone born after 1979 having any kind of interest in this film though. Watch at your own risk.",1412035200,7,849,4.30625
6516655,3,B00LYHXHUI,"""5...4...3...2...1...Blast Off."" Glenn (Wilson) is the captain of Omega 76, a space station that has it's share of problems. When Jessica (Tyler) is assigned to be the new assistant captain she has no idea what she is in for. What she finds is an unhappy captain unwilling to admit he is heading into an asteroid field. A technician who is unhappy, an housewife who self medicates and a woman who wants nothing more than to be the center of attention. She quickly finds out the only normal person on the ship is a young girl. This is another movie that is deceiving. The preview makes it look funny and almost like a spoof movie. This is nothing like that at all. There are a few funny parts in this but I have to say this was one of the most depressing movies that I have seen in awhile. The main reason for the depression is the little girl. I don't know if they meant to do what they did or not but you end up feeling so bad for her that that is the only thing you can focus on and the comedy gets lost. When you watch this you will see what I mean. I think the movie could have been funny and I did smile a few times but the little girl became the main focus point for me and I found it hard to like anyone in the movie except for her and Liv Tyler. Overall, a movie that is pretty good and worth checking out but if this is a comedy it's the most depressing comedy I have ever seen. I give it a B-.",1411862400,6,1403,4.032258064516129

6516657,3,B00LYHXHUI,"The film seems to be based on the game Asteroids as the main function of our 1976 Space Station is to avoid asteroids. In this film, the music and style is that of the 70's including the use of VHS tapes and Viewmasters. LTCMDR Jessica Marlow (Liv Tyler) boards the space station and works with Captain Glenn (Patrick Wilson). There is a diverse crew with families as their lives are a bad soap opera. The plot really goes nowhere as they created this metaphor and just couldn't do anything with it. Liv Tyler tells us the metaphor in the beginning that asteroids know their place in the universe and individuals who change have trouble finding their place with the trick is avoiding collisions. The characters are all shallow, perhaps by design.

Before Star Wars (which I love) much of our ""entertainment"" consisted of films and shows that were just about PEOPLE - their relationships, emotions, tribulations, etc. - not about explosions.
