8417859,5,B00478WP5E,I purchased this DVD after looking online for some safe exercises during pregnancy and this was on of the highest rated DVD's. Buying through amazon was definitely the cheapest option. I would recommend this product to any pregnant women looking for non strenuous exercises. I wish this was available on itunes or through amazon prime to download as I don't have a DVD player and had to play on my laptop which was a little annoying.,1460505600,,433,4.7105263157894735
8417860,4,B00478WP5E,Good for all phases of pregnancy! I think the warm-up is a bit long and if you want to do the warm-up/cool down and a couple of the workout options you need to set aside at least an hour.,1397606400,,187,3.8205128205128207
