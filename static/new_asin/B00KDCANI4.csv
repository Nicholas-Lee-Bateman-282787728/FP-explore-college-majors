8657802,5,B00KDCANI4,"I bought this just for the 3 Amorphis songs because I had seen Amorphis full-length hour special show on youtube and it was one of the best concerts I ever saw - but of course it has a lot of really good stuff and alot of bands,some I had never heard of and alot of familiar acts - this is really great for metal lovers because theres not alot of metal on blu-ray,it was definitely worth the purchase",1421539200,,400,4.141025641025641

8657805,5,B00KDCANI4,"I have been to this festival and always buy the DVDs.  It's a great collection of bands from the festival and give you a feel for the festival. It is packed with 3 DVD full of live shows.  I was not able to go to Wacken 2013 but watching this DVD brings back memories. Some great bands and some European bands you may not know in the USA like Mustach from Sweden, worth checking out. You get your money's worth in my opinion with the DVD or Blu Ray. This is the first Wacken Blu Ray I bought other years I bought the DVD first thing I noticed was the excellent sound from the Blu Ray better than being there.",1410652800,2,608,4.058333333333334
