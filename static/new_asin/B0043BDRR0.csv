They are tired of pat answers to complicated questions so I regularly refer them to RYF videos, where they can hear others wrestle with the same concerns.  The videos provide a great jumping off point for sponteoneous one on one or group conversations, between friends, or couples, as well as being a great resource for structured small groups or mentoring relationships. I especially love that RYF encourages ongoing  cooperative and respectful dialogue, inviting us to approach issues as a learners and fellow travellers rather than those who must know or convince others of our perspectives.  Thank you for this great series!",1295308800,,781,5.125984251968504
8414540,5,B0043BDRR0,"I have been searching for something to share with various small life groups I am involved with and I really hit the jackpot here.  No fluff or filler or endless chatter that lets your mind trail off, you will be glued to the interviews and have lots to talk about afterwards.  Raw emotions and real dialogue is what you become a part of.  My husband and I watched this together for the first time and even though we both pretty much know how the other feels about faith topics this got us talking for hours!  You will want to share this with everyone not just your church group.",1291334400,,578,4.324074074074074
