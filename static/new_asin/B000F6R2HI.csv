8117990,5,B000F6R2HI,"Andrea has the talent and personality to reach the most important consumer group: wine buyers who don't know enough about wine to truly appriciate the complexity and sensuality of wine. The tempo of the video is excellent, she says enough but not too much about each topic. This video and all of Andrea's contribution to the wine industry is of high value!
I bought this video for my friends and costumers to save my breath... Instead me telling them about this divine beverage, I let her do that, she is much prettier anyway! :)",1386115200,,529,4.638297872340425
8117991,5,B000F6R2HI,"This video is a great introduction for wine novices, as well as a fun review for wine aficionados.  Andrea's professional yet unpretentious approach provides an experience worth watching over and over again.  She takes you through the fundamentals of identifying and tasting the 'big six' grapes and then guides you through some 'deep dive' sessions to help you understand the characteristics of specific varietals and wine styles.  Extras include tips about how to buy, store, order and open wine, and also helpful hints for planning your visit to wine country.  Cheers!",1383004800,,571,5.241758241758242
8117992,4,B000F6R2HI,"I have a wine snob friend who made a snooty remark about my wine glasses, so I did what I do and Googled wine glass, just to see what I was doing wrong.  In comes Andres's The One and web site, I fell in love with her down to earth wine tasting and thought I'd get the DVD instead of joining her web site.  I liked the DVD, but it's old, I know for a fact one of the wines she shows in the video is no longer made, you can't go on line and print off her list any more either.  The bottom line is to find something YOU like and really do you have to spend $$$ on trying all those other wines when you know you hate Syrah's?  Do people have wine tasting parties any more?  I find her entertaining, the video nicely done and informative, but watched  it once and haven't watched it again or bought even one bottle of wine.",1371945600,4,819,3.933333333333333
8117993,5,B000F6R2HI,Andrea has a clear style of presenting what some find as the mysterious world of wine appreciation.  This dvd includes information that she shares in her book but adds even more.  If you want to learn how to pair wine with food she has another fine book that addresses that. Everyone can learn and enjoy with Andrea.  This dvd is a gem!,1313366400,,336,4.387096774193548
8117994,5,B000F6R2HI,"I have read Andrea's 'pocket guide' to wine in the past. She has the gift of distilling a vast amount of information into understandable and practical tips. For those of us who find watching a preferred method of learning, you can't beat this dvd for building a solid foundation for wine tasting, buying, enjoying. Highly recommended for beginners and seasoned wine enthusiasts alike.",1306886400,5,384,5.111111111111111
8117995,5,B000F6R2HI,"Andrea (Immer) Robinson is a true goddess of wine.  She is a Certified Master Sommelier with at least two books under her belt.  More importantly she has a very professional video presence.  Add the fact that the production quality is top notch and the result is a very informative and engaging presentation.

Andrea spends a lot of time going over and tasting what she calls the big six grapes.  These are Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, & Chardonnay for whites. Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are lumped together,and Shiraz/Syrah for reds.  In the tasting section, She selects several bottles from all over the world to show how each grape type can take on a very different feel and style depending on where the grapes are grown and to a lesser degree, how the wines are made.  She also spends a great deal of time talking about and displaying the various scents, aromas, and flavors that show both the similarities and differences in the wines.

While she never physically leaves California wine country, she does discuss and taste wines from all over the world.  Andrea also enlists some big name wine gurus like long time Berringer wine maker Ed Sbragia to get their views on the wines being tasted.

This video is targeted toward those with a little wine knowledge that have been bitten by the wine bug and want to learn more.  There is also something for those with a more intermediate level of wine education, especially in the sensory realm. This is a very informative, well written, and well made DVD.

This is the best all around wine video that I have seen.",1218931200,11,1575,4.728937728937729
