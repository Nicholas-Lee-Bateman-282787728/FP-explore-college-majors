8535543,5,B00944KGY8,This CD set was developed for training therapists.  It was funded by the Andrew Kukes Foundation For Social Anxiety.  Therapists can get 10 CE hours for their continuing equation requirements for licenses.  I wouldn't recommend this for clients as there is no attempt to provide therapy in this CD set.  Jonathan Berent comes at Social Anxiety Disorder from the unique perspective one gets from working mainly with that population for 30 years.  He has strong opinions and does not conform to the standard 'evidence based' mantra.  That means you won't hear much about CBT and exposure therapy in this training video.  Jonathan clearly believes that core work is essential for progress with SAD.  So if you want learn about core work for SAD this is for you.,1391558400,,758,4.913385826771654
8535544,1,B00944KGY8,"I have only watched 1/2 of this resource but I could no longer continue as it was painful to watch. There are some fatal flaws in this body of work that overshadow any possible useful or helpful ideas. The author comes across as blaming and judgemental towards a population who are most afraid of blame and criticism! This is extremely unsettling and has an element of manipulation. He appears to have this attitude even toward the young man who took his own life because of his immense suffering due to his social anxiety (among other problems). This was disturbing. The interviews with some of his participants are very problematic as well. There is one interview where the participant appears to still be struggling with a great deal of self-loathing which seemed to be overlooked (giving him the benefit of the doubt) by the clinician. There is also a gross underappreciation of the role of trauma in this disorder and also some misuse/misunderstanding of clinical terms. The best part of this work is the attention it brings to an underserved and often misunderstood population. However, the gross lack of compassion overshadows the possible useful components of the program. If you are a social anxiety sufferer, I do not recommend this resource. If you are a clinician, and can stomach the blaming and lack of compassion, then there may be some useful ideas that are worth the trouble.",1391558400,4,1392,4.9025423728813555
