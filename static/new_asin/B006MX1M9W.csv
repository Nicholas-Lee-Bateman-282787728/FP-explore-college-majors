I bought this for my husband as a Valentines Day gift not knowing what he would say, there are so many ""bad"" dirt bike documentaries out there.  Well, I can honestly say we enjoyed an evening of all four of the Kickstart series.  It features many of the riders that are still riding today, great footage, and funny interviews!  Definitely worth watching!",1395100800,,460,4.784810126582278
