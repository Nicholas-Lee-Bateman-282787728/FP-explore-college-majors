660405,4,6303477135,"According to this film the Mormon Church once had a group of men called the Danites who were assigned the duty to protect the church and its members from the many people who disliked the church to the extent that they assassinated the founder Joseph Smith. Brigham Young became the prophet after his death and moved his followers to Utah. The Danites were disbanded.
In this film there is a conspiracy to kill the prophet. Tom Berenger, who had been a Danite, is determined to find out who is behind the conspiracy and when the conspirators will try to assassinate the prophet. He kills one assassin, but others escape, and for some undisclosed reason, he is not told who he killed.
Meanwhile he is having an affair with the prophets daughter and with the wife of one of the Mormon leaders.
The film will probably annoy some Mormons. Its acting is fair, but there is lots of suspense.",1451347200,,884,4.60126582278481

I had to love the casting of Charlton Heston (who played the prophet Moses in the 1956 film ""The Ten Commandments"" as Mormon prophet Brigham Young.  And I always enjoy Tom Berenger; another plus was the casting of James Coburn as the defender of the faithful Porter Rockwell.

660631,4,6303477135,"Tom Berenger was a Mormon. It seemed to me he was what I would call a layman. There was politics among other Laymen. There was violence hanging around the Mormon community, with Tom Berenger being targeted. There was also romance displayed.

660701,4,6303477135,"This was an entertaining film concerning the people of the Mormon Church. It was mostly about there tactics used for their survival.  It mainly concerns the training of the""Danites"" who were deadly sharpshooters/snipers.  It was their job to protect the leader of the faith from assassination.  Berenger is one of those elite Danites whose job it is to serve and to protect. The old credo, One Bullet, One Kill, may have come about from this.  Berenger wreaks havoc on those who trespass .

This movie which was made for TNT and was enjoyable, provided some history lessons, and had received some awards.",1392336000,,604,4.882352941176471

Berengers portrait of Miles and his dedication to the profit I think was outstanding. I believe some of the content has some historical  fact to it and a lot of hollywood liberty taken with the characters .  An entertaining move non the less.",1386460800,,371,4.426470588235294

660805,5,6303477135,Tom Berenger is an excellent actor in this movie. Some don't realize that the Mormon Church had what was called Avenging Angels these men protected the church and its people by murdering and killing those who were against the church. This is a very good movie about that very theme. It deals with the protection of Brigham Young how much is true I don't know but it does make a good story. Porter Rockwell was a trapper and also an Avenging Angel. Early on in History after the Mormons moved to the Salt Lake area the angels were assembled to keep the US army at bay which they did for several years. If you can read between the lines you will enjoy this movie. There have been other movies called the Avenging Angel but this is the only one I know of that semi actually follows History. If you choose to get this movie you won't be sorry Enjoy.,1385164800,2,845,4.320754716981132
660806,5,6303477135,"This took some time before it was released on DVD. The wait was worth it however! Even has Charlton Heston in it! this deals with a group called the 'Danites', part of the Mormon church apparently, and Tom Berenger plays the part of an Avenging Angel' Very entertaining indeed as a western with a bit of a difference.",1385164800,,317,4.482758620689655

660808,5,6303477135,I have been waiting years to find this on DVD...my VHS tape was wearing out! A fien historical fiction told in human terms about a often challenging setting,1378684800,,156,4.607142857142857

660877,3,6303477135,"WOW is as good as GONE WITH THE WIND. I DON'T THINK SO. anyone who would say something like that, would also say that HOWARD THE DUCK is better than any WARNER BROS CARTOON OR DISNEYS CLASSICS. I would say this movie is very Entertaining as long as you look at it as ENTERTAINMENT. and not as a fractural historical movie. If you read the history of YOUNG you will notice a BIG difference between HESTON and the movie. He is no where near the REAL IRON FISTED LEADER OF THE L.D.S. CHURCH. But on the other hand the dialog is fast and the lighting is excellent. but do not get caught up in the twisted facts. for that read the real HISTORY. AFTER ALL MOVIES ARE FOR ENTERTAINMENT.

660878,5,6303477135,"I watched this (and taped it) when it was first broadcast on TNT (boy, they used to make great movies . . . why don't they anymore?).  Over the years, we watched it over and over again, and never got tired of it.  The tape finally gave out a few years ago, and we thought it was gone forever.  But now Amazon makes DVDs of it on demand.  THANK YOU!!! By the way . . . it's a great movie.  Tom Berenger & James Coburn chew the scenery, and Charleton Heston is perfect as Brigham Young.  Weakest part of the movie is Kevin Tighe (yes, Roy DeSoto of Emergency!), whose overacting as the villain is the only thing that detracts from the film.",1370476800,3,638,4.146341463414634
660879,5,6303477135,I watched The Avenging Angel when it was on TV and taped it. I watched it many times over the years and then have searched for it on DVD for several years now and was so happy to finally find it on DVD. Tom Berenger was great as the protector of Brigham Young in this movie. There was so much action in it that it keeps you interested all the way through. The quality of the DVD is great since it came from a TV movie. I would recommend this move to anyone that loves movies with Tom Berenger and Charlton Heston(playing Brigham Young).,1369526400,9,536,4.163461538461538

Still, it was entertaining and in the end, that is all that matters.",1364774400,2,365,4.338235294117647
660971,5,6303477135,"While this movie is written as fictional, it has so much historical accuracies that except for a few of the names being made up, this could easily be categorized as Historical and factual. Tom Berenger is OUTSTANDING as Miles Utley, the Avenging Angel. James Coburn was also up to the task in what was one of his last films. He portrayed the TRUE to life Avenging Angel, Porter Rockwell. Violence in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints' early history is all too often overlooked or ignored completely in our history books. But, the Mormons(a nickname placed upon the members of the LDS Church) were treated horribly for the first 25 years after their founding. Porter Rockwell was one of the few people of any faith or persuasion that could and did give his all to protect the Members of his Faith. Berenger portrays an apprentice of Rockwell's but in reality, the movie is really about the Young Orin Porter Rockwell, the original and most love and feared Avenging Angel. I can not recommend this movie highly enough. I waited for a decade and a bit to finally see this movie come out on DVD. The quality of the movie is well done, it's transfer from VHS to DVD is outstanding and were it possible, I would buy this movie by the hundreds just to give away to my friends and family.

This Movie is NOT and expose of Latter Day Saints or the Church, it is NOT an attack piece, it is NOT a movie that pokes and jabs at the Faith of the Members of the Church, Church Leadership nor was it done to make light of a serious part of our Nation's history. The early days of the Church as has been portrayed only a few times throughout celluloid history was a very violent and deadly (to it's members) and extremely turbulent time. This movie could have easily rivaled Gone with the Wind had it been more thorough and revealing about the NEED for the likes of Miles Utley, Porter Rockwell, Brigham Young and others. It could easily have been a 4, 5, or 6 hour movie event and even at 6 hours, it would still come up short in exposing the terrible treatment of the early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Murders, rapes, pillaging/plundering, theft of entire cities by the ""Wolves"" and sadly much of it was done under the auspices of the still fledgling United States Government. Even sitting Presidents turned a blind eye to the plight of the early Saints. A sitting Governor of the State of Missouri issued and extermination order upon the Latter Day Saints and still the United States Government ignored their pleas for help and redress. Thus the need for the Avenging Angels. They were not always in the right and they made some horrific mistakes at times and this Movie touches on those events. Give this Movie 10 full stars for the acting of the major stars, ten full stars for the content and historical accuracies portrayed throughout the movie.",1364688000,42,2881,4.551059730250482

To prove my point, all one has to do is to look at the plight of the American Indian. But I digress, the movie Avenging Angel, is a well done movie. The stars do a great job of portraying characters of immense importance to American history.

The movie is full of excitement and adventure. It tells of a people being persecuted and harmed relentlessly because of their religion.

The Avenging Angel is historically accurate in that, it shows the cowardice of some of the leaders within the early LDS church. There were indeed threats and acts of brutality perpetrated against the church members and their sympathizers.

The Avenging Angel was a Protge  of Porter Rockwell in the movie but, the character that Tom Beringer plays was built around the real Porter Rockwell. The Avenging Angel was actually called the Destroying Angel and it was Rockwell.

The Danites did exist within the Church but Joseph Smith demanded they cease and desist their vigilante practices. However, there was a group of men who secretly carried out defensive actions from time to time.

So all in all the movie was indeed historically accurate. Sure, some of the characters were totally fictional or perhaps it was a case of, ""the names were changed to protect the innocent"". Even the character in the movie that plotted to kill the Prophet was real, just his name was changed because there was never any direct proof that he was involved. He was murdered/killed vengefully and Brigham had him buried without pursuing his killer(s).

I would recommend this movie to anyone who was looking for a good western styled movie. I bought it new and have since wished many times that it would soon come to DVD.

Update: Amazon listened and has developed a way for us to get movies like the Avenging Angel and Miracle in the Wilderness. I just placed an order for both of the movies mentioned and can't wait until they arrive so that I can once again view these wonderful movies and share them with friends and family.",1276214400,,2152,4.750670241286863

661050,5,6303477135,"The story begins in 1872, and as the movie unfurls, we are given a scene in the Tabernacle where the first assasination attempt on the Prophet Brigham Young is attempted.  This part is fiction just like the lead character Miles Utley.  However, the movie's fiction does not minimize the interesting insight it give into a pioneer culture of survivors who braved all odds to create a Zion in the Rockies.  As entertainment, this movie will surprise you with twists and turns.  and there's a bonus; Brigham Young is portrayed excellently by the late and great Charlton Heston, and he puts on a performance that is first-rate.  I enjoyed the movie immensely and so will all who watch it.  Avening Angel looks at life in the late 19th Century as lived by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the harsh climate of Utah where they made the desert bloom for posterity.
I'm glad the Mormons succeeded, and this movie is terrific even if it is layered with fiction.",1242950400,,970,4.676470588235294
661051,5,6303477135,"tom berenger brings great strenth to this role and this film about a little known sect of the morman faith, the danites,or avenging angels,as they were called. these men were recruited and trained as bodyguards for brigham young and as protecters of the mormans against the pursecuters of their faith.

  as miles utley,berenger is great and really draws you into the plot. iseems that to some mr. utley does his job to well and they want him banished,as this is going on he discovers a plot to kill brigham young(played flawlessly by screen great charlton heston)and sets out to stop it. along for the ride is james coburn as utley's friend and mentor! the whole thing is great western fun and action packed! so sit back and enjoy this fun and exciteing movie!",1151280000,3,761,4.706766917293233

661054,5,6303477135,"A movie trailer for THE AVENGING ANGEL claims that what the viewer will see is the ""true"" story of the Avenging Angel, in this case played by Tom Berenger. Let's face it folks, if this is a ""true"" story from the American West based on historical facts then we need to all go searching for the grave sites of Shane, Conagher and J.B. Books!

True? Not nearly! Or as Brigham Young, himself, would have said, ""As false as the hinges of Hell!"" There was no Elder Rigby. Even if this character is supposedly based on Sidney Rigdon the story falls considerably short. Rigdon was nowhere near Utah at any time in his life having left the Church even before its historic days in Nauvoo, Illinois.

So, let's see. No Brother Parker, either. No Brother Pike. No gun-packing scorned former wife of Brigham Young coming back from the East with assassins in tow. No Alpheus Young, the fabricated son of the fabricated  gun-slinging ex-wife, with murderous intentions against a loving though supposedly negligent father. No Amanda Young. And, despite what some might claim, no Brother Utley either.

But wait, as a western I loved it. Yes, I give it five stars for entertainment value. Berenger is fabulous as the gunfighting avenger who's faster than the devil himself and Charlton Heston portrays Brother Brigham wonderfully. James Coburn brings a smile in his portrayal of Porter Rockwell, the historical Mormon ""outlaw"" who is supposed to have killed more men than John Wesley Hardin.  A marvelous western--though patently fictitious.

And don't watch it hoping to look into the cold, dark, historical secrets of Mormon Danism.  Want a more accurate film about the Latter-day Saints and their early history? Pass on this one. Try ""Brigham Young"" with Dean Jagger.

661055,5,6303477135,Avenging Angel is based on a book written by Gary L. Stewart about the life of his Great-Grandfather Gabriel Marion Utley. The movie is both fact and fiction. But well worth watching. The movie's discription of Miles' life and the real life of Gabriel's life are very similar.,1074470400,11,276,4.770833333333333
661056,5,6303477135,I had seen this movie before and tried finding it for my collection. It's an excellent movie and one that I will watch many times more. I hope you give it a chance...it is a learning experience as well. Thank You Amazon.com for being here for a lot of movie buffs and the casual viewer.,1065398400,4,286,4.218181818181818
661057,5,6303477135,"This movie, along with ""Rough Riders"", is another fine example of Tom Berenger's (& TNT's) talent for taking a historical setting, fictionalizing it (in a realistic way), putting in some subtle social/political commentary (disguised in a historical setting, kind of like the way science-fiction writers do it), & adding entertaining elements (in this case, rousing action sequences & romance to boot!) to make a story that both entertains & educates at the same time.
Most people who wouldn't be able to sit through a history class would, at the same time, enjoy movies like this.  (I'm a history buff, but my friends aren't.  However, when I had them over for a ""movie-night"" get together at my house, they really got into the conspiracy murder plot & they loved the action sequences & love story, as well as seeing Coburn & Heston in their roles as real-life historical figures.)
Berenger, as producer & star, knows how to choose a thoughtful subject for a film.  This movie, in a historical context, is really about religious faith & the different levels of belief.  His character, Miles Utley, is devoted to the Mormon church, which is both his strength AND his weakness, since he kills an innocent man at the beginning, in the name of God.  As the film progresses, he uncovers a plot to murder Brigham Young (Charlton Heston, the former ""Moses"" from ""The Ten Commandments!"") by subordinates who wish to take over the church, in order to ""save"" it, according to their own beliefs & purposes.
With today's events & headlines concerning both ""The War on Terror"" & the Catholic Church abuse scandals (and cover up), this movie's theme is especially poignant today.
Historical dramas serve the same purpose as science-fiction stories.  They make the audience think about current issues without preaching.  The best ones also manage to entertain the audience in the process.  ""Avenging Angel"" succeeds on all counts.  It's a western, a mystery, a thriller, a love story, & an action-drama all rolled into one!  It's ""a thinking man's"" action movie.
Besides purchasing this movie, I also suggest checking out the previously mentioned ""Rough Riders"", as well as ""Buffalo Soldiers"", ""The Broken Chain"", ""Geronimo"", ""Wallace"", & ""Andersonville"" (all from TNT), ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" & ""In Pursuit of Honor"" (both from HBO), as well as ""Son of The Morning Star"" (aired on ABC during it's initial run.)  All of these shows prove that tv isn't just ""mindless entertainment"", as some pompous critics have claimed.
History isn't about dates & cold facts (the way most history classes are taught in high-school.)  I agree with most people, in that history taught in that manner is boring!  History is about people & the human condition.  That's what ""Avenging Angel"" is about.",1019952000,14,2765,5.021881838074398
661058,4,6303477135,"Most of the other reviewers have gotten it right when they talked about this being a fictional story. The characters in this story though do act according to what they were known. The head of the conspiracy to kill Brigham Young is a thinly veiled Sidney Ridgon. The first women to take a shot at him was Ann E Young, Brigham's 19th wife who divorced him and wrote a famous expose on him a year before he died, Bill Hickman who was another of Brigham's Danites, who was known to drink a lot, and later turned in evidence showing Brigham's part in several killings and lastly James Young, the Prophet's favorite son who was arrested while on a mission and had to be bailed out by Daddy and also was known for his wildness. The story itself is fictional, Sidney never made any attempts on Brighams life, but did try to take control of the Church shortly after Joseph Smiths death. The main character is also fictional. You can tell that the screenwriter has done a lot of research into Mormonism before writing this because you see a lot of little details added like people shaking hands doing the First Token of the Aaronic Priesthood. This isn't a great film say like Lonesome Dove, but it is interesting.",1009497600,9,1205,4.532110091743119
