8098580,2,B000CEV3BY,"Peter Gardos' ""The Last Blues (Az Utolso Blues)"" is a self-discovery road picture about a man caught in the cross-roads of his life. As is usually in these type of movies, during the course of the day he will come to term with who he is. He will realize the person he has become and the views others hold of him.

 Normally I love these kind of movies. Going back to Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" or ""The Browning Version"" I find universal truths in these films in which we can all relate to. Who among us does not have a regret? Who is not plagued by the ever popular ""what if""?

 But somehow ""The Last Blues"" does not live up to what could have been. We don't come to know the main character well enough. We don't fully understand his motives and needs. Who is he really? He is as much a mystery to us as he is to himself. And while on the surface that my sound interesting, cinematically, Gardos doesn't go about it in the right visual terms to make it interesting. There are simply too many lose ends hanging around this character.

 The film revolves around Andris (Janos Kulka) a successful pastry shop owner, living in Budapest with a wife, Judith (Andrea Fullajtar) and a son. But unknown to all, except his best friend and business partner,, Zoli (Peter Rudolf), Andris is leading a double life. For over a year he has been seeing another woman, Bea (Agnieszka Wagner), who is about to have his baby. And, to make things more complicated, Andris has agreed to marry the woman.

 Bea is not Hungarian, she is Polish. She lives in Crakow, where Andris tells Judith he goes for ""business trips"". And on this particular day Andris has not only agreed to meet Judith there for a romantic evening but it is also the day of his wedding to Bea.

 How is Andris going to get out of this? What can he possibly do? Well as fate would have it, Andris, never has to confront either woman. While on the road Andris' car won't stop. The brakes stop working and he has no way of stoping the car. Even when he takes his foot off the gas, the cars remains at a steady 30mph. Andris finally decides to keep driving the car until it runs out of gas.

 Ultimately I think this is the film's big metaphor. And man on the road unable to stop, simply waiting to runout of gas. You could argue Andris is a man who is the same thing. He is simply coasting through life. Living in two seperate worlds until everything simply catches up to him. And at this point what can he do. After leading this sort of lifestyle it was only a matter of time until he too would run out of gas. But is that enough for a movie? To simply get by on a single metaphor?

 Yes, we learn some things about Andris' life. He is not in daily contact with his family. His father died. And while his father was alive, his wife cheated on him with his brother. Needless to say, Andris holds a bit of a grudge towards his uncle (Gabor Agardi), who may or may not be his father, and is the reason for his isolation from his family.

 But still I felt isolated. We not only never get to know Andris, we never get to know the other people in life. It would have been interesting to know about the woman in his life in more depth. While the film has moments which work, I could never get over the lack of connection between myself and the characters on-screen.

 Gardos is a new Hungarian director. He has mostly worked on TV shows and made films directly for TV. His next film after this was ""The Porcelian Doll"". He orginally started out as a documentary filmmaker and we can see that influence here, in the way Gardos follows the character. He has talent but it is not allowed to fully show here.

 Bottom-line: A sometimes engaging self-discovery road picture ulitmately becomes flat. No real sense of who these characters are.",1190160000,,3787,4.3522727272727275

Moreover, the film does not raise any interesting issues between men and women in marriage; it only depicts the plight of a man with two women who decides to make a choice. The main character is superficial because he only thinks of women as sex objects. There is a wealth of issues of conflicts between men and women in marriage. There is also a wealth of ways of presenting romance between a man and woman. By adding humor and misunderstanding through exaggeration coupled with some culture of the countries involved, I could write a script that would be more interesting to watch in a movie than a man who spends a full 24 hours in a car reflecting on his predicament.",1140134400,,808,4.503401360544218
