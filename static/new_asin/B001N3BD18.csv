3709270,5,B001N3BD18,My son loves this movie. This is one of the movies in his current dvd rotation.  He has a tendency to get fixated on one or more particular movies at a time & watch them over and over.  This happens to be one of them!,1355356800,,217,3.8
3709271,3,B001N3BD18,"Ok, this cartoon is totally harmless but lacks any sort of educational value. I wish I had just taken it out of the library but at least that is where it is going as a donation. There's nothing wrong with it, it can be cute, but the problem is it is just that, nothing.",1324857600,,269,4.0
3709272,5,B001N3BD18,"This DVD is fantastic my 9 year old daughter and 7 year old son love this animated series.
Hell I love watching these adventures with the kids too.
Thoroughly recommended for children.......Way to go Diver Doug!",1303171200,,211,4.888888888888889
3709273,3,B001N3BD18,"My son is 4 and loves this show on T.V.  While looking for DVD's on-line, this particular one caught my attention.  ""A Whale of a Tale"" and the pictured Orca on the front gave the impression that there was an episode or more with an Orca character.  My son if very ocean friendly and is loves learning about it's many animals...of which the Orca is his favorite.  We got the DVD, put it in the player and watched all the episodes with no Orcas seen.  As much as he loved watching Olly and his adventures, he was for sure bummed out that there was no episode with the Orca as pictured and, for the most part, stated on the front.  A lttle touch of false advertising!  Bummer!",1281484800,8,674,4.25984251968504

3709275,5,B001N3BD18,"This is my favorite Dive Olly Dive video so far. I just love this little guy. He is inquisitive, caring and insightful.

With his best friends, Beth and Skid, Olly explores, learns and grows as he teaches our children valuable lessons on friendship, listening and caring for others.

Up until recently I had not known of Olly but after reviewing a few videos have quickly rated him as one of my favorite characters. Whether your child is a 2-year old or a 6-year old they will find adventure within every Olly DVD.

""Dive Olly Dive - Ship Shape Sub"" has 5 fun, exciting adventures and approximately 55 minutes of video time.

My favorite aspect of the Dive Olly Dive series of videos is that I enjoy them also. I enjoy spending time with my daughters watching cartoons but quickly lose interest if the cartoon is so geared for children that there isn't a mental stimulation for parents. I found watching Ship Shape Sub was an adventure for myself as well. Olly is a lovable character that you can clearly see is still a curious child.

I would recommend buying a few of the Dive Olly Dive series as Christmas gifts this year. With valuable lessons and insightful educational tips this is a perfect gift to give your little ones.

You will also find a lot of fun games, activities and learn more about the characters on the show.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dive-Olly-Dive-Ship-Shape-Sub/dp/B001N3BD18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dive Olly Dive: Ship Shape Sub</a>",1250380800,2,1571,5.026923076923077

8323012,5,B001N3BD18,"...if you're looking for the episode with the killer whale in it, you will need to get the DVD entitled, ""The Adventure Begins Under the Sea"", NOT this one. But this DVD still has some great episodes on it! Here is a list of them:

I Thought I Saw a Sea Serpent~
Olly accidentally breaks a piece of coral and decides whether or not he should tell about it. (This episode also has a whale shark cameo.)

Beth's Backfire~
Beth needs a tune-up but decides to do fun things instead. But when her backfiring causes a cave-in, trapping one of their friends, she finds herself with even bigger problems.

The Big Swap~
Olly and Beth decide to swap jobs with Uma, but learn that it's usually best to stick with what you know.

Cucumber Confusion~
to help Olly finish his work faster, Skid decides to take matters into his own hands. But, unbeknownst to Olly, Skid's work was a farce that ended up getting them both into trouble. Honesty for Skid and integrity for Olly are the lessons here.

Skid the Hero~
Skid will say anything be a seen as a hero but what happens when others no longer believe his stories?",1393372800,,1101,4.430693069306931
8323013,1,B001N3BD18,"My 3 year old is fascinated by whales, so I bought this for him for Christmas.  THERE IS NO WHALE IN THIS VIDEO.  There are several episodes of Dive Olly DIve! but none contain the whale on the cover, or any whale at all.  A total disappointment.",1390262400,,246,4.191489361702128
8323014,5,B001N3BD18,"My son absolutely loves this DVD (he is currently 2 years old). Every afternoon when we come home he says, ""Mommy, Dive Dive Olly? Put it in there?"" (all the while pointing to the X-box) The characters are loveable and there are lessons taught in each of the little episodes. If my son is learning something from a cartoon I am all for it.",1363219200,,339,4.3125
