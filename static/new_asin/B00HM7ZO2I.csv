8633455,5,B00HM7ZO2I,"I loved watching Mickey McGuire comedies.  It is such a simple form of entertainment, yet comes across very funny.  It you like the Our Gang shows, you will love these as well.  It just makes me feel good seeing them.  Not to mention I am a huge Mickey Rooney fan anyway.",1400112000,,271,4.254901960784314
