8346268,1,B001VG2M8K,"I rented this at my library & agree with Blackie's 7/8/2009 review.
The production value is low, but good enough lighting in a small room. It's in German & accented English in voiceover. The name of the instructor is never mentioned.
She has no fluidity, sloppy posture, ugly arm & wrist circles, etc. etc. Even in her 5 min performance dance the camera zooms in the beautiful costume so only the bra or wrist glove are in view & even replays her single leg circle, hips circles, etc. She only does very basic moves in it, even more basic then almost all beginner bellydance workout dvds. During the tutorial & performance, she always looks like she's really concentrating, never having fun or enjoyment, even looks bored/annoyed she has to dance. She looks at herself, or off to the left or the right, anywhere but the camera looking unhappy. Just looks like someone's relative in their 40s who has no dance experience, ability, or desire, to dance being forced to dance. Everything she does it just, ""Fine, here's a rib slide, UGH!""
By the way, the woman on the cover is NOT the woman teaching. The woman teaching is Caucasian, medium, curly brown hair parted severely in the middle to below the chin that just hangs limply in pink/red pants & bra top w/long sleeves. In the performance which is called ""showcase"", she's in a long, lightly beaded, light yellow see-thru w/underneath heavy, shiny gold skirt w/light blue, light green, light yellow beaded accents on the belt & bra, beaded gold wrist sleeves, and medium orange, medium green & medium blue veil.

The back of the dvd only says, ""On this DVD, one of the most experienced dancers & teachers of the oriental style introduces the viewer step by step to the most important basic elements of Belly Dance."" The most polite thing I can say to that is, that is a complete lie.
Avoid this at all costs, unless you want to learn how NOT to dance.",1290902400,3,1901,4.640949554896142

I am professional dancer in different styles for many years now and even my beginners classes at the start point do NOT have such a bad level!
I hope that no one new to Oriental Dance does see this video. It's not only a very bad instructional - it damages esteem of oriental dance!",1247011200,5,443,4.285714285714286
