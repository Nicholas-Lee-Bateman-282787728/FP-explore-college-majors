Although Deb Mukherjee was not a very popular star like his brother Joy Mukherjee, but his acting was very good, he did not seem scripted, acted with passion, but may be, luck was not by his side, despite being produced by big banner. Not a single moment in the film was boring, would highly recommend to watch this movie. Needless to say Tanuja as ever was a treat to watch. The story reminds us of the movie Sangam till the very last, but with a good twist in the end. Excepting one or two songs all songs are memorable, especially the last one 'Savera ka Suraj tumhare liye hai'.",1305763200,,692,4.2105263157894735
