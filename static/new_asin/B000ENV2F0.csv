8111669,3,B000ENV2F0,"I liked this book for beginners or Parents to use for it covers the fundamentals of tennis prep work and
how to be ready for the ball and to learn how to volley.  There are many existing styles and tweaks to how to
introduce the game, and skill sets to kids, however for the basics I find this book to be highly effective.

8111670,1,B000ENV2F0,"Unfortunately Mr. Gould is teaching tennis methods on this DVD that have been completely debunked over the past 5 years.  All the top tennis academies now teach the Oscar Wegner method of an open stance, not running with the racquet back, and moving naturally to the ball.  All professional tennis players also use the Wegner method and not the Gould method. I strongly discourage any parent from using this DVD to teach their children the modern game of tennis.",1157760000,15,462,4.8354430379746836
