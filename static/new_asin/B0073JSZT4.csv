8509280,5,B0073JSZT4,This was an excellent and well made film. The subject of the film was upfront and open and never acted as if she was doing something that would be devastating when her world was tumbling down around her. I suggest everyone see this.,1430611200,,232,4.4186046511627906

8509282,5,B0073JSZT4,"This is a phenomenal documentary. You can get it for free on Snag Films' site (internet, Roku, etc.) Hard to watch though.",1422489600,,122,4.590909090909091
8509283,5,B0073JSZT4,"Begging Naked is a film that bears its soul to the viewer. It is hard not to be invested in Elise's downward spiral as he best friend watches it unfold with her camera running. Shot over many years, the film shows the gentrification of NYC and specifically of Times Square. Simultaneously we witness Elise being squeezed out of her work and then her apartment. As Elise becomes homeless it's heartbreaking, and it really isn't what I expected when these two friends decided to embark on telling Elise's story. Watch this film! It is a view of NYC that few have ever captured, and it is the story of an unbreakable friendship.",1397692800,,625,4.63963963963964

8509285,5,B0073JSZT4,"This film is a must see for anyone who is curious about how hard life in the city really is..Especially for an artistic woman with no family support, and mental challenges..Ever since I've seen this film I've been haunted by Elise, the main character, her precious personality and the pain that has been her life will not leave my mind..In fact I'm going to Central Park to find her to offer my help..Karen Gehres is an incredible director, she handled Elise's story w/dignity, honesty and an intimacy that makes this film riveting.. I cannot recommend this enough, definitely one of the BEST documentaries I've seen in a LONG time!!! Two thumbs up!!!",1366675200,5,651,4.821428571428571
8509286,5,B0073JSZT4,"I grew up and lived half my life in NYC.  I knew many people that lived in the fringes.  Still, when I first saw Begging Naked a few years ago I was a bit shocked and quite moved by this view of a very real life of a fellow New Yorker.  This is a film about a friendship and about a stoic woman who deals with her life on her own terms in spite of substantial psychiatric baggage.  It was good news indeed when I heard that I can buy and own this film at a reasonable price so that I can watch it again and share it with the friends that have heard me carry on about it these last few years.

I first saw this film at a film festival in the Berkshires a few years ago.  It was the best film I saw at that festival that week.  Now, after hundreds of films seen since, Begging Naked is the one that my mind won't let go of.",1329177600,8,821,3.7941176470588234
8509287,5,B0073JSZT4,"Once you see this documentary, you will not forget it. It has haunted me. It's an uncompromising, heartbreaking look at how a promising, artistically gifted young woman was pulled down into mental instability and homelessness, and how there was no safety net for her. She's someone many of us New Yorkers have probably walked right by on the street or in Central Park--too often averting our eyes. If you see this film, it will change your perception of homelessness forever.",1328313600,6,475,4.95
