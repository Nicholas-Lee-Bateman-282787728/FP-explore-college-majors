7688995,4,B01CRHKJKO,"Made in Portland, Oregon with a used car budget and a whole lot of creativity, Flesh of my Flesh is a rather different sort of zombie movie. Yes, the zombies are driven to munch on tasty tasty humans, but they are neither brainless, nor slow. The low budget does show in this film, but the concept is interesting and the story moves along at a quick pace. Gorehounds may not find quite enough gore for their taste, but there are a few genuinely gross moments.",1458086400,2,459,4.411764705882353

7689002,4,B01CRHKJKO,"Crazy, super-low-budget zombie filmmaking!  Yes, you will see the limitations, but that does not impede the insane level of inventiveness going on here.  It starts out as a somewhat run-of-the-mill zombie flick, then it goes crazy.  Really wild and strange with an ending that is nothing like you usually see in a zombie movie.
The passion and love for the art iminates from this film. The filmmaker worked with pure passion, to get this made.",1458518400,3,443,4.88
7689003,5,B01CRHKJKO,"Gutsy indie movie (pun very much intended) -- truly independent, a passion project -- made by a very clever director with a wicked sense of humor, an iron stomach, and an ability to freak you the hell out.

If you like zombie movies, HP Lovecraft, or crazy original independent maverick movies, this flick is for you. A wonderful antidote to the insipid studio superhero movies and action flicks.",1458518400,3,396,4.823529411764706

7689005,5,B01CRHKJKO,"The story and concept of ""Flesh of my Flesh"" is not zombies attack humans, its zombies attack humans and about the story about the zombies, which I love. An independent low - budget film with the essence of Clive Barker's work, Night Breed, where it is about the monsters and their history and un-dead lives with a group of humans trapped in a maze of hallways and what  what they think of as their ""safe place"". Who is fighting and who will win, and who will survive in this world. It's the little gem that should sit next to your other zombie films because I have never seen this story or take on zombies and humans before.",1458345600,2,625,4.3418803418803416
7689006,5,B01CRHKJKO,"This story may follow a group of humans, but the real story is the zombies and who and what they are about and I think that sets this aside from the other zombie films and is a nicely added thing to the zombie genre. Its original low-budget with so much packed into it that you don't normally see in a low-budget film. I have never seen an audience in a theater collectively shift their bodies slowly backwards and gasp as they did in one particularly gory and yet oddly needing to keep watching, I can't stop watching, scene. Totally worth the watching of and owning of this film next to all your other zombie films. High or low budget, it makes a name for itself and a place in the zombie genre.",1458345600,3,697,4.287878787878788

7689008,4,B01CRHKJKO,"A very fun, locally made (Portland Oregon) zombie movie that has suspense, drama, well-developed characters, and great plot twists.

7689012,5,B01CRHKJKO,"Flesh of My Flesh is fantastically fun film, for anyone of the Zombie, Apocalyptic or Lovecraftian fan bases. Fun characters, and lot of good gore in those of us who also like old school Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson, Stuart Gordon and many others.

Great locations, too!",1458259200,2,266,4.782608695652174
7689013,5,B01CRHKJKO,"Flesh of My Flesh is a truly unique and interesting zombie film.  The premise revolves around a group of researchers (played by Heather Rose Walters, Gil Luna, and Tara Walker) who are entrapped at a research facility as a zombie apocalypse ensues and closes in on them.  While there is a lot of blood and guts, there is also an intellectual interplay among the characters at the facility as well as a unique and powerful social commentary between the social differences of the humans and the flesh-eating zombies.  This is all potently revealed by a shocking and disturbing ending you will not soon forget.  Flesh of My Flesh makes the most of a low-budget by the high-quality performances of the cast as well as utilizing fear-inducing footage within the facility, and eventually, the beauty of Oregon in the outdoor scenes.  This is not your typical zombie film, and that is exactly why I liked it.  This is truly a entertaining, unique and innovative spin on the genre.  It is well-worth watching!",1458259200,4,1001,4.818713450292398

These living dead aren't your dad's slow lumbering menaces, but a force to be reckoned with. And they might even know who you are! And unlike a lot of low-budget movies, it isn't set in a single room, but in a variety of locations (and lairs), plus extensive location filming with plenty of extras. They even blow up a few helicopters!  It's different enough from the usual zombie fare that's it's worth checking out.",1458172800,2,524,4.695652173913044

The ultra-low budget shows through sometimes, but is creatively and effectively compensated for. The performances are fine, some are quite good, only a few not really up to snuff - as one expects in a low budget feature with a large cast - and those examples are pretty brief.

8753950,4,B01CRHKJKO,"You will not forget this film. There are a number of scenes here that you will play back in your head for months or longer. Understand going in that this is not a high-budget Hollywood production, but what that means is that it does not have to follow ""the rules"". It means that the script and plot did not get watered down to sell to a huge audience with a very mainstream demographic. Watching this film, it becomes very obvious that there was a passion for THIS story line and THIS script. It has some of the basic ""how humans interact under pressure"", but with twists that you just don't expect.

Watch it for the story. Expect something different than any zombie-genre movie or show that you've seen before. If you like normal, mainstream and stories you've heard a million times before, then this won't be for you. The effects are a bit campy at times, but they also fit right into the quirky story and you forget to critique them with the story taking over.  This is worth watching at least once if you have some interest in the genre, and many more times if you are REALLY passionate,",1465516800,,1092,4.455

Ok, now that we have this out of the way, let me give you an authentic point of view of this film. I am someone who enjoys the horror genre and more specifically the zombie sub-category.  While I have seen many reviews that appear to be penned from the perspective of some first year NYU student speaking about how this style is a departure from the director oeuvre.  Let me be honest, the acting was wet cardboard, the character development was nil, the cinematography was, hell there wasn't any and the effects were out of the meat counter at Costco and relied upon camera filters and rancid colors to somehow add to what they believe made some sort of  grotesque enhancement.

This film, for all its ostensible hype here in reviewland was not at all what it was built up to be.  I can go for a low budget flick from time to time but what I cannot abide is being taken for two bucks by a film that truly had no redeeming qualities and even less energy.

I have seen better performances at a elementary school play. I checked out as soon as a zombie used an AT4 to shoot down a helicopter containing a ""rescue party"" of three people wearing their father's clothes (honestly the costume were 10 sizes too big).Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of intelligent zombies, Land of the Dead did it best, in my opinion, with the zombies experiencing a gradual evolution in intelligence, but a zombie shooting a helicopter down is just ridiculous. To top it off, when they land they all say ""I'm alive"" in the most apathetic way possible, with no injuries might I add! I honestly believe that all of the 4 and 5 star reviews are members of the cast or people involved with the movie, that or I just don't know a good movie when I see one (quite possible).

Bottom line, this movie is a disgrace to every zombie movie ever made. Don't buy it, don't rent it, if somebody offers you money to watch it then walk away.",1459555200,,1116,4.314285714285714
