7479125,5,B016PGEUWQ,"The Trials of Jimmy Rose.  This British television mystery/crime drama/thriller is a three-part serial made by ITV.  It was created by the noted Alan Whiting, (KINGDOM, STRIKE BACK).  It is set in the current day, in Cockney London.  In it, international Emmy winner Ray Winstone, (THE DEPARTED, SEXY BEAST), in a part that fits him so well it must have been written for him, stars as the title character, cockney career criminal Jimmy Rose. Who, at age 61, after 12 years in his latest prison stint, returns home to mixed emotions from his family. He is  a family man, so he is determined to do right this time; obey his parole officer, get a straight job, avoid his past criminal colleagues.

But Jimmy finds out that his beloved granddaughter is now a drug user and runaway.  Hes determined to do anything he can to bring her homeeven if it means getting involved with the very man who landed him in jail, loaded his sentence, got Ellie and her drug addict/dealer boyfriend in trouble. In all this, Winstone is supported by topnotch acting.  As his- mature, hurray! -wife Jackie (Amanda Redman, NEW TRICKS); son Joe (Tom Cullen, DOWNTON ABBEY). Also Paul Jesson, (ROME); Marion Bailey, (MR.TURNER), John Lynch, (THE FALL). The episodes are:

1. Jimmy returns home after his second stint in prison for armed robbery. Finds  mixed welcome. His daughter and grandson welcome him with delight, getting out the moth-eaten old Welcome Home banner; his wife and son are cold and indifferent, have moved on without him.
2. Jimmy is attacked while trying to help his grandchild, sending the aging gangster to the emergency room. Jimmy calls his brother-in-law Roy, does a runner. The former thief returns to the pizza shop where he was beaten only to see employees talking to a man from his criminal past - a man who added time to Jimmy's sentence, whom Jimmy wants out of his life for good.  Jimmy does a bit of acting out in response.
3. After taking on his granddaughter Ellie's debt, Jimmy decides that the only way to keep his family safe is to work for Tony, from his criminal past.  This he agrees to do, despite his doubts, despite feeling heartbroken over his wife Jackie's betrayal while he was in prison.  But when Tony asks him to do a single job that will cancel the entire debt, Jimmy can't be sure he'll come out of it alive.

What we have here is an intense, driving story, running approximately 2 1/3 hours, that really deserves binge-watching. Winstone gives the part everything hes got, in a, gruff, touching performance that carries the story manfully.  Its good to see Redman, an actress who radiates toughness, back in an appropriate part again, and even better to see a love story set among older people. Mind you, this production contains violence, coarse language, nudity, sexual situations: not for children or the squeamish. The box set, which I received as a review copy, consists of the three episodes, totaling approximately 143 minutes, on one disc.  It offers subtitles, for those of us not quite familiar with cockney, no extras.  An absorbing, emotional way to spend an evening.",1454630400,3,3106,4.797373358348968
7479126,5,B016PGEUWQ,"After a life of armed robbery, a paroled man faces new life trials. An aging 61 year old fresh from prison determined to go straight is played by Ray Winstone who magnifies the character with believable acting of a man in an impossible new situation. Good to see Amanda Redman (playing the convicts wife) back in a tough leading role, after leaving New Tricks (and for those liking aging actors in top crime series roles, New Tricks is a must.) It is about one mans struggle of ending a life of crime, and the terrible influence that plays out for all family members. Not pretty, many tough scenes, for older youth and adult viewing, but some good character development. 5 stars awarded, but not for warm fuzzies, just good intense story-line and good acting for unlikable roles.

SDH SUBTITLES are provided in this 3-part series. No bonus.
1==Jimmy return home to open arms from some family after serving 12 years in prison, his second sentence, but not from wife Jackie (Redman) and son Joe (Tom Cullen Downton Abbey). To regain favor he intends to remain on the straight-and-narrow high road. But what lengths will he take to save granddaughter Ellie from heroine and life in a rough crime neighborhood?
2==Jimmy gets attacked while trying to help his grandchild sending him to the ER. Running from there he ends up fact-to-face with a link to his past. Then life gets real nasty. Jimmy sets off on a crash-&-burn rampage that begins involving his entire family.
3==Working with/for drug dealers seems the only way to finally pay off his granddaughters debt and save her life. It boils down to a one-off drug job and questionable survival. An intense ending leaving viewers with a few decisions of their own. Gripping 2 1/3 hours of story that really needs to be viewed in one setting. A story of the bad side of crime that few of us encounter in real life, thankfully.",1453852800,,1872,4.7073170731707314

8737013,5,B016PGEUWQ,"Gotta love Ray Winstone in anything he does - especially this series.  He's so intense, I found myself constantly wondering what he was thinking about all the time.  And I for one, believe that Ray could really box.  He once stated in an interview that if he could go into a ring and box, why not try acting - it's bound to be easier!  I was compelled to watch this whole series and I even got my husband hooked on it too.  It's very believable and exciting to watch.",1465344000,,467,4.202247191011236

8737016,5,B016PGEUWQ,"The beginning of the first episode could not be more perfect in introducing us to the main characters and the situation:
Jimmy Rose walks out of the minimum security prison where's he's spent the last twelve years for armed robbery. He swaggers, he throws his probation papers to the ground. He's picked up by his loyal brother-in-law (who picks up the discarded papers).

Back home, in a scene without words that speaks volumes, his wife Jackie sits at her dressing table, unsmiling. She opens a little jewelry box and takes out a gold wedding band. And sets it on the table and stares at it.

Downstairs, the rest of the family hustles about getting ready for the return of the paterfamilias. This includes his young grandson, Elliot, who wants to put up a Welcome Home banner. Unfortunately, it has been in storage from previous times and has holes from the rats chewing on it.

This shows that there is some humor in ""The Trials of Jimmy Rose"", but it is rare. This is a drama about a British version of a Wise Guy. Sixty-one years old and finding that the world has changed a lot since he was last sent down. That includes what has happened to his family when he wasn't around.

This show has moments of poignancy and insights into the human heart. Jimmy Rose sometimes seems like a sad relic. Sometimes a desperate man. And always he is complicated and sometimes he surprised me with his reactions. This means the show has good writing.

""The Trials of Jimmy Rose"" originally aired in August 2015. It has three episodes that total 143 minutes of viewing, the tension racheting each time. The DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and stereo sound. There are no DVD bonus extras. English SDH subtitles are available. In the U.S. it would be rated R for some violence, coarse language, nudity and sexual situations.

The song during the opening credits was a big hit for Frank Sinatra in 1966. No credit is given for the singer, but the song and the gravely-voice are perfect for Jimmy Rose:
""That's life, that's life,
That's what other people say.
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May.
But I know I'm gonna change that tune,
When I'm riding  high back on top in June.
...
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race.""

Happy Reader",1454716800,,2412,4.465909090909091
