7970944,5,B00000JMUP,I brought this for my autistic grandson who loves trains.  He watches it over and over.  Excellent quality.  Arrived very quickly.  I would recommend this movie and vendor.,1323907200,,172,5.035714285714286
7970945,4,B00000JMUP,"The video content is great, even though there isn't a whole lot of onboard footage. The video quality is deplorable, unfortunately. Even with the video quality problem, it's still worth buying. There are a couple sound glitches but it's no big deal. By watching this video, you can pick up some great historical trivia as well. Definitely a must buy.",987552000,2,350,4.85
7970946,5,B00000JMUP,"I really like this DVD. While it doesn't have as much train footage as some enthusiasts like, it does give the same feeling you get while traveling on an Amtrak train.
I've done the western coast as well as the  eastern corridor and this DVD accurately represents what happens - you stop  off to see the various cities, towns and sights, then sit on the train for  a while and wait for the next stop.
My favourite part of the disc is  that it indexes the scenes by city so that you can go back and watch  something you're interested in. I've learned some things about Pennsylvania  that I didn't know before.
The narration is clear and the photography  above average which make this production interesting. I also like that he  gives the names of the various people that work on the trains because this  is part of what makes travel via train enjoyable.
In short, if you like  travel, trains and photography, get this DVD! It's a steal.",939600000,16,936,4.485207100591716
7970947,3,B00000JMUP,"This video does pretty well with the video scenes from the train itself,but I feel a bit too much attention given to cities along the route much alike to a travel video. The train scenes given are very nice when they  are back on subject however. For a train buff,its still a worthy purchase.",931219200,5,292,4.407407407407407
