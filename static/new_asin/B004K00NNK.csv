8432047,4,B004K00NNK,"LOVE the movies Class and Making the Grade- two of my favorite 80s flicks in one box! 80s fans with love the pure hilarious ridicilousness of these two movies. :D Decided to give Johnny be Good a chance, and it's truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in life. Not even hilariously bad- just bad! That's why I gave this disc 4 stars instead of 5.",1459814400,,352,4.1911764705882355
