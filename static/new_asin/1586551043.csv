199040,4,1586551043,"This is a great movie it's excellent in quality, and has an excellent fight scene in it. The fight is with Gina an asassin who uses shino-ipo to paralyze the victaims only to slaughter them. When he finds Kenshin he challenges him to a battle. Kenshin accepts even though he knows he can't beat him since leaving battousai the man slayer in the past, so Kenshin tries to awaken the legendary battousai that is inside of him to kill Gina.",994032000,,437,4.475
199041,4,1586551043,"This is Volume 2 of the Rurouni Kenshin Series.  This DVD is one of my favorites ( then again, all of them are my favorites ) because of the fighting sequences and introduction of new, main, characters to this series.  In addition to the great stories and artwork, we have a glimpse at the relationship between Kaoru and Kenshin.  Plus, the music selection is great.  I think the pieces they have really suits the mood of the scene.  The DVD contains 4 Episodes:  Episode 5 is a continuation of Zansa, fighter-for-hire, Story Arc in which his past is made known to Kenshin.  Episode 6-7 is the Kurogasa Story Arc in which Kenshin must come to terms with his past as a manslayer. Episode 8 is the beginning of the Oniwabanshu Story Arc.",977184000,5,735,4.5227272727272725
199042,5,1586551043,"Volume two of this stunning series is just as good as the first; as another reviewer has said, the earlier episodes are a bit more concerned with introducing the characters and developing their motivations; this said, there are still some stunning sequences that are well worth waiting for. This DVD also introduces the beginning of a very long storyline that will not be concluded until at least the end of the first season and (it seems) even beyond that.
The series is set in historical Japan but does take liberties, so it is best viewed as a work of historical fiction, or maybe even an 'alternate history' setting.
There is not much extra present on the DVD but what is present nicely complements the main feature, especially for those not already familiar with Japanese culture.
Subtitling is performed using a somewhat archaic-sounding form for Kenshin, but I feel that it is appropriate to how he behaves. The dubbed version seems to be adequate but I have not really listened to it (I am generally biased against dubs, as I have infrequently come across decent work in this area).
Finally, this is not a series that you will be able to just pick up; if you do not watch the episodes leading up to this, you will miss a great deal of the feel of the series. I strongly recommend watching this series in order; while this is not critical at this early stage, it will become more so as the series develops.",973641600,7,1413,4.611111111111111
199043,4,1586551043,"This is a long anime series, and at first it may seem to drag somewhat.  The early episodes are intended to introduce and establish the main cast of  characters, to show them at their best, to allow the viewer to come to know  them well. The stories told in episodes 1-27 (the first season) of the  series are fairly simple, though fairly well-written. It is clear at all  times that Kenshin and his friends are the ""good guys,"" and that  the people they're up against (bandits, pirates, terrorists, the like) are  the bad guys, in almost all of these episodes. There are a few exceptions,  but only a very few. It is with the second season that the story really  becomes interesting, even riveting, as the series becomes more concerned  with historical Japan. The stories become much more complex, with the lines  between good and evil blurring and becoming nonexistent. This saga, the  Kyoto Saga, is the best of Rurouni Kenshin, and the story which makes the  series worthwhile. The main reason to watch these early episodes is for  knowledge of the characters, their backgrounds, their stories, and their  motivations, by the time the Kyoto Saga comes around. If you've already  started the series, and are wondering what all the fuss is about, because  the story isn't as interesting as you've heard, you've probably heard about  the Kyoto Saga. Hang in there, it'll be worth it. In other words, the early  episodes are worth buying as a part of the series, even though they're  nothing spectacular on their own. The reason I give this 4 stars instead of  3 is simple: this is an excellent example of good translation work. If  you're considering not bothering with the pro translations, and sticking  with the fansubs, let me tell you, as someone who's watched the entire  series fansubbed, you're making a mistake. This translation gives new  quality to this series. Thank you to all those involved with the  translation; you have preserved the beauty of the language used in the  series, no easy task.",965952000,15,2009,4.798245614035087
199044,5,1586551043,"Ever since I first heard of Hitokiri Battousai... I've loved it.  This  volume contains the battle with Sano (One of my favorites) and the fight  with Jinei, 2 of the best until you get to the Kyoto chapter.  The  background music is beautiful and the fight scenes are intense.  The  subtitles are wonderfully done, though the did ""over-translate""  to simplify things.  I highly recommend this to any anime fan!",965692800,2,411,4.840579710144928

199046,5,1586551043,"I love this show so much, and if I am correct in assuming that this volume contains Kenshin's fight with Jine... these are probably the best pre-Kyoto episodes!  Kenshin's character development is great in this part, you see  both his romantic side and his Battousai side for the first time (Battousai  being, basically, his killer side... no time for lengthy translation  notes!)  These episodes definitely set the stage for the serious conflicts  Kenshin will face later... if you see nothing else this year, or decade, or  lifetime, you must see Kenshin!",957398400,4,557,5.054945054945055
199047,5,1586551043,"Kenshin is one of the best fighting anime kinda video that i've seen so far. it is nothing like that lame Dragon Ball Z. kenshin is amazing, he actually uses real-life sword technique. by the way, kenshin, is the story  about a young samurai named Kenshin who by a twist of fate ends up living  in a Dojo. then he gets in to troubles and some guys want to kill him, or  some band of samurais want to kill him to prove themselves or something  like that. the drawings are great and the plot is well thought and  sophisticated (it makes sense) yet easily followed.",957052800,2,562,4.314285714285714
199048,5,1586551043,"This DVD has episodes which meanings cannot be fully understood until seeing more of the Kenshin saga.  The battle between Sonosuke and Kenshin is very entertaining and critical to the story as this will not be the last time that they fight.  The episodes regarding Jinah and the battle in the moonlight show how Kenshin is battleing with his inner Batosai and how what he does will effect Kaoru.  It forshadows the romance that will brew between the two of them, especially the ""Protect the one you love"" title.  Kaoru is the main person bringing him back to who he is and not the murderer inside himself.  This is an excellent DVD that will keep you at the edge of your seat with its fighting and romantic atmosphere.  When first watching Kenshin on cartoon network this is the show that got me hooked and began a long binge on Rurouni Kenshin.  I highly recommend it!",1059350400,5,870,4.574193548387097
199049,5,1586551043,"Kenshin Himura, once known as The Battosai (manslayer), was a killer in service of the Japanese rebellion against the Shogunate.  In that most turbulent of times Kenshin made a name for himself as the single most deadly swordsman of the era.  Now Kenshin has turned his back on that, refusing to kill again, and, armed with a reverse-bladed sword, seeks to defend those who are oppressed or threatened.
The inner tragedy and betrayal that motivates Sanosuke Sagara (Zanza) are told for the time.  We quickly come to understand that the rakish, violent swordsman has a great deal of genuine worth.  Kenshin uses both his ability to fight and his ability to reach past barriers to find this value and turn the bitter warrior into a friend.
The next tale is the counter-story to Sanosuke's.  This time another killer in the Imperial cause has let the joy of killing and bloodshed overwhelm him.  Jinei has lost his humanity, and goes about killing politicians and public figures.  When Jinei discovers the presence of Kenshin he issues his challenge, one that endangers Kaoru and threatens to turn Kenshin back into the killer he once was.
In the final episode, a cliffhanger, we meet the beautiful Megumi.  Sought by the city's Yakuza, Megumi literally catapults herself into Kenshin's arms.  Hardly an innocent herself, Megumi maneuvers Kenshin and his friends into a deadly confrontation with the Oniwaban, a group of ninja and esoteric killers.  With spectacular results.
For all the violence that is a part of this series, they touch a deep chord.  Kenshin's fierce determination to never kill again is matched by the close bond he forms with his friends.  We see a man at peace with the arduous process of remaking himself, with little of the false pride that marks many of his fellow swordsmen.  This combination of strong characters, a good story, and excellent graphic work makes this a must series.",1058659200,4,1905,4.934169278996865
199050,5,1586551043,"Of course since Himura Kenshin is staying with Karou Kamiya at her dojo, the title of ""Rurouni Kenshin: Wandering Samurai"" is rather ironic.  Volume 2, ""Battle in the Moonlight,"" continues the creation of the core group for the popular anime series and sets the tone for things becoming much more serious.  In Episode 5, ""The Reverse-blade Sword vs. The Zambatou,"" Kenshin and Sanosuke Sagara have their big dual.  The episode title refers to their respective swords, a non-killing blade and the largest sword in Japan (a.k.a. ""the horse killer"").  We finally learn why Sanosuke hates the Imperialists and he ends up becoming the fourth member of the group.  Episode 6 ""The Appearance of Kurogas"" and Episode 7 ""Deathmatch Under the Moon"" offers a two-part confrontation between Kenshin and a shadowy samurai who is able to cloud the minds of his opponent.  Kurogas's goal is to enrage Kenshin so that he fights like the mankiller he once was and towards that goal he kidnaps Karou, who had been trying to get Kenshin to notice what is right under his nose.
Episode 8, ""A New Battle,"" is the opening chapter of a larger storyline, introducing Megumi Takani.  Descended from a long line of doctors she is now involved in an opium ring and seeks the protection of Kenshin.  We also meet Aoshi Shinomori, the former master spy and assassin, who is now the chief enforcer for the opium ring.  This ups the ante for ""Rurouni Kenshin"" in a couple of ways, not only because the subject matter is more serious, but also because Megumi seems intent on coming between Kenshin and Karou.  What makes this rather interesting is that the ""cutesy"" anime sequences, usually provoked by any notion of romance between our hero and young Karou, are really starting to seem out of place.  The strengths of this anime is that it is intent on developing a series of characters with some depth involved in stories set against the historical period of the Meiji Restoration.  Young viewers are being brought up to the next level of anime story telling and the more serious the subject matter becomes in these episodes the less appropriate we find the kiddie stuff to be.  Still, the ambitious nature of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is clear at this point, which makes it a notch above most of its competitors.
In terms of the Extras this time around the Liner Notes continue our education on Japanese language and culture as to the meaning of ""sessha,"" who the Shougital were, what constitutes a Battojutsu, and the correct usage of ore; however, be aware that these vocabulary terms are not in alphabetical order and that the writing is pretty small.  The character provided on Volume 2 are of Megumi Takani and Aoshi Shinomori, as our little group continues to expand.  There are even some faux ""Outtakes"" which show that these extras are limited by fan friendly.",1056067200,10,2831,4.820247933884297

199052,5,1586551043,"I always have been a big anime fan, and one day I just happened to be at my good friends house, and her sister brought home this DVD for us to watch.  Neither of us had ever heard of it before, but we gave it a shot.  Lucky thing that we did!  We both fell head over heels in love with this DVD, as it flawlessly combines humor, action, a great storyline, and characters you can really share some empathy with!  So if you're looking for something interesting and easy-to-follow, I greatly recommend Rurouni Kenshin.  If you have Cartoon Network, they play the series on Toonami every weekday.",1050537600,,592,4.444444444444445
199053,5,1586551043,"This DVD features episodes ('eps') 5-8, first season. They are all critical eps, insofar as they introduce important characters, and/or feature highly distinctive and entertaining stories that will be referred back to by later eps. The 8th ep introduces a character (Aoshi Shinomori) who shall be very important in later installments of the 'main' story. All eps are taken from stories of the original manga (Japanese graphic novels).
The threat level to Kenshin (& company) ramps up significantly during these four eps. The eps feature the first person whom Kenshin cannot defeat in one hit; the first enemy who actually lands his own hits (and damaging ones) on Kenshin; and the first time Kenshin is forced to go into full Battousai-mode (his eyes change color when he becomes mad enough to kill. In later eps, his clothes change color, too. |g|) Eps 6-7 also feature swordfights which take place at Kenshin's own speed level, and thus are sufficiently detailed. The 8th ep features the first serious multiple-person threat to Kenshin & Co. The DVD ends with the first of a 4-ep story arc (arguably the best of the first season), which rather annoyed me.
This DVD is the first one to feature the amusing 'outtake' vocal dubbing sequences. The outtake sequences are a typical bonus for (almost) all the DVDs from here on out.",1038787200,,1327,4.928571428571429

199055,5,1586551043,This DVD like all the other Rurouni Kenshin DVDs that I have seen it's excellent! This one is one of the best whenever the swords of two manslays cross you know your in for some of the best action and story that anime has to offer.

199056,5,1586551043,"This is the first volume where Kenshin has some serious trouble against an opponent.  The character Kurogasa is execellently portrayed by voice actor Ohtsuka Akio, depicting his violent atmosphere and joy for battle so well, that you actually start to like this character.
A new story line begins as well, presenting the Oniwaban group, and Kenshin's future opponent, Aoshi Shinomori.  Don't miss these epesoids.",1001635200,,412,5.421875
199057,5,1586551043,"This DVD contains episodes that get you psyched up, leaving you wanting more!  Viewers get a glimpse of the dangerous, cold-blooded killer concealed within Kenshin for the first time when he is forced to confront a man from his past who possesses fighting skills that can match Kenshin's.  Kenshin is once again faced with the conflict of whether to kill or be killed...
The DVD serves as an introduction to Megumi Takani and the Oniwabanshuu Ninjas.  Sanosuke becomes a new face at the Kamiya dojo and little romantic sparks between Kenshin and Kaoru appear here and there.
Personally, these episodes turned me into a Kenshin fan and I would say it is the most exciting of the DVDs which precede the Kyoto Arc.  It's a teaser leaving you wondering and wanting to know more about Kenshin as the batthousai. It's also a precurser, giving you a taste of the type of men and type of battles Kenshin will have to face the next time Kenshin's present collides with his past!",996796800,,969,4.682352941176471

7799489,5,1586551043,"Kenshin Himura was an assassin for the imperialist army during the revolution. At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

In this volume Kenshin meets his soon to be best friend, Sanosuke Sagara. He also encounters a madman, Kurogasa. Kurogasa and Sano both have duels with Kenshin. The dispute is over their dark past. The battles are intense and dramatic. This is where the action in this series begins.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative.

7799491,5,1586551043,"This volume is a great follow up to the first one, in the sense that we get to find out further details about the past of the main characters, and the story evolves nicely. Understanding why Sanosuke Sagara, the wild and aggressive Zanza, exposes a vicious hate for imperialists, was one of my goals when watching this installment. I was certainly not disappointed. The second key aspect in this volume is the previous promise by Kenshin, the Battosai, not to kill again, since he is put in a situation in which keeping this promise may result in harm for a loved one.

This series has a really nice flow to it, and I particularly like the way in which Kenshin talks, and how his short speeches slow down the pace of the fight, only to let it go forward again in warp-speed fashion. The concept of friendship is well explored, and in turn gives the characters more depth and allows for a connection to develop with the viewer. Humor is an important element in this series too, since it provides a break from the serious philosophical mood at certain points in time. As was the case in the previous volume and in the manga, the use of distorted expressions keeps showing up effectively to make us laugh.

There is a clear evolution of the story in the sense that the opponents that Kenshin and his friends face get tougher and tougher with each episode. I am looking forward to seeing what happens with a mysterious character that appears briefly during the last episode in the disc; the promise of a challenging battle to come is definitely in the air. Since the volume ends with a cliffhanger, I am also eager to find out how that situation resolves itself. Based on what I have seen so far, I am pretty sure that I have a long and satisfying road of excellent episodes ahead.",1195603200,,1777,4.515527950310559

7799493,4,1586551043,"Ruroni Kenshin: Vol. 2: Battle in the Moonlight contains four episodes, #5 - #8.  These episodes are markedly serious and violent, with sadness and betrayal.  The government of Japan during the new Meiji period is capable of horrific things.  I appreciate the lessons in this DVD.  There is also fine, memorable dialouge.  One example is from the third episode.  ""A manslayer is always one.  He can never be anything else his whole life."" The backgrounds are much easier on the eyes and more realistic.  The night skies and the full moon are painted very well.  You actually shiver when the night wind rustles the trees.  The backdrops are not overcolored with technicolor.  However, Kaoru's kimonos are too bright; the colors should be more subtle.

Episode 5: ""The Reverse-Rlade sword vs The Zanbatu"" - The young, mighty (mighty hunky, too) Sanosuke fights Kenshin over a matter of honor.  In this episode, we see the poignant memories that have driven Sano to this day.

Episode 6: ""The appearance of Kurogasa"" - This episode is part one of two.  The feared and powerful Kurogasa is an unstoppable serial killer. He is targeting politicians. The chief of police asks Kenshin's help in bringing Kurosaga down. But Kurosaga knows Kenshin very well.  Can Kenshin defeat this wicked creature without defeating himself?

Kurogasa has some wicked Shinobi tricks up his sleeve.  He would have fit in perfectly as a character in Ninja Scroll.  Kurogasa is drawn that way, acts that way, and speaks that way.

Episode 7: ""Deathmatch under the moon"" - Breathtaking conclusion to Episode 6.

Episode 8: ""A New Battle "" - A beautiful, mysterious woman asks Kenshin for help.  Megumi is not all she seems - but is Kenshin too blinded by her beauty to see?  Sano suspects the worst of ""the little fox.""  This episode has reference to drugs, namely opium.  The villians chasing the Fox are also great Ninja Scroll shinobi.  One of them however, looks too much like the Hulk to be believable.  Giving him rat teeth makes him look silly, not formidable.

This episode has a ton of laughs.  Kaoru is insanely jealous as Megumi fawns over ""Dear Kenshin.""",1112400000,,2138,4.861111111111111
