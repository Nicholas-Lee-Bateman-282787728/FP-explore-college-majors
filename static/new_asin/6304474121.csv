7871960,4,6304474121,"Great exposure for students to a classic field study in populations and ecosystems. They marvel at the long term commitment made by Ms. Goodall to her vocation. Excellent for showing not all science investigations involve labs, test tubes and explosions. I find it entertaining and educational and fresh every year when we show it.",1400889600,,331,5.148148148148148
7871961,5,6304474121,This is the show that began the Jane Goodall legacy. Her journey and then interaction with the chimpanzees is amazing.,1353196800,,118,4.95
7871962,5,6304474121,"This is not your typical wildlife movie with chilling action scenes of predators chasing down and killing prey.

Rather, it is a meticulously laid out and nicely shot film about the extraordinary pioneering work done by Jane Goodall and her life among the wild chimpanzees of Africa. You get to see different chimps up close and to almost 'live' with them through the eyes of the camera and the narrator. The film spans enough years of the chimps' lives to see how their behavior changes as they mature and get older, and as the environment around them changes.

Through it all, you get to see Jane Goodall's compassionate, yet scientifically detached, interaction with these animals. At the end of the movie, you are totally in awe of her and what she has achieved in her life.

All in all, a film totally worth buying and watching.",1153526400,,833,4.691780821917808
7871963,5,6304474121,"With the possible exception of ""The Sharks"", this is the most famous of all the National Geographic nature documentaries.
Jane Goodall has spent most of her life studying the chimpanzees, and here she shares  what she has learned over the years about the behavior of a particular  group of the primates.  Touching, heartbreaking and frightening at times,  the video's greatest moment may be when we see the chimps getting a meal of  termites with...a tool.  By the end, you'll feel as if you know many of the  chimps.  Quite an experience.",963014400,3,539,4.846153846153846
