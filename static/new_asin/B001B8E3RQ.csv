Okie dokie...where to start?

Well, the movie is basically about a viral apocalypse that has hit Taiwan & probably the world. It's wiped out the population save for 2 cute Asian gals. One is a slightly annoying (but still cute) girl named Ace & one a very quiet & spacey girl (also cute) named Yvonne. They basically wander around and talk to each other. Ace does almost all the talking btw. She also shops/steals designer stuff and has a penchant for collecting shoes. Yvonne mostly drags her feet and looks sleepy & depressed, which I suppose she is. She was traumatized by severe bullying (I can relate) before the outbreak. Oh, and she is prone to hallucinating and paranoia. Since that relates to a very important plot point, I won't say any more. I don't like spoilers.

The film is very low budget and the producers and performers worked fairly well with what they had. I do believe what they were going for was a very sparse feeling which is what it conveys. It's pale visual tone & setting makes you feel kinda lonely & depressed--like the main character Yvonne. If you're looking for action or horror this film is NOT it. There's no gore, violence, zombies, lesbian sex, lesbian zombies, etc. to be seen. It's not a horrific suspense film like the description leads you to believe. It's more like a dry arthouse(ish) flick with a virus theme. For that it's not too bad. Just be prepared if you choose to watch/buy it. Remember the word ""SPARSE."" I personally like films like this sometimes. I'm patient.

My recommendation... rent it through Amazon Instant Video. That's what I did. It's usually only about $2.99. It's definitely not worth the $22.90 for the 2 disc version they're exclusively selling here. They need to MAJORLY come down on the price tag.

Other potentially useful tidbits:
Main cast--
Yvonne played by Liaw Yan-tin who is a theatre actress.
Ace played by Yul-Chen-su who is a Taiwanese model.

This 2008 movie was filmed in Taiwan by U.S. filmmaker Thomas Ulitzka. He wrote, directed & produced.",1356480000,2,2119,4.744565217391305
