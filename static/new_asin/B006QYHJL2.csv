8503404,4,B006QYHJL2,"While I enjoyed the movie, there was an element of typical Hindi Film Industry quality to it, meaning that it was a little 'long winded'  The story, written by Salim Khan (Salman's father) was intelligent, as is his style, but there was a bit of a 'soap opera' characteristic that wasn't quite so appealing. The sound and picture quality was satisfactory. I would recommed this to any die hard fan of Salman's, simply to see how well he's developed as an actor and to enjoy the elements of that era.",1363046400,2,499,4.544444444444444
