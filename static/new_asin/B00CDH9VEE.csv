5716246,1,B00CDH9VEE,"Arc 3's story telling is somewhat plodding.  It has an almost Dragon Ball Z esque devotion to characters churning slowly with rage, transforming, and lashing out in spectacular fashion.  There's also a heavy dose of flashbacks and scenes illustrating internal conflicts rather than plot progression.  It is beautifully animated, but it is slower than the first two films.  On the other hand it is more gruesome than the first two.  If not necessarily more violent, it is more emotionally violent and full of wrath rather than valor.  It also finally unpacks the more mystical aspects of the Berserk universe.  That said, Arc 3 doesn't work that well as a stand alone film, and definitely doesn't work as the capstone to a trilogy.  If doesn't bring the story to a climax so much as introduce new conflict.  Hopefully the next film in this saga won't waste so much time, or will contain several more  hours of animation to give it a cogent arc.",1389744000,3,943,4.765432098765432
5716247,5,B00CDH9VEE,"I'm rating this already because I've watched the Japanese release. First of all, many people will complain that this does not have a satisfying ending. It's because it's the end of the Golden Age and not the end of Berserk. The creators are planning much more that will take place in the future of berserk. So think of the golden age arc as the prequels to what Berserk really is and an introduction to the characters and setting.

While I watched the Japanese version, I know that this will also have the same American cast as the first two and they do a great job. Most of the actors are fairly popular English dub actors. And even if the voice acting were an issue, the amazing animation that blends traditional anime style with CG is enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen.

As far as the story, it's really a harrowing tale. I started the Berserk trilogy expecting gruesome violence and gore, which there is plenty of, but what I found was a beautifully crafted story that shows the limits of the human spirit. It moves a little too fast because each movie covers several years of the manga. But it still keeps you up do date with most of the important events. There are also a lot of changes from the Manga that a lot of die hard fans will find displeasing but for newcomers and most returning berserk fans, it's still a great retelling of an amazing story.

It's more than worthy of five stars. I never much cared for anime before this trilogy and this alone completely converted me. My father who is almost fifty finds the idea of anime completely repulsive. After forcing him to sit and watch it, even he thought it was some of the best cinema he's ever seen. If you're even remotely a fan of Berserk, buy this movie because showing support for these films increases the amount of Berserk we get in the future ^_^",1389744000,40,1828,4.434523809523809

Now if you are like me and enjoyed the previous two Berserk movies, then I think that this one will by far be your favorite. If however, if you're part of the small minority who couldn't abide the departures from the source material, then the improved quality of the third installment won't be enough to save the franchise for you.

This movie opens some time after The Battle for Doldrey ended. Griffith is in prison having some trippy visions, clearly in bad shape. The Band of the Hawk isn't fairing much better, although they're being held together by Casca, who has taken up the mantel of leader in Griffith's absence. After some brief backstory about what's taken place since the last movie, the camp is attacked by mercenaries working for the King of Midland. Silat makes a brief but memorable appearance fighting Casca before Guts reenters. The visuals of the fight scene here were absolutely spectacular!

The scene between Casca and Guts at the waterfall is one of the most touching moments we've seen in the trilogy. The music, the visuals, and the dialogue are all beautiful. This was a pleasant change of pace from the previous installments, which kind of cut down on a lot of the character development between Casca and Guts. The sex scene was graphic, but without being pornographic. My biggest gripe here is that the love scene itself was another big departure from the way it was handled in the manga. As we know in the manga Casca is in pain at first, and then of course Guts chokes her and has that big breakdown, and it ends with her accepting his dysfunction and taking a ""wound"" to protect him (emotionally).

The Skull Knight's entrance is masterfully done, as was the Hawk's descent into the dungeon. We even get to see the Gaiseric and the branded corpses at the bottom of the pit. I was very pleasently surprised that this was included, as even the 90s anime left it out. The violin music when they find Griffith is a bit over the top, as it makes the scene seem almost satirical, but other than that the shock and horror of Guts and the rest of the Hawks is well captured.

Unfortunately, despite rumors to the contrary, Wyald is once again absent from the adaptation. This was probably my biggest disappointment with the movie, but it's hardly a deal-breaker. The reality is that there are time constraints and the studio can only include so much.

A bit more lame CGI when Casca fills everybody in on Griffith's condition, and then everything after this is a pure, sexy, awesome, roller-coaster ride to Hell. Griffith breaking down and the Behelit activating is flawless, and one of the best scenes in the entire series. Everybody being transported to the sacrificial grounds and the Godhand's intro is the best kind of spooky. It gets even creepier when Griffith starts having visions of his childhood and the corpses of all those who fell in battle for him.

Once the ""feast"" begins it's sheer horror. And the shift in colors from purple to red wonderfully accentuates the shift in tone. When the Hawks are first transported to Hell, the scene is balancing on the edge of a knife, and once the brand goes out it tips over the edge into pure chaos. More awesomeness from the Skull Knight as we see him clash with Zodd. The animation here is once again, absolutely spectacular. In fact, the animation throughout most of the Eclipse is very well done. Even the CGI is better, as it gives the Apostles a spooky, otherworldly appearance.

Finally we arrive at ""that scene."" The infamous rape scene is every bit as horrifying as it was in the manga. I had to fight back tears when Casca told Guts not to look. The only thing I will say is that it's extremely graphic, much more so than the 90s anime, and not for the light hearted. The Skull Knight's siege on the eclipse cranks the badass levels up by about 80%, and then just like that, it's over.

The shift in tone comes about as naturally as it could given the situation. We don't get to see the birth of the demon child, but if you watch after the credits you will get to see Guts suit up as the Black Swordsman.

All in all I think that this movie, as well as the rest of the Golden Age Saga, was an absolute masterpiece of animation and storytelling. It had it's problems, but there is a noticeable improvement with each installment. Aside from the cheesy CGI that pops up every once in a while, my biggest issue is with the departures from the source material. Many of them I understand, since there are time constraints, but I was very disappointed that many of the tender moments between Guts and Casca were left out. That being said, I loved the moments between the two of them in this installment. They ranged from touching, to horrifying, to absolutely heartbreaking.

The animation quality in this movie exceeds almost anything I've ever seen. In particular I have to praise the scenes with the Skull Knight, the Eclipse, the descent into the dungeon, the fight scene with Silat, and the scene with Guts and Casca on top of the waterfall. The music for the most part was fantastic, other than some inappropriate violin music during a few otherwise serious scenes that takes away from the tone. The voice acting, both English and Japanese, as very well done, almost equally so. I'm so thrilled that they were able to gather so many of the old Dub actors and actresses from the 90s.

With the English DVD/BR not released yet, I can't comment on the specifics of this set in and of itself. Once the set is released I'' update this review with the regards to the extras, this particular dubbing, and whether or not any parts of the Eclipse are censored. One comment I'll make now is that I really like the cover art. If I'm being perfectly honest, I do prefer the black Blu Ray that was released in Japan, but I do enjoy the dark and imposing tone that this one creates, that so accurately reflects the contents of the film itself.

One final note that I really want to drive home, is how important it is to buy this series if you enjoyed the movie. These days piracy is at an all time high, and nothing is hurt worse by this than American distributed anime. Since Berserk is already not as well known as other, clearly lesser quality, anime such as Naruto and Bleach, it's particularly difficult for high budget projects like this to make any headway when everybody just streams it online and doesn't bother to support the series. The manga scans of Berserk gain tens to hundreds of thousands of downloads within the first few days of being uploaded, meanwhile the volume sales are so  low that Darkhorse has stopped printing the old issues. If you love anime, and in particular if you love Berserk, please buy this series so that Miura and studio C4 are able to continue the series. It took so long for us fans to get this reboot to happen, I would hate for the opportunity to be squandered.",1389398400,104,6912,4.581715210355987
5716249,5,B00CDH9VEE,"Before I say anything else, it's important to note that this DVD contains no English subtitles or voice acting. This is strictly Japanese only.

Comes with three discs. The first is the R18 version of the film, the second is the censored version, and the third is special features. Contrary to rumors, the censored version does not have additional content. The reason that the censored version has a longer run-time is due to the music video at the end. Most of the other differences are during the eclipse, some of the gore is censored, and there are shadows covering Casca and Femto during the rape. Better special features than the BRs that Viz has released so far. Some commentary from the creators and behind the scenes stuff. The cardboard cover is hand drawn by Kentaro Miura himself, and features an alternate version of the Berserk Volume 12 manga cover. My one complaint is that the R18 version doesn't support surround sound, which is a shame because I really enjoy watching these movies on the big screen with full speaker use.

Regarding the film itself, all that I can say is WOW! It's mind blowing. Easily the best of the Golden Age trilogy so far. Possibly the most graphic anime I've ever seen. The infamous rape scene is horrifying and heartbreaking and grotesque all at the same time. The demon massacre is every bit as horrific as the manga. This is the Eclipse that Berserk fans have been waiting for, not to mention that we finally get to see the Skull Knight animated. Speaking of SK, he easily stole the show here. They managed to capture that mix of creepiness, mystique, and heroism that makes his character so cool in the manga. My favorite scene in the entire movie is the one where Griffith breaks down and the behleit activates. You can feel his complete and utter despair when he tries to kill himself in the lake. Among the other notable scenes I feel the need to express praise for the Zodd/Skull Knight fight, the Godhand intros, Griffith's mental collapse within the Eclipse itself, the Skull Knight's attack on the ceremony, Gaiseric, and Silat.

All in all great movie. The biggest criticism I have for the content itself is where they ended it. In my opinion, it would have been better to extend the movie by 10-15 minutes, and show the birth of the demon child. Instead, it ends with Guts fighting off spirits with the Skull Knight, then skips to him departing as the Black Swordsman after the credits. I will be VERY disappointed of they skip the demon birth and Guts' first apostle kill and move on to the Black Swordsman arc.",1382745600,10,2567,4.662251655629139
5716250,1,B00CDH9VEE,"Oh this trilogy... where do I even start first?

Berserk is easily my all time favorite manga; there's not even a close
second. It's one of the most well-polished, written, executed epic
tales ever published.
The Characterization and story are near flawless and that's what
gravitated it as my all time favorite manga.

Naturally, many others share my love of it, and because of the incompleteness of the first anime series, naturally, now that manga is, I want to say, wrapping up, it seemed only logical to do a fresh new adaptation so maybe its fanbase can at last see the entire thing fully animated. Sounded like a good notion to everyone; until we saw the movies, that is.

I know almost everyone's first criticism was, of course, the animation. Budget saving CG; it looked awkward, yes, but, animation isn't everything, so, I was still excited to see them and check it out. Though, what bothered me was their genre choice for adaptation. Film... probably the worst medium to hope to adapt a complicated story, due to the numerous time restraints. And even just 3... there's no way that can cover 12+ volumes of manga; that took 25 episodes of anime. And... it turned out, I was right. Three was never enough; MAYBE 4 could have worked; but what we got was hardly what I'd call ""Adapting the full story"".

The first movie was obviously the one they cared the least about. Content wise, it was abridged quite badly. But, ironically, towards the end of it, I actually found myself really liking how they handed the Zodd battle and Guts' murder of Adonis and Count Julius. I was getting excited that ""Yeah, the first one is always the more butchered, but at least they captured the feel. I can't wait for the second one.""

The second one was hyped up like ""Yes, finally, it's going to be a little slower paced."" And... this is where the real hatred of this trilogy began. It was far worse than the first one to me; and hands down my least favorite of all 3. The animation seemed to just be getting worse, which distracts from the story, and they cut so, so much. I didn't even get to witness Guts and Casca's relationship begin to improve; it just sporadically happened, with the only explanation literally being ""Oh, they worked together when they got isolated."" And yes, that was part of it, but, there were a lot more factors than just that. But in the films, that's literally all we got. So, when she was upset to see Guts leave, I didn't buy it. Didn't help that none of the Hawks were elaborated on, so, I really felt nothing whatsoever when Guts chose to dramatically leave.
It was pretty obvious to me, everyone working on the movie only wanted to do the sex scene between Griffith and Charlotte, because, that was pretty much the longest, most pointless scene in the entire movie; yes, it's just like the manga, but, without any of the backstory that lead up to it; it was just gratuitous.

And, finally, we come to this one. I'll admit too, when I saw the trailers, I was like ""WOW... I can't WAIT to see this!"" The animation looked pretty good this time around, loved how they showed the Eclipse's atmosphere; it looked like there might be Wyald (Guts' missing armor), and the aftermath. Yes, this was going to be the GOOD one! Everyone thought so, and obviously the one everyone behind the scenes wanted to do most of all too. Even after it had come out in Japan, I was seeing reviews akin to ""THE quintessential version of the story"", etc, and... it's the quintessential all right... THE quintessential 'style-over-substance' anime film ever produced.""

First, the good; this won't take long.

-Like the first film, there was a single scene that I literally did like; which is more than I could say about the second film). The part just before Griffith decides to sacrifice his Band; he slowly turns to Guts with a smirk on his face. That captured the moment perfectly; music, visuals, everything was spot on. Granted, it was still ruined because of the horrible abridgement of the series, but, pretending that it was there, it was an excellent scene.

And... literally, that's it. I found myself utterly annoyed by just about everything else in this movie. It was just a chore to sit through.

Now, the bad; in order. As an aspiring writer myself, this is a perfect recreation, just for you, of me watching it:

- We start with Silat attacking the downed Band of the Hawk. For.... what reason exactly? It's never explained? Are we supposed to imply that maybe the King is offering bounties for the heads of the Hawks, and every mercenary in the land wants it? ...Fair enough. But then, out of literal nowhere, Guts shows up at just the right moment to save them all.
This worked in the manga because backstory is then given about where Guts has been, how he and Silat found out about the condition of the Hawks and Guts' desire to go save the only friends he's ever known.

The anime never explains where Guts has been for that year; no one even asks. And... if he made such a big deal leaving in the climax of the last movie, why did he ever come back? Let alone within the first 5 minutes? It renders all the drama of that scene and the climax of the entire last movie entirely moot.

This right here is why these movies don't work. The writing is backwards; I feel that the people behind it didn't even really understand Berserk the same way as Miura intended; they just saw it as ""As long as this scene LOOKS the same, then it's still the same"" without fully grasping that Berserk's tight narrative depends upon each past scene that was set up and then progresses from character motivations; not just because it has to happen. You can't just throw something in the same way and expect it to work. They literally had no clue what they were adapting.

That's a good start; right off the bat.

Speaking of Silat, it makes me wonder how the Kushan Invasion much
later on is going to play out without the Bakiraka first appearance during
the Hawk's attempted rescue of Griffith, which was also cut, by the way. But, that's the least of our problems.

-Next we get the most painful scene to watch in the entire film: the token sex scene between Guts and Casca. This was supposed to be a very genuine moment between both characters finally accepting and understanding each other, and acknowledging that yes, they did in fact love one another.

I already wrote how poorly I think the last movie captured their romance, but this one just added insult to injury. Again, ""Guess she likes him now... for some reason. Now have sex."" That's literally it.
Guts' adoptive father Gambino or Donovan; which I was hoping would finally be mentioned here after their absence were again skipped over. So... we know absolutely nothing about Guts' backstory whatsoever, apart from the vaguest flashback from movie 1; that no one who's never read the manga will get, at all. There is no struggle or talk between characters; they literally just have token sex.

And why do I keep saying 'token' anyway? It literally is. Their child that is later tainted by Femto's rape at the Eclipse that turns into a Demonic fetus (that later places a crucial role in the story) is never mentioned, seen, acknowledged, nothing. So... the sex accomplishes literally accomplishes nothing, story-wise, apart from flashing a pair of tits to the fanboys.
Sigh...

So, after that, Guts immediately runs into the Skull Knight; literally within the same hour. Unlike in the manga, he doesn't even warn him or call him a ""Struggler"".... so, I have to ask why he even appeared.

And this is THE prime example of what I was talking about here with backwards writing. These movies don't do setups and payoffs, like in the manga, no, they do what I like to call the ultra-lazy ""Reverse payoff"". What is that, you ask?

It's when something NEEDS to happen, and instead of going back to properly fit it into the story, you just make it happen, out of nowhere.

I'm going to give you an example of what could have saved the last movie. It ends with Guts camping out alone on his first night alone after leaving the Hawks, and then the Skull Knight appears, warning him that his actions has set the Eclipse into motion one year from then, and then leaves.

Sound familiar? Just as the manga showed it?

Not only would this have tightened the story up and added drama and/or tension into Guts' decision to leave, but it also could have provided a reason for his immediate return in this movie, WITHOUT dwelling on where he's been and burning more time on that.

But... nope; Princess Charlotte has to mention King Gaiseric in the Tower, which alludes back to the Skull Knight coming up, so Guts HAS TO run into him immediately before that.

Probably what really irks me most about this is that Berserk is so much better than that; and if I were judging it solely on this movies, I'd be like ""Wow, Berserk has really lazy writing"" solely because of the films. It's truly a great injustice to Miura's epic tale.

And, since the demon infant has to appear if they hope to continue; here's my guess on how it'll be done. If they ever do the Snake Baron, Guts will come across it as usual, start convenient flashback showing everything that wasn't included in movie 3, bingo, instant ""Yes, that happened. It's important"" reverse payoff! So simple, even a monkey can do it!

The level to which this story has been dumbed down is just offense to everyone who truly loved it for it's complicity and subtlety.

Moving on...

-As a foreboding to the events of the Eclipse; farmers or whoever see a giant Apostle heading through the fields. This was the Snake Baron in both the manga and original anime; a subtle hint to the events we had already been privy to, that now, we're finally going to see what happened. It built excitement and dread all at once.

But here, it's the Female Apostle; the one who Guts kills in volume 1 and the one who kills Corkus at the Eclipse. Okay, fine. But, I have one problem with this scene; she's gigantic. When was she EVER able to do that? And if she could, don't you think she would have used that ability to not be killed by Guts later on? So, how is that going to be handled? ...Whoops.

I think the Count probably would have been a better choice. You get to see him at the Eclipse, just like the manga, with Pippin. It would have worked, and it would have added more, since he's the first Apostle we ever get to fully delve into.

The minor problems are beginning to add up...

- The King looks exactly the same when he orders all his men to destroy the Band of the Hawks. This is a critical error on the production team's part. Despite Griffith alluding to the King's lust for his daughter Charlotte in the last movie, his attempted rape of her never happened, so... his emotional, and thus then physical breakdown never happens. So.... how is the King going to die later on? You know, the event that starts the entire Kushan invasion? Is he just going to inexplicably be sick in a later film? Why?
Are they not realizing how badly they're ruining their chances FOR a continuation here?

-Rickert never breaks his arm. This is literally the reason why he was privy to not have been at the Eclipse, and why he survives. So... if his arm isn't broken, why didn't he also accompany the others to rescue Griffith? Why was he off by himself and not even with the Hawks at all? It's never mentioned or addressed. Maybe he stumbled away to go pick flowers? I mean, you're left with no reason AT ALL.

-The Skull Knight and Zodd are fighting outside the Eclipse with Rickert watching; exactly like the manga, no problems, but then the Skull Knight finds Rickert and hands Guts and Casca over to him. Where's Zodd? Are they implying he died? Well, I guess he'll just magically show up again and we'll just be like ""Oh, I guess, he left and didn't do anything; that was lucky that he let Guts and Casca get treated and escape.""

-Rickert never comes across the gypsy wagon with Puck (and his fairydust). So... he was somehow able to save Guts' life without magical medicine? News to me; massive blood loss from losing a limb was the most minor-est of injuries back in the Dark Ages. Okay, that makes sense.

-Ironically, they actually DO show Puck in a wagon (even though Rickert never meets him), which actually creates another plot hole solely BECAUSE of the movie. The last movie included a scene of Guts exiting the city, where there's a wagon holding Puck in a cage, implying he was captured and is being sold, whatever. So... Puck escaped in that same year, went and hung out with some gypsies, didn't meet Rickert, and then got captured AGAIN, only to have Guts unintentionally save him? This begs the question; if he could escape that first time, why not the second?
All because the last movie had to include a pointless cameo. Nice job. The last movie had several self-created plot holes too; regarding Adon not being captured, etc... but I won't go into it.

-Now, we move onto the Eclipse.

It looked really nice; don't get me wrong, but the biggest problems come from again not knowing who ANY of his teammates are. Gaston? Guts keeps mentioning him a whole lot, but if I go by just the movies, I have no idea who that even is. I don't think it even mentions that he was Guts' second in his raid team; even THAT much. So, we're supposed to care that he's dead? Sorry, I don't.

Corkus and Pippin's deaths were handled well enough, but my biggest problem came from Judeau's.

I honestly never thought I'd be laughing, but I was. There was no lamenting on his end, no torn up arm; I'm not even kidding here, it was literally a *drops dead*, PLOP, moment. I actually laughed than felt sorry for him. Not that I ever knew him to begin with.

-Immediately thereafter, Casca is surrounded by Apostles on all sides and the scene just cuts; that's fine, implying that she either has to fight or is killed, but the problem is, next we see her, she's inexplicably naked and not dead. There's no implication that she was going to be raped or anything; I was just left with the feeling ""Well, that was lucky that they didn't kill her like everyone else!""

In the manga and first series, the scene ends only after her armor is ripped off, clearly showing that she's going to be raped before being killed, when Guts stumbles upon her. Makes perfect sense.
Yes, Casca is the only female there and most of the Apostles are male; rape is a given, but still; would I really believe that Apostles wouldn't be below corpse rape? Why didn't they just kill her? If you really stop and think about it; this movie makes zero sense.

-So then, at last, Guts rips his arm off and dashes up towards Femto with his broken sword, only to pause. This was never in the manga, and was obviously just a showy moment. I guess he was stopped by his aura or something; since I doubt he would actually hesitate after willingly cutting off his own forearm just to get loose. But it begs the question, why would the Apostles surrounding them WAIT for Guts even to have a chance? They take like a full minute before they grab him again. Why?
In the original manga and anime, Guts is immediately subdued again after escaping.

We're getting closer to the end:

-So after Rickert and the Skull Knight take Guts and Casca off, they just HAPPENED upon Elicia and Godos... oh wait, Godo's not in this film, at all; so it's just Elicia; Elicia's farm for them all to recover after the Eclipse. Guts doesn't know her (it's stated as such, they've never met), nor does she have any backstory. Boy, that sure is awfully convenient, in the Dark Ages to find people so friendly and willing to take in half-dead strangers and nurse them back to health. And with no Godo, does this little 8 year old girl live alone? Is SHE the master blacksmith who reequips Guts? An 8 year old girl. Oh, and where's Casca? Oh, this total stranger just also HAPPENS to have a magic Elf mine. ..Convenient!!

-And, then we end... on a laughable music video to show Guts in the Band of the Hawk. I guess, even the filmmakers knew by this point that we really didn't know any of them, so they had further pound it into our heads ""YES, GUTS LOST HIS TREASURED FRIENDS."" You know, all those deep relationships that we never got to see.

And finally, the nail in the coffin; a gigantic wall of text ""THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.""

This is why I hate these films. They are so utterly pretentious. Toot your own horn, yep, you're continuing it! Despite every single thing I just wrote explaining how it's now IMPOSSIBLE to ever hope to continue it... at least, correctly. They're so full of themselves, they had to show Griffith's descent into evil; with Gainex-inspired clusterf*** not once, but TWICE, just because they were just so impressed with their work there, I guess.

And THIS was the attempt, and I quote, to ""Adapt the full series""?

Well, you only missed about 8 volumes now in these 3 movies.

How can they ever hope to continue this? They may as well just left the Golden Age in the first series and just continued from there. And the worst part is, fanboys will defend this movie on the grounds of either 1. ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING or 2. THE ACTION AND ANIMATION ARE GREAT.

Allow me to refute you, right here.

1. Berserk is a truly excellent manga. Does it EVER need to be adapted into anime to be BETTER? Do you not have a favorite book or something that has never been made into a movie? Does that decrease your liking of it any less?
And honestly, I'd rather have nothing at all than such a flawed, cash-grab attempt.

2. Imagine if the first anime series and this movie swapped animation. Do you then think ANYONE would rave about this movies the way they do? I doubt it. Good production values and animation do NOT make something good.
Why do people think like this?

In short, this is a dumbed down version of Berserk, that ironically, appeals to no one. To a newbie, they would have no clue about the story, characters, setting, and will utterly fail to make any sort of connection with anything. Stuff like Guts' past flashback in movie 1 will be entirely lost on them, so, in a sense, it's made more for people who already know and love Berserk... ironically, not even appealing to them, due to their lackluster execution of it.
It appeals to literally no one, apart from drooling fanboys who only want action and bare breasts. And I highly doubt any of THEM would ever read Berserk in the first place.",1377302400,23,18455,4.525225225225225

I will be VERY disappointed of they skip the demon birth and Guts' first apostle kill and move on to the Black Swordsman arc.",1377129600,11,2567,4.662251655629139

Please note thate there is a really nasty rape scene in the second half that actually affected my friend's ability to sleep, and the the gore is just a bit too gratuitous.
I Definitely still recommended if you plan to start the 2016 version of the anime which continues this story, though that is turning out to be a horrible rendition.

5716281,4,B00CDH9VEE,"Having seen the whole series, my opinion is for all three movies and not just this one. ""Berserk"" is clearly one of the most violent and dark anime movies around and is easily not for the Pokmon crowd. Set in a medieval fantasy world, it could well be the ""Game of Thrones"" of anime. It's got battles, betrayal, sex, demons, and more blood than ten horror films. The first film is like an intro to our characters, and is perhaps the tamest of the three, although its still pretty much rated R material. The next two films is when the bloody battles and occasional sex scenes (two of them are like what you see on those soft core movies that Cinemax used to run on late night back in the day while another involving a demon raping a young woman isn't meant to be erotic at all). But this is more than just mindless sex and violence. The story is quite good with some great characters who grow on you as the story progresses. Also the artwork looks quite good, (the characters look a lot more adult than in most animes, even the teenage ones)  although not all of the animation quite works. Its for the sometimes uneven animation and the fact that this isn't for everyone (read above)which is why I'm not giving this the highest rating.",1467417600,,1234,4.412280701754386

5716312,4,B00CDH9VEE,"Although I absolutely LOVED the tv series, I thought the first movie was a total butt-wipe video!
While most people disliked the cgi, I was turned down by the overall low quality of the movie; the low character depth, and how I felt that ARC 1 was just a collage of events, without story line.

The second one was a huge bump up in video quality, but the plots, character depth and some scenes still where absolutely garbage (read my critical, but in my opinion true, review on arc 2).
This third one actually is the first one I would consider a worthy copy of the tv series.
Not only the story line, but also fragments of the music they copied of the original series. The characters seemed more realistic, so nice polishing up on those as well..
There are also a lot of psychadelic visuals to see (weird, awkward, yet attractive). Things we didn't see in the original series.
It is actually the first where I managed to watch the entire movie without total boredom, or skipping parts!

If the tv series got an 9.8 out of 10,
Arc 1 got a 1.8
Arc 2 got a 3.2
And arc 3 got a 6.8 to 7.8 on visuals and certain parts of the events in the movie, while less and less parts of the movie are done by amators, it still has ways to go, to match up to the original series!

My advise to the creators:
Keep bumping up the realism!
Keep thinking about cause and effect!
Keep deepening and working out the characters and their dubbing voice actor flaws, and keep more space for the development of the characters, their feelings, and the damn shithole situation they find themselves in (no bandid loving a life on the run, seeking alcohol for easing of pain, is going to be happy and clappy).
And combine action with beauty, like in the original TV series, combining Guts' 100 bandids fight with beautiful esoteric music.
I think the introduction of New Age music, and voice sounds give the movie an exotic flair that combined with hardship, bring out the best in these kinds of movies.
If you watch Hokuto No Ken, the TV series, at a certain point the series have an ending song ""I don't like love, but I love you"",
A song so foreign to the film, yet so fitting!
New age music, beauty, voice effects, where items of the tv series, that made them popular.

If you need ideas, why don't you in your free time play Cryo's 1994 PC game of ""The Lost Eden"" (Later purchased by Virgin),
And see if you can learn a thing or two in voice acting, story telling, and esoteric music!",1449792000,,2458,4.348583877995643

If I can give this remake of Berserk any credit at all in the midst of its flaws, then it would definitely be its steady progression towards the better. This third installment manages to capture some of the essence of the original; and although there are some things left out or outright changed. I have to admit that the new additions make up for a lot of these things. In fact, the ending is far better this time providing a lot more very necessary closure that the original was lacking.  Now does this bit of information justify a remake of this series? Well, when looking at how so much was missing from the first two movies, rushed character development and story elements that can feel brushed upon even for a newcomer. The answer for me is still no. I would have much preferred a re-release of the original in its full glory with the story being continued, because let's face it, the ending here could have worked as a flashback of sorts for Guts. In any case, this volume is still better than previous volumes.

The animation still managed to improve in each installment with a minimum of flaws. The dark dungeons fits very well with the personality of this series, along with the hellish setting late in the movie. It truly creates a rather haunting atmosphere as if death is only arms length away, in which it is actually. The backgrounds are simply excellent around nearly ever corner, with vibrant, hazy flashbacks and bright sunny days. The action is still as barbaric as before capturing the brutality of this world. There is little left up to the imagination with various slashes and stabbings. Even after I thought that I seen it all, there was still one sick moment involving a blade. The CG still has its slight problems with one moment standing out when the soldiers when running forward, they all appeared to be kind of bow-legged. I don't think I've ever seen anyone run like that.

The plot follows The Hawks after they're brutally attacked and Guts appears to save them. From here they plan to rescue Griffith from the castle's dungeon with inside help, and things take another sinister turn for the group.

I'm happy to be wrong about some things coming into this volume in regards to the writing. The previous volume felt quite mad cap at times, with things simply happening just because. This time things are more wire-tight with well understood motivations and drives. The character development is quite better and one will have more of an understanding of Griffith and Caska. Unfortunately, some of the other characters are still present for a headcount given lines here and there. However, Guts felt a little short changed here simply appearing.

I know it's redundant by this point to harp on the changes that will bother many older fans, but it is what it is. There were things especially involving Guts that was cut out completely and these things would have helped more towards his full development; but newbies will indeed get the most out if this which is the writers and production teams aim anyway.

In closing, despite this volume not being as heavily action packed as the previous volume; it does contain a good amount of action anyway and it's very well paced and quite engrossing. I will point out that the final act doesn't feel as horror oriented as the original due to its cleaner visuals and less than sinister OST. The original was a product of a darker era in anime that I don't think can be easily replicated through a remake. In any case, I think older fans should skip this volume if they totally hated the first two, and I'm talking if they found no enjoyment in those at all. However, if the previous volumes were at least watchable then definitely try this out. Newbies shouldn't even hesitate in grabbing this, but I highly advise to watch the original at some point if possible.

Pros: Solid conclusion with better closure, better paced and developed

Cons: Some missteps in character development, older fans may still cringe",1437523200,,4290,4.7017310252996

5716377,5,B00CDH9VEE,"I watched the first BESERK movie in this series as a freebie on either Netflix or Amazon Prime, I forget which.  The quality of the animation [which equaled that of any animations produced by Miyazaki's Ghibli Studios]. and the admixture of a few fantasy elements with what IMO was a disciplined adherence to creating historically accurate depictions of ordinary life, politics, and warfare in the calamitous 14th Century altogether pleased me enormously.  The second and third ""episodes"" were increasingly dominated by the fantasy elements contained in this Medieval ""buddy"" saga, but to my surprise I have not been put off by that.  On the contrary, after viewing Episode III I have come to believe that there was no better way to continue developing the BESERK storyline without pushing its fantasy element to the extreme.  That said, throughout episodes I-III the BESERK socio-political and visual environments have remained committed to depicting accurately what we know of how we lived in the Dark Ages; and that continues to please me enormously.  If you find entertaining the HBO series Throne of Kings, if you admire pinnacle-quality animation, then you will almost certainly like the BESERK trilogy.  Parental Warning:  these anime are graphically violent with some sexual scenes.",1428451200,,1290,5.294117647058823

Though the first movie got me interested and hooked on this series because of its rich animation (i saw some clips of the tv series and the movies are definitely amping up the computer generated aspect of the animation and it's way better for me) and intriguing plot, this third book really went to the next level of gore and eroticism (mature content) that leaves you wanting baffled, confused and wanting to explore more of this world. It's gonna ""Eff"" u up at some point...I read it's underrated...then i watched it and agree...it's not for everybody though, if ur moral compass is routed towards PG13 or something more kid friendly...this is definitely NOT your Thursday night Naruto. It's a really good summary of the first season, from what i read online u have to read the manga or watch the series if u want more detailed content though...but if u only have time for a quick but tasty rundown of the series this is the way to go.",1428451200,,963,4.604651162790698
5716379,4,B00CDH9VEE,"These movies were originally meant to be one single animation, but due to the length, they were split into three. Therefore, my review of this movie will be taking the other two movies into account as well, due to the fact that if judged separately, they would not receive the appropriate praise that they should.

With that in mind, the three Golden Age Arc movies are a decent summary of one of the best manga ever written. I say summary because even though it does a fair job of making the original story come to life, it unfortunately still leaves out various crucial elements. While I believe that the animation studio did intend to recreate the original Berserk storyline, according to many of the fans I've spoken with (myself included), these movies are instead seen viewed as a kind of synopsis of the full story. While it is of course understood that during production, many events and other aspects must sometimes be cut out due to budgets and time constraints, the fact still remains that many significant events were either underdeveloped and shown with much scarcity or, in some cases, disregarded altogether.

The other issue that many fans have with these movies is the obvious use of CGI. While the motions and fight scenes of characters are in a sense, more realistic, the fact that the CGI is clearly visible in comparison to the regular animation (which makes up the remainder of the scene) makes things seem a bit strange. In short, I'd say that for the majority of the time that the CGI is used, it's obvious presence proves to be distracting. Through CGI, the level of motion, character, and background detail are all very impressive, however, I believe that when combined with regular animation, the result was an ""abnormal"" appearance for viewers.
Fortunately, in order to address some of these CGI related issues, a fan-edit of the movies has been made which also incorporates the original 1990's animation series of Berserk in an attempt to focus on improving both character development and much of the manga's plot which the trilogy left out. While there are still various important events omitted from the 1990's series as well, the combination of the series and the trilogy due a respectable job of getting as close as currently possible to the manga's story while still providing an exciting cinematic pace through the use of animation.
For those interested, the fan-edit can be found here: https://vimeo.com/album/2610343

With all that said, despite it's flaws, I'm sure I speak for many fans when I say that any new Berserk related material is always exciting. While the results may not have been what we hoped, these movies provided a refreshing new perspective using modern techniques in order to present to fans, a new side of Berserk never before seen.

TL/DR: If you're unsure about starting the manga, either watch the movies or watch the 90's anime or better yet, watch the fan-made redux edit which incorporates both. Then dive into the manga and weep as all of your happiness and joy is slowly eaten away.

I enjoyed The Golden Age Arc I&II, but not III.
The Golden Age Arc I and II, both had a decent story line.
Character relationship building situations.
Good plausibility.
Decent plot
and Story goal.

Golden Age Arc III

I didn't like. Plausibility left the story.
There wasn't enough story build in the direction of the whole demonic thing.
I'm not a fan of grim endings, but if they had done it in a more plausible fashion I could have accepted any ending, just as long as the ending's purpose is fitting for the story. Almost all the characters were killed in a matter of minutes by a bunch of creatures. That scene felt very rushed. The rape scene was empty and served no purpose in my opinion. It seemed like a failed attempt at a love triangle. And the love/sex scene between Guts and Casca was empty, too. You cannot satisfy the struggle between Casca's and Gut's relationship with a weak sex scene. Hell, you can't satisfy it with a good one. Viewers didn't even get a chance to enjoy Casca's and Gut's relationship victory. The Love/Sex scene between Griffith and Princess from the second Golden Age Arc was decent. It held some feeling.

5716416,3,B00CDH9VEE,"It's the best of the three films but still pales in comparison to the 90's anime.  This is perhaps inevitable as these movies try to fit lots of characterization into a very short running time.  Frankly, it's hard to care about what happens to these people when you only get to know three of them (Griffith, Guts, and Caska a bit).  Berserks as a story was never just about them and if the movies suffer, it's from this cliffnotes approach to the story.  As for the pros of this: the dungeon sequence/rescue of Griffith is more fleshed out, the attempted suicide of Griffith actually superior to the anime series' depiction, and the entrance of the godhand awesome.  Strangely, once the eclipse gets going it's actually LESS horrific than what was shown in the 90's anime even though it's beautifully animated (perhaps this is a problem of this sequence as it should have something ugly and brutal about it, not gorgeous).  The film goes to show a little past the events of the eclipse but upon repeat viewings, it is a bit ""meh"" for me.  Overall, nice try and for the curious/casual viewer...diehards will be disappointed.",1409270400,3,1123,4.728205128205128

The English dub also features much of the original cast used in the Berserk series from 1997. While this movie could be a bit longer (namely to improve overall character development), it serves as quite a feast for the eyes and an excellent reduction of a series-to-movie!",1408060800,,392,5.046153846153846

5716426,5,B00CDH9VEE,"First off, lets get this out in the air.  If someone asks me about berserk, I'm going to say something like DUDE!  You gotta watch it!!!  Then go off muttering the storyline dancing around spoilers.  Guts is probably my favorite hero of any story I've ever read or seen.  If you like Conan, Hellraiser, and Tolkien folk lore, you'll probably fall in love.  If those series had a baby, it would be berserk.

Berserk is not for the faint of heart.  Berserk is not for the person looking for the happy ending.  To me, there is no other form of media I relish like this story.  Books, comic, movies, games, campfire stories do nothing for me like berserk does.  I do stress, if you enjoy this movie, read the manga.  That's right, this is based off a comic.  That being said this is the last part of the very beginning of an amazing story.  One rich with war, fantasy, horror, betrayal, revenge, and magic.  Sound exciting?  THIS IS FOR ADULTS.  If you let your children watch this you're pretty s***ty parents.  The original anime ended in a place some didn't like, this will finish off the same part of the story, just no cliffhanger.  You'll no what direction the story goes after this.  Anyhow...

The band of the hawk are led starving and tired after the kingdom sets out after the once renowned heroes of midland.  Griffith becoming desperate after losing his right hand man (guts), goes straight to the princess and is caught with her and thrown to the dungeon.  Guts is off finding out who he is and hears of the hawks falling under the prey of the kingdom and any mercenary who can catch fetch the reward for their heads.  No spoilers but this is one of the very most disturbing things you will see.  Its not shock value, there is a reason, it all plays into the story.  PLEASE if you enjoy this, buy the manga.  You will not be disappointed.  That being said this story is not for everyone.  I would be surprised if it all ended with everyone running off into a field smiling.  Watch, enjoy, and if you don't enjoy, you'll definitely want to steer clear of it, lol.",1407283200,,2071,4.430851063829787

5716430,5,B00CDH9VEE,"Intro:
Beware, this is not for children. This cannot be expressed enough for the final film in this trilogy. As a great fan of the series, I am very happy to say that this movie follows the manga extremely closely while managing to improve upon the first two in almost every way.

Animation 4.5/5
This movie has finally fixed the issue with the CG portions of animation. They now use standard animation when dealing with most faces, while the rest of them is CG. I know, this may sound terrible, but hold your judgments until you experience it firsthand. It is breathtaking. The final portion of the film especially is well-animated, brutal, and somehow beautiful. I will avoid spoilers, but it is a sight to behold. Only a very few minor hiccups (again, why does Corkus always get the bad animation?) mar an otherwise gorgeous presentation.

Audio 5/5
The voice acting is easily at its best in this final installment. The music (or lack thereof) fits the dark moments perfectly. The issue with the overly large range of volume on the 5.1 track has been addressed, while still having a healthy amount for a fantastic surround-sound experience.

Story 5/5
I cannot say much about the this without massive spoilers, but I will say that the content found in the final chapter may turn some people off of the story. I personally found it fascinating, with the direction the series will go being abundantly clear. This story is not for the faint of heart by any means. There are no lines that the movie will not cross, and I am happy to say that they did not leave anything out from the original manga for the sake of being more appropriate. Strap in fellows.

Overall 5/5
This movie is easily the best of the trilogy, in every way. Some people may disapprove of the level of violence or sexuality present in the final chapter, but you have been thoroughly warned. If you can handle it, you're in for an epic story and some truly memorable moments that will stick with you for years to come.",1406505600,3,1986,4.601694915254237

You will need to have at least watched the previous two to understand most of the characters and plot. But if you've been a fan of Berserk Manga or the previous series, you know that this is the most important part of the entire story. Very bloody, emotional and powerful. You can't help but feel for the characters and hope that somehow everything turns out OK.

I really liked the first two movies, but this third installment.... What the hey? The first two were very grounded in a pseudo-historical setting with a hint of magic.

SPOILER: But this third one.... By the end, the entire story-line is scrubbed clean of any past attachment, and we're left with three completely changed and essentially destroyed characters. How can they bring back any kind of cohesion in a fourth movie without descending into the bizarre, abstract supernatural again? I don't think it's possible. It's probably time to call it ""The End"", as tragic as it is.",1402099200,6,744,4.896825396825397

I can't believe I'm saying this, but two unnecessary sexual encounters as they did nothing to move the plot forward.
Lots of unresolved character and plot buildup.  Main characters were emotionally vulnerable and therefore physically compromised for most of the movie.

5716464,5,B00CDH9VEE,"So the animation quality itself is outstanding, the story pacing and content is a blend of the previous animated series and the manga.  Some big things cut out that I was honestly surprised was the character of Wyald.  I don't see how it would have been that much harder to include a short scene of the King of Midland ordering him out to reclaim Griffith because we get a reaction shot from him being informed of Griffith's escape!  I really did expect to see him show up and immediately go apostle form and give the Hawks battle and then have Zodd swoop in while Guts and company chased after Griffith's carriage.  No such luck there, but we do finally have the Skull Knight make his presence known!  His time and space entrance have changed but ultimately it still works and we're no worse off.

The English voice cast are incredible, as they were before.  I am not a strictly exclusively dub or sub viewer, it's a case by case basis.  In this case, I really am impressed and wouldn't watch it any other way than in English.  Overall, if you're new to Berserk go ahead and watch these movies first, then watch the animated TV series to flesh out the characters more.  If you saw the TV series then get this to enjoy some of those former plot holes filled in.",1399075200,,1261,4.41991341991342

All three movies are worth watching if you are a true Berserk fan like myself. Even the dubbing was spot on terrific. And not to mention the CGI mixed in with the animation adds more to this series.
Definitely get all three to enjoy the set. I just wish they had more movies involving Guts's quest for vengeance after he becomes the ""Black Swordsman"" like the manga.
That would be stellar.

5716473,4,B00CDH9VEE,"First off it goes without saying that this movie is violent, gory, and contains nudity and sex scenes. Some of the scenes are quite shocking and disturbing so it is not for the thinned-skinned. That being said I have seen the Japanese anime but have not read the manga that this movie is based on (but this movie has made me want to read the manga). Most movies that adapt Japanese anime or manga are usually pretty terrible but this one actually does a good job of condensing it all without cutting out too much of the character and plot development. Overall a very good series if you enjoy old style fantasy or classic Japanese anime.",1398124800,,636,4.491379310344827
5716474,5,B00CDH9VEE,"I enjoyed the first film, and the second was even better. After a long wait for the 3rd movie, I had high expectations and was not disappointed. The Advent for me was the best of the 3 as it had the best animation and pacing. Loved all of the action scenes, Guts is even more badass than in the Battle for Doldrey. The tone in the 3rd movie is completely different from the first 2, which suits the story since it gets dark from here on out. Extras and bonus features are disappointing, but that's not a surprise considering they didn't give us much in the first 2. Overall, this is a trilogy that is worth multiple re-watches until the Black Swordsman arc is (hopefully) released.",1398038400,,681,4.412698412698413

5716476,5,B00CDH9VEE,"So the third part of the Golden Age Arc is finally out and was it worth the wait? In a work: yes. It's fantastic, the animation just gets better and better with each movie; the voice acting is still top notch on both the Japanese and English tracks. Once again Viz has managed to bring back much of the cast from the English dub of the TV show (and as always it's a massive boon for fans of the dub). Now on to the movie proper: The Advent is HARD to watch, like Red Wedding hard; you will cringe at the level of violence in this as they did not shy away from depicting damn near everything from the manga that happens during the part they are adapting. It's flat out disturbing during certain parts (a word of warning: do NOT watch this around anyone who's sensitive to scenes of torture or rape, it will at the very least make them super uncomfortable if not send them from the room). The main draw for fans who've seen the TV show/read the manga will be the new and never before animated characters that are added or restored to the story (and they are just awesome some of the best animation in the movie is the cameo near the beginning and the just epic fight between two of the Berserk world heavy hitters near the end it just looks amazing). This is easily the best movie of the Golden Age Arc, now bring on the Black Swordsman Arc, the Conviction Arc and beyond!",1397779200,,1370,4.252873563218391

This is the perfect supplement for those who have watched the anime or even those new to the series who are curious. 5 STARS",1397692800,,323,4.586206896551724
5716478,5,B00CDH9VEE,I imported this fully uncut and have to say that like the previous 2 movies this is absolutely fantastic. The berserk story is brutal as is it is beautiful and the films capture the golden age arc brilliantly. That said they are films and so of course some of the meat if the story is left out. However what I found most satisfying about the third Movie is that it doesn't shy away or downgrade the violence and sexual violence to cater to a wider audience. More importantly we are introduced to the skull knight a character whose lack if presence in the original anime left a gaping hole at the end! Watch this movie to understand what I mean. Top notch film and I love it. Roll on the black swordsman arc!,1394841600,11,707,4.323308270676692
5716479,2,B00CDH9VEE,"The Berserk manga is my favorite peace of modern literature, i wear a Behelit around my neck every workday and this review is a response to D. Stockard 1/5 review as his thought encapsulate mine perfectly but i liked a few more scenes. One would be Griffith's trippy transformation and his short fight against the Skull Knight. Thus i give it a slightly better rating but the movie committed the worst sin of all. Being boring, besides being irritating which is a given at this point and the animation process wasn't finished as always. Movie 2 is the worst btw. from a cinematic standpoint as it was just 3 extended scenes with no context but movie 3 straight out vomit over the last parts of the Eclipse as it glorifies rape so i would like to know what Miura thought of this adaptation. Who knows what the studio will do with the rest of the manga but they should just stop. The folks at skullknight forums would love that but at least this whole project will give me a few nice amv's and maybe a new Susuma song? Well one can dream.",1393027200,4,1036,4.401041666666667

5716481,5,B00CDH9VEE,"Lemme say I read the manga and am proud owner of the older anime and I still love these movies. People like to complain about the animation, and ""oooo why didn't they do that one scene!? This is crap because it's not exactly the same as the original! The animation isn't super high budget. Waaaah!"" To those people I say; STFU and enjoy it for what it is! If you prefer the manga then read that and stop your complaining. I love the manga, but seeing the characters brought to life is awesome. If egregious violence and animated breasts are too much for you then go back to watching care bears! Berserk doesn't hold back, and that's why I effin love this series!",1391558400,9,662,4.390243902439025

8580514,4,B00CDH9VEE,I finished the final 2 parts in one night I had to keep going... Its that good. I like dark but this was really dark and the way things went was well unexpected. Not for anyone under 16 seriously no joke its pretty rough - the entire last half takes you on a journey to the dark recesses of Toshiyuki's mind and as bizarre as that is take logic and toss it out the window get on board and hang on... very very dark... I loved it...,1513036800,,431,3.9655172413793105
