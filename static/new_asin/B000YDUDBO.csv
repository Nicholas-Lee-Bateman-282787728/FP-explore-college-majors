I've been looking for any episodes of The Ruggles for ages! I love Charlie Ruggles & this beloved series from televisions golden age. Such clean, wholesome values & good old fashioned fun the way it should be.  This show is poignant & heartwarming.  I think other fans of this particular genre will agree.

Go to TVShowsOnDVD's site to cast your vote for a release of The Ruggles (1949-1952) to DVD. Also, a DVD containing four additional episodes can be found by a merchant on eBay.

This is a treat for sure due to the fact that only a handful of episodes still exist as this program had been done on live television & what has been preserved was shot on kinescope.  This holiday episode is a keeper!",1224720000,,741,4.5
