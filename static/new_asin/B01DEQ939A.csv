8755724,2,B01DEQ939A,This anime made me sad. I waited quite a while for this manga to become and anime. And it stunk. The artwork was cool and it was nice to see the characters but it seemed more like short stories from the manga than the actual story. Horrible transitions between episodes. Only 10 episodes in total and you learn nothing about the characters except they have secrets and are on an adventure.,1485043200,,389,4.492957746478873
