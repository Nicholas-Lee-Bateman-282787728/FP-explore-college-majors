8442696,4,B004V2FVAW,"This is an excellent movie from the 80's with a great multi cast. I recommend everyone watch this film even though its been outdated. Jayaprada's performance is absolutely great and she does an excellent job playing her role both has the mother and dedicated wife. The story line is not your typical bad guy vs good guy but about the sacrifices a women makes and how she is misunderstood just to keep a promise.

The film also has excellent soundtracks and great dance performances from Govinda and Neelam whom were a trendy pair during that era. This is also the first time you will see Shashi Kappoor and Jayaprada both paired together.",1306281600,,638,4.696428571428571
