8041070,1,B0006BB9N0,"Buyer beware: This is the first in a series of cooking DVDs, which came out some years ago; however, this is the only DVD ever made (there is no ""Cooking Club,"" as advertised at Amazon or on the DVD jacket). Regarding the Saute DVD: If you're used to watching the Food Network then forget this one. This chef does it unscripted and apparently without re-takes and he doesn't have the gift of off-the-cuff small talk and although he may know how to cook himself he doesn't seem to be much of a teacher. Examples: He cooks several dishes but refers you to one of his other DVDs for some part of what he is preparing... right, but all those other DVDs never got made. Any way, every single series DVD should stand on it's own. Everything he demonstrates is completed with the very same greasy pan sauce composed of a third of a stick of butter [or more] -- I mean it's the very same pan sauce over and over: shallots, wine, butter. I think he tried to shoot the whole DVD on the same day and by the last demonstration he is losing it when he has four bowls of ingrediants at his work space but only tells you what is in three of bowls! The problem might be that he is seen drinking the cooking wine from the begining to the end of this DVD.",1180051200,6,1237,4.223628691983122
