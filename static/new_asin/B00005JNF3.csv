I would for sure be the favorite daughter if I were able to give both to my mom on DVD... :)",1112313600,,263,3.888888888888889
1513395,5,B00005JNF3,"...and yes, I'm begging more than James Brown!

This is one of the greatest movies that I have ever had a chance to see. I'm 21 years old and I vaguely remember it all, but PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE release this soon! There are so many people that would like to see this classic movie once again. Also, release the other POLLY- from my understanding, there are 2 parts to the movie.

And while we're at voting for movies, does anyone know where and how we can get a copy of the 1978(?) movie CINDY? It's the African American version of Cinderella, put out way before Brandy's version. I had an opportunity to see a portion of it on the Disney channel almost 10 years ago, I would definately love to see it again!

Please consider these 2 movies!

Take care and you won't regret it!",1111795200,,800,4.458904109589041

1513397,5,B00005JNF3,"In my opinion, this movie is such an incredible movie for the entire family.  It instills great morals, love, friendship, as well as excellent music.

1513398,5,B00005JNF3,"I have been looking for this movie and the first one for so long, and I can't wait until it's out.  When I was younger I had the biggest crush on Brandon Adams (Jimmy). I'm hoping they decide to bring out the first one at the same time and sell it in a box set. Trust me people both of these movies are great and they have one of the best all star cast. When you watch it your gonna try to name everybody in the movie you remember and try to guest what other movies you seen them in.",1107820800,,483,3.83

 Like many others I grew up watchin this movie. I have looked for the last five years for someone with the movie that would sell it. I went to sell.com and they have it there. I bought both Polly and Polly Coming Home for under $15.00. I ordered about 5 copies and they arrived 2 days after placing my order. All copies played great and I am know currently singing along with the music. This is a great movie to have in any movie collection. this movie is for the whole family. Good luck and enjoy.",1104969600,,503,4.175257731958763
1513401,5,B00005JNF3,"I have been looking for this movie for a couple of years and I am so excited that it is coming soon.  I have loved this movie since the first time that I saw it.  My mom had even purchased the soundtrack for my sister and I and we learned all the songs including ""Stand Up"".  Polly: Comin' Home is the 2nd movie of the Polly series.

1513402,4,B00005JNF3,"This is a movie that everyone can enjoy. If you like musicals, plays or movies with a true message you'll love it. This movie is a remake of Pollyana staring Haily Mills from the mid to late 60's but with an urban beat. The outline of this movie is about a woman who controls the town by her wealth, but when her niece comes to live with her that little girl turns the town upside down! Once you see it you'll want to watch it again and again. I hope you enjoy it!",1100736000,15,464,4.0

The Plot, The Music, The Heart, it's just one of those FEEL GOOD movies and I can't wait for Disney to show it the Respect and Honor it deserves Releasing a special DVD edition.

I'm 24 now and have been looking for this movie on dvd/vhs for as long as I remember.  I've been very surprised that it hadn't been released sooner.

1513650,5,B00005JNF3,"Polly and Polly coming home are two of the greatest Disney movies I've seen. I don't understand how Disney can basically put every other movie they created on VHS and DVD and not this one. This is a severe oversight on Disney's part.

1513653,5,B00005JNF3,"I think that Polly and Polly:Comin' Home are two movies that have unfortunately been overlooked.  I never saw a store version on VHS, and I hope that they will fix that with DVD versions of each movie.  In my family of 8 kids, everyone from my oldest brother to my youngest sister grew up watching and loving these movies.  I want to someday be able to show them to my kids, especially given the lack of good, wholesome, family-oriented movies out there today.  I, as well, only have distorted taped versions that will not hold up much longer.  I think that anyone who has seen the movies will certainly buy the DVDs, allowing others to be introduced to them for the first time.  I am sure all will fall in love with the films, as so many have already.",1119312000,6,752,4.374100719424461

I had them both on tape but of course they were recorded on.  All I remember from Polly Comin' Home is her stepping out of the car and kicking Jimmy Bean.

I've looked for years for the DVD because it reminds me of my childhood. I am so excited to have it on DVD finally after years of looking for it. Now I just wish Disney would allow anyone to purchase it without joining their club, since you have to also purchase 5 DVDs to complete your membership.

The singing and dancing is so energetic that you watch it over and over again just to learn the words and dance steps.  You not only become involved in the entertaining part of the movie, the story line that one little girl could have such a great, positive impact on so many people is really wonderful for younger audiences to see.  It's one of those rare movies where you don't have to guard the tv the entire time to make sure there is not some part of the movie that a child should not be watching.  I really would love to own this movie again so that my daughter could see it.  I had it a while back on VHS, but the tape popped.",1162425600,4,767,3.9934640522875817
