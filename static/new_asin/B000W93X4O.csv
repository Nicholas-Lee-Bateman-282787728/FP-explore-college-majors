8325832,5,B000W93X4O,"I liked this movie but the visual and audio were disappointing. Still, lots of great song and dance. Wonderful premise of agent wanting to help unknowns and then being blinded by infatuation. I've seen it myself in otherwise intelligent people so it is completely believable. Looking for more by these actors.",1516492800,,309,5.078431372549019
8325833,3,B000W93X4O,"Great to see an early work by the elegant and delightful Sarah Churchill.  Not a bad story line, but marred by sketchy visual and audio quality.  Some of the dialogue just can't be heard.  Uriel Porter, as the character ""George Washington Brown,"" had a magnificent voice.  Too bad he couldn't have made it over to Hollywood; apparently had only a brief career in the U.K.",1461628800,,371,4.661538461538462
