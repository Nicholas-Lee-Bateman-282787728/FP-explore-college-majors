8298563,2,1614448019,"If you are a math professor and want to have an hour break from lecturing, you can use this video as a replacement for a class after integrals have been covered. Or perhaps as the last lecture in a semester AFTER the final exam is given in high school.

The two sides are taken by college professors in mathematics in a college auditorium.  The recording style is like any only college course video. It is the subject matter and perspectives that make this mildly entertaining to a select group of people. The arguments for their respective sides (Derivative vs. Integral) were full of typical college professor humor.  If this type of humor is what you enjoy, then this DVD delivers.  The math-people watching with me did laugh, so it did deliver on that aspect.

To non-math people, this a bad college lecture filled with jokes that cannot be understood. These people will probably not enjoy watching at all.

About the DVD - We only watched the main title. I do not know if there is any menu or ""special features"" on the DVD. Sorry.

This was a gift for a college math professor. She loves it.",1356480000,,1096,4.561224489795919
