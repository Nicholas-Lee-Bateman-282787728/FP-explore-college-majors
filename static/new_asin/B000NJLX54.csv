2769625,5,B000NJLX54,"I purchased this fantastic DVD just from reading the advertising and review.  I absolutely loved it.  Finally my voyeurism was rewarded with, as Tony Comstock so aptly put it, 'real sex.'  I am one of the few people in the world that wonders how anybody 'gets off' on commercially produced porn...it defies my sexual sensibilities.",1186099200,37,331,4.9818181818181815
2769626,5,B000NJLX54,"Tony Comstock is the creator and master of a new genre of films: explicit couples' sexuality documentaries. Comstock states that ""intent to arouse"" is often cited as the dividing line between art and porn. Of all the emotions a director might hope to induce in an audience, arousal remains the last taboo, and Tony Comstock takes it head-on.

I bought all of Comstock's collection at the urgings of the editorial team over at the Feddy & Eddy website.  Comstock is a genius, and Damon and Hunter is my hands-down favorite of all his titles.  For reference, his other titles include Marie and Jack (Comstock's first film, with married pornographic actors), Xana and Dax (an experienced NY blonde and her younger Brazilian lover), Matt & Khym (a 30-something married couple), and Ashley & Kisha (a lesbian couple).  Damon and Hunter is the story of two gay male lovers, and I encourage viewers of any sexual orientation to pick this one up.  I'm a heterosexual female and I can assure you that both my partner and I enjoyed this one.

Damon and Hunter found one another as roommates in New York City, and started a sexual relationship before their romantic one.  One is a Canadian from a family in which they gays outnumber the straights, and the other was raised as a tried-and-true Southern Christian.  In the first half of the film, they discuss their love life, attraction, relationship history, and personal turn-ons in frank terms.  Who actually doesn't enjoy anal action during stimulation?  Was one worried about handling the size of the other?  What are their rules for outside guests in the bedroom?  The second half of the movie is movie is pure intimate action.

The DVD comes complete with a bonus track showing alternate camera angles, including an optional audio commentary from Tony and Peggy Comstock.  The camera angles would be of interest to cinematography students, but for the casual fan, I recommend sticking with the terrific editing job Comstock did for the main film.  The audio commentary contains insights about how Comstock finds his subjects (I guess you can find someone to do anything on Craigslist) and his movie-making strategy.  Buy this film to enjoy again and again, both as a documentary piece and as erotic cinema, and look to the audio commentary and previews of other titles when you want to go deeper.",1176854400,99,2341,4.888607594936709
2769627,5,B000NJLX54,"I recently had the sublime pleasure of being introduced to the erotic and potent films of Tony and Peggy Comstock. Often, porn and erotic features leave me cold, seem fake and mostly seem as if the viewer was spying. I don't like that feeling. But, I decided to give sexy films one more try and for this foray I selected Damon and Hunter, Doing It Together after hearing good things about Comstock Films. I hoped it would be sexy, real, and fun.
And it was.
Damon and Hunter were first of all, beautiful and also hot, loving and honest. Their chemistry was palpable. Their care and adoration for each other, intense.
The way the films are produced also allow the viewer to feel invited into the scene, as if we have permission to share in their pleasure.
I cannot recommend Comstock Films enough. They seem to be films made with honesty and humor and happiness.",1240876800,6,861,4.561290322580645
2769628,3,B000NJLX54,"This film was ok. I saw it once and probably would not watch it again.  It is primarily a interview juxtaposed with clips of a sex scene.  This is not porn, but the final scene is pretty hot.",1232582400,2,191,4.0
2769629,4,B000NJLX54,"This modest documentary on real-life adult stars Damon & Hunter left me wanting to know even more about them. It was refreshing to catch their takes on love, sex, backgrounds, how they met, etc., and treat them as real people, not just fantasy figures paid to hit their marks on film.
The actual sex at the end is genuinely sweet & passionate, but it's the affectionate vibes between Damon & Hunter during the interview segments that somehow stoke the fire. These are two appealing & heartfelt young men, and I wish them all the best in their life together.",1230940800,7,557,4.636363636363637
2769630,5,B000NJLX54,"The first time I watched this film in the privacy of my home I was surprised by the sheer eroticism of it, or at least my reaction to it - it's a wonderfully sexy film. The second time I saw it I was in polite company in a packed cinema, during a film festival, where it was very well received. Damon and Hunter Doing: It Together has played on my DVD player plenty of times since...

The film has all the hallmarks of Comstock's best work - an enchanting interview with a charming couple followed by a beautifully filmed explicit visit to their bedroom. Like his other films, this one provides the viewer with a glimpse into intimacy rarely seen on the screen. I highly recommend it.",1230940800,4,684,4.3858267716535435
2769631,3,B000NJLX54,"While there are some nice bits in this work, don't expect it to give you any revelations on intimacy or providing pleasure to your partner. The format is better than average, yet it remains a pornographic film with the usual conventions (oral stimulation, mutual frotting, penetration, pumping, grimacing and the all-important ""money shot.""

This couple is not typical of the gay couples I know and love. Not a word is spoken during the action, the interviews reveal that the couple is neither monogamous nor inexperienced in the ""adult film industry,"" and while they exchange a few kisses during the action, there is little revealed loving passion. They do have a few good things to say in the interspersed interviews about intimacy, and mention a couple of points about boundaries, but the focal point is the hot action.

Of course, true lovers are poor subjects for erotic filming. They spend a great deal more time petting and touching before having sex, arousing one another to the point where libido takes control. They exchange endearments, say silly things like ""I love feeling your fingers on my spine"" and often have serious lip-lock while coupling in the missionary position, the side-rear leg-over position, or the leg-grab pump from below position.

They also tend to reach orgasm with a slow, deliberate approach, ensuring maximum pleasure, and often reaching simultaneous climax. And while they hardly shout "" la porno"" when release comes, they generally have a few words to say or moans to gasp as it overwhelms their nervous system.

The intimacy of denouement is missing - the relaxed caresses and fremissements so important as the boil goes off, the warmth remaining. ""Stay inside me a while"" is never mentioned - but I guess when there's latex involved, it may be repugnant. Oh yeah - they had to do the money shot, so I guess it wasn't an option.

Yet, stay this criticism !! - it must be almost impossible to find a gay couple willing to reveal their most intimate moments, tell a camera how they felt after committing to one another, having the blood tests, and making love for the first time free of latex and fear.

None of that here - just a couple of cute guys making it on a mattress on the floor in the corner of a room, saying a few things about a relationship that somehow doesn't quite ring true, following the directions of the guy with the camera and trying to make it look as ""real"" as possible.

Three stars for the attractive erotica and the attempt at least to present something other than the usual bump and grind stuff. Besides - it's cheaper than avowed porn; but you probably won't retrieve this short film from your library for a long time after a first viewing.",1221177600,16,2705,4.754797441364605
2769632,5,B000NJLX54,"I loved how the movie went from the couple talking about their relationship; how they met,their first impressions of each other, and when they first did 'it' . To hot sexy love scenes, I appreciated having a context for those hot moments between them.

Comstock and his wife did great camera work. The camera danced between the graphic close ups to the intense and orgasmic facial expressions. The graphic portion of the film seem to have a more artful side to it then I'm used to seeing in male porn.

It's so refreshing to see love and sex portrayed on porn. But I have a hard time calling this movie porn because it's not cheap meaningless sex. It's sex inside of a loving relationship. If you like sensual and erotic I think you will love this.",1212883200,9,748,4.492647058823529
2769633,5,B000NJLX54,"Damon and Hunter ""Doing It"" proved to be what I thought--and a little more.  I wanted to know a little about the adult film industry and the people who work in it, so I ordered this DVD. When it arrived, I wasn't surprised by the graphic sexual content as much as the two ""normal"" guys performing here. I recommend this to guys (or girls) who want a little insight and a little eye-opener.",1202428800,16,389,4.328767123287672
2769634,2,B000NJLX54,Did not enjoy the DVD. Not into cheap thrills. No story line and heard the same story over and over. It gives the feel of two friend telling their story on home video. Poor.,1196553600,,173,4.117647058823529
2769635,4,B000NJLX54,"this video was intriguing based on shock value. sex is always riveting on on a non-porn level, but this could have been ""art-ed"" up a bit. pretty bare bones (no pun intended). but sufficient based on the criteria on which i purchased it.",1192579200,2,237,4.534883720930233
2769636,5,B000NJLX54,"""Damon and Hunter: Doing It Together"" is a real surprise - a documentary film about sex that manages to be as fascinating during the interview as it is erotic during the sex. These two are so into each other, their interaction so intimate, that the interview is just as compelling as the sex itself -- and believe me, the sex is pretty great. I watched this with a grin on my face (or was that a flush?) In any case, it's totally refreshing, and a unique genre: a film about attractive, interesting, REAL people and sex.",1190592000,30,520,4.427083333333333
8178375,2,B000NJLX54,"A expose of a porn couple and their lives that is not done so well. The editors try and make this all about their lives and careers and try and bate the viewer with talks about the couple starting to have sex as the film is ending. Basically they will do anything to make it into something its not.

Hunter was a hell of a performer in his days had the looks and the body but even that can't save this sad piece of work.",1412812800,,420,3.9411764705882355
8178376,5,B000NJLX54,"I'll be honest too. I purchased it to see an amateur sex scene between two hot men. However, it's more than that. I believe these guys are talking from their hearts. It doesn't feel scripted. It's just two guys talking about their lives and saying ""Hey! This is us and our lives."" Thank you for allowing us inside.",1363996800,,314,4.431034482758621
8178377,3,B000NJLX54,"Cheap porn.  Not well produced.  Rather vanilla.  However, the guys are fairly good looking.  It's just a chintzy production. I was sorry I bought it.",1363046400,,150,4.88
8178378,1,B000NJLX54,"This DVD sat in my Saved Items list for over a year, until the price dropped enough to make it worth the risk. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews, but how was I to know? There just is not anything about this movie to recommend. Damon and Hunter are not interesting at all, there is no discernible affection between them, and they are a lot less attractive than they look on the DVD cover. The blurb on the back calls them ""rising adult stars,"" but if so I fear their stars will not rise much farther than this. If I'd wanted to watch boring, shallow, unattractive men have sex I could have done that online for free.",1303862400,,639,4.289256198347108
8178379,4,B000NJLX54,I watched this DVD with interest and found that the two guys were very honest and devoyed to each other. I had noy previously viewed a video like this but enjoyedit. As for the other videos that are done by same director they too were of very similar content and also found them to be very well made and produced. I recomend all of these movies. Very erotic.,1289865600,,358,4.279411764705882
8178380,1,B000NJLX54,"I was expecting something completely different.  The story between the two guys was not interesting, both guys are feminine and neither of them are attractive.  Save your money.  If you're looking for romance or a good story, there's lots of other titles to choose from.  If you're looking for porn, you can find free stuff on the internet much better.",1267747200,3,352,4.816666666666666
8178381,1,B000NJLX54,"Foolishly, I'd expected something better when I purchsed this film. Sadly, it is a self indulgent, tedious bore. The astonishing arrogance of the participants to think that anybody would want to watch them in action, over and over again. Cute and interesting they ain't!",1265587200,,270,5.159090909090909
8178382,5,B000NJLX54,"First, in case you are unaware of the format of Comstock Films' productions, they are split into two parts. The first part of the film is an interview with a couple, where they discuss their the ins, outs, and history of their relationship. Interspersed throughout the interview are short, 3-10 second long clips of the couple having sex. The second part of the film is the full, uninterrupted sex scene.

Second, I dare you to not develop a crush on these two. They are charming, adorable, and oh so hot. I liked pretty much everything about them. The interview is engaging and Damon and Hunter are great on camera. You get to hear them talk about how they met, how they waited a long time before introducing outside parties to their relationship, and how even then they only have do it with other people together. Also, it was very nice to hear a rural coming out story where nothing bad happened.

I'd recommend this to straight folks and lesbians who are interested in watching how two guys actually get it on. I'd recommend this to gay men who want their sex on film to have a serious back story. I'd recommend this, pretty much, to everybody.",1258502400,3,1148,4.567961165048544
8178383,1,B000NJLX54,"I found this movie to be more of documentary than anything else, I wasn't that impressed with it. If you haven't purchased the movie don't waste your money.",1256256000,,156,4.607142857142857
8178384,4,B000NJLX54,"At first I wasn't sure if I liked the DVD or not because I was put off by how not attractive the two men are but as I continued watching they got better looking and it made the whole experience more exciting; to say the least. Its definitely worth it, if your a curious person or just plain into this type of thing. I particularly like the interview as the two men are talking about how they met, and what being 'gay' means to them and whatnot. Its very enlightening and I'm glad I purchased this because I was curious and I did indeed learn from it; and enjoyed it as well.",1242950400,5,574,4.133928571428571
