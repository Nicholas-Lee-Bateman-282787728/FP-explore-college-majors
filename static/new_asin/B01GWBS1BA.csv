8763700,5,B01GWBS1BA,"DIE ANOTHER DAY in retrospect is classic Bond. It is the last Bond film to follow the Bond formula when you actually think about it. Pierce Brosnan is James Bond in DIE ANOTHER DAY and it is truly old school in many respects. It seems to play better these days now that it is over 10 years old. There is something nostalgic about it. It looks to the past for its inspiration. I never thought I would be saying that about this film. There are so many good scenes and elements to this film that I just overlook some of its imperfect moments. But then again, what is perfect? I enjoy it. It was my dad's last Bond film before he left us and he enjoyed it to my amazement. Pierce really had the Bond character down by this point and I was sad that it was his last. And I like David Arnold's score too. This was a 40th Anniversary film and it really paid homage to the series.

DIE ANOTHER DAY is the last Bond film from the cinematic Bond universe that started with DR. NO. The next film in the series, CASINO ROYALE, was a re-boot of the series. Thus, DIE ANOTHER  DAY is the last of a formula that was started by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman back in 1962. Being the 40th Anniversary film, it calls upon props and images reminiscent and actually seen in the previous films. For instance, we see Irma Bunt's steel blade tipped shoes from FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and other props from THUNDERBALL, OCTOPUSSY and the like. Other images call upon scenes inspired from DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. Look for them! Some of DIE ANOTHER DAY is a bit over the top, but then so was DR. NO. Even though Ian Fleming's creation was based on espionage and covert intelligence gathering, Fleming often interjected elements of the fantastic into his stories and especially into the personas of his villains. DIE ANOTHER DAY is a fitting end to the Cold War era and the original cinematic Bond character that traversed and thrived in that world.",1510099200,,1935,4.402234636871508
