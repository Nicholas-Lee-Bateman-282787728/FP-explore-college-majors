7947468,5,B00005NKU2,"A wonderful composite biography of a master of comedy that dominated television in the 1960's and 1970's. Paul Lynde is exposed here for both his acheivements and failures, showing a dark brooding side of him, his homosexuality, his midwest roots, his search for happiness that escaped him most of his life until his last years and all his glories and acclaim as a comedian and actor. I found this video to be very interesting in learning more of his Ohio roots, his days at Northwestern University, and his early show business years. I also found him to be a more troubled and tormented man than I had ever thought him to represent. He was so beloved in vehicles like Bewitched and
Hollywood Squares. His many friendships and those that he lost thru drinking or bitterness were clearly overshadowed by those who loved him despite his problems. Many good scenes of Paul acting in this video that give you a feel for the depth of his comedic talent and reach. A great timeline is built here with Peter Graves narrarating. You will come away with the full picture of Paul Lynde and his showcased talents. I liked the biography a great deal and can hardly wait until a film or TV movie version is done on Paul Lynde. This was a truly funny man and one of Greta Garbo's favorites!",1024099200,2,1276,4.576419213973799
