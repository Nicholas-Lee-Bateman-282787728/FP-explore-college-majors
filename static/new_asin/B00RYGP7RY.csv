6936523,1,B00RYGP7RY,This is the worst movie that I have ever seen.  I bought it because the other reviewers talked so well of the 3D experience.  I felt that the 3D was terrible and felt cheated.  The movie made no sense.  The sound was bad and it had no plot or story line.  It is the only movie that I have purchased that has a booklet to explain the movie.  The movie should stand on its on merits.  I hate that I wasted my money buying this film.,1431475200,4,430,3.9302325581395348
6936524,1,B00RYGP7RY,"I saw this at AFI Silver's 3D festival.

Worst.
3D film.
Ever.

Worst French film I have ever seen, more like an SNL parody of bad French Films.

Everything about the 3D was bad with parallax shifts, too close and too far at the same time and ROTATING the parallax 90 degrees.

Literally the best part of the film was a man pooping, frequently, while talking to a woman, who often was naked.

Notably, Godard's dog was in the film. Best line was ""I think this dog is depressed.""

No kidding.

The French have a word for this - merde.",1430870400,4,533,4.27
6936525,5,B00RYGP7RY,"Watching this movie in the cinema was a visually fascinating experience, even though I mostly didn't quite grasp what Godard was getting at with the actual 'content' of the film. I have to say I pretty much disliked his somewhat similar previous film, the tedious ""Film Socialisme"" (even though it had my hero Patti Smith in it). But this time he had managed to come up with a selection of images and edits and weird lo-fi effects that was consistently interesting. It's a cool showcase for what you can ALSO do with 3D, outside of the mainstream. It's recommended along with two other good 3D art movies, Werner Herzog's ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"" and Wim Wenders' ""Pina"".

(this is not a review of the blu ray, I have to say the movie is almost 100% dependent on the 3D stuff, so watching it on a TV set-up with less that satisfactory 3D is bound to be disappointing)",1430265600,4,869,4.535031847133758
6936526,4,B00RYGP7RY,"This new Godard film will be of immense interest to fans and critics.  An average filmgoer will find it mystifying.  It is shot in 3-D, sometimes to amazing effect.  At other times, however, it is used to jar the narrative.  Images overlap; one camera is covered, then the other.  Beautiful images become confused and blurred.  Sometimes we cut to black, even though the actors continue to speak.  The narrative proceeds by ellipses.  In other words, there are breaks in the temporal progression of the story.  Men and women are in difficult relationships; sometimes they speak; sometimes they are mesmerized by the images on their cell phones.  At one moment we see people and boats, harbors, trees, flowers and floating leaves.  Then we see Hitler.  Then we see trees.

The controlling or central presence is a dog named Roxy.  Since Roxys language is limited, her presence connects directly with the films title.  The message is ultimately Rousseauan (I think).  Society/government corrupts; we need to have more direct, more emotional connections with nature and with each other.  The vehicle for expressing these sentiments is ultra avant-garde cinema, in which all of our normal modes of aesthetic perception are disrupted.

David Bordwell says that Godard (now into his 80s) is the youngest filmmaker working today.  In other words, he is the most innovative, the most imaginative and creative.

Bottom line: devotees and scholars will find this hypnotic; average filmgoers will find it challenging.  Some will find it excruciating.  I was disappointed in that some elements of avant-garde filmmaking continue to be influenced by Freud, even at a time when Freud is seen, variously, as a poet, a philosopher, or a fraud, but not as a scientist.  I had hoped for some reflections on language that took into account contemporary philosophic and neuroscientific examinations of the unique nature of consciousness (including its presence in creatures like Roxy), inflected, perhaps by Wittgensteinian notions of language games and the relationships between language and knowledge.  This film is not really about that.  Philosophically and psychologically it is more old fashioned, despite the technological and narratological innovations that drive it.

Godard fans and film historians/critics: don't miss.  The rest of you: caveat emptor.  One of the interesting aspects of the film is that part of it is shot in Godards actual home (and many of  the jarring images/sounds were not revealed to the actors during the shoot), so that all students of the creative process will find things in it of interest.",1429228800,7,2608,5.231884057971015
6936527,5,B00RYGP7RY,"Well hello there, Mr. Jean-Luc Godard. Where've you been the past few decades? I've missed you and your style, old friend. I'm glad you decided to embrace some of modern technology for your latest artistic endeavor. It was quite a ride, short but sweet, as they say.

Indeed, Godard's ""Goodbye to Language 3D"" is a visual and aural masterpiece that brings him back to his roots. The King of Avant Garde has returned, and with him he has brought a colorful and fiery rage upon the world of cinema.

Godard masterfully uses modern 3D technology to tell his romantic story, and does it in the most unique way I've ever seen. Some of the scenes have parts where one character will move off-camera, but the camera still follows that character while staying focused on another character in another part of the shot. I realized that this was an extremely clever use of the 3D glasses, in that one image is projected in one eye, and a completely different one is projected in the other, giving the viewer a beautiful blended double view of what's happening, rather than going ""old school"" and making all these scenes split-screen. It really was a clever and gorgeous technique that I particularly appreciated.

Naturally, Godard prefers to use imagery and sounds in his film to tell the story, rather than heavy dialogue that hands the plot to the audience on a silver platter. The plot is rather simplistic, but when Godard executes this story in his own style, it becomes one of the most breathtaking experiences of my life.

The film is extremely short at 69 minutes with credits, but that doesn't mean it's not worth your time in the least. I really couldn't see the story taking much longer to unfold, and the imagery and scenes scattered throughout the film will entrance you to the point where you won't care about the length, you'll just want to experience it all over again. Welcome back, Mr. Godard. I hope you're here to stay- I've missed you for so long.",1429056000,9,1958,4.683139534883721
6936528,4,B00RYGP7RY,"I have the British pressing of this film in 3D.  The two lengthy reviews below describe the film in a much more esoteric manner than I would even think of using for a simple review of the film.  This is NOT a film for the average movie-goer - it is as the reviews below suggest a film for people interested in Godard's films and his film-making - and for those interested in the presented aspects and methods used by the filmmaker to express his ideas.  If you are looking at this film for any other reason, except perhaps for 3D techniques; then I would see if I could rent it - but not purchase it as you will be disappointed.
I am a 3D enthusiast - as some of you know by my reviews.  The 3D in this film is wonderfully expressionistic.  It DOES present images in front of the window frame - quite a lot of them in fact - which makes this film for 3D lovers a very welcome film.  The use of color, and framing to a great extent, is very well thought out and really fun.
There are a few sound issues - I know that the sudden lack of sound and distortion is purposefully placed in the film - but you WILL think that your equipment is faulty at times and that is very annoying (and not really necessary to the film).
So, I guess I am saying that the film is great for technique and thought.  And, great for 3D usage.  But for simply watching an entertaining movie - well, for the intellectual.  I love this type of movie when I feel like watching a movie that I want to dissect and discuss.  This is not the movie to watch when you simply want to be entertained after a long, hard stressful day when the mind is looking for simple relaxation.",1427587200,16,1642,4.151419558359621
6936529,5,B00RYGP7RY,"Five lingering impressions:

1) The 3D tech erases the usual boundary between screen image and audience. The images are no longer on the screen, they are all around you. You are no longer simply an observer, you are a part of the visual landscape of the film.....you float within it image and concept field.

2) While there is a ship in this film that recalls the Costa Concordia in Film Socialism its a much smaller ship (a ferry) and its seems to carry much less symblic weight: History is evoked in this film but it is not evoked nearly as often as it is in the previous film. In both films Godard likes to move back and forth between the macro and the micro, but here he seems much more interested in the micro...in the effects of History, of Language, of Cinema, of Literature (of totalizing mechanisms/schemes) on the personal.

3) In Film Socialism there was a llama. In Goodbye to Language there is a dog. In FS the llama had a mere cameo. In GTL the dog is the star (b/c the dog is beyond language, b/c the dog is the only creature that sees things as they are or so says the Alphavillian voiceover).

4) Godard is fond of absurdist set pieces. My favorite one in GTL features ""Mary Shelley"" as she writes Frankenstein. We've seen the players in this set piece as civilians earlier on in the film so when this set piece begins we know we are supposed to view these characters as actors acting in a period film. My description of it will not do it justice. Suffice it to say that the book (Frankenstein) stands as a testament to man's endless (and tragic) need/willingness to delude himself.....with poetry, with politics..... I love this set piece b/c Godard finds so much humor in it......in both man's appetite for delusion and for his concomitant need to feel sorry for himself and mourn his own sorry state.........Godard's humor is an endless resource, its what makes him seem so much younger than any other filmmakers/artists of this or any other age.

5)  The funniest line is when an older professor (who is featured within another absurdist set piece) tells two kids about to depart for the USA to introduce the Americans to philosophy..... its especialy funny b/c the humor is not just directed at the Americans here, its also directed at the self-serious Europeans.....

This is certainly the funniest Godard I've ever seen and would serve nicely as a final film (even though I hope its not).  It will be easy to read this film as a kind of swan song and its especially endearing b/c there is so much love of looking and of thinking and of cinema in it. It almost feels like one of those 3D greeting cards that reaches out to you as you open it up. It works as a comment on our post-verbal/post-cerebral world but it never really strikes a mournful note (or I should say that when it does so it does so in an ironic way), after all Godard is a visual artist and he thinks visually and one feels in every frame that he loves the age into which he was born.....and that the visual medium (so resistant to precise thought, precise theories, precise philosophies) he has spent his life with is the very thing that has permitted him to remain so fluid for so long. The ""goodbye"" can simply be read as his goodbye to all of the languages he has so enjoyed, and that have so illumined his days. You could also say that the film is not so much a goodbye to film and other kinds of languages but a meditation on his particular relationship with those languages. (I think the Swiss word for goodbye also mean hello).",1427328000,12,3526,4.481308411214953
6936530,5,B00RYGP7RY,"On 1st viewing of Godard's Goodbye to Language,you have no narrative,just a man and a woman,later a dog. There is repetition;and the use of a new technique,3D,without rules,to show how a child or animal sees the world,with the use of primary colours in spring or autumn,or colours drenched ,bleeding out of the object. He uses heavy inter-titles like `Nature' or ` Metaphor'. Godard wants to go beyond language, while paying homage to words at the same time. He quotes lavishly many writers,poets,thinkers,philosophers,painters; plays the work of different musicians, where the music plays then goes dead. Alternatively, the screen goes black while people are speaking or music is still playing. Godard wants to have no preconceptions,just see through his lens the world nakedly, reflecting the world through these new techniques. We wander in forests,look up at trees,see the beauty of flowers, roam with a dog by a lakeside or as it rolls in snow,or in urban settings focus on a chair in the foreground. Subject: the idea is simple: a married woman and a single man meet. They love,they argue,fists fly. A dog strays between town and country. The seasons pass. The man and woman meet again. The dog finds itself between them. The other is in one,the one is in the other and they are three. The former husband shatters everything. A 2nd film begins:the same as the 1st, and yet not. From the human race we pass to metaphor. This ends in barking and a baby's cries.

Freud and the art of film began at the start of the 20th century:they both in some ways are parallel developments, exploring reality, based on new techniques. Godard shows us perception and consciousness, how an animal's eyes are unclouded by consciousness. Godard shows human beings weighed down by interpretations,needing interpretation .He uses 3D film in this baffling experimental drama, turning the technology on its head(no car chases,nor animated dragons or objects hurling towards the screen) by using his 3rd dimension to send contrasting images to each of the viewer's eyes or-in one particular haunting sequence-to add spatial depth to the sight of a man sitting on a toilet, pooping. This is a kind of equality we all share. The idea that existence is about trying to reconcile the ""real"" world with the subjective experience of the world, and the names and notions we use to catalogue and define the world--but the digressions are what make it sing. ""I will barely say a word,"" says a voice on the soundtrack--maybe Godard?--adding, ""I am looking for poverty in language."" While the film is drenched in the rich sensual experience of Godard's visual language. An interesting motif is images of running water, water lapping shores of a lake, sea water, a river in full spate, rain falling, even the water of a shower: the importance of water in the origin myths of heroes, and dreams linked to childbirth.

Speech no longer exists: the analogue I of storytelling has disappeared into cyberspace. Images are fractured,dispersed from the organic, subjective,narrative whole. In 35 mm cinema the image came with the sound. Godard is saying goodbye to his own way of speaking which cinema still allows. We can still create a mix of images and words. We can feel, hear what is outside the frame. We can escape from the rules, from ideas: then the story is simple, a man, a woman and a dog, and to be understood you repeat it, keeping the dog to restore the balance. Godard foresees a future when people will be told by technology what to think and feel. In Goodbye Godard gives light and sound an exhilarating sense of renewal-abstracting reality : actions off screen are suggested by sounds, faces are cut out of the frame, sounds distorted through constant modulations and tonal shifts. Reality through imagination by the poet of cinema. He is on the side-lines,reflecting the modern world through philosophy and technology. With the loss of words( 'lost in the forest or in Africa or with the animals or the poor... or the mentally impaired or the homeless. But language no longer exists. So there is something else, it conjures up other images.').

He quotes Monet as painting what he doesn't see. We as human spectators,look at the observable universe. To scientists,numbers and the laws of science are real,independent entities,but they are constructions of human thought attempting to seize something of the universe. There is no transcendent perspective,we are dreamers. We can only really see ourselves when we are looking into another person's eyes. The camera captures everything it sees-we passively like the camera comply-and yet not seeing anything. As though Godard is making the movie for the camera and for the sake of the film itself. There are no conventions of plot or character. One of the characters says she ""hates characters"". Density, compression, digression,montage are utilised freely. Lettered Texts are printed on top of each other or over images. We get ideas tossed at us like Hitler's rise to power coincided with the invention of TV, or will Russia ever be a part of Europe,without ceasing to be Russia? That a new Godard film is an event, something that may better be seen in an art gallery:already distribution in the UK by Studiocanal has folded and it's been rushed to DVD. This is a shame as the full 3D experience can only be gained in a movie theatre. In Goodbye, Godard's use of 3D is a matter of using the screen (with its illusory extra dimension of depth) as a multimedia space in the true sense: he's creating both a painting and a sculpture. Obscure,maddening, obsessed with history and cinema. In a word: awesome!",1423612800,32,5635,4.9482576557550155

6936532,2,B00RYGP7RY,"I bought this mostly to experience the ""split-screen"" effect everyone was raving about, where the two 3D cameras split apart to follow, say, two different characters in a scene so that the viewer is seeing two completely different (flat) images, one in each eye, rather than one combined 3D image. An effect one reviewer seeing the film in a theater described as: ""I felt like as though trying to process it might possibly detach my retinas"" and another as: ""It doesnt feel like the screens splitting  it feels like your head has just expanded a rung or two up the evolutionary ladder."" I was so excited to see this -- and so, so, disappointed to discover that the 3D Blu-ray disc does not contain this effect. Instead, in the scenes where the effect would appear, you just see a single, static image, same in each eye. It is baffling to me why this much-talked about, innovative use of 3D which was used in theaters was NOT included in the 3D disc version of the film.

Unfortunately unlike the 100+ other 3D BD's I own, this movie gave me a headache after about 20 minutes.  It's not unique, its horrible dribble, that continues on and on mindlessly like grinding transmission gears.  Literally,  It's the best analogy I can come up with.  Its painful, almost to the point of physical pain.  Even the nudity was nauseating and meaningless.  It's only my opinion, but I've watched a lot of movies, everything from Mama MIa to Ben Hur, Humanoids from the deep to Saving Private Ryan.  I thought I had seen the best and the worst of what cinema has offered so far.  I was wrong.  I don't know what kind of disability or controlled substance an individual must possess to be able to sit through this entire ""feature"".

6936537,3,B00RYGP7RY,"I have no end of admiration for Jean-Luc Godard, regarding his earlier career, but he seems, of late, trying to challenge the imagination and intelligence of his viewer. ""Filme Socialisme"" was a borefest, and I thought the sweet man was descending into some abyss of esoterica that would either challenge the most compulsive film freak to challenge his own sensibility, or to just love the man for whom he is.

It was with trepidation that I watched ""Goodbye to Language"", a somewhat more sensible ""narrative"", but has been said in simpler ways. As the title implies, it's about man's incapability to successfully communicate. In this case, it's about a man and woman at odds with various relationships. The abysmal setting of the whole thing didn't work for me. Sorry. ""Blue Valentine"" said pretty much the same thing. Sad, but more powerful.

The fact that it was in 3-D was interesting, though I didn't watch it that way. The Blu transfer was good.

What remains is an experimental film that, quite simply, wasn't entertaining. The extras, including an extensive interview with with the maestro Godard. There was so much more to pay attention to than in ""Filme Socialisme"", where a 10 minute scene of a tied-up donkey got really tired, really fast...and so slow.

I'm so bored lately when people say ""for the discriminating viewer"". That's crap.

Film should enlighten, and entertain. Those days of esoteric thoughts, hippie-esque attitude, and thoughts of this-world or other, were explored ad nauseum in the 60's. Now, Godard wants to re-live that. It's simply not necessary.

Though un-nerving, it is an effective way of showing two realities simultaneously.  You'll either watch a little of the film and go ""yuch!"" or you'll go back and re-watch several times.  You'll like it ... or you'll hate it.  I'm pretty sure I'm in the ""like it"" camp ... pretty sure.",1453161600,3,740,4.771653543307087
8696314,4,B00RYGP7RY,"As a 3D TV owner who doesn't want to own boring movies, I don't have a whole lot of 3D blu-rays in my collection. Gravity and Fury Road (two movies which use the effect to impress a feeling of vastness and infinity on the stage where all the events of the film transpire) are both present and accounted for, of course; so are all the big-budget studio extravaganzas like the Lego movie and (a select few of) the Marvel movies.

And then this movie.

This movie approaches the 3D technology of ensuring that different eyes receive different images in a whole new way, to create depth in places where most movies (to borrow a phrase from Dr. Billy Packer) don't even have places, and most intriguingly to layer images of contrasting action to show twice as much stuff going on at once. It does plenty of cool fly-at-your-face 3D too, but that's not the reason you'll be bringing this out to show off your system to people - it's to see all the other stuff it does. I found the moments of technique to be far more interesting and sustaining than the plot, but the whole package was such a unique unit of entertainment that I was fully kept aloft and engaged over the full running time.

If you've got the hardware, this is a must-buy even if you find it somewhat counfounding. You just gotta muscle through and wait for the cool stuff to happen; buy this movie with the same drive that a SACD collector owes it to themselves to seek out those Talk Talk reissues.",1452297600,7,1459,4.436567164179104
8696315,5,B00RYGP7RY,"The 3D is amazing. Best I've seen and I love 3D. Many images pop out of the tv. There's also stunning clarity and depth. There's a street scene where it looks like the road is coming out of the TV. The car windshield as shown from inside the car appears to contour the TV screen, making you feel like you're inside the car. A film for 3D lovers to be in awe over.",1449014400,2,363,3.9863013698630136
