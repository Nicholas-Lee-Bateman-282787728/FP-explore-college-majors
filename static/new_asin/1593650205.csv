7799646,4,1593650205,"This account of three Polish mathematical pioneers working on Nazi codes dates from 1979.  There are English subtitles, but it was not always easy to follow.  Nevertheless, it does present important facts about work ""Enigma"" that predated the now-famous Bletchley Park.  Significantly, this included devices to test different settings of the machine long before Turing's device (in ""The Imitation Game"") came into being.  I am glad that these mostly-unsung heroes had a documentary made, and this represents good value for the price.",1475539200,,533,5.463414634146342
7799647,3,1593650205,"Additional confirmation of Poland's sacrifices and invaluable contribution to the War effort. Film, however, was needlessly slow-paced and  monotonous. These heroes deserve better.",1470009600,,180,6.826086956521739
7799648,5,1593650205,"Very good film, docudrama style, the guy who played Hitler looked creepy enough. The film was done in an accurate, matter of way. I could not view it with English subtitles on my TV but did so on my computer.",1427932800,,208,4.225
7799649,5,1593650205,"This is one of the only films that presents the much-needed Polish history of decrypting the Enigma.  For English speakers it may be a bit difficult to follow, since the French, Germans, British and American characters are possibly easily identified by nuances of the Polish accent which is impossible to translate into English subtitles.  Watch it for the Polish perspective which does not adequately appear elsewhere and a few digs at the British and Americans.  Ignore the props that purport to show the Enigma and the Polish ""Bombe"".  The portrayal of both a stage performer parodying Hitler and Hitler himself are both by the same actor in the same persona which is a bit distracting. But be patient and I think you'll enjoy this freshly different view of the beginning of the breaking of the Enigma code.",1414454400,2,810,4.890510948905109
7799650,5,1593650205,"This movie should be of interest to fans of the history of intelligence services, of WWII, or of Alan Turing and the development of electronic computers.  It's the Polish version of how Blexley Park was able to break the Enigma Code.  It also shows how you can't believe the American movie version of history.  I can confirm from other sources that this version is correct.  The movie is in Polish with English subtitles.",1381795200,,421,4.726027397260274
7799651,3,1593650205,"plot: Polish cryptologists BREAK the secret Nazi Cypher Machine known as Enigma~

POLISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES

3 hours~ in 2 parts

Part one~ 1939 just before the Nazi invasion of Poland~ has the POLISH Cypher Section getting ahold of several NAZI CYPHER MACHINES KNOWN AS *ENIGMA* WHICH MEANS RIDDLE /PUZZLE. This machine which could pass as a typewriter was being used by the Nazis to pass on TOP secret coded messages. using several Wheels and a keyboard and ""light up board"" the ENDLESS combination make it nearly impossible to break the codes which were changed DAILY. But the Polish know invasion is just a matter of time and having obtained several machines duplicated them and finally were able to BREAK the codes now they are busy ""listing"" to the Nazi Communications. we see a brief glimpse into the personal lives of the two two cyper experts but soon they are moving into *hiding* and moving to Romania to escape the Nazi invasion.

Part two: Moving from Rumania and to FRANCE they end up capture and sent to prison.

This is a good movie the interesting intelligent Polish Cypher Bureau is facinating. But this could have been a GREAT 2 hour movie and moved a long faster. it drags especially in part 2.

WE do get to see the GERMANS including HITLER speaking in polish which is both amusing and entertaining. the polish actors are quite good. SETS and costumes are VERY good but what this lacks is PLOT. We are quickly loose interest because we want to see MORE information about the ENIGMA not the sad polish cypher agents who end up captive mostly due to idiots every step of the way who simply feel they were of no value. WE have to fully CREDIT the polish for SOLVING~ THE CODES AND SHARING THE MACHINES~  which plainly help the BRITS and eventually Americans KNOW what the Nazis were up too. I give this 3 out of 5 for intesting movie WORTH WATCHING ONCE.
ALSO WHAT MADE THIS VERY SAD WAS HOW LITTLE THE ALLIES DID TO HELP THE CYPHER TEAM ESCAPE.

** THIS MAY HELP** most foreign movies have a *LANGUAGE SET BUTTON ** ON THE DVD MENU

THIS LACKS THAT. I had to spend some time and eventually used MY DVD *REMOTE CONTROL* AND USE LANGUAGE SET UP AND THEN ENGLISH ** FOR THE ENGLISH SUBTILES TO BE VISIBLE.

also see Engima with Tom Jerico and Kate Winslet which is a more entertaining movie.",1329955200,2,2311,4.546987951807229
