8627418,4,B00GTSVN12,"Grindhouse, in your face, race-exploitation doesn't get any more abrasive than this grimy feature. The story, with its many unexplored themes about race and truly dysfunctional marital problems, is more of a platform to thrust a police procedural into the viewer's face with more racist epithets and violence than your'd find in your average 42nd Street dope-den of a cinema. Some great action scenes and shootouts are effective, and the performances--wtih the exception of a few giggling hillbillies here and there--are fine. Aaron Stielstra creates a soundtrack of early 80s horror and dementia unheard of since the days of William Lustig's ""Maniac"" and early John Carpenter. A very satisfying guilty pleasure for those who don't feel much guilt over watching racist cops and one nasty serial killer do battle in super-saturated glory.",1435968000,,837,5.348484848484849
8627419,5,B00GTSVN12,"Bought this on a whim, and it paid off.  Very dark and funny, sometimes scary but more over the top exploitation, like a Tarantino movie that doesn't take itself so seriously.  I really liked it, the killer was funny/scary, like Freddy Krueger and the whole mood of the movie feels like a cool old grindhouse film.  A Must buy.",1398470400,,327,4.508474576271187
