426734,3,6302130948,This double feature is ok. It is a bit dated (1990's) and some of the information has been denounced in the last 20 years. Not to mention the narrator seems in a hurry to get from one case to the next. Overall it is a good introductory miece for those interested in the how what and why certain actors died over the years.,1347840000,,322,4.126984126984127
426735,4,6302130948,"When the Applause Died: I accidentally purchased this - thinking there was much on here about Jim Morrison of the doors. As I recall - there was about 15 to 20 seconds about him, on that I was disappointed. In some ways I agree with the first review on here - a very cheaply made - low-budget documentary. It starts off back in the days of Fatty Arbuckle(sp?). Then it talks about one celebrity after another, with regards to alcoholism and drug addiction. It is very slow in the beginning and picks up speed. Talks of Alflafa from the Little Rascals, other child and older movie stars. To me this is a very sobering documentary of addiction, and it does not even touch many celebs. It is staggering (no pun meant) in how deep the problems of stars can be. Most in this video died from their addictions. One that I see they missed is Love Addiction, which has plagued so many.
I would add - this is Not a cheery film. It is tragic and on the morbid side.
I later bought a copy of it on DVD, and comes with another similar film (I forget the title off-hand).  So, if someone is interested in addiction and celebrities -and perhaps wants a sobering look at how addictions can ruin a life, - for a low-budget movie - I recommend this documentary.

426736,5,6302130948,"Wow, still creepy!! I first saw ""Death In Hollywood"" when it came out in the early 90's with my Dad and all I can say is that the stories and images have stuck with me for a long time. A lot of stars from the old days might not be of interest to the ""Power Rangers"" generation but this thing is worth the price of admission just for the Vic Morrow footage alone. E's True Hollywood Story about ""The Twilight Zone Movie"" incident didn't show you the actual footage of the actors demise but this early 90's documentary does, from multiple angles at that. The George Reeves story doesn't run in his favor but this video is old. Splashing into star after star like a Mansion pool party you'll be sucked in wanting more. A mild Faces Of Death have you. I haven't seen ""When The Applause Died"" but buy it for Death In Hollywood.",1199577600,9,822,4.309677419354839

426821,2,6302130948,"Not really impressed here. Not often that I watch documentaries, though I am a movie addict for sure so this one interested me. I found this documentary to be more about the actors and the films they made, and less about their actual deaths. In other words I expected some sort of insight into the death of these actors, not just a voice telling us that they died from an overdose of sleeping pills. Not horrible, just not very compelling nor entertaining in my opinion.",1433980800,3,470,4.541176470588235

426883,3,6302130948,A little disappointed. It just covered the bare essentials and never delved into the reasons or people under suspicion regarding the deaths of these celebrities.

426887,3,6302130948,"Death in Hollywood is a decent documentary with information on the tragic or untimely deaths of many Hollywood stars, but it does not engage in any speculation about the most mysterious of deaths (George Reeves or Natalie Wood, for example) and gets certain facts wrong.  It repeats the myth that Jayne Mansfield was decapitated, for example, which is simply not true.  It also dismisses Marilyn Monroe's death as the result of an overdose of sleeping pills, ignoring the fact that no pills were found in her stomach.  It states that Jean Harlow's Christian Scientist mother refused medical treatment for her daughter, which is untrue.  I can't help but wonder what facts it might have gotten wrong about the deaths I knew nothing about.  The documentary is also quite lacking in details - it mentions nothing about Donald Turnupseed's role in James Dean's tragic death, for example.  While it does contain somewhat graphic photos, such as Paul Bern's body, and actual video of Vic Morrow's terrible death on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie, it tends to overlook or minimize the truly gruesome murders of others, such as Bob Crane.

If you want details - such as the sequence of events that happened on the boat before Natalie Wood died or the details leading up to the death of Bruce Lee - you aren't going to find them in Death in Hollywood.  You certainly aren't going to hear any speculation here at all about possible murders being covered up as suicides.  It's still a good documentary featuring information on the deaths of many Hollywood stars, but I would advise the viewer not to accept the information given here as the final word on any star's death.",1365206400,8,1666,4.7972027972027975
