1366878,5,B00004WZ53,"I love this video.  It consists of normal step moves infused with ""power"" segments where you work harder.  I have been doing this video for years and I am still tired at the end.  If you are a moderate to advanced step-er you will be challenged and will stay challenged.",1022025600,,270,4.36
1366879,3,B00004WZ53,"I hate to be one of the reviewers who doesn't like this video much, but the truth is, I think it could have been much better.  I didn't like the set, it was to dark and dreary for me and I can't say that Gin Miller is one of my favorite instructors.  Although the workout was good and I was definitely sweating a lot (I'm an advanced exerciser, I mostly do step workouts, and dance), I was bored with the repetitiveness less than halfway into the workout, and I felt like I was flailing around  too much.  I don't think the stretching at the end was enough for such an intense workout, and I think the heart-rate checks in between segments were kind of distracting.  I doubt that I will do this video very much, but I'm glad that it has been such an inspirational and helpful workout for so many other people!",1019174400,,809,4.261437908496732
1366880,5,B00004WZ53,"I loathe cardio work...just hate it. But someone told me interval training is very effective, and this is one of the best tapes there is for it. Wow were they right.
The tape consists of a good warm-up and stretch; then 10 intervals (2 minutes of basic/recovery followed by 1 minute of killer intensity training); then a thorough cool-down and stretch.  And she provides a VERY motivating short speech at the end.
Things I Love:  Gin's cueing is absolutely flawless.  The music is motivating but not ""in your face"" or irritating.  The intervals can be unbelievably tough or just a bit of a challenge, or anywhere in between.  ""It's your choice"" as Gin says.  Gin offers 2-3 ways to make the intervals more or less challenging, so virtually anyone can do this tape.  Gin is extremely supportive and encouraging.  She knows how to get you to give more than you think you've got.  I end up ""HA-ing"" along on some of the intervals--definitely not typical behavior for me.  But she just makes it fun!  In fact, I love this tape so much I've recommended it to others on my fitness forum and promised to buy it from them if they don't like it.  THAT's a solid recommendation!
In short, this is one kick-butt workout in 50 minutes.  It's easy to catch onto the steps so you get a great workout the first time through. And it offers enough modications/intensifiers that you'll probaby never outgrow it.
Things I Don't Love:  NOTHING!",1002672000,,1424,4.644
1366881,5,B00004WZ53,"Reebok Intense Moves is an ideal step aerobic tape that succeeds through its motivating trainer, Gin Miller, and a flexible structure to meet your level of stamina. If you are turned off by pastel-clad, dura-smiling 90-lb. instructors with incurable cheeriness, you'll like Miller. She motivates through her strength and clear, informative instruction. The music is serious, power-driven, and thus fits the mood perfectly. If you are looking for a workout that will burn fat and increase physical fitness, this video is worth the wait!",1001980800,,535,5.380952380952381
1366882,5,B00004WZ53,"This step workout is truly scalable and you won't get bored with the workout. (Well, actually, my wife is looking for a different workout because we've been using this one for about 2 years and she needs something for a change up. I'm still happy though.) I really like the interval training. There are 3 different moves for each intensity training interval so the video grows with your level of fitness (or energy level for the day). Gin's voice, the music, and the moves do not wear on you, which is critical if you plan to workout with tapes. I just won't do Kathy Smith. I find her irritating after a couple of workouts. There is something a bit more hip and palatable about Gin. I also tried Reebok Rhythm and Moves but it's a little too dancy for me and not as scalable.",999648000,,776,4.395833333333333
1366883,5,B00004WZ53,"I like this video because it has great music and beats (lots of bass). the moves are not hard to follow and the video never gets boring (like most videos i own) because the music is so good and the moves ARE ""intense.""  this is a video that will make you feel at least 10 pounds lighter after one session. also, i live in a apartment and the space i have to workout is limited.  the video keeps you close to your step, but has many moves to keep you going and stretches every part of the body from head to toe.  i love this video!!",972172800,,531,3.990566037735849
1366884,5,B00004WZ53,"This tape is not for the weak hearted.  If you follow it to a ""t"", you will get, without a doubt, one of the most challenging step workouts anywhere.  It beats most of the hard core step workouts at  the gym.",945820800,,208,4.024390243902439
1366885,4,B00004WZ53,This is one step workout that had me working for the entire duration of the video.  I used this tape when jogging was not possible due to time constraints and felt as though I jogged for 30 minutes after the workout.  An excellent advanced step workout.  You must try it.,935971200,,271,4.38
1366886,5,B00004WZ53,"This video really makes you whole body to move from the beginning to the end.  Is very challenging, specially for beginners.  So practice is highly recommended before purchasing this video.",921283200,,189,5.266666666666667

7925858,5,B00004WZ53,"I bought this video years ago, and still work out to it at least once or twice a week.
The instructor gives excellent cues, the pace is perfect and the workout is long enough to feel like a thorough workout. If I'm short on time, I fast forward and skip a few segments to shorten it, which is easy to do because it is interval training. All of the segments flow seamlessly with no abrupt transitions. It is easy to go at exactly the pace you want to go - there are many choices, clearly demonstrated. I often change my pace depending on how energetic I feel and change the height of my step.
I can't think of any flaws with this workout except that she doesn't say in the beginning which of the exercisers are demonstrating which intensity level (ie. low, intermediate or advanced), but this becomes obvious if you watch.
I like the instructor's personality, which isn't cheesy or over-enthusiastic like many others - she's sensible and focused.
Once again, I really love how the whole video from start to finish flows - the warmup, the intervals, the active recovery after each interval, and the cool down flows so that your heart rate and breating gradually speeds up and gradually slows down accordingly.
At one point, however, you're doing jumping jacks which is by no means restful and she says ""are we rested yet??"" which doesn't make any sense!
I hope my tape doesn't wear out - I'll want to keep using it for many years to come!!!",1082332800,,1438,4.5346153846153845

I have to say I bought this tape as an addition to my Tae-bo collection..To do Tae-bo as the warm -up and then the Intense moves ---All I can say is wow!!---The music compliments the intensity of the workout/not distracting --The filming is subdued-not to loud--the people in the video look like athletes -not smiling dolls ---and they don't try and hide their pain---the intensity Gin Miller has created is amazing -You can tailor it to  meet your needs-you will never be bored with this workout--A MUST HAVE!!!

7925860,5,B00004WZ53,"I don't write many reviews, but I had to write about this video. This is such a great workout--well-deserving of ""Staff Favorite"" status. It begins with a warm-up, then goes into 10-3 min. intervals of 1 minute of intense and 2 mins. of ""active"" rest, then ending with a cool-down and stretch. You can choose from 3 intensity levels, hard, harder and hardest. I did this workout yesterday for the first time, using a 6-inch step and doing the ""hard"" level moves (the easiest of the three). I exercise at a low-advanced level, and I got such a great workout; I was sweating all over the place. This step workout is not dancy, more athletic (which I like), and never boring. In fact, when it was over, I couldn't believe that 50 minutes had gone by; it was so much fun. Gin Miller is informative, encouraging, and she has to be the best cuer ever. I had been looking for a good cardio workout to offset my strength training, and I have found it. It will take a while for me to outgrow this one. My regrets are that I didn't buy this video sooner, and that it's not available on dvd. But, if you're looking for a challenging step workout with simple choreography, great instruction and cueing, good set and music, and even good workout length, buy this one!",1071014400,,1254,4.456521739130435
7925861,5,B00004WZ53,"I have over 20 step videos, 6 of which are from the Reebok series.  Intense Moves is, without a doubt, the most challenging video I own.  Don't even think about trying this video yet if you are just starting out because this workout requires tons of stamina.  This workout takes you through 10 intervals that push you to the limit of your current endurance level.  Gin Miller (one of the best aerobics instructors in the business) starts each interval by showing you a base move and then demonstrates two or three other ways to complete the move that requires more energy.  Here are a few examples:  in the first interval, you can do a basic over-the top with a jump or you could add a leap before going over-the-top, or, at maximum effort, you can add a lunge back.  In interval 4, you can do a ski jump up on top of the bench or you can do a ski jump behind the bench to each side or (at maximum effort) you can ski jump over the bench.  Once you have chosen which level you want to work at, you explode into it for one minute.  A timer breaks it down into 15-second chunks so you don't have to work at your maximum effort the entire time.  After the minute is up, Gin brings you down with a 2-minute ""rest"" period.  You will not be kicking back during these ""rest"" periods.  While you ""rest"", you will be doing basic aerobics that will build up to the next interval.  I've found that the base moves to these intervals (the minimum effort)  require power moves (i.e. airborne moves) that are often used as an advanced alternative on other step videos.
This workout is challenging, but it is also fun.  You do not repeat the same intervals, so the workout is always fresh and moves very quickly.  Plus, Gin Miller is cool and, unlike with some other workout videos, you feel cool using her workouts.  Even though this video wears me out, I find myself wanting to pop it in my VCR.  I can do higher levels for longer periods of time each time I use it. The entire workout (including warm-up and cool down) is about 50 minutes. I definitely recommend Intense Moves for any intermediate and advanced stepper who wants to improve his/her endurance.",1046131200,,2145,4.414758269720102

7925863,5,B00004WZ53,"For those who are looking for a very efficient, intense workout without the fluff, this tape can't be beat.  Gin Miller is clear and concise, and is actually about the only instructor who I can say doesn't get on my nerves even after many times through the routine.
Very highly recommended!",1036800000,,290,4.686274509803922

On a serious note, this could be the workout for all levels. I love interval training, and I am an intermediate, Gin Miller shows three different levels in this video, so you can modify to suit yourself and as you progress you can make the moves harder.
It also has the kind of music that makes you want to do the tape over and over.
You want this! Get this now!.",1035504000,,394,4.197368421052632

Gin Miller is truly inspirational, she is tireless, her voice is well modulated not too high that it is annoying like Kathy Smiths, girls are truly down to earth , natural and not too showy like other girls in other tapes.  I used it about 3 times a week because I alternate  with the advance Tae Bo. Great job for those who really want to feel a burn, it feels good especially when waking up in the morning you feel that your legs really worked out.",1026691200,,478,4.230769230769231
