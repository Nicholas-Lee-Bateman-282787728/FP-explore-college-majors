7964255,5,6304152825,"Great movie. I'm annoyed by reviews calling it a ""blatant E.T. rip-off"", sure there are a couple parallels but this movie is really quite unique. The cast is charming, all the characters are truly characters, and the musical score by Joseph Williams (son of Star-Wars composer John Williams) really draws you in. The actors performances, especially Paul Winfield's, really bring it all together and make it real, it is evident that everyone gave this movie they're best shot. This was my favorite movie as a kid, and I still love it!

In short, this is a very charming movie with a lot of heart!",1355356800,,595,4.721153846153846
