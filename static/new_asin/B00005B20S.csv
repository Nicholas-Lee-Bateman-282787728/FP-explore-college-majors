1420409,5,B00005B20S,"Forever and Ever is how long I'd like the show to go, but obviously that's not going to happen. Having already seen the entire series on VHS, and some of it on DVD, I can say these last few episodes wrap things up pretty well. The only actual complaint I have is that they didn't do anything else in this universe. No sequels, no prequels, no spin-offs... I find it depressing, because you get the know the characters so well and the world is rich and deep... I know they made a movie, but that's just a condensed version of this series, and doesn't really count towards more material. Still... I highly recommend this one. Of course, if you're looking at ordering info for volume 8, odds are you've already seen alteast part of the series, so I don't think I need to bother praising this series any more.",988588800,3,805,4.409395973154362
1420460,5,B00005B20S,"I would say that Escaflowne is the best anime ever created. It has great music, great animation, great characters, a great story, great action...overall, it's just plain great.
I'm a huge escaflowne fan, and I liked every single episode of the Escaflowne series.
The last volume of the Escaflowne series is the best one, in my opinion. Although, the ending left me with a sense of vague unfulfillment, it was a good ending nevertheless.
On behalf of Escaflowne fans everywhere, I hope that someday Escaflowne will continue and allow people something to look forward to.",1018396800,3,569,5.0
1420461,5,B00005B20S,"In Vol. 7 the show implied that Zaibach had a lot more then the fate alteration engine to hide from Gaea and vol. 8 did an excelent job of showing those secrets,i mean REALLY big revealations  that set everything to the right perspective for every character. In the final battle they explained the most underdeveloped character of the series Jajuka who played a major role in shaping and redeming Dilandau and Gave Allen a resolution he so much needed , Van learned the lessons of war and peace , everybody got really happy in the end even the supporting cast on earth,which could have been ""cheesy"" in an another show but the script makes it add up here.
  On the technology aspect the Melefs remained cool untill the end,the weird weapons were dangerously familiar to ""our"" hazardous Mystic moon counterparts and the entire alchemy angle was very interesting (see Jajuka's flashbacks for that fact).
The fast pace actually helped the show end with flawless closure of old plots and seeds of a possible future sequel show,i don't know if anyone else would like that but i know i'd love another Escaflowne.",1017187200,2,1106,4.780104712041885
1420462,5,B00005B20S,"I must admit that the final episode was bit disappointing.  However, still considering other manga series, i would say this was a decent ending.  I am giving five stars, because you just have to give five for Escaflowne.  It's flawless.  It embodies the very best qualities of manga.  The storyline is superb.  The entire concept behind the storyline has few flaws, but the concept itself is really grand and mind-opening experience.
Final episode deserves five, because it is the grand finale of the whole series, The Vision of Escaflowne.  This will expanding your imagination and open your mind.  Must see this and get a copy.",1016409600,,629,4.923809523809524
1420463,5,B00005B20S,"As in all the Escaflowne DVDs this one has beautiful imagery and music that is not only wonderful but increases the emotion of the picture by a thousand times. This is the last of the DVDs and give a truely good ending, nothing like the Disney endings that are all sappy and too good to be true, although it is not one of despair. This show, although animated, is one of true realism in the emotions of the characters and the way the story moves. In this DVD it tells of Hitome's frustration at the people's irrational thoughts and how she leaves Gaea. It also shows why Folken has black wings and what that means to his future. Hitomi does come back to Gaea because she truely loves someone there and only their love can stop all the violence because the Zone of Abslote Fortune has been actived, it allows everyone's thoughts and desires to come true. It shows that love is a very powerful thing, but that is very delicate and can be broken. I love this show and it is a fitting end for a anime like this, they all did an excellent job on concluding it. I give it more than five stars because it is so much superior to all other shows and movies that I have seen",1016409600,3,1164,4.247747747747748
1420464,3,B00005B20S,The story of Escaflowne brings tears to your eyes and laughter in your heart...,1014076800,,79,4.714285714285714
1420465,5,B00005B20S,"I absolutely love Escaflowne.  In my opinion it is by far one of the most intiguing anime ever created.  Escaflowne has everything an audience could possibly want.  It's full of romance, action, suspense, light-hearted comedy, and even a little bit of angst.  After I bought the first video, I was hooked.  The story just keeps getting better.  This particular video is my favorite.  It shows how our favorite herione, Hitomi, finally overcomes her unsure heart.  It gives people of all ages a necessary lesson on the true power of love.  Also, it answers many of the questions you've been asking yourself throughout the series, including the secret past of a certain character...
All in all, this video is definately worth every penny.  It's a must have for all anime lovers.  The ending, however, did leave me unsatisfied and wanting more.  There really needs to be another season to tie up the few loose ends that were left... including a big one that I'm still disappointed about... you'll just have to watch to know what I'm talking about.",1007424000,,1044,4.836158192090395
1420466,5,B00005B20S,"Warning: possible spoilers

Let me start off by saying that I have seen a lot of anime, and that anime of Escaflowne's caliber is a rare find, indeed. It holds the highest rank on my favorites list, along with the widely acclaimed Rurouni Kenshin.

The reason I was compelled to write a review was because I disagree with Charles Solomon when he says "" a more powerful resolution is needed than a chat about the nature of human desire with Hitomi."" ""A more powerful resolution"" would have contrasted directly with one of Hitomi's main (and basically accomplished) goals in the entire series: stopping a war and the feelings that provoked it. ""A more powerful resolution"" would have showed that the elimination of the destructive feelings which had caused the war still ran rampant. But it didn't have such an ending as, for example, Van destroying Dornkirk completely, for Van had learned form Hitomi that revenge (and especially killing) is not a good thing, and should not be done unless absolutely neccesary. Dornkirk had already been proven wrong,after all.

On a final note, the ending was also very appropriate, for if one thinks about it, the series could not have reasonably ended any other way. All in all, Escaflowne is one of the most creative, intricate, and satisfying anime one will ever see.
Plus, Dilandau is one of THE most awesome characters in the history of anime, but that's just my opinion.",1006214400,5,1412,4.850622406639004
1420467,5,B00005B20S,"The new trend in anime serie are very mature. I think about Cowboy bebop and Escaflowne. The animation was first rate and the deep in charactere study are great. And this two serie have a very sad ending. Like the real life, love are not so strong. Faye fall in love with Spike but she can,t stop him. Hitomi and van are separated. It was like real life.
But in fact, this kind of end take is roots in tradionnal japanese thatre. In fact, two kind of heros exist in kabuki and cinema: the tetayaku et the nimaime. One is the true Samurai who
believe in duty. He never, never sleep with girl or fall for one. I he do, he neever end with her, because his duty are stronger. On the other hands, they create the nimaime for the commoner who was a great public for theatre. This kind of hero are weak and fall for girls. But he always had probleme. The true samourai die frequently at the ned, because it was the only time when he can be honest with his feeling.
If you think about that, it's not difficult to see who was who! Zatoichi or Mifune's hero never sleep with girl.  They are strong hero.
At the end of Escaflowne, Yukari and Amano are a couple but Hitomi are alone. But Van can,t be with a girl. He was pure. Allen sleep with girl but rememerb girls in the show considere it was bad (i love a real playboy she said). When Millerne learn Chid ws the child of allen, she was shocked.
In traditional Japanese's story, the weakes hero sleep with women, he fall in love. But when he do that, all collapse. Spkie sleep with Julia in his past but this bring unhappy things. He was a mixte of Nimaime and tetayaku. At the end, he was a true samurai who die for his honor.
Van on the other hand was a true samurai. Like occidental knight, his love was pure. So, a pure love can't stand sex. In the Japanese mind.
The romantic story in Edo era when a man and a woman fall in love always finish by a suicide. It was the most romatic end for a Japanese. They can't live a flesh love, it was not pure. So they died.
This why Hitomi and Van give up their love. Althoug the creator may say it's what not the case, it was a classical end. They are Japanese and even if they don't study Japanese traditional theatre, they know it in their deep mind. It was what they saw in cinema.
I propose this game, each time you watch a japanese movie or anime, try to determine who was who. Remember hero like Zatoichi, nemury Kyoshiro, Yojimbo, Actarus, Captain Harlock ect ect.. you will knwo the end of the next anime you will see.
I have more than 500 films at home, and i can see in most of the japanese film. But exception exist. But not much....",1005264000,5,2630,4.177165354330708
1420468,5,B00005B20S,"After buying the first DVD, because of its high praises, I quickly became infatuated with the series and had to see it all the way through. The plot line was very intriguing, though, they were a lot of questions that need to be answered. Hopefully the movie will cover most of the questions. The characters were incredible, centralizing around Van, Hitomi, and Allen. All were highly memorable and developed thoroughly throughout the series, especially Van and Hitomi. The idea of Isaac Newton being a bad guy is just magnificent, that at least gives the series 4 stars.
The presentation was also good and the Escaflowne singing, chanting was kinda soothing. The visuals were not totally state-of-the-art, but were good and the fight scenes were smooth and quick. It was a colorful anime with some humor, some love, and some sadness. Beautifully done and recommended for all anime fans, especially those who like Record of Lodoss War and Gundam.",1003708800,,945,4.987341772151899

I can't believe Hitomi does that, grrr, I won't say what but this is a MUSt buy,  however I feel i should warn sensitive ears it does say damn a lot and bast........ once. I hated that part, that was the only bad thing to me. I can't believe she doesn't kiss him, ahhhh! The motion pictures are great, showing great detail and improving with every scene! The continual twists and plots. very complex for an anime. GREAt GREAt gREat!!! I will always be a escaflowne fan! VAN forever! LoL!

1420490,5,B00005B20S,"The last video of Vision of Escaflowne really captures you in the emotions of the characters, and makes you feel almost exactly what they are experiencing. The music is at its best in these episodes, and some scenes you can't help but be blown away by. Each character in in the last DVD has a personal role and everything falls into place rather well, considering the fact that there was only about 25min to do it in. This entire series seems to be created for young adults and up. I say this because of the intricate plot, and constant fighting. (Which is not that violent to say at least.) If I could rate this more than 5 stars, consider it done!!",998697600,3,650,4.380165289256198
1420491,5,B00005B20S,"Alright, this is what we were all waiting for.. I love this series. Full of action and romance and hidden things that when uncovered make you go, ""What?!""
Well, now, this is the end for our lovely cast of Zaibach fighting heroes. Although Dilandau is one of my personal heroes, anyways, this is the one where we find out that Hitomi's true feelings weren't for Allen after all, and Van's feeling's for Hitomi are exposed!
Ok...after watching the part where Dryden dumps Millerna, you might be horrified for a bit, but don't worry girls, Allen is too occupied with his long lost sister to move in on her!  Allen gives up Hitomi realizing that he was not harboring romantic feelings for Hitomi, but ""i love you like a sister"" kind of feelings.
I was sad when Hitomi left Gaia for the Mystic Moon... But her and Van love each other and they say that they can see each other whenever they want. I don't know if that means they will teleport, or if they will just see each other in visions and dreams... Sigh.... The relationship between them doesn't get explored too much, but it's real love...
I don't want to give away the important parts, but you must have this! Once you start, you will be immersed in the world of Escaflowne!
Oh yeah, I have to comment on the excellent looking movie trailer for next year's release of the theatrical movie. Oh I can't wait! When you get this, I know you want it... You will be like, ""Oh man! I can't wait til that comes out on DVD!"" then you will buy it like me.. :)  And the extras also feature something else, footage from the playstation game?! What playstation game!? I need it. So do you.
I'm not done yet, there is also, included in the extras, a concert by the voice of Hitomi! You know, she sings the songs? That's cool.. I like that.
I have to go sit down now...",997833600,2,1806,4.372023809523809
1420492,5,B00005B20S,"Escaflowne has the potential.  It contains the greatest elements of fantasy, scifi, and romance.  I recommand this series to anyone who enjoys good anime!",997228800,,154,5.375
1420493,5,B00005B20S,"WHOA!!
I know i'm REALLY late on finishing this series, but i really wanted to wait until i had all 8 DVDs before diving in.
I can't really say anything that hasn't been said already.  This series was so incredibly fantastic.  It really is a masterpiece.
My favorite aspect of this series, besides the terrific artwork, and wonderful music was to be so unoriginal - the character studies.  Cowboy bebop was the first anime series i had seen that did an excellent job of really studying a character, giving the Viewer insight into a characters past and how it affects his or her future.
It's Sooo hard for me to say this, but The Vision of Escaflowne may & probably has done it better.  Not only did the immediate cast of protagonists get lots of spotlight for character development, but MOST if not all of the villians encountered were given a ""Reading"" by Hitomi.  Excellent comment by the way... using her psyic abilities to illustrate a characers history.  Falken, Naria and Aria.. even the Shape shifting doppelganger had serious art and camera time (which some could consider unnecessary) dedicated to their own personal Study.
WOW!!!!",995932800,,1140,4.82051282051282

With a great (yet a little complicated) plot, excellent music scores, and beautiful animation, nothing compares to ""Escaflowne"". This video in particular is my favorite.

1420496,4,B00005B20S,"First of all, the editorial review apparently doesn't understand that Japanese animation does not share the American animation obsession with neat, clean endings with everything tied up nicely. It would be more appropriate to compare this to live-action material intended for the same age range, where neat endings are not quite so common. This is not Saturday-morning animation, no matter what FOX thinks; it is a satisfyingly complex plot intended for an older audience, although there is little here I would object to letting a younger child watch. Incidentally, the FOX version of this masterpiece is badly hacked up; I watched the first two episodes of it and flatly refused to watch more (I had already watched the entire series in subtitled format). Very disappointing, as that was an ideal opportunity to introduce this to a wider audience.
That said, the ending of this series came as a bit of a surprise. While I still enjoyed it, and consider it an excellent wrap-up to an excellent series, I felt it was a little disjointed--a different style from the rest of the series. Like other reviewers, I feel that the series could easily have been extended by several more episodes, or even an entire season--so much was left uncovered. On top of that, it can also be said that most of the characters were so well developed that it was almost painful to have to watch the closing, knowing that there wasn't more; this is one of those stories that will never end--Escaflowne was not a complete tale; it was merely a glimpse into a wider world, albeit a fascinating one.
However, all good stories are like that, with the feeling that there is something more happening just out of sight. If it works for live-action, why not for animation?",992736000,5,1740,4.822742474916388

1420498,5,B00005B20S,We watched every single episode of escaflowne and in our opinion this one is the best but we think that it would be better if we had seen it in dubbed not subtitled. We still think very highly of it. Although it was a great film the only problem we had with it was the ending...it should have had more closure unless they plan to come out with a new series and explain the whole ending. It would be NICE! What would be even nicer is (spoiler) if Van and Hitomi got together or kissed at least! Throughout the kast couple of episodes it would have been nice if Allen layed off Hitomi because she belongs with Van because Allen is just trying to use Hitomi to replace Marlene. We think nothing less of this series because it was very amusing when Dilandau Abatou turned out to be Celena Shezar. Just PLEASE make a new series or come out with Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea on dvd or vhs (dvd better). We think all the escaflowne fans should write angry letters to get them to start a new series to explain the whole Hitomi and Van thing and they better get together...or else (haha).,990921600,2,1077,4.284313725490196

7936438,4,B00005B20S,"Escaflowne was a great series. It had pretty good animation(for 1996), a great story, memorable characters, plenty of action, and drama. I was totally engrossed until the last 5 episodes or so. Up until that point, the story had a very epic feeling going for it. As it reached the end, it seemed to lose it's fire. There was no epic final battle, no tear jerking farewell, or no heartwarming reuniting of lost lovers. It just kind of ended. Although I liked this series, I was very disappointed with the conclusion. I think  that this story deserved better treatment, and so do the fans. Overall, it's still really good and worth watching.",1358812800,,639,4.705357142857143
7936439,2,B00005B20S,"I loved the whole series, but I really have to take issue with the last couple of episodes. Who the heck were the Nuclear bomb people? Now I know that Japan has war issues, but where did those people come from? They weren't mentioned at all in the series until the last 6 episodes, but suddenly they appear, have uber weaponry and then try to take over. And I hate that.. it's a plot device for someone to say ""War is Bad!!""... like we don't know that. There was no other reason for that to happen, save for the 'message' that the creators were trying to convey.

If these guys were mentioned earlier in the series, then fine I would agree with the inclusion at the end, but it seemed to me they were created just to bang us over the head with the 'message'.

A typically bad japanese ending to a great show (would it kill them to have some semblence of a happy ending, I guess I should be grateful that the main cast survived)",1168646400,2,927,4.231638418079096
7936440,5,B00005B20S,"These are the last stanzas in what is one of the monuments of Japanese anime, a rich fantasy story as memorable as any other notable series.  Hitomi, after fleeing Gaea back to earth finds that her experiences have left her with many unresolved feelings.  When Van flies Escaflowne across the gap between the worlds to retrieve her she joins him, even though it is to return to the middle of an horrific war.  Hitomi realizes that she can run no longer - that if Gaea is to heal, she must do her part.
By this DVD it is clear to the viewer that fate, and its changing, is the underlying theme of this series.  Isaac Newton attempts to manipulate it so that the Zaibach Empire will rule the world, nearly repeating the mistake of the Atlantean forebearers of the Gaeans.  Tarot cards reveal futures that seem inevitable.  And the intertwining of the characters defies the rules of coincidence.
Into this apparent march to cataclysmic disaster and tragedy enters Hitomi, the most atypical of anime heroines.  Thin and athletic rather than lush, cute rather than pretty, it is her inner nature rather than any physical ability that gives her the power to challenge the inevitable.  Hitomi's special skill is the power to believe.  And in doing so, she reveals that fate is far from ineluctable, that simply humans can change outcomes with their minds and hearts.
Hitomi's confusion about her feelings towards Van and Alan Schezar, her hatred of the continuous stream of violence that mars life on Gaea, and the struggle she has to accept what she can do make her a warm and accessible character to the viewer.  This is true of all the protagonists of Escaflowne, making what would otherwise be a pompous fantasy concoction into a compelling, life affirming drama.
As endings go, this one starts a bit too slowly and ends too soon.  I would have liked to see a stronger focus on the dynamics between Hitomi and Van as they realize their love for each other and must confront the roadblocks in their way.  There is room for an entire additional episode, although the movie version of Escaflowne fills in much of this touching connection between two people separated by worlds.  Even so, this is a fitting end to what has been a delightful series - one which I will always recommend without question.",1057881600,6,2294,4.719298245614035
7936441,2,B00005B20S,"My wife and I started getting the Escaflowne DVD's on a whim after having seen the show on Fox Kids.  We were blown away by how utterly fantastic and engaging the original version was - so much so that we anxiously awaited each installment (couldn't afford to get them all at once).
The animation and story of this series is easily the best I've ever seen -as engaging as the original Robotech and far surpassing it in intelligence and beauty.  The characters are likable, the music is stirring, and the story highly compelling -
UNTIL-
What the heck happened in this last disc? Its like another writer took over.  What was a wonderful story gets abruptly ended with some kitty girl pseudo incest/lesbianism (which was kind've a downer considering we were watching the show with our kid and there'd been nothing like this in the entire series up until this point), and a tacked on nonsensical psychobabble ending (think: Akira).
We were VERY disappointed by the conclusion to this series, because the rest of it is HIGHLY recommended.  Of course if you've been following the series this long, you've got to get this one too, but man what a let down.  And don't bother with the movie either...ugh.",1048032000,2,1196,4.730769230769231
