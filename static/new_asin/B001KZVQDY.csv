8316667,5,B001KZVQDY,"The title of this video is misleading - it's not about ""racetrack tech"" in general, it's about technological developments in motorsports safety for race cars.  The video isn't comprehensive, in that many topics aren't covered (roll cages, fire suppression systems, side impact protection, etc.), but it still covers a lot of ground and does it quite well.  This is a must-watch for anyone interested in motorsports safety, especially those who drive on race tracks.",1406332800,,465,5.27027027027027
