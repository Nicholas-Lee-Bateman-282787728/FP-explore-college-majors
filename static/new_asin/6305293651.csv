The DVD isn't damaged and the damage to DVD box isn't much a concern, it's just that, why is there a hole and what is that material at the slit?!
I'll update my review when I actually watch the DVD, and I'm sure I'll like it, but I just wanted to point out this occurrence.",1520035200,,387,4.105263157894737
7887988,1,6305293651,"This is not a good anime. At all. I think I just paid someone $1 to seve me a year old sandwhich. Buuuut, it is the kind of bad that is mildly entertaining",1451692800,,155,3.727272727272727
7887989,4,6305293651,This was interesting.  worth seeing for fans of goring 90's anime! lol,1428796800,,70,4.833333333333333
7887990,4,6305293651,I ordered this mainly to practice Japanese listening comprehension (tired of watching Jhorror) but ended up liking it a lot. Some animation is static but there are many stunning psychedelic scenes with vivid colors. The plot is just average but I'm keeping this in permanent collection because it's just so different in style and subject matter than other anime.,1374278400,,362,5.1525423728813555
7887991,4,6305293651,"i was kinda skeptical about buying this anime, but since it was so cheap i decided to go with it. the animation is pretty old school, but the story is actually kinda interesting. it turned out to be actually kinda gory(which i love) so i ended up enjoying this anime :) i would recommend it if you're into old school animes, but if you're into the newer stuff you might be kinda picky with this one.",1353628800,,399,4.2631578947368425
