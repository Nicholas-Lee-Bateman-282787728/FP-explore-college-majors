8176940,5,B000NDECJY,"A very special DVD release by the Animal Planet. The DVD
covers the world of poultry shows at several locations.
We learn of the dedication and care lavished on pure bred
chickens by their owners, including visits to poultry
farms in several States. The color photography is superb.
Anyone not familiar with pure bred chickens will be amazed by the varied plumage colors and patterns exhibited on these fowls, some of which are household pets. Well known TV and movie comedian Fred Willard hosts the program and gives us his share of humorous remarks.
Anyone who thinks chickens are just for eating will come away with an appreciation of these fine birds and by the
sometimes quirky people who raise them.",1321228800,2,705,4.8347107438016526
