2517048,5,B000EDWLQ4,"I would have to say this is one the novelas that has you hooked from begining to end. There so mush that was not on the DVD that had to be there to really enjoy and get the whole story. But I loved every minute of it. I was disappointed that I didn't hear Luis Miguel singing his song, I always say you have to have the original song to go with it. I would recommend this one. But I think they needed to add more of the scenes to really enjoy the story.",1183507200,,453,3.8297872340425534
2517049,3,B000EDWLQ4,"this novela is OK. the only worthwhile performances are Alejandra Avalos and Eric Castillo and Fabian Robles.  Juan Soler and Paty Manterola  are not convincing, but sure tell each like 100 times they love each other , then Paty says I hate you, I'll never believe her acting.  Also, there's too much violence, too many characters get killed off. If you can handle that. Fabian Robles is awesome ! He is so wicked fun to watch! Alejandra Avalos is really good, her best role I ever seen her in.  Monika Sanchez is good also as Mariposa.  So I would recommend it for these actors and actresses, but you might fast forward some scenes.",1168992000,,633,4.566371681415929
2517050,1,B000EDWLQ4,"The mexican soap opera was one of the best that I have ever seen. While it was being aired I caught about 90% of it. I was so disapointed after I complety watch the dvd in full. It as nearly a third of it cut out. Most of the non critical scenes were deleted. Everything about Julia's sister Soledad was basically deleted. The part where she tries to play it off like she's pregnant by Gabriel was deleted. Everything about here having to choose between Samuel, and Leandro was deleted. Ever thing about Alvaro mis treating Lucero was deleted and just about everything about Lucero and Ramon was cut out. Everything about Julia and Sebastian's almost relationship was deleted. The whole funeral scene where Julia's first son dies is gone. Most of Nadia and Alvaro relationship hardly happend. This was just a huge disapointment for me. Please let me know if there is anywhere where I can get a full length version of it.",1154908800,15,920,4.615853658536586
2517051,5,B000EDWLQ4,This is a fabulous telenovela!  I have even given this one to friends as a gift.  I enjoyed this one from beginning to end.  Some of the episodes are condensed but it really doesn't hurt the continuity of the video.  This video was filmed in the Yucatan area and the scenery is breathtaking.  I would highly recommend this video. This is a beautiful as well as entertaining video.  The actors are attractive also. This is one of best!,1154390400,4,434,4.5
2517052,5,B000EDWLQ4,"Une magnifique novela pleine de rebondissements. La production est gigantesque et les acteurs sont au sommet de leur forme. Une Pati Manterola au charme et au caractere de feu et un Juan Soler implacable ! Bref, un pur chef-d'oeuvre a decouvrir.",1149206400,,245,5.0
2517053,5,B000EDWLQ4,"When most people think about novelas or soap operas many people roll their eyes and believe it is the same melodramatic situations that repeat in each story over and over again. Well... they're right! Novelas are melodramatic, they are unbelievable and if you are a hopeless romantic like myself then you will always want to watch a novela at least once in a while because it is highly entertaining now back to the novela Apuesta Por Un Amor. I happened to watch this novela while it was being shown on Unvision last year and it had me hooked the moment I heard Luis Miguels song ""Que Seas Feliz"", as the novelas intro. This is the story about a young proud and strong willed woman by the name of Julia Montano known in town as ""la Potra"" (which in spanish means black stallion), daughter of a rich ranch holder in the state of Yucatan she challenges the mexican macho philosophy that both her brother and father have that a womans place should be in the house. Training horses, and managing her fathers estate she proves to her father than she is more than just the housekeeper thereby earning the respect of her father. However life takes an unexpected turn when she catches her fiance cheating on her with her best friend, her brother mistreating the womenfolk in town, and most importantly the arrival of an evil stepmother who only wants the wealth of her fathers estate. With her life in chaos Julia is distrustful and cautious with men until a lone stranger comes in town by the name of Gabriel. A drifter and gambler Gabriel falls heads over heels over Julia. (of course he firsts sees her when she is skinny dipping in the river) and promises ""la Potra"" that by the end of the year whether she likes it or not she will be with him by his side, as his wife, and most importantly in his bed. And thus begins the romance, the suspense, and the drama that is unfolded in Apuesta Por Un Amor (which in english means Betting on Love) where love, loyalty, and courage trample over evil, envy, and infidelity.",1148169600,10,2010,4.524725274725275
2517054,5,B000EDWLQ4,"Esta es la mejor telenovela que he visto en mucho tiempo las actuaciones de Paty y Juan son extraordinarias insuperables, nada que ver que la primera version colombiana de la Potra Zaina, Gracias por darnos la oportunidad de tenerla en casa.",1140220800,4,241,4.902439024390244
2517105,4,B000EDWLQ4,"Exelente Telenovela!!! En cuanto a la Edicion esta Muy Bien Hecha. No se notan defasajes, cortes bruscos ni mucho menos se pierde el hilo de la Historia.
Lo que si note es que no tiene el tema oficial de la Novela, la cancion de Luis Miguel, Que Seas Feliz. Tiene un Instrumental, que no esta tan mal, la verdad se me hizo muy divertido y no me disgusta, al igual que me di cuenta que no contiene la musica incidental original, pero tiene otra que es muy agradable, ni se nota, ya que quitaron la original para poner la nueva, no como en otras ediciones que ponen una encima de la otra.
Un Error que encontre en la Contratapa es el hecho de no tener el Nombre de Fabian Robles/Alvaro y Carmen Becerra/Nadia, en el Elenco, cosa que me molesto un poco, ya que es Fabian Robles es el Villano Principal de la Telenovela al igual que Carmen Becerra, que hizo un Exelente Papel Antagonico, en la Entrada esta el nombre de Fabian Robles, pero no el de Carmen Becerra, ya que ella ingreso al elenco tiempo despues y quedo en lugar de Alejandra Avalos/Cassandra, pero en la tapa trasera del Dvd no estan estos 2 nombres, detalle importante, para tener en cuenta, sobre todo los editores del Dvd.
Tambien note que no esta la escena de la apuesta que Gabriel hace con Justo, en la cual le gana el Diamante, es la segunda escena de la Novela, en la transmision original, pero en el Dvd la quitaron, y al tiempo aparece Justo a vengarse, cosa que si uno no la vio antes, no entiende porque reaparece.
Esta Produccion cuenta con un Gran Elenco y se nota el gran trabajo y la destreza de los actores, en cuanto a sus actuaciones, es una Novela muy buena y que ademas te mantiene pendiente, y en ningun momento pierde la emocion, la adrenalina, eso fue lo que me gusto mucho y el motivo por el cual la vi y la compre.
Me hubiese gustado que el Resumen tubiera Mas Horas, algun Extras, Bloopers, Entrevistas, Detras de Camaras etc... Solo tiene una Galeria Fotografica, Trayectoria de Actores y un Trailer, que por cierto, es otro error que se les paso y se les olvido poner que lo trae en los Extras jaja.",1298419200,,2089,4.372750642673521
2517106,2,B000EDWLQ4,"Ok. You think you get all of the telenovela that you watched on tv, well you don't. When you watch it on DVD;if you've watched on tv; you can tell where there are parts missing. Thinking I shouldn't have bought it.",1290556800,,214,4.2439024390243905
2517107,4,B000EDWLQ4,I too love Apuesta por un Amor and was shocked that so much was edited out of the DVD.  I would like to know where I can buy the version with no deletions.  I love this show!  It is awesome.,1248393600,,190,3.7

2517113,5,B000EDWLQ4,"This novela has a tight plot that ticks along quickly.  The cast are all good, and the locations are fabulous.

The main character's hacienda is actually a Starwood boutique hotel in the Yucatn, called ""Hacienda Temozn.""  ($400/night: check it out online.  It's beautiful.  George and Laura Bush stayed there as guests of Felipe Caldern and his wife, Margarita.)

I can't vouch for the DVD, but I'd rather give a positive review to encourage at least getting a little bit of the show, if someone can't watch the entire novela.",1206403200,,526,4.853932584269663
2517114,5,B000EDWLQ4,"This like all the telenovelas you'll get on DVD, it is heavily edited. I look forward to the day, likely years from now, when I will be able to purchase subtitled telenovelas in their complete form. That will most always be at least a couple dozen disc = costly. I own several of the Xenon novelas and Apuesta is definitely one of the smartest editing jobs. Apuest is more like watching a mini-series. Xenon didn't thrown in a lot of non sequitur scenes of subplots, involving characters, totally unrelated to the the central stories of hero and heroine, that would leave the viewer wondering, 'Who are these people and why are they saying and doing these things?' ...Xenon certainly has a history of such rough editing.
Apuesta's characters aren't overblown, i.e., two dimensional(cartoonlike), and the performances are WELL acted. The soundtrack hasn't been ""messed with"", the way they've done a few others. I'd say that overall, Apuesta is one of the top three I've viewed so far. After three years of studying Spanish grammar I am studying conversation. I don't own all those that are available with subtitles and there's a reason for that: My advice is to be wary of ANY novela edited to less than ten hours. It is simply impossible to put many weeks worth of a novela's original t.v. broadcast into so small a format, and not do so by way of an editing hackjob.",1205107200,3,1367,4.7238493723849375
8108677,5,B000EDWLQ4,This is a fast paced and wonderful love story.  It has english subtitles .  I wish Televisa would stop editing these stories and put them out as originally done..  Even with the editing it was great to watch.,1512086400,,208,4.421052631578948

8108681,3,B000EDWLQ4,"pretty good soap.

juan soler is a professional gambler who wins a ranch during a poker game. he takes over the ranch and allows the man and his family to stay and work it with him. the man's son is furious, but juan offers him half of the profits if he stays and helps and becomes his partner.

the man's son has always planned to marry the beautiful daughter of the rancher next door. however, juan soon falls in love with her and she responds. the first rancher's son also has a relationship with a pretty woman named butterfly, who wants him to marry her.

the second rancher is a widower who is seduced by a cunning woman into marrying her. she wants his money and maneuvers to gradually gain control of it. this second rancher has a no-good son. his wife discovers how rotten he is (a rapist, drunk and ne'er do well) and blackmails him into helping her. he soon likes the idea of gaining access to his father's money through his stepmother. she convinces the rancher to change his will to leave everything to his first grandchild with his wife administering the money for the child. she then advises the bad son to find a woman, get her pregnant, marry her, and they can enjoy the money the grandchild inherits. the rancher dies.

meanwhile, juan and the second rancher's daughter marry, but she only marries him because her father is in terrible financial trouble (before he dies) and juan can fix that. she won't admit that she loves juan, and refuses to be a wife to him in more than name. their relationship is volatile and they break up and come back together. during a break up, he has a brief relationship with a young woman who becomes pregnant. she wants to revenge herself when he goes back to his wife after telling her he would marry her.

his wife then has a baby (the heir to the whole fortune), and they are happy for a while, but the baby is believed dead after a fire and the mother becomes too depressed to continue their marriage.",1442880000,,1956,4.437325905292479

8108683,5,B000EDWLQ4,"Apuesta por un amor (Betting on Love - 590 minutes)

A gambler, Gabriel  (Juan Soler), wins a ranch in a poker game but agrees to return it to the loser if the loser's dynamic daughter Julia Montao (Patricia Mantriola), marries him. She shows up at the ceremony an hour late, drunk as a skunk. When the vows reach ""I do,"" the best man runs in, also drunk and tries to stop the ceremony; the ushers nab him and drag him back outside of the church.

When the minister declares them husband and wife, she sways toward the groom and says, ""So that's it then, huh?"" When he says it is, she shakes his hand and gives him a firm pat on the cheek, then staggers down the aisle out of the church. When she shows up hours later at her new home, she has showered and is sort of sober. The housemaids obediently line up outside and toss a few pathetic flower petals at her. The groom had a painting of his bride placed in her bedroom which she promptly shoots with her rifle. I howled with laughter!

As usual, Juan Soler generates a LOT of sexual heat with his co-star and is convincing as a manly man who sometimes loses control. I like the Professor (Alfonso Iturralde) who is blackmailed into painting (TWICE!) a nude of one of Gabriel's former lovers Eva (Mnika Snchez) otherwise known as Mariposa (""The Butterfly""). (She's TROUBLE with a capital ""T."")

We have a nicely tense sexless marriage (Julia was traumatized as a child when she witnessed a rape), confessions of evil deeds, many regrets and pleas for forgiveness, exceedingly bad villains and villainesses, a kidnapping, shootings, hijacking on the highway, ""Who's your Daddy?"" and appropriately tough punishments for all the bad guys. LOVE that well-deserved jail rape!

This one is definitely a cut above! I'm glad I own it, and I'm glad I didn't see the original series, that way I don't know what I'm missing. (I got my DVDs from Amazon.)",1381708800,,1894,4.572271386430678
8108684,5,B000EDWLQ4,"Like Refugio del amor, I have enjoyed Apuesta por un Amor because it has helped me to become fluent in Spanish in just 5 months. I relax, riding my bicycle, and just enjoy. I find that if I use subtitles or try to understand each word, I get lost and don't get anything at all. By just listening, huge blocks of the language flow into my mind, and I learn whole expressions and sentences.
  Apuesto por un Amor is not the greatest plot, but it's fun. Like the other telenovelas I've watched, or listened to, I learn so much about the culture - what the Spanish-speaking consumers want from a film. I guess el sbado gigante on T.V. says it all - la gente (people) want a film that's muy emocionante! I've never seen so many people cry so much! I wonder if they have some sort of fluid the actor can make flow from his eyes in huge streams. In any case, I have the impression that it's okay for Mexican men to cry, and I think that's not a bad thing.",1364688000,,948,4.174863387978142

8108686,3,B000EDWLQ4,"While I thorougly enjoyed the telenovela while it was being aired, the DVD is a huge dissapointment.  The've edited and cut so many parts of the storyline that it was difficult to follow.  Soledad story is completly cut.  You barely notice the brother who was such an evil character.  To many abrupt jumps.  I would definitely not recommend the DVD.  If you can find the original telenovela being broadcast I would highly recommend it.",1311552000,,435,4.8108108108108105
