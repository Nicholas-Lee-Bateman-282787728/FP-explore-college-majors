7924008,1,B00004UFF4,"The title of this VHS is confused with ""The T.V. Show"" directed by Tom Trbovich and starring Rob Reiner. The T.V. Show (1979) is very funny, but it is not on the tape listed as ""Gary Shandling Show: 25th / TV Show (1979)"", or associated with it in any way. Rob Reiner does not appear. (The Shandling tape was actually released in 1986). The following postings also have the same problem: Best of Soap / TV Show (1979), Funniest & Wackiest Commercials / TV Show (1979), Lawrenceville Stories / TV Show (1979), and Little Rascals Gift Set / TV Show (1979), all of which incorrectly list Tom Trbovich as director.",1139184000,3,610,4.554545454545455
