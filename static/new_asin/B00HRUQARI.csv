6201165,4,B00HRUQARI,"Pre-show match: Tag Team Champions Uso's VS Real Americans VS Rybaxel VS Los Matadors: Very good opener that was turned into a elimination match. Uso's retain in an action packed match & Ceasaro turns face by turning on Swagger.

Hulk Hogan comes out to start the show & Stone Cold & Rock join as they cut a lengthy promo.

Triple H VS Daniel Bryan: Maybe it was predictable, this match was still very exciting & I enjoyed the finish. Triple H attacks Bryan afterwards so he is weakened for the main event

N.A.O & Kane VS The Shield: Very rushed match with Shield winning.

Andre The Giant Battle Royal: Hey, how do you solve a problem every year because many talents are being left off the big event because of promo's & music concerts. Easy, put a battle royal & throw everyone in who doesnt have a match. Big Show was the favorite but Ceasaro ends up winning, very happy for him, & hope to see him as a future world champion.

Superman VS Bray Wyatt: With all the momentum of the Wyatt family going in, it should be their time to shine. However, Cena ends up winning in what some consider an upset. I'm sure Wyatt will beat Cena at the next PPV but it's not the same.

The Hall of famers are introduced & Warrior gets his music.

Undertaker VS Brock Lesnar: What a friggin shocker. I watched this live & could tell what moves were about to happen. The match wasn't bad but very predictable with what moves were coming up. The ending was a shocker & will go down as one of the top 10 moments in WrestleMania history as the crowd's reaction was priceless. I even felt a little sad at seeing this streak end. He took way too much time leaving the ring though. Brock wins the streak, will brag about it on Raw, & leave for another few months.

Women's Match: AJ Lee retains her belt in a chaotic match.

World Champion Randy Orton VS Batista VS Daniel Bryan: Started off fine but dragged in the middle as Triple H, Steph, & Scott Armstrong try to screw Bryan but fail. Afterwards Bryan is driven thru a table by Orton & Batista as it takes at least five mintues till the action picks up as Bryan is stretchered out of the arena. He returns & the action resumes with Bryan making Batista tap out & the confetti goes off. Cut out the middle of the match & it was good.

Overall, another all out event by WWE. If you got the network then this event is a steal. This will be talked for years either about for Bryan finally win the gold or Taker's streak ending. Highly recommend this event & hope WWE can keep up the momentum.

Follow-up: After a night of thinking it over, this should be the Attitude era's swan song as one wrestler writer wrote. I love seeing Stone Cold, The Rock, Undertaker, etc but it's time to step aside & let the future take center stage. The past few WrestleMania's have been overblown events featuring people who only wrestle a few times a year while the guy's who bust there ass night in & night out have to sit out back & watch. I like The Rock but his last two comeback bids have been a joke, going as far as asking for a title shot months in advance, & then winnning it. This year they just stuffed the unused in a Battle Royal. The Shield & Daniel Bryan dominated the main events of Raw & Smackdown last year & did a good job. Ceasaro & Wyatt Family are growing a rabid fan base & you've got a rookie system in NXT that everyone is raving about. Yea I like the older stars but WWE needs to evolve & put wrestling back into the main stream. This was a good start & hope they keep it up.",1396742400,5,3513,4.244011976047904

Loved to see Hogan with Stone Cold and The Rock.",1396742400,2,119,5.0
6201167,4,B00HRUQARI,"Preshow: The Uso's (C) vs Cesaro and Swagger vs the masked Primo and Epico vs Ryback and Axel: in an action packed match Primo and Epico were eliminated first by Swagger and the ankle lock. Then Ryback by Cesaro's finisher. The Uso's picked up the win on Cesaro with double splash.
  Swagger wasn't happy with Cesaro, put on the ankle lock but let go. Then Swagger tried to shake Cesaro's hand but got swung around the ring instead.

  Bryan vs Triple H: in an amazing match with many reversals and Triple H targeting Bryan's arm; Bryan won eventually with his running knee. Annoying Stephanie, then distracted Bryan with slaps to the face and Triple H then attacked his arm yet again.

  The Shield vs the New Age Outlaws and Kane: was so short I forgot about it. Ended with a triple powerbomb.

Andre the Giant Battle Royal: Big Show was a obvious choice to win but Cesaro got a huge win by throwing Show over the top for a huge deserving win.
  Bray vs Cena: Bray had a creepy but cool entrance, Cena just came out with a new corny shirt, same ole Cena. Bray was impressive and the fans were even rooting for him. But since Cena just doesn't have it in him to put over someone fresh, he won with the AA. Bray will now probably be the next Ryback. A win over Cena at WM would have been huge for his career but no, Cena can't do it, nor can the WWE. Lawler then said the entire WWE universe is happy Cena won as the brainwashing continues.
  Undertaker vs Lesnar: in one of the best matches of the night these two put on a fine match full of reversals of submission moves. And Brock even reversing Old School into the F5, Undertaker kicked out though. While Lesnar eventually kicked out of a tombstone.
  Lesnar eventually shocked the world by winning with the F5. I expected Cena to do it next year but thank god it wasn't him. Still, if Lesnar was the one to end it, then he needs to wrestle full time and not as a part time player. Since right now, I can't say he deserved it much.
  Undertaker though was probably just ready not to wrestle anymore. I mean, he wasn't even sure his injuries would allow him to be a WM this year.

  AJ defending the Divas title vs pretty much every diva: AJ made Naomi submit for the win.

  Daniel Bryan vs Batista vs Orton (C): Bryan was beaten and bruised but showed up anyway. Batista and Orton wanted it to be one on one by constantly trying to take out Bryan. Triple H and Stephanie even got involved with a paid off ref but Bryan took them all out; even Triple H with his own sledgehammer.
  But Orton and Batista singled out Bryan again and hit a Batista bomb into a neck breaker version of the RKO through the announce table.
  Bryan still came back to win with a Yes Lock on Batista. Hopefully there's no more short reigns or the belt be stripped from him. And hopefully greedy Cena isn't in a hurry for his next reign. Let Bryan have a long reign!",1396742400,4,2895,4.283609576427256

WRESTLEMANIA 30

Mania is always the biggest card of the year and I think that they have been getting better as the years have gone by recently. I always enjoy them but really look forward to the Hall of Fame during Mania weekend. Any way this was a really good Mania with some great matches and a truly shocking moment.

1. TRIPLE H VS DANIEL BRYAN-the opening match of the night would determine who would go on to the main event and make it a triple threat match for the WWE Championship. Triple H really did not want Bryan as champion so he came back to take him out and stop his championship dreams. This was a great opening match which felt like a Mania match. Bryan would mix his offense well from straight wrestling to his flying moves. Hunter would work over Bryan's injured shoulder and arm throughout the match. The ending would come with Bryan winning after hitting his knee, the fans were super into this match. Triple H would attack Bryan after the match.

2. NEW AGE OUTLAWS & KANE VS THE SHIELD-this match was way to short in my opinion as I love all of these guys. Still even though it was a squash match it felt like a Mania match as well, one of those old school blowouts. The Shield destroyed the Outlaws and Kane with various dives, punches, spears and so on. The match ends with a special triple powerbomb and Rollins getting the pin. Short but entertaining match, still wish it would have been more competitive.

3. ATGM BATTLE ROYAL-this was the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal with every other superstar who wasn't on the card in this. I am a huge fan of battle royals so naturally this was really fun for me. There were some great moments here like Kofi staying alive even after getting thrown out, takes advantage of a rule. There were some surprise eliminations including the very last one that makes Cesaro the first ever winner of the match.

4. BRAY WYATT VS JOHN CENA-the match I was looking forward to the most as I love Bray and thought the build up to this match was excellent. The video package before the match is still one of my all time favorite ones they have ever done. This like the others felt like a Mania match and was a great match between the two. Great back and forth action with Bray trying to get Cena to turn against his values and become a heel. Various times Bray was close to doing so and also winning the match but John stayed true to himself. In the end a reversal would lead to a John Cena win but Bray was excellent here, great match.

5. UNDERTAKER VS BROCK LESNAR-ah yes the match that everyone is still talking about. When this match went down I couldn't believe that Taker lost this match. Looking back at it now I don't mind it at all. In fact looking at the crowd reaction I kinda like it and think it is funny. The match was great with all kinds of brawling and power moves thrown around. Of course three f-5's later Brock would pick up a huge win over Taker. This was a fun match and a Mania moment like no other. Of course what happened afterwards backstage was very serious and I am glad that Taker is ok.

6.[DIVAS TITLE]DIVAS INVITATIONAL-this match had all the Divas in it going for the title as Vickie wanted AJ to lose it badly. They were all in the ring at once and battled all over the place including a great moment for the Bella's. Still AJ retains the belt despite what Vickie wanted.

7.[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS BATISTA VS DANIEL BRYAN-the main event of the evening would see the champ defend against the Rumble winner and a winner from earlier in the night. Bryan was already injured but fought with everything he had. Batista used his power and size to take them out while Orton did all he could to try and retain the strap. All three men would get near counts and break up finishes, Bryan at one point looked like he was out. But Bryan would return to tap out Batista and gain the title.

BONUS

8.[TAG TITLESTHE USOS VS LOS MATADORES VS THE REAL AMERICANS VS RYBACK & CURTIS AXEL-I do not understand how this match was not a part of the main card. It was regulated to the pre show but this was a great opening match. The action is fast paced with all four teams being highlighted here. Great opening with plenty of quick tags with Los Matadores being eliminated first. The match gets a little more hard hitting after that but surprisingly the hardest hitters get eliminated next as Ryback and Axel get sent packing. From there it isn't long before the Uso's get the win in a hard fought great opener that should have been on the show.

Naturally you also get the entire Hall of Fame highlighted by the late Ultimate Warrior, along with various behind the scenes stuff and videos. This was one of the best Mania's in a while. I liked every match really and loved a few. There were legit surprises and some feel goof moments..",1421712000,,4817,4.389013452914798

6201234,5,B00HRUQARI,"Wrestlemania XXX was held at the Superdome on April 6th, 2014 in New Orleans, LA and it began with a meeting of legends. Hulk Hogan had his senior moment and forgot where he was and The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin sure had fun pointing that out to him but what a great way to kick off the event. In many ways, Wrestlemania 30 is a celebration of a by gone era and ushering in a new one. I will not review every single moment but highlight a few of them:

Daniel Bryan's come to the top.

For a few months, the Authority has stacked the deck against Daniel Bryan as he attempts to fulfill his dream but being WWE Champ, people got tired of ""Hustle, Loyalty and Respect"" and wanted a few face to support and believe in and Daniel Bryan rose to the challenge. He is likable and a great wrestler, he can polarize the crowd like nobody on the current roster and he can bring people to their feet and let children believe, this can be them, they can achieve their dreams, you don't have to be a tall, muscular guy to be a superstar, to be a champion, all you have to do is just be yourself and no matter how many set backs you face in life, keep your focus on your goals and nobody can stop you.

He match with Triple H set off a good pace for the show and it was easily one of the best matches on the card, DB had to wrestle once more in the main event but when he finally won the title on the grandest stage of them all, you could feel a part of you uplifted as a new era of WWE began.

The Hall of Fame class of 2014

As a bonus, you get to see the Hall of Fame for 2014 as an extra on the blu-ray disc set, this alone with worth the price. It was nice to see Lita again and her stories were entertaining, Mr. T really went over board on his speech and I think people took a bathroom break for Carlos Colon's speech, most people did not know who he was or how he contributed to the WWE (look him up on wikipedia) Scott Hall's speech was short and sweet but clearly 2 men stole the show, the first and perhaps the most emotional one was Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts. Diamond Dallas Page introduce Jake with some funny stories and had the audience feeling good and then Jake came out and took us for a ride, his speech was filled with humor, love, sadness and regret and we started off feeling good and Jake pulled us in towards the darkness that haunts him, he does take us back into the light and when we see him introducing his children and grandchildren, you can see the light in his eyes and feel the hope and redemption in his heart.

The Ultimate Warrior

Everybody had big expectations for this speech, Linda McMahon's speech seemed kind of forced but all that faded away when the Warrior took the stage. Everybody knew of the hate and anger between the WWE and Ultimate Warrior, after all, he was the only superstar the WWE went out of their way to bash on DVD, not even Macho Man got such a treatment, everybody was excited and nervous to hear what he had to say, Warrior gave credit to many people back stage that helped him out in his career, he gave credit to many of the superstars he worked with, even the Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase got praised from the Warrior (Ted Dibiase had for years spoken poorly of the Warrior and you could see the look of regret on his face afterwards), Warrior mainly addressed the current superstars to think of their lives outside the ring and you can see the years of anger fade away as the Warrior spoke, sadly, 2 days later, the Warrior would depart this world and return to Parts Unknown, but it is nice he made peace with the WWE before his passing.

Last,.............Brock Lesnar vs Undertaker

This is my favorite match of the night, I wanted to see Undertaker go down for many years but then I started to root for him (especially against Shawn Michaels and Triple H) and I thought CM Punk would break the streak so when Brock Lesnar was chosen to face the Deadman, I did not expect too much. I am big Brock Lesnar fan especially after he punked John Cena after Wrestlemania 28 and I hoped he would win.....and I was right and I loved the look on the crowd's face, I was probably one of the very few who jumped for joy and celebrated when the referee counted 1...2..3. The match was pretty standard and a lot of people paid no attention, Brock did his offense and the Undertaker recovered slowly and then Undertaker did his comeback and people were just waiting for the inevitable but then I noticed something, Brock kept coming and the Undertaker took a hell of a bump that took out all his energy, his will to fight, the Deadman was done. I watched in silence as did the crowd when the referee counted and Undertaker did not kick out. A new era had begun, no more streaks, no more Undertaker, nothing is certain in today's WWE, heroes are not invincible anymore and a new threat has been unleashed.

Wrestlemania 30 is one of the best, it had its slower moments (Cena vs Wyatt) but all in all, a good watch, a must own and it is clearly a gift to wrestling fans young and old and people will still talk about for years to come.",1416873600,,5081,4.228865979381443

6201237,5,B00HRUQARI,"Wrestlemania 30 was my first ever live WWE experience. I enjoyed it immensely and it was only natural that I get this.

Firstly, if you are into additional content, you will be disappointed this Blue Ray DVD. With the exception of the awesome Pre-show tag title bout, there really isn't anything added. The WWE Network features some additional features such as superstar interviews and such, so it might be better you spend your money on that, rather than get this DVD.

If however, you are willing to sacrifice the extras for one of the best wrestling events ever, this is for you!

The show kicks off with three legendary icons in the business, to a brilliant wrestling match between Daniel Bryan and Triple H, for the opportunity to get into the main event. The New Age Outlaws and Kane made a brief appearance in an effort to hang with the new dogs of the yard, the Shield... who managed to carve out an epic Wrestlemania moment.

If that wasn't enough, the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal will leave you breathless with one of the most poetic endings in WWE History, reminiscent of Hulk Hogan body slamming Andre the Giant!

War can be fought in many ways and John Cena found himself entering the Superdome locked in Psychological Warfare against the Wyatt Family.

Then after 21 years of dominating the Granddaddy of em all, The Undertaker seeks to add to The Streak, but by no means is it an easy task. For he has never faced a Beast Incarnated in the form of Brock Lesnar! Here comes the pain.

AJ Lee then steps between the ropes to defend her Diva's Championship in an invitational Diva's match, certainly an opportunity for her to cement her place as the dominant female of the current product, or will the Total Divas reign supreme?

Then, the main event of the evening. The Authority's hand picked face of the company, and the WWE World Heavyweight Champion: Randy Orton, enters into the squared circle to defend his title against his former teammate: Dave Batista, chosen by the Authority to ensure that the main event of Wrestlemania would truly be what is ""best for Business"". Will they be able to achieve an all Authority main event by filling it out with The C.O.O, The Game: Triple H? Or did Daniel Bryan achieve his life long dream of reaching to the top, proving his doubters wrong, and not only enter into the main event of Wrestlemania 30, but capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship?",1416268800,,2420,4.664319248826291

6201271,3,B00HRUQARI,"I miss the big stars, the pageantry and National Anthem!

They used to have outside celebrities take part in WrestleMania. Remember Mr. T, Liberace, Mary Hart, Bob Ucher, The NFL Players and Vanna White? I miss all that. I miss back when the world's biggest celebs cared about WrestleMania or at least cashing the WtsrestleMania check.

They used to sing the National Anthem. It wasn't on this disc.

They used to come out on special carts, with huge entourages and great ceremony. Not anymore. I guess the WWE thinks we don't deserve the kind of entertainment we used to get.

Frankly, I miss the kind of talent they used to be able to show. Now their best performers (in my not-so-humble opinion) are the older ones like The Undertaker and Chris Geritol, I mean Jericho, John Senile, Cena. This generation just aint that great. I'm tired of them. I bought this disc only because I have a complete WrestleMania set and it would not be complete without this one. I was not really that impressed with it as a show.

For instance, it was highly publicized that Hulk Hogan would ""host"" WrestleMania and he is on the cover in wrestling gear, but he is only one screen for very little time. He's not a commentator. They don't go to him much. He does next to nothing.

You can read other reviews for specifics on the matches. I don't reveal results in case you haven't seen it yet, and I didn't find them that compelling.

Here's what WrestleMania needs to make me actually look forward to it : The National Anthem, honoring America with it's actual real anthem, the biggest celebrities in the world, the huge entry ceremonies and carts, the background videos for the matches, and most of all compelling current talent that I would care about. I mean C.M. Punk and Daniel Bryan. Really? You call that talent in a company that had Hogan. Andre, DiBiase, Hitman, Diesel, Michaels, Flair and the like? Maybe I'm just the old one. Maybe folks should disregard everything I write and say.",1406592000,,1977,4.64756446991404

6201283,5,B00HRUQARI,"April 6th, 2014 will go down as the most emotional - and traumatizing - night in my life as a pro wrestling fan.  It was the end of a rollercoaster that first began at SummerSlam in 2013.  It was the end of a four month period of uncertainty that began when a certain superstar ""punked"" out of WWE.  More so than anything, it was the end of an era.

Let's face it - the 2014 Royal Rumble set in motions the events that led to this card taking place the way it did.  Batista was springboarded to winning the Royal Rumble match after having around eight minutes of television time following his return from a four year absence.  This action angered fans who had been clamoring for Daniel Bryan to ascend to the top of the mountain, and the fans themselves let WWE have it.  In my personal opinion, it was that action that also led to CM Punk quitting the night after the Rumble, which in turn threw WWE's plans for the 30th anniversary of WrestleMania into complete disarray.

Instead of avoiding the problem, they faced it - and fixed it.  On the biggest show that they will have for the next five years, WWE focused on the next generation of superstars.  A team of three rogue superstars took the chance to bury the Attitude Era forever.  A battle royal named after the man who was larger than life gave way for many a young talent - one in particular - a chance to have their name etched in history forever.  An enigmatic, creepy, and hungry young man, not even a full year on the main roster, got his chance to face the biggest name in the business on the biggest show of the year.  Most importantly, above all else, WWE took one of the greatest risks of all, and centered its 30th anniversary show around one bearded individual, who would more than likely be competing in two matches, against three of the biggest names of all.  As the slogan said, the good times were certainly rolling.

Opening segment - Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, and The Rock
I'll admit - when I saw Hogan come out, I prayed that he hurried up, mainly because I wanted as much time given to Daniel Bryan as possible.  Nonetheless, the segment won me over when Austin came out...and then The Rock showed up.  This segment got better over time, and it was certainly one of the most feel good moments you'll see all year.  The nostalgia was definitely there, and being witness to the three biggest stars in pro wrestling history standing in the same ring at the same time was a moment in time that will most likely never be replicated.  Also...kudos to Hogan for turning the Silverdome botch into a joke that lasted well throughout the night.

Triple H vs. Daniel Bryan - winner advances to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship Triple Threat Main Event
There were times during the eight months that this match was built up that I honestly felt like giving up as a fan.  Daniel Bryan had been booked so terribly since SummerSlam that I had given up hope that he would get a payoff.  I'm really glad I'll held on so that I could see this match.  First off, that video package was gold.  We already know who Triple H is, and how he got to this point - but to see Bryan's journey that started back on the first season of NXT was truly something.  Onto the match itself - and what a match it was!  My pick for match of the night, and honestly match of the year.  It's crazy to say that, cause with a rivalry as intense as this one was, the match was fairly simple.  It was a straight wrestling match, which was refreshing to see, and a good choice overall.  The psychology in the match was excellent, as HHH worked on Bryan's injured arm the whole match, and even though this finish was never in doubt, he had you thinking that the main event was going to be an Evolution reunion.  Nonetheless, Bryan pinned The Game clean in the middle of the ring for the victory.  A perfect way to start the night, and it's definitely the winner for best wrestling match of the night.  At this point, I knew how the show would end, but that post match attack had me screaming at my television.  10/10

Six Man Tag Team Match - The Shield vs. Corporate Kane and the New Age Outlaws.
Sometimes, symbolism can make a two minute match golden.  That's what this match was - symbolism for the end of the Attitude Era.  The Shield had just completed their face turn a few weeks prior, and they were one of the hottest acts in the company.  This match was good for the time given to it, and it served its purpose in making The Hounds of Justice look dominant.  Btw...I love Corporate Kane more than most.  6/10 (for the length, match itself was good.)

Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal
A match that starts with 30 men in the ring at the same time doesn't sound too appealing.  And it wasn't...until it got down to the wire.  Once the fodder was taken out of the equation, and the big boys were left standing (Sheamus, Del Rio, Big Show, Ziggler, Cesaro, Kingston, etc.) the match really picked up steam.  Of course, it had memorable and funny moments throughout - Fandango's dancing, Kofi's near save from being eliminated (again), and so on.  The moment that makes this match is the ending - and the moment that created the next big star.  For a guy who wasn't originally in this match, Cesaro certainly made his presence felt.  And powerslamming Big Show over the top rope as effortlessly as he did was beautiful.  The crowd ate it up, and the Swiss Superman etched his name in WM history as the first winner of the Andre the Giant Battle Royal.  7/10

John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt
Psychology is a lost art in wrestling.  This match brought it back tenfold, and showed it off like no other match has in recent memory.  First off...Mark Crozer playing the Wyatts to the ring.  Nuff said.  Seeing John Cena in a midcard match was very odd, but his time wasn't now.  Anyway, onto the match - wow.  What a story told.  It was almost like wrestling's version of The Dark Knight.  Cena playing the hero of the day, while Wyatt played the role of the deranged psychopath hell bent on making the good guy cross that line.  The first minute of this match was haunting, as Wyatt simply dropped to his knees, begging Cena to take him out.  Great stuff.  The rest of the match played out just like that - facial expressions, body movements, master psychology.  Aside from that, this was one physical ride of a match.  You could feel the anger coming from Cena, as he fought within himself not to do something he would regret, as Wyatt simply laughed at the entire situation.  Now, many have disagreed with Cena coming out victorious, but I'm okay with it - yes, Bray Wyatt is my 2nd favorite guy, but having him beat John freaking Cena this early in his time on the main roster wouldn't be a good choice.  This match proves that a loss can be just as good as a win.  Bray Wyatt showed why he is one of the brightest prospects on the roster, as he hung tooth and nail with the biggest star in the world, and helped carry Cena to what was a masterful story.  8.5/10

The Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar
I'll get to the result in just a moment, but right now I want to talk about what no one talks about when it comes to this match - the match itself.  Yes, this was certainly not on the scale of the matches that the Undertaker had with Shawn Michaels and Triple H in years past.  But the match was, in my opinion, still good.  And the story that it told was incredible, unbelievable, and truly tragic.  Paul Heyman had spoke in the weeks building to this event that The Undertaker was getting old, and that Brock Lesnar would expose that age by conquering the Streak.  That's what this match accomplished -albeit unintentionally, perhaps.  As we all know, the Deadman suffered a concussion early on, which killed the pace of the match...or did it?  Planned or not, the way the match played out was beautifully tragic.  One moment stands out - Lesnar standing in front of the Undertaker, leaning against the ropes, and just punching away at him.  It was like watching an old dog try to run after the Frisbee, but he can't anymore.  The racing horse, that had won for decades, was finally running out of gas.  Aside from the psychology, the match was very physical, and both men took a hell of a lot of damage.  The match ended after a third F5 from Lesnar which put the Undertaker down...and here's where I dissect the result.  As long as I live, I will never forget where I was when the Streak ended.  Every year, I count along with the finisher, waiting for the Undertaker to kick out.  This time, he didn't.  My jaw was on the floor for what seemed like forever.  I thought there was a botch.  I thought I was dreaming.  But, no, it happened.  21-1.  Legitimately, the most shocking moment in professional wrestling history, and I dare any future wrestler to try and top that.  As for the result itself - at first, I hated it.  The Streak breaking is something that never comes to mind.  It could never happen.  And for one, the build never once hinted at it happening.  Ric Flair's match with Shawn Michaels at WM XXIV was built up to obviously show that Flair was leaving.  WM XXVI was built up to show that Shawn Michaels was going to retire.  Not once was WM XXX built up to show that The Undertaker would take his guns and go home a loser.  But it happened.  And as a long time fan of pro wrestling, I was, and still am, saddened to see my all time favorite guy lose the way he did.  As a fan of the current product, it seems like Lesnar is on his way to becoming WWE World Heavyweight Champion, and to do so, he needs to be built up as a world eater, a killer...a conqueror.  And this match accomplished just that.  One things for sure - the end result of this match will have fans talking for years to come, and it will have fans ask the question ""Where were you when the Last Outlaw fell to the Beast?""  8/10

Vickie Guerrero Divas Invitational for the Divas Championship
When I watched this event live, I barely had my attention on this match, due to the wind being taken out of me by the Streak being broken.  I went back and watched the event, and found myself skipping this match.  I guess it served its purpose as filler before the main event.  And all of the Divas got their spotlight on the card.  Also, it's trolly as hell watching AJ retain her title, beating every woman on the main roster in one night.  Too bad, a certain Anti-Diva would come a knocking one night later.  4/10 (for effort alone.)

Triple Threat Match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship - Randy Orton (c) vs. Batista vs. Daniel Bryan
Still saddened by the Undertaker's loss, my exact words were ""If Daniel Bryan loses, I will kill myself.""  Not really, but you get it.  Kudos to Rev Theory for a kickass performance of Randy Orton's theme song.  Now...I'll admit that as I watched Orton and Batista walk to the ring, I had my doubts.  This was it - the make or break it moment.  Would WWE stick to the same old song and dance and give the win to one of two established stars...or would they make a leap of faith and create a new megastar?  The match told as emotional of a story as it gets.  With every near fall that Bryan got in, I was on the edge of my seat.  With every near fall that Batista or Orton got in, I got more frustrated.  For the first time in a long time, I legitimately didn't know what was going to happen.  The match itself was awesome, and it reminded me of an old school Attitude Era brawl, which was a nice touch.  Triple H's interference was needed, as you knew he wasn't done with D-Bry this night.  I must say - the sledgehammer shot to the Game was more rewarding than watching him lose to Bryan earlier in the night.  From there, things got chaotic.  That Batista Bomb-Neckbreaker combo (seriously, that wasn't an RKO) was sick to watch, and the announcers played that up perfectly.  Some say that it was not a believable story that someone as small as Daniel Bryan couldn't come back off of a stretcher following a match with HHH, as well as the abuse he took in this match.  Never heard of adrenaline?  Or how about this young man was so determined to make his legacy felt that he would destroy himself to get what he wanted?  Now that's storytelling.  The ending was marvelous.  The Batista Bomb to Orton, with him rolling out of the ring, was ironic, as Orton, the reigning champion was a complete afterthought in the build up.  And then the Running Knee to Batista, and the Yes Lock.  That moment was the closest that I was to my TV, as I was screaming along with Michael Cole for the Animal to tap.  And he did.  And then came the end to a frustrating eight months that proves WWE tells the best stories in wrestling.  Perhaps they planned this the whole time?  Perhaps they planned on holding him down, until he grew so big that he would emerge victorious?  How awesome would that be!  Either way, watching Daniel Bryan celebrate, as WWE World Heavyweight Champion, on the biggest show WWE holds until 2019 was spectacular.  They took a chance on this bearded wild man, and it paid off.  10/10

By far, my favorite WrestleMania of all time, and I'd be shocked if it doesn't get mentioned as one of the greatest of all time.  Top to bottom, a perfect show in my opinion.  Each match had a job, and each match succeeded.  Bray Wyatt proved in a loss that he could hang with the top tier talent in the world.  Cesaro etched his first major moment in stone.  The Shield proved that tomorrow is today.  Brock Lesnar proved that anything is possible.  The Undertaker proved that he is the stepping stone in WWE forever.  And Daniel Bryan took center stage and continued on his way to becoming this generations Steve Austin.  Not bad for a WrestleMania without CM Punk.

I was so excited when I preordered it, because I thought I was getting a big book, and then to see a small book attached to the case, was very disappointing, plus by them attaching the book with the case, it left a gap, that can easily be crushed. I love how the three disk dvds of past Wrestlemanias are packed nicely, and could last for years to come. With  Wrestlemania XXX, being my first blu-ray Wrestlemania, my expectations were high on the overall package. I have to say that WWE puts more of an effort with three disk dvd sets, than two disk Blu-Ray. This makes no sense whatsoever to me, because Blu-Ray is a better quality of video, it should be presented in a package that says so.

I did enjoy the fact that this Blu-Ray set  was loaded with extras, and the mere fact that I had Wrestlemania on one disk, and The Hall Of Fame on another. In all realness, this is a Wrestlemania I could seat down and rewatch over and over again.",1403568000,2,1057,4.27

6201321,5,B00HRUQARI,"Although Wrestlemania XXX took place in New Orleans instead of New York's Madison Square Garden as #'s X & XX did, the presentation was outstanding...

The homage to the past was highlighted by ""host"" Hulk Hogan, who was of course, not only at the first WM in 1985, but the next 8 that followed. WM III was apparently on his mind, as he referred to the New Orleans Superdome as the ""Silverdome"", the Pontiac, Michigan venue that host 93,173 for WM III.  The appearance of ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, relating WM history in his own brand of speaking, followed by the appearance of perhaps the greatest mic promo athlete ever, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, set off a 20-minute mutual admiration society of these 3 WWE legends.  A promo spot for the WWE's ""Slam City"" figures featured wrestling legends Hacksaw Jim Duggan, ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase & my all-time fave, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat...

The ""present"" featured great matches including: Triple H vs. Daniel Bryan for the right to appear in the triple threat match for the WWE/World Championship against Batista and Randy Orton;  John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt ; a fatal 4-way match for the Tag Team Championship ; the 30-man Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal ; WWE's Divas were also represented in the Vickie Guerrero Invitation bout, in which the first of the Divas to score a fall would be Divas champion;  one of the most anticipated matches was Undertaker, with his 21-0 record at WM coming into the bout facing Brock Lesnar...Does the streak continue, or does Lesnar succeed where 21 before him have failed ?

The ""future"" is dtermined as the winners of these bouts emerge and make history.

Speaking of history, Disc 2 features the complete 2014 WWE Hall-Of-Fame ceremony, featuring Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, Carlos Colon, Razor Ramon, Lita, Paul Bearer (the late William Moody, inducted posthumously by his sons), the Legendary Mr. T. who appeared in WM's I & II and the headliner, The Ultimate Warrior, who would sadly pass away just a few days following this ceremony.

6201352,5,B00HRUQARI,"I'm not going to give a review of the blu-ray just my opinion of the event. I've been a wrestling fan all my life and I absolutely loved this event. The 3 legends at the beginning was a fantastic way to start this event. Set it off perfectly. Daniel Bryan and HHH's opening match might be one of the greatest opening matches in WM history (next to Bret vs. Owen at WM X). Cena vs. Wyatt delivered more than I thought it would, and The Shield match was what I expected. It was made to make them look unstoppable so mission accomplished. Now let's get to UT vs. Lesnar. A lot of people have different opinions about this match and after I learned that UT got a concussion at the beginning of the match it made me like this match more. Sure it wasn't as great as some in the past but it did what it was supposed to. Watching the crowds reaction after the match is great. One of the biggest shockers in WWE of all time. The battle royal gave us a new star in the form of a new babyface named Cesaro. The main event was electric and entertained me from beginning to end. DB holding the belts up at the end was the only way this PPV could have ended. Fantastic match. This WM delivered on so many levels I absolutely loved it. People that are hating on it probably aren't die hards like some of us are or maybe they want the shock and awe booking of TNA/Vince Russo. If you happened to miss this PPV pick up the DVD/Blu-Ray.

-3:30 hours....
-a handfull of matches some going minutes while others go almost 60 minutes.  The days of more than 6 matches seems to be over.
-ridiculously long enterances, none of which are any good.  HHH and Wyatt's being the worst, I felt embarrassment.
-the new trend of music acts playing while wrestlers people want to see are sandwiched into a batttle royal
-30 minute opening promo with Hulk, Rock and Austin that has no point or purpose.
-backstage crap, that is just sad.  Sgt Slaughter playing with action figures...seriously...
-Undertaker loses, not the problem, the horrible match is the problem, diva's match might even have been better and it was pretty bad
-Bryan overkill, it was nice to see him get the title, but you had to watch him for 1/3rd the show, also what happened to all his moves?  He is regulated to drop kick after drop kick, kick after kick.  How many times can you see a running leg lariet in one night?
-Cena over...as usual...like getting any new guys a credible would kill the guy
It's not all bad, the battle royal might have been the best in years, fun spots but all the guys probably would have made the show great if given the chance to have matches.  Orton actually made the main event, did all the work and looked great.  Still not enough to make this show worth buying.",1398729600,5,1418,4.551181102362205
6201356,5,B00HRUQARI,"Like  most ""sporting"" events, this show was even better on TV than it was live. I was fortunate enough to be here for my first Mania and had an amazing time. I watched it on the network a few days later and I think this is one more than worth owning. I will go down the show and provide entertainment and match ratings.  Entertainment ratings (ER) are more for traditional wwe fans who like the spectacle and attend more to how the match plays in its storyline while match (MR) ratings are for us super wrestling nerds who care way too much about the little stuff, attending more to storytelling and re-watch value.

Opening Segment
ER: *****
MR: NA
Not much to say about this. It was a lot of fun.  Hogan, Austin, and The Rock all had a great time riffing off one another and hyping the show.  I am glad they weren't really involved in the action, but they were there and they made a lot of people happy.

Daniel Bryan v HHH
ER: ****
MR: ****3/4
I am a little higher on this match than most I have seen, but not much. This was a fantastic wrestling match and NOTHING was going to follow it.  This felt like a GHC title match, lots of cool slams, attention to detail, tons of emotion, and a big finish.  I would honestly say, if nothing else, this match makes the dvd/bluray worth getting. It was a great way to bring a head to the hottest feud in the WWE and is - to this point - American match of the year in my book. Further, I rank this in my top 5 wrestlemania matches ever.

Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal
ER: ****
MR: **1/2
Battle royals are hard to make great, but this was a really good one. The ending makes the whole thing worth it. I think Cesaro winning was enough to surprise a lot of people, but him picking up big show like that was nothing short of amazing.  From a building standpoint, my hat is off to Big Show in this one. He did everything he needed to do to make himself look like the only logical choice and when the time was right for Show to finally get a nod for all he has done for the E (especially at WM - Geesh) he put another guy over in the biggest way he could - effectively solidifying his rise to the top.  This was fun and had a big payoff. It isn't something to re-watch again and again, except the end.

The Shield vs Kane and New Age outlaws
ER: ***
MR: *
I am guessing that HHH and Bryan went over because this seemed like a throw away. I was hoping for more of a show from the Shield, but they got the smash win.  It was fun to see them run through some folks, but this was really really forgettable otherwise.

Bray Waytt vs John Cena
ER: ***3/4
MR: ***1/2
This match was better than a lot of people were saying. I was quite entertained by it. Cena is really good at what he does and Bray brought the creepy the entire match.  My biggest problem is that Cena held on to his facial expressions almost a little too long. It slowed down what was bound to be a somewhat slow match to begin with.  Neither man is the kind to carry someone to a great match, but both can do their part to make a good match great (see both their matches with Bryan). As for as pop-value, there is a lot to like about this. It wasn't the blowoff of a feud so Cena probably should have won. Bray used his new creepy crab walk in the best way possible.

Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar
ER: ***
MR: ***
This match isn't half as bad as ppl say. Is it great? no.  But it made sense. The story they were trying to tell was that Brock was too much for an aging taker, that his power and his youth were just too much for the old cowboy. It was a sad story, a tragic story.  Unfortunately, the audience thought it was going to get another epic john wayne shoot out where the good guy wins. THe match was slow because taker is slow (and he got concussed early), but Brock took care of him. I hear ppl saying he was too rough; watch that again. Watch how careful Brock is after the first 1/4 of the match, when he realizes taker is banged up. If anything, that is what made a slow match REALLY slow.  Plus, I am pretty sure Taker landed outside wrong to get that concussion. It didn't seem like Brock's fault.  In short, this is not the best match on the card but it might be the most historic. The ending is amazing because it feels like a shoot. They baited the audience beautifully and it felt real.  The audience left hating Brock Lesnar - mission accomplished.

Diva's Championship Match
ER: ** (I guess)
MR: 1/2
This was a mess. I give it to for ER because I assume some people were really stoked to see that many attractive women in one place.  For me, that is not what women's wrestling is about, but I am clearly in the minority as far as WWE's fans go.  Very forgettable.

Daniel Bryan vs Batista vs Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship
ER: ****1/2
MR: ****
This was everything it should have been.  Bryan was used just as much as he could be, logically. Batista and Orton did their part, and did a really good job telling a story that would cary over to the new Evolution storyline.  The action was somewhat frantic and a lot happened, but as far as a triple threat match in this storyline goes, this was really well executed. There were two false endings that had my heart skipping a beat, both of which really took this match from solid to very good.  The move to have Bryan come off the stretcher was smart. Finally, the end was worth the whole night and probably worth the 6 months of build up.  My only issue was that everyone expected Punk to return so there was a weird punk chant or two that I thought took away from Bryan and his rise to glory just a little (very little).

Overall: This is, to me, a great mania. First of all, a lot of big things happened. Moments that I think will be talked about 5-10 years from now.  Second, you get what I think is a top 5 mania match ever in HHH vs Bryan. Finally, the show - top to bottom - packs in the fun while telling some amazing stories.  This is a workrate era, people care about matches again and I think that is reflected in this mania.",1398643200,9,6032,4.154639175257732
6201357,5,B00HRUQARI,"I have no doubt that Wrestlemania XXX will fly off the shelves. Besides the brilliant Daniel Bryan-Triple H blow-off and Bryan's inspiring title win, most wrestling fans are aware of the significance of this event. Whether you agreed with the company's decision to end The Undertaker's famous win Mania win streak or not, its obvious that the result of the 'Taker-Brock Lesnar bout makes this a must-own. Plus, the inclusion of one of the most star-studded WWE Hall of Fame ceremonies puts the icing on the cake.
Wrestlemania XXX highlights:
1)Daniel Bryan, easily the most rabidly supported wrestler since the prime of Steve Austin, holds the Worlds title aloft as the entire arena chants ""Yes! Yes! Yes!""
2)The reaction from not just fans, but in particular Paul Heyman, when the ref slaps 3-resulting in the most controversial finish in a wrestling match since The Montreal Screwjob in 1997. (Personally speaking, I think it was a fantastic idea, and Lesnar was the perfect choice.)
3)The phenomenal 30 minute opener. Daniel Bryan and Triple H deliver the best Mania starter since Bret vs Owen two decades ago.
4)Jake Roberts' induction speech. Honest and inspiring, it simply solidified my feeling that Jake should have headlined this year's class.",1398384000,5,1252,5.11219512195122
6201358,5,B00HRUQARI,"This was a great WrestleMania because everything made it stand out and it was something different! Honestly, Undertaker and Brock Lesnar's match was the only bad match but Undertaker needed to end the streak. The whole Daniel Bryan and Authority storyline ended amazingly. This was a GREAT WrestleMania and I will definitely be buying it on Blu Ray when it releases. :)",1397520000,,369,4.967741935483871
6201359,5,B00HRUQARI,"So this is going to a review of the actual event itself and of course not the DVD because it's not out yet.  As far as the event itself goes, I thought it was a really good event but also maybe the saddest WM of all time due to what happened at the event itself and also what has happened since the event has went off the air.  I also would like to say that I watched this on the WWE network and I have to say, it ran pretty good for me.  There was one pause that occured during the main event but all I did was rewind it like TiVo and start it again and it played well for me the rest of the time.

The event started with perhaps one of the greatest promos or interview segments in wrestling history as Hulk Hogan, the host of WM, came out to address the crowd.  He was on his game except for calling the Superdome the Silverdome (WM III) twice.  After he spoke for a moment then Steve Austin came out to also speak to the crowd and Hogan.  After he was done, then the Rock came out to speak as well.  I mean here you have maybe the greatest star of the 80's in the ring with the greatest star of the 90's and the greatest star of the early 2000's.  I watched with my brother and just said to him, ""Imagine if these guys were 100 percent.  Imagine that Triple Threat match.  After that we got a package showing all the events that led up to the Triple H vs. Daniel Bryan match up.

So the opening match was a great one between Triple H and Bryan.  I don't know if it beats the WM 10 match with Bret and Owen but if not it came pretty darn close.  This match was back and forth and Bryan was really on his game (pun intended) that night.  I don't remember the last time I saw Triple H in the opening match of a major PPV but he was on as well.  I figure the reason he went on first is so he had the rest of the show to make sure everything else went off without a hitch seeings as how he pretty much runs the WWE nowadays.  Great contest that goes a little over 25:00 and well worth the price of the event itself.

After this match we see The New Age Outlaws and Kane take on The Shield.  I, like most, thought the Shield would break up during this match but that was not the case.  The WWE made the Shield look very strong to the point that they defeated Kane and the NAO in just over 2:00.  This was a pretty good match.

After that there was a backstage segment with some of the WWE Legends like Ricky Steamboat and Ron Simmons and some others.  Once that was over it was time for the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal.  First off, some of the guys that were originally supposed to be in the battle royal were not in it for whatever reason like Christian.  The eventually winner was a total surprise to me but man what a win for him as he actually scooped up the Big Show in a slam position and dumped him over the top rope to win.  This match was actually entertaining for a little over 13:00 and I was not expecting that.

After that we see all the events that led up to the Cena vs. Wyatt match and then it was the match itself.  First of all, I was kind of surprised that for the second straight WM Cena did not have a special entrance which is what he is usually known for.  Wyatt did have one and his was maybe the best entrance of the night.  The match itself was one of the best psychological matches I have ever seen.  It was back and forth and just a joy to watch.  The match went around 22:00 and while I thought it was good, I did think the wrong man went over.

So after that we see some of the segments of the Hall of Fame ceremony and then the intro of the Hall of Fame class of 2014 which featured Carlos Calone, Mr. T., Lita, Razor Ramon, Paul Bearer, Jake Roberts and of course the Ultimate Warrior.  The saddest part of this is knowing Warrior finally made it into the Hall and just days after taking his place we find that he has since died very suddenly.  In fact it was the day after his last appearance on Raw.  Very sad.  RIP Warrior.

After all of that we see the events that led up the Lesnar vs. Undertaker match.  What a freaking match with truly one of the biggest shocks in all of wrestling history.  I don't think I have ever witnessed 70,000 people take a collect gasp as they did when this match was over.  I know it's been all over the internet what with stories about it and some people actually have conspiracy theories about the match (for the love of God it was planned) so I think I can give the winner away.  Brock Lesnar does the unthinkable and actually ends the streak of Taker at 21 straight wins.  As I was watching and as I saw Brock hit his 3rd F5 on Taker I just knew Taker would kick out and hit a Tombstone and win for a 22nd time.  Never in a million years did I think the streak would end.  There are some that are saying that was Taker's last match and if it was, man what a hell of a way to go out.  For around 25:00 these two gave it their all and gave us a great contest.  Of course now the event is over we are finding out that Taker suffered a severe concussion and some possible minor neck injuries and that he collasped backstage once he left the ring.  For the first time in the history of WM Vince McMahon didn't see how the show ended because he elected to ride with Taker to the hospital.  WOW!

So after Taker and Brock successfully knocked the wind out of all of us, we got to witness the Vickie Guerrero Invitational for AJ Lee's Diva's title.  I'm not going to name everyone in it but there like 13 other Diva's in it.  The match was pretty good for a Diva's match and it was rather short clocking in at a little over 6:00.  Pretty good contest but honestly if there was one match to skip on this event, it would be that one.

After that match we get a backstage segment featured the participants of the first WM main event with Hogan, Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff (who I didn't even recongize at first) and Mr. T.  They finally put their differences behind them.  Lastly, we get to the Main Event which would have Daniel Bryan factor into it now along with Randy Orton and Batista.  This was actually a really good contest with all 3 guys getting in all their patented moves.  There was one sick move where Batista set Bryan up for a powerbomb and he was lowering him for the boom, Orton flies in and catches Bryan with his RKO sending Bryan through the announce table.  Great match and a very satisifying ending about 8 months in the making.  We finally get the payoff we were looking for.

All in all, the event was one of the better WM's that I have seen in recent years with just about every match being better than what I thought it was going to be.  It was sad that Taker's streak had to come to an end, but you have to remember, Taker once did an interview where he stated he didn't want to be undefeated at WM.  That he didn't want his career to be based solely on that.  In fact, at one time, he wanted Kane to be the one to end it.  I do wish someone younger or someone more devoted to the business could have taken the streak but I'm not as disappointed in it as some people are on the internet.  I'm surprised that Brock hasn't gotten death threats yet!!  The business with Warrior is truly a sad thing to find out simply because of leaving behind his wife and two young daughters.  I never like it when kids are involved cause it just makes it even more worse.  Warrior should always live on in our hearts and minds.  Thank you for the matches you gave us Warrior and may you rest in peace finally.

This was a terrific event and one that I would actually give a 10 out of 10 to!  I can't wait till it is released and I can watch it again!",1397174400,19,7626,4.067069081153588
6201360,5,B00HRUQARI,"30 years in the making. 30 years of blood, sweat and sweatso... I mean tears.
In the build to this Wrestlemania, WWE made pretty much every dumb mistake they possibly could have done. They buried the awesome feud between Daniel Bryan and the ""Authority"" after Summerslam, they brought back a completely out of shape Batista, fed him to the rabid WWE crowd in one of the most moronically booked Rumble in history, hotshot the Wyatts Vs. Shield match and gave CM Punk the straw that broke the camel's back. In other words, this anniversary Wrestlemania was a disaster in the making. It was especially worrisome because anniversary Manias always had a way of being amazingly average (10 being the exception).
After the WWE crowd unleashed a s***storm after the Rumble, the bookers and the authority hastily scrapped plans for Wrestlemania and tried to save what was possible to save.
In a shorthand decision, they booked Daniel Bryan into the show as the main character. And by god, I don't want to imagine what would have happened, had they pulled through with the original plans.

In the opening segment, Hulk Hogan came out, and started the night as the host, before Steve Austin and The Rock came out to thunderous applause to kick-start the show. They throw around some catchphrases and leave. This segment took 20 minutes (!), and honestly, it was boring. Just some mutual ego stroking.

The night really started with the match between Triple H and Daniel Bryan for the last place in the WWE Title match. The crowd was intense. Triple H had an awesome entrance, being announced by Stephanie, who played the role of the evil ""manager"" to perfection during the match. Both men wrestled for well over 25 minutes, and Bryan pulled HHH to maybe his best Wrestlemania match ever, probably only equaled or surpassed by his bout with Undertaker at WM 26. Bryan sold the shoulder injury well, and after Hunter's defeat, was taken out with a chair, to add spice to the main event.

Next, the Shield was allowed to squash the New Age Outlaws and Kane in a short, but intense match. I still pity that WWE did not build the Wyatts vs Shield feud up for Wrestlemania, since their encounter at Elimination Chamber was excellent. Not much to say here. It should be noted that Shield made a strong face turn the next night on RAW.

I was surprised that the Andre The Giant memorial battle royal made it to the main card instead of the Tag Team Championship match, with only two titles, one of them the Divas' Title, on the line in the main show. A match like this is always hard to follow, and the crowd was not really into it. The finish was very strong though, with Cesaro bodyslaming Big Show over the top rope. The crowd erupted. Great finish, and very well deserved for Cesaro.

The build up of Cena vs. Bray Wyatt had interesting psychology, thanks to Wyatt, who is a promo genius in my book. Easily the most original and interesting character WWE had in years. What a shame that he had to succumb to Cena's ego. The psychology in this match, and the storytelling is something to behold. It was a noticeable trend in this Mania that the young newcomers like Bryan and Wyatt carried their established counterparts, and brought them to a match quality they didn't have for a very long time. There was a point where a heel turn of Cena was again possible, but like I said, in the end, Wyatt had to lose to Super-Cena.

Now, Undertaker Vs. Brock Lesnar was a match that many, myself included, considered poorly built. Even Lesnar was reportedly not happy with it because he was not portrayed as a legitimate threat to the Taker. In retrospect, ending the Undertaker's streak was an even dumber decision than it appeared live. The match itself was underwhelming, not only because it was clearly intentionally stretched in order to have a 20+ minutes match time and therefore slow, but also because Taker suffered a concussion early on, and had to rely on Lesnar. In the end, the ""Beast Incarnate"" put Taker down with the F-5 for the victory, as the entire audience froze in a state of utter shock (the camera shots capturing it are priceless).
I really wish WWE had taken more time to hype the Taker's streak-breaking match. As it is, factors unplanned as well as incompetent ones lead to this being dissapointing on many levels.
The commentators gave a long standing ovation for the Undertaker as he  collected himself and walked to the back.
Undertaker collapsed shortly after the match backstage, and was hospitalized. He reportedly couldn't remember pretty much anything from the match.

As a tranquillizer for the audience, WWE put on the Vickie Guerrero 14 Divas Invitational for AJ's Divas' Championship. The crowd obviously wasn't pleased with the Taker-Lesnar match, and completely ignored this encounter. Nobody needs to see these diva disasters anyway. I'm not sure how, but AJ retained with the Black Widow. Personally, I find AJ super-cute and the most deserving of the title, simply because of her great charisma, but really, this diva division is utterly pointless.

Now on to the main event.
I mean this as honestly and as strongly as I can with words: Daniel Bryan saved the match. He did an awesome job playing the babyface in peril, against all odds, and performed like a champ. In the middle of the match, Triple H and Stephanie came out with their personal referee to screw Bryan again, but he took out the ref as well as Stephanie. Hunter pulled out his beloved sledgehammer, which Bryan countered and used on HHH instead to knock him out. Orton and Batista teamed up and gave Bryan a combined RKO-Batista Bomb on the French announce table. Bryan was to be carried out on a stretcher, but returned, and in the end made Batista tap out to the Crossface. The celebration afterwards took the roof off the Superdome. I have seldomly heard a crowd escalate to this extend. Let's hope for an awesome summer of Bryan.

Taking everything into account, this Wrestlemania was the strongest in years and years, and better than anyone had the right to expect. They focused purely on wrestling, reduced the number of matches, and instead gave the participants time to work. They also nixed the annual concert performances, except for few performances of entrance themes. The Taker match was dissapointing, admittedly, but still, and if only for the result, a legendary event.
But the success of this PPV has a name, and one name only: Daniel Bryan. He singlehandedly saved the show. I tip my hat to the flying goat.",1397174400,4,6511,4.738746690203001
6201361,1,B00HRUQARI,"I thought last years was bad, but this one takes the prize. daniel bryan won title, (i wonder why), (sarcastic) he only won because hes over with the crowd (hence another John Cena). AJ retained the diva's title only to lose it on raw the next night, no point in that if you ask me. John Cena beat Bray Wyatt, can't say I'm surprised by that either the match was executed well and Cena should have put him over but didn't. But Lensar beating Taker was a joke, first the whole match was nothing like any of Taker's from years past, The referee clearly wasn't that bright. it didn't even look like he counted to 3 before he called for the bell. Undertaker deserves better. That streak was a selling point for Mania', but they will realize that when they lose money next year. And now we listen to Paul Heyman's mouth (more than usual.) If u wanna watch a better WM check out X-7, or 28, or WM III. This one however is garbage, It was suppose to be one of the best Wrestlemania's ever,(considering one of the main matches was suppose to be Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Cm Punk but that didn't happen) but ended up being the worst . and unlike most people I didn't say it was good just because it was the 30th anniversary, (although it should have been a stacked card considering it was the 30th.) the only thing that is worth watching is the Hall Of Fame ceremony (thats always good though). RIP Ultimate Warrior!!!! you will be missed!",1397001600,6,1432,4.367041198501872
6201362,5,B00HRUQARI,"In my opinion, this was the best Wrestlemania in history. Not just because I was there, but because this was filled with so many memorable moments that you have got to see to believe.

The preshow kicked off with the Usos defending their tag team championships against The Real Americans, Ryback and Curtis Axel and Los Matadoras. This was a high pace fatal four way that turned into an elimination match. What a great match to kick off Wrestlemania. It was back and forth throughout the entire match and the Usos ended up winning to retain their tag team championships. At the end of the match Cesaro turns on Swagger and gave him the Cesaro swing. Cesaro turned face as Wrestlemania began.

To kick off Wrestlemania 30, the host (Hulk Hogan) came down to the ring and gave one of his memorable promos I have heard from him in a long time. Ever tho, he messed up a bit calling the Superdome, the silverdome, he still gave a great promo. Hulk Hogan was soon interrupted by Stone Cold Steve Austin and the crown erupted. Everyone thought Hulk Hogan was about to get the stunner, but instead Austin thanked Hogan and welcomed him back to the Wwe as well as congratulating him on being the host of Wrestlemania. Soon after, The Rock came out and the crowd became electrified as The Rock joined Stone Cold and Hogan. All three were great together and all three gave amazing promos to kick off the start of Wrestlemania 30. Afterward, they all shared a cold one and saluted the wwe universe as they exited the arena.

Match 1: Daniel Bryan vs. Triple H
First off, the entrance to Triple H was epic and a must see. The match was great with a lot of action from start to finish. Triple H would target Daniel Bryan's already injured shoulder, but the YES movement assisted Bryan to overcome the pain and pull off the victory. Stephanie McMahon entered the ring and began slapping and distracting Bryan allowing an irate Triple H to blindside Bryan and again targeted Bryan's arm. Triple H wrapped a steel chair around Bryan's injured arm, which was placed next to the steel post. Stephanie then began taunting and mocking Bryan as well as the WWE universe.

Match 2: The Shield Vs. Corporate Kane and The New Age Outlaws

The Shield dominated the match and destroyed Kane and the New Age outlaws making quick work of them. Rollings connected with a double spear and The Shield hit a two person powerbomb on The New Age Outlaws to end the match.

Match 3: 30 man Andre the Giant Battle Royal

The match was amazing. Everyone through the favorite was the Big Show as he was clearly the biggest one in the match, but a surprise 31 entrant Cesaro picked up The Big Show for approximately 5 seconds and tossed him out of the ring, much like, Hogan did to Andre the Giant. That was a shock to everyone and was very impressive. Cesaro was the winner of the andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal.

Match 4: John Cena vs Bray Wyatt

Bray Wyatt's entrance was awesome with a live band playing his entrance theme. The match was mostly dominated by Bray Wyatt, but eventually John Cena faced his fear head on and defeated Bray Wyatt and kept his Legacy going.

Match 5: The Undertaker vs. Brock Lesner

The match was the most shocking EVER. The match started out evenly matched, but Brock Lesner was too strong and eventually overpowered the Undertaker. The undertaker couldn't regain his strength and ultimately laid to rest after taking 3 F5's and the streak ended at 21-1. The crowd and the entire WWE Universe were in shocked when the Undertaker was defeated for the first time at Wrestlemania. I would like to thank the Undertaker for all the memories he has given over the years.

Match 6: Aj Lee vs the Divas
After the Undertaker losing, the fans were still in shocked and coukd not get into the Divas match even tho it was a great match. I felt sorry for the Divas, cuz they never really got a chance. Aj Lee ended up winning the match after using the black widow.

Match 7: Daniel Bryan vs. Batista vs. Randy Orton

This match was great. High pace match and full of action. Triple H and Stephanie Mcmahon attempted to screw Bryan out of the championship again, but got a sledgehammer to the head by Bryan and eventually submitted Batista in the yes-lock. The crowd became rocking as their underdog hero finally did it and won the Championship.

I gave this a 5 star rating, because all matches were great. Not a bad match on the card. Plus several surprises and much much more. I would recommend this to everyone. Get your copy today!!!",1397001600,2,4525,4.541769041769042
6201363,4,B00HRUQARI,"Normally I wait until the end to give my summary but based off how people usually judge WrestleMania (and in this case, just one particular match alone), I'll just give it now. This edition of WrestleMania topped last years edition in that as the commercials & special plugs for certain things was heavily reduced in comparison to the previous year, the spotlight & focus was on the wrestlers from past & present when celebrating the 30th edition of Mania eliminating things making the celebrity involvement being heavily reduced to only the musical artist performing their wrestler's themes, and a high majority of the matches getting an amount of time to play out the SPORTS aspect of the ""sports entertainment"" event of the year. I personally would have moved things around for certain talents & matches to be in different positions along with the result of a few matches but I can't change that & won't let that cloud my judgment of the overall show in what was a quality Mania.

It should be noted that we didn't get a performance of ""America The Beautiful"" this year but had the show start off with a WrestleMania moment itself in Hulk Hogan & Steve Austin & The Rock together in the ring at the ""Silverdome"" to kick off the show while we had special appearances throughout the night from various legends of WrestleMania past including Danny Davis, Sgt. Slaughter, Jim Duggan, Ricky Steamboat, Ted Dibiase Sr., Pat Patterson, Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff and members of the newest Hall Of Fame members Lita, Jake Roberts, Carlos Colon, Razor Ramon/Scott Hall, Mr. T, and Ultimate Warrior in what is now has gone down as one of his final appearances.

Daniel Bryan vs. Triple H - The winner of this match would advance to the triple threat main event for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship while it should be noted that Stephanie McMahon not only introduced Triple H but also was in his corner for the match. Bryan came into this match with his shoulder heavily taped from the attack weeks earlier which Triple H targeted right away while Bryan was able to repeatably ground Triple H with takedowns along with offense such as the running DDT off the apron & top rope somersault that not only hurt Triple H but himself as well allowing Triple H to continue to work over the arm using the environment on the outside along with various strikes & submissions as both men continued to trade momentum either using the same strategy such as suplexes or finding counters & reversals to other signature trademark offense. While it's unusual to see Triple H in an opening match position, it lead to one of the best opening matches in WrestleMania history as both men played off each other very well.

The Shield vs. Kane & New Age Outlaws - This match was pretty short & sweet with The Shield being completely dominate from start to finish with including taking out either one or two members of The Authority at a same including delivering a triple powerbomb we haven't seen before.

Andre The Giant Memorial Over The Top Rope Battle Royal - The participants for this match include Yoshi Tatsu, Brad Maddox, Brodus Clay, Great Khali, Zack Ryder, Darren Young, 3MB (Drew McIntyre, Heath Slater, Jinder Mahal), Mark Henry, The Miz, Santino Marella, Xavier Woods, Damien Sandow, Justin Gabriel, David Otunga, Big E, Fandango, R-Truth, Sin Cara, Tyson Kidd, Goldust, Cody Rhodes, Rey Mysterio, Kofi Kingston, Dolph Ziggler, Alberto Del Rio, Sheamus, Cesaro & Big Show. Various highlights include Mark Henry & 3MB, Santino's Cobra, Fandangoing, Kofi living up to his Royal Rumble reputation of somehow avoiding an elimination, and when it came down to the final two & the feat of strength that happened with the final elimination. This was your typical battle royal but definitely a WrestleMania moment & star making moment for the winner.

John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt - Mark Crozer performed the Wyatt's theme ""Live In Fear"" as Bray began the mind games right away almost sacrificing himself for Cena to ""FINISH ME!"" allowing Bray to dominate Cena who wasn't fighting back until Cena finally got aggressive & trying to fight his anger to the point where he was close to getting disqualified on more than one occasion with Bray laughing at the beating he was receiving while playing other mind games including his counter to the five knuckle shuffle that we've never seen before & froze Cena dead in his tracks as they traded momentum with Bray being able to catch & counter Cena's trademark offense while delivering some of his own such as a DDT on the apron along continuing to taunt Cena like when he decided to bring a chair into the ring while Cena continued to fight not only Bray & the rest of the Wyatt's on the outside who made their presence known but also himself & the temptation to turn go against what he represents. I'll say that this was Cena's best match I can remember as far as telling a story which in this case is similar to Luke Skywalker & The Emperor in ""Return Of The Jedi"" where he keeps tempting him to cross over to ""the dark side.""

Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar - ""The Streak vs. The Beast"" was the subtitle here as Taker went against the one man he's never beaten dating back to over a decade earlier as Taker came out with strikes while Brock deliver more physical offense such as a belly to belly suplex & over the top clothesline resulting in Taker getting more physical using the ringside environment to weaken Brock's arm as both men were able to counter each other attempt at a big move before Brock focused in keeping Taker grounded with various strikes while Taker went for more impactful moves such as a legdrop or chokeslam as they went back & forth countering & reversing each other's attempts at submissions & trademark finishers. This match definitely let to what has to be the most shocking moment in WrestleMania history which has definitely had mixed reactions all over social media amongst others public forums (another subject for another time) but as for the match itself regardless if you agree with what happened, it was very similar to the Brock/HHH match at SummerSlam where it didn't live up to the standards that both men have been known to deliver on a big stage or even match quality of matches they had a decade earlier but what has been revealed now days after this match is that Undertaker suffered a severe concussion at the beginning of the match but kept going to the point where he did collapse shortly after he got backstage & went to the hospital with Vince McMahon himself, who didn't stay to watch the main event of his biggest show of the year for the first time ever, showing how serious the injury was. So knowing now what I didn't know when watching the match, I would have to compare this match to Cena/Rock from last year & grade this match on a curve due to the injury suffered & give Taker credit for putting on a physical performance knowing how serious the injury was.

Vickie Guerrero's Divas Championship Invitational Match - The participants in this match include Champion A.J. Lee, Aksana, Alicia Fox, Bella Twins (Nikki & Bree), Funkadactyles (Cameron & Naomi), Emma, Eva Marie, Layla, Natalya, Rosa Mendes, Summer Rae & Tamina Snuka. This was a one fall to a finish match all the divas in the same ring at the same time leading to such highlights as the who were the odd women out at teh start, one diva coming close to a wardrobe malfunction, each diva hitting one big move after another, and the interaction between the Bellas. It was as good as expected from a multi-diva match.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista vs. Daniel Bryan - Rev Theory performed ""Voices"" as Orton came to the ring as both Batista & Orton took advantage of the ""No Disqualification"" stipulation on the outside using the barriers & ringside steps as weapons while Bryan was able to work over both men in the ring with each man as the interaction between all three lead to such moments as the third man breaking up pins between the other two or stealing a attempt pin off the other man, one man hitting a big move only for the third man to come with another big move right after, and an unlikely alliance (or reunion) formed when two men decided together to take out the biggest threat in the match including one double team move that ended up hitting the receiver as much as the executor, and more than just other two competitors not wanting to see Daniel Bryan as WWE Champion. This was a great triple threat match that played to everyone's strengths while also giving one hell of a WrestleMania moment to end the show.

(PreShow Match) Elimination Match: Tag Team Champions Usos vs. Los Matadores vs. Real Americans vs. RybAxel - You got exactly what was expected seeing not just how many but all the names involved here with such moments as each team making blind tags & attempting to steal pins with one team being smart enough to use the strategy of not being tagged in to avoid elimination, various double team combinations including one of the ""managers"" also getting involved in the action, each team showcasing a different strategy during the match, and show impressive showcases of power from Cesaro & Ryback. This was a great match that was given more time than usual (close to 20 minutes) to play out well with the bigger story behind what happened afterwords that would play into what would happen later that night.

Also included with this event is the entire WWE Hall Of Fame ceremony with various highlights such as the emotional speech from Jake Roberts & induction by Diamond Dallas Page, Trish Stratus inducting not only her greatest partner & rival but also the godmother of her newly born baby in Lita, Gene Okerland inducting Mr. T who made it clear who he heavily felt like he had to thank, Carlos Colon inducted by his sons & nephew Primo & Epico & Carlito with Carlito giving the best one-liner of the night, Razor Ramon's induction along with a public reunion that long time fans have been waiting to see, and Linda McMahon induction Ultimate Warrior who gave what was possibly the most anticipated induction speech of all time.

Overall I heavily enjoyed this WrestleMania while the edition of the Hall Of Fame will go down as one of my favorites so I recommend this.",1396915200,18,10245,4.689271817676487
6201364,5,B00HRUQARI,"I thought this was a pretty good Wrestlemania. The event left me happy and sad. It was very sad to see The Undertaker lose and perhaps wrestle his last match in WWE. His match with Lesnar was pretty good it was not as epic as his Wrestlemania matches with Shawn Michaels, Cm Punk, Ric Flair or Triple H but it makes this dvd worth the price to see perhaps what is The Undertaker's last match in WWE. This loss makes it the most shocking moment in Wrestlemania history and also one of the most shocking moments in the history of wrestling.

  I know a lot of wrestling fans didn't like it and thought the streak should never been broken. I tend to agree but if it's what the Undertaker wanted I can respect that. He gave the WWE and the WWE fans everything he had for the past twenty plus years. I think he has the right to go out the way he wants to. It was interesting he picked Lesnar to beat him who is essentially a part timer and ironically enough someone the Undertaker didn't always get along with. My take on it is Lesnar beating Taker benefits the WWE in the long run because even though Lesnar is part time he will put over the younger wrestlers like Daniel Bryan in the future which will make the new guys look stronger. I think Lesnar will stay in wrestling for years to come on a part time schedule. Lesnar's heart may never be truly in the wrestling business but in the end he will do business and help the WWE.

  I was happy to see wrestling fans finally get what they want. Daniel Bryan is the guy in WWE and it proves WWE Universe has a voice and eventually the WWE has to listen to it's consumer and fans. We got two great matches with Bryan vs HHH and Bryan vs Batista vs Orton. I think this was a great moment for WWE to have Bryan grab the brass ring. They were two of my favorite matches on the card.

  John Cena vs Bray Wyatt was another solid match. John Cena won. I thought that was fine. Cena is the fan favorite. It would have helped Wyatt to pick up a upset over Cena at mania but Cena won. There was a great segment with Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold and The Rock. It makes you wonder if The Rock will comeback next year and face Lesnar. I think that will happen. Stone Cold wrestling another match is a stretch but it would be pretty cool to see CM Punk vs Stone Cold as the Dream Match. I think it's up to Stone Cold. It's nice to see Hogan back he belongs in WWE. His wrestling in the ring days are over but he can still contribute in other ways.

  The only surprise for me was not seeing Sting appear. I think it would have been something to see him come out at a Wrestlemania even if just for a moment. The face of WCW in WWE for the first time. I think depending on The Undertaker's health and how he feels I think it's a strong possibility we see Sting vs Taker at Wrestlemania 31. The streak having ended will take nothing away from the match as it's just a treat for wrestling fans and two wrestlers that have wanted to face each other for a long time.

  All in all it was a very exciting and shocking Wrestlemania that will be talked about for a long time. Things look good for the WWE moving forward with Bryan as Champ. I can't wait for next year's Wrestlemania! Cheers and Enjoy!",1396915200,2,3218,4.15112540192926
6201365,5,B00HRUQARI,"The Daniel Bryan-Triple H match was a well-paced,hard-working bout. The Shield-Kane & New Age Outlaws 6 man tag team match was short but sweet. The Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal was solid and good by battle royal standards with a awesome finish to boot. The John Cena-Bray Wyatt match was not great but had pretty good storytelling even with the sloppy finish. The Undertaker-Brock Lesnar match was also not great but pretty good. The Vickie Guerrero Divas Invitational title match was solid for that type of match. The Randy Orton-Batista-Daniel Bryan-3 way-WWE title match was a heart-pounding,smash-mouth,hardcore brawl.

6201366,2,B00HRUQARI,"Oh boy......oh boy. Every year I look forward to the super bowl and wrestlemania, the super bowl sucked so all I had left was Wrestlemania 30 but unlike the Super bowl, Wrestlemania can decide it's fate. Let's review Wrestlemania 30

First of all Hulk Hogan, it's the super dome and the 30 minute promo with him, The Rock and Stone Cold was a waste...sorry but it could've been a match that got us pumped but instead we saw everyone kiss up to each other. LAME. The crowd wasn't that good either, that or they were just not interested, can't blame them if they were because this show was garbage (minus the main event).

First match: Daniel Bryan vs Triple H (winner fights at the main event )
Great opener, but the drama was not in it, I believe they have more matches in the work but I thought they would've done more to stop Bryan. Not a wild ending but it looked good, expected more from the only good build up on the whole show.

Second match: The shield vs Kane, New age outlaws
waste of build up and talent. Squash match, and a stale faction. Should've split up the Shield but instead we got a squash match that wasn't worth anyone's time

Third Match : 30 man battle royal
Christian wasn't in it which bummed me out. Pretty good battle royal, too much jobbers, thought they would've brought some old timers back for that nostalgic feeling but Jobbers were on the battle royal instead. Good ending, I am satisfied with the winner. Thank the lord Shemus did not win.

fourth match: Bray Wyatt vs John Cena
UGGGGGH I don't even know what to say? This match wasn't bad, it had some good spots but I wanted more, I do not want to see the same thing I saw on monday for the past 8 years. The match shouldn't of been 20 minutes either, no need for that. If you missed the match, you didn't miss anything great

5th match : The Undertaker vs Brock Lesner
21 years.......21 matches......my childhood all came together for a snooze fest. This match sucked. Sorry Brock, Sorry Mark but the streak should've ended after Triple H was defeated at WM 28, it was a great way to end it but instead this is what we got ? The crowd didn't care until the end by the way, 3 F-5s doesn't make a great match. A shocking ending doesn't make a great ending either. This match has been erased from my memory because garbage gets thrown away. Undertaker is 21 and 0 and he retired. Brock vs taker never happened.

sixth match: Divas match
At least you're only spending 10 dollars a month for this channel

seventh match : Daniel Bryan vs Batista vs Randy Orton for the the big one
Match of the night, perfect way to end a night. Great to see Bryan finally get the big one. Loved the table spot, loved the interference , loved the close counts. Everyone did great in this match. Worth the 10 dollars

Overall though, this show is boring, a snooze fest and I wanted it to get to the main event and call it a night because everything else was garbage.....garbage build up, garbage crowd, garbage....GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE I'VE HAD IT WITH GARBAGE . Unless you love Brock Lesner and Daniel Bryan and wrestlemania...don't buy this show unless you need help to sleep",1396828800,7,3142,4.422145328719723
6201367,5,B00HRUQARI,"WWE celebrated the 30th Wrestlemania in the city that knows how to celebrate; New Orleans and I must say that whether you were there live or watched it at home, this was a really great Wrestlemania!

The show opened with a golden segment between three of the best of all time: Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock. Hogan botched a couple of words and accidentally referred to the Superdome as the Silverdome, which the 3 turned into a joke. Overall a great and entertaining 10 minute segment from these 3 to get the audience hyped for the night

1.) Triple H w/Stephanie McMahon Helmsley vs Daniel Bryan

With the stipulation being that the winner of the match got added to the Triple Threat World Title match later that night, Triple H and Bryan had much more of a reason to tear into each other, making this opener much more enjoyable. Triple H worked over Bryan's arm throughout most of the match but Bryan managed to come through with the high knee to win the match. Bryan's post-match victory is cut short when he's slapped by Stephanie and assaulted by Triple H with a chair

_______________________________________________________________

2.) The Shield vs The New Age Outlaws and Kane

If you went to the bathroom, by the time you came back, this match would be over as it lasted not even 5 minutes. This was a total squash match that saw The Shield dominate Kane and The Outlaws beginning to end with NAO and Kane getting no offense in. The Shield win with a double powerbomb on the Outlaws. Kind of sad to see 3 legends like the Outlaws and Kane job at the biggest PPV of the year but I know it was all to make The Shield look strong

_______________________________________________________________

3.) Andre the Giant Battle Royal

This match was set up by Hogan with the winner receiving an Andre the Giant trophy that was nicely placed at ringside. This match was mostly made up of a lot of jobbers and a few solid mid-carders. The final 2 came down to Cesaro and Big Show and I was solidly behind Cesaro. Cesaro picks up the win, when he does his own Hogan/Andre Wrestlemania III moment by bodyslamming Show out of the win. Nice match and glad to see WWE gave Cesaro the win. That's a great sign that his time to shine is not very far from the future

_______________________________________________________________

4.) John Cena vs Bray Wyatt

This feud kind of reminded me of the Hulk Hogan/Undertaker feud from 1991. Undertaker, a supernatural force trying to destroy the legacy of kids' hero, Hulk Hogan. Skip to 2014 where we have Bray Wyatt, a supernatural force trying to destroy the legacy of kids' hero, John Cena. This match told a story between the 2 and was very psychological and solid. I was disappointed to see Super Cena once again overcome the odds and beat Bray. If they wanted Cena to win, I think they should've given him a DQ victory rather than letting him pin Bray. Regardless, I look forward to seeing how the remainder of the feud pans out

_______________________________________________________________

5.) Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman vs The Undertaker

This match was an absolute shocker. Probably the biggest shocker in Wrestlemania history as Brock Lesnar conquered the legendary and prestigious Streak of The Undertaker. I don't think many people expected Lesnar to win but we were all surprised. The Undertaker had been undefeated since 1991's Wrestlemania 7 and Brock became the first person to beat Undertaker at Mania. The match itself was okay but was pretty slow for the most part. I just still can't wrap my mind around the fact that it's over.  21-1. I always expected someone like Shawn Michaels or Chris Jericho or Kane to be the one that broke the Streak. This will without a doubt, forever be the biggest shocker in Wrestlemania history.

_______________________________________________________________

6.) Vickie Guerrero Invitational Diva's Championship Match

More history was made at Wrestlemania XXX as this was the first time ever that the Diva's Championship was being defended at Wrestlemania and AJ was the diva defending it. I thought this would be like a Gauntlet match or similar to the Cruiserweight Invitational that happened at Wrestlemania 20 but instead it was a one fall match with all the divas on the roster in the ring at once. Considering AJ had less than a 10% chance of winning, I expected the title to change hands. After making Naomi tap to the Black Widow, AJ Lee once again escaped from all the other divas with her championship. There. She's now beaten every diva on the roster. Now can we get Paige up on the roster, please?

_______________________________________________________________

7.) Triple Threat WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match: Randy Orton (c) vs Batista vs Daniel Bryan

The final match of the night saw Orton defend his title against 2014 Royal Rumble winner and #1 Contender Daniel Bryan. This match goes back and forth and gets really intense at times. I loved the spot where Batista and Orton did a Batista Bomb/RKO combo on Bryan through the Spanish Announce Table. Right as Bryan looked to have the match won, Triple H interfered, took out Bryan and the referee and replaced him with Scott Armstrong (the Modern Era's version of a 1997 Survivor Series Earl Hebner). Bryan managed to overcome and take out Triple H with his sledgehammer and trap Batista in the YES Lock, forcing Batista to tap out and making Bryan once again the World Champion. It was well deserved and hopefully he'll get a legitimate run with the titles this time and no funny stuff with him getting stripped of them again. Bryan's sister and niece get in the ring at the end and celebrate his victory. A great moment to close a great PPV.

Overall: A great Wrestlemania no doubt! Way better than the borefest that we got last year with Wrestlemania 29. The build-up for the matches was great and the matches themselves delivered. I hope that Wrestlemania 31 is equally as great or better next year and I can't wait to pick this up on DVD when it hits stores!",1396828800,2,6062,4.8301158301158305

1. Daniel Bryan vs. Triple H: We great an amazing opener and probably the match of the night right here.  Daniel Bryan and HHH fought a great technical battle here.  Many moves and counters, very physical, and I felt this match had the perfect time length at about 25 minutes.  Daniel Bryan gets the win with a running high knee to set up the main event.  Triple H attacks Bryan afterwards.  Amazing match.
10/10

2. The Shield vs. Corporate Kane & The New Age Outlaws:  A very short match here, but honestly it was a whole lot of fun.  The Shield DOMINATED Corporate Kane and the New Age Outlaws.  A lot of nice spots for a match that only lasted 3 minutes.  Stil a very fun 3 minutes though.  Shield gets the win after what I call a double-triple powerbomb onto the Outlaws.

3. Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal:  Advertised as 30-Man Battle Royal, it's actually a 31-man Battle Royal.  A lot of good spots here, however I felt it was too short.  It was exciting, but I just think it could've been longer.  Kofi Kingston again amazingly escapes elimination towards the end, this time with help from the steel steps.  Cesaro earns a very well-deserved victory here after basically bodyslamming the Big Show over the top rope.  Great match though kind of short
8/10

4. Bray Wyatt vs. John Cena:  This is the match I was looking forward to all night.  Kind of slow at times but I think they told a very good story here.  The parts where the action picked up we're really entertaining, and there were also some pretty decent spots.  Watch out for when Wyatt does is creep spider walk while Cena tries the 5 knuckle shuffle.  I felt Bray Wyatt should've gotten the win here but I'm not unhappy with the finish. I think this match would've benefited if it were No Holds Barred or something.  I hope they have a more violent encounter at Extreme Rules if they continue the feud.  Cena wins with the AA.  Entertaining match-up
8/10

5. Brock Lesnar vs Undertaker:  Wow.  That's all I have to say.  Not about the match, as I felt the quality of the match was extremely disappointing.  I didn't feel the match was very exciting, and I may get a lot of crap for it, but I don't give a damn.  The blow of Undertakers streak coming to an end at the hands of a part timer would've been easier to deal with had the match been better.  It had it's moments and is re-watchable, I guess I just set my expectations way too high,  Lesnar gets the win after an F-5.  RIP to the Streak
5/10

6. Diva's Invitational:  Not too bad.  A lot of spots here.  Another match I figured could've gone on a little longer.  But still,  prett good match here.  The crowd wasn't too into it after the Streak ended, and honestly I wasn't either til I watched it a 2nd time.  Definitely not a waste of time.
6/10

7. Triple Threat match: Randy Orton(c) vs. Batista vs. Daniel Bryan: Great way to end the show.  Really exciting Triple Threat match.  I honestly thought it wouldve been awesome if Triple H wouldve been added to make it a Fatal-4-Way.  Instead he runs interference during the middle of the match which kind of slows the pace down.  But then it speeds up after Bryan gets up off the stretcher.  Each men trade finishing moves with each-other, plenty of near falls, and Bryan locks both opponents in the Yes Lock several times, but his application of it on Batista is what earns him the tap-out and the WWE World Heavyweight title. Phenomenal match.

Each talked for like 10 minutes there, then Hogan and Mr. T almost get into a repeat fight with Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff while having Mean Jean Okurland in the middle. Never saw Hogan again. Surprisingly there was no National Anthem Opening either!

+ Most of the matches turned out to be great however:

1. Daniel Bryan VS Triple H (with Stephanie McMahon)
- Singles match for the third spot in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship Triple Threat match.
* Winner: Daniel Bryan [9/10]
* Had some slow moments, but still a good paced fight with lots of counters. You get to see Triple H actually try out some submission holds, which makes it for a while a submission contest. Lots of kick out also from all of their best moves too. HHH makes a mistake at the end, and then gets the running knee. I guess The Game is the real B+ superstar.

2. The Shield VS Coorperate Kane and The New Age Outlaws
- Six-Man Tag Match
* Winner: The Shield [2/10]
* Simply too short for a review. Only gets a 2 because of what The Shield did to Kane, Road Dogg, and Billy Gunn.

3. 31-Man Battle Royal for the Andr the Giant Memorial Trophy
- Winner: Cesaro [4/10]
* ""How did Kofi do that!?"" happened again! Had some funny moments which gives it a 4.

4. John Cena VS Bray Wyatt (with Luke Harper and Erick Rowan)
- Singles Match
* Winner: John Cena [10/10]
* Just as expected, weird from the beginning. It starts off by Wyatt going on his knees and offers himself to Cena. He only waited until Bray got up then this turns into an epic brawl all the way! They kick out and break out of each other's best moves, then when Bray gets stunned, Cena takes out the rest of The Wyatt Family. One gets struck with a chair and the other gets speared through the barricade. When Bray gets up the battle continues until he gets hit with an A.A. for the win.

5. The Streak VS The Beast
- Singles Match for The Undertaker's Streak.
* Winner: Brock Lesnar [8/10]
* A pretty slow fight where Lesnar seemed to have more control since Taker was on the ground most the fight. Lesnar kicks out of one crazy Chokeslam, later a Last Ride, and at the end a Tombstone which all didn't work. Lesnar did two F-5's on Taker, but he kicked out of both. Then it went into a submission war: Undertaker did multiple Hell's Gates where Lesnar got out from turning it into a powerbomb both times. Then he pulled Lesnar into repeated Kimura Locks, but Brock got the ropes all times. At the end it seemed like Taker had no energy left and got hit with a 3rd and final F-5 for a controversial pinfall since it did seem like Taker kicked out before the 3-count.

6. 14-Diva Single-Fall Match for the WWE Divas Championship
- Winner: AJ Lee [0/10]
* Just a combination of boring, ridiculous, and stupid.

7. Randy Orton (c), Batista, and Daniel Bryan
- Triple Threat match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship (No Countouts & No DQ Stipulations Added)
* Winner Daniel Bryan [9/10]
* Went just one down because at one point the match went very slow because Bryan and Orton both got injured at once. Bryan got a Batista Bomb into an RKO outside through an announce table, but Orton's back landed on a TV monitor badly. It turned in to the One-on-One they wanted for a bit, but Bryan got of the stretcher and walked back leaving them speechless. Triple H came back out to end Bryan once and for all with his infamous sledgehammer, but Daniel took it and hit HHH in the face with it. When Orton took a Batista Bomb, Bryan dropped Batista into a Yes-Lock making him tap!

Set up by Hogan. This match is good and I was betting on Big Show, but Ceasaro lift the 7'0 and 500 pound man over the ropes and won the match. Ceasaro got my respect and I hope that he will get a future WWE Heavyweight Championship shot.

Match 4: John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt.

Good match. Wyatt tried to win the match with the help from Harper and Rowan, but it was a nice try for Wyatt and Cena won the match with an AA.

Class of 2014 Hall of Fame inductees are introduced. This is the last time I saw one of my favorite legend wrestlers, Ultimate Warrior. R.I.P. Ultimate Warrior, you will be sadly missed by your loyal fans, but your legacy will live on forever.

Match 5: Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar.

Un-frigging-believable, Brock Lesnar slayed the streak and RIP streak. As a fan of wrestling for over 20 years, The Undertaker suffers his first loss at WrestleMania for the first time. Lesnar won with a clean pin with a huge F5. When I saw Undertaker suffers his first loss, I dropped my jaw and was shocked included the whole audience. Lesnar is too much for Undertaker, Lesnar is too strong, huge, and scary. Thank you, Undertaker, you tried your best. Someday you will be inducted to the Hall of Fame along with your Streak.

Match 6: Divas title match.

AJ Lee wins the match by submission.

Main Event Match for the WWE Heavyweight Championship: Daniel Bryan vs. Randy Orton vs. Batista.

My all time favorite. This match is intense. HHH and Scott Armstrong tried to screw Bryan out of this match, but it was a nice try. Bryan dived out of the ring and landed on Hunter, Armstrong, and Stephanie. This angered Hunter and he tried to hit Bryan with his trademark sledgehammer, but Bryan used the sledgehammer against him. Next Batista and Orton double teamed and they put Bryan through the Spanish announcer's table with a combination of the RKO and the Batista Bomb. Bryan won this match with the running knee on Batista and he forced him to tap out from the Yes Lock. After the match is over, the whole audience included myself are chanting Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, and there is explosions and confetti everywhere.

WrestleMania is AWESOME and intense, so I gave this PPV 5 stars. YES, YES, YES, YES, YES.",1396828800,4,3086,4.527927927927928
6201372,5,B00HRUQARI,"For putting on one hell of a show. This was the best Mania since, well, I can't even remember. I've been a fan since the Attitude Era kicked off and although I took some time off from the 'E some years ago, I came back to one of my childhood's entertainment. Top to bottom this show was incredibly fun. I haven't ""marked"" out like this in a long time. I rarely purchase big shows when they are released, but this one will enter my library.",1396742400,3,439,4.176470588235294
