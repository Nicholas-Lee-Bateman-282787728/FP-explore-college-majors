3660332,5,B001JXPC3M,"Midsomer Murders is a a very entertaining show. The characters are very well drawn, and though usually unbelievable, the stories are very interesting! It is unbelievable because if Midsomer had these many murders no one would ever live there or very few would be left! Nevertheless, the quirkiness of the characters and the likeableness of Barnaby and his sidekicks make this one of the best series around. I only wish A&E or Biography channel would pick them back up again, boo hoo to those of us in the U.S., but the DVD's are great!",1234224000,9,535,4.702127659574468
3660333,4,B001JXPC3M,"I have all the sets for Midsomer Murders. They are perfect except for one thing, there are no subtitles.  I tried to put my TV on subtitles hoping in vain it would pick up the words from the DVD but to no avail.  Subtitles would be nice as sometimes the accents can make the words hard to understand.  In addition, my parents are losing their hearing and subtitles are needed for them to fully understand what they are watching. Because of this, I have to give it 4 out of 5 stars.",1232409600,9,481,4.206521739130435

3660336,5,B001JXPC3M,I give all the Midsomer Murders Series five stars. I will even give one to Series 12 which I have on pre order. One of the best in a long line of British mysteries. If you like series I you will like all series though 12. Why cannot we in our country produce Mysteries like these. These are probably produced at half the budget of our American mysteries most of of which are blood and guts.,1231718400,19,390,4.144736842105263

3660372,5,B001JXPC3M,"My husband and I find ourselves enjoying English mystery series lately. We've just about finished this collection and look forward to settling into a mystery with detective Barnaby. It's nice to find a main character with a ""normal"", happy family life. The characters are a bit quirky. The plots are intricate and have a definite English twist to them, which makes it nice for something different from our American series (which we also enjoy). Very entertaining!
The only drawback is that every now and then we get a disk that sticks. I hate to miss any of the stories due to this. Still giving it 5 stars because we enjoy the series so much.",1411171200,,643,4.649122807017544

3660393,5,B001JXPC3M,I love John Nettles and the woman who plays his wife.  They remind me of my husband and myself.  And the little villages he services as an Instpector remind me of mine.  Just a cozy murder mystery in a beautiful setting.,1380931200,,220,4.317073170731708

3660410,5,B001JXPC3M,"I love Midsomer Murders. My favorites are the earlier ones with Gavin Troy as Barnaby's partner and these later ones with Ben Jones as his partner; not so  happy with middle shows with Scott as his partner.
I especially enjoy Four Funerals and a Wedding. Of course, all these episodes are worth to view more than once.  Overall, this is a great series and this is an excellent additon to the series. Of course, that is my opinion anyway. Enjoy crime shows? Enjoy british TV? Enjoy British tv mysteries? I think you'll enjoy this set without reservations.",1362182400,,554,4.701030927835052

Titles in this set 12 appear on season 9 part 2 here in New Zealand. Went back and checked your set 17 and found titles there are on season 8.  I am very weary of buying English series from Amazon as they do not correspond
with the series/season here.  Got caught out with the Frost series have all the series from 1 through to 12, found
15-16-17 appear on 10-11-12 here.  Pity thought I had discovered more Midsomer Murders and Frost.  Not Amazon's fault it is just the way things are packaged in other parts of the world.  Will still buy my DVD's from Amazon great service.",1308268800,,695,4.3828125

3660439,5,B001JXPC3M,Will continue to enjoy Midsomer Murders for as long as they continue to make it.  Do not look forward to the day that production ceases on the great series.,1260316800,,156,4.379310344827586

3660442,5,B001JXPC3M,"I am filled with admiration for the entire team responsible for the MM series. Great acting, wonderful plots, superb scenery.....all as is usual with this series! The only sad thing?  There is currently only one further series of these (Series 13) That is available!
Highly recommended, you do not need to have followed this series for years, Eeach mystery stands alone.",1253404800,,370,5.065573770491803
3660443,4,B001JXPC3M,"If you are already a fan of Midsomer Murders then be assured that Season 12 will not disappoint you.  For anyone looking for a delightful (if sometimes twisted) mystery of various murders which take place in the quaintest English villages and Countryside which make up Midsomer, then you have come to the right place.  I enjoy the locales, the quality character actors and of course John Nettles as Inspector Barnaby. However, one does wonder how much the population of Midsomer has dwindled over the years!  We feel cheated if there are less than 3 murders per episode!  Buy and enjoy.",1251158400,,586,4.83
3660444,5,B001JXPC3M,"Midsomer Murders are such fun, and I have certainly missed them since they have been taken off the BBC here in America.  Really looking forward to the new Set #13 coming out.

3660447,5,B001JXPC3M,"I love Midsomer Murders.  It's mystery, adventure and comic relief rolled into one.  I can't wait for Set 13 to come out because the U.S. channels have quit showing the series.  It's a shame because it was one of the best series on American TV.  Since it's available on DVD, I'll be able to see the episodes they did not show on television. I put Chief Inspector Barnaby right up there with Inspector Morse. British murder mysteries are great.",1244851200,,443,4.569620253164557

3660449,5,B001JXPC3M,"This is not only the best mystery series to come out of England.
It is the best to come out from anywhere in the world. If only the
U.S. could put out movies like this with excellent stories and
excellent actors. A friend in England tells me that the next
set 13 will be the last one Nettles will do. That is indeed sad to
know. My friend said that recently on British TV Nettles and his
TV wife toured the area where the series was made and it was
enchanting. I wish we could see it over here. I, for one will truly
miss these series.",1244160000,,535,4.009345794392523

3660454,5,B001JXPC3M,"""Last Year's Model"" is an episode of the Midsomer Murders series.  The story here, is arranged differently than the episodes I've seen so far.  This one begins when the suspect is sitting as the defendant in her trial as a murderer.  The backstory is presented within the testimony of course, but also in some well-organized-flashbacks.  It was refreshing, as far as I'm concerned it made it better.  Our hero's daughter Cully is involved in this case, not just included as some onscreen business to fill in the length of the script/story.  Note:  while I agree with most of the customer comments currently found here, about this set/episode record... my enjoyment of this episode, might be colored by the fact that my viewing sequence for the series is still random, and this is one of the newest episodes that I've seen.",1241913600,,822,4.828571428571428

In these few minutes inspector Barnaby and his wife Joyce were lowered to the level of the deviates that he encounters in his cases. Just one scene and the whole series is compromised. I think whoever was responsible should be fired,the series recalled and the last scean removed.and those of us who bought it given a replacement...J.Honings",1239321600,3,481,5.10126582278481

3660475,4,B001JXPC3M,"I received my long awaited set 12 two days ago. All four episode titles are clearly listed on the back cover (the cover is not blank on my set). The episodes were new to me (I have the first eleven sets and have viewed them multiple times). The US edition is different from the UK edition (US set twelve is actualy from season 11). So, I can see how there may be some confusion (I purchase DVD's from amazon.uk.com quite frequently and view them on my computer). I recommend set 12, though I must say the four episodes lacked the humour I came to rely on in ""MM"". Seems the programme is beginning to take itself too seriously...The relationship between Barnaby and his sidekick seems too blah, too much like real life... ;-) His other sidekicks were more fun to watch, which in turn took the edge off the high murder-to-episode ratio...
Yes, Barnaby is set to retire, with John Nettle's contract expiring in 2010. So, we are due for a few more Barnaby episodes. According to newspaper articles, the producers are hoping the show will go on, with a new (as yet unchosen) star. Pitty...I will miss Barnaby, Joyce and Kelly...(BTW: the actress playing Kelly has already retired; her last episode was the one centered around Kelly's wedding, which we have not seen yet in the US; maybe it will be included in set 13?).",1238284800,3,1314,4.572033898305085
3660476,5,B001JXPC3M,"For all of us who wondered how Cabot Cove wound up with any citizens left after all those murders in Jessica's wake...take heart...the territory has been expanded into a whole British equivalent of a county (Midsomer) in the heart of Jolly Olde England, chock full of villages just simmering over with perfect villiany.  This series is still going full steam in Britian.  In fact a rerun of one on ITV recently out performed all original programming on the other channels.  So it is just as appreciated in it's homeland as it is becoming in the colonies.  It is the epitome of well thought out murder plots brimming over with those gloriously quaint characters one only encounters in England.  Long time Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (played by John Nettles) and his now third Deputy Inspector are forever unraveling unsavory goings on in towns as diverse as Carsten (evidently the urban center of the county) or villages like Midsomer Mallow where the citizens busy themselves about the business of building up petty hatreds and retributions galore.  The pace is never too fast.  The murder or murders are always diabolique or so interpersonally convoluted as to render you entranced at it's revelation.  While lacking the bitter sophistication of Morse...or the witty repartee of Poirot in another era...these murder mysteries will bequile you with their scenery, their down to earth eccentrics, and even DCI Barnaby's happy home life (gone are the psychological demons attacking modern detectives and making them as miserable as the victims they encounter).  None of that in Midsomer.  You get the feeling Barnaby wouldn't trade his job for a promotion to London in a million years, he's content, but constantly amazed at the capacity for murder in his elysian fields.  He has a loving wife and a grown daughter who keeps moving in and out of his life.  The different villages are all interesting.  Nobody does this murder business better than the British...period.  It's just a lark on all counts.  At my house the wife, the kids, and the grandkids know that on Sunday evening it's my Midsomer Murder night and woe to those who disturb me during those 100 minutes of mayhem.",1238112000,38,2186,4.983471074380165
