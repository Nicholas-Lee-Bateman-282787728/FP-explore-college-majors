8642035,3,B00IGRO3RU,"Since the story sucked (it's a mix of a cabin movie and a Ouija movie) we should have gotten more nudity to offset it. Kati Sharp is hot, let's get that out of the way. How come almost every chick got naked but her? At least she's in her panties a lot. Besides that this movie is barely worth a rental.",1454371200,,302,3.9672131147540983
8642036,1,B00IGRO3RU,"What this movie was about? Beats me. I couldn't get past the first 20 minutes because of the horrible acting. Not one of these girls is a known actress, and never will be if this is how they preform in-front of a camera. I've seen enough of these things in the past to just go with your first gut instinct and just turn it off, don't bother wasting time hoping it gets better.

It's shot poorly, the acting is cringe worthy, it's full of typical done to death attempts at babes in the woods. A typical girl who has broken up, a supportive best friend, and the ugly borderline lesbian who has to be sarcastic and talk about ho much she hates men... combine that with superb efforts of worst actors of the year, and you have this movie about a couple of girls in a cabin that was built on the site of another cabin that burned down.... Gee, I wonder what I missed had I have watched the whole thing? Beats me!!!",1401321600,,909,4.224137931034483
8642037,3,B00IGRO3RU,"This is another cabin in the woods story. Michelle (AnnaMaria Demara) who takes meds has bad dreams about girls with bad hair and nasty contacts. They are so bad she wakes up with her high beams on. On top of all of that her bf Randy (Grant Alan Ouzts) has been cheating on her. She heads out to the family house and her four Delta sisters show up to comfort her...and play Ouija board in the demonically possessed cabin.

Dana (Michelle Nunes) has a bf Brian who she thinks is different from all the other guys.

Kelly (Jamie Strange) is our token blond who get nervous when they talk about Randy. She just broke up with her boyfriend who was ""just a guy.""

Jackie (Kate Siegel) likes Kelly who doesn't return the love.

Sharon (Kati Sharp) makes the film worth while. She likes to play jokes.

The film goes very well building character. I really started liking Sharon and then it happened. Possession is 6/10 ths of the film and it wasn't very good. They gave the possessed girls goofy make up and sped up the camera when they moved as if they had broken bones or something.  The film had a 5 star build up and then went stupid with too much too soon.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Nudity (AnnaMaria Demara, Cortney Palm, Kate Siegel )",1400889600,,1233,4.429203539823009
