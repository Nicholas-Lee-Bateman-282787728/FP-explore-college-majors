8688834,5,B00PMIZWH6,Here is another fireplace video I made with my brothers Jeff and Eric. Relax to the soft crackling of the fire and watch Jake the dog groom himself and sleep. I know it's pretty exciting stuff :). Seriously though...this is a very relaxing video to have running in the background this holiday season. The fireplace is decorated with Christmas decorations and Jake is taking it all in by the warmth of the fire.,1416009600,4,410,4.63013698630137
